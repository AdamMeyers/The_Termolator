<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ethnologist, who passes from the history
of the varieties of the human species of the world
at large, to the details of some special family,
tribe, or nation, is in the position of the naturalist
who rises from such a work as the <i>Systema Natur&aelig;</i>,
or the <i>R&egrave;gne Animal</i>, to concentrate his
attention on some special section or subsection
of the sciences of Zoology and Botany. If having
done this he should betake himself to some ponderous
folio, bulkier than the one which he read
last, but devoted to a subject so specific and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
limited as to have scarcely found a place in the
general history of organized beings, the comparison
is all the closer. The subject, in its main
characteristics, is the same in both cases; but
the difference of the details is considerable. A
topographical map on the scale of a chart of
the world, a manipulation for the microscope as
compared with the preparation of a wax model,
are but types and illustrations of the contrast.
A small field requires working after a fashion
impossible for a wide farm; often with different
implements, and often with different objects.
A dissertation upon the Negroes of Africa,
and a dissertation upon the Britons of the Welsh
Principality, though both ethnological, have but
few questions in common, at least in the present
state of our knowledge; and out of a hundred
pages devoted to each, scarcely ten would embody
the same sort of facts. With the Negro, we should
search amongst old travellers and modern missionaries
for such exact statements as we might
be fortunate enough to find respecting his geographical
position, the texture of his hair, the shade
of his skin, the peculiarities of his creed, the structure
of his language; and well satisfied should we
be if anything at once new and true fell in our
way. But in the case of the Briton all this is
already known to the inquirer, and can be conveyed
in a few sentences to the reader. What<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
then remains? A fresh series of researches, which
our very superiority of knowledge has developed;
inquiries which, with an imperfectly known population,
would be impossible. Who speculates to
any extent upon such questions as the degrees of
intermixture between the Moors and the true
Negroes of Nubia? Who grapples with such a
problem as the date of the occupation of New
Guinea? Such and such-like points are avoided;
simply because the <i>data</i> for working them are
wanting. Yet with an area like the British Isles,
they are both possible and pertinent. More than
this. In such countries there must either be no
ethnology at all, or it must be of the minute kind,
since the primary and fundamental questions,
which constitute nine-tenths of our inquiries elsewhere,
are already answered.</p>

<p>Minute ethnology must be more or less speculative&mdash;the
less the better. It must be so, however,
to some extent, because it attempts new
problems. Critical too it must be&mdash;the more the
better. It often works with unfamiliar instruments,
whose manipulation must be explained,
and whose power tested. Again, although the
field in which it works be wide, the tract in which
it moves may be beaten. An outlying question
may have been treated by many investigators,
and the results may be extremely different. In
British ethnology, the history of opinions only, if<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
given with the due amount of criticism, would fill
more than one volume larger than the present.</p>

<p>The above has been written to shew that any
work upon such a subject as the present must partake,
to a great degree, of the nature of a disquisition:
perhaps indeed, the term <i>controversy</i> would
not be too strong. The undeniable and recognized
results of previous investigators are truisms.
That the Britons and Gaels are Kelts, and that
the English are Germans is known wherever
Welsh dissent, Irish poverty, or English misgovernment
are the subjects of notice. What such
Kelticism or Germanism may have to do with
these same characteristics is neither so well ascertained,
nor yet so easy to discover. On the contrary,
there is much upon these points which may
be well <i>un</i>-learnt. Kelts, perchance, may not be
so very Keltic, or Germans so very German as is
believed; for it may be that a very slight preponderance
of the Keltic elements over the German,
or of the German over the Keltic may have determined
the use of the terms. Such a point as
this is surely worth raising; yet it cannot be
answered off-hand. At present, however, it is
mentioned as a sample of minute ethnology, and
as a warning of the disquisitional character which
the forthcoming pages, in strict pursuance to the
nature of the subject, must be expected to exhibit.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The extent, then, to which the two stocks that
occupy the British Isles are pure or mixed; the
characteristics of each stock in its purest form;
and the effects of intermixture where it has taken
place, are some of our problems; and if they could
each and all be satisfactorily answered, we should
have a Natural History of our Civilization. But
the answers are not satisfactory; at any rate they
are not conclusive. Nevertheless, a partial solution
can be obtained; a partial solution which is
certainly worth some efforts on the part of both
the reader and the writer. Other questions, too,
curious rather than of practical value, constitute
the department of minute ethnology; especially
when the area under notice is an island. The
<i>date</i> of its occupancy, although impossible as an
absolute epoch, can still be brought within certain
limits. Whether, however, such limits would
not be too wide for any one but a geologist, is
another question.</p>

<p>Now, if I have succeeded in shewing that criticism
and disquisition must necessarily form a
large part of such an ethnology as the one before
us, I have given a reason for what may, perhaps,
seem an apparent irregularity in the arrangement
of the different parts of the subject. With the
civil historian, the earliest events come first; for,
in following causes to their consequences, he begins
with the oldest. The ethnologist, on the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
other hand, whenever&mdash;as is rarely the case&mdash;he
can lay before the reader the whole process and
all the steps of his investigations, reverses this
method, and begins with the times in which he
lives; so that by a long series of inferences from
effect to cause, he concludes&mdash;so to say&mdash;at the
beginning; inasmuch as it is his special business
to argue backwards or upwards. Yet the facts of
the present volume will follow neither of these
arrangements exactly; though, of course, the order
of them will be, in the main, chronological. They
will be taken, in many cases, as they are wanted
for the purposes of the argument; so that if a fact
of the tenth century be necessary for the full
understanding of one of the fifth, it will be taken
out of its due order. Occasional transpositions of
this kind are to be found in all works wherein
the investigation of doubtful points preponderates
over the illustration of admitted facts, or in
all works where discussion outweighs exposition.</p>

<p>The period when the British Isles were occupied
by Kelts only (or, at least, supposed to have
been so) will form the subject of the earlier
chapters. The facts will, of course, be given as I
have been able to find them; but it may be not
unnecessary to state beforehand the nature of the
principal questions upon which they will bear.</p>

<p>The date of the first occupancy of the British
Isles by man is one of them. It can (as already<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
stated) only be brought within certain wide&mdash;very
wide&mdash;limits; and that hypothetically, or subject
to the accuracy of several preliminary facts.</p>

<p>The division of mankind to which the earliest
occupants belonged is the next; and it is closely
connected with the first. If the Kelts were the
earliest occupants of Britain, we can tell within
a few thousand years when they arrived. But
what if there were an occupation of Britain anterior
to theirs?</p>

<p>The civilization of the earliest occupants is a
question inextricably interwoven with the other
two; since the rate at which it advanced&mdash;if it
advanced at all&mdash;must depend upon the duration
of the occupancy, and the extent to which it was
the occupancy of one, or more than one, section of
mankind. But foreign intercourse may have accelerated
this rate, or a foreign civilization may
have altogether replaced that of the <i>indigen&aelig;</i>.
The evidence of this is a fourth question.</p>

<p>So interwoven with each other are all these
questions, that, although the facts of the first three
chapters will be arranged with the special view to
their elucidation, no statement of the results will
be given until the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons,
or the introduction of the great Germanic elements
of the British nation, leads us from the
field of early Keltic to that of early Teutonic research;
and that will not be until the details of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the Britons as opposed to the Gaels, of the Gaels
as opposed to the Britons, and of the Picts (as
far as they can be made out) have been disposed
of.</p>

<p>One of the populations of the British Isles, at
the present moment, speaks a language belonging
to the Keltic, the other one belonging to the
Teutonic class of tongues. However, it is by no
means certain that the blood, pedigree, race, descent,
or extraction coincides with the form of
speech: indeed it is certain that it does so but
partially. Though few individuals of Teutonic
extraction speak any of the Keltic dialects as
their mother-tongue, the converse is exceedingly
common; and numerous Kelts know no other
language but the English. Speech, then, is only
<i>prim&acirc; facie</i> evidence of descent; nevertheless, it
is the most convenient criterion we have.</p>

<p>The Keltic class falls into divisions and subdivisions.
The oldest and purest portion of the Gaelic
Kelts is to be found in Ireland, especially on
the western coast. Situated as Connaught is on
the Atlantic, it lies beyond the influx of any
new blood, except from the east and north;
yet from the east and north the introduction
of fresh populations has been but slight. Here,
then, we find the Irish Gael in his most typical
form.</p>

<p>Scotland, like Ireland, is <i>Gaelic</i> in respect to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
its Keltic population, but the stock is less pure.
However slight may be the admixture of English
blood in the Highlands and the Western Isles,
the infusion of Scandinavian is very considerable.
Caithness has numerous geographical terms whose
meaning is to be found in the Danish, Swedish,
Norwegian, and Icelandic. <i>Sutherland</i> shews its
political relations by its name. It is the <i>Southern
Land</i>; an impossible name if the county be considered
English (for it lies in the very <i>north</i> of
the island), but a natural name if we refer it to
Norway, of which Sutherland was, at one time, a
southern dependency, or (if not a dependency),
a robbing-ground. Orkney and Shetland were
once as thoroughly Norse as the Faroe Isles or
Iceland.</p>

<p>The third variety of the present British population
is in the Isle of Man, where a language
sufficiently like the Gaelic of Ireland and Scotland
to be placed in the same division, is still
spoken. Yet the blood is mixed. The Norsemen
preponderated in Man; and the constitution of the
island is in many parts Scandinavian, though the
language be Keltic.</p>

<p>In Wales the language and population are
still Keltic, though sufficiently different from the
Scotch, Irish, and Manx, to be considered as a
separate branch of that stock. It is conveniently
called <i>British</i>, <i>Cambrian</i>, and <i>Cambro-Briton</i>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
It is quite unintelligible to any Gael. Neither
can any Gael, talking Gaelic, make himself understood
by a Briton. On the other hand, however,
a Scotch and an Irish Gael understand each
other; whilst, with some effort, they understand a
Manxman, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. So that the number
of mutually unintelligible languages of the Keltic
stock is two; in other words, the Keltic dialects
of the British Isles are referable to two branches&mdash;the
British for the Welsh, and the Gaelic for
the Scotch, Irish, and Manx. The other language
of the British Isles is the English, one upon
which it is unnecessary to enlarge; but which
makes the third tongue in actual existence at the
present moment, if we count the Irish, Scotch,
and Manx as dialects of the same language, and
the fifth if we separate them.</p>

<p>By raising the Lowland Scotch to the rank of
a separate language, we may increase our varieties;
but, as it is only a general view which we
are taking at present, it is as well not to multiply
distinctions. I believe that, notwithstanding
some strong assertions to the contrary, there are
no two dialects of the English tongue&mdash;whether
spoken east or west&mdash;in North Britain or to the
South of the Tweed&mdash;that are not mutually intelligible,
when used as it is the usual practice
to use them. That strange sentences may be
made by picking out strange provincialisms, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
stringing them together in a manner that never
occurs in common parlance, is likely enough; but
that any two men speaking English shall be in
the same position to each other as an Englishman
is to a Dutchman or Dane, so that one shall not
know what the other says, is what I am wholly
unprepared to believe, both from what I have
observed in the practice of provincial speech, and
what I have read in the way of provincial glossaries.</p>

<p>The populations, however, just enumerated, represent
but a fraction of our ethnological varieties.
They only give us those of the nineteenth
century. Other sections have become extinct, or,
if not, have lost their distinctive characteristics,
which is much the same as dying out altogether.
The ethnology of these populations is a matter of
history. Beginning with those that have most
recently been assimilated to the great body of
Englishmen, we have&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The Cornishmen of Cornwall.&mdash;They are Britons
in blood, and until the seventeenth century,
were Britons in language also. When the Cornish
language ceased to be spoken it was still intelligible
to a Welshman; yet in the reign of Henry
II., although intelligible, it was still different.
Giraldus Cambrensis especially states that the
"Cornubians and Armoricans used a language
almost identical; a language which the Welsh,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
from origin and intercourse, understood in <i>many</i>
things, and <i>almost</i> in all."</p>

<p>2. The Cumbrians, of Cumberland, retained the
British language till after the Conquest. This
was, probably, spoken as far north as the Clyde.
Earlier, however, than either of these were&mdash;</p>

<p>3. The Picts.&mdash;The Cumbrian and Cornish Britons
were simply members of the same division
with the Welshmen, Welshmen, so to say, when
the Welsh area extended south of the Bristol
Channel and north of the Mersey. The Picts
were, probably, in a different category. They
may indeed have been Gaels. They have formed
a separate substantive division of Kelts. They
may have been no Kelts at all, but Germans or
Scandinavians.</p>

<p>But populations neither Keltic nor Teutonic
have, at different times, settled in England; populations
which (like several branches of the Keltic
stock) have either lost their distinctive characteristics,
or become mixed in blood, but which (unlike
such Kelts) were not indigenous to any of
the islands. Like the Germans or Teutons, on
the other hand, they were foreigners; but, unlike
the Germans or Teutons, they have not preserved
their separate substantive character. Still, some
of their blood runs in both English and Keltic
veins; some of their language has mixed itself
with both tongues; and some of their customs<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have either corrupted or improved our national
character. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The battle of Hastings filled England with
Normans, French in language, French and Scandinavian
in blood, but (eventually) English in
the majority of their matrimonial alliances. And
before the Normans came&mdash;</p>

<p>2. The Danes&mdash;and before the Danes&mdash;</p>

<p>3. The Romans.&mdash;Such is the general view of
the chief populations, past and present, of England;
of which, however, the Keltic and the Angle
are the chief.</p>

<p>The English-and-Scotch, the Normans, the
Danes, and the Romans have all been introduced
upon the island within the Historical period&mdash;some
earlier than others, but all within the last
2,000 years, so that we have a fair amount of
information as to their history; not so much,
perhaps, as is generally believed, but still a fair
amount. We know within a few degrees of latitude
and longitude where they came from; and
we know their ethnological relations to the occupants
of the parts around them.</p>

<p>With the Kelts this is not the case. Of Gael
or Manxman, Briton or Pict, we know next to
nothing during their early history. We can guess
where they came from, and we can infer their
ethnological relations; but history, in the strict
sense of the term, we have none; for the Keltic<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
period differs from that of all the others in being
pre-historic. This is but another way of saying
that the Keltic populations, and those only, are
the aborigines of the island; or, if not aboriginal,
the earliest known. Yet it is possible that these
same Keltic populations, whose numerous tribes
and clans and nations covered both the British
and the Hibernian Isles for generations and generations
before the discovery of the art of writing,
or the existence of a historical record, may be as
well understood as their invaders; since ethnology
infers where history is silent, and history,
even when speaking, may be indistinct. At any
rate, the previous notice of the ethnology of the
British Isles during the Historical period, prepares
us with a little light for the dark walk in the
field of its earliest antiquity.</p>

<p>Nothing, as has just been stated, in the earliest
historical records of Britain, throws any light
upon the original occupation of the British Islands
by man; indeed, nothing tells us that Britain,
when so occupied, was an island at all. The
Straits of Dover may have existed when the first
human being set foot upon what is now the soil
of Kent, or an isthmus may have existed instead.
Whether then it was by land, or whether it was
by water, that the population of Europe propagated
itself into England, is far beyond the evidence
of any historical memorial&mdash;far beyond the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
evidence of tradition. Nothing at present indicates
the nature of the primary migration of our
earliest ancestors. Neither does any historical record
tell us what manner of men first established
themselves along the valleys of the Thames and
Trent, or cleared the forests along their watersheds.
They may have been as much ruder than
the rudest of the tribes seen by Paulinus and
Agricola, as those tribes were ruder than ourselves.
They may, on the other hand, have enjoyed
a higher civilization, a civilization which
C&aelig;sar saw in its later stages only; one which
Gallic wars, and other evil influences, may have
impaired.</p>

<p>For the consideration of such questions as these
it matters but little whether we begin with the
information which the ambition of C&aelig;sar gave
the Romans the opportunity of acquiring, or such
accounts of the Ph&#339;nician traders as found their
way into the writings of the Greeks; Polybius
(for instance), Aristotle, or Herodotus. A few
centuries, more or less, are of trifling importance.
The social condition in both cases is the same.
There was tin in Cornwall, and iron swords in
Kent; in other words, there was the civilization
of men who knew the use of metals, both on the
side of the soldiers who followed Cassibelaunus
to fight against C&aelig;sar, and amongst the miners
and traders of the Land's-end. In both cases,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
too, there was foreign intercourse; with Gaul,
where there was a tincture of Roman, and with
Spain, where there was a tincture of Ph&#339;nician,
civilization. This is not the infancy of our species,
nor yet that of any of its divisions. For this
we must go backwards, and farther back still,
from the domain of testimony to that of inference,
admitting a pre-historic period, with its
own proper and peculiar methods of investigation&mdash;methods
that the ethnologist shares with the
geologist and naturalist, rather than with the
civil historian. In respect to their results, they
may be barren or they may be fertile; but,
whether barren or whether fertile, the practice
and application of them is a healthy intellectual
exercise.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that the use of metals,
and the contact with the Continent, which have
just been noticed, invalidate the statement as to
the insufficiency of our earliest historical notices.
It must not be thought that they tell us more than
they really do. It is only at the first view that
the knowledge of certain metallurgic processes,
and the trade and power that such knowledge
developes, are presumptions in favour of a certain
degree of antiquity in the occupancy of our
island on the parts of its islanders; and it is only
by forgetting the <i>insular</i> character of Great Britain
that we can allow ourselves to suppose that,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
though our early arts tell us nothing about our
first introduction, they at any rate prove that it
was <i>no recent event</i>. "Time," we may fairly say,
"must be allowed for such habits as are implied
by the use of metals to have developed themselves,
and, consequently, generations, centuries,
and possibly even millenniums must have elapsed
between the landing of the first vessel of the first
Britons, and the beginning of the trade with the
Kassiterides." As a general rule, such reasoning
is valid; yet the earliest known phenomena of
British civilization are compatible with a comparatively
modern introduction of its population.
For Great Britain may have been peopled like
Iceland or Madeira, <i>i.e.</i>, not a generation or two
after the peopling of the nearest parts of the opposite
Continent, but many ages later; in which
case both the population and its civilization may
be but things of yesterday. In the twelfth century,
Iceland had an alphabet and the art of writing.
Had these grown up within the island itself,
the inference would be that its population was of
great antiquity; since time must be allowed for
their evolution&mdash;even as time must be allowed
for the growth of acorns on an oak. But the art
may be newer than the population, or the population
and the art may be alike recent. Hence,
as the civilization of the earliest Britons may be
newer than the stock to which it belonged, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
testimony of ancient writers to its existence is
anything but conclusive against the late origin of
the stock itself. It is best to admit an absolutely
pre-historic period, and that without reservation;
and as a corollary, to allow that it may have differed
in kind as well as degree from the historic.</p>

<p>There is another fact that should be noticed.
The languages of Great Britain are reducible to
two divisions, both of which agree in many essential
points with certain languages or dialects of
Continental Europe. The British was closely,
the Gaelic more distantly, allied to the ancient
tongue of the Gauls. From this affinity we get
an argument <i>against</i> any extreme antiquity of
the Britons of the British Isles. The date of their
separation from the tribes of the Continent was
not so remote as to obliterate and annihilate all
traces of the original mother-tongue. It was not
long enough for the usual processes by which languages
are changed, to eject from even the Irish
Gaelic (the most unlike of the two) every word
and inflection which the progenitors of the present
Irish brought from Gaul, and to replace them
by others. So that, at the first view, we have
a limit in this direction; yet unless we have
settled certain preliminaries, the limit is unreal.
All that it gives us is the comparatively recent
introduction of the <i>Keltic</i> stock. Varieties of
the human species, <i>other than Keltic</i>, may have<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
existed at an indefinitely early period, and subsequently
have been superseded by the Kelts. Philology,
then, tells us little more than history;
and it may not be superfluous to add, that the
occupancy of Great Britain by a stock of the kind
in question, earlier than the Keltic, and different
from it, is no imaginary case of the author's, but
a doctrine which has taken the definite form of a
recognized hypothesis, and characterizes one of
the best ethnological schools of the Continent&mdash;the
Scandinavian.</p>

<p>For the ambitious attempt at a reconstruction
of the earliest state of the human kind in Britain,
we may prepare ourselves by a double series of
processes. Having taken society as it exists at
the present moment, we eject those elements of
civilization which have brought it to its present
condition, beginning with the latest first.
We then take up a smaller question, and consider
what arts and what forms of knowledge&mdash;what
conditions of society&mdash;existing amongst the
earlier populations have been lost or superseded
with ourselves. The result is an approximation
to the state of things in the infancy of our species.
We subtract (for instance) from the sum of
our present means and appliances such elements
as the knowledge of the power of steam, the art
of printing, and gunpowder; all which we can do
under the full light of history. Stripped of these,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
society takes a ruder shape. But it is still not
rude enough to be primitive. There are parts of
the earth's surface, at the present moment, where
the metals are unknown. There was, probably, a
time when they were known nowhere. Hence, the
influences of such a knowledge as this must be
subtracted. And then come weaving and pottery,
the ruder forms of domestic architecture, and
boat-building, lime-burning, dyeing, tanning, and
the fermentation of liquors. When and where
were such arts as these wanting to communities?
No man can answer this; yet our methods of investigation
require that the question should be
raised.</p>

<p>Other questions, too, which cannot be answered
must be suggested, since they serve to exhibit the
trains of reasoning that depend upon them. Was
Britain (a question already indicated) cut off
from Gaul by the Straits of Dover when it was
first peopled? If it were, the civilization required
for the building of a boat must have been one of
the attributes of the first aborigines; so that,
whatever else in the way of civilization may have
been evolved on British ground, the art of hollowing
a tree, and launching it on the waves was
foreign.</p>

<p>Now it is safe to say that the writers who are
most willing to assign a high antiquity to the
first occupation of the British Isles by Man, have<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
never carried their epoch so high as the time
when Britain and Gaul were joined by an isthmus.
On the contrary, they all argue as if the islands
were as insular as they are at present, and attribute
to the first settlers the construction and
management of some frail craft&mdash;rude, of course,
but still a seaworthy piece of mechanism&mdash;after
the fashion of the boats of Gaul or Germany; and
this is the reasonable view of the subject.</p>

<p>In Mr. Daniel Wilson's "Pre-historic Annals of
Scotland," we have the best <i>data</i> for the next
portion of the question, viz., the extent to which
geological changes have occurred since the first
occupancy of our islands. In the valley of the
Forth,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> alterations in the relations of the land
and sea to the amount of twenty-five feet have
occurred since the art of making deers' horns into
harpoons was known in Scotland. Such at least
is the inference from the discovery, in the Carse
lands about Blair Drummond Moss, of the skeleton
of a whale, with a harpoon beside it, twenty-five
feet above the present tides of the Forth. As
much as can be told by any single fact is told by
this; its valuation being wholly in the hands of
the geologists.</p>

<p>Then, the bone of an Irish elk, according to one
view (but <i>not</i> according to another), gives us a
second fact. A rib, with an oval opening, where<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
oval openings should not be, and with an irregular
effusion of callus around it, is found under
eleven feet of peat. Dr. Hart attributes this to a
sharp-pointed instrument, wielded by a human
hand, which without penetrating deep enough to
cause death, effected a breach on the continuity
of the bone, and caused inflammation to be set
up. But Professor Owen thinks that a weapon
of the kind in question, if left in, to be worked
out by the <i>vix medicatrix</i> of Nature, would be
fatal, and consequently he prefers the notion of
the wound having been inflicted by a weapon
which was quickly withdrawn, <i>e.g.</i>, the horn of
some combative rival of its own kind, rather than
the human. Now if it be a difficult matter to say
what will, and what will not kill a man in the
year '52, much more so is it to speak chirurgically
about Irish elks of the Pleiocene period. Hence
the evidence of man having been cotemporary
with the Megaceros Hibernicus is unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>That a certain amount, then, of change of level
between the land and sea, in a certain part of
Scotland, has taken place since Scotchmen first
hunted whales is the chief fact, relative to the
date of our introduction, that we get from geology.
From arch&aelig;ology we learn something
more. Those sepulchral monuments which have
the clearest and most satisfactory signs of antiquity,
contain numerous implements of stone and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
bone, <i>but none of metal</i>. When metal is found,
the concomitant characters of the tomb in which
it occurs, indicate a later period. If so, it is a
fair inference for the ethnological arch&aelig;ologist
to conclude, that although the earliest colonists
reached Britain late enough to avail themselves
of boats, their migration was earlier than the diffusion
of the arts of metallurgy. And this has induced
the best investigators to designate the earliest
stage in British ethnology by the name of the
<span class="smcap">Stone Period</span>, a technical and convenient term.</p>

<p>It is the general opinion, that during this period
the practice of inhumation, or simple burial,
was commoner than that of cremation or burning,
though each method was adopted. Over the remains
disposed of by the former process, were
erected mounds of earth (<i>tumuli</i> or <i>barrows</i>), heaps
of stone (<i>cairns</i>), or cromlechs. There are strong
suspicions that the practice of <i>Sutt&iacute;</i> was recognized.
Around a skeleton, more or less entire,
are often found, at regular distances, the ashes of
bodies that were burnt; just as if the chief was
interred in the flesh, but his subordinates given
over to the flames. The posture is, frequently,
one which, on the other side of the Atlantic, has
called forth numerous remarks. Throughout America,
it was observed by Dr. Morton, that one of
the most usual forms of burial was to place the
corpse in a half upright position, or a sitting attitude,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with the knees and hams bent, and the
arms folded on the legs. Now this is a common
posture in Britain&mdash;a clear proof of the extent to
which similar practices are independent of imitation.
If any ornaments be found with the corpse,
they are chiefly of cannel coal. The implements
are all of stone, or bone&mdash;the celt, the arrow, the
spear-head, the adze, and the mallet.</p>

<p>What was the physical aspect of the country at
this time? The present, <i>minus</i> the clearings&mdash;wood
and fen, fen and wood, in interminable succession;
woods of oak in the clay soils; of beech
on the chalk; of birch, pine, and fir in the northern
parts of the island. The boats were essentially
<i>monoxyla</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, single trees hollowed out,
sometimes by stone adzes, oftener by fire. The
chief dresses were the skins of beasts.</p>

<p>Such is what arch&aelig;ology tells us. The other
questions belong to the naturalist. What was the
ancient Fauna? Whether the earliest men were
cotemporaneous with the latest of the extinct
quadrupeds, has been already asked&mdash;the answer
being doubtful. How far the earliest beasts of
chase and domestication were the same as the present,
is a fresh question. The sheep may reasonably
be considered as a recent introduction; but with all
the other domestic animals there are, perhaps, as
good reasons for deriving them from native species
as for considering them to be of foreign origin.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The hog of the present breed, may indeed be of
continental origin; so may the present cat, horse,
and ass. Nevertheless, the hog, cat, horse, and
ass, whose bones are found in the alluvial deposits,
may have been domesticated. The Devonshire,
Hereford, and similar breeds of oxen may
be new; but the <i>bos longifrons</i> may have originated
<i>some</i> native breeds, which the inhabitants
of even the earliest period&mdash;the period of stone
and bone implements&mdash;may have domesticated.
The opinion of Professor Owen is in favour of this
view; and certainly, though it cannot be enforced
by mere authority, it is recommended by its simplicity,&mdash;avoiding,
as it does, the unnecessary
multiplication of causes. The goat was certainly
indigenous, but no more certainly domesticated
than the equally indigenous deer. This indigenous
rein-deer may or may not have been trained. The
miserable aliments of the beach, shell-fish and crustacea,
constituted no small part of the earliest
human food; and so (for the northern part of the
isle at least) did eggs, seals, and whales. Surely
in these primitive portions of the Stone period our
habits must have approached those of the Lap,
the Sam&ouml;eid, and the Eskimo, however different
they may be now.</p>

<p>But metals, in the course of time, were introduced;
first bronze, and then iron; gold and lead
being, perhaps, earlier than either, earlier too<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
than silver. Of gold we take but little notice.
It was not a useful metal; but subservient only
to the purposes of barbaric ornament. The next
fact is of great importance.</p>

<p><i>In those tombs where the implements are most
exclusively of stone, and where the other signs of
antiquity correspond, the skulls are of unusually
small capacity. In the next period they are
larger. There are also some notable points of
difference in the shape.</i> Such at least is the
current opinion; although the proofs that such
difference is not referable to difference of age or
sex, is by no means irrefragable. Still we may
take the fact as it is supposed and reported to be.</p>

<p>If we do this, we are prepared for another
question. How far is the introduction of metal
implements and of new arts, a sign of the introduction
of a fresh stock or variety of the human
species? How far, too, is the difference in the
capacity of the skulls? How far the fact of the
two changes coinciding? The answer has generally
been in the affirmative. The men who used
implements of bronze were Kelts; the men who
eked out their existence with nothing better than
adzes and arrow-heads of stone, were other than
Keltic. They were ante-Keltic aborigines, whom
a Keltic migration annihilated and superseded.
Such is the widely-spread doctrine. Yet it is
doubtful whether the premises bear out the inference&mdash;far<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
as it has been recognized. I doubt
it myself; because, admitting (for the sake of
argument) that there is a difference in the size
and the shape of the skulls, it by no means follows
that a difference of stock is the only way of accounting
for it. Improved implements, taken by
themselves, merely denote either a progress in the
useful arts, or, what is more likely, some new
commercial relations. The same improved implements,
if considered as means to an end, denote
an improvement in the nutrition of the individuals
who used them. The bones of a man who
hunts stags and oxen with bronze weapons will
carry more flesh, and consequently be more fuller
developed than those of a man who, for want of
better instruments than flint and bone arrow-heads,
feeds chiefly upon whale blubber and shell-fish.
Now, what applies to the bones in general,
applies&mdash;though perhaps in a less degree&mdash;to the
skull. In the difference, then, between the crania
of the Stone and Bronze periods I see no introduction
of a new variety of our species, but merely
the effects of a better diet, arising from an improvement
in the instruments for obtaining it.
If the assumption, then, of a <i>pre</i>-Keltic stock be
gratuitous, the question as to the date of our
population is considerably narrowed. Its introduction
(as already indicated) must have been
sufficiently late to allow the original affinities between<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the Keltic dialects of the British Isles, and
the Keltic dialects of the European Continent, to
remain visible. But as many millenniums would
be required for the opposite effect of obliterating
the original similarity, this is saying but little.
All that it is safe to assert is&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the primitive Britons occupied the
islands sufficiently <i>early</i> to allow of the relative
levels of the land and sea on the valley of the
Forth to alter to the amount of twenty-five feet&mdash;there
or thereabouts.</p>

<p>2. That they occupied it sufficiently <i>late</i> to
allow the common origin of the Gaelic and British
tongues to remain visible in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>This latter position rests upon the supposition
that the early inhabitants in question were of the
same stock as the present Welsh and Gaels&mdash;the
contrary doctrine being held to be, not erroneous,
but gratuitous and unnecessary.</p>

<p>We are now prepared to find that in certain
monuments, less ancient than those of the Stone
period, the enclosed relics are of metal, and that
this metal is an alloy of copper and tin&mdash;<i>bronze</i>&mdash;not
<i>brass</i>, which is an alloy of copper and zinc.
Not only are such relics more elaborate in respect
to their workmanship, but the kinds of them are
more varied. They are referable indeed to the
three classes of warlike instruments, industrial
implements, and personal ornaments, but the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
varieties of each sort are comparatively numerous.
Swords and shields, which would be well-nigh
impossible accoutrements during the Stone
period, now come into use; so do moulds for
casting, as well as bracelets and necklaces. In
short, the signs of a higher civilization and fresh
means for the conquest of either Man or Nature
appear.</p>

<p>The evidence that the Bronze period succeeded
the Stone, is on the whole satisfactory; indeed its
<i>a priori</i> likelihood is so great, as to make a little
go a long way. At the same time, it must not be
supposed that in each individual case the newest
monuments wherein we find bone and stone are
older than the oldest wherein we find bronze.
No line of demarcation thus trenchant can be
drawn; and no proofs of absolute succession thus
conclusive can be discovered. Upon the whole,
however, there was a time when the early Britons
were in the position of the South Sea Islanders
when first discovered, <i>i.e.</i>, ignorant of the use of
metals. As long as the arts of metallurgy are
unknown, the notice of the physical conditions of
the country is confined to its Flora, its Fauna,
and its stone quarries. What was there to cultivate?
What was there to hunt or to domesticate?
What was there to build with? Now,
however, the questions change. What were the
mineral resources of the soil? It is not necessary<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to enlarge on these. The use of coal as a
fuel is wholly recent. On the other hand, certain
varieties of it were used as ornaments&mdash;the
cannel coal, and the bituminous shale of Dorsetshire
(Kimmeridge clay). So was jet.</p>

<p>The metal first worked was <i>gold</i>; and its use
dates as far back as the Stone period; indeed it
may belong to the very earliest age of our island;
since the localities where it has been found in
Great Britain are by no means few; and in early
times each was richer than at present. In England,
from Alston Moor; in Scotland, from the
head-waters of the Clyde; and in Ireland, from
the Avonmore, gold for the adornment of even
the hunters of the bone spear-head, and the woodsmen
of the stone-hatchet might have been procured;
and the simple art of working it, although
it may possibly have been Gallic in origin, may
quite as easily have been native. The chief gold
ornaments, torcs, armill&aelig;, and fibul&aelig; have been
found in association with bronze articles, but not
exclusively.</p>

<p>With those arch&aelig;ologists and ethnologists who
believe that the introduction of bronze implements
coincided with the advent of a new variety
of mankind, the question whether the art of alloying
and casting metals was of native or foreign
origin, is a verbal one; since it was native or
foreign just as we define the term&mdash;native to the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
stock which introduced it on the British soil,
foreign to the soil itself. But as soon as we demur
to the notion that the earliest Britons were
a separate and peculiar stock, and commit ourselves
to the belief that they were simply Kelts in
a ruder condition, the problem presents itself in a
different and more important form. Was the art
of making an alloy of tin and copper self-evolved,
or was it an art which foreign commerce introduced?
Was the art of casting such alloys British?
It is well to keep the two questions separate.
The preliminary facts in respect to the history
of the bronze metallurgy are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The peculiar geographical distribution of tin,
which of all the metals of any wide practical utility
is found in the fewest localities, those localities
being far apart, <i>e.g.</i>, Britain and Malacca&mdash;</p>

<p>2. The wide extent of country over which
bronze implements are found. Except in Norway
and Sweden, where the use of iron seems to
have immediately followed that of stone and bone,
they have been found all over Europe&mdash;</p>

<p>3. The narrow limits to the proportions of alloy&mdash;nine-tenths
copper, and one-tenth tin&mdash;there or
thereabouts&mdash;in the majority of cases.</p>

<p>4. The considerable amount of uniformity in
the shape of even those implements wherein a
considerable variety of form is admissible. Thus
the bronze sword&mdash;a point hereafter to be noticed&mdash;is<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
almost always long, leaf-shaped, pointed,
and without a handle.</p>

<p>The last three of these facts suggest the notion
that bronze metallurgy originated with a single
population; the first, that that population was
British. Yet neither of these inferences is unimpeachable.</p>

<p>The notion that the bronze implements themselves
were made in any single country, and thence
diffused elsewhere, has but few upholders; since,
in most of the countries where they have been
found, the moulds for making them have been
found also. Hence the doctrine that the raw
material&mdash;the mixed metal only&mdash;was brought
from some single source is the more important
one. Yet chemical investigations have modified
even this.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The proportions in question are the
best, and they are easily discovered to be so.
Seven parts copper to one of tin has been shewn
by experiment to be too brittle, and fifteen parts
copper to one of tin too soft, for use. Within
these proportions the chief analyses of the ancient
bronze implements range. The exact proportion
of ten copper to one of tin, Mr. Wilson has shewn
to be an overstatement. All then that we are
warranted to infer is, that Britain was the chief
source of the tin.</p>
<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>This is a great fact in the annals of our early
commerce, but not necessarily of much importance
in the natural history of our inventions; since
it by no means follows that because Cornwall
supplied tin to such adventurous merchants as
sought to buy it, it therefore discovered the art
of working it.</p>

<p>The chief reason for believing that the art of
working in any metal except gold was as foreign
to Britain as the alphabet was to Greece, rests on
a negative fact, of which too little notice has been
taken. Copper is a metal of which England produces
plenty. It is a metal, too, which is the
easiest worked of all, except gold and lead. It is
the metal which savage nations, such as some of
the American Indians, work when they work no
other; and, lastly, it is a metal of which, in its
unalloyed state, no relics have been found in
England. Stone and bone first; then bronze or
copper and tin combined; but no copper alone. I
cannot get over this hiatus&mdash;cannot imagine a
metallurgic industry <i>beginning with the use of
alloys</i>. Such a phenomenon is a plant without the
seed; and, as such, indicates transplantation rather
than growth.</p>

<p>This view assists us in our chronology. If the
art of working in bronze be a native and independent
development, its antiquity may be of any
amount&mdash;going back to 3000 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span> as easily as to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
2000 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>, and to 2000 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span> as easily as to 1000 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>
It may be of any age whatever, provided only
that it be later than the Stone period. But if it
be an exotic art, it must be subsequent to the
rise of the Ph&#339;nician commerce. Such I believe
to have been the case. That the Britons were apt
learners, and that they soon made the art their
own, is likely. The existence of bronze and stone
moulds for adzes and celts proves this.</p>

<p>The effects of the introduction of metal implements
would be two-fold. It would act on the
social state of the occupants of the British Isles,
and act on the physical condition of the soil. The
opportunities of getting stones and bones for the
purposes of warfare, would be pretty equally distributed
over the islands, so that the means of
attack and defence would be pretty equal throughout;
but the use of bronze would give a vast preponderance
of power to certain districts, Cornwall,
Wales, and the copper countries. The vast forests,
too, upon which stone hatchets would have but
little effect, would be more easily cleared, and
their denizens would be more successfully hunted.</p>

<p><i>Amber</i> ornaments are found along with the
implements of bronze. Do these imply foreign
commerce&mdash;commerce with the tribes of Courland
and Prussia&mdash;the pre-eminent amber localities?
Not necessarily. Amber, in smaller quantities,
is found in Britain.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Glass</i> beads, too, are found. This, I think, <i>does</i>
imply commerce. At any rate, I am slow to believe
that the art of fusing glass was of indigenous
growth. The use of it was, most probably, a concomitant
of the tin trade.</p>

<p>Undoubted specimens of weaving and undoubted
specimens of pottery, occur during the
Bronze period. Lead, too, is found in some of the
bronze alloys; the word itself being, apparently,
of Keltic origin. Whether the same could not be
referred to the Stone period is uncertain. It is
probable, however, that whilst the implements
were of stone and bone, the dress was of skin.</p>

<p>Nothing has yet been said about the dwellings
of the early islanders. This is because it is difficult
to assign a date to their remains. They may
belong to the Bronze&mdash;they may belong to the
Stone period. They may be more recent than
either. At any rate, however, relics of ancient
domestic architecture exist. A foundation sunk in
the earth, with stone walls of loose masonry, and
covered, most probably, with reeds and branches,
suggests the idea of a subterranean granary, for
which the old houses of the earliest Britons have
been mistaken; but, nevertheless, it belonged to
a house. On the floor of this we find charred
bones, and enormous heaps of oyster and mussel
shells. Stone handmills, too, denote the use of
corn; though from the character of the ancient<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Flora, vegetable forms of food must have been
rarer than animal.</p>

<p>Iron was known in C&aelig;sar's time. How much
earlier is doubtful. So was silver. Both were of
later date than gold and bronze; and more than
this it is not safe to say. Of the great monolithic
buildings, it is reasonable to suppose that they are
later than the Stone, and earlier than the Historical,
period. Druidism, however, in its germs
may be of any antiquity; not, however, if we suppose
that the first introduction of bronze coincided
with the first introduction of the Kelts.</p>

<p>An Iron period succeeds the Bronze; but it will
not be the subject of our immediate consideration,
inasmuch as it coincides pretty closely with the
historic epoch. The sequence, however, requires
further notice. That there should be a period in
the history of mankind when the use of metals,
and the arts of metallurgy were wholly unknown,
and that during such a period, imperfect implements
of bone and stone should minister to the
wants of an underfed and defenceless generation, is
not so much a particular fact in British ethnology
as a general doctrine founded upon our <i>a priori</i>
views, and applicable to the history of man at
large. For if each of the useful arts have its own
proper origin, referrible to some particular place,
time, and community, there must have been an
era when it was wanting to mankind. Hence,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
an ante-metallic age is as much the conception of
the speculator, as the discovery of the investigator.</p>

<p>The <i>order</i> in which the metals are discovered,
the leading problem in what may be called the
natural history of metallurgy, is far more dependant
upon induction. Induction, however, has given
the priority to copper, just as is expected from the
comparative reducibility of its ores&mdash;lead and
gold being put out of the question. So that it is
not so much the general fact of the order of succession
in respect to the Stone, Copper, and Iron
periods that the laudable investigations of British
arch&aelig;ologists have established as the nature of
the concomitant details, the modifications of the
periods themselves, and the exact character of
their sequence. Under each of these heads there
is much worth notice. The difference between
the shape and size of the skulls of the Stone and
Bronze periods has been broadly asserted&mdash;perhaps
it has been exaggerated, at any rate it has
formed the basis of an hypothesis. The substitution
of a Bronze for a Copper period in Britain
is an important modification, mainly attributable
to the existence of tin. The comparative completeness
of the sequence is interesting. It by no
means follows that it should be regular. In Norway
there is no Bronze period at all; but Bone
and Stone in the first instance, and Iron immediately
afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>extant</i> writers anterior to the time of
Julius C&aelig;sar, in whose works notice of the
British islands are to be found, are, at most, but
four in number. They are all, of course, Greek.</p>

<p>Herodotus is the earliest. He writes "of the
extremities of Europe towards the west, I cannot
speak with certainty ... nor am I acquainted
with the islands Cassiterides, from which tin is
brought to us."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;iii. 115.</p>

<p>Aristotle is the second. "Beyond the Pillars
of Hercules," he tells us, "the ocean flows round
the earth; in this ocean, however, are two islands,
and those very large, called Britannic, Albion
and Ierne, which are larger than those beforementioned,
and lie beyond the Celti; and other
two not less than these, Taprobane, beyond the
Indians, lying obliquely in respect of the main
land, and that called Phebol, situate over against<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the Arabic Gulf; moreover not a few small islands,
around the Britannic Isles and Iberia, encircle as
with a diadem this earth; which we have already
said to be an island."&mdash;<i>De Mundo</i>, &sect;. 3.</p>

<p>Polybius comes next. "Perhaps, indeed, some
will inquire why, having made so long a discourse
concerning places in Libya and Iberia, we have
not spoken more fully of the outlet at the Pillars
of Hercules, nor of the interior sea, and of the
peculiarities which occur therein, nor yet indeed
of the Britannic Isles, and the working of tin;
nor again, of the gold and silver mines of Iberia;
concerning which writers, controverting each
other, have discoursed very largely."&mdash;iii. 57.</p>

<p>Lastly come half-a-dozen lines of doubtful antiquity,
which the editors of the "<i>Monumenta Britannica</i>"
have excluded from their series of extracts,
on the score of their being taken from a
non-existent or impossible author&mdash;a bard of no
less importance than Orpheus. The ship Argo is
supposed to speak, and say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"For now by sad and painful trouble<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I be encompassed, if I go too near the <i>Iernian Islands</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For unless, by bending within the holy headland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sail within the bays of the land, and the barren sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall go outward into the Atlantic Ocean."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>An important sentence occurs a few lines lower.
The British Isles are spoken of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"where (are) the wide houses of Demeter."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>This will be noticed in the sequel.</p>

<p>No reason for excluding these lines lies in the
fact of their being forgeries. Provided that they
were composed before the time of C&aelig;sar, the
authorship matters but little. If, as is the common
practice, we attribute them to Onomacritus,
a cotemporary of Mardonius and Miltiades, they
are older than the notice of Herodotus.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that these <i>data</i> for the times
anterior to C&aelig;sar are scanty. A little consideration
will shew that they can be augmented. Between
the time of Julius C&aelig;sar and Claudius&mdash;a
period of nearly a hundred years&mdash;no new information
concerning Britain beyond that which was
given by C&aelig;sar himself, found its way to Rome;
since neither Augustus nor Tiberius followed up
the aggressions of the Great Dictator. Consequently,
the notices in the "<i>Bellum Gallicum</i>" exhaust
the subject as far as it was illustrated by any
Roman observers. Now if we find in any writer
of the time of Augustus or Tiberius, notices of our
island which can not be traced to C&aelig;sar, they
must be referred to other and earlier sources; and
may be added to the list of the <i>Greek</i> authorities.</p>

<p>If we limit these overmuch, we confine ourselves
unnecessarily. Inquiry began as early as
the days of Herodotus; and opportunities increased
as time advanced. The Baltic seems to
have been visited when Aristotle wrote; and between<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
his era and that of Polybius the intellectual
activity of the Alexandrian Greeks had begun
to work upon many branches of science&mdash;upon
none more keenly than physical geography.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the Historical period, the
first-hand information&mdash;for it is almost superfluous
to remark that none of the Greek authors
speak from personal observation&mdash;flows from
two sources; from the inhabitants of western and
southern Gaul, and from the Ph&#339;nicians. The
text of Herodotus suggests this. In the passage
which has been quoted, he speaks of the <i>Kassiterides</i>;
and <i>Kassiterides</i> is a term which a Ph&#339;nician
only would have used. No Gaul would
have understood the meaning of the word. It
was the Asiatic name for either tin itself, or for
some tin-like alloy; and the passage wherein it
occurs is one which follows a notice of <i>Africa</i>.</p>

<p>In two other passages, however, the consideration
of the populations and geography of Western
Europe is approached from another quarter. The
course of the Danube is under notice, and this is
what is said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The river Ister, beginning with the Kelts,
and the city of Pyrene, flows so as to cut Europe in
half. But the Kelts are beyond the Pillars of
Hercules; and they join the <i>Kynesii</i>, who are the
furthest inhabitants of Europe towards the setting-sun."&mdash;ii.
33.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Ister flows through the whole of Europe,
beginning with the Kelts who, next to the <i>Kynet&aelig;</i>,
dwell furthest west in Europe."&mdash;iv. 49.</p>

<p>The <i>Kynet&aelig;</i> have reasonably been identified
with the <i>Veneti</i> of C&aelig;sar, whose native name is
<i>Gwynedd</i>, and whose locality, in Western Brittany,
exactly coincides with the notice of Herodotus.
If so, the name is Gallic, and (as such) in
all probability transmitted to Herodotus from
Gallic informants. So that there were two routes
for the earliest information about Britain&mdash;the
overland line (so to say), whereon the intelligence
was of Gallic origin; and the way of the Mediterranean,
wherein the facts were due to the merchants
of Tyre, Carthage, or Gades. Direct information,
too, may have been derived from the
Greeks of Marseilles, though the evidence for this
is wanting.</p>

<p>The two foremost writers to whose texts the
preceding observations have been preliminary,
are Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, both of whom
lived during the reign of Augustus, too early for
any information over and above that which was
to be found in the pages of C&aelig;sar. Yet as each
contains much that C&aelig;sar never told, and, perhaps,
never knew, the immediate authorities
must be supposed to be geographical writers of
Alexandria, one of whom, Eratosthenes, is quoted
by C&aelig;sar himself; the remoter ones being the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Ph&#339;nician and Gallic traders. The thoroughly
Ph&#339;nician origin of the statement of these two
authors is well collected from the following extracts,
which we must consider to be as little
descriptive of the Britannia of C&aelig;sar and the
Romans, as they are of the Britannia of the year
51 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span> C&aelig;sar's Britain is Kent, in the last half-century
before the Christian era. Diodorus' Britain
is Cornwall, some 300 years earlier. "They
who dwell near the promontory of Britain, which
is called Belerium, are singularly fond of strangers;
and, from their intercourse with foreign
merchants, civilized in their habits. These people
obtain the tin by skilfully working the soil which
produces it; this being rocky, has earthy interstices,
in which, working the ore and then fusing,
they reduce it to metal; and when they have
formed it into cubical shapes they convey it to
certain islands lying off Britain, named Ictis; for
at the low tides, the intervening space being laid
dry, they carry thither in waggons the tin in great
abundance. A singular circumstance happens
with respect to the neighbouring islands lying between
Europe and Britain; for, at the high tides,
the intervening passage being flooded, they seem
islands; but at the low tides, the sea retreating
and leaving much space dry, they appear peninsulas.
From hence the merchants purchase the
tin from the natives, and carry it across into Gaul;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and finally journeying by land through Gaul for
about thirty days, they convey their burdens on
horses to the outlet of the river Rhone."&mdash;v. 21, 22.</p>

<p>So is Strabo's.&mdash;"The Cassiterides are ten in
number, and lie near each other in the ocean, towards
the north from the haven of the Artabri.
One of them is a desert, but the others are inhabited
by men in black cloaks, clad in tunics
reaching to the feet, and girt about the breast.
Walking with staves, and bearded like goats; they
subsist by their cattle, leading for the most part a
wandering life. And having metals of tin and
lead, these and skins they barter with the merchants
for earthenware, and salt, and brazen vessels.
Formerly the Ph&#339;nicians alone carried on
this traffic from Gadeira, concealing the passage
from every one; and when the Romans followed a
certain ship-master, that they also might find the
mart, the ship-master, out of jealousy, purposely
ran his vessel upon a shoal, and leading on those
who followed him into the same destructive disaster,
he himself escaped by means of a fragment
of the ship, and received from the State the value
of the cargo he had lost. But the Romans, nevertheless,
making frequent efforts, discovered the
passage; and as soon as Publius Crassus, passing
over to them, perceived that the metals were dug
out at a little depth, and that the men being at
peace were already beginning, in consequence of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
their leisure, to busy themselves about the sea, he
pointed out this passage to such as were willing
to attempt it, although it was longer than that
to Britain."&mdash;Lib. iii. p. 239.</p>

<p>Pliny is, to a great degree, in the same predicament
with Strabo and Diodorus. Some of the
statements which are not common to him and
C&aelig;sar, are undoubtedly referrible to the information
which the conquest of Britain under Claudius
supplied. Yet the greater part of them is old
material&mdash;Greek in origin, and, as such, referrible
to Western rather than Eastern Britain, and to the
era of the Carthaginians rather than the Romans.
Solinus' account is of this character; his <i>Britain</i>
being Western Britain and Ireland almost exclusively.</p>

<p>A poem of Festus Avienus, itself no earlier than
the end of the fourth century, concludes the list
of those authors who represent the predecessors
of C&aelig;sar in the description of Britain. Recent as
it is, it is important; since some of the details are
taken from the voyage of Himilco, a Carthaginian.
He supplies us with a commentary upon
the word <i>Demeter</i>, in the so-called Orphic poem&mdash;a
commentary which will soon be exhibited.</p>

<p>The points then of contact between the British
Isles and the Continent of Europe, were two in
number. They were far apart, and the nations
that visited them were different. Both, indeed,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
were in the south; but one was due east, the
other due west. The first, or Kentish Britain,
was described late, described by C&aelig;sar, commercially
and politically connected with Gaul, and
known to a great extent from Gallic accounts.
The second, or Cornish Britain, was in political
and commercial relation with the Ph&#339;nician portions
of Spain and Africa, or with Ph&#339;nicia itself;
was known to the cotemporaries of Herodotus,
and was associated with Ireland in more than
one notice. Both were British. But who shall
answer for the uniformity of manners throughout?
It is better to be on our guard against the influence
of general terms, and to limit rather than
extend certain accounts of early writers. A practice
may be called British, and yet be foreign to
nine-tenths of the British Islands. There were
war-chariots in Kent and in Aberdeenshire, and
so far war-chariots were part of the British armoury;
but what authority allows us to attribute
to the old Cornishmen and Devonians? Better
keep to particulars where we can.</p>

<p>As the ancient name for the populations of
Cornwall and Devonshire was <i>Damnonii</i>, the
<i>Damnonii</i> will be dealt with separately. It will
be time enough to call them Britons when a more
general term becomes necessary. Two-thirds of
the notice of them have been given already in the
extracts from Strabo and Diodorus, in which the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
long beards and black dress must be noticed for
the sake of contrast. No such description would
suit the Britons of the eastern coast.</p>

<p>The so-called <i>Orphic</i> poem places the <i>wide
houses of the goddess Demeter</i> in Britain. Standing
by itself, this is a mysterious passage. But it
has been said that an extract from Avienus will
help to explain it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;"Hic chorus ingens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faminei c&#339;tus pulchri colit orgia Bacchi.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Producit noctem ludus sacer; aera pulsant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vocibus, et crebris late sola calcibus urgent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non sic Absynthi prope flumina Thracis alumn&aelig;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bistonides, non qua celeri ruit agmine Ganges,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indorum populi stata curant festa Ly&aelig;o."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>There were maddening orgies amongst the
sacred rites of the Britons&mdash;orgies, that whilst
they reminded one writer of the Bacchic dances,
reminded another of the worship of Demeter.
That these belonged to the western Britons is an
inference from the fact of their being mentioned
by the Greek writers, <i>i.e.</i>, from those who drew
most from Ph&#339;nician authorities. Avienus, as we
have seen, thinks of the Bacch&aelig; as a parallel. So
does Pausanius&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;">
<span class="i0">"Nec spatii distant Nesidum litora longe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In quibus uxores Amnitum Bacchica sacra<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concelebrant, heder&aelig; foliis tect&aelig;que corymbis."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>So does Dionysius Periegetes; indeed the three
accounts seem all referrible to one source. But<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
not so Strabo. That writer, or rather his authority
Artemidorus, finds his parallel in Ceres. "Artemidorus
states, with regard to Ceres and Proserpine,
what is more worthy of credit. For
he says, that there is an island near Britain
wherein are celebrated sacred rites, similar to
such as are celebrated in Samothrace to these
goddesses."</p>

<p>Strabo's&mdash;or rather Artemidorus'&mdash;parallel is
the same as that of the Orphic poem, and, probably,
is referrible to the same source. Damnonian
Britain, then, or the tin-country, had its orgies&mdash;orgies
which may as easily have been Ph&#339;nician
as indigenous, and as easily indigenous as
Ph&#339;nician: orgies, too, may have been wholly
independent of Druidism, and representative of
another superstition.</p>

<div class="snt"><span class="smcapl">B.C.</span><br />57.</div>

<p>Between the Damnonian Britons of the Land's-end
and the Britons of Kent, as described by
C&aelig;sar, there may or there may not have been
strong points of contrast. That there were several
minor points of difference is nearly certain.
The <i>a priori</i> probabilities arising from the peculiarities
of their industrial occupations and commercial
relations suggest the view; the historical
notices confirm rather than invalidate it. Fragments,
however, of this history is all that can be
collected. We have followed the Alexandrian
critics in the west; let us now follow a personal<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
observer in the east, C&aelig;sar&mdash;himself <i>a great part
of the events</i> that he describes. The Britons of
Kent first appear as either tributaries or
subjects to one of the Gallic chiefs, Divitiacus,
king of the Suessiones, or people of Soissons
in Champagne; so that they are the members of
a considerable empire, or at least of an important
political confederation, before a single Roman
plants his foot on their island. But the vassalage
is either partial or nominal, nor is it limited
to the members of the Belgic branch of the Gauls;
for the Veneti were a people of Brittany, whose
name is still preserved under the form Vannes,
the name of a Breton district, and who were
true Galli. Yet, in the next year, they call
upon the Britons for assistance, which is
afforded them, in the shape of ships and sailors;
the Veneti being amongst the most maritime of
the Gallic populations.</p>

<div class="snt"><span class="smcapl">B.C.</span><br />56.</div>

<p>In looking at these two alliances it may, perhaps,
be allowed us to suppose that the parts
most under the control of Divitiacus were the
districts that lay nearest to him, Kent and Herts;
whereas it was the southern coast that was in so
intimate a relation with the Veneti. This is what
I meant when I said that the sovereignty of Divitiacus
might have been partial.</p>

<div class="snt"><span class="smcapl">B.C.</span><br />55.</div>

<p>C&aelig;sar prepares to punish the islanders
for their assistance to his continental enemies;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
partly tempted by the report of the value
of the British pearls, a fact which indicates commerce
and trade between the two populations.
The Britons send ambassadors, whom C&aelig;sar sends
back, and along with them Commius the <i>Attrebatian</i>,
a man of the parts about <i>Artois</i>. <i>Commius</i>
the <i>Crooked</i>, as, possibly, he was named, from the
Keltic <i>Cam</i>, and a namesake of the valiant Welshman
David <i>Gam</i>, who fought so valiantly more
than 1300 years afterwards at Agincourt. He
was a king of C&aelig;sar's own making, and had had
dealings with the Britons before; with whom he
had, also, considerable authority. From him
C&aelig;sar seems to have obtained his chief preliminary
information. But he applied to traders as
well; telling us, however, that it was only the
coast of Britain that was at all well known. He
is resisted and cut off from supplies at landing, and
unexpectedly attacked after he has succeeded in
doing so. So that he finds reason to respect both
the valour and the prudence of his opponents;
and, eventually leaves the country for Gaul, having
demanded hostages from the different States.
Two, only, send them.</p>

<div class="snt"><span class="smcapl">B.C.</span><br />54.</div>

<p>The following year the invasion is repeated.
In the first we had a few details,
but no names of either the clans, or their chief.
The second is more fruitful in both. It gives us
the campaign of Cassibelaunus. The most formidable<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
part of the British armoury was the
war-chariots. These were driven up and down,
before and into, the hostile ranks, by charioteers
sufficiently skilful to keep steady in rough places
and declivities, to take up their master when
pressed, to wheel round and return to the charge
with dangerous dexterity. Meanwhile the master,
himself, either hurled his javelins on the
enemy from a short distance, or jumping from
the chariot&mdash;from the body or yoke indifferently&mdash;descended
on the ground, and fought single-handed.
When pressed by the cavalry they retreated
to the woods; which, in many cases, were
artificially strengthened by stockades.</p>

<p>About eighty miles from the sea, C&aelig;sar reached
the boundaries of the kingdom of Cassibelaunus,
now the head of the whole Britannic Confederacy;
but until the discordant populations
became united by a sense of their common danger,
an aggressive and ambitious warrior, involved
in continuous hostilities with the populations
around. His name is evidently compound. The
termination, -<i>belaunus</i>, or -<i>belinus</i>, we shall meet
with again. The <i>Cass</i>- is not unreasonably supposed
to exist at the present moment in the name
of the Hundred of <i>Cassio</i>, in Herts (whence
<i>Cassio</i>-bury).</p>

<p>This is the first British proper name. The
next is that of the <i>Trinobantes</i>&mdash;beginning with<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the common Keltic prefix (<i>tre</i>-) meaning <i>place</i>.
Imanuentius, the king, had been slain in some
previous act of aggression by Cassibelaunus, and
his son Mandubratius had fled to C&aelig;sar whilst in
Gaul. He is now restored upon giving hostages.</p>

<p>In the list which follows of the population
who sent hostages to C&aelig;sar, we find the name
of the <i>Cassi</i>; which suggests the notion of Cassibelaunus'
own subjects have become unfaithful to
him. The others are Cenimagni, the Segontiaci,
the Ancalites, and the Bibroci.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar seems now to be in Hertfordshire, west
of London, <i>i.e.</i>, about Cassio-bury, the stockaded
village, or head-quarters, of Cassibelaunus&mdash;Cassibelaunus
himself being in Kent. Here he succeeds
in exciting four chiefs, Cingetorix (observe
the Keltic termination, -<i>orix</i>), Carvilius, Taximagulus,
and Segonax, to attack the ships; in which
attempt they are repulsed with the loss of one of
their principal men, Lugot-<i>orix</i>.</p>

<p>The campaign ends in C&aelig;sar coming to terms
with Cassibelaunus, forbidding any attacks during
his absence on Mandubratius and the Trinobantes,
and returning to Gaul with hostages.</p>

<p>From an incidental notice of the British boats
in a different part of C&aelig;sar's books, we learn that
those on the Thames, like those on the Severn,
were made of wicker-work and hides&mdash;<i>coracles</i> in
short; and from a passage of Avienus we learn<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that the Severn boats were like those of the
Thames&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;">

<span class="i0">Corioque vastum s&aelig;pe percurrunt salum.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>C&aelig;sar's conquest was to all intents and purposes
no conquest at all. Nevertheless, Augustus
received British ambassadors, and, perhaps, a
nominal tribute. Probably, this was on the
strength of the dependence of the Eastern Britons
on some portion of Gaul. At any rate, there
was no invasion.</p>

<div class="snt"><span class="smcapl">A.D.</span><br />20<br />to<br />43.</div>

<p>The latter part of the reign of Tiberius,
and the short one of Caligula, give us the
palmy period for native Britain&mdash;the reign
of Cynobelin, the father of Caractacus, the
last of her independent kings.</p>

<p>Coins have been found in many places; but as
it is not always certain that they were not Gallic,
the proofs of a very early coinage in Britain is inconclusive.
Indeed, the notion that the tin trade&mdash;to
which may be added that in fur and salt&mdash;was
carried on by barter is the more probable.
But the coins of Cynobelin are numerous.
They have been well illustrated;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> are of gold and
silver; and whether stamped in Gaul or Britain,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
indicate civilization of commerce and industry.
The measure of the progress of Britain from the
Stone period upwards, partly referrible to indigenous
development, partly to Gallic, and partly to
Ph&#339;nician, intercourse, is to be found in these
coins. It is the civilization of a brave people
endowed with the arts of agriculture and metallurgy,
capable of considerable political organization,
and with more than one point of contact
with the continent&mdash;their war-chariots, their language,
and their Druidism being their chief distinctive
characters. Iron was in use at this time&mdash;though,
perhaps, it was rare.</p>

<p>The conquests under Claudius carry us over
new localities; and they are related by a great
historian, with more than ordinary means of information.
In Tacitus we read the accounts of
Agricola. Yet the information, with the exception
of a few interesting details, is confirmatory of
what we have been told before, rather than suggestive
of any essential differences between the
Britons of the interior and the Britons of the
southern coast. The war-chariot was limited to
certain districts. The rule of a woman was tolerated.
The wives and mothers looked-on upon
the battles of the husbands and daughters. They
may be said, indeed, to have shared in them.
Their cries, and shrieks, and reproaches, their
dishevelled hair, all helped to stimulate the warriors,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
who opposed Suetonius Paulinus in the fastnesses
of the Isle of Anglesey. The Druids
added fuel to the fiery energy thus excited.
There was the political organization that consolidates
kingdoms. There was the spirit of faction
which disintegrates them. As were the
Brigantes, so were the Iceni; as were the Iceni,
so were the Silures and Ordovices. The same
family likeness runs throughout; likeness in
essentials, difference in detail. In Caledonia the
hair was flaxen; in South Wales curled and
black. The complexion too was florid, from which
Tacitus has drawn certain inferences.</p>

<p>The conquests under Vespasian carry us further
still into Scotland, and to the Grampians,
against the <i>Caledonians</i> under Galgacus. The
extent to which they differed from the Britons
is not to be collected from the account of Tacitus.
We expect that they will be as brave;
but ruder. Still, the details which we get from
the life of Agricola are few. They fought from
chariots, and their swords were broad and blunt.
As the swords of the Bronze period were thin
and pointed, this is an argument in favour of
iron having become the usual material for warlike
weapons as far north as the Grampians.
The historical testimony to the inferior civilization
of the North Britons, or Caledonians, is to be
found in a later writer, Dio Cassius, in his history<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of the campaigns of Severus. "Amongst
the Britons the two greatest tribes are the Caledonians
and the M&aelig;at&aelig;; for even the names
of the others, as may be said, have merged in
these. The M&aelig;at&aelig; dwell close to the wall
which divides the island into two parts; the
Caledonians beyond them. Each of these people
inhabit mountains wild and waterless, and
plains desert and marshy, having neither walls
nor cities, nor tilth, but living by pasturage, by
the chase, and on certain berries; for of their
fish, though abundant and inexhaustible, they
never taste. They live in tents, naked and barefooted,
having wives in common, and rearing the
whole of their progeny. Their state is chiefly
democratical, and they are above all things delighted
by pillage; they fight from chariots, having
small swift horses; they fight also on foot,
are very fleet when running, and most resolute
when compelled to stand; their arms consist of
a shield and a short spear, having a brazen knob
at the extremity of a shaft, that when shaken
it may terrify the enemy by its noise; they
use daggers also; and are capable of enduring
hunger, thirst, and hardships of every description;
for when plunged in the marshes they
abide there many days, with their heads only
out of water; and in the woods they subsist on
bark and roots; they prepare, for all emergencies,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a certain kind of food, of which, if they
eat only so much as the size of a bean, they
neither hunger nor thirst. Such, then, is the
Island Britannia, and such the inhabitants of
that part of it which is hostile to us."</p>

<p>Of Ireland, we have no definite accounts till
much later, so that, with the exception of a
few details, the characteristics of the social condition
of that island must be inferred from the
analogy of Great Britain, and from the subsequent
history of the Irish. Now a rough view
of even the British characteristics is all that
has been attempted in the present chapter. No
historic events have been narrated, except so far
as they elucidate some national or local habit;
and no such habits and customs have been
noted unless they could be referred to some
particular branch of our populations; for the
object has been specification rather than generalization,
the indication of certain <i>Cornubian</i>,
<i>Kentish</i>, or <i>Caledonian</i> peculiarities rather than
of <i>British</i> ones. At the same time, the fact that
all the occupants of the British Islands are referrible
to the great Keltic stock, implies the
likelihood of these differences lying within a comparatively
small compass.</p>

<p>The step that comes next is the history of the
stock itself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p>ORIGIN OF THE BRITONS.&mdash;KELTS OF GAUL.&mdash;THE BELG&AElig;.&mdash;WHETHER
KELTIC OR GERMAN.&mdash;EVIDENCE OF C&AElig;SAR.&mdash;ATTREBATES, BELG&AElig;,
REMI, DUROTRIGES AND MORINI, CHAUCI AND MENAPII.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the two branches of the Keltic stock the
British will be considered first, and that in respect
to its origin.</p>

<p>It is rare that the population of an island is
without clear, definite, and not very distant affinities
with that of the nearest part of the nearest
continent. The Cingalese of Ceylon can be
traced to India; the Sumatrans to the Malayan
Peninsula; the Kurile Islanders to the Peninsula
of Sagal&iacute;n; the Guanches of Teneriffe to
the coast of Barbary. The nearest approach to
isolation is in the island of Madagascar, where
the affinities are with Sumatra, the Moluccas and
the Malay stock rather than with the opposite
parts of Africa, the coasts of Mozambique and
Zanguibar. But Madagascar has long been the
great ethnological mystery. Iceland, too, was
peopled from Scandinavia and not from Greenland.</p>

<p>It is in Gaul, then, that we must look for the
mother-country of Kelts; at least in the first<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
instance, for Gaul is the nearest point&mdash;the white
cliffs of Folkstone being within sight of the opposite
shore. Yet (as an example of the extent
to which one ethnological question depends upon
another) the Gallic origin of the earliest Britons
has been objected to. For a <i>Keltic</i> population,
indeed, it has been admitted to be the natural
area; but we have seen that a population other
and earlier than the Keltic has been inferred
from the shape of the skulls, and other phenomena
of the Stone period. Now for such a
population as this, Jutland or Sleswick has been
considered the more likely locality, since the
skulls in question have been compared to those
of the Laplanders and Finns; and, if this be
true, the further north we carry the home of
the British aborigines, the less we find it necessary
to bring the Finn or Lap families southward.
This reasoning is valid if the original
fact of any <i>pre</i>-Keltic population be true. Those,
however, who doubt the premises, have no need
to refine upon the current notion of Gaul being
the original home of the Britons. Gaul, then, is
the ground from which we take our view of the
great Keltic division of the human species in its
integrity; for, hitherto, we have seen but the
western offsets of it.</p>

<p>That the country between the Seine and
Garonne, corresponding with the provinces of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Normandy, Brittany, Maine, Anjou, Poitiers, the
Isle of France, and the Orleannois, was Keltic,
has never been doubted. The evidence of C&aelig;sar
is express; and there is neither objection nor
cavil to set against it. There it is, where, at
the present moment, the Keltic Breton of Brittany
continues to be the language of the common
people.</p>

<p>The central and south-eastern parts of France&mdash;the
Nivernois, Burgundy, the Bourbonnois, the
Lionnois, Auvergne, Dauphiny, Languedoc, Savoy,
and Provence&mdash;were <i>chiefly</i> Keltic. Perhaps they
were wholly so; but as the Ligurians of Italy,
and Iberians of Spain are expressly stated to
have met on the lower Rhone, it is best to
qualify this assertion. At the same time, good
reasons can be given for considering that the
Ligurians were but little different from the
other Gauls.</p>

<p>South of the Garonne the ancient population
was <i>Iberic</i>.</p>

<p>Switzerland, or the ancient Helvetia, was
Keltic, and beyond Switzerland, along the
banks of the Danube, and in the fertile plains
of Northern Italy, intrusive and conquering
Kelts were extended as far east as Styria, and
as far south as Etruria; but these were offsets
from the main body of the stock, whose true
area was Gaul and the British isles.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The parts between the Seine and Rhine, the
valleys of the Marne, the Oise, the Somme, the
Sambre, the Meuse, and the Moselle were <i>Belgic</i>.
Treves was Belgian; Luxembourg, Belgian;
the Netherlands, Belgian. Above all,
French Flanders, Artois, and Picardy&mdash;the parts
nearest Britain&mdash;the parts within sight of Kent&mdash;the
parts from whence Britain was most likely
to be peopled&mdash;were Belgian.</p>

<p>Now, as Britain was originally Keltic, unless
Belgium be Keltic also, we shall meet with a
difficulty.</p>

<p>In my own mind Belgium <i>was</i> originally Keltic;
and, perhaps, nine ethnologists out of ten
hold the same opinion. At the same time, fair
reasons can be given for an opposite doctrine,
fair reasons for believing the <i>Belg&aelig;</i> to have been
German&mdash;as German as the Angles of old, as
German as the present Germans of Germany,
as German as the Dutch of Holland, and, what
is more to the purpose, as German as the present
Flemings of Flanders, possibly occupants
of the ancient, and certainly occupants of the
modern, Belgium.</p>

<p>Upon the latter fact we must lay considerable
weight. Modern Belgium is as truly the country
of two languages and of a double population
as Wales, Ireland, or Scotland. There is the
French, which has extended itself from the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
south, and the Flemish, which belongs to Holland
and the parts northwards; a form of speech
which differs from the true Dutch less than the
Lowland Scotch does from the English, and far
less than the Dutch itself does from the German.
More than this. South of the line which separates
the French and Flemish, traces of the previous
use of the latter language are both definite
and numerous, occurring chiefly in the names of
places such as <i>Dunkirk</i>, <i>Wissant</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Now, as the French language has encroached
upon the Flemish, and the Flemish has receded
before the French, nothing is more legitimate
than the conclusion than that, at some earlier
period, the dialects of the great Germanic stock
extended as far south as the Straits of Dover;
and, if so, Germans might have found their way
into the south-eastern counties of England 2000
years ago, or even sooner. Hence, instead of the
Angles and Saxons having been the first conquerors
of the Britons, and the earlier introducers
of the English tongue, Belg&aelig; of Kent, Belg&aelig;
of Surrey, Belg&aelig; of Sussex, and Belg&aelig; of Hampshire,
may have played an important, though
unrecorded, part in that long and obscure process
which converted Keltic Britain into German
England, the land of the Welsh and Gaels into
the land of the Angles and Danes, the clansmen
of Cassibelaunus, Boadicea, Caractacus and Galgacus<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
into the subjects of Egbert, Athelstan, and
Alfred.</p>

<p>Such views have not only been maintained,
but they have been supported by important testimonies
and legitimate arguments. Foremost
amongst the former come two texts of C&aelig;sar,
one applying to the well-known Belg&aelig; of the
continent, the others to certain obscurer Belg&aelig;
of Great Britain. When C&aelig;sar inquired of the
legates of Remi, the ancient occupants, under
their ancient name, of the parts about Rheims,
what States constituted the power of the Belg&aelig;,
and what was their military power, he found
things to be as follows&mdash;"<i>The majority of the
Belg&aelig; were derived from the Germans (plerosque
Belgas ortos esse ab Germanus).</i> Having
in the olden time crossed the Rhine, they
settled in their present countries, on account of
the fruitfulness of the soil, and expelled the
Gauls, who inhabited the parts before them.
They alone, with the memory of our fathers, when
all Gaul was harassed by the Teutones and Cimbri,
forbid those enemies to pass their frontier.
On the strength of this they assumed a vast
authority in the affairs of war, and manifested a
high spirit. Their numbers were known, because,
united by relationships and affinities (<i>propinquitatibus
ad finitatibusque conjuncti</i>), it could be
ascertained what numbers each chief could bring<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with him to the common gathering for the war.
The first in numbers, valour, and influence were
the Bellovaci. These could make up as many as
100,000 fighting men. Of these they promised
40,000; for which they were to have the whole
management of the war. Their neighbours were
the Suessiones, the owners of a vast and fertile
territory. Their king Divitiacus was yet remembered
as the greatest potentate of all Gaul, whose
rule embraced a part of Britain as well. Their
present king was Gallus. Such was his justice
and prudence, that the whole conduct of the war
was voluntarily made over to him. Their cities
were twelve in number; their contingent 50,000
soldiers. The Nervii, the fiercest and most distant
of the confederacy, would send as many;
the Attrebates 15,000, the Ambiani 10,000, the
Morini 22,000, the Menapii 9,000, the Caleti
10,000, the Velocasses and Veromandui 10,000,
the Aduatici 29,000; the Condrusi, Eburones, C&aelig;rasi,
and P&aelig;mani, who were collectively called
<i>Germans</i> (<i>qui uno nomine Germani appellantur</i>)
might be laid at 40,000."&mdash;Bell. Gall., ii. 4.</p>

<p>Let us consider this as evidence (to a certain
extent) of the north of Gaul having been German,
without, at present, asking how far it is conclusive.
If we look to C&aelig;sar's description of Britain
we shall find the elements of a second proposition,
viz., that "what is true of the northern coast<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of Gaul, is true of the southern coast of Britain."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
So that if the Belg&aelig; were Germans in the time
of C&aelig;sar, the populations of Kent, Surrey, and
Sussex were German also.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar's statement is, "that the interior of Britain
is inhabited by those who are recorded to
have been born in the island itself; whereas the
sea-coast is the occupancy of immigrants from the
country of the <i>Belg&aelig;</i>, brought over for the sake
of either war or plunder. All these are called by
names nearly the same as those of the States
they came from, names which they have retained
in the country upon which they made
war, and in the land whereon they settled."&mdash;<span class="smcapl">B.
G.</span>, v. 12.</p>

<p>I submit that these two statements would give
us unexceptionable evidence in favour of the
Belg&aelig; being Germans, and the south-eastern Britons
being Belg&aelig;, in case they stood with no
conflicting assertions to set against them, and
no presumptions in favour of an opposite doctrine;
in which case the inference that Kent was
German would be irrefragable, and would stand
thus&mdash;</p>

<p>The Belg&aelig; were Germans<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The south-eastern Britons were the same class
with the Belg&aelig;&mdash;</p>

<p>Therefore they were Germans.</p>

<p>Such a syllogism, I repeat, would be in proper
form, and the inference satisfactory.</p>

<p>But there is a great deal to set against both:
so much as to make it extremely probable that
the utmost that can be got from the first statement
is, that a part of the Belg&aelig;, and more especially
the Condrusi, Eburones, C&aelig;rasi, and P&aelig;mani
were Germans only in the way that the
people of Guernsey and Jersey are English, <i>i.e.</i>,
politically but not ethnologically; and that the
second only proves that certain national names
occurred on both sides of the channel.</p>

<p>If we look at the numerous local, national, and
individual names of the Belg&aelig;, we find that they
agree so closely in form with those of the undoubted
Gauls, as to be wholly undistinguishable.
The towns end in -<i>acum</i>, -<i>briva</i>, -<i>magus</i>, -<i>dunum</i>,
and -<i>durum</i>, and begin with <i>Ver</i>-, <i>C&aelig;r</i>-, <i>Con</i>-, and
<i>Tre</i>-, just like those of Central Gallia; so that we
have&mdash;to go no farther than the common maps&mdash;Viriovi-<i>acum</i>,
Minori-<i>acum</i>, Origi-<i>acum</i>, Turn-<i>acum</i>,
Bag-<i>acum</i>, Camar-<i>acum</i>, Nemet-<i>acum</i>,
Catusi-<i>acum</i>, Gemini-<i>acum</i>, Blari-<i>acum</i>, Mederi-<i>acum</i>,
Tolbi-<i>acum</i>; Samaro-<i>briva</i>; Novio-<i>magus</i>,
Moso-<i>magus</i>; Vero-<i>dunum</i>; Marco-<i>durum</i>, Theo-<i>durum</i>;
<i>Ver</i>-omandui; <i>C&aelig;r</i>-asi; <i>Con</i>-drusi; <i>Tre</i>-viri&mdash;all<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Gallic compounds on Belgian ground,
and all forms either wholly foreign to any German
area, or else exceedingly rare. Now it is no
objection to this remarkable and exclusive preponderance
of Gallic names in Belgian geography,
to say that there is no proof of the designations
in question being native; and that, although they
existed in the language of C&aelig;sar's informants, who
were Gauls, they were strange to the Belg&aelig;, even
as the word <i>Welsh</i> is strange to a Cambro-Briton&mdash;being
the name by which he is known to an
Englishman, but not the true and native denomination.
I say that all argument of this kind,
valid as it is in so many other cases where it is
never applied, has no place here; since C&aelig;sar's
informants about the Belgic populations were the
Belg&aelig; themselves, and it is inconceivable that
they should have used nothing but Gallic terms
when they spoke of themselves, if they had not
been Gauls.</p>

<p>The names of the individual Belgic chiefs are
as Gallic as those of the towns and nations, <i>e.g.</i>,
<i>Commius</i> and <i>Divitiacus</i>, and so are those of
such Britons as <i>Cassibelaunus</i>.</p>

<p>I submit that this is, as far as it goes, a reason
for limiting rather than extending all such statements
as the ones in question. And it is by no
means a solitary one. A statement of Strabo
confirms it:&mdash;"The Aquitanians are wholly different"<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
(<i>i.e.</i>, from the other Gauls) "not only in
language, but in their bodies,&mdash;wherein they are
more like the Iberians than the Gauls. The rest
are Gallic in look; but not all alike in language.
Some differ <i>a little</i>. Their politics, too, and manners
of life differ <i>a little</i>."&mdash;Lib. iv. c. 1.</p>

<p>With the external evidence, then, of Strabo,
coinciding with the internal evidence derived
from the geographical, national, and individual
names, it seems illegitimate to infer from the text
of C&aelig;sar more than has been suggested.</p>

<p>Unless we believe the Belg&aelig; of Picardy to
have been Germans, the second fact stated by
C&aelig;sar, viz., the Belgic origin of the south-eastern
Britons is comparatively unimportant, since
it merely shews that between the Britons of
the south-eastern coast, and those of the interior,
there were certain points of difference,
the former being recent immigrants, and Belgium
being the country from which they migrated.
Nevertheless, this introduces a difficulty;
since, by drawing a distinction between
the men of Kent, and the men of the Midland
Counties, we are precluded from arguing that
the Britons in general belonged to the same
class as the Gauls; inasmuch as C&aelig;sar's description
may fairly be said to apply to the
<i>Belgic Britons only</i>.</p>

<p>I think, myself, that C&aelig;sar's statement must<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
be taken as an <i>inference</i> rather than as <i>evidence</i>;
in other words, he must not be considered to
say that certain <i>Attrebates</i> and <i>Belg&aelig;</i> crossed the
Straits of Dover and settled in Britain, but that, as
certain portions both of Belgium and Britain bore
the same names, a migration had taken place;
such being the explanation of the coincidence.
Or, if we suppose C&aelig;sar himself to have been
too acute a reasoner to confound a conclusion
with a fact (as, perhaps, he was), we may attribute
the inference to his informants. Whoever
is in the habit of sifting ethnological evidence,
is well aware that a confusion of kind in question
is one of the commonest of the difficulties he
must deal with.</p>

<p>At the same time, that there were some actual
Belg&aelig; in Britain is likely enough; but that they
were a separate substantive population, of sufficient
magnitude to be found in all the parts of
Britain where Belgic names occurred, and still
more that they were Germans, is an unsafe inference;
safe, perhaps, if the two texts of C&aelig;sar stood
alone, but unsafe, if we take into consideration
the numerous facts, statements, and presumptions
which complicate and oppose them.</p>

<p>The Belgic names themselves, which occurred
in Britain, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>Attrebates.</i>&mdash;There were Attrebates both in
Belgium and Britain; the Gaelic ones in <i>Artois</i>,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which is only <i>Attrebates</i> in a modern form. Considerable
importance attaches to the fact, that
before C&aelig;sar visited Britain in person, he sent
<i>Commius</i>, the Attrebatian, before him. Now,
this Commius was first conquered by C&aelig;sar, and
afterwards set up as a king over the Morini.
That Commius gave much of his information
about Britain to C&aelig;sar is likely; perhaps he was
his chief informant. He, too, it was who, knowing
the existence of Attrebates in Britain, probably
drew the inference which has been so
lately suggested, viz., that of a Belg&aelig; migration,
or a series of them. Yet the Attrebates of
Britain were so far from being on the coast, that
they must have lain west of London, in Berkshire
and Wilts; since C&aelig;sar, who advanced, at
least, as far as Chertsey, where he crossed the
Thames, meets nothing but Cantii, Trinobantes,
Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci and
Cassi. It is Ptolemy who first mentions the
British <i>Attrebatii</i>; and he places them between
the Dobuni and the Cantii. Now, as the Dobuni
lay due west of the Silures of South Wales, we
cannot bring the Attrebatii nearer the coast than
Windsor.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The <i>Belg&aelig;</i>.&mdash;These&mdash;like the Attrebatii,
first mentioned by Ptolemy&mdash;are placed south of
the Dobuni, and on the sea-coast between the
Cantii and Damnonii of Devonshire; so that Sussex,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Hants, and Dorset, may be given them as
their area.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>Remi</i> are mentioned by no better an
authority than Richard of Cirencester, as Bibroci
under another name.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The <i>Durotriges</i>, too, or people of <i>Dor</i>-set,
are stated by the same authority to have been
called <i>Morini</i>.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> <i>f.</i> In Ireland we have two populations with
German names; the <i>Menapii</i> and the <i>Chauci</i>,
both in the parts about Dublin, and in the neighbourhood
of one another. And these are mentioned
by Ptolemy.</p>

<p>Now, whatever these Belgic names prove, they
do not prove C&aelig;sar's statement that it was the
<i>maritime parts of Britain which were Belgic</i>;
since the Menapii and Chauci must have been
wholly unknown to him, and the <i>Attrebatii</i> lay
inland.</p>

<p>At the same time, they prove something. They
also introduce difficulties in the very simple view
that Britain was solely and exclusively British.
This leads to a further consideration of the details.
The <i>Remi</i> may be disposed of first. They
stand on bad authority, viz., that of a monk of
the twelfth century.</p>

<p>So may the <i>Morini</i>. Though I admit the ingenuity
and soundness of the doctrine that the
existence of a double nomenclature such as that<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
by which the Durotriges are called Morini, and
the Morini, Durotriges, is well explained by the
assumption of a second language, and the notion
that the inhabitants of certain districts were
sometimes called by a British, sometimes by a
German, name, the hypothesis is not valid where
the facts can be more easily explained otherwise.
No one would thus explain such words
as <i>Lowlander</i> and <i>Borderer</i> applied to the
people of the Cheviot Hills. Yet both are current;
one being given when their relation to
England, the other when their difference from
the Highland Gaels, is expressed.</p>

<p>Now, it so happens that <i>Morini</i> and <i>Durotriges</i>
are words that can as little be considered
as synonymous terms belonging to different languages
as <i>Lowlander</i> and <i>Borderer</i>; since good
reasons can be given for referring them <i>both</i> to
the Keltic. Their <i>exact</i> import is difficult to ascertain;
but if we suppose them to mean <i>coasters</i>
and <i>watersidemen</i>, respectively, we get a clear
view of the unlikelihood of one being German
and the other Keltic. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Duro-triges</i> coincides with the Latin compound
<i>ponticol&aelig;</i>, since <i>dwr</i> in Welsh, Cornish, and
Armorican means <i>water</i>, and <i>trigau</i> means <i>to
remain</i> or <i>to inhabit</i>; <i>trig-adiad</i> denoting <i>dwellers</i>,
or inhabitants, as is well remarked by Prichard,
v. iii. 128.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p><i>M&ocirc;r</i>, in <i>Morini</i>, is neither more nor less than
the Latin word <i>mare</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Surely this sets aside
all arguments drawn from the supposed bilingual
character of the words <i>Morini</i> and <i>Durotriges</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Cauci</i> and <i>Menapii</i> of Ireland tell a different<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
tale. One name without the other would
prove but little; but when we find <i>Cauci</i> in Germany
not far from <i>Menapii</i>, and <i>Menapii</i> in
Ireland not far from <i>Chauci</i>, the case becomes
strengthened. Yet the likelihood of <i>Menap</i>, being
the same word as the <i>Menai</i> of the <i>Menai Straits</i>
in Wales, suggests the probability of that word
being a geographical term. Nevertheless, the
contiguity of the two nations is an argument as
far as it goes.</p>

<p>And here I must remark, that the process by
which words originally very different may become
identified when they pass into a fresh language is
not sufficiently attended to. <i>Cauci</i> is the form
which an Irish, <i>Chauci</i> that which a German,
word takes in Latin. And the two words are
alike. Yet it is far from certain that they would
be thus similar if we knew either the Gaelic original
of one, or the German of the other. A dozen
forms exceedingly different might be excogitated,
which, provided that they all agreed in being
strange to a Roman, would, when moulded into
a Latin form, become alike. Still the argument,
as far as it goes, is valid.</p>

<p>Such are the reasons for believing, at one and
the same time, that the Britons came from Belgic
Gaul, and that the Belg&aelig; from whence they came
were Kelts.</p>

<p>We cannot, however, so far consider the origin<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the British branch of the Keltic stock to be
disposed of, as to proceed forthwith to the Gaelic;
another population requires a previous notice.
This is the Pict.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> These are the exact words of one of the ablest supporters of
the Germanic origin of the south-eastern Britons, Mr. E. Adams,
in a paper entitled, "Remarks on the probability of Gothic Settlements

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This root is important. As it means <i>sea</i> in more European
languages than one, it has created a philological difficulty in the
case of a very interesting gloss, <i>Mori-marusa</i>, meaning <i>dead sea</i>;
where by a strange coincidence the same consonants (<i>m-r</i>) are
repeated, but with a difference of meaning.
</p><p>
Prichard, who drew attention to this remarkable compound,
having stated that a passage in Pliny informed us that the <i>Cimbri</i>
called the sea in their neighbourhood <i>Mori-marusa</i>, inferred
that the name was Cimbric; and further argued, that as <i>mor
mawth</i> in Welsh meant the same, the Cimbric tongue was Welsh,
Cambrian, or British. As far as it went the inference was truly
legitimate; but the reasoning which led to it was deficient. The
likelihood of there being more languages than one wherein both
<i>mor</i> meant <i>sea</i>, and <i>mor</i> meant <i>dead</i>, was overlooked; though
one of the languages that supplied the coincidence was the
Latin&mdash;<i>mare mort-uum</i>.
</p><p>
Another such a tongue was the Slavonic; and to that tongue
I imagine <i>Morimarusa</i> to be referrible. I also imagine that by
the <i>Cimbri</i> of Pliny were meant the <i>Cimmerii</i>; so that the
Sea of Azof was the true Dead Sea; or, perhaps, the Propontis;
in which case its present name, the <i>Sea of Marmora</i>, is explained.
</p><p>
The name of the Province, <i>Ar-mor-ica</i>, means the <i>country on
the sea</i>, and if rendered in Latin would be <i>ad mare</i>. <i>Ar-gail</i> is
such another word; and it was the name of the landing-place of
the <i>Gael</i>=<i>ad Gallos</i>.
</p><p>
To the Gaelic <i>Ar-mor-ica</i>, the Slavonians have an exact parallel
in the word <i>Po-mor-ania</i>; where <i>po</i> means <i>on</i>, and <i>mor</i>
the <i>sea</i>.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p>THE PICTS.&mdash;LIST OF KINGS.&mdash;PENN FAHEL.&mdash;ABER AND INVER.&mdash;THE
PICTS PROBABLY, BUT NOT CERTAINLY, BRITONS.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Picts have never been considered Romans;
but, with that exception, a relationship with
every population of the British Isles has been
claimed for them. As Germans on the strength
of Tacitus' description of their physical conformation
of the Caledonian, and as Germans on the
strength of the supposed Germanic origin of the
Belg&aelig;, the Picts have been held the ancestors of
the present Lowland Scotch. They have been
considered Scandinavians also. On the other
hand, they have been made Gaels, in which case
it is the Highlanders who are their offspring.
They have been considered Britons, and they
have been considered a separate stock.</p>

<p>That they were Kelts rather than Germans is
the commonest doctrine, and that they were
Britons rather than Gaels is a common one;
the arguments that prove the latter proving
the first <i>a fortiori</i>.</p>

<p>We approach the subject with a notice of the
Irish missionary St. Columbanus, whose native
tongue was, of course, the Irish Gaelic. This was<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
unintelligible to the Northern Picts, as is expressly
stated on in Adammanus:&mdash;"Alio in tempore
quo Sanctus Columba in Pictorum provincia
per aliquot demorabatur dies, quidam cum tota
plebeius familia, verbum <i>vit&aelig;</i> per interpretatorem,
<i>Sancto pr&aelig;dicante viro</i>, audiens credidit, credensque
baptizatus est."&mdash;<i>Adamn. ap. Colganum.</i> l. ii.
c. 32.</p>

<p>This, however, only shews that the Pict was
not exactly and absolutely Irish. It might have
approached it. It might also be far more unlike
than the Welsh was.</p>

<p>A document known as the Colbertine MS.,
from being published from the Colbertine Library,
contains a list of Pictish kings. This has
been analysed by Innes and Garnett; and the
result is, that two names only are more Gaelic
in their form than Welsh&mdash;viz., <i>Cineod</i> or <i>Kenneth</i>,
and <i>Domhnall</i> or <i>Donnell</i>. The rest are
either absolutely contrary to what they would
be if they were Gaelic, or else British rather than
aught else. Thus, the Welsh <i>Gurgust</i> appears in
the Irish Annal as <i>Fergus</i>, or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Now
the Pict form of this name is <i>Wrgwst</i>, with a
final <span class="smcapl">T</span>, and without an initial <span class="smcapl">F</span>. <i>Elpin</i>, <i>Drust</i>,
<i>Drostan</i>, <i>Wrad</i>, and <i>Necton</i> are close and undoubted
Pict equivalents to the Welsh names
<i>Owen</i>, <i>Trwst</i>, <i>Trwstan</i> (<i>Tristram</i>), <i>Gwriad</i>, and
<i>Nwython</i>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The readers of the Antiquary well know the
prominence given to the only two common terms
of the Pict language in existence <i>pen val</i>, or as it
appears in the oldest MSS. of Beda <i>peann fahel</i>.
This is the <i>head of the wall</i>, or <i>caput vall</i>, being
the eastern extremity (there or thereabouts) of
the Vallum of Antoninus. Now the present Welsh
form for <i>head</i> is <i>pen</i>; the Gaelic <i>cean</i>. Which
way the likeness lies here, is evident. For the
<i>fahel</i> (or <i>val</i>) the case is less clear. The Gaelic
form is <i>fhail</i>, the Welsh <i>gwall</i>; the Gaelic being
the nearest.</p>

<p>But some collateral evidence on this subject
more than meets the difficulty. "In the Durham
MSS. of Nennius, apparently written in the
twelfth century, there is an interpolated passage,
stating that the spot in question was in the Scottish
or Gaelic language called <i>Cenail</i>. Innes and
others have remarked the resemblance between
this appellation and the present Kinneil; but no
one appears to have noticed that <i>Cenail</i> accurately
represents the <i>pronunciation</i> of the Gaelic
<i>cean fhail</i>, literally <i>head of wall</i>, <i>f</i> being quiescent
in construction. A remarkable instance of
the same suppression occurs in <i>Athole</i>, as now
written, compared with the <i>Ath-fothla</i> of the Irish
annalists. Supposing, then, that <i>Cenail</i> was substituted
for <i>peann fahel</i> by the Gaelic conquerors
of the district, it would follow that the older appellation<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
was <i>not</i> Gaelic, and the inference would
be obvious."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In thus making <i>pen val</i> a Pict gloss, I by no
means imagine that any of the three forms were
originally Keltic at all; since <i>val</i>, <i>gwal</i>, <i>fhail</i> all
seem variations of the Roman <i>vallum</i>, at least, in
respect to their immediate origin. Still, if out
of three languages, adopting the same word, each
gives a different form, the variation which results
is as much a gloss of the tongue wherein it occurs,
as if the word were indigenous. Hence,
whether we say that <i>pen val</i> are Pict glosses, or
that <i>pen</i> is a Pict <i>gloss</i>, and <i>val</i> a Pict <i>form</i> is a
matter of practical indifference.</p>

<p>The <i>Vallum Antonini</i> was a work of man's
hands, and its name is of less value than those
of natural objects, such as <i>mountains</i>, <i>rivers</i>, or
<i>lakes</i>. Nevertheless, these latter have been examined:
thus the <i>Ochel</i> Hills in Perthshire are
better explained by the Welsh form <i>uchel</i> than
by the Gaelic <i>nasal</i>. But the most important
word of all is the first element of the words <i>Aber</i>-nethy,
and <i>Inver</i>-nethy. Both mean the same,
<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>confluence of waters</i>, or something very
much of the sort. Both enter freely into composition,
and the compounds thus formed are found
over the greater part of the British Isles as the
names of the mouths of the larger and more important<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
rivers. But it is only a few districts
where the two names occur together. Just as we
expect <i>a priori</i> <i>aber</i> occurs when <i>inver</i> is not
to be found, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Of the two extremes
Ireland is the area where <i>aber</i>, Wales where <i>inver</i>
is the rarer of the two forms; indeed so rare
are they that the one (<i>aber</i>) rarely, if ever, occurs
in Ireland, the other (<i>inver</i>) rarely, if ever, in
Wales. Now as Ireland is Gaelic, and Welsh
British, the two words may fairly be considered to
indicate, where they occur, the presence of these
two different tongues respectively.</p>

<p>The distribution of the words in question has
long been an instrument of criticism in determining
both the ethnological position of the Pict
nation, and its territorial extent; and the details
are well given in the following table of Mr.

Argyle, trending to the N.E. along the present boundary between
Perth and Inverness, Aberdeen and Inverness, Banf and Elgin,

<p>It cannot be denied that, in the present state

two-thirds of Scotland exhibit signs of <i>British</i>
rather than <i>Gaelic</i> occupancy.</p>

<p>This is as much as can be said at present: for
it must be added that all the previous criticism
has proceeded upon the notion that <span class="smcapl">PENN FAHEL</span>,
&amp;c., are Pict words. What, however, if they be
Pict only in the way that <i>man</i>, <i>woman</i>, &amp;c., are
Welsh; <i>i.e.</i>, words used by a population within
the Pict area, but not actually Pict? The refinement
upon the opinion suggested by the present
chapter, which arises out of the view, will be noticed
after certain other questions have been
dealt with.</p>

<div class="bk1"><p>ORIGIN OF THE GAELS.&mdash;DIFFICULTIES OF ITS INVESTIGATION.&mdash;NOT

FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BRITISH
AND GAELIC LANGUAGES.&mdash;THE BRITISH LANGUAGE SPOKEN IN

HYPOTHESIS.&mdash;THE CALEDONIAN HYPOTHESIS.&mdash;POSTULATES.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> origin of the Britons has been a question
of no great difficulty. They could not well have
come from the west, because Britain lies almost
on the extremity of the ancient world; so we look
towards the continent of Europe, and find, exactly
opposite to the Britons, the Gauls, speaking
a mutually intelligible language. On this we
rest, just pausing for a short time to dispose of
one or two refinements on the natural inference.</p>

<p>But if no such language as that of the ancient
Gauls, a language <i>closely</i> akin to the British, had
been discovered, the ethnologist would have been
put to straits; indeed, he would have had to be
satisfied with saying that Gaul was the likeliest
part of Europe for the Britons to have come from.
No more. A strong presumption is all he would
have obtained. The similarity, however, of the
languages has helped him.</p>

<p>Now the difficulty which has just been noticed<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
as a possible one in the investigation of the origin
of the Britons, is a real one in the case of the
Gaels. The exact parallel to the Gaelic language
cannot be found on any part of the continent.
Hence, whilst the British branch of the Keltic
is found in both England and Gaul,&mdash;on the continent
as well as in the Islands,&mdash;the Gaelic is
limited to the British Isles exclusively. Neither
in Gaul itself, nor the parts either north or south
of Gaul can any member of the Gaelic branch be
found.</p>

<p>Even within the British Islands the Gaelic is
limited in its distribution. There is no British in
Ireland, and no Gaelic in South Britain. In Scotland
both the tongues occur, the Gaelic being
spoken north of the British. Now this position of
the Gaelic to the west and north of the British
increases the difficulty&mdash;since it is cut off from all
connexion with the continent, and unrepresented
by any continental tongue.</p>

<p>The history, then, of the Gaels is that of an
isolated branch of the Keltic stock; and it is
this isolation which creates the difficulties of their
ethnology. No historical records throw any
light upon their origin&mdash;a statement which the
most sanguine investigator must admit. But
tradition, perhaps, is less uncommunicative. Many
investigators believe this. For my own part I
should only be glad to be able to do so. As<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
it is, however, the arguments of the present
chapter will proceed as if the whole legendary
history of Ireland and Scotland, so far as it relates
to the migrations by which the islands
were originally peopled by the Gaels, were a
blank&mdash;the reasons for the scepticism being withheld
for the present. But only for the present.
In the seventh chapter they will be given as
fully as space allows.</p>

<p>The present arguments rest wholly upon a fact
of which the importance has more than once been
foreshadowed already, and which the reader anticipates.
Let us say, for the sake of illustration,
that the British and Gaelic differ from each other
as the Latin and Greek. The parallel is a rough
one, but it will suffice as the basis of some criticism.</p>

<p>Languages thus related cannot be in the relation
of mother and daughter, <i>i.e.</i>, the one cannot
be derived from the other, as the English is from
the Anglo-Saxon, or the Italian from the Latin.
The true connexion is different. It is that of
brother and sister, rather than of parent and
child. The actual source is some common mother-tongue;
a mother-tongue which may become extinct
after the evolution of its progeny. Hence,
in the particular case before us, the Gaelic and
British must have developed themselves, each
independently of the other, out of some common<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
form of speech. And the development
must have taken place within the British Islands;
the doctrine being that out of a language
which at some remote period was neither
British nor Gaelic, but which contained the
germs of both, the western form of speech took
one form, the southern another&mdash;the results being
in the one case the British, in the other the
Gaelic, tongue.</p>

<p>But that common mother-tongue at the remote
period in question, the period of the earliest
occupancy of Britain, must have been spoken on
both sides of the Channel&mdash;in Gaul as well as the
British Islands. And here (<i>i.e.</i>, in Gaul) it may
have done one of two things. It may have remained
unaltered; or, it may have undergone
change. Now in either case it would be different
from both the Gaelic and the British. In the
former alternative it would have been stereotyped
as it were, and so have preserved its original
characters, whilst the Gaelic and British had
adopted new ones. In the latter it would have
altered itself after its own peculiar fashion; and
those very peculiarities would have made it other
than British as well as other than Gaelic. Yet
what is the fact? The ancient language of Gaul,
though as unlike the Gaelic as a separate and
independent development was likely to make it,
was <i>not</i> unlike the British. On the contrary,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
it was sufficiently like it to be intelligible to a
Briton. Now I hold this similarity to be conclusive
against the doctrine that the British and
Gaelic languages were developed out of some common
mother-tongue <i>within the British Islands</i>.
Had they been so the dialects of Gaul would have
been far more unlike the British than they were.</p>

<p>The <i>British</i> then, at least, did not acquire its
British character in Britain, but on the continent;
and it was introduced into England as a language
previously formed in Gaul.</p>

<p>For the Gaelic there is no such necessity for a
continental origin; indeed at the first view, the
probabilities are in favour of its having originated
in Britain. It cannot be found on the continent;
and, such being the case, its continental
origin is hypothetical. One thing, however, is
certain, viz., that if the Gaelic were once the only
language of the British Isles, the conquests and
encroachments of the Britons who displaced it,
must have been enormous. In the whole of South
Britain it must certainly have been superseded,
and in half Scotland as well: whilst, if, before
its introduction into Great Britain, it were spoken
on any part of the continent, the displacement
must have been greater still.</p>

<p>Now, the hypothesis as to the origin of the
Gaels may take numerous forms. I indicate
the following three.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The first may be called <i>Lhuyd's</i> doctrine,
since Humphrey Lhuyd, one of the best of our
earlier arch&aelig;ologists, suggested it. Mr. Garnett
has spoken of it with respect; but he evidently
hesitates to admit it. And it is only with
respect that it should be mentioned; for, it is
highly probable. It makes the original population
of all the British Isles&mdash;England as well
as Scotland and Ireland&mdash;to have been Gaelic,
Gaelic to the exclusion of any Britons whatever.
It makes a considerable part of the continent
Gaelic as well. In consequence of this,
the Britons are a later and intrusive population,
a population which effected a great and complete
displacement of the earlier Gaels over the whole
of South Britain, and the southern part of Scotland.
Except that they were a branch of the
same stock as the Gaels, their relation to the
aborigines was that of the Anglo-Saxons to
themselves at a later period. The Gaels first;
then the Britons; lastly the Angles. Such is the
sequence. The general distribution of these two
branches of the Keltic stock leads to Lhuyd's
hypothesis; in other words, the presumptions
are in its favour. But this is not all. There
are certainly some words&mdash;the names, of course,
of geographical objects&mdash;to be found in both England
and Gaul, which are better explained by
the Gaelic than the British language. The most<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
notable of these is the names of such rivers as
the <i>Exe</i>, <i>Axe</i>, and (perhaps) <i>Ouse</i>, which is better
illustrated by the Irish term <i>uisge</i> (<i>whiskey</i>,
<i>water</i>), than by any Welsh or Armorican one.</p>

<p>2. The second doctrine may be called the
<i>Hibernian</i> hypothesis. It allows to the Britons
of England, and South Scotland any amount of
antiquity, making them aboriginal to Great Britain.
The Gaels of the Scottish Highlands it
derives from Ireland; a view supported by a
passage in Beda.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Ireland is thus the earliest
insular occupancy of the Gael. But whence
came they to Ireland? From some part south
and west of the oldest known south-western
limits of the Keltic area, from Spain, perhaps;
in which case a subsequent displacement of the
original Kelts of the continent by the Iberians&mdash;the
oldest known stock of the Peninsula&mdash;must
be assumed. But as there must be some assumptions
somewhere, the only question is as to its
legitimacy.</p>

<p>3. The third hypothesis&mdash;the <i>Caledonian</i>&mdash;reverses
the second, and deduces the Irish Gaels
from Scotland, and the Scotch Gaels from some
part <i>north</i> of the oldest known Keltic boundary
and in the direction of Scandinavia. Like
both the others, this involves a subsequent displacement
of the mother-stock.</p>

ADRIAN, ANTONINUS, AND SEVERUS.&mdash;BONOSUS.&mdash;CARAUSIUS.&mdash;THE
CONSTANTIAN FAMILY.&mdash;FRANKS AND ALEMANNI IN BRITAIN.&mdash;FOREIGN
ELEMENTS IN THE ROMAN LEGIONS.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> steady and continuous operation of Roman
influences may be said to begin in the reign of
Claudius, <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 43; the sceptre of Cynobelin having
passed into the hands of his sons. Against
these, and against the other princes of Britain,
such as Caradoc (Caractacus) and Cartismandua,
the active commanders Aulus Plautius and Ostorius
Scapula are employed. Three lines diverging
from the parts about London give us the direction
of their conquests. One running along the valley
of the Thames takes us to the Dobuni of Gloucestershire,
and the Silures of South Wales; both of
which are specially enumerated as subdued populations.
The other, almost at right angles with the
last, gives us the operations against the town of
Camelodunum in Essex, the Iceni who afterwards
revolted, and the Brigantes of Yorkshire. The
third is indicated by Paulinus' campaigns in
North Wales, and his bloody deeds in the Isle
of Anglesey, a line of conquest which probably
arose out of the reduction of the midland counties<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of Northampton, Leicester, Derby, Stafford,
and Shropshire. I do not say that these give us
the actual movements of the Roman army. They
serve, however, to note the points where the
special evidence of Roman occupation is most
definite.</p>

<p>In the reign of Vespasian the conquests were
not only consolidated but extended. Agricola
builds his line of forts from the Forth to the Clyde,
and penetrates as far north as the Grampians.
Whether the warriors whom he here met under
Galgacus were Britons, like those whom he had
seen in the south, or Gaels, is a matter which will
be considered hereafter; but he fought against
them with foreign as well as with Roman soldiers.
The German Usipii formed one, if not more, of his
cohorts; a circumstance which shews what will be
illustrated, with fuller details, in the sequel, viz.,
that the Roman conquerors of Britain were far
from being exclusively Roman. The Usipii, however,
are the first non-Roman soldiers mentioned
by name. On the west coast of Britain, Agricola
had to deal with the pirates from Ireland&mdash;undoubted
Gaels whatever the warriors of the
Grampians may have been.</p>

<p>Roman civilization took root rapidly in Britain,
though in a bad form. The early existence of
lawyers and money-lenders shew this. During the
reign of Domitian the advocates of Britain were<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
known to the satirists of Rome; and, as early as
that of Nero, the calling-in of a loan by the philosopher
Seneca helped to create the great revolt
under Boadicea. But except in respect to the use
of the Roman language, it is doubtful whether
the culture was much different from that which
had developed itself under Cynobelin&mdash;a civilization
which though being due, in a great
degree, to Gaul, was also, more or less indirectly,
Roman as well; but, nevertheless, a civilization
which was unattended with any loss of nationality.</p>

<p>The rampart from the mouth of the Tyne to
the Solway is referred to the reign of Adrian;
the conversion of Agricola's line of forts into a
continuous wall to that of Aurelius Antoninus.
These boundaries give us two areas. North of
the Antonine frontier the Roman power was
never consolidated, although the eastern half
was occasionally traversed by active commanders
like the Emperor Severus. It was the
county of the Caledonians and M&aelig;at&aelig;.</p>

<p>Between the frontier of Agricola and the rampart
of Adrian, the occupation was less incomplete.
Incomplete, however, it was; even when,
in the fourth century, it was made a province by
Theodosius, and in honour of the Emperor of
Valens, called Valentia. <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 211, Severus, after
strengthening the Antonine fortifications, dies at<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
York; his reign being an epoch of some importance
in the history of Roman Britain. In the
first place, it is only up to this reign that our
authorities are at all satisfactory. C&aelig;sar, Tacitus,
and Dio Cassius, have hitherto been our
guides. For the next eighty years, however,
we shall find no cotemporary historian at all,
and when our authorities begin again, the first
will be one of the worthless writers of the Panegyrics.
In the next place, the great divisions of
the Britannic populations have hitherto been but
two&mdash;the Britons proper and the Caledonians.
The next class of writers will complicate the
ethnology by speaking of the Picts. The chief
change, however, is that in the British population
itself. The contest, except on the Welsh
and Scotch frontiers, is no longer between the
Roman invader and the British native; but between
Britain as a Romano-Britannic province,
and Rome as the centre and head of the empire:
in other words, the quarrels with the mother-country
replace the wars against the aborigines.
This, however, is part of the civil history of
Rome, rather than the natural history of Britain.
The contests of Albinus against Severus, and of
Proculus and Bonosus against Probus, are the
earliest instances of the attempts upon the Imperial
Purple from these quarters; attempts
which give us the measure of the extent to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
which the island was Roman rather than Keltic&mdash;at
least in respect to its political history.</p>

<p>Bonosus, himself, had British blood in his veins
although born in Spain, for his mother was a
Gaul; but as he is called "Briton in origin," we
may infer that his father was from our own
island. Probus allowed the Britons the privilege
of <i>growing vines and of making wine</i>.</p>

<p>In the last ten years of the third century
events thicken. The revolt of Carausius, the
assumption of the empire by Allectus, and the
adoption of Constantius Chlorus by Diocletian
as C&aelig;sar, are events of ethnological as well as
political influence. This they are, because they
indicate either the introduction of foreign elements
into Britain, or the infusion of British
blood in other quarters. Carausius, for instance,
was a Menapian, and he is not likely
to have been the only one of his times. The
Constantian family, I believe, to have been
more British than even the usual opinion makes
them.</p>

<p>A little consideration will tell us that the
three names of this important pedigree&mdash;Constans,
Constantius, and Constantinus, have no
etymological connexion with the substantive
<i>Constantia</i>; in other words, that <i>Constans</i> does
not mean the <i>constant Man</i>, just as <i>prudens</i>
means the <i>prudent</i>, or <i>sapiens</i> the <i>wise</i>. No<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
such signification will account for the forms
in -<i>ius</i> and -<i>inus</i>. To this it may be added that
the family was of foreign extraction, as were the
families of nearly half the later emperors. The
name, I believe, was foreign also. If so, it was
most probably Keltic; since <i>con</i>, both as a simple
single term, and as an element of compounds is
a common Keltic proper name. The only fact
against this view is the descent of the first of
the three emperors&mdash;Constantius. He was not
born in either Gaul or Britain. On the contrary,
his father was a high official in the Diocese of
Illyricum, and his mother, a niece of the Emperor
Claudius;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> circumstances which, at the first view,
seem to contradict the inference from the name.
They do so, however, in appearance only. The
most unlikely man to have been high in office
in Illyricum was a native Illyrian; for it was
the policy of Rome to put Kelts in the Slavonic,
and Slavonians in the Keltic, provinces; just as,
at the present moment, Russia places Finn regiments
in the Caucasus, and Caucasian in Finland.
If this view be correct, a Keltic name is
evidence, as far as it goes, of Keltic blood.</p>

<p>In the next generation we have to deal with
both historical facts and traditions connected
with the pedigree of Constantine the Great.
That he was born in Britain, and that his<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
mother was of low origin, are the historical
facts; that she was the daughter of King Coel
of Colchester is the tradition. The latter is of
any amount of worthlessness, and no stress is
laid upon it. The former are considered confirmatory
of the present view. The chief support,
however, lies in the British character of the
name.</p>

<p>In the Panegyric of Mamertinus on the Emperor
Maximian, one of the Augusti, who shared
the imperial power with Diocletian, we have the
first mention of the Picts. Worthless as the Panegyrists
are when we want specific facts, they
have the great merit of being cotemporary to the
events they allude to; for allusions of a tantalizing
and unsatisfactory character is all we get
from them. However, Mamertinus is the first
writer who mentions the Picts, and he does it in
his notice of the revolt of Carausius.</p>

<p>More important than this is a passage which
gives us an army of Frank mercenaries in the
City of London, as early as <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 290&mdash;there or
thereabouts. It is a passage of which too little
notice has, hitherto, been taken&mdash;"By so thorough
a consent of the Immortal Gods, O unconquered
C&aelig;sar, has the extermination of all the enemies,
whom you have attacked, <i>and of the Franks
more especially</i>, been decreed, that even those of
your soldiers, who, having missed their way on a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
foggy sea, reached the town of London, destroyed
promiscuously and throughout the city the whole
remains of that mercenary multitude of barbarians,
that, after escaping the battle, sacking the
town, and, attempting flight, was still left&mdash;a
deed, whereby your provincials were not only
saved, but delighted by the sight of the slaughter."</p>

<p>One German tribe, then at least, has set its
foot on the land of Britain as early as the reign
of Diocletian; and that as enemies. How far
their settlement was permanent, and how far the
particular section of them, mentioned by Mamertinus,
represented the whole of the invasion, is
uncertain. The paramount fact is the existence
of hostile Franks in Middlesex nearly 200 years
before the epoch of Hengist.</p>

<p>Were there Saxons as well? This is a question
for the sequel. At present, I remark, that Mamertinus
mentions them by name but without
placing them on the soil of Britain. They merely
vexed the British Seas.</p>

<p>Were there any other Germans? Aurelius Victor
suggests that there were. <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 306, Constantius
dies at York, and Constantine, his son, "assisted
by all who were about, but especially by
Eroc, King of the Alemanni, assumes the empire."
Now Eroc had accompanied Constantius as an
ally (<i>auxilii gratii</i>); so that there were Alemanni<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
in Yorkshire, as well as Franks in Middlesex,
with powers, more or less, approaching
those of independent populations; at any rate, in
a different position from the mere legionary
Germans, of whom further notice will soon be
taken.</p>

<p>In Julian's reign the Picts, Scots, and Attacotti
harass the South Britons. This is on the cotemporary
and unexceptionable evidence of Ammianus
Marcellinus. And the same cotemporary
and unexceptionable evidence adds the <i>Saxons</i> to
his list of devastators&mdash;"Picti, <i>Saxonesque</i>, et
Scoti, et Attacotti Britannos &aelig;rumnis vexavere
continuis." Mark the word <i>continuis</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Alemanni</i> of Britain are noticed by the
same writer in a passage which must be taken
along with the notice of the Alemanni under Eroc.
"Valentinian placed Fraomarius as king over the
Buccinobantes, a nation of the Alemanni, near
Mentz. Soon afterwards, however, an attack
upon his people devastated their country (<i>pa-</i> <i>gum</i>,
<i>gau</i>). He was then translated to Britain,
and placed over the Alemanni, <i>at that time
flourishing both in numbers and power</i>, as
tribune."</p>

<p>We may now ask what foreign elements were
introduced into Britain by the Roman legions;
since nothing is more certain than that the Roman
armies consisted, but in a small degree, of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Romans. The Notitia<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Utriusque Imperii helps
us here; indeed it may be that it supplies us with
a complete list of the imperial forces in all their
ethnological heterogeneousness. Some of the
titles of the regiments and companies (<i>al&aelig;</i>, <i>numeri</i>,
<i>cohortes</i>) are unexplained: several, however,
are taken from the country of the soldiers
that composed them.</p>

<p>The list gives us settlers in Britain of Germanic,
Gallic, Iberic, Slavonic, Aramaic, and
Berber extraction.</p>

<p><i>Nervii.</i>&mdash;A cohort at Aliona.</p>

<p><i>Nervii.</i>&mdash;A cohort at Virosidum. How far these
were Gauls, or, if Gauls, of unmixed blood, is uncertain.
During the wars of C&aelig;sar, the brave
nation of the Nervians was said to have been exterminated.
Such was not the case. Portions of
it remained. At the same time, the reduction was
so great, and the subsequent influx of Germans
from the Lower Rhine was so considerable, that
the soldiers in question were, probably, as much
Roman and German as Gallic.</p>

<p>If we ask what proportion these foreign and
miscellaneous elements in the Roman Legions
of Britain bore to the true Romans, we wait in
vain for an answer. This is because the constitution
of the other portions of the army is
unknown. Who (for instance) composed the
<i>Fortenses</i>, the <i>Stablesiani</i>, the <i>Abulci</i>, and numerous
other companies? Perhaps, Romans; in
which case the proportion of Syrian, Slavonian,
and other non-Roman elements is diminished.
Perhaps, Syrians, Slavonians, or Germans; in
which case it is increased. That the above-named
troops, however, belonged to the ethnological divisions
which are denoted by the names, is in the
highest degree probable. It is also probable that
the list may be increased; thus the <i>Pacenses</i>,
the <i>Asti</i>, the <i>Frixagori</i>, and the <i>Lergi</i>, although
there are doubts, in every case, about the reading,
and still greater about the signification, have
reasonably been thought to have been regiments,
or companies, named from the localities where
they were levied; but, as already stated, these
localities are doubtful.</p>

<p>As blood foreign to both the British and Roman
was introduced into Britain, so was British<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
blood introduced elsewhere. All the foreign
stations of the British troops are not known;
but that there was, at least, one in each of the
following countries is certain&mdash;Illyricum, Egypt,
Northern Africa. The history of foreign blood
in Britain, and of British blood in foreign countries
are counterpart questions.</p>

<p>The lines of Roman road are the best <i>data</i> for
ascertaining the parts of our island where the
mixture of Roman and foreign blood was greatest:
since it is a fair inference that those districts
which were the least accessible were the most
Keltic. These are North Wales, Cornwall and
Devonshire, the Wealds of Sussex and Kent, Lincolnshire,
and the district of Craven. On the
other hand, the pre-eminently Roman tracts
are&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The valleys of the Tyne and Solway, or the
line of the wall and rampart which divided South
Britain from North.</p>

<p>2. The valley of the Ouse, or the parts about
York.</p>

<p>3, 4. The valleys of the Thames and Severn.</p>

<p>5. Cheshire and South Lancashire.</p>

<p>6. Norfolk and Suffolk.</p>

<p>The Roman blood, then, in Britain seems to
have been inconsiderable, even when we class as
Roman everything which was other than British.
That the language, however, was chiefly Latin&mdash;more<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
or less modified&mdash;is what we infer from the
analogies of Gaul and Spain. The history, too,
of four centuries of civilization and corruption is
Roman also. That there was a bodily evacuation
of Britain by the Romans, a concealment of treasures,
and a migration to Gaul, rests upon no
authority earlier than that of the Anglo-Saxon
writers, some five centuries later. The country was
rather a theatre for usurpers and rebels; none of
whom can be shewed to have either left the
island, or to have been exterminated by the
Anglo-Saxon invasion&mdash;an invasion to which, in
a future chapter, an earlier date, and a more gradual
operation than is usually assigned will be
attributed.</p>

ACCOUNTS OF THE FIFTH AND SIXTH CENTURIES.&mdash;QUESTIONS
TO WHICH THEY APPLY.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> one word has hitherto been said about the
early traditions of either Briton or Gael. No
word, either, about their early records. Nothing
about the Triads, Aneurin, Taliessin, Llywarch
Hen, and Merlin on the side of the Welsh; nothing
about the Milesian and other legends of the
Irish. Why this silence? Have the preceding
investigations been so superabundantly clear as
to lead us to dispense with all rays of light except
those of the most unexceptionable kind?</p>

<p>It is an unusual piece of good fortune when
this happens anywhere; and assuredly it has not
happened on British or Irish ground as yet. Or has
the evidence of such early records and traditions
been incompatible with the doctrines of the previous
chapters, and, on the strength of its inconvenience,
been kept back? If so, there has been a
foul piece of disingenuousness on the part of the
writer. But he does not plead guilty to this. He<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
attaches but little weight to the evidence of the
early British records; and the contents of the
present chapter are intended to justify his depreciation
of them.</p>

<p>The writer who asserts that the oldest work in
any language is of such antiquity as to be separated
from the next oldest by any very long interval&mdash;by
an interval which leaves a wide chasm
between the first and second specimens of the
literature which no fragments and no traces of
any lost compositions are found to fill up&mdash;makes
an assertion which he is bound to support by
evidence of the most cogent kind. For it is not
always enough to shew that no intrinsic objections
lie against the antiquity of the work in
question. It may be so short, or so general in
respect to its subject as to leave no room for contradictory
and impossible sentences or expressions.
It is not enough to shew that there were
no reasons against such a literature being developed;
since it is difficult to say what conditions
absolutely forbid the production of a work
stamped by no very definite characteristics. Nor
yet will it suffice to say that the preservation of
such a work is probable. All that can be got
from all this is a presumption in its favour. The
great fact of a work existing without giving this
impulse to the production of others like it, and
the fact of the same means of preservation being<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
wholly neglected in other instances, still stand
over. They are not conclusive against certain
positions; but they are circumstances which must
be fairly met; circumstances which if one writer
overlook, others will not; circumstances which
the critic will insist on; and circumstances
which, if the dazzle of a paradox, or the appeal to
the innate and universal sympathy for antiquity
keep them in the background for a while, will,
sooner or later, rise against the author who overlooked
them.</p>

<p>Neither are arguments from the antiquity of
language conclusive. When two works differ
from each other in respect to the signs of antiquity
exhibited in their phraseology, the inference
that the oldest in point of speech is <i>proportionably</i>
old in point of time is not the only one.
It is an easy thing to say that in the Latin literature
the language of Ennius represents a date
a hundred years earlier than that of Cicero, and
that of Cicero a date 400 earlier than the time of
Boethius, and that when we meet elsewhere compositions
which differ from each other as the
Latin of Ennius does from that of Boethius, there
is 500 years difference between them. It is by
no means certain that any two languages alter
at the same rate.</p>

<p>But an average may be struck, and it may be
said that greater antiquity of expression is <i>prim&acirc;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
facie</i> evidence of a greater antiquity of date. It
is: but is only so when we are quite sure that
the <i>dialects</i> of the two specimens are the same.
There are works printed this very year in Iceland
which, if their dates were unknown, would
pass for being a hundred years older than the
Swedish of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>It is only when the supporter of the authenticity
of a work of singular and unique antiquity
can begin with an epoch of comparatively recent
date, and argue backwards through a series of
continuous works, each older than the other, to
one still older than any, that he can reasonably
accuse the critic who demurs to his deductions
of captiousness. In this way the antiquity of
the oldest Chinese annals is invalidated: in this
way the date of the Indian Vedas (1400 <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>).
But the great classical literatures stand the test,
and from the present time to Claudian, from
Claudian to Ennius, and from Ennius to Archilochus
we trace a classical literature with
all its works in continuity; each pointing to
some one older than itself. Even this forbids
an excessive antiquity to Homer.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;the likelihood of forgery must be continually
kept in mind; so much so, that even in
the unexceptionable literature of the classics, if
it could be shewn that any age between the present
and the eighth century <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>, were an age in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
which the Greek drama, the Greek epics, the Greek
histories, or the Greek orations could be forged,
a great deal would be subtracted from the proofs
of their antiquity. I do not say that it would
set them aside; because everything of this kind is
a question of degree; but the argument in their
favour would be less exceptionable than it is.</p>

<p>For it cannot be too strongly urged that the
preservation of records of high antiquity, in and
of itself, is naturally and essentially improbable.
More than half of the antiquities of the world
have been lost; and this alone gives us the odds
against an instance of survivorship. This has
been insisted on by more than one arch&aelig;ologist&mdash;more
cautious and candid than the majority
of his brotherhood. Whoever doubts this should
look around him. How few nations have a literature!
How thoroughly is the non-development
of a permanent literature the exception rather
than the rule! And, even when records come
into existence, how numerous are the chances
against their preservation. Destruction is the
common law: continuance a happy rarity. For
extraordinary phenomena we must have extraordinary
proofs.</p>

<p>From the present time to the eleventh century
we may trace the native Welsh literature
continuously; but no farther. If any thing be
older than the laws of Hoel Dhu, they must be<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
so by four centuries, with nothing in the interval.
This is the measure of the value of Welsh
evidence to the events of the fifth century.
Writers, however, in Latin existed earlier. Still,
this is unsufficient to be conclusive to the validity
of a fact in the fourth. Such a statement
must be tested by its own intrinsic probability.
It cannot come before us invested with the dignity
of a historically authenticated event. What
this is will soon appear.</p>

<p>If this be the spirit in which we must scrutinize
documentary evidence, with what eyes
must we look upon traditions&mdash;traditions wherein
the record, instead of being permanently registered,
is transmitted from mouth to mouth,
from father to son, from the old man to the
young, from generation to generation? The
mere etymological import of the word will mislead
us. It is not enough for a thing to have
been <i>handed down</i> from father to son. A relic
may be so transmitted; indeed, written papers
and printed books are traditions of this kind.
Heirlooms of any sort&mdash;whether belonging to
a nation or an individual&mdash;are such traditions as
these.</p>

<p>In a true tradition we must consider the <i>form</i>
and the <i>origin</i>. A narrative which has taken a
definite shape, either as a formula or a poem,
can scarcely be called a tradition. It is a specimen<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of composition handed down by tradition,
but not a tradition itself. It is an unwritten
record&mdash;as much a record in form and nature
as a written document, but differing from a
written document in the manner of its transmission
to posterity. Many a good judge believes
that the Homeric poems are older than
the art of writing, and, consequently, that they
were handed down to posterity orally. Yet no
one would say that the Iliad and Odyssey were
Greek traditions.</p>

<p>The fact of a narrative having taken a permanent
form, inasmuch as that permanent form
both facilitates its transmission, and ensures its
integrity, distinguishes an unwritten record from
a tradition.</p>

<p>A true account of a real event transmitted from
father to son in no set form of words, but told in
a way that a nursery tale is told to children, or
the way in which a piece of evidence is given in a
court of justice, constitutes a tradition; for in this
form only is it liable to those elements of uncertainty
which distinguish tradition from history&mdash;elements
which we must recognize, if we wish to
be precise in our language.</p>

<p>Such is its <i>form</i>, or rather its <i>want of form</i>.
But this is not enough. A tradition, to be anything
at all, must have a basis in fact, and represent
a real action, either accurately described or<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
but moderately misrepresented. I say <i>moderately
misrepresented</i>, because the absolute transmission
of anything beyond a mere list of names, and
dates, without addition, omission, or embellishment,
is a practical impossibility. Hence we must
allow for some inaccuracy; just as in mechanics
we must allow for friction. But, allowing for
this, we must still remember that the event and
the account of it, are correlative terms. An
opinion&mdash;an account of an account&mdash;only takes
the appearance of a tradition. It is a <i>tradition</i>
so far as it is <i>handed down</i> to posterity, but it
is no tradition with corresponding facts as a basis.</p>

<p>It is generally a theory&mdash;a theory, perhaps unconsciously
formed, but still a theory. Certain
phenomena, of which there is no historical explanation,
excite the notice of some one less incurious
than his fellows, and he attempts to account
for them. On the two opposite coasts of a sea&mdash;for
instance&mdash;two populations with the same
manners and language, are observed to reside.
A migration will account for this; and, consequently,
a migration is assumed. The view, being
reasonable, is generally adopted; and the fact of a
migration having absolutely taken place becomes
the current belief. The men who speak of this
in the fourth or fifth generation, speak of it as an
actual occurrence. So, perhaps, it is. But it is no
tradition notwithstanding; since the record cannot<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
be traced up to the event. All that posterity
has had handed-down from its ancestors, is an
<i>inference</i>; which, even if it be as good as the historical
account of an absolute event (as it sometimes
is), is anything but a tradition in the strict
sense of the term. Of course, the existence of
the inference itself can be reduced to a fact, and,
as such, produce a tradition. But this is not
the tradition which is wanted&mdash;not the tradition
which gives the fact in question.</p>

<p>These <i>ex post facto</i> traditions may be of any
amount of value, or of any degree of worthlessness.
They may be inferences of such accuracy
and justice as to command the respect of
the most critical; or they may involve impossibilities.
The extremes are the best; the former
for their intrinsic value, the latter from their
unlikelihood to mislead. The most dangerous
are the intermediate. Possibly, plausible, or, at
any rate, without any outward and visible marks
of condemnation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;">
<span class="i0">"They lie like truth, and yet most truly lie."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>What proportion do these <i>ex post facto</i> traditions
bear to the true ones? This is difficult to
say. A nickname, a genealogy, a tune may well
be transmitted by tradition. So may charms,
formul&aelig;, proverbs, and poems; yet when we
come to proverbs and poems we are on the domain<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of unwritten literature, a domain which
can scarcely be identified with that of tradition.
A local legend, when it is not too suspiciously
adapted to the features of the place to which
it applies, may also be admitted as traditional.
These and but little beyond. Men rarely think
about transmitting narratives until it is too late
for an authentic account.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the very mental activity
which employs itself upon the attempt to account
for an unexplained phenomenon is a sign
of attention; and where there is the attention
to speculate, there is likely to be the desire to
transmit. If so, it is probable that the proportion
of transmitted speculations to true traditions
is immeasurably large. But there is an
other reason for ignoring the so-called traditions.
When there is a tradition, and a true historical
record as well, the tradition is superfluous.
When a tradition stands alone, there is nothing
to confirm it. What can we do then? To assume
the fact from the truth of the tradition, and the
truth of the tradition from the existence of the
fact, is to argue in a circle. Two independent
traditions, however, may confirm each other.
When this happens the case is improved; but,
even then, they may be but similar inferences
from the same premises.</p>

<p>If, then, I allow no inference which I feel myself<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
justified in drawing to be disturbed by any
so-called tradition; and, if instead of seeing in
the accounts of our early writers a narrative
transmitted by word of mouth in lieu of a record
registered in writing, I deal with such apparent
narratives as if they were the inferences
of some later chronicler, I must not be accused
of undue presumption. The statements will still
be treated with respect, the more so, perhaps,
because they rest on induction rather than testimony;
and, as a general rule, they will be credited
with the merit of being founded on just
premises, even where those premises do not
appear. In other words, every writer will be
thought logical until there are reasons for suspecting
the contrary. For a true and genuine
tradition, however, I have so long sought in vain,
that I despair of ever finding one. If found, it
would be duly appreciated. On the other hand,
by treating their counterfeits as inferences, we
improve our position as investigators. A fact
we must take as it is told us, and take it without
any opportunity of correction&mdash;all or none;
whereas, an inference can be scrutinized and
amended. In the one case we receive instructions
from which we are forbidden to deviate;
in the other we act as judges, with a power to
pronounce decisions. Nor does it unfrequently
happen that our position in this respect is better<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
than that of the original writer; since, however,
many may be the facts which he may have had
for his opinion beyond those which he has transmitted
to posterity, there are others of which he
must have been ignorant, and with which <i>we</i>
are familiar. Changing the expression, where
there is anything like an equality of <i>data</i>, the
means of using them is in favour of the later
inquirer as against the earlier; in which case he
understands antiquity better than the ancients&mdash;presumptuous
as the doctrine may be. With a
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> piece of testimony, however traditionary,
documentary, or cotemporaneous, the case
is reversed, and the modern writer must listen
to his senior with thankful deference. And this
it is that makes the distinction between inference
and evidence so important. To mistake the
former for the latter is to overvalue antiquity
and exclude ourselves from a legitimate and fertile
field of research. To confound the latter
with the former, is to raise ourselves into criticism
when our business is simply to interpret.</p>

<p>Proceeding to details, we find that the <i>Historia
Gild&aelig;</i> and the <i>Epistola Gild&aelig;</i> are the two
earliest works upon Anglo-Saxon Britain. For
reasons which will soon appear, these works are
referred to <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 550. The class of facts for which
the evidence of a writer of this date is wanted,
is that which contains the particulars of the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
history of Britain during the last days of the
Roman, and the beginning of the Anglo-Saxon
domination. Amongst these, the more important
would be the rebellion of Maximus, the Pict
and Scot inroads, the earliest Germanic invasions,
and the subordination of the Romans to the
Saxons. But all these are deeds of devastation,
and, as such, unfavourable to even the existence
of the scanty literature necessary to record them.
Again, there were two other changes, equally unfavourable
to the preservation of records, going
on. Pagan or Classical literature was becoming
Christian or Medieval, whilst the Latin or Roman
style was passing into Byzantine and Greek.
Ammianus Marcellinus, the last of the Latin
Pagan historians, was cotemporary with the
events at the beginning of the period in question.
Procopius, one of the last Pagan writers
of Byzantium, died about the same time as
Gildas.</p>

<p>Hence, the 150 years&mdash;from <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 400 to 550&mdash;for
which alone the history of Gildas is wanted,
is an era of excessive obscurity. Are the merits
of the author proportionate? Is the light he
brings commensurate with the darkness? What
could he know? What does he tell? He tells
so little that the question as to the value of his
authorities is reduced to nearly nothing; and, of
that little which we learn from his wordy and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
turgid pages, the smallest fraction only is of any
ethnological interest. Indeed, Gildas is most
worth notice for what he leaves unsaid. The rebellion
of Maximus he mentions; but he is not
answerable for the migration from Britain to
Brittany, on which (as already stated) so much
turns. The Saxons, too, he mentions, and the
name of Vortigern&mdash;but he is not answerable for
the derivation of the name from the word <i>Sahs</i>=<i>dagger</i>.
In regard to the important question as
to the date of the invasion, and the number of
the invaders, he fixes 150 years before his own
time, and gives <i>three</i> as the number of their vessels
(<i>cyul&aelig;</i>). Aurelius Ambrosius and the Pugna
Badonica are especially alluded to, the date of
the latter event being the date of his own birth.
As this is an event which he might have known
from his parents, and as the later Roman writers
are our authorities until (there or thereabouts)
the death of Honorius, it remains to inquire
upon what testimonies Gildas gave the few events
which he notices between the years 417<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and
516. Is there anything which by suggesting the
existence of native cotemporary documents should
induce us to consider his evidence as conclusive?
I think not. Such may or may not have existed,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the presumption being for or against them, according
to the view which the inquirer takes
respecting the literary and civilizational influences
of the expiring Paganism of the Romans,
and the incipient Christianity of the early British
Church, combined with the antiquity of the earliest
British and Irish records&mdash;a wide and complex
subject, if treated generally, but if viewed
with reference to the specific case before us (the
authorities of Gildas), a narrow one.</p>

<p>In the case of Gildas it is perfectly unnecessary
to assume anything of the kind. The only material
facts which he gives us are the letter to
&AElig;tius for assistance, and a notice of the place
which Vortigern finds in the downfall of the
Romano-British empire. The first of these points
to Rome rather than to Britain; the second is
from the life of a Gallic missionary&mdash;St. Germanus
of Auxerre. To this may be added the high
probability of Gildas' work having been written
in Gaul; a fact which, undoubtedly, subtracts
from the little value it might otherwise possess.</p>

<p>The next is an author of a very different calibre,
the venerable Beda; concerning whom we
must remember that he stands in contrast to
Gildas from being Anglo-Saxon rather than British.
Now, his history is Ecclesiastical and not
Civil; so that ethnological questions make no part
of his inquiries, and, as far as they are treated<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
at all, they are treated incidentally. Whatever
may have been the records of the Romano-British
Church, or the compositions of Romano-British
writers, they form no part of the materials of
Beda. The most he says that, from <i>writings and
traditions</i> along with the information derived
from the monks of the Abbey of Lestingham, he
wrote that part of his work which gives an account
of the Christianity of the kingdom of
Mercia. For the other parts of the kingdom he
chiefly applied to the Bishop of the Diocese; to
Albinus for the antiquities of Kent and Essex;
and to Daniel for those of Wessex, the Isle of
Wight, and Sussex. For Lincolnshire he had
<i>viva voce</i> information from Cynebert, and the
monks of the Abbey of Partney; and for Northumberland
he made his inquiries himself. Now
as Christianity was first introduced into Anglo-Saxon
England by Augustine, <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 597, the era of
the Germanic invasions lies beyond the evidence
of either Beda or his authorities. Gildas, and the
sources of Gildas he knew; but of access to native
records of the fifth century&mdash;the century for
which they are most wanted&mdash;or of the existence
of such, no trace occurs in the Historia Ecclesiastica,
except in the two doubtful cases which will
appear in the sequel.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In Nennius, more than in any other writer, do<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
we find it necessary to assume the existence of
any previous historians, upon whose authority the
facts of the times between the cessation of the
Roman supremacy, and the consolidation of the
Anglo-Saxon power may be received; and in
Nennius we must, for many reasons, admit it.
In the first place, he mentions more than one circumstance
which he could not well have got from
any other source; in the next, the preface says
that what has been done has been done "partim
majorum traditionibus; partem scriptis; partim
etiam monumentis veterum Britanni&aelig; incolarum;
partim et de annalibus Romanorum. Insuper
et de chronicis sanctorum Patrum, Ysidori, scilicet
Hieronymi, Prosperi, Eusebii, necnon et de historiis
Scotorum Saxonumque, inimicorum licet,
non ut volui, sed ut potui, meorum obtemperans
jussionibus seniorum, unam hanc historiunculam
undecunque collectam balbutiendo coacervari."
But, it should be added that the authenticity of
the preface is doubtful.</p>

<p>Nennius, then, most introduces the question as
to the value of the narratives of the events of the
fifth century. I cannot but put it exceedingly
low. Of any <i>historian</i>, properly so called, there
is not a trace. Neither is there of regular annals,
a point which will soon be considered more fully.
Nor yet of any of even the humbler forms of
narrative poetry; though this is a point upon<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
which I speak with hesitation. I base my opinion,
however, upon the notices of the two chief epochs&mdash;that
of Vortigern and that of King Arthur.
The first is from the life of St. Germanus, the
second is an unadorned enumeration of three
campaigns, with as little of the appearance of
being derived from a poetic source as is possible.</p>

<p>Several genealogies occur in Nennius; and it
often happens that genealogies are useful elements
of criticism. British ethnology, however,
is not the department in which their value is
most conspicuous.</p>

<p>How far were the traditions of Nennius of any
worth? The following is a specimen of them.
"The Britons were named after Brutus; Brutus
was the son of Hisicion, Hisicion of Alanus, Alanus
of Rea Silvia, Rea Silvia of Numa, Numa of
Pamphilus, Pamphilus of Ascanius, Ascanius of
&AElig;neas, &AElig;neas of Anchises, Anchises of Tros, Tros
of Dardanus, the son of Flire, the son of Javan,
the son of Japhet. This Japhet had seven sons;
the first Gomer, from whom came the Gauls; the
second Magog, from whom came the Scythians
and Goths; the third Aialan, from whom came
the Medes; the fourth Javan, whence the Greeks;
the fifth Tubal, whence the Hebrews; the sixth
Mesech, whence the Cappadocians; the seventh
Troias, whence the Thracians. These are the sons
of Japhet, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I will now return to the point whence I departed.</p>

<p>"The first man of the race of Japhet came to
Europe, Alanus by name, with his three sons.
Their names were Ysicion, Armenon, and Neguo.
Ysicion had four sons, their names were Frank,
Roman, Alemann, and Briton, from whom Britain
was first inhabited. But Armenon had five sons.
These are Goth, Walagoth, Cebid, Burgundian,
Longobard. Neguo had four sons, Wandal, Saxon,
Bogar, Turk. From Hisicio the first-born of Alan,
arose four natives, the Franks, the Latins, the
Alemanns, and the Britons. From Armenon, the
second son of Alan, came the Goths, the Vandals,
the Cebidi, and the Longobards. From Neguo,
the third, the Bogars, Vandals, Saxons, and Tarinci.
But these nations were subdivided over all
Europe. Alanius, however, as they say, was the
son of Sethevir, the son of Ogomnum, the son of
Thois, the son of Boib, the son of Simeon, the
son of Mair, the son of Ethac, the son of Luothar,
the son of Ecthel, the son of Oothz, the son of
Aborth, the son of Ra, the son of Esra, the son of
Israu, the son of Barth, the son of Jonas, the son
of Jabath, the son of Japhet, the son of Noah, the
son of Lamech, the son of Methusalem, the son of
Enoch, the son of Jareth, the son of Malalel, the
son of Cainan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth,
the son of Adam, the son of the living God."<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely this is but a piece of book-learning spoilt
in the application. Yet what says the author?</p>

<p>"This genealogy I found in the traditions of
the ancients, who were the inhabitants of Britain
in the earliest times."&mdash;<i>Historia Britonum</i>, cap.
xiii.</p>

<p>The next two works are chronicles, so-called;
one British and one Anglo-Saxon; the <i>Annales
Cambri&aelig;</i> and the <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>The notices of the <i>Annales Cambri&aelig;</i> are remarkably
brief and scanty. It has scarcely one
for every second year, and what it has is short
and unimportant.</p>

<p>It begins with <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 447, and ends with the
Norman Conquest. It is closely confined to the
events of Wales.</p>

<p>The date and authorship are uncertain. Of
the three MSS. which supply the text, one is
said to be as old as <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 954.</p>

<p>When the entries began to be cotemporary
with the events registered is uncertain; indeed,
there is no proof that they are so anywhere. On
the other hand, they cannot be earlier than <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span>
521, since the event registered there is the <i>birth
of St. Columba</i>. Now the entry of the birth of
an illustrious personage is not likely to be a
cotemporaneous entry; since his greatness has
yet to be achieved, and it is only the spirit of
prophecy and anticipation that such a record<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
would be made at the time he merely came into
the world.</p>

<p>The year 522, then, is the earliest possible cotemporary
entry, and this is, most likely, much
too early.</p>

<p>But the work has not the appearance of being
a register of cotemporaneous events at all. In
such a composition the idlest chronicler would
find something to say under each year, and notices
of either local events, or the great events of
general interest, could scarcely fail to be entered.
No one, however, will say that such a series of
entries as the following from <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 501 to <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 601,
can ever have constituted cotemporary history.</p>

<p>The notices between the brackets are not found
in the Harleian MS.&mdash;one of three.</p>

<p>The years are counted from the commencement
of the Annals, which, from circumstances independent
of the text, is fixed <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 444. Hence,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
lvii and clvii, coincide with <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 501, and <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 601,
respectively. It is not until the last quarter of
the tenth century that the entries notably improve
in fulness and frequency; during which period
the table was probably composed,&mdash;the earlier
dates being put down not because they were of
either local or general importance, but because
they were known to the writer. Such, at least,
is the inference from the style. Lives of Saints
may have furnished them all. They agree more
or less with the Irish Annals, and, probably, are
to a great extent taken from the same sources.</p>

<p>The <i>Annales Cambrenses</i> contain few or no
facts directly bearing upon the ethnology of Great
Britain, except so far as the existence of a literary
composition, of a given antiquity, is the
measure of the civilization of the country to
which it belongs.</p>

<p>One of its entries, however, has an indirect
bearing. The value of Gildas depends upon the
time at which he wrote. We have already seen
that a small piece of autobiography in his history
tells us that he was born in the year of the
<i>Bellum Badonicum</i>. Now the date of this is
got from the Annales Cambrenses, <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 516.
There is no reason to believe it other than accurate.</p>

<p>It were well if such a composition as the
<i>Annales Cambri&aelig;</i> were called (what it really is)<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a list of dates; since the word <i>chronicle</i> has a
dangerous tendency to engender a very uncritical
laxity of thought. It continually gets mistaken
for a <i>register</i>; yet the two sorts of composition
are wholly different. That the habit of making
cotemporaneous entries of events as they happen,
just as incumbents of parishes, each in his order
of succession, enter the births, deaths, and marriages
of their parishioners, should exist in such
institutions as religious monasteries or civil guild-halls,
is by no means unlikely. But, then, on
the other hand, there is an equal likelihood of
nothing of the sort being attempted. Hence,
when a work reaches posterity in the shape of
a chronicle or annals, its antiquity and value
must be judged on its own merits, rather than
according to any preconceived opinions.</p>

<p>In mechanics <i>nothing is stronger than its
weakest part</i>, and it would be well if a similar
apothegm could be extended to the criticism of
such compositions as the Annales Cambri&aelig;, and
the Saxon Chronicle. It would be well if we
could say that in chronological tables <i>nothing
was earlier than the latest entry</i>. In common
histories we do this. The common historian is
always supposed to have composed his work subsequent
to the date of the latest event contained
in it&mdash;a few exceptions only being made for
those authors whose works treat of cotemporary<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
actions. So it is with the annalist whose Annals,
more ambitious in form than the bare chronicle,
emulate, like those of the great Roman historian,
the style of history. But it is not so when the
notices pass a certain limit, and become short
and scanty. They then suggest a comparison
with the parish register, or the Olympic records,
and change their character altogether. No longer
mere chronological works, emanating from the
pen of a single author, and referrible to some
single generation, subsequent, in general, to a
majority of the events set down in them, they
are the productions of a series of writers, each
of whom is a registrar of cotemporary events.
By this an undue value attaches itself to works
which have nothing in common with the register
but the form.</p>

<p>Now, if genuine traditions are scarce, real registers
are scarcer. In both cases, however, the
false wears the garb of the true, and, in both
cases, writers shew an equal repugnance to scrutiny.
This is to be regretted; since with nine
out of ten of the chronicles that have come down
to us, it is far more certain that their latest facts
are earlier in date than the author who records
them, than that the earliest possible author can
have been cotemporary with the first recorded
events. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle may illustrate
this. It ends in the reign of Stephen; yet<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the writer of even the last page may have been
anything but a cotemporary with the events it
embodies. It begins with the invasion of Julius
C&aelig;sar. A cotemporary entry&mdash;the essential element
of registration&mdash;is out of the question here.</p>

<p>The general rule with compositions of the kind
in question is, that they fall into two parts, the
first of which cannot be of equal antiquity with
the events recorded, the second of which may be;
and we are only too fortunate when satisfactory
proofs of cotemporary composition enable us to
convert the possible into the probable, the probable
into the certain&mdash;the <i>may</i> into the <i>must</i>.
Even when this is the case, the proportions of
the cotemporary to the non-cotemporary statements
are generally uncertain&mdash;a question of
<i>more</i> or <i>less</i>, that must be settled by the examination
of the particular composition under consideration.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the other merits of the <i>Annales
Cambri&aelig;</i>, it has no claim to the title of a
register during the sixth century&mdash;and, <i>a fortiori</i>
none during the fifth.</p>

<p>Neither has the Saxon Chronicle. We infer
this from the extent to which it follows Beda.
We infer it, too, still more certainly from the
following passage&mdash;a passage which, if made in
the year under which it is found, would be no
record but a prophecy.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 595.&mdash;"This year &AElig;thelbriht succeeded to
the kingdom of the Kentish men, and held it
fifty-three years. In his days the Holy Pope
Gregory sent us baptism. That was in the two-and-thirtieth
year of his reign; and Columba, a
mass-priest, came to the Picts and converted them
to the faith of Christ. They are dwellers by the
northern mountains. And their king gave him
the island which is called Hi. Therein are fine
hides of land, as men say. There Columba built
a monastery, and he was abbot there thirty-two
years, and there he died when he was seventy-seven
years old. His successors still have the
place. The Southern Picts had been baptized
long before; Bishop Ninias, who had been instructed
at Rome, had preached baptism to them,
whose church and monastery is at Hwithern,
hallowed in the name of St. Martin; there he
resteth with many holy men. Now, in Hi
there must ever be an abbot and not a bishop;
and all the Scottish bishops ought to be subject
to him, because Columba was an abbot, not
a bishop."</p>

<p>Similar notices, impossible, without a vast
amount of gratuitous assumption, to be considered
cotemporaneous, are of frequent occurrence
until long after the consolidation of the
Anglo-Saxon power in England; but as the
events of the fifth and sixth centuries are the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
only events of ethnological importance, the notice
of them is limited.</p>

<p>The Welsh poems attributed to the bards of
the sixth and seventh centuries, contain no facts
that will make part of any of our reasonings in
the sequel. Their existence is, of course, a measure
of the intellectual calibre of the time (whatever
that may be) to which they refer. But this
is not before us now.</p>

<p>In respect to the value of the Irish annals, the
civil historian has a far longer list of problems
than the ethnologist; since the latter wants their
testimony upon a few points only, <i>e.g.</i>, 1. The
origin of the proper Irish themselves; 2. the
affinities of the Picts; 3. the migration (real or
supposed) of the Scots. These, at least, are the
chief points. Others, of course, such as the details
concerning the Danes, can be found; but
the ones in question are the chief.</p>

<p>In respect to the first, whoever reads Dr. Prichard's<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
account of the contents of the earliest
chronicles, consisting, amongst other matters, of
an antediluvian C&aelig;sar; a landing of Partholanus
with his wife Ealga, on the coast of Connemara,
twelve years after the Deluge, and on the
14th of May; the colony of the Neimhidh, descendants
of Gog and Magog; the Fir-Bolg from
the Thrace; the Tuatha de Danann from Athens;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and, above all, the famous Milesians, amongst
whom was Nial, the intimate of Moses and
Aaron, and the husband of Scota the daughter
of Pharaoh, will soon satisfy himself that, with
the exception of a little weight which may possibly
be due to the prominence which the Spanish
Peninsula takes in the several legends, the whole
mass is so utterly barren in historical results,
that criticism would be misplaced.</p>

<p>But the Pict and Scot questions are in a different
predicament. Like the Roman and Anglo-Saxon
conquests of Britain, the events connected
with them may have occurred within the Historical
period&mdash;provided only that that period begin
early enough.</p>

<p>How far this may be the case with the Irish
annals is a reasonable question.</p>

<p>That any existing series of Irish annals anterior
to the time of the earliest extant annalist,
Tigernach, who lived in the eleventh century, is
cotemporary with the events which it records,
so as to partake of the nature of a register, is
what no one has asserted; and hence their credit
rests upon that of such earlier records as may be
supposed to have served as their basis.</p>

<p>These may be poems, genealogies, or chronicles;
all of which may be admitted to have existed.
How long? In a more or less imperfect form
from the introduction of Christianity. Is this the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
extreme limit in the way of antiquity? Probably;
perhaps certainly. Out of all the numerous
pieces of verse quoted by the annalists, one
only carries us back to a Pagan period, and even
this is referred to a year subsequent to the introduction
of Christianity. An extract from the
annals of the Four Masters is as follows, <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span>
458, twenty-seven years after the first arrival of
St. Patrick "after Laogar, the son of Nial of the
Nine Hostages, had reigned in Ireland thirty
years, he was killed in the country of <i>Caissi</i> (?)
between Eri and Albyn, <i>i.e.</i>, the two hills in the
country of the Faolain, and the Sun and Wind
killed him, for he violated them; whence the
poet sings&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Laogar M'Nial died in Caissi the green land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The elements of divine things, by the oath which he violated, inflicted the doom of death on the king."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The genealogies are generally contained in the
poems.</p>

<p>As to annals partaking of the nature of registers
the language of the extant compositions is
unfavourable. They are mentioned, of course;
but it is always some one's collection of something
before his time&mdash;never the original cotemporary
documents. Now the compiler is Cormac
McArthur, now St. Patrick. The manner of their
mention in the Four Masters is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 266 was the fortieth year of Cormac<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
McArthur McConn over the kingdom of Ireland,
until he died at Clete, after a salmon-bone had
stuck in his throat, from old prophecies which
Malgon the Druid had made against him, after
Cormac turned against the Druids on account of
his manner of adoring God without them. For
that reason the Devil (<i>Diabul</i>) tempted him
(Malgenn) through the instigation, until he caused
his death. It was Cormac who composed the
precepts to be observed by kings, the manners,
tribute, and ordinations of kings. He was a wise
man in laws, and in things chronological and historical,
for it was he who invented the laws of the
judgments, and the right principles in all bargains,
also the tributes, so that there was a law
which bound all men even unto the present time.
This Cormac McArthur was he who collected the
Chronicle of Ireland into one place, Tara, until he
formed from them the Chronicles of Ireland in
one book, which was called (afterwards) the Psalter
of Tara. In that book were the events and
synchronisms of the kings of Ireland with the
kings and emperors of the world, and of the
kings of the provinces with the kings of Ireland."</p>

<p>A work of this kind, possible enough in Alexandria,
is surely in need of very definite and unexceptionable
testimony to make it credible as
a piece of Irish history. The truly historical fact
contained in the extract is the existence of a book,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
at the time of the Four Masters, with a Christian
title, and Pagan contents.</p>

<p>To assume anything beyond the existence of
early biographies of the early propagators of
Irish Christianity is unnecessary. These had an
undoubted existence; sometimes in prose, sometimes
in verse; and it is these that the annalists
themselves chiefly refer to; the character of
whose notices may be collected from the following
extracts relating to the first arrival of St.
Patrick.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 430.&mdash;The second year of Laogar. In this
year Pope Celestine first sent Palladius, the
bishop, to Ireland, to preach the faith to the
Irish, and there came with him twelve companions.
Nathe, the son of Garchon, opposed him.
Going onwards, however, he baptized many in
Ireland; and three churches, built of wood, were
built by him, the White Church, the House of
the Romans, and <i>Domnach Arta</i> (<i>Dominica

to <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 430; and isolated events, without much
reference to their importance, is what we get from<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
them. As soon as Christianity introduces the
use of letters, we see our way to the preservation
of the records, and the dawning of history begins.</p>

<p>If the annals of the Christian period rest almost
wholly on Christian records, what can be the authority
of the still earlier histories? Separate substantive
proof of the existence of early historians,
or early poets there is none. We only assume it
from the events narrated. We also assume the
event from the narrative; and, so doing, argue
in a circle. The fact from the statement, and the
statement from the fact. Such is too often the
case.</p>

<p>An additional century of antiquity may be
gained by admitting the existence of an imperfect
Christianity in Ireland anterior to the time
of St. Patrick&mdash;though the evidence to it is questionable.
The annals anterior to <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 340 will
still stand over. They fall into two divisions;
the impossible, or self-confuting, and the possible.
The latter extend over seven centuries from about
<span class="smcapl">B.C.</span> 308 to <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 430. The former go back to the
Creation, and are given up as untrustworthy by
the native annalists themselves.</p>

<p>The early annals of the class in question which
give us possible events, if they existed at all, must
have been in Irish. They must also have been
more or less known to King Cormac McArthur.
They imply, too, the use of an alphabet. St. Patrick,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
too, must have known them; as is implied
by the following extract:&mdash;</p>

Ireland, Corcc, and Daire, three kings; Patrick,

<p>The Welsh antiquarian may, perhaps, observe
that this likeness to the Triads is suspicious, a
view to which he may find plenty of confirmation
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Neither is it too much to say that such old
poems as are quoted in respect to the events of
the second and third centuries, are apparently
quoted as Virgil's description of Italy under
Evander might be quoted by a writer of the
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The events recorded are, as a general rule, probable;
but they cannot be considered real until
we see our way to the evidence by which they<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
could be transmitted. The probable is as often
untrue, as the true is improbable. The question
in all these points is one of testimony.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory view of that period of
Irish antiquity, which is, at one and the same
time, anterior to the introduction of Christianity,
and subsequent to the earliest mention of Ireland
by Greek, Latin, and British writers, is that the
sources of its history were compositions composed
out of Ireland, but containing notices of Irish
events; in which case the Britons and Romans
have written more about Ireland than the Irish
themselves. This is an inference partly from the
presumptions of the case, and partly from internal
evidence.</p>

<p>Prichard, after Sharon Turner, has remarked
that the legend of Partholanus is found in Nennius.</p>

<p>The Welsh name Arthur, strange to Ireland,
except during the period in question, is prominent
in the third century.</p>

<p>The Druidical religion, which on no unequivocal
evidence can be shewn to have been Irish,
has the same prominence during the same time.</p>

<p>The <i>Fir-Bolg</i> and <i>Attecheith</i> are also prominent
at this time, <i>but not later</i>. Now the <i>Belg&aelig;</i> and
<i>Attacotti</i> might easily be got from British or
Roman writers. The soil of Ireland, as soon as
its records improve, ceases to supply them.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>This is as far as it is necessary to proceed in
the criticism of our early authorities of British,
Irish, and Saxon origin, since it is not the object
of the present writer to throw any unnecessary
discredit over them, but only to inquire how far
they are entitled to the claim of deciding certain
questions finally, and of precluding criticism. It
is clear that they are only to be admitted when
opposed by a very slight amount of conflicting
improbabilities, when speaking to points capable
of being known, and when freed from several
elements of error and confusion. The practical
application of this inference will find place in the
eleventh chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p>THE ANGLES OF GERMANY: THEIR COMPARATIVE OBSCURITY.&mdash;NOTICE
OF TACITUS.&mdash;EXTRACT FROM PTOLEMY.&mdash;CONDITIONS OF
THE ANGLE AREA.&mdash;THE VARINI.&mdash;THE REUDIGNI AND OTHER
POPULATIONS OF TACITUS.&mdash;THE SABALINGII, ETC., OF PTOLEMY.&mdash;THE
SUEVI ANGILI.&mdash;ENGLE AND ONGLE.&mdash;ORIGINAL ANGLE
AREA.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are several populations of whom, like
quiet and retiring individuals, we know nothing
until they move; for, in their original countries,
they lead a kind of still life which escapes notice
and description, and which, if it were not for a
change of habits with a change of area, would
place them in the position of the great men who
lived before Agamemnon. They would pass from
the development to the death of their separate
existence unobserved, and no one know who they
were, where they lived, and what were their relations.
But they move to some new locality, and
then, like those fruit-trees which, in order to be
prolific, must be transplanted, the noiseless and
unnoticed tenor of their original way is exchanged
for an influential and prominent position.
They take up a large place in the world's
history. Sometimes this arises from an absolute
change of character with the change of circumstances;
but oftener it is due to a more intelligible<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
cause. They move from a country beyond
the reach of historical and geographical knowledge
to one within it; and having done this
they find writers who observe and describe them,
simply because they have come within the field
of observation and description.</p>

<p>It is no great stretch of imagination to picture
some of the stronger tribes of the now unknown
parts of Central Africa finding their way as far
southward as the Cape, when they would come
within the sphere of European observation. On
such a ground, they may play a conspicuous part
in history; conspicuous enough to be noticed by
historians, missionaries, and journalists. They
may even form the matter of a blue book. For
all this, however, they shall only be known in the
latter-days of their history. What they were in
their original domain may remain a mystery;
and that, even when the parts wherein it lay
shall have become explored. For it is just possible
that between the appearance of such a population
in a locality beyond the pale of their own
unexplored home, and the subsequent discovery
of that previously obscure area, the part which
was left behind&mdash;the parent portion&mdash;may have
lost its nationality, its language, its locality, its
independence, its name&mdash;any one or any number
of its characteristics. Perhaps, the name alone,
with a vague notice of its locality, may remain;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a name famous from the glory of its new country,
but obscure, and even equivocal in its fatherland.</p>

<p>How truly are the Majiars of Hungary known
only from what they have been in Hungary.
Yet they are no natives of that country. It was
from the parts beyond the Uralian mountains
that they came, and when we visit those parts
and ask for their original home, we find no such
name, no such language, no such nationality as
that of the Majiars. We find Bashkirs, or something
equally different instead. But north of the
old country of the Majiars&mdash;now no longer Majiar&mdash;we
find Majiar characteristics; in other
words, we are amongst the first cousins of the
Hungarians, the descendants not of the exact
ancestors of the conquerors of Hungary, but of
the populations most nearly allied to such ancestors.
And it is in these that we must study the
Majiar before he became European. The direct descendants
of the same parents have disappeared,
but collateral branches of the family survive; and
these we study, <i>assuming that there is a family
likeness</i>.</p>

<p>All this has been written in illustration of a
case near home. The Majiar of the Uralian wilds,
the Majiar of the Yaik and Oby, the Majiar, in
short, of Asia, is not more obscure, unknown, and
unimportant when compared with the countrymen<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of Hunyades, Zapolya, and Kossuth, than is
the Angle of Germany when contrasted with the
Angle of England, the Angle of the great continent
with the Angle of the small island. When
we say that the former is named by Tacitus,
Ptolemy, and a few other less important writers,
we have said all. There is the name, and little
enough besides. What does the most learned
ethnologist know of a people called the <i>Eudoses</i>?
Nothing. He speculates, perhaps, on a letter-change,
and fancies that by prefixing a <i>Ph</i>, and
inserting an <i>n</i> he can convert the name into
<i>Phundusii</i>. But what does he know of the
Phundusii? Nothing; except that by ejecting
the <i>ph</i> and omitting the <i>n</i> he can reduce them
to <i>Eudoses</i>. Then come the <i>Aviones</i>, whom, by
omission and rejection, we can identify with the
<i>Obii</i>, of whom we know little, and also convert
into the <i>Cobandi</i>, of whom we know less. The
<i>Reudigni</i>&mdash;what light comes from these? The
<i>Nuithones</i>&mdash;what from these? The <i>Suardones</i>&mdash;what
from these? Now, it is not going too far
if we say that, were it not for the conquest of
England, the Angles of Germany would have
been known to the ethnologist just as the <i>Aviones</i>
are, <i>i.e.</i>, very little; that, like the <i>Eudoses</i>,
they might have had their very name tampered
with; and that, like the <i>Suardones</i> and <i>Reudigni</i>
and <i>Nuithones</i>, they might have been anything<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
or nothing in the way of ethnological
affinity, historical development, and geographical
locality.</p>

<p>This is the true case. Nine-tenths of what is
known of the Angli of Germany is known from
a single passage, and every word in that single
passage which applies to Angli applies to the
<i>Eudoses</i>, <i>Aviones</i>, <i>Reudigni</i>, <i>Suardones</i>, and
<i>Nuithones</i> as well.</p>

<p>The passage in question is the 40th section of
the Germania of Tacitus, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Contra Langobardos paucitas nobilitat: plurimis
ac valentissimis nationibus cincti non per
obsequium sed pr&aelig;liis et periclitando tuti sunt.
Reudigni, deinde, et Aviones, et Angli, et Varini,
et Suardones, et Nuithones fluminibus aut sylvis
muniuntur; neque quidquam notabile in singulis
nisi quod in commune Hertham, id est, Terram
Matrem colunt, eamque intervenire rebus hominum,
invehi populis arbitrantur. Est in insula
Oceani castum nemus, dicatum in eo vehiculum,
veste contectum, attingere uni sacerdoti concessum.
Is adesse penetrali deam intelligit, vectamque
bobus feminis multa cum veneratione
prosequitur. L&aelig;ti tunc dies, festa loca, qu&aelig;cunque
adventu hospitioque dignatur. Non bella
ineunt, non arma sumunt, clausum omne ferrum;
pax et quies tunc tantum nota, tunc tantum
amata, donec idem sacerdos satiatam conversatione<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
mortalium deam templo reddat: mox
vehiculum et vestes, et si credere velis, numen
ipsum secreto lacu abluitur. Servi ministrant,
quos statim idem lacus haurit. Arcanus hinc
terror, sanctaque ignorantia, quid sit id, quod
perituri tantum vident."</p>

<p>Let us ask what we get from this passage <i>when
taken by itself</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, without the light thrown
upon it by the present existence of the descendants
of the Angli as the English of England.</p>

<p>We get the evidence of a good writer, that six
nations considered by him as sufficiently Germanic
to be included in his <i>Germania</i>, were far
enough north of the Germans who came in immediate
contact with Rome to be briefly and imperfectly
described and near enough the sea to
frequent an island worshipping a goddess with
a German name and certain remarkable attributes.
This is the most we get; and to get this
we must shut our eyes to more than one complication.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Thus the country that can most reasonably
be assigned to the <i>Varini</i>, is in the tenth century
the country of the <i>Varnavi</i>, who are no
Germans, but Slavonians.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Another reading, instead of <i>Hertham</i>, is
<i>Nerthum</i>, a name less decidedly Germanic.</p>

<p>All we get beyond this is from their subsequent
histories; and of these subsequent histories<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
there is only one&mdash;the <i>Angle</i> or <i>English</i>.
Truly, then, may we say that the Angles of Germany
are only known from their <i>relations to the
Angles of England</i>.</p>

<p>Let us inquire into the geographical and ethnological
conditions of the Angli of Tacitus; and
first in respect to their geography.</p>

<p>1. They must be placed as far north as the
Weser; because the area required for the Cherusci,
Fosi, Chasuarii, Dulgubini, Chamavi, and Angrivarii
must be carried to a certain extent northwards;
and the populations in question lay beyond
these.</p>

<p>2. They must not be carried very far north of
the Elbe. The reasons for this are less conclusive.
They lie, however, in the circumstance of
<i>Ptolemy's</i> notices placing them in a decidedly
<i>southern</i> direction; and, as Tacitus has left their
locality an open question, the evidence of even a
worse authority than Ptolemy ought to be decisive,&mdash;"of
the nations of the interior the greatest
is that of <i>Suevi Angili</i>, who are the most eastern
of the Longobardi, stretching as far northwards
as the middle Elbe." The same writer precludes
us from placing them in Holstein and Sleswick
by filling up the Peninsula by populations other
than Angle, one of which is the Saxon. But these
Saxons we are not at liberty to identify with the
Angli of Tacitus, because, by so doing, we separate<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
them from the more evidently related <i>Angili</i> of
Ptolemy. Ptolemy draws a distinction between
the two, and writes that "after the Chauci on the
neck of the Cimbric Chersonese, came the Saxons,
after the Saxons, as far as the river Chalusus, the
Pharodini. In the Chersonese itself there extend,
beyond the Saxons, the Sigulones on the west,
then the Sabalingii, then the Cobandi, above them
the Chali, then above these, but more to the west,
the Phundusii; more to the east the Charudes,
and most of all to the north, the Cimbri."</p>

<p>3. They must not come quite up to the sea,
since we have seen from Ptolemy that the Chauci
and Saxones joined, and as the Saxons were on
the neck of the Peninsula, or the south-eastern
parts of Holstein, the Chauci must have lain
between the Angli and the sea, probably, however,
on a very narrow strip of coast.</p>

<p>4. They must not have reached eastwards much
farther than the frontiers of Lauenburg and Luneburg,
since, as soon as we get definite historical
notices of these countries, they are <i>Slavonic</i>&mdash;and,
whatever may be said to the contrary, there
is no evidence of this Slavonic occupancy being
recent.</p>

<p>These conditions give us the northern part of
the kingdom of Hanover as the original Angle
area.</p>

<p>Their ethnological affinities are simpler. They<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
spoke the language which afterwards became
the Anglo-Saxon of Alfred, and the English of
Milton. In this we have the first and most
definite of their differential characteristics&mdash;the
characteristics which distinguished them from
the closely allied Cheruscans, Chamavi, Angrivarii
and other less important nations.</p>

<p>Their religious <i>cultus</i>, as far at least as the
worship of <i>Mother Earth</i> in a Holy Island, was
a link which connected the Angli with the populations
to the north rather than to the south
of them; and&mdash;as far as we may judge from the
negative fact of finding no Angles in the great
confederacy that the energy of Arminius formed
against the aggression of Rome&mdash;their political
relations did the same. But this is uncertain.</p>

<p>Such was the supposed area of the ancient
Angles of Germany, and it agrees so well with
all the ethnological conditions of the populations
around, that it should not be objected to, or refined
upon, on light grounds. The two varieties
of the German languages to which the Anglo-Saxon
bore the closest relationship, were the
Old Saxon and the Frisian, and each of these
are made conterminous with it by the recognition
of the area in question&mdash;the Old Saxon to
the south, the Frisian to the west, and, probably,
to the north as well. It is an area, too, which is
neither unnecessarily large, nor preposterously<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
small; an area which gives its occupants the
navigable portions of two such rivers as the Elbe
and Weser; one which places them in the necessary
relations to their Holy Island (an island
which, for the present we assume to be Heligoland);
and, lastly, one which without being exactly
the nearest part of the continent, fronts
Britain, and is well situated for descents upon
the British coast.</p>

<p>During the third, fourth, and fifth centuries we
hear nothing of the Angli. They re-appear in the
eighth. But then they are the Angles of Beda,
the Angles of Britain&mdash;not those of Germany&mdash;the
Angles of a new locality, and of a conquered
country&mdash;not the parent stock on its original continental
home. Of these latter the history of Beda
says but little. Neither does the history of any
other writer; indeed it is not too much to say that
they have no authentic, detailed, and consecutive
history at all, either early or late, either in the time
of Beda when the Angles of England are first described,
or in the time of any subsequent writer.
There are reasons for this; as will be seen if we
look to their geographical position, and the relations
between them and the neighbouring populations.
The Angles of Germany were too far north
to come in contact with the Romans. That we met
with no Angli in the great Arminian Confederacy
has already been stated. When the Romans were<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the aggressors, the Angli lay beyond the pale of
their ambition. When the Romans were on the
defensive the Angli were beyond the opportunities
of attack.</p>

<p>All attempts to illustrate the history of the
Angles of Germany by means of that of the
nations mentioned in conjunction with them by
Tacitus, is <i>obscurum per obscurius</i>. It is more
than this. The connexion creates difficulties. The
Langobardi, who gave their name to Lombardy,
were anything but Angle; inasmuch as their language
was a dialect of the High German division.
Hence, if we connect them with our own ancestors
we must suppose that when they changed
their locality they changed their speech also.
But no such assumption is necessary. All that
we get from the text of Tacitus is, that they
were in geographical contiguity with the Reudigni,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The Varini are in a different predicament.
They are mentioned in the present text along
with the Angli, and they are similarly mentioned
in the heading of a code of laws referred
to the tenth century. Every name in this latter
document is attended with difficulties.</p>

<p><i>Incipit Lex Anglorum et Werinorum, hoc est
Thuringorum.</i>&mdash;To find <i>Angli</i> in Thuringia by
themselves would be strange. So it would be
to find <i>Werini</i>. But to find the two combined<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
is exceedingly puzzling. I suggest the likelihood
of there having been military colonies,
settled by some of the earlier successors of Charlemagne,
if not by Charlemagne himself. There
are other interpretations; but this seems the
likeliest. That the Varini and Angli were contiguous
populations in the time of Tacitus, joining
each other on the Lower Elbe, even as they
join each other in his text, is likely. It is also
likely that when their respective areas were conquered,
each should have supplied the elements
of a colony to the conqueror.</p>

<p>At the same time, I do not think that their
ethnological relations were equally close. The
Varini I believe to have been Slavonians. There
is no difficulty in doing this. The only difficulty
lies in the choice between two Slavonic populations.
Adam of Bremen places a tribe, which he
sometimes calls <i>Warnabi</i>, and sometimes <i>Warnahi</i>
(Helmoldus calling it <i>Warnavi</i>), between
the river Havel in Brandenburg and the Obotrites
of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He mentions
them, too, in conjunction with the <i>Linones</i> of
<i>Lun</i>-eburg. Now this evidence fixes them in the
parts about the present district of <i>Warnow</i>, on
the Elde, a locality which is further confirmed by
two chartas of the latter part of the twelfth century&mdash;"silva
qu&aelig; destinguit terras Havelliere
scilicet et Muritz, eandem terram quoque Muritz<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
et Vepero cum terminis suis ad terram <i>Warnowe</i>
ex utraque parte fluminis quod Eldene dicitur
usque ad castrum Grabow." Also&mdash;"distinguit
tandem terram Moritz et Veprouwe cum omnibus
terminis suis ad terram qu&aelig; <i>Warnowe</i> vocatur,
includens et terram <i>Warnowe</i> cum terminis suis
ex utraque parte fluminis quod Eldena dicitur
usque ad castrum quod Grabou vocatur." Such
is one of the later populations of the parts on the
Lower Elbe, which may claim to represent the
Varini of Tacitus.</p>

<p>But the name re-appears. In the Life of Bishop
Otto, the Isle of Rugen is called <i>Verania</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and
the population <i>Verani</i>&mdash;eminent for their paganism.
To reconcile these two divisions of the
Mecklenburg populations is a question for the
Slavonic arch&aelig;ologist. Between the two we get
some light for the ethnology of the Varini. <i>Their</i>
island is <i>Rugen</i> rather than Heligoland. The
island, however, that best suits the Angli is <i>Heligoland</i>
rather than Rugen. Which is which?
The following hypothesis has already been suggested.
"What if the Varini had one <i>holy island</i>,
and the Angli another&mdash;so that the <i>insul&aelig; sacr&aelig;</i>,
with their corresponding <i>casta nemora</i>, were two
in number?" I submit that a writer with no better
means of knowing the exact truth than Tacitus,
might, in such a case, when he recognized<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the <i>insular</i> character common to the two forms
of <i>cultus</i>, easily and pardonably, refer them to one
and the same island; in other words, he might
know the general fact that the <i>Angli</i> and <i>Varini</i>
worshipped in an island, without knowing the
particular fact of their each having a separate
one.</p>

<p>This is what really happened; so that the hypothesis
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The truly and undoubtedly Germanic <i>Angli</i>
worshipped in Heligoland.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The probably Slavonic Varini worshipped in
the Isle of Rugen.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <i>holy island</i> of Tacitus is that of the
Angli&mdash;</p>

<p><i>d.</i> With whom the <i>Varini</i> are inaccurately
associated&mdash;</p>

<p><i>e.</i> The source of the inaccuracy lying in the
fact of that nation having a <i>holy island</i>, different
from that of the Angles, but not known to be so.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>We have got now, in the text of Tacitus, the
Angli as a Germanic, and the Varini as a Slavonic,
population. The Langobardi may be left unnoticed
for the present. But round which of the
two are the remaining tribes to be grouped, the
Reudigni, the Aviones, Eudoses, the Suardones,
and Nuithones.</p>

<p><i>The Reudigni.</i>&mdash;Whether we imagine the Latin<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
form before us to represent such a word as the
German Reud-<i>ing-as</i>, or the Slavonic Reud-<i>inie</i><a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
(of either of which it may be the equivalent), the
two last syllables are inflexional; the first only
belonging to the root. Now, although unknown
to any Latin writer but Tacitus, the syllable <i>Reud</i>
as the element of a compound, occurs in the Icelandic
Sagas. Whoever the Goths of Scandinavia
may have been, they fell into more than one class.
There were, for instance, the simple <i>Goths</i> of <i>Got</i>-land,
the <i>island</i> Goths of <i>Ey-gota</i>-land, and,
thirdly, the Goths of <i>Reidh-gota</i>-land. Where
was this? Reidhgotaland was an old name of
<i>Jutland</i>. Reidhgotaland was also the name of
a country <i>east of Poland</i>. Zeuss<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> well suggests
that these conflicting facts may be reconciled by
considering the prefix <i>Reidh</i>, to denote the Goths
of the <i>Continent</i> in opposition to the word <i>Ey</i>,
denoting the Goths of the <i>Islands</i>; both being
formidable and important nations, both being in
political and military relations to the Danes,
Swedes, and Norwegians, and both being other
than Germanic.</p>

<p>In the Traveller's Song a more remarkable compound
is found; <i>Hreth</i>-king&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;">
<span class="i0">He with Ealhild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faithful peace-weaver,<br /></span>
<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span><span class="i0">For the first time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the <i>Hreth</i>-king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought the home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>East of Ongle</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Eormenric,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fierce faith-breaker.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Now, although the usual notions respecting the
locality of the great Gothic empire of Hermanric
are rather invalidated than confirmed by this extract,
the relation between the <i>Hreths</i> and <i>Ongle</i>
is exactly that between the <i>Reudigni</i> and <i>Angli</i>.
Neither are there other facts wanting which
would bring the rule of Hermanric as far north
as the latitude of the Angli, though not, perhaps,
so far east. His death is said to have been occasioned
by the revolt of two <i>Rhoxalanian</i> princes.
Now the Rhoxalani were, at least, as far north
as the Angli, however much farther they may
have lain eastwards.</p>

<p>But in the same poem we meet with the name
in the simple form <i>Hr&aelig;d</i>; for, when we remember
that one of the Icelandic notices of Reidhgotaland
is that it lay to <i>the east of Poland</i>, we
may fairly infer that Reidhgotaland was the
country of the nation mentioned in the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 13em;">
<span class="i0">Eadwine I sought and Elsa,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&AElig;gelmund and Hungar,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wulfhere I sought and Wyrnhere;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their ancient native seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the folk of &AElig;tla.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Such faint light then as can be thrown upon
the Reudigni of Tacitus disconnects them with
the Angli both geographically and ethnologically,
connecting them with the Prussians, and placing
them on the Lower Vistula.</p>

<p><i>The Aviones.</i>&mdash;The Aviones are either unknown
to history, or known under the slightly
modified form of <i>Chaviones</i>. Maximian conquers
them about <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 289. His Panegyrist Mamertinus
associates them with the Heruli. Perhaps,
the <i>Obii</i> are the same people. If so, they cross
the Danube in conjunction with the Langobardi,
and are mentioned, as having done so, by Petrus
Patricius.</p>

<p>The <i>Eudoses</i> will be noticed when Ptolemy's
list comes under consideration.</p>

<p>So will the <i>Suardones</i>.</p>

<p>No light has ever been thrown on the <i>Nuithones</i>.</p>

<p>Over and above the Saxons, to whom a special
chapter will be devoted, <i>Ptolemy's</i> list contains:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>The Sigulones.</i>&mdash;The Saxons lay to the
north of Elbe, on the neck of the Chersonese, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the Sigulones occupied the Chersonese itself, westwards.
Two populations thus placed between the
Atlantic and the Baltic, immediately north of the
Elbe, leave but little room for each other.</p>

<p>"Then," writes Ptolemy, "come&mdash;</p>

<p>"2. <i>The Sabalingii.</i>&mdash;then&mdash;</p>

<p>"3. <i>The Kobandi.</i>&mdash;above these&mdash;</p>

<p>"4. <i>The Chali.</i>&mdash;and above them, but more to the west&mdash;</p>

<p>"5. <i>The Phundusii.</i>&mdash;more to the east&mdash;</p>

<p>"6. <i>The Charudes.</i>&mdash;and most to the north of all&mdash;</p>

<p>"7. <i>The Cimbri.</i>"</p>

<p>8. <i>The Pharodini</i> lay next to the Saxons, between
the Rivers Chalusus and Suebus.</p>

<p>Tacitus' geography is obscure; Ptolemy's is difficult.
One wants light. The other gives us
conflicting facts. Neither have the attempts to
reconcile them been successful. The first point
that strikes us is the difference of the names in
the two authors. No Sigulones and Sabalingii in
Tacitus. No Nuithones and Reudigni in Ptolemy.
Then there is the extremely northern position
which the latter gives the Cimbri. His Charudes,
too, cannot well be separated from C&aelig;sar's Harudes.
Nevertheless, their area is inconveniently
distant from the seat of war in the invasion of
Gaul under Ariovistus, of whose armies the Harudes
form a part. The River Chalusus is reasonably<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
considered to be the Trave. But the
Suebus is not the Oder; though the two are often
identified: inasmuch as the geographer continues
to state that after the Pharodini come "the Sidini
to the river Iadua" (the Oder?), "and, after
them, the Rutikleii as far as the Vistula."</p>

<p>Zeuss has allowed himself to simplify some of
the details by identifying certain of the Ptolem&aelig;an
names with those of Tacitus. Thus he
thinks that, by supposing the original word to
have been <span title="Spharod-inoi">&#931;&#966;&#945;&#961;&#8057;&#948;-&#953;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span>, the <span title="Pharodin-oi">&#934;&#945;&#961;&#8057;&#948;&#953;&#957;-&#959;&#953;</span> and <i>Suardon</i>-es
may be made the same. <i>Kobandi</i>, too, he
thinks may be reduced to <i>Chaviones</i>, or <i>Aviones</i>.
Thirdly, by the prefix <span title="Ph">&#934;</span>, and the insertion of N,
<i>Eudos</i>-es may be converted into <span title="Phoundous-ioi">&#934;&#959;&#965;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#8166;&#963;-&#953;&#959;&#953;</span>.</p>

<p>Those who know the degree to which the modern
German philologists act upon the doctrine
that <i>Truth is stranger than Fiction</i>, and, by
unparallelled manipulations reconcile a so-called
iron-bound system of scientific letter-changes
with results as extraordinary as those of the Keltic
and Hebraic dreamers of the last century, will
see in such comparisons as these nothing extraordinary.
On the contrary, they will give them
credit for being moderate. And so they are: for
it is extremely likely that whilst Tacitus got his
names from German, Ptolemy got <i>his</i> from Keltic,
or Slavonic, sources; and if such be the case,
a very considerable latitude is allowable.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, even if we make the Cobandi, Aviones;
the Phundusii, Eudoses; and the Pharodini, Suardones
(probably, also, the <i>Sweordwere</i>, of the
Traveller's Song), the geographical difficulties are
still considerable. Saxons on the neck of the
Chersonese (say in Stormar) with Sigulones (say
in Holstein) to the west of them are fully sufficient
to stretch from sea to sea; but <i>beyond</i> (and
this we must suppose to be in a <i>westerly</i> direction)
are the Sabalingii, and then the Kobandi;
above (north of) these the Chali (whom we should
expect to be connected with the river Chalusus),
and west of these the Phundusii. Similar complications
can easily be added.</p>

<p>The meaning of the word <i>Sabalingii</i> is explained,
if we may assume a slight change in the
reading. How far it is legitimate, emendatory
critics may determine; but by transposing the
B and L, the word becomes <i>Sa-lab</i>-ingii. The
Slavonic is the tongue that explains this.</p>

<p>1. The Slavonic name of the <i>Elbe</i> is <i>Laba</i>;
and&mdash;</p>

<p>2. The Slavonic for <i>Transalbian</i>, as a term for
the population <i>beyond the Elbe</i>, would be <i>Sa-lab-ingii</i>.
This compound is common. The Finns
of Karelia are called <i>Za-volok-ian</i>, because they
live beyond the <i>volok</i> or <i>watershed</i>. The Kossacks
of the Dnieper are called <i>Za-porog-ian</i>,
because they live beyond the <i>porog</i> or <i>waterfall</i>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
The population in question I imagine to have
been called <i>Sa-lab-ingian</i>, because they lived
beyond the Laba, or Elbe.</p>

<p>Now a name closely akin to <i>Salabingian</i> actually
occurs at the beginning of the Historical
period. The population of the Duchy of Lauenburg
is (then) Slavonic. So is that of south-eastern
Holstein; since the Saxon area begins with
the district of Stormar. So is that of Luneburg.
And the name of these Slavonians of the Elbe
is <i>Po-lab-ingii</i> (<i>on the Elbe</i>), just as <i>Po-mor-ania</i>
is the country <i>on the sea</i>. Of the <i>Po</i>-labingians,
then, the <i>Sa</i>-labingii were the section belonging
to that side of the Elbe to which the tribe that
used the term did <i>not</i> belong. Such are the
reasons for believing the name to be Slavonic.</p>

<p>There are specific grounds, of more or less value,
then, for separating the Angli from, at least, the
following populations&mdash;the Varini, the Reudigni,
the Eudoses, the Phundusii, the Suardones, the
Pharodini, and the Sabalingii (Salabingii?); indeed,
the Sigulones and Harudes seem to be the
only Germans of two lists. The former, I think,
was Frisian rather than Angle, the latter <i>Old</i>
Saxon rather than Anglo-Saxon; for, notwithstanding
some difficulties of detail which will be
noticed in another chapter, the <i>Charudes</i> must
be considered the Germans of the <i>Hartz</i>. The
Sigulones, being placed so definitely to the <i>west</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of the Saxons, were probably the Nordalbingians
of Holsatia.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The last complication which will be noticed is
in the following extract from Ptolemy.&mdash;"But of
the inland nations far in the interior the greatest
are that of the <i>Suevi Angeili</i>, who are east of
the Longobardi, stretching to the north, as far as
the middle parts of the river Elbe, that of the
<i>Suevi Semnones</i>, who, when we leave the Elbe,
reach from the aforesaid (middle) parts, eastwards,
as far as the River Su&ecirc;bus, and that of
the Bugunt&aelig; next in succession, extending as far
as the Vistula."&mdash;Lib. ii. c. xi.</p>

<p>This connexion of the Angles with the Suevi
requires notice; though it should not cause any
serious difficulty. The term <i>Suevi</i>, or <i>Suevia</i>,
is used in a very extensive signification, denoting
the vast tracts east of the better known districts
of Germany; and in a similar sense it is used by
both Tacitus and C&aelig;sar. The notion of any
specific connection with the <i>Suevi</i> of Suabia is
unnecessary.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that in the Traveller's
Song the Kingdom of Hermanric is placed
<i>east of Ongle</i>. Either this means that the one
country was east of the other, in the way that
Hungary is east of the Rhine, or else an unrecognized<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
extension must be given to one of the
two areas.</p>

<p>In one part of the poem in question the form
is not <i>Ongle</i> but <i>Engle</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;">
<span class="i0">"Mid <i>E</i>nglum ic w&aelig;s, and mid Sw&aelig;fum&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With <i>E</i>ngles I was, and with Sueves."&mdash;<i>Line</i> 121.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The result of the previous criticism is&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the Angli of Germany distinguished,
by the use of that form of speech which afterwards
became Anglo-Saxon, from the Slavonians
of south-eastern Holstein, Lauenburg, Luneburg,
and Altmark, from the Old Saxons of Westphalia,
and from the Frisians of the sea-coast between
the Ems and Elbe, occupied, with the exceptions
just suggested, the northern two-thirds
of the present Kingdom of Hanover.</p>

<p>2. That they were the only members of the
particular section of the German population to
which they belonged, <i>i.e.</i>, the section using the
Anglo-Saxon rather than the Old Saxon speech.</p>

<p>Their relations to the population of the Cimbric
Chersonese will form the subject of the next
chapter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ethnologist of England has to deal with
a specific section of those numerous Germans,
who, in different degrees of relationship to each
other, have been known, at different times, under
the name of <i>Saxon</i>; a name which has by no
means a uniform signification, a name which has
been borne by every single division and subdivision
of the Teutonic family, the Proper
Goths alone excepted. At present, however, he
only knows that the counties of Es-<i>sex</i>, Sus-<i>sex</i>,
and Middle-<i>sex</i> are the localities of the East-<i>Saxons</i>,
the South-<i>Saxons</i>, and the Middle-<i>Saxons</i>,
respectively; that in the sixth and
seventh centuries there was a Kingdom of Wes-<i>sex</i>,
or the West-<i>Saxons</i>; that <i>Angle</i> and <i>Saxon</i>
were nearly convertible terms; and that Anglo-<i>Saxon</i>
is the name of the English Language in
its oldest known stage. How these names came
to be so nearly synonymous, or how certain
south-eastern counties of England and a German<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Kingdom on the frontier of Bohemia, bear
names so much alike as Sus-<i>sex</i> and <i>Sax</i>-ony,
are questions which he has yet to solve.</p>

<p>The German Kingdom of Saxony may be disposed
of first. It is chiefly in name that it has
any relation to the Saxon parts of England. In
language and blood there are numerous points of
difference. The original population was Slavonic,
which began to be displaced by Germans
from the left bank of the Saale as early as the
seventh century; possibly earlier. The language
of these Slavonians was spoken in the neighbourhood
of Leipsic as late as the fourteenth century,
and at the present time two populations in Silesia
and Lusatia still retain it&mdash;the Srbie, and
Srskie. Sorabi, Milcieni, Siusli, and Lusicii, are
the designations of these populations in the time
of Charlemagne; and, earlier still, they were included
in the great name of Semnones. It is only
because they were conquered from that part of
Germany which was called <i>Saxonia</i> or <i>Saxenland</i>,
or else because numerous colonies of the
previously reduced Saxons of the Lower Weser
were planted on their territory, that their present
name became attached to them. Slavonic
in blood, and High German in language, the
Saxons of the Upper Elbe, or the Saxons of
Upper Saxony, are but remotely connected with
the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons of Britain.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>In Upper Saxony, at least, the name is not
native.</p>

<p><i>Lower</i> Saxony was the country on the <i>Lower</i>
Elbe, and also of the <i>Lower</i> Weser, and until
the extension of the name to the parts about
Leipsic and Dresden, was simply known as
<i>Saxonia</i>, or the Land of the <i>Saxones</i>; at least,
the qualifying adjective <i>Lower</i> made no part
of the designation. <i>Saxony</i> was what it was
called by the Merovingian Franks, as well as the
Carlovingians who succeeded them. Whether,
however, any portion of the <i>indigen&aelig;</i> so called
itself is uncertain. In the latter half of the
eighth century it falls into three divisions, two
of which are denoted by geographical or political
designations, and one by the name of a native
population.</p>

<p>The present district of <i>West</i>-phalia was one
of them; its occupants being called <i>West</i>-falahi,
<i>West</i>-falai, <i>West</i>-fali. These were the Saxons of
the Rhine. Contrasted with these, the <i>East</i>-phalians
(<i>Ost</i>-falai, <i>Ost</i>-falahi, <i>Ost</i>-fali, <i>Oster</i>-leudi,
<i>Austre</i>-leudi, <i>Aust</i>-rasii), stretched towards the
Elbe.</p>

<p>Between the two, descendants of the <i>Angri</i>-varii
of Tacitus, and ancestors of the present
Germans of the parts about <i>Engern</i>, lay the
<i>Angr</i>-arii, or <i>Ang</i>-arii.</p>

<p>An unknown poet of the eighth century, but<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
one whose sentiments indicate a Saxon origin,
thus laments the degenerate state of his country:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 20em;">
<span class="i0">"Generalis habet populos divisio ternos,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insignita quibus Saxonia floruit olim;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Patria Francorum terris sociatur ab Austro,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oceanoque eadem conjungitur ex Aquilone."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>The conquest of Charlemagne is the reason
for the language being thus querulous; for, unlike
Upper Saxony, the Saxony of the Lower
Weser, the Saxony of the Angrivarii, Westfalii,
and Ostfalii, was truly the native land of an old
and heroic <i>German</i> population, of a population
which under Arminius had resisted Rome, of a
population descended from the Chamavi, the Dulgubini,
the Fosi, and the Cherusci of Tacitus, and,
finally, the land of a population whose immediate
and closest affinities were with the Angles of
Hanover, and the Frisians of Friesland, rather
than with the Chatti of Hesse, or the Franks of
the Carlovingian dynasty.</p>

<p>How far are these the Saxons of Sus-<i>sex</i>, Es-<i>sex</i>,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and Middle-<i>sex</i>? Only so far as they were
Angles; and, except in the parts near the Elbe,
they were other than Angle. This we know from
their language, in which a Gospel Harmony, in
alliterative metre, a fragmentary translation of
the Psalms, and a heroic rhapsody called Hildubrant
and Hathubrant have come down to us.</p>

<p>The parts where the dialects of these particular
specimens were spoken are generally considered
to have been the country about Essen, Cleves,
and Munster; and, although closely allied to the
Anglo-Saxon of England, the Westphalian Saxon
is still a notably different form of speech. It was
the Angle language in its southern variety, or
(changing the expression) the Angle was the most
northern form of it.</p>

<p>We have seen that <i>Saxony</i> and <i>Saxon</i> were no
native terms on the Upper Elbe. Were they so in
the present area&mdash;in Westphalia, Eastphalia, and
the land of the Angrivarii? Tacitus knows no
such name at all; and Ptolemy, the first writer
in whom we find it, attaches it to a population of
the Cimbric Peninsula. Afterwards, in the third
and fourth centuries it is applied by the Roman
and Byzantine writers in a general sense, to those
maritime Germans whose piracies were the boldest,
and whose descents upon the Provinces of
Gaul and Britain were most dreaded. Yet nowhere
can we find a definite tract of country<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
upon which we can lay our finger and say <i>this is
the land of Saxons</i>, saving only the insignificant
district to the north of the Elbe, mentioned by
Ptolemy. From the time of Honorius to that of
Charlemagne, <i>Saxo</i> is, like <i>Franc</i>, a general term
applied, indeed, to the maritime Germans rather
than those of the interior, and to those of the
north rather than the south, yet nowhere specifically
attached to any definite population with a
local habitation and a name to match. Whenever
we come to detail, the Saxons of the Roman
writers become Chamavi, Bructeri, Cherusci,
Chauci, or Frisii; while the Frank details are
those of the Ostphali, Westphali, and Angrivarii.</p>

<p>But the Frank writers under the Merovingian
and Carlovingian dynasties are neither the only
nor the earliest authors who speak of the Hanoverians
and Westphalians under the general name
of <i>Saxon</i>. The Christianized Angles of England
used the same denomination; and, as early as the
middle of the eighth century, Beda mentions the
Fresones, Rugini, Dani, Huni, <i>Antiqui Saxones</i>,
Boructuarii.&mdash;<i>Hist. Eccles.</i> 5, 10. Again&mdash;the
Boructuarii, descendants of the nearly exterminated
Bructeri of Tacitus, and occupants of the
country on the Lower Lippe, are said to have been
reduced by the nation of the <i>Old Saxons</i> (<i>a gente
Antiquorum Saxonum</i>). In other records we
find the epithet <i>Antiqui</i> translated by the native<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
word <i>eald</i> (=<i>old</i>) and the formation of the compound
<i>Altsaxones</i>&mdash;Gregorius Papa universo populo
provinci&aelig; <i>Altsaxonum</i> (vita St. Boniface).
Lastly, the Anglo-Saxon writers of England use
the term <i>Eald-Seaxan</i> (=<i>Old-Saxon</i>). And this
form is current amongst the scholars of the present
time; who call the language of the <i>Heliand</i>,
of the so-called <i>Carolinian Psalms</i> and of <i>Hildebrant
and Hathubrant</i>, the <i>Old</i>-Saxon, in contradistinction
to the <i>Anglo</i>-Saxon of Alfred, C&aelig;dmon,
and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. The authority
of the Anglo-Saxons themselves justifies
this compound; yet it is by no means unexceptionable.
Many a writer has acquiesced in the
notion that the Old-Saxon was neither more nor
less than the Anglo-Saxon in a continental locality,
and the Anglo-Saxon but the Old-Saxon
transplanted into England. Again&mdash;the Old-Saxons
have been considered as men who struck,
as with a two-edged sword, at Britain on the one
side, and at Upper Saxony on the other, so that
the Saxons of Leipsic and the Saxons of London
are common daughters of one parent&mdash;the Saxons
of Westphalia.</p>

<p>The exact relations, however, to the Old-Saxons
and the Anglo-Saxons seem to have been as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The so-called Old-Saxon is the old <i>Westphalian</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The so-called Anglo-Saxon the old <i>Hanoverian</i>
population.</p>

<p>Their languages were sufficient alike to be mutually
intelligible, and after the conversion of
the Angles of England, who became Christianized
about <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 600, the extension of their own creed
to the still Pagan Saxons of the Continent became
one of the great duties to the bishops and
missionaries of Britain; who, although themselves
of Hanoverian rather than Westphalian extraction,
looked upon the whole stock at large as
their parentage, and called their cousins (so to
say) in Westphalia, and their brothers in Hanover,
by the collective term <i>Old-Saxon</i>.</p>

<p>All the Angles, then, of the <i>Saxonia</i> of the
Frank and British writers of the eighth century
were Saxon, though all the Saxons were not
Angle.</p>

<p>Eastphalia, the division which must have been
the most <i>Angle</i>, reached as far as the Elbe.</p>

<p>But there was, also, a Saxony beyond Eastphalia,
a Saxony beyond the Elbe; the country
of the <i>Saxones Transalbiani</i>; other names
for its occupants being <i>Nord-albingi</i> (=<i>men to
the north of the Elbe</i>), and Nord-leudi (=<i>North
people</i>). The poet already quoted, writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;">
<span class="i0">Saxonum populus quidam, quos claudit ab Austro<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albis sejunctim positos Aquilonis ad axem.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hos <i>Nordalbingos</i> patrio sermone vocamus.<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>In this case as before, <i>Saxon</i> is a generic rather
than a particular name. The facts that prove
this give us also the geographical position of the
Nordalbingians. They fell into three divisions:</p>

<p>1. The <i>Thiedmarsi</i>, <i>Thiatmarsgi</i>, or <i>Ditmarshers</i>,
whose capital was Meldorp&mdash;<i>primi ad
Oceanum Thiatmarsgi</i>, et eorum <i>ecclesia Mildindorp</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>2. The <i>Holsati</i>, <i>Holtzati</i>, or <i>Holts&aelig;tan</i>, from
whom the present Duchy of Holstein takes its
name&mdash;<i>dicti a sylvis, quas incolunt</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The river
Sturia separated the Holsatians from&mdash;</p>

<p>3. The <i>Stormarii</i>, or people of <i>Stormar</i>; of
whom Hamburg was the capital&mdash;<i>Adam Bremens</i>:
<i>Hist. Eccles.</i> c. 61.</p>

<p>These are the Nordalbingians of the eighth
century. Before we consider their relations to
the Westphalian and Hanoverian Saxons the
details of the present ethnology of the Cimbric
Peninsula are necessary. At the present moment
Holstein, Stormar, and Ditmarsh are Low German,
or Platt-Deutsch, districts; the High German
being taught in the schools much as English
is taught in the Scotch Highlands. Eydersted
also is Low German, and so are the southern
and eastern parts of Sleswick. Not so, however,
the western. Facing the Atlantic, we find an<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
interesting population, isolated in locality, and
definitely stamped with old and original characteristics.
They are as different from the Low
Germans on the one side as the Dutch are from
the English; and they are as little like the Danes
on the other. They are somewhat bigger and
stronger than either; at least both Danes and
Germans may be found who own to their being
<i>bigger if not better</i>. They shew, too, a greater
proportion of blue eyes and flaxen locks; though
these are common enough on all sides. That
breadth of frame out of which has arisen the epithet
<i>Dutch-built</i>, is here seen in its full development;
with a sevenfold shield of thick woollen
petticoats to set it of. So that there are characteristics,
both of dress and figure, which sufficiently
distinguish the <i>North-Frisian</i> of Sleswick
from the Dane on one side and the German
on the other.</p>

<p>It is only, however, in the more inaccessible
parts of their country that the <i>differenti&aelig;</i> of
dress rise to the dignity of a separate and independent
<i>costume</i>. They do so, however, in some
of those small islands which lie off the coast of
Sleswick; three of which are supposed to have
been the <i>three islands of the Saxons</i>, in the
second and third centuries. A party, which the
writer fell in with, from <i>F&ouml;hr</i>, were all dressed
alike, all in black, all in woollen, with capes over<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the heads instead of bonnets. "Those," says the
driver, who was himself half Dane and half German,
"are from F&ouml;hr. They have been to Flensburg
to see one of their relations. He is a sailor.
They are all sailors in F&ouml;hr. Some of them, perhaps,
smugglers&mdash;they all dress so&mdash;I can't speak
to them&mdash;my brother can&mdash;he has been in England,
and an Englishman can talk to them&mdash;they
talk half Danish and half Platt-Deutsch, and
half English&mdash;more than half. They were Englishmen
once&mdash;a good sort of people&mdash;took no
part in the war&mdash;did not much care for the
Danes, though the Danes took pains to persuade
them&mdash;so did the Germans, but they did not much
care for the Germans either&mdash;strong men&mdash;good
soldiers&mdash;good sailors&mdash;Englishmen, but not like
the Englishmen I've seen myself. My brother's
been in London and America, and can talk with
them."</p>

<p>What is thus said about their English-hood is
commonly believed by the Danes and Germans
of the Frisian localities. They are English in
some way or other, though how no one knows
exactly. And many learned men hold the same
view. It is a half-truth. They are more English,
and, at the same time, more Dutch, than any of
their neighbours; more so than either Dane or
German, but for all that they are something that
is neither English nor Dutch. They are <i>Frisians</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of the same stock as the Frisians of Friesland,
whom they resemble in form, and dress, and
manners, and speech, and temper, and history.
But from the Frisians of the south they have
been cut off for many centuries, partly by the
hand of man, partly by the powers of Nature,
partly by invasions from Germans, and partly by
overwhelming inbreaks of the Ocean. There is
a Frisian country in the south (the present
Province of Friesland), and there is a Frisian
country in the north (the tract which we are
speaking of); and these are parts of the <i>terra
firma</i>. But the Friesland that lay between the
two is lost&mdash;lost, though we know where it is.
It is at the bottom of the sea: forfeited, like the
lava-stricken plains of Sicily, of Campania, and of
Iceland, in the great game of Man against Nature&mdash;for
it is not everywhere that Man has been the
winner. The war of the Frisians against the
sea has been the war not of the Titans against
Jove, but of the Amphibii against Neptune.</p>

<p>Every Frisian&mdash;<i>Friese</i> as he calls himself&mdash;is
an agriculturist, and it is only in the villages
that the Frisian tongue is spoken. In the towns
of Ripe, Bredsted, and Husum, small as they are,
there is nothing but Danish and German. But
in all the little hamlets between, the well-built
old-fashioned farm-houses, with gable-ends of vast
breadth, and massive thatched roofs that make<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
two-thirds of the height of the house, and a
stork's nest on the chimney, and a cow-house at
the end, are Frisian; and, if you can overhear
what they say amongst themselves, you find that,
without being English it is somewhat like it.
<i>Woman</i> is the word which sounds strangest to
both the German and the Dane, and, it is generally
the first instance given of the peculiarity
of the Frisian language. "Why can't they speak
properly, and say <i>Kone</i>?" says the Dane. "<i>Weib</i>
is the right word," says the German. "Who ever
says <i>woman</i>?" cry both. The language has not
been reduced to writing; indeed, the little that
has been done with it is highly discreditable to
the Sleswick-Holstein Church Establishment. It
is spoken by upwards of thirty thousand individuals;
and when we remember that the whole
population of Denmark is less than that of London
and the suburbs, we see at once that a large
proportion of it has been less heeded in respect
to its spiritualities than the Gaels and Welsh of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>You may distinguish a Frisian parish as the
Eton grammar distinguishes nouns of the neuter
gender. It is <i>omne quod exit in -um</i>; for so
end nine out of ten of the Frisian villages. Now,
throughout the whole length and breadth of
the Brekkel<i>ums</i>, and Stad<i>ums</i>, &amp;c., that lie
along the coast, from Ripe north to Hus<i>um</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
south, there is not one church service that is performed
in Frisian, or half-a-dozen priests who
could perform it. No fraction of the Liturgy is
native; nor has it ever been so. Danish there
is, and German there is; German, too, of two
kinds&mdash;High and Low. The High German is
taught in the schools, and that well; so well,
that nowhere are the answers of the little children
more easily understood by such travellers
as are not over strong in their language than in
the <i>Friese</i> country. Nevertheless, it is but a
well-taught lesson; and by no means excuses the
neglect of the native idiom.</p>

<p>As things are at present, this is, perhaps, all for
the best. The complaint lies against the original
neglect of the Frisian; and its <i>gravamen</i> is the
sad tale it so silently tells of previous centralization&mdash;by
which is meant arbitrary and unjustifiable
oppression; for at no distant time back, the
Frisians must have formed a very considerable
proportion of the Sleswickers, and, at the beginning
of the Historical period, the majority. And
yet it was not thought of Christianizing them
through their own tongue; a tongue which, because
it has never been systematically reduced to
writing, conscientious clergymen say is incapable
of being written. As if the Frisian of Friesland,
the Frisian of the south, had not been the language
of law and poetry for more than eight<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
hundred years, and, as if it were a bit harder to
write, or print, the northern dialect of the same,
than it was for Scotland to have a literature.
For the tongue is no growth of yesterday. It
may, possibly, be as much older as any other
tongue of the Peninsula as the Welsh is older
than the English. That it is older than some
of them is certain. Amateur investigators of it
there are, of course. Outzen, the pastor of Brekkelum,
was the father of them; and honourable
mention is due to the present clergyman in Hacksted.
As a general rule, however, the religion of
Sleswick has been centralized.</p>

<p>The literature, as far as it has been collected,
consists of a wedding-song of the fifteenth century,
to be found in Camerarius, with addition of, perhaps,
a dozen such <i>morceaux</i> as the following approaches
to song, epigram, and ballad, respectively.</p>

<p>This was what became of Peter; who is, perhaps,
the most legendary and heroic of the North-Frisians&mdash;so
that the development in this line
lies within a small compass.</p>

<p>The Isle of Nordstand is Low German (Platt-Deutsch)
in language, but in blood and pedigree
is Frisian; as, indeed, it was in speech up to <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span>
1610. Then came a great inundation, which destroyed
half the cattle of the island, and beggared
its inhabitants; who were removed by their hard-hearted
lord the Count of Gottorp to the continent,
and replaced by Low Germans.</p>

<p>The island of Pelvorm is in the same category
with Nordstand, the population being essentially
Frisian though the Platt-Deutsch form of speech
has replaced the native dialect; which was spoken
in both islands <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1639.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Amrom partially preserves it; though the Frisian
character is less marked than in&mdash;</p>

<p><i>F&ouml;hr.</i>&mdash;Here all the names which in English
would end in -<i>ham</i>, in High German in -<i>heim</i>, in
Low German in -<i>hem</i>, and in Danish in -<i>by</i> (as
Threking-<i>ham</i>, Mann-<i>heim</i>, Arn-<i>hem</i>, Wis-<i>by</i>)
take the form in -<i>um</i>, the vowel being changed
into <i>u</i>-, and the <i>h</i>- being omitted, as Duns-<i>um</i>,
Utters-<i>um</i>, Midl-<i>um</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;and this is a sure sign
of Frisian occupancy. In F&ouml;hr, too, the language
is still current.</p>

<p>Of <i>Sylt</i>, the southern part has its names in the
Frisian form; as Horn-<i>um</i>, Mors-<i>um</i>, &amp;c. The
northern half, however, is Danish, and the villages
end in -<i>by</i>.</p>

<p>Such is the present area of North-Frisians;
which we shall see lies north of that of the Nordalbingians.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the present writer believes that,
either there was no difference whatever between
the Angles and the Saxons, or that the Saxons
were North-Frisians.</p>

<p>Let us, for a while, allow the name <i>Saxon</i> to be
so little conclusive as to the ethnological position
of these same Nordalbingians as to leave the
question open.</p>

<p>The first fact that meets us is the existence of
the Frisians of Holland not only south of the
Elbe but south of Weser.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>East Friesland, as its name shews, is Frisian
also; although, with a few exceptional localities
in the very fenny districts, the language has been
replaced by the German.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, too, its sanctity in the eyes
of the Angle worshipper of the Goddess Hertha,
Heligoland at the beginning of the Historical
period was not exactly Angle. It was what the
opposite coast was&mdash;Frisian. And Oldenburg
was Frisian as well; indeed the whole area occupied
by the two great nations of antiquity&mdash;the
Frisii and Chauci&mdash;was neither Old-Saxon nor
Angle-Saxon. It differed from each rather more
than they differed from each other, and, accordingly,
constituted a separate variety of the German
tongue.</p>

<p>So that there were, and are, two Frisian areas,
one extending no farther north than the Elbe,
and the other extending no farther south than
the Eyder.</p>

<p>And between these two lies that of the Nordalbingians.
This alone is <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> evidence
of their being Frisian; for we should certainly
argue that if Norfolk and Essex were English,
Suffolk was English also. Of course, it might
not be so: as intrusion and displacement might
have taken place; but intrusion and displacement
are not to be too lightly and gratuitously
assumed. The Frisian of Oldenburg can be traced<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
up to the Elbe, and the Frisian of Sleswick can
be followed down to the Eyder.</p>

<p>Eydersted, however, and Holstein are Low
German. Were they always so? Of Eydersted,
Jacob Sax, himself a Low German of the district,
writes, <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1610, that "the inhabitants besides
the Saxon, use their own extraordinary natural
speech, which is the same as the East and West
Frisian."</p>

<p>For Ditmarsh the evidence is inconclusive. But
one or two names end in -<i>um</i>.</p>

<p>As early as <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1452 the following inscription
which was found on a font in Pelvorm was <i>un</i>-intelligible
to the natives of Ditmarsh, who carried
it off&mdash;"disse hirren D&ouml;pe de have wi th&ouml;n
ewigen Ohnthonken mage lete, da schollen &ouml;sse
Berrne in kressent warde"="this here dip (font)
we have let be made as an everlasting remembrance:
there shall our bairns be christened in
it." Clemens translates this into the present
Frisian of Amrom, which runs thus&mdash;"thas hirr
d&ouml;p di ha wi tun iwagen Unthonken mage leat,
thiar skell &uuml;s Biarner un krassent wurd." Still,
Clemens thinks that the dress and domestic utensils
of the present Ditmarshers are more Frisian
than Platt-Deutsch. Now whatever the ancient
tongue of Ditmarsh may have been, it was not
the present Platt-Deutsch; yet, if it were Frisian,
it had become obsolete before <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1452.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>That we are justified in assuming an original
continuity between the North and South Frisian
areas may readily be admitted. There are, of
course, reasonable objections against it&mdash;the want
of proof of Frisian character of the language of
Ditmarsh being the chief. Still, the principle
which would lead us to predicate of Suffolk what
we had previously predicated of Norfolk and
Essex, induces us to do the same with the district
in question, and to argue that if Eydersted, to
the North, and the parts between Bremen and
Cuxhaven, to the South, were Frisian, Ditmarsh,
which lay between them, was Frisian also.</p>

<p>But this may have been the case without the
Nordalbingians being Frisian; since an Angle
movement, northward and westward, may easily
have taken place in the sixth, seventh, or eighth
centuries; in which case the <i>Stormarii</i>, <i>Holtsati</i>,
and <i>Ditmarsi</i> were Angle; intrusive, non-indigenous,
and, perhaps, of mixed blood&mdash;but still
Angle.</p>

<p>I am not prepared, however, to go further at
present upon this point than to a repetition of
a previous statement, viz.: that if the Saxons
of Anglo-Saxon England were other than Angles
under a different name, they were North-Frisians.</p>

<p><i>Saxony</i> and <i>Saxon</i> we have seen to be, for the
most part, general names for certain populations<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of considerable magnitude, populations which
when investigated in detail have been Ostphali,
Angrarii, Stormarii, &amp;c., &amp;c. Ptolemy alone assigns
to the word a <i>specific</i> power, and in Ptolemy
alone is the country of the Saxons the
definite circumscribed area of a special population.
Ptolemy, as has been already shewn, places the
<i>Saxons on the neck of the Chersonese</i> to the north
of the Chauci of the Elbe, and to the East of the
Sigulones&mdash;there or thereabouts in Stormar. He
also gives them three of the islands off the coasts
of Holstein and Sleswick; though it is uncertain
and unimportant which three he means. Hence,
the Saxons of Ptolemy, truly Nord-albingian, coincide
in locality with the subsequent Stormarii,
the Sigulones being similarly related to the Holsatians.
Yet neither the Saxones nor the Sigulones
may have been the ancestors to their respective
successors, any more than the Durotriges,
or Iceni of England were the ancestors to the
Anglo-Saxons of Dorsetshire and Norfolk.</p>

<p>Before this point comes under consideration we
must ask a question already suggested as to the
<i>Saxons</i> of the ninth century. Were they Frisians
or Angles?</p>

<p>Strongly impressed with the belief that no
third division of the Saxon section of the Germans
beyond that represented by the Angles of
Hanover and the Old Saxons of Westphalia can<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
be shewn to have existed or need be assumed, I
have thus limited the problem, although the third
question as to the probability of their having been
something different from either may be raised. I
also believe that the Frisians reached Sleswick by
an extension of their frontier, this being the reason
why the original continuity of their area is
assumed,&mdash;at the same time admitting the possibility
of their having come by sea, in which case
no such continuity is necessary. What we find
on the Eyder, and also on the Elbe may fairly be
supposed to have once been discoverable in the
intermediate country.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, an original continuity of the
Frisian area from Sleswick to the Elbe anterior
to the conquest of Ditmarsh and Holsatia by the
present Low German occupants to be a fair inference
from the present distribution of the North
Frisians, and the history of their known and recorded
displacements, we may ask how far it follows
that this displacement was effected by the
ancestors of the present Holsteiners; in other
words, how far it is certain that the present Holsteiners
succeeded immediately to the Frisians.
There is a question here; since the continuity
may have been broken by a population which was
itself broken-up in its turn. It may have been
broken by Angle inroads even as early as the
time of Tacitus. If so, the order of succession<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
would not be 1. Frisian, 2. Low German, but 1.
Frisian, 2. Angle or Anglo-Saxon, 3. Low German.</p>

<p>The Holsati, Stormarii, and Ditmarsi were,
most probably, <i>Angle</i>. That they were not the
ancestors of the present Low-Dutch is nearly
certain. The date is too early for this. It was
not till some time after the death of Charlemagne
that the spread of that section of the German
family reached Holstein. That they were not
Frisian is less certain, but it is inferred from the
manner in which they are mentioned by the native
poet already quoted; who, if he had considered
the Frisians to have been sufficiently Saxon
to pass under that denomination, would have
carried his Nordalbingian Saxony as far as the
most northern boundary of the North-Frisians.</p>

<p>The evidence, then, is in favour of the Nordalbingians
having been Anglo-Saxon in the ninth
century, and that under the name Stormarii,
Holsati, and Ditmarsi. Were they equally so in
the third, <i>i.e.</i>, when Ptolemy wrote, and when
the names under which he noticed them were
Saxones and Sigulones? I should not like to
say this. The encroachment upon the Frisian
area&mdash;the continuity being assumed&mdash;may not
have begun thus early. Nay, even the northward
extension of the Frisian area may not have
begun. I should not even like to say positively
that the Saxons of Ptolemy were German at all.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
They may have been Slavonians&mdash;a continuation
of the Wagrian and Polabic populations of
Eastern Holstein and Lauenburg.</p>

<p>To say, too, that Ptolemy's term <i>Saxon</i> was a
native name would be hazardous. We can only
say that when we get definite information respecting
the districts to which it applied it was <i>not</i>
so. It was no Nordalbingian name to the <i>Stormarians</i>,
no Nordalbingian name to the <i>Holsatians</i>,
no Nordalbingian name to the men of
<i>Ditmarsh</i>, no Nordalbingian name to any of the
islanders. It was no native name with any specific
import at all. It was a general name applied
to the countries in question, as it was to
many others besides; and it was the Franks who
applied it. It had been specific once; but, when
it was so, no one knew who bore it, or who gave
it. It may have been Slavonic applied to Slavonians,
or German applied to Germans, or German
applied to Slavonians, or Slavonic applied to Germans.
Which was it?</p>

<p>Who bore it? In the first instance the occupants
of the northern bank of the Elbe, and some
of the islands of the coast of Holstein and Sleswick;
men of the <i>wooded districts</i> of <i>Holt</i>-satia,
whose timber gave them the means of building
ships, and whose situation on the coast developed
the habit of using them to the annoyance of their
neighbours. This is all that can be said.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Who spread it abroad? The Romans first, the
Franks afterwards. They it was who called by
the name of <i>Saxon</i> men who never so called
themselves, <i>e.g.</i>, the Angrivarians, the Westphalians,
the Saxons of Upper Saxony.</p>

<p>How did the Romans get it? From the Kelts
of Gaul and Britain.</p>

<p>How came the Kelts by it? The usual answer
to this: that they got it from the Saxons themselves,
the Saxons being, of course, Germans.
But the main object of the present chapter has
been to shew the extremely unsatisfactory nature
of the evidence of any Germans having so called
themselves. Assuredly, if they stopped at the
present point, the reasons for believing the name
to have been native would be eminently unsatisfactory.
The best fact would be in the language
of Beda, who, as we have seen, called the Westphalians
<i>Old-Saxons</i>. But Beda often allowed
himself to use the language of his authorities,
most of whom wrote in Latin, and some of whom
were Gauls or Britons.</p>

<p>But four fresh ones can be added&mdash;</p>

<p>1. There is the element -<i>sex</i> in the names Es-<i>sex</i>,
Wes-<i>sex</i>, Sus-<i>sex</i>, and Middle-<i>sex</i>.</p>

<p>2. The name <i>Sax</i>-neot was that of a deity, whom
the Old Saxons, on their conversion to Christianity,
were compelled to foreswear. This gives us the
likelihood of its being the name of an <i>eponymus</i>.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The story about <i>nime&thorn; eowre Seaxas</i>=<i>take
your daggers</i>, and the deduction from it, that
<i>Saxons</i> meant <i>dagger-men</i>, is of no great weight;
with the present writer, at least. Still, as far as
it goes, it is something.</p>

<p>4. The Finlanders call the Germans <i>Saxon</i>.</p>

<p>The necessity of getting as far as we can into
the obscure problems connected with this word
is urgent. One part of England is more evidently
<i>Saxon</i> than another; at least, it bears
certain outward and visible signs of Saxonism
which are wanting elsewhere. What are we to
say to this? That Es-<i>sex</i> is Saxon, and, as <i>Saxon</i>,
something notably different from Suffolk which
is <i>Angle</i>? It may have been so; yet the minutest
ethnology ever applied has failed in detecting the
<i>differenti&aelig;</i>. They have, indeed, been assumed,
and an unduly broad distinction between the
dialect of Angle and the dialects of Saxon origin
has been drawn; but the distinction is unreal.
Angle <i>North</i>umberland and Saxon <i>Sus</i>sex differ
from each other, not because they are Angle and
Saxon, but because they are <i>north</i>ern and <i>south</i>ern
counties. And so on throughout. The difference
between Angle and Saxon Britain has
ever been assumed to be <i>real</i>, whereas it may be
but <i>nominal</i>.</p>

<p>Let us suppose it to be the latter, and <i>Saxon</i>
to have been the British name of the <i>Angle</i>&mdash;nothing<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
more. What do names like Sus-<i>sex</i>, &amp;c.,
indicate? Not that the population was less Angle
than elsewhere, but that it was more Roman or
British&mdash;an important distinction.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;certain Frisians are stated by Procopius
to have dwelt in Britain; though Beda
makes no mention of them. Assume, however,
that the Saxons of the latter writer were the
Frisians of the former, and all is plain and clear.
But, then, they should be more unlike the Angles
than they can be shewn to have been.</p>

<p>But why refine upon these points at all? Why,
when we admit the Nordalbingians to have been
Angle, demur to their having called themselves
Saxons? I do this because I cannot get over the
fact of the king who first decreed that his kingdom
should be called <i>Angle</i>-land having been no
<i>Angle</i> but a West-<i>Saxon</i>. That he should give
the native German name precedence over the
Roman and Keltic is likely; but that, by calling
himself and his immediate subjects <i>Saxon</i>, he
should change the name to <i>Angle</i>, is as unlikely
as that a King of Prussia should propose that
all Germany should be known as <i>Austria</i>. Of
course, if the evidence in favour of the word
<i>Saxon</i> being native was of a certain degree of
cogency, we must take the preceding improbability
as we find it; but no such cogent evidence
can be found. <i>Saxon</i> is always a name that some<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
one <i>may</i> give to some one else, never one that he
necessarily bears himself.</p>

<p>Were the conquerors, then, of Sus-<i>sex</i>, &amp;c.,
other than Nordalbingian? I do not say this.
I only say that the evidence of their coming from
the special district of Holstein does not lie in
their name. Germans from the south of the Elbe
would&mdash;according to the preceding hypothesis&mdash;have
been equally <i>Saxon</i> in the eyes of the
degenerate Romans and the corrupted Britons
whom they conquered.</p>

<p>We are still dealing with the origin of the
<i>name</i>. The Franks and Romans diffused and
generalized, the Kelts suggested, it. That the
name was Keltic is undenied and undeniable.
The Welsh and Gaels know us to the present
moment as <i>Saxons</i>, and not as <i>Englishmen</i>. The
only doubt has been as to how far it was <i>exclusively</i>
Keltic&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, non-Germanic.</p>

<p>Will the supposition of its being Keltic account
for <i>all</i> the facts connected with it? No. It will
not account for the Finlanders using it. They,
like the Kelts, call the Germans <i>Saxon</i>. This,
then, is a fresh condition to be satisfied. The
hypothesis which does this is, that the name
<i>Saxo</i> was applied by the Slavonians of the
Baltic as well as by Kelts of the coasts of Gaul
and Britain to the pirates of the neck of the
Chersonese,&mdash;the Slavonic designation being<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
adopted by the Finlanders just as the Keltic
was by the Romans.</p>

<p>And this supplies an argument in favour of the
name having been native, since a little consideration
will shew that, when two different nations
speak of a third by the same name, the <i>prim&acirc;
facie</i> evidence is in favour of the population to
whom it is applied by their neighbours applying
it to themselves also.</p>

<p>Yet this is no proof of its being German: nor
yet of the men of Wes-<i>sex</i>, &amp;c., being Nordalbingian.
All that we get from the British counties
ending in -<i>sex</i> is, that in certain parts of
the island, the British name for certain German
pirates prevailed over the native, whereas, in
others, the native prevailed over the British.</p>

<p>If this be but a trifling conclusion in respect to
its positive results, it is one of some negative
value; inasmuch, as when we have shewn that
<i>Angle</i> and <i>Saxon</i> are, to a great extent, the same
names in different languages, we have rid ourselves
of the imaginary necessity of investigating
such imaginary differences as the difference of
name, at the first view, suggests. We have also
ascertained the historical import of the spread of
the names <i>Saxon</i> and <i>Saxony</i>. They spread, not
because certain Saxons originating in a district
no bigger than the county of Rutland, bodily took
possession of vast tracts of country in Germany,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Britain, and Gaul, but because a great number
of Germans were called by the name of a small
tribe, just as the Hellenes of Thessaly, Attica, and
Peloponnesus were called by the Romans, <i>Greeks</i>.
The true <i>Gr&aelig;ci</i> were a tribe of dimensions nearly
as small in respect to the Hellenes at large as
the Saxons of Ptolemy were to the Germans in
general (perhaps, indeed, they were not Hellenic
at all); yet it was the <i>Gr&aelig;ci</i> whom the Romans
identified with the Hellenes. No one, however,
believes that the Gr&aelig;ci extended themselves to
the extent of the term <i>Gr&aelig;cia</i>. On the contrary,
every one admits that it was only the import of
the name which became enlarged. And this I
believe to have been the case with the word
<i>Saxon</i>.</p>

<p><i>Saxon</i>, then, like <i>Greek</i>, was a general name.
Nevertheless, they were specific <i>Saxons</i> just as
they were specific <i>Gr&aelig;ci</i>. These were the <i>Saxons</i>
of Ptolemy. When that author wrote, I believe
them to have been either <i>Frisian</i> or <i>Slavonians</i>,
without saying which&mdash;Frisians, if we look for
their affinities to the south of the Elbe; Slavonians,
if we seek them to the east of the Bille.</p>

<p>Between the time of Ptolemy and the end of
the fourth century, the name grew into importance,
and became a name of terror to the Romans,
Gauls, and Britons, who applied it to the
northern Germans of the sea-board in general.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The spread of the name along the sea-coast
began in the fourth century. Claudian alludes to
a naval victory over them</p>

</div>

<p>This gives them a robbing-ground as far north
as the Orkneys.</p>

<p>Ammianus notices their descent upon Gaul;
and writes that in the reign of Valentinian "Gallicanos
vero tractus Franci et <i>Saxones</i> iisdem confines,
quo quisque erumpere potuit, terra vel mari,
praedis acerbis incendiisque et captivorum funeribus
hominum violabant."</p>

<p>Again&mdash;"Valentinianus Saxones, gentem in
Oceani litoribus et paludibus inviis sitam, <i>virtute
et agilitate terribilem</i>, periculosam Romanis finibus,
eruptionem magna mole meditantes, <i>in ipsis
Francorum finibus</i> oppressit." Oros. 7, 32.</p>

<p>A victory over the Saxones at Deuso (Deutz,
opposite Cologne) is referred by more than one
of the later writers to the same reign.</p>

<p>The banks of the Loire are their next quarters,
Anjou being their chief locality, and their great
captain bearing a name of which the Latin form
was <i>Adovacrius</i>&mdash;"igitur Childericus Aurelianis
pugnas egit: <i>Adovacrius</i> vero cum <i>Saxonibus</i> Andegavos
venit ... (Aegidio) defuncto Adovacrius
de Andegavo et aliis locis obsides accepit ... Veniente

gestis, inter <i>Saxones</i> atque Romanos bellum gestum
est, sed Saxones terga vertentes multos de

<i>insulae eorum</i> cum multo populo interemto a
Francis captae atque subversae sunt ... Adovacrius
cum Childerico foedus iniit, Alamannosque
subjugarunt." id. 2, 19.</p>

<p>Of Saxons who joined the Lombards in the invasion
of Italy we also hear from the same author&mdash;"Post
h&aelig;c <i>Saxones qui cum Langobardis in
Italiam venerant</i>, iterum prorumpunt in Gallias,
... scilicet ut a Sigiberto rege collecti in loco,
unde egressi fuerant, stabilirentur ... Hi vero ad
Sigibertum regem transeuntes, in locum, unde
prius egressi fuerant, stabiliti sunt." 4, 43.</p>

<p>The best measure, however, of the Saxon piracies
is to be found in two terms, each of which has
always commanded the attention of investigators&mdash;the
names <i>Saxones Bajocassini</i> and <i>Littus
Saxonicum</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>Saxones Bajocassini</i> or the <i>Saxons of Bayeux</i>
are mentioned under that name by Gregory
of Tours (&sect;. 27. 10. 9); and in a charter of Charles
the Bald there is the notice of a <i>pagus</i> in the
same district called <i>Ot lingu&aelig;</i>. Zeuss reasonably
suggests, as an emended reading, <i>Otlinga</i>;
in which case we have one of the numerous equivalents<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of those local names which, in the modern
English, end in -<i>ing</i>, and in the Anglo-Saxon,
in -<i>ingas</i>&mdash;Palling, Notting, Horbling, Billing&mdash;&AElig;sclingas,
Gillingas, &amp;c., &amp;c. Who were these?
When we hear of Bayeux again, <i>i.e.</i>, in the tenth
century, it is alluded to as the most <i>Scandinavian</i>
or <i>Norse</i> town of Normandy, the only one indeed
where the Norse language and customs were decidedly
retained. These Saxons, then, may have
been Norsemen. But they may equally easily
have been Angles, or Frisians; since a Norse conquest
in the tenth is perfectly compatible with a
German in the fifth century; and, in Britain,
such was actually the case.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Littus Saxonicum</i> is a term in the <i>Notitia
Dignitatum</i>, which appears in three places.
In chapter xxxvi, where we have the details of
the sea-coast of Gaul, under the denomination of
the <i>Tractus Armoricanus</i>, the first officer&mdash;</p>

<p>[&sect;. 1.] Sub dispositione viri spectabilis Ducis
Tractus Armoricani et Nervicani&mdash;</p>

<p>Is&mdash;</p>

<p>[<span class="smcapl">A</span>] [1.] Tribunus Cohortis Prim&aelig; Nov&aelig; Armoric&aelig;

<p><i>b.</i> <span class="smcap">Cap.</span> xxxvii. [&sect;. 1.] Sub Dispositione viri
spectabilis Ducis Belgic&aelig; Secund&aelig;&mdash;</p>

<p>[1.] Equites Dalmat&aelig; Marcis in Littore Saxonico.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> These but give us a <i>Littus Saxonicum</i> in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Gaul. The 25th chapter supplies one for Britain,
and that with considerable detail&mdash;</p>

<p>[&sect;. 1.] Sub dispositione viri spectabilis comitis
Littoris Saxonici per Britanniam:</p>

<p>[1.] Pr&aelig;positus Numeri Fortensium Othon&aelig;.</p>

<p>[2.] Pr&aelig;positus Militum Tungricanorum Dubris,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to go through the detail.
It is sufficient to say that we find stations
at the following undoubted localities&mdash;Brancaster,
Yarmouth, Reculvers, Richborough, Dover,
Lymne, and the mouth of the Adur. Putting
this together it is safe to say that the whole line
of coast from the Wash to the Southampton water
was, in the reign of Honorius, if not earlier, a
<i>Littus Saxonicum</i>&mdash;whatever may have been the
import of that term.</p>

<p>Looking over the preceding details we find how
hazardous it would be to predicate concerning
the several populations designated as <i>Saxons</i> any
single statement beyond that of their having been
pirates from the north-German sea-board. Some
may have been Angle, some Frisian, some Platt-Deutsch,
some Scandinavian. Nay, the name
<i>Adovacrius</i>=<i>Odoacer</i>=<i>Ottocar</i>, may have belonged
to a Slavonian captain, whatever may have
been the country of the crew.</p>

<div class="bk1"><p>THE ANGLES OF GERMANY&mdash;IMPERFECT RECONSTRUCTION OF THEIR
HISTORY&mdash;THEIR HEROIC AGE.&mdash;BEOWULF.&mdash;CONQUEST OF ANGLEN.&mdash;ANECDOTE
FROM PROCOPIUS.&mdash;THEIR REDUCTION UNDER
THE CARLOVINGIAN DYNASTY.&mdash;THE ANGLES OF THURINGIA.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the previous chapter has shewn that a
Saxon population, considered simply as such, and
without reference to the particular fact of its date,
locality, and similar important circumstances, may
be in any or no ethnological relation to the Angle
(<i>i.e.</i>, absolutely Angle under a Keltic name, or,
on the other hand, as little Angle as the Slavonians),
the attempt at the reconstruction of
the history of all the Germanic conquerors of
Britain during the period of their occupation of
Germany, although, perhaps, not impracticable
as the subject of a special investigation, and as
the matter of an elaborate monograph, must, in a
sketch like the present, be limited to that of the
unequivocal and undoubted Angles&mdash;this meaning
those who are not only <i>Angle</i> in reality,
but whose actions are described under the name
of <i>Angle</i>. It is only when this is the case that we
can be sure of our men. A Saxon, as aforesaid,
may be anything, provided he be but a pirate.
The greater part, too, of the actions of the <i>Saxons</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
can be shewn to have been effected by the <i>Old</i>-Saxons
rather than the <i>Anglo</i>-Saxons, and even
by Franks and Frisians. Indeed, it is not too much
to assert that, with the exception of the invasion
of Britain and Sleswick, there is no recorded act
of any Saxon population which cannot be more
fairly attributed to some of the other allied sections
of the Germanic stock than to the Angle.
That this was the case with the Saxons of the
Gallic frontier&mdash;the Saxons that, in the earlier
periods of their history, came into collision with
Julian, and, in the later ones, with Charlemagne,
is undoubted; and, that it was also the case with
the earlier Saxon pirates of the coasts of Gaul
and Britain is likely&mdash;though I do not press this
point. What I am considering now is the <i>unequivocal</i>
history of the Angles of Germany under
their own proper name. I have said that it is
fragmentary. It is more than this. The fragments
themselves are heterogeneous.</p>

<p>An Englishman, representing as he does the
<i>insular</i> Angles, and looking to the part that <i>they</i>
have played in the world, may, with either pride
or regret, as the case may be, say that on their
native soil of Germany, the Angle history is next
to a non-entity. It is like that of the Majiars
of Asia. What our ancestors did at home before
they became the Englishmen of Great Britain
may have been of any amount of importance, or,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of any amount of insignificance. They were deeds
without a record. As to our own collateral relations,
they suffered rather than acted. They
have, indeed, a history, but it is a history neither
full nor glorious.</p>

<p>The poem of Beowulf, an extract from Beda,
and a similar extract from Procopius constitute
the notices that continue the history&mdash;if so it
can be called&mdash;of the Angles from the time of
Ptolemy to the beginning of the seventh century,
and even these are doubtful in their interpretation.</p>

<p>Beowulf is a poem in the Anglo-Saxon language,
and, in the alliterative metre of the Anglo-Saxon
compositions in general, of unknown date
and authorship, of upwards of six thousand lines;
a poem which, although preserved in England, and
in a form adapted to English hearers subsequent
to the conversion of our island to Christianity,
is essentially pagan and German&mdash;pagan
in respect to its superstitions and machinery, and
German in respect to the scene of action; for in
Germany, and not in England, are all its actions
achieved. This being the case, it cannot but tell
us <i>something</i> of the ancient Germans; and, as the
hero is an <i>Angle</i>, the ancient Germans of whom
this <i>something</i> is told, are, more or less, the <i>Angle</i>
ancestors of the English in their original continental
home.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Much more than this it is unsafe to say. The
composition itself is a poem&mdash;a romance&mdash;an epic.
This is against the historical value of its subject-matter.
Then, it has taken its present form
under the hands of a Christian. This is against
its value as cotemporaneous evidence. Thirdly,
it has the character, to no small extent, not only
of a rhapsody, but of a rhapsody of which the
elements are heterogeneous. This is against its
value as a piece of <i>Anglicism</i>.</p>

<p>Nick and Grendel&mdash;the old Nick of the present
English, and Grendel&mdash;probably, the Geruthus
of Saxo Grammaticus&mdash;are the chief supernaturals,
demons of the swamp and fen. These
best localize the legends in which they appear;
for which most parts of Hanover and the Cimbric
Chersonesus suit indifferently, the Frisian portions
pre-eminently, well. The more exalted mythology
of Woden, Thor, and Balder, so generally
considered to have been all-pervading in Germany
and Scandinavia, finds no place in Beowulf. Our
Devil and the Devil's Dam are rough analogues
of Nick and Grendel.</p>

<p>Heort is the great palatial hall of Hro&eth;gar,
the kingly personage of the poem, Beowulf being
the hero. It stands in some part of the Cimbric
Chersonese. Seeing in this, as a <i>word</i>, only
another form of the name Hartz, I also see in it
a proof of the rhapsodical character of the poem,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and the heterogeneous character of its elements.</p>

<p>An episode, of which Sigmund is the hero,
gives us a narrative in which we have, in an
altered form, and an obscure outline, a portion
of the Nibelungenlied cycle&mdash;an element from
the Rhine.</p>

<p>Another gives us an adventure apparently
without a hero, or rather an adventure whose
hero has no proper name, but only a designating
adjective. Considering the indistinct shape which
all legends take in Beowulf, I cannot but think
that the individual whose name stands in the
text as <i>Stearc heart</i>, and in the translation as
<i>Strong-heart</i>, is neither more nor less than the
great Danish hero <i>Starcather</i>, of a not unlike
legend in Saxo.</p>

<p>Danes, Geats, Frisians, and Sweas (Swedes),
are the populations with whom the Angles are
most brought in contact; and the following extract
shews the manner of their mention. The
parties, here, are Jutish Danes and Frisians.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. "Hro&eth;gar's poet after the mead-bench must excite joy in the
hall, concerning Finn's descendants, when the expedition came
upon them; Healfdene's hero, Hn&aelig;f the Scylding, was doomed
to fall in Friesland. Hildeburh had at least no cause to praise
the fidelity of the Jutes; guiltlessly was she deprived at the
war-game of her beloved sons and brothers; one after another
they fell wounded with javelins; that was a mournful lady.
Not in vain did Hoce's daughter mourn their death, after morning<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
came, when she under the heaven might behold the slaughterer
of her son, where he before possessed the most of earthly
joys: war took away all Finn's thanes, except only a few, so
that he might not on the place of meeting gain any thing by
fighting against Hengest, nor defend in war his wretched remnant
against the king's thane; but they offered him conditions,
that they would give up to him entirely a second palace, a hall,
and throne, so that they should halve the power with the sons
of the Jutes, and at the gifts of treasure every day Folcwalda's
son should honour the Danes, the troops of Hengest should
serve them with rings, with hoarded treasures of solid gold,
even as much as he would furnish the race of Frisians in the
beer-hall. There they confirmed on both sides a fast treaty of
peace. Finn strongly, undisputingly, engaged by oath to Hengest,
that he would graciously maintain the poor survivors according
to the judgment of his Witan, that there no man, either
by word or work, should break the peace, nor through hostile
machinations ever recall the quarrel, although they, deprived of
their prince, must follow the slaughterer of him that gave them
rings, since they were so compelled: if, then, any one of the
Frisians with insolent speech should make allusion to the deadly
feud, that then the edge of the sword should avenge it. The
oath was completed, and heaped up gold was borne from the
hoard of the warlike Scyldings: the best of warriors was ready
upon the pile; at the pile was easy to be seen the mail-shirt
coloured with gore, the hog of gold, the boar hard as iron, many
a noble crippled with wounds: some fell upon the dead. Then
at Hn&aelig;f's pile Hildeburh commanded her own son to be involved
in flames, to burn his body, and to place him on the pile,
wretchedly upon his shoulder the lady mourned; she lamented
with songs; the warrior mounted the pile; the greatest of death-fires
whirled; the welkin sounded before the mound; the mail-hoods
melted; the gates of the wounds burst open; the loathly
bite of the body, when the blood sprang forth; the flame,
greediest of spirits, devoured all those whom there death took
away: of both the people was the glory departed.</p>

<p>"Thence the warriors set out to visit their dwellings, deprived<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of friends, to see Friesland, their homes and lofty city; Hengest
yet, during the deadly-coloured winter, dwelt with Finn, boldly,
without casting of lots he cultivated the land, although he might
drive upon the sea the ship with the ringed prow; the deep
boiled with storms, wan against the wind, winter locked the
wave with a chain of ice, until the second year came to the
dwellings; so doth yet, that which eternally, happily provideth
weather gloriously bright. When the winter was departed, and
the bosom of the earth was fair, the wanderer set out to explore,
the stranger from his dwellings. He thought the more of vengeance
than of his departing over the sea, if he might bring to
pass a hostile meeting, since he inwardly remembered the sons
of the Jutes. Thus he avoided not death when Hunl&aacute;f's descendant
plunged into his bosom the flame of war, the best of
swords; therefore were among the Jutes, known by the edge of
the sword, what warriors bold of spirit Finn afterwards fell in
with, savage sword-slaughter at his own dwelling; since Gu&eth;l&aacute;f
and Osl&aacute;f after the sea-journey mourned the sorrow, the grim
onset: they avenged a part of their loss; nor might the cunning
of mood refrain in his bosom, when his hall was surrounded
with the men of his foes. Finn also was slain. The king amidst
his band, and the queen was taken; the warriors of the Scyldings
bore to their ships all the household wealth of the mighty
king which they could find in Finn's dwelling, the jewels and
carved gems; they over the sea carried the lordly lady to the
Danes&mdash;led her to their people. The lay was sung, the song of
the glee-man, the joke rose again, the noise from the benches
grew loud, cupbearers gave the wine from wondrous vessels."</p></div>

<p>Hengist appears here as a Jute. Another English
name, that of Offa, occurs in the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>2. "H&aelig;redh's daughter; she was nevertheless not condescending,
nor too liberal of gifts, of hoarded treasures, to the people of
the Ge&aacute;ts; the violent queen of the people exercised violence of
mood, a terrible crime; no one of the dear comrades dared to
venture upon that beast, save her wedded lord, who daily looked<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
upon her with his eyes, but she allotted to him appointed bonds
of slaughter,&mdash;twisted with hands: soon after, after the clutch of
hands, was the matter settled with the knife, so that the excellent
sword must apportion the affair, must make known the fatal
evil: such is no womanly custom for a lady to accomplish, comely
though she be, that the weaver of peace should pursue for his
life, should follow with anger a dear man: that indeed disgusted
Hemming's kinsman. Others said, while drinking the ale, that
she had committed less mighty mischief, less crafty malice, since
she was first given, surrounded with gold, to the young warrior,
the noble beast: since by her father's counsel she sought, in a
journey over the fallow flood, the palace of Offa, where she afterwards
well on her throne in good repute living, enjoyed the living
creations, and held high love with the prince of men, the best
between two seas of all mankind, of the whole race of men, so
far as I have heard: for Offa the spear-bold warrior was far renowned
both for his liberalities and his wars, in wisdom he held
his native inheritance, when he the sad warrior sprang for the
assistance of men, he the kinsman of Hemming, the nephew of
Garmund, mighty in warfare."</p></div>

<p>Beowulf approaches his end; the ceremonies of
his funeral are described in detail, the political
complications created by his death are alluded
to:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>3. "Now is the joy-giver of the people of the Westerns, the Lord
of the Ge&aacute;ts, fast on the death-bed, he dwelleth in fatal rest: by
him lieth his deadly foe, sick with seax-wounds; with his sword
he could not by any means work a wound upon the wretch.
Wigl&aacute;f, Wihst&aacute;n's son, sitteth over Be&oacute;wulf, one warrior over the
other deprived of life holdeth sorrowfully ward of good and
evil: now may the people expect a time of war, as soon as the
fall of the king becomes published among the Franks and Frisians:
the feud was established, fierce against the Hugas, after
Hygel&aacute;c came sailing with a fleet to Friesland, where his foes
humbled him from his war, boldly they went with a superior<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
force, so that the warrior must bow, he fell in battle, nor did the
chieftain give treasure to his valiant comrades: ever since
peace with the sea-wicings denied us: nor do I expect peace or
fidelity from Sweeden, but it was widely known that Ongenthe&oacute;w
deprived of life H&aelig;theyn the Hrethling, beside Hrefna-wood
when for their pride the war-Scylfings first sought the people of
the Ge&aacute;ts. Soon did the prudent father of Ohthere, old and terrible,
give him a blow with the hand; he deprived the sea-king
of the troop of maidens, the old man took the old virgin, hung
round with gold, the mother of Onela and Ohthere, and then
pursued the homicides until they escaped with difficulty into
Hrefnes-holt, deprived of their Lord: then with a mighty force
did he beset those that the sword had left, weary with their
wounds: shame did he often threaten to the wretched race, the
whole night long: he said that he in the morning would take
them with the edges of the sword, some he would hang on the
gallowses, for his sport: comfort came again to the sad of mood,
with early day, since they perceived the horn and trumpets of
Hygel&aacute;c, when the good prince came upon their track with the
power of his people.</p>

<p>"For him then did the people of the Ge&aacute;ts prepare upon the
earth a funeral pile, strong, hung round with helmets, with war-boards
and bright Byrnies, as he had requested: weeping the
heroes then laid down, in the midst their dear lord; then began
the warriors to awake upon the hill the mightiest of bale fires;
the wood-smoke rose aloft, dark from the foe of wood; noisily
it went, mingled with weeping: the mixture of the wind lay on
till it had broken the bonehouse, hot in his breast: sad in mind,
sorry of mood they moaned the death of their lord:&mdash;The people
of the Westerns wrought then a mound over the sea, it was high
and broad, easy to behold by the sailors over the waves, and during
ten days they built up the beacon of the war-renowned, the
mightiest of fires; they surrounded it with a wall, in the most
honourable manner that wise men could devise it: they put into
the mound rings and bright gems,&mdash;all such ornaments as the
fierce-minded men had before taken from the hoard; they suffered
the earth to hold the treasure of warriors, gold on the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the sand, there it yet remaineth as useless to men as it was of old.
Then round the mound rode a troop of beasts of war, of nobles,
twelve in all: they would speak about the king, they would call
him to mind, they would relate the song of words, they would
themselves speak: they praised his valour, and his deeds of bravery
they judged with praise, even as it is fitting that a man
should extol his friendly Lord, should love him in his soul, when
he must depart from the body to become valueless. Thus the
people of the Ge&aacute;ts, his domestic comrades, mourned their dear
Lord; they said that he was of the kings of the world, the mildest
and gentlest of men, the most gracious to his people, and the
most jealous of glory."</p></div>

<p>That Norse, Frisian, Angle, and other Germanic
elements are combined in this poem is certain;
and, looking to the extent to which Beowulf, the
hero, besides other points of indistinctness in respect
to his personality, is Geat as well as Angle,
I cannot but suspect an incorporation of some Slavonic
and Lithuanic ones as well. <i>Finn</i>, too, as
a hero, not of the Laps and Finlanders (to whom
he would be the proper eponymus), but of the
Frisians, creates a further complication.</p>

<p>Hro&eth;gar, too, the Dane or Jute, has a name
inconveniently unlike that of the more historical
Radiger who will soon come under notice.</p>

<p>The chief fact we get from Beowulf is, as is generally
the case with early poems, one in the history
of Fiction; and, to guard against disparaging
such facts as these, let us remember that the history
of Fiction is the history of the Commerce of
Ideas.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Beowulf tells us that, at the time of its
composition, at latest, and, probably, much earlier,
there was a certain interchange of legend
or history between the Danes, Swedes, Lombards,
Franks, Angles, Frisians, and Geats. We
may say, then, that the Angli had an Heroic
Age.</p>

<p>In respect to their historic epoch, a well-known
notice in Beda, freely adopted by most of his
after-comers, deduces the Angles from that part
of Germany which he calls <i>Angulus</i>, between the
provinces of the Jutes and Saxons, and which up
to his own time remained a waste&mdash;"patria qu&aelig;
<i>Angulus</i> dicitur, et ab eo tempore usque hodie
desertus inter provincias Jutarum et Saxonum
perhibetur."</p>

<p>The Saxon Chronicle simply translates this.
Alfred strengthens it, writing that there "the
English dwelt before they came hither."&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to
England.</p>

<p>Ethelweard speaks of "Anglia vetus, sita inter
Saxones et Giotos, habens oppidum capitale, quod
sermone Saxonico <i>Sleswic</i> nuncupatur, secundum
vero Danos, <i>Hathaby</i>."</p>

<p>A well-known locality in the Duchy of Sleswick
supplies the commentary on these texts. A
triangular block of land, about the size of the
county of Middlesex, is bounded on two of its
sides by the Slie and the Firth of Flensburg, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
on the third by the road from that town to Sleswick.</p>

<p>Many writers think that the Angles should be
placed here; and, thinking this, maintain that no
population except that of the Angles or some
closely allied tribe has a claim to be considered
as the early occupants of Holstein and Sleswick.
They overlook, however, the important fact that
Ptolemy, who places the <i>Angili</i> in a locality far
south of the parts in question, places, in those
parts, populations which he separates from his
<i>Angili</i>. They also overlook the still more important
fact that the only populations earlier than
the present of which definite traces can be discovered
in either Holstein or Sleswick, are the Frisians
and the Slavonians&mdash;the Frisians on the
west, and the Slavonians on the east.</p>

<p>In another point of view this district is important,
although the line of criticism upon which it
has its bearing is gradually becoming obsolete.
When the direct influence of the Danes and Norwegians
upon the language of Britain was less
recognized than it is now, it was by no means
uncommon to explain such Scandinavian words
as occurred by the assumption that they were
<i>Angle</i> as opposed to <i>Saxon</i>, the Angle being the
most Danish of all the proper German dialects&mdash;transitional,
perhaps, to the Teutonic and Scandinavian
divisions of the so-called Gothic stock.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
This was a line of criticism difficult to refute;
since the advocate of the Angle origin of Danish
words might fairly argue that it was not enough
to shew that a word was Scandinavian. It must
also be shewn to have been non-existent in the
North-German dialects. This brought in the proverbial
difficulty of proving a negative assertion.
Hence, the district of Anglen and Beda's statement
concerning it are important.</p>

<p>Now, at the present moment, this district of
Anglen is just as <i>Angle</i> or <i>English</i> as the rest of
Germany&mdash;that is, next to not at all. It is Low
German, tinctured with Danish; having once
been more Danish still, as is shewn by the
geographical names ending in -<i>by</i>, -<i>skov</i>,
and -<i>gaard</i>.</p>

<p>The only piece of truly cotemporary evidence
in Beda is the statement of its being a <i>waste</i> when
he wrote, and this is better explained by supposing
it to have been a March, or Debateable Land, between
the Germanic and Danish occupants of Sleswick,
than by the notion that it was left empty
by the exodus of its occupants to Great Britain.
The deduction of the Angli from an improbably
small area, on the wrong side of the Peninsula,
must be looked upon as an inference under the
garb of a tradition. Such I believe it to have
been; freely, however, admitted that if Anglen
poured forth upon England even half the Angles<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
that England contained, it was likely enough to
have been most effectually emptied.</p>

<p>At one time I went further than the mere denial
of <i>Anglen</i> being the original home of the
<i>Angles</i> in the exclusive manner that Beda so evidently
considers it, and looked upon the word as
a mere translation of the word <i>Angulus</i>&mdash;since
the area in question is certainly one of the nooks
and corners of the Peninsula. But the fact of
there being one or two small outlying districts,
retaining (I believe) certain privileges, beyond
the area bounded by the Slie, the Firth of Flensburg
and the road to Sleswick, in the parts about
Leck and Bredsted, and on the North-Frisian
frontier, has modified this view, and inclined me
to the notion that the <i>Anglen</i> districts of Sleswick
were really <i>Angle</i>&mdash;though Angle only in the
way that Britain was Angle, <i>i.e.</i>, from the effect
of an invasion from Hanover. If so, although we
fail in finding in Sleswick the mother-country of
the English, we get a detail in the history of the
Angles of Germany instead&mdash;this being that certain
Angles, probably at the time they were
reducing Britain, may have turned their faces
northwards, and effected settlements in certain
parts of Sleswick, having, previously, reached
the Trave. Hence they achieved a small maritime
conquest on the coast of the Baltic, just as
they effected certain large ones on the shores of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Britain. Why do I suppose this to have been by
sea? Because, when true history begins, whatever
the men of <i>Anglen</i> in Sleswick may have
been, the intermediate parts of Holstein are
Wagrian. The settlement, then, in Anglen, is
just a detail in the naval history of the Angles,
during the period of their rise and progress&mdash;that
is, if it be anything Angle at all.</p>

<p>A notice of Procopius now finds place. An
Angle princess betrothed to Radiger, prince of
the Varni, is deserted by her promised husband
for Theodechild, his father's widow, and avenges
herself by sailing for the mouth of the Rhine
with a large fleet, conquering her undervaluer,
forgiving him as women are likely, and dismissing
her rival, as they are sure to do in such cases.
To deny "all historical foundation to this tale,"
writes Mr. Kemble,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> "would perhaps be carrying
scepticism to an unreasonable extent. Yet the most
superficial examination proves that in all its details,
at least, it is devoid of accuracy. The period
during which the events described must be placed,
is between the years 534 and 547; and it is very
certain that the Varni were not settled at that
time where Procopius has placed them; on that
locality we can only look for Saxons. It is hardly
necessary to say that a fleet of four hundred ships
and an army of one hundred thousand Angles,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
led by a woman, are not data upon which we
could implicitly rely in calculating either the
political or military power of any English principality
at the commencement of the sixth century,
or that ships capable of carrying two hundred-and-fifty
men each, had hardly been launched
at that time from any port in England. Still I
am not altogether disposed to deny the possibility
of predatory expeditions from the settled parts
of the island adjoining the eastern coasts."</p>

<p>From this criticism I only differ in thinking
that, instead of Procopius having mistaken Saxons
for Varni, he has mistaken the Elbe for the
Rhine.</p>

<p>It is a point of some uncertainty, but of no
great importance to ascertain whether the Angle
subjects of the insulted but forgiveful princess
were from Britain or from Hanover&mdash;islanders
already in a state of reaction against their continental
fatherland, or simply Angles of the Elbe.
The accounts of Procopius respecting both countries
are eminently obscure and contradictory.
It is only certain that as early as the ninth
century there were continental writers who attributed
to the Germans of Britain movements
from the Island to the Continent as far back from
their own time as the fifth century. Nay, later
still, there were some historians who wholly
reversed the order of Anglo-Saxon migration,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and deduced the true Fatherland Germans from
England.</p>

<p>And now the history of the rise and progress
of the Angles on the soil of Germany ends. Even
if it can be increased there is but <i>modicum</i> of information.
Yet we could scarcely expect more.
On the contrary, why should not the Angles
have shared the total obscurity of the Nuithones,
Sigulones, and others? What population amongst
those with which they came in contact could
have recorded their alliances, their victories, or
their defeats? Not the Frisians, who were unlettered
as long as they were Pagan, and Pagan
until the tenth century. Not the Slavonians,
whose spiritual and intellectual darkness was
equal. Not the Romans, for reasons already
given. There only remained the Gauls and Britons.
But, unfortunately, in the eyes of the
Gauls and Britons, although all Angles were
Saxons, all Saxons were not Angles&mdash;so that the
proportion of proper Angle history which we have
in the Gallic and British accounts of the Saxons
cannot be determined.</p>

<p>The history of the Saxons of the continent has
been stated to have been the history of the <i>Old</i>-Saxons.
And up to the time of Beda, and about
half a century later, such was the case. Hence,
the rule is as follows&mdash;where we hear of Saxon
actions by sea, the actors may be Old-Saxons,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Angles, Frisians, Scandinavians, or Slavonians,
and where we hear of actions on the <i>Terra Firma</i>
of Germany, and also in the times anterior to <span class="smcapl">B.C.</span>
800, the actors are Old-Saxons rather than Anglo-Saxons.
In this case, except in Britain, we have
little or no Angle history under the name of
Saxon; and, as there is equally little under the
name of Angle, we have, as has been already seen,
next to no Angle history at all&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, <i>in Germany</i>.</p>

<p>But with the reign of Charlemagne the criticism
changes. The <i>Saxon</i> history, even in Germany,
becomes <i>Anglo</i>-Saxon, as well as <i>Old</i>-Saxon,
and it may be that the events are pretty
equally distributed between the two divisions.
The reason is clear. The arms of Southern and
Middle Europe have penetrated to the parts beyond
the Weser, and it only requires the <i>Angles</i>
to be described under their own proper name (instead
of that of Saxon) for us to have the materials
of an average history. It is a sickening and
revolting history, and a history that few nations
but the English can afford. Throughout the
whole length and breadth of Germany there is
not one village, hamlet, or family which can shew
definite signs of descent from the continental ancestors
of the Angles of England. There is not a
man, woman, or child who can say, <i>I have pure
Angle blood in my veins</i>. In no nook or corner
can dialect or sub-dialect of the most provincial<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
form of the German speech be found which shall
have a similar pedigree with the English. The
Angles of the Continent are either exterminated
or undistinguishably mixed up with the other
Germans in proportions more or less large, and
in combinations more or less heterogeneous. And
the history of the Conquest and Conversion of the
Saxons by Charlemagne is the history of this extinction.
It is this that makes it so impossible
to argue backwards from the present state of the
Angles of Germany to an earlier one, and so to
reconstruct their history. They have <i>no</i> present
state. Neither have the <i>Old</i>-Saxons&mdash;their next
of kin. Of the Frisians only, the next nearest,
there are still fragments; for, although the enemy
of the Old-Saxons and the Anglo-Saxons was the
enemy of the Frisians also, he was not equally
their exterminator. They may or may not have
been braver than the Angles and Old-Saxons.
They certainly occupied a more impracticable
country. To this period&mdash;the period of their reduction&mdash;the
Angli and Werini of Thuringia are
attributed. They may, indeed, have got there as
they did to Sleswick, by conquest, and at an earlier
period. If so, there was an alliance. They
were, however, more probably transplanted.</p>

PICTS.&mdash;THE DATE OF THE GERMANIC INVASIONS.&mdash;THE NAMES
ANGLE AND SAXON.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the British Isles at the time of the Angle
invasion we have effected a sketch, rather than
a picture; a sketch indistinct in outline, and with
several of its details almost invisible. Nevertheless,
it is a sketch in which some of the points
are pretty clear. Germans of one or more varieties,
Kelts either Gaelic or British, Picts who may
be anything, Romans and Roman Legionaries are
the chief elements. These we have had to distribute
in Time and Space as we best could. We
have also had, as we best could, to investigate
their relations to each other.</p>

<p>Let us look back upon what has been attempted
in this respect.</p>

<p>And first in respect to our <i>data</i>. The statements
of the early authors, and the value which
is due to them, have formed the subject of a separate
chapter;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and it is hoped, that, without
any undue disparagement, they have been shewn<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to be valid only when they are opposed to a very
small amount of either conflicting facts or <i>a
priori</i> improbabilities. I also lay but little
stress upon them when they assert a negative,
and equally little when their apparent testimony
may be reduced to an inference. Their absolute
testimony, however, must be taken as we
find it.</p>

<p>Partly for the sake of recapitulation, and partly
with the view to give a further investigation
to certain questions which could not well be considered
until certain preliminary facts had been
laid before the reader, the more important inferences
are put in form of the following propositions,
to some of which a commentary is
attached.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p><i>The British Isles were peopled from the Keltic
portion of the continent originally and exclusively.</i></p>

<p>This implies an objection to the doctrine of
any <i>pre</i>-Keltic population, and to the inferences
deduced from certain real or supposed peculiarities
in the shape of the skulls from the tumuli
of the Stone period. (<i>See</i> pp. <a href="#Page_26">26-27</a>.)</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p><i>The Gaels cannot be derived from the Britons,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
nor the Britons from the Gaels; on the contrary,
each branch must have been developed from some
common stock.</i></p>

<p>This rests upon the differences between the
British and Gaelic languages. (<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_83">Chapter V</a>.)</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p><i>Of this common stock the British branch, at
least, must have been developed on the continent.</i>
(<i>See</i> <a href="#Page_90">Chapter VI</a>.)</p>

<p>This, of course, assumes that the Galli of Gaul
were not derived from Britain; a view which
has never been adopted, and which probably has
so little to recommend it as to make its investigation
superfluous.</p>

<p>The British language of Britain and the Gaelic
of Gaul would not have been so much alike as
they were had they developed themselves separately,
each after their own fashion.</p>

<p>This last proposition depends, however, to a
great extent, upon the following, viz., that&mdash;</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p><i>The similarity between the ancient language
of Gaul and the ancient language of Britain is
measured by that between the present Welsh and
the Armorican of Brittany.</i></p>

<p>The arguments of pp. <a href="#Page_86">86-87</a>, resting as they
do upon the close relationship between the ancient<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
language of Gaul<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and the British&mdash;would
be materially impaired by any thing which subtracted
from the evidence in favour of that relationship.</p>

<p>Now the present Welsh and the present Armorican
of Brittany are languages that are very
nearly mutually intelligible.</p>

<p>And as the Armorican represents the ancient
Gallic, and the Welsh the ancient British, the affinity
between the two old tongues must have
been, at least, equal to that between the two new
ones.</p>

<p>But what if the Armorican do not represent
the ancient Gallic, but be merely so much Welsh
or Cornish transferred to Brittany in the fifth
century? In such a case the argument is materially
weakened.</p>

<p>Now there is a certain amount of statements
to this very effect, viz., to the Welsh origin of the
Armorican. Let them be examined.</p>

<p>Gildas, who mentions the rebellion of Maximus,
says nothing of any British migration to Brittany.</p>

<p>Nennius gives us an account beset with inaccuracies,
being to the effect that Maximus the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
seventh <i>imperator</i> in Britain, left the island with
all the British soldiers it contained, killed Gratian
King of Rome, and held rule over all Europe;
that he would not dismiss the soldiers who went
with him, but gave them lands in Armorica or
the country <i>over-sea</i> (<i>Ar-mor</i>-); that, then and
there, these soldiers of Maximus slaughtered all
the males, married the females, and cut out their
tongues lest the children should learn the language
of their parents instead of that of their
conquerors. For this reason we call them <i>Letewicion</i>,
or, <i>half-silent</i> (<i>semi-tacentes</i>). Thus was
Brittany peopled, and Britain emptied; so that
strangers took possession of it.</p>

<p>Beda's account is equally unsatisfactory. The
Britons were the first who came into the island,
and they came <i>from</i> Armorica. It was <i>from</i> Armorica
that they came, it was in the south of
England that they landed, and it was they who
gave the name to the island.</p>

<p>Now there is an error somewhere&mdash;if not in
Beda, in Nennius; if not in Nennius, in Beda.</p>

<p>Traditions are uniform, inferences vary; and
when Nennius brings his Armoricans from Cornwall,
and Beda his Cornishmen from Armorica,
we have a presumption against a <i>tradition</i> being
the basis of their statements. The real basis was
the existence of the British language on both
sides of the Channel, a fact which being differently<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
interpreted by the different writers gave us
two separate and contradictory inferences&mdash;each
legitimate, and each (for want of further <i>data</i>)
wrong.</p>

<p>The present similarity, then, between the Welsh
and Armorican remains unaffected by the statements
of Beda and Nennius; and the commonsense
inference as to the latter language representing
the ancient Gallic takes its course.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p><i>The Belg&aelig; were Kelts of the British branch.</i></p>

<p>This implies an objection to all the arguments
in favour of a Germanic population occupant of
Britain anterior to the Christian era, which are
based on the name <i>Belg&aelig;</i>. (<i>See</i> pp. <a href="#Page_61">61-75</a>.)</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p><i>The Gaelic branch of the Keltic stock may have
been developed in either the British Isles or on
the continent.</i>&mdash;(<a href="#Page_83">Chapter V</a>.)</p>

<p>The following list of words in Professor Newman's
<i>Regal Rome</i>, shewing that a remarkable
class of words in Latin were Keltic rather than
native and Gaelic rather than Welsh, and which
was unpublished when the fifth chapter was
written, favours the doctrine of the Gaels having
been continental as well as insular to an extent
for which I was previously unprepared:&mdash;</p>

<p>It also favours Lhuyd's hypothesis rather than
the Hibernian. (<i>See</i> pp. <a href="#Page_88">88-89</a>.)</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p><i>The earliest ethnology of Scotland was that the
earliest Britons,</i> i.e., <i>either British as opposed to
Gaelic, or Gaelic which, subsequently, became as
British as South Britain itself.</i></p>

<p>This means that the present Gaels were not
aboriginal to the Scotch Highlands, except in
the sense that they were aboriginal to Kent or
Wales. (<i>See</i> pp. <a href="#Page_88">88-89</a>.)</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p><i>The present Scotch Gaels are of Irish origin.</i></p>

<p>These two propositions go together; involving
an objection to the so-called "Caledonian hypothesis"
(p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a>), with which they are incompatible.
Nevertheless, anything confirmatory of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
that hypothesis would, <i>pro tanto</i>, invalidate the
present.</p>

<p>The chief facts upon which this doctrine rest
are&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The absence of the term <i>sliabh</i>, the current
Gaelic form for <i>mountain</i>, throughout Scotland&mdash;even
in the Gaelic parts of it.</p>

<p>2nd. The great extent to which the forms in
<i>aber</i> are found northwards (see p. <a href="#Page_81">81</a>). These
occur so far beyond the Pict area, that, although
so good a writer as Mr. Kemble has
allowed himself to make it commensurate with
the British, and although his list of compounds
of <i>aber</i> has been placed in the present writer's
chapter on the Picts, as an illustration of a certain
line of criticism, the inference that they were
Britons in North-Briton <i>other than Pict</i> is highly
probable. Hence in the northern parts, at least,
the word <i>aber</i> was used not because the country
was Pict, but because it was British.</p>

<p>It is well known that the doctrine is, in respect
to its results, the current one; from which it differs
in resting on ethnological inference, rather
than on a piece of history.</p>

<p>The historical account is to the effect, that the
<i>Scots</i> of Scotland were originally Irish, so that
<i>Ire</i>land was the true and proper <i>Scot</i>land. It
was Ireland where the Scots dwelt when the
Picts came from Scythia, Ireland whence the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Picts took their Scottish wives; and, finally,
Ireland that gave its present Gaelic population
to North Britain. Under a leader named <i>Reuda</i>
the Scots of Ireland sailed across the Irish Sea,
penetrated far into the Firth of Clyde, settled
themselves to the north of the Picts, drove that
nation southwards, multiplied their kind in the
Highlands, and called themselves <i>Dalriads</i> (<i>Dalreudini</i>),
since <i>Reuda</i> was the name of their
chief, and <i>daal</i> meant <i>part</i>. The point where the
Scots landed was just where the British and Pict
areas joined, the parts about Alcluith or Dumbarton&mdash;"procedente
autem tempore, Britannia
post Brittones et Pictos, tertiam Scottorum nationem
in Pictorum parte recepit, qui duce Reuda
de Hibernia progressi vel amicitia vel ferro sibimet
inter eos sedes quas hactenus habent, vindicarunt;
a quo videlicet duce usque hodie <i>dalreudini</i>
vocantur, nam eorum lingua 'daal' <i>partem</i> significat."&mdash;Hist.
Eccl. i. 1.</p>

<p>To agree with Beda in making the Gaels of
Scotland intrusive, but to demur to his evidence,
is, apparently, to substitute a bad reason for a
good one without affecting the conclusion, <i>i.e.</i>,
gratuitously. We shall soon see how far this is
the case.</p>

<p>At present, I remark that all Scotland may
have been British without having been wholly
Pict; and that<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The parts of Scotland which were not Gaelic at
the beginning of the Historical period and have
not been so since, never were.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p><i>The Picts may or may not have been the British
Kelts of Scotland: this depending upon the extent
to which the gloss</i> penn fahel <i>is a word
belonging to the Pict tongue, or only a word belonging
to a language spoken within the Pict
territory.</i></p>

<p>Why should it not be Pict? Why disturb the inference by suggesting
that they may be Pict only as <i>man</i> or <i>woman</i>
are Welsh, <i>i.e.</i>, words other than Pict, but words
used in a Pict area just as English is spoken in
the Welsh town of Swansea? I admit that, if
we look only to the plain and straight-forward
meaning of Beda, this refinement is unnecessary.
There are, however, certain complications.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Daal</i>=<i>part</i>, is suspiciously like the German
<i>theil</i>, the English <i>deal</i>, the Anglo-Saxon <i>d&aelig;l</i>, the
Norse <i>del</i>, <i>dal</i>; indeed, it is a wonder that Beda
took it for a foreign word. Hence, gloss for gloss,
it is <i>nearly</i> as good evidence for the Picts being
German or Norse as <i>penn fahel</i> is for their being
Briton. I say <i>nearly</i>, because it is expressly
stated to have been <i>Scotch</i>. But this it is not.
What, then, is our next best explanation? To
suppose it to have been a word used by a population
other than Scotch, but on the Scotch frontier.
Now this population was Pict.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p><i>The Dalriad Conquest may or may not have
been real. Being real, it may or may not have
given origin to the Gaelic population of Scotland.</i></p>

<p>This means that Beda's evidence, being exceptionable,
may be wholly false&mdash;except so far as it
is an inference from the existence of Gaels in both
Ireland and the Western Highlands.</p>

<p>Even if true as to the fact, its ethnological importance
may be over-valued, since the investigation
of the origin of the Scotch Gaels inquires,
not whether any Irish Scots ever appropriated
any part of Scotland, but whether such an appropriation
were the one which accounts for the
Gaelic population of North Britain. This is the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
difference between <i>a</i> conquest and <i>the</i> conquest&mdash;a
difference too often overlooked.</p>

<p>I should not like to say that the Picts were
not Scandinavians, a point which will be treated
more fully in the thirteenth chapter. Hence&mdash;</p>

<h3>XI.</h3>

<p><i>Scandinavian settlements may have taken
place as early as the earliest notices of the Picts.</i></p>

<p>In this case the lines would be&mdash;Norway, North
Scotland, the Hebrides, Ireland and Galloway.</p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p><i>Germanic elements existed in Britain in the
reign of Diocletian.</i></p>

<p>The notices of the Franks in Kent and Middlesex
suggest this. (<i>See</i> p. <a href="#Page_96">96</a>.)</p>

<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p><i>The Littus Saxonicum must have been ravaged
by Germans as early as the reign of Honorius.</i></p>

<p>This must be admitted even if we construe
<i>Saxonicum</i> as <i>ravaged by Saxons</i>, rather than
<i>occupied by Saxons</i>&mdash;a construction which is so
little natural, that I doubt whether it would ever
have been resorted to if the language of Gildas
had not been supposed to preclude the notion of
any Saxon invasion anterior to <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 449. We
have seen, however, how little that writer was in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the position to make a negative statement, <i>i.e.</i>, to
state, not only that Hengist and Horsa came
over in a given year, but that none of their
countrymen ever did so in a previous one.</p>

<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p><i>No distinction need be drawn between the
Angles and the Saxons of Great Britain on the
strength of the difference of name.</i></p>

<p>This, however, by no means implies that they
are to be identified. It merely means that the
name goes for but little; and that the difference
of origin between the different portions of the
Germanic population of Britain is to be determined
by the facts of each particular case.</p>

continental character than itself, unless reason could be shewn
to the contrary, I ignored the statement of Beda altogether, and
peopled Ireland from the parts about the Mull of Cantyre. The
present change of opinion has arisen out of no change in the
valuation of Beda's statement. The extent to which the forms
in <i>aber</i> are found in Scotland, and the extent to which the name

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<div class="bk1"><p>ANALYSIS OF THE GERMANIC POPULATIONS OF ENGLAND.&mdash;THE
JUTE ELEMENT QUESTIONABLE.&mdash;FRISIAN ELEMENTS PROBABLE.&mdash;OTHER
GERMAN ELEMENTS, HOW FAR PROBABLE.&mdash;FORMS
IN -ING.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present chapter will examine the extent
to which certain Germanic populations mentioned
by Beda and other writers as having taken part
in the Anglo-Saxon invasions of Great Britain
actually did so; it will also inquire whether
certain other populations <i>not</i> so mentioned may
not, nevertheless, have joined in those invasions,
although their share in them has been unrecorded.</p>

<p><i>The Jutes.</i>&mdash;Did Jutes, rather than Angles or
any other allied population, effect the conquest
and occupancy of parts of Hampshire and the
Isle of Wight as they are said to have done?</p>

<p>Let us suppose the case of an American arch&aelig;ologist,
in the absence of any authentic history,
reasoning about the origin of the three populations
of Plymouth, New Jersey, and Portsmouth,
three populations lying within no great distance
of each other. He knows that, as a general rule,
they are to be deduced from England; and he
studies the map of England accordingly. On<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the south-coast he finds a Jersey, which he reasonably
infers is the <i>Old</i> Jersey, the mother-country
of the Americans of the <i>New</i>. He also
finds a Plymouth, from which he draws the same
equally reasonable inference. Lastly, he sees a
town named Portsmouth&mdash;and here he repeats
his reasoning&mdash;reasoning which is eminently logical,
cogent, and apparently conclusive. It passes
without challenge or objection, and the origin
of the three populations gradually loses its inferential
character, and assumes that of a fact
founded upon evidence. A writer who adopts
his views, perhaps the very writer himself, more
or less unconsciously, next believes that his doctrine
has an historical rather than a logical basis,
and it passes for a fact founded upon records, or
at least on tradition. In such a case a sentence
like the following might easily be written&mdash;"they"
(viz., the populations of New Jersey, Plymouth,
and Portsmouth) "came from three of
the more powerful populations of England, <i>i.e.</i>,
those of Jersey, Plymouth, and Portsmouth.
From those of Jersey came the men of New
Jersey, from those of Plymouth the men of Plymouth,
and from those of Portsmouth the men
of the parts so-called." I say that such a sentence
might be written, might pass as a fact, and
whether fact or not, would contain an argument
so legitimate as to stand against nine hundred<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and ninety-nine objections out of a thousand.
Yet the thousandth might set it aside, since certain
facts might have been overlooked.</p>

<p>What if the name of an original Indian tribe
had been Jersey (or some name like it), or Portsmouth,
or Plymouth? The chances, I admit, are
against such an occurrence. But what if it really
happened? It cannot be denied that it would
materially shake the inference. Nay more, however
much that inference took the guise of a
tradition or record, it would shake the statement
of the author who made it, however unexceptionable.</p>

<p>Still the doctrine might be correct, and not
only correct, but capable of having its correctness
demonstrated. Let the name in question be the
one last mentioned&mdash;New Jersey. Let the Old
Jersey people of England be like those of Plymouth,
but different from them in some definite
characteristics. Let those characteristics
re-appear in the New Jersey men of America. In
such a case, the exceptions taken to the statement
from the present existence of an aboriginal Indian
population called <i>Nujersi</i> (for such we
will suppose the name to be) would fall to the
ground.</p>

<p>But what if no ethnological acuteness, no etymological
sagacity, no minute analysis of names,
traditions, or dialect had ever succeeded in detecting<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
such <i>differenti&aelig;</i>, so that, despite of the
endeavours of learned antiquarians, the men of
New Jersey could not be shewn to differ from
those of Plymouth and Portsmouth, whilst all the
while the <i>Old</i> Jersey men did so differ. In such
a case the objection that was originally taken
from the previous name of the Indian tribe would
stand valid.</p>

<p><i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, this applies to Beda's statement
concerning the Jutes&mdash;the statement being
as follows:&mdash;"Advenerant autem de tribus Germani&aelig;
populis fortioribus, id est <i>Saxonibus</i>, <i>Anglis</i>,
<i>Jutis</i>. De <i>Jutarum</i> origine sunt <i>Cantuarii</i>
et <i>Vectuarii</i>, hoc est ea gens, qu&aelig; Vectam tenet
insulam, et ea, qu&aelig; usque hodie in provincia Occidentalium
Saxonum <i>Jutarum</i> natio nominatur,
posita contra ipsam insulam Vectam. De <i>Saxonibus</i>,
id est ea regione, qu&aelig; nunc antiquorum
Saxonum cognominatur, venere <i>Orientales
Saxones</i>, <i>Meridiani Saxones</i>, <i>Occidui Saxones</i>.
Porro de <i>Anglis</i>, hoc est de illa patria, qu&aelig; Angulus
dicitur et ab eo tempore usque hodie manere
desertus inter provincias Jutarum et Saxonum

Angli</i>, <i>Mercii</i>, tota <i>Nordhumbrorum</i> progenies, id
est illarum gentium, qu&aelig; ad boream Humbri fluminis
inhabitant, ceterique Anglorum populi sunt
orti."&mdash;Beda 1, 15.</p>

<p>Angles, Saxons, and Jutes occurred within<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
comparatively narrow limits in Great Britain,
and, within equally narrow limits, Angles, Saxons,
and Jutes occurred in Northern Germany and
Denmark.</p>

<p>The Angles of England undoubtedly came from
Germany; so did the Saxons.</p>

<p>But did the <i>Jutes</i>? Let us look to the different
forms their name took; and also to those of
that of the Jutes of Jutland; and, when we have
seen that occasionally they both took the same,
let us ask whether the objection which has just
been suggested against the supposed American
speculations do not apply to the real English
one.</p>

<p>The Jutes of England were called <i>Jutna-cyn</i>,
or the <i>Jute-kin</i>; their locality was the Isle of
Wight, and from that island they were called
<i>Wiht</i>-ware, <i>Vect</i>-ienses or <i>Vecti</i>-col&aelig;. Beda himself
identifies these two populations, saying that
the <i>Vect-uarii</i> (<i>Wiht-ware</i>), "who held the Isle
of Wight, were of Jute origin." And, lest this
be insufficient, both the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
and Alfred repeat (or rather translate) the assertion:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now this name <i>Wiht</i> never came from the
Jutes at all; since it existed three hundred years
before their supposed advent, as the word <i>Vectis</i>=<i>the
Isle of Wight</i>; and was a British, rather than
a German, term.</p>

<p>And the <i>Wiht-ware</i> were, partially at least, no
Germans but Britons, and as Britons, rather than
as Jutlanders, did they stand in contrast with
the Saxons of the neighbourhood. The proof of
this is in Asser, who says that Alfred's mother
"Osburg nominabatur, religiosa nimium f&aelig;mina,
Nobilis ingenio, nobilis et genere; qu&aelig; erat filia
Oslac&mdash;qui Oslac Gothus erat natione, ortus enim
erat de Gothis et Jutis; de semine scilicit Stuf et
Wihtgar&mdash;qui accept&acirc; potestate Vectis Insul&aelig;&mdash;paucos
Britannos, ejusdem insul&aelig; accolas, quos in

occiderunt, c&aelig;teri enim accol&aelig; ejusdem
insul&aelig; ante sunt occisi aut exules aufugerant."&mdash;Asserius,
<i>De Gestis Alfredi Regis</i>.</p>

<p>So that Gwit-<i>garaburg</i> is now <i>Caris-brook</i>, and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
<i>Caris-brook</i> in the time of Stuf and Wihtgar, was
the last stronghold of the <i>Gwit&aelig;</i>, <i>Vit&aelig;</i>, <i>Vecticol&aelig;</i>
or <i>Vectienses</i>, who were simply Britons confounded
with <i>Jut-&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>Who then were the <i>Jutnacyn</i>, who lived in
Hampshire, as opposed to those of Carisbrook in
the Isle of Wight? I imagine, without pressing
the point, or supposing that anything important
depends on it, that they were the <i>Exules</i> of
Asser, the remnants who escaped from the exterminating
swords of Stuf and Wihtgar, in their
conquest of the island. That they existed in the
time of Beda is true; not however as Danes from
Jutland, but as Britons from the land of the
<i>Wiht-ware</i>.</p>

<p>I do not profess to say why there was the
double form <i>Vit</i>, and <i>Jut</i>&mdash;nor should I have
identified them myself. It is not I who have
done this, but Beda and Alfred; as must be admitted
by any one who cannot shew a difference
between the <i>Wiht-ware</i> and the <i>Jutna-cyn</i>&mdash;both
authors deriving each from the <i>Jutes</i>.</p>

<p>Neither can I say how <i>Jutland</i> came to be
called <i>Vit-land</i>; I can only say that the change
is no <i>assumption</i>. In a document of <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 952 we
find it so called&mdash;Dania Cismarina quam <i>Vitland</i>
appellant.&mdash;<i>See</i> Zeuss in <i>v</i>.</p>

<p>As stated above, all this falls to the ground if
any separate substantive reasons for considering<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the <i>Wiht-ware</i> to be <i>Jutlanders</i> can be shewn.
But such are wanting. If either they or the Jutnacyn
of the opposite coast of Hants were Danes
in the time of Alfred and Beda, where were the
signs of their origin? Not in their language;
since no mention is made of the Danish in Beda's
list of British tongues. Not in the names of geographical
localities. Neither -<i>ware</i>, nor -<i>burgh</i>,
(in <i>Gwith -wara -burg</i>) are Danish terms. Where
are such signs now? The Danish termination for
towns and villages is -<i>by</i>. There is no such ending
in either Hampshire or the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>Did Jutes rather than Angles or any other
allied population effect the conquest and occupancy
of Kent, as they are said to have done?</p>

<p>It is only the Jute origin of the <i>Jutnacyn</i> or
<i>Wihtware</i> of Hants that the preceding reasoning
impugns. The Jute origin of the Cantware, or
people of Kent, is a separate question.</p>

<p>I only suspect error here: the reasons for doing
so being partly of a positive, partly of a negative
nature:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. As far as traditions are worth anything, they
make Hengist a <i>Frisian</i> hero.</p>

<p>2. No name of any Kentish King is Danish.</p>

<p>3. No Danish forms for geographical localities
occur in the county.</p>

<p>That the Kentish population has certain peculiarities
is highly probable; and it is also probable<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
that similar peculiarities on the part of the
population of Hants brought the two within the
same category. And hence came the extension of
the Jute hypothesis to the <i>Cantware</i>.</p>

<p><i>Were there Frisians in England?</i>&mdash;The presumption
is in favour of the affirmative; since the
Frisians were eminently the occupiers of the German
sea-coast.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A native tradition makes Hengist a Frisian.</p>

<p>2. Procopius writes that "three numerous nations
occupy Brittia&mdash;the Angili, the Phrissones,
and the Britons."&mdash;<span class="smcapl">B. G.</span>, iv. 20.</p>

<p>3. In one of Alfred's engagements against the
Danes the vessels are said to have been "shapen
neither like the Frisian nor the Danish," and that
there were killed in the engagement "Wulfheard
the Frisian, and &AElig;bbe the Frisian, and &AElig;thelhere
the Frisian&mdash;and of all the men, Frisians and
English, seventy-two."&mdash;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,
<span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 897.</p>

<p>In Mr. Kemble's "Saxons in England," a fresh
instrument of criticism is exhibited. A local
name like that of the present town of <i>Kettering</i>
is in Anglo-Saxon <i>Cytringas</i>. Here the -<i>as</i> is
the sign of the plural number, and the -<i>ing</i>- a
sort of Anglo-Saxon patronymic, or, (if this expression
be exceptional) a Gentile form. Hence,
<i>Cytr-ing-as</i> means the <i>Cytrings</i>, and is the name<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of a <i>community</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, it is a political or social
rather than a geographical term.</p>

<p>Now nearly two hundred such terms occur in
the Anglo-Saxon Chartas as names of places.</p>

<p>But besides the simple form in -<i>ing</i> (Anglo-Saxon
-<i>ing-as</i>) there is a series of compounds in
-<i>w&iacute;c</i>, -<i>ham</i>, -<i>weor&eth;</i>, -<i>tun</i>, -<i>hurst</i>, &amp;c., as Bill-<i>ing</i>,
Billing-<i>ham</i>, Billing-<i>hay</i>, Billing-<i>borough</i>, Billing-<i>ford</i>,
Billing-<i>ton</i>, Billing-<i>ley</i>, Billings-<i>gate</i>, Billing-<i>hurst</i>,
&amp;c., most of which it is safe to say mean
the -<i>hurst</i>, the -<i>town</i>, &amp;c., of the <i>Billings</i>. Now&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The distribution of these forms, either simple
or compound, over the counties of England is as
follows. There are in&mdash;</p>

<p>York, 127; Norfolk, 97; Lincolnshire, 76; Sussex,
68; Kent, 60; Suffolk, 56; Essex, 48; Northumberland,
48; Gloucester, 46; Somerset, 45;
Northampton, 35; Shropshire, 34; Hants, 33;
Oxford, 31; Warwick, 31; Lancashire, 26; Cheshire,
25; Wilts, 25; Devon, 24; Bedford, 22;
Berks, 22; Nottingham, 22; Cambridge, 21;
Leicester, 19; Durham, 19; Stafford, 19; Surrey,
18; Bucks, 17; Huntingdon, 16; Hereford, 15;
Derby, 14; Worcester, 13; Middlesex, 12; Hertford,
10; Cumberland, 6; Rutland, 4; Westmoreland,
2; Cornwall, 2; Monmouth, 0.</p>

<p>In valuing this list the size of the county
must be borne in mind. Subject to this qualification,
the proportion of the forms in -<i>ing</i>, is a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
measure of the Germanism of the population. It
is at the <i>maximum</i> in Kent and Norfolk, and at
the <i>minimum</i> in Cornwall and Monmouth.</p>

<p>2. The simple forms (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>Billings</i>) as opposed
to the compounds (Billing-<i>hay</i>) bear the following
proportions:&mdash;</p>

<p>Now the simple forms Mr. Kemble considers
to have been the names of the older and more
original settlements with the "further possibility
of the settlements distinguished by the addition
of -<i>h&aacute;m</i>, -<i>wic</i>, and so forth, to the original names,
having being filial settlements, or, as it were,
colonies, from them."&mdash;<i>Saxons in England</i>, i. 479.</p>

<p>3. The same names appear in different localities,
<i>e.g.</i>:</p>

<p>If all these names are to be found not only
in Germany but in the <i>Angle</i> part of it, the current
opinion as to the homogeneous character of
the Anglo-Saxon population stands undisturbed.
Each, however, is found <i>beyond</i> the Angle area,
and so far as this is the case, we have an argument
in favour of our early population having
been slightly heterogeneous.</p>

<div class="snt"><span class="smcapl">A.D.</span><br />787.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle we find the following
notices:&mdash;"This year King Beorhtric took
to wife Eadburg, King Offa's daughter; and
in his days first came three ships of Northmen,
out of H&aelig;retha-land. And then the reeve
rode to the place, and would have driven them to
the king's town, because he knew not who they
were; and they there slew him. These were the
first ships of Danish-men which sought the land
of the English race." Again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="snt"><span class="smcapl">A.D.</span><br />793.</div>

<p>"This year dire forewarnings came over
the land of the North-humbrians, and miserably
terrified the people; these were excessive
whirlwinds, and lightnings; and fiery dragons
were seen flying in the air. A great famine soon
followed these tokens: and a little after that, in
the same year, on the 6th of the Ides of January,
the ravaging of heathen men lamentably
destroyed God's church at Lindisfarn, through<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
rapine and slaughter. And Siega died on the
8th of the Kalends of March."</p>

<p>After this the notices of the formidable Danes
become numerous and important. But it is not
in the pages of history that the influence of their
invasions is to be found. The provincial dialects
of the British Isles, the local names in the
map of Europe, the traditions and (in some
cases) the pedigrees of the older families are the
best sources.</p>

<p>If we study the local names of Germany and
Scandinavia, we shall find that when we get
North of the Eyder a change takes place. In
Sleswick the compound names of places begin to
end in -<i>gaard</i>, -<i>skov</i>, and -<i>by</i>; in -<i>by</i> most especially,
as Oster-<i>by</i>, Wis-<i>by</i>, Gammel-<i>by</i>, Nor-<i>by</i>,
&amp;c. In Jutland the forms in -<i>by</i> attain their
<i>maximum</i>. They prevail in the islands. They
prevail in Sweden. They are rare (a fact of great
importance) in Norway. In Germany they are
either non-existent or accidental. In respect to
its meaning, <i>by</i>=<i>town</i>, <i>village</i>, <i>settlement</i>; and
<i>By-en</i>=<i>the town</i>, is a term by which Christiania
or Copenhagen&mdash;the metropoles of Norway and
Denmark&mdash;are designated. Such forms as Kir-<i>ton</i>,
Nor-<i>ton</i>, and New-<i>ton</i> in German would, in
Danish, be Kir-<i>by</i>, Nor-<i>by</i>, New-<i>by</i>.</p>

<p>Now the distribution of the forms in -<i>by</i> over
the British Isles has the same import as its distribution<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
in Germany and Scandinavia. It indicates
a Danish as opposed to a German occupancy.
Again&mdash;the Anglo-Saxon forms are <i>Church</i> and
<i>Ship</i>, as in Dun-<i>church</i> and <i>Ship</i>-ton; whereas
the Danish are <i>Kirk</i> and <i>Skip</i>, as in Orms-<i>kirk</i>
and <i>Skip</i>-ton. The distribution of these forms
over the British Isles closely coincides with that
of the compounds in -<i>by</i>.</p>

<p>With these preliminaries we will follow the
lines which are marked out by the occurrence of
the places in -<i>by</i>; beginning at a point on the
coast of Lincolnshire, about half-way between the
entrance to the Wash and the mouth of the Humber;
the direction being south and south-west.
Ander-<i>by</i> Creek, Willough-<i>by</i> Hills, Mum-<i>by</i>, Or-<i>by</i>,
Ir-<i>by</i>, Firs-<i>by</i>, Reves-<i>by</i>, Conings-<i>by</i>, Ewer-<i>by</i>,
Asgar-<i>by</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Span-<i>by</i>, Dows-<i>by</i>, Duns-<i>by</i>, Hacon-<i>by</i>,<a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
Thurl-<i>by</i>, Carl-<i>by</i><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> take us into Rutlandshire,
where we find only Grun-<i>by</i> and Hoo-<i>by</i>. Neither
are they numerous in Northamptonshire; Canons'
Ash-<i>by</i>, Cates-<i>by</i>, and Bad-<i>by</i> giving us the outline
of the South-eastern parts of their area. For
Huntingdon, Cambridge, and Beds, nothing ends
in -<i>by</i>, whilst the other forms are in <i>sh</i>, and <i>ch</i>&mdash;as
<i>Charlton</i>, <i>Shelton</i>, <i>Chesterton</i> rather than
<i>Carlton</i>, <i>Skelton</i>, <i>Casterton</i>. Leicestershire is<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
full of the form, as may be seen by looking at
the parts about Melton, along the valleys of
the Wreak and Soar; but as we approach Warwickshire
they decrease, and there is none south
of Rug-<i>by</i>. More than this, the form changes suddenly,
and three miles below the last named town
we have Dun-<i>ch</i>ur<i>ch</i> and Coa<i>ch</i>-bat<i>ch</i>. Tradition,
too, indicates the existence of an old March
or Debateable Land; for south of Rug-<i>by</i> begins
the scene of the deeds of Guy Earl of Warwick,
the slayer of the <i>Dun</i> Cow. Probably, too, the
Bevis of Hampton was a similar<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> North-<i>amp</i>-<i>ton</i>-shire
hero, notwithstanding the claim of the
town of Southampton.</p>

<p>The line now takes a direction northwards and
passes through Bretby (on the Trent) to Derby,
Leicestershire being wholly included. And here
the frontier of the forest which originally covered
the coal-district seems to have been the western
limit to the Danish encroachments, Rotherham,
Sheffield, and Leeds lying beyond, but with the
greater part of Nottinghamshire and a large part
of Derby within, it. In Yorkshire the East
Riding is Danish, and the North to a great extent;
indeed the western feeders of the Ouse
seem to have been followed up to their head-waters,
and the watershed of England to have
been crossed. This gives the numerous -<i>bys</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in Cumberland and Westmoreland<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;Kirk-<i>by</i>,
Apple-<i>by</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>So much for the very irregular and remarkable
outline of the area of the forms in -<i>by</i> on its
southern and western sides. In the north-east it
nearly coincides with the valley of the Tees&mdash;nearly
but not quite; since, in Durham, we have
Ra-<i>by</i>, Sela-<i>by</i>, and Rum-<i>by</i>. The derivatives of
<i>castra</i>, on the other hand, are in -<i>ch</i>-; <i>e.g.</i>, Eb<i>ch</i>ester,
<i>Ch</i>ester-le-street, Lan<i>ch</i>ester (Lan-<i>c</i>aster).
In Northumberland there are none.</p>

<p>I look upon this as the one large main Danish
area of Great Britain, its occupants having been
deduced from a series of primary settlements on
the Humber. It coincides chiefly with the water-system
of the Trent, makes Lincolnshire, and the
East Riding of Yorkshire the mother-countries,
and suggests the notions that, as compared with
the Humber, the rivers of the Wash, and the
river Tees were unimportant. The oldest and
most thoroughly Danish town was Grimsby. The
settlements were generally small. I infer this
from the extent to which the names are compounded
of -<i>by</i> and a noun in the genitive case
<i>singular</i> (Candel-<i>s</i>-<i>by</i>, Grim-<i>s</i>-<i>by</i>, &amp;c.). Danish
names such as Thorold, Thurkill, Orme, &amp;c., are
eminently common in Lincolnshire; and, at Grimsby,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
a vestige of the famous Danish hero Havelok
is still preserved in <i>Havelok-street</i>. On the other
hand, the number of Danish idioms in the provincial
dialects is by no means proportionate to
the preponderance of the forms in -<i>by</i>. In Lincolnshire
it is but small, though larger in Yorkshire
and Cumberland.</p>

<p>The extent to which the rivers which fall in
the Wash are <i>not</i> characterized by the presence of
forms in -<i>by</i> is remarkable. The Witham and
Welland alone (and they but partially) have -<i>bys</i>
on their banks. Again&mdash;</p>

<p>Just above Yarmouth, between the Yare, the
North River and the sea, is a remarkable congregation
of forms in -<i>by</i>. These are more numerous in
this little tract than the rest of Norfolk, Suffolk,
and Essex together&mdash;Mault-<i>by</i>, Orms-<i>by</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> (doubly
Danish), Hemes-<i>by</i>, &amp;c. This may indicate either
a settlement direct from Scandinavia, or a secondary
settlement from Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>However doubtful this may be, it is safe to
attribute the -<i>bys</i> on the West of England, to the
Danes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, the
Danes of the Valley of the Eden. These spread&mdash;</p>

<p>A. Northwards, following either the coast of
Galloway or the water-system of the Annan,
Locker-<i>bie</i>, &amp;c.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>B. Westwards into the Isle of Man&mdash;</p>

<p>C. Southwards into&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Cheshire, Lancashire, and Carnarvonshire
(<i>Orms</i>-head), always, however, within a moderate
distance of the sea&mdash;Horn-<i>by</i>, Orms-<i>kirk</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Whit-<i>by</i>, Ire-<i>by</i>, Hels-<i>by</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Pembrokeshire; where in Haver-<i>ford</i> and Mil-<i>ford</i>
the element <i>ford</i> is equivalent to the Danish
<i>Fiord</i>, and the Scotch <i>Firth</i>, and translates the
Latin word <i>sinus</i>&mdash;not <i>vadum</i>. <i>Guard</i>- in Fish-<i>guard</i>
is Danish also; as are Ten-<i>by</i> and <i>Harold</i>-stone.</p>

<p>Such is the distribution of one branch of the
Scandinavians, viz.: those from Jutland, the
Danish Isles, and (perhaps) the South of Sweden.
That of the Norwegians of Norway is different.
Shetland, the Orkneys, Caithness, and Sutherland,
the Hebrides, and Ireland, form the line of
invasion here. In Man the two branches met&mdash;the
Danish from the east, and the Norwegian from
the north and east.</p>

<p>The numerous details respecting the Scandinavians
in Britain are to be found in Mr. Worsaae's
"Danes and Northmen;" and, besides this, the
proof of the distinction just drawn between the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Danes of South Britain and the Norwegians of
Scotland, the Hebrides and Ireland. It lies in
the phenomena connected with the form -<i>by</i>.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Common as they are in Denmark and Sweden,
they are almost wholly wanting in Norway.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Common as are other Scandinavian elements,
the forms in -<i>by</i> are almost wholly wanting in
Scotland and Ireland.</p>

<p>Hence&mdash;<i>Northman</i> or <i>Scandinavian</i> means a
<i>Dane</i> in South Britain, a <i>Norwegian</i> in Scotland
and Ireland, and a Dane <i>or</i> Norwegian, as the particular
case may be, in the Isle of Man, Northumberland,
and Durham. This is well shewn, and
that for the first time, in the valuable work
referred to.</p>

<p>Can this analysis be carried further? Probably
it can. Over and above the consideration of the
Frisians of Friesland,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> there is that of the North-Frisians.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Some of these may easily have formed
part of the Scandinavian invasion. The nearest
approach to absolute evidence on this point is
to be found in the East Riding of Yorkshire;
where in Holdernesse we have the Frisian forms
News-<i>om</i>, Holl-<i>ym</i>, Arr-<i>am</i>, and the compound
Fris-<i>marsh</i>. The Leicestershire Fris-<i>by</i> is more
evidently <i>North</i>-Frisian.</p>

<p>Again, a writer who, like the present, believes
that, until a comparatively recent period, South<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Jutland, the Danish Isles, and the South of
Sweden, <i>at least</i>, were Sarmatian, is justified in
asking whether members of this stock also may
not have helped to swell the Scandinavian host.
The presumption is in favour of their having
done so; the <i>a posteriori</i> evidence scanty. Two
personages of our popular mythology, however,
seem Slavonic&mdash;Old <i>Bogy</i> and Old <i>Scratch</i>. <i>Bog</i>
in Slavonic is <i>God</i>, or <i>D&aelig;mon</i>; so that Czerne-<i>bog</i>=<i>Black
God</i>, and Biele-<i>bog</i>=<i>White God</i>;
whereas no Gothic interpretation is equally
probable.</p>

<p>Old <i>Scratch</i> is the <i>Hairy one</i>, or <i>Pilosus</i>, as
his name is rendered in the glosses. In Bohemian
we have the forms <i>scret</i>, <i>screti</i>, <i>scretti</i>, <i>skr'et</i>,
<i>s'kr'jtek</i>=<i>demon</i>, <i>household god</i>; in Polish, <i>skrzot</i>
and <i>skrzitek</i>; in Slovenian, <i>shkr&aacute;tie</i>, <i>shkr&aacute;tely</i>.
On the other hand, in the Old High German,
the Icelandic, and some of the Low German
dialects, the word occurs as it does in English.
Still the combination of sounds is so Slavonic,
and the name is spread over so great a portion
of the Slavonic area, that I look upon it
as essentially and originally belonging to that
family.</p>

<p>The ethnological analysis of the Scandinavians
is one question; the date of their first invasion,
another. The statements of the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle opened the present chapter. Is there<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
reason to criticize them? For the fact of Danes
having wintered in England <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 787 they are
unexceptionable. For the fact of their having
never done so before, they only supply the unsatisfactory
assertion of a negative.</p>

<p>For my own part I should not like to deny
the presence of Scandinavians in certain parts of
Great Britain, even at the very beginning of the
Historical period. That this was the case with
Orkney and Shetland few, perhaps, are inclined
to deny. But the gloss <i>dal</i><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>, combined the exception
which can be taken to the words <i>penn
fahel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> gives a probability to the Scandinavian
origin of the <i>Picts</i> which has not hitherto been
generally admitted&mdash;the present writer, amongst
others, having denied it.</p>

<p>When the Britons had occupied the greater
part of the Island they were met by the <i>Picts</i>
from <i>Scythia</i>. It was not, however, on any part
of Great Britain that the Picts first landed.</p>

<p>It was on the north coast of Ireland, then held
by Scots. But the Scots had no room for them,
so they told them of the opposite island of
Britain, and recommended them to take possession
of it; which was done accordingly. "And
as the Picts had no wives, and had to seek them
from the Scots, they were granted on the sole
condition, that whenever the succession became<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
doubtful, the female line should be preferred over
the male; which is kept up even now amongst
the Picts." This peculiarity in the Pict law of
succession is interesting; and as Beda speaks to
it as a cotemporary witness, it must pass as one
of the few definite facts in the Pict history. Another
statement of true importance is, that the
Scriptures were read in all the languages of
Great Britain; there being five in number: the
Latin, the Angle, the British, the Scottish, and
the <i>Pict</i>.</p>

<p>Could this <i>Pictish</i> have been Scandinavian, a
language closely allied to the Anglo-Saxon, without
Beda knowing it? I once answered hastily
in the negative, but the fact that he actually
overlooks the Gothic character of the word <i>dal</i>
(=<i>part</i>), has modified my view.</p>

<p>On the other hand, their deduction from Scythia
goes for nothing. The text which supplied Beda
with his statement has come down to us, though,
unfortunately, with three different readings. It
is from Gildas, and seems to be one of that
author's least happy attempts at fine writing.</p>

<p>He calls the German Ocean the <i>Tithic Valley</i>,
or the Valley of <i>Tithys</i> (<i>Thetis?</i>). In one out of
the two MSS. which deviate from the form <i>Tithecam
Vallem</i>, the reading is <i>Aticam</i>, and in the
other <i>Styticam</i>. I give the texts of Gildas in full.
They may serve to shew his style:&mdash;"Itaque illis<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
ad sua remeantibus, emergunt certatim de curucis,
quibus sunt trans Tithecam vallem vecti,
quasi in alto Titane incalescente caumate de
aridissimis foraminum cavernulis fusci vermiculorum
cenei, tetri Scotorum Pictorumque greges,
moribus ex parte dissidentes, et una eademque
sanguinis fundendi aviditate concordes, furciferosque
magis vultus pilis, quam corporum pudenda
pudendisque proxima vestibus tegentes,
cognitaque condebitorum reversione, et reditus
denegatione, solito confidentius, omnem Aquilonalem
extremamque terr&aelig; partem, pro indigenis
muro tenus capessunt."&mdash;<i>Historia</i>, &sect;. 15.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, Gildas readily wrote Scythica;
for there <i>was</i> a reason, as reasons went in the
sixth century, for his doing so. It was, probably,
the following lines in Virgil:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Aspice et extremis domitum cultoribus orbem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eoasque domos Arabum, <i>pictosque Gelonos</i>."&mdash;G. xi. 115.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>That either Gildas or Beda knew of the line or
translated it as if the <i>Picts</i> were <i>Geloni</i> cannot be
shewn; but that an author not very much later
than Beda did so is shewn by the following extract
from a Life of St. Vodoal, written about the
beginning of the tenth century&mdash;"The Blessed
Vodoal was (as they say) sprung from the arrow-bearing
nation of the <i>Geloni</i>, who are believed to
have drawn their origin from <i>Scythia</i>. Concerning<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
whom, the poet writes <i>Pictosque Gelonos</i>; and
from that time till now they are called <i>Picts</i>."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
<i>Sagittiferi</i> is as Virgilian as the word <i>Picti</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;">
<span class="i0">"Hic Nomadum genus et discinctos Mulciber Afros,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hic Lelegas, Carasque sagittiferosque Gelonos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finxerat."&mdash;Aen. viii. 725.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Another element in the reasoning upon the
date of the earliest Scandinavians is the fact that
more than one enquirer has noticed in the nomenclature
of a writer so early as Ptolemy, words
with an aspect more or less Scandinavian&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
Ar-<i>beia</i>, Leucopi-<i>bi</i>-um, <i>Vand</i>-<i>uarii</i> (Aqui-col&aelig;),
<i>Lox</i>-ius fluvius (=Salmon River), and, perhaps,
some others.</p>

<p>To argue that there were Scandinavians
amongst us in the second century, because certain
words were Norse, and then to infer the
Norse character of the words in question from the
presence of Scandinavians is a vicious circle from
which we must keep apart. At the same time,
the insufficiency of the early historians to give a
negative, the oversight of Beda in respect to the
word <i>dal</i>, and the exceptions which can be taken
to the gloss <i>penn fahel</i>, are all elements of importance.
The present writer believes that there
<i>were</i> Norsemen in Britain anterior to <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 787,
and also that those Norsemen <i>may</i> have been
the Picts.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The Danish and Norwegian subjects of Canute
give us a <i>direct</i>, the Normans of William the
Conqueror an <i>indirect</i>, Scandinavian element.</p>

<p>"The latest conquerors of this island were also
the bravest and the best. I do not except even
the Romans. And, in spite of our sympathies
with Harold and Hereward, and our abhorrence
of the founder of the New Forest and the desolator
of Yorkshire, we must confess the superiority
of the Normans to the Anglo-Saxons and
Anglo-Danes, whom they met here in 1066, as
well as to the degenerate Frank <i>noblesse</i>, and
the crushed and servile Romanesque provincials,
from whom, in 912, they had wrested the district
in the north of Gaul, which still bears the name
of Normandy."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>This leads us to the analysis of the blood of
the <i>Norman</i>, or <i>North-man</i>. Occupant as he is
of a country so far south as Normandy, this is his
designation; since the Scandinavians who in the
eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries ravaged Great
Britain, extended themselves along the coasts of
the Continent as well. And here they are subject
to the same questions as the Scandinavians
of Lincolnshire, Scotland, and the Isle of Man.
They are liable to being claimed as Norwegians,
and liable to be claimed as Danes; they may or<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
they may not have had forerunners; their blood,
if Danish rather than Norwegian, may have been
Jute or it may have been Frisian; they may
have been distinct from certain allied conquerors
known under the name of <i>Saxon</i>, or they may be
the Saxons of a previous period.</p>

<p>They seem, however, in reality, to have been
Norwegians from Norway rather than Danes from
Jutland and the Danish Isles; Norwegians, unaccompanied
by females, and Norwegians who
preserve their separate nationality to a very inconsiderable
extent. They formed French alliances,
and they adopted the habits and manners
of the natives. These were, from first to last,
Keltic on the mother's side; but on that of the
father, Keltic, Roman, and German. That this
latter element was important, is inferred from the
names of the Ducal and Royal family: William,
Richard, Henry, &amp;c., names as little Scandinavian
as they are Roman or Gallic.</p>

<p>Hence, the blood of even the true Norman was
heterogeneous; whilst (more than this) the army
itself was only partially levied on the soil of
Normandy&mdash;Bretons, who were nearly pure Kelts,
Flemings who were Kelto-Germans, and Walloons
who were Kelto-German and Roman, all
helped to swell the host of the Conqueror. What
these effected at Hastings, and how they appropriated
the country, is a matter for the civil<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
rather than the physical historian; the distribution
of their blood amongst the present Englishmen
being a problem for the herald and genealogist.
The elements they brought over were
only what we had before&mdash;Keltic, Roman, German,
and Norse. The manner, however, of their
combination differed. There was also a slight
variation in the German blood. It was Frank
rather than Angle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Kelts, Romans, Germans, and Scandinavians,
then, supply us with the chief elements of our
population, elements which are mixed up with
each other in numerous degrees of combination;
in so many, indeed, that in the case of the last
three there is no approach to purity.</p>

<p>However easy it may be, either amongst the
Gaels of Connaught, or the Cambro-Britons of
North-Wales, to find a typical and genuine Kelt,
the German, equally genuine and typical, whom
writers love to place in contrast with him, is not
to be found within the four seas, the nearest approach
being the Frisian of Friesland.</p>

<p>It is important, too, to remember that the mixture
that has already taken place still goes on; and
as three pure sources of Keltic, without a corresponding
spring of Gothic, blood are in full flow,
the result is a slow but sure addition of Keltic
elements to the so-called Anglo-Saxon stock,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
elements which are perceptible in Britain, and
which are very considerable in America. The
Gael or Briton who marries an English wife,
transmits, on his own part, a pure Keltic strain,
whereas no Englishman can effect a similar infusion
of Germanism&mdash;his own breed being more
or less hybrid.</p>

<p>The previous pages have dealt with the retrospect
of English ethnology. The chief questions
in the prospect are the one just indicated and
the effects of change of area in the case of the
Americans.</p>

scientific merits&mdash;though these, as we have in part shewn, are great and
signal&mdash;but because it is popularly written throughout, and therefore likely
to excite general attention to a subject which ought to be held as one of
primary importance. Every one is interested about fishes&mdash;the political
economist, the epicure, the merchant, the man of science, the angler, the
poor, the rich. We hail the appearance of this book as the dawn of a new
era in the Natural History of England."&mdash;<i>Quarterly Review</i>, No. 116.</small></p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
