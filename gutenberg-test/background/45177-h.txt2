To my father, Rev. Geo. H. Peeke, whose
vote followed his prayers, this little book
is dedicated, except the chapter on the
"Church and the Clergy," which is dedicated
to that large majority of the ministry
who vote one way and pray the opposite, as
their clerical forefathers did. These pages
are not written to prove any theory or fact
except the growth of sentiment in the last
two centuries against the liquor traffic.
Though prepared somewhat as a lawyer
briefs a case, omitting for the most part
the citation of authorities, no fact is given
that does not rest on the authority of some
writer. The authority can be produced if
required. The research represents the culling
of some four hundred volumes.


H. L. Peeke




The reprint of Ebrietatis Encomium,
London, 1723, led many of my friends to
suggest the desirability of a more modern
work on the later views and customs concerning
drunkenness. Thanks to the most
timely and exceptional research of the author,
I present for their delectation a treatise
along this very line, which will pleasantly
while away a winter evening.

CHAPTER I

Customs Based on Race Source of
Population

In order to understand the laws, social
habits, and customs in regard to the use of
liquor it seems proper to consider briefly the
sources of the population of the different
states and of the country generally. At the
time when America was settled, no European
people drank water as we do today for
a constant beverage. The English drank
ale, the Dutch beer, the French and Spanish
light wines, for every day use. Hence it
seemed to the colonists a dangerous experiment
to drink water in the New World.
The Dutch were great beer drinkers and
quickly established breweries at Albany and
New York. Before the century ended New
Englanders had abandoned the constant
drinking of ale and beer for cider. Cider
was very cheap; but a few shillings a barrel.14
It was supplied in large amounts to students
at college and even very little children
drank it. President John Adams was an
early and earnest wisher for temperance reform;
but, to the end of his life, he drank a
large tankard of hard cider every morning
when he first got up. It was free in every
farmhouse to all travelers and tramps. As
years passed on and great wealth came to
individuals the tables of the opulent Dutch
rivalled the luxury of English and French
houses of wealth. When Doctor Cutler
dined with Colonel Duer in New York in
1787 there were fifteen kinds of wine served,
besides beer, cider, and porter. In the
Dutch cellar might be found apples, parsnips,
turnips, etc., along with barrels of
vinegar, cider, and ale, and canty brown
jugs of rum. In the houses of the wealthier
classes there was also plenty of wine, either
of the claret family or some kind of sack,
which was a name covering sherries, canaries,
and madeiras. Teetotalism would have
been quite unintelligible to the farmer or
burgher of those healthy days of breezy activity
out of doors. In the Dutch cupboard15
or on the sideboard always stood the gleaming
decanter of cut-glass or the square high-shouldered
magnum of aromatic schnapps.
The drinking habits of the Dutch colonists
were excessive. Tempered in their tastes
somewhat by the universal brewing and
drinking of beer, they did not use as much
as the Puritans of New England, nor drink
as deeply as the Virginia planters, but the
use of liquor was universal. A libation was
poured on every transaction at every happening
of the community; in public as well
as private life John Barleycorn was a witness
at the drawing of a contract, the signing
of a deed, the selling of a farm, the purchase
of goods, the arbitration of a suit. If a
party backed out from a contract he did not
back out from the treat. Liquor was served
at vendues and made the bidders expansive.
It appeared at weddings, funerals, church
openings, deacon ordainings, and house raisings.
No farm hand in haying, no sailor
on a vessel, no workman in a mill, no cobbler,
tailor, carpenter, mason, or tinker
would work without some strong drink or
treat. The bill for liquor where many16
workmen were employed at a house raising
was often a heavy one.

As to New England, Eugene Lawrence
in his papers on colonial progress, says,
"wines and liquors were freely consumed
by our ancestors and even New England
had as yet (1775) no high repute for temperance.
Rum was taken as a common
restorative." The Puritans had no objection
to wine, and in latter colonial times
hard drinking was very common even
among ministers; but they were much opposed
to health drinking which was too
jovial and pleasant to suit their gloomy
principles. Doctor Peters thus speaks of
Connecticut:

"The various fruits are in greater perfection
than in England. The peach and apple
are more luscious, beautiful, and large; one
thousand peaches are produced from one
tree; five or six barrels of cider from one apple
tree. Cider is the common drink at the
table. The inhabitants have a method of
purifying cider by frost and separating the
watery part from the spirit, which, being secured
in proper vessels and colored by Indian17
corn, becomes, in three months so much
like Madeira wine, that Europeans drink it
without perceiving the difference. They
make peachy and perry, grape and currant
wines, and good beers of pumpkin, molasses,
bran of wheat, spruce, and malt."

Perry was made from pears, as cider is
from apples, and peachy from peaches.
Metheglin and mead, drinks of the old
Druids in England, were made from honey,
yeast, and water. In Virginia whole plantations
of the honey locust furnished locust
beans for making metheglin. From persimmons,
elderberries, juniper berries,
pumpkins, cornstalks, hickory nuts, sassafras
bark, birch bark, and many other leaves
and roots various light wines were made.
An old song boasted:



Oh we can make liquor to sweeten our lips
Of pumpkins, of parsnips, of walnut-tree chips.



Beer was brewed in families, and the orchards
soon yielded an abundance of cider.
In 1721 the production of cider increased so
that one village of forty families made three
thousand barrels, and in 1728 Judge Joseph18
Wilder, of Lancaster, made six hundred and
sixteen barrels himself.

When the Quakers framed their constitution
for Pennsylvania they inserted clauses
punishing swearing, intemperance, cardplaying,
and the drinking of healths. They
were mighty drinkers in their sober fashion,
consuming vast quantities of ale and spirits,
and making no serious inroads on the pure
and wholesome water, although we are
gravely assured that particular pumps, one
on Walnut Street, and one in Norris Alley,
were held in especial favor as having the
best water in town for the legitimate purpose
of boiling greens. Their first beer was
made from molasses, and we have Penn's
assurance that, when "well boyled with Sassafras
or Pine infused into it," this was a
very tolerable drink. Rum punch was also
in liberal demand, and after a few years the
thirsty colonists began to brew ale, and
drank it out of deep pewter mugs.

When Congress met in 1774, in Philadelphia,
John Adams was shocked by the display
of eatables. His appetite overcame his
scruples, although after each feast he19
scourged himself for yielding. After dining
with Mr. Miers, a young Quaker lawyer,
Adams remarks in his diary:

"A mighty feast again; nothing less than
the very best of Claret, Madeira, and Burgundy.
I drank Madeira at a great rate
and found no inconvenience. This plain
Friend and his plain though pretty wife,
with her Thees and Thous, had provided us
the most costly entertainment, ducks, hams,
chickens, beef, pig, tarts, creams, custards,
jellies, fools, trifles, floating islands, beer,
porter, punch, wine, etc."

Again after dining at Mr. Powell's:

"A most sinful feast again: Everything
which could delight the eye, or allure the
taste, curds, and creams, jellies, sweetmeats
of various kinds, twenty sorts of tarts, fools,
trifles, floating islands, whipped syllabubs,
etc. Parmesan cheese, punch, wine, porter,
beer, etc."

The Swedes planted peach and fruit trees
of all kinds, had flourishing gardens, and
grew rich selling the products when the
Quakers arrived. They made wine, beer, or
brandy out of sassafras, persimmons, corn,20
and apparently anything that could be made
to ferment and they imported Madeira.
Acrelius, their historian, gives a long list of
their drinks, and tells us that they always indulged
in four meals a day.

In the True and Sincere Declaration, issued
in December, 1609, by the Governor
and Council for Virginia, there was an advertisement
for two brewers, who, as soon
as they were secured, were to be dispatched
to the Colony. Brewers were also included
among the tradesmen who were designed
by the Company to go over with
Sir Thomas Gates. This indicated the
importance in the eyes of that corporation
of establishing the means in Virginia
of manufacturing malt liquors on the spot
instead of relying on the importation from
England. The notion arose that one of
the principal causes of mortality so prevalent
among those arriving in the Colony,
in the period following the first settlement
of the country, was the substitution of
water for beer to which the immigrants had
been accustomed in England. The Assembly,
in the session of 1623, went so far as to21
recommend that all new comers should
bring in a supply of malt to be used in brewing
liquor, thus making it unnecessary to
drink the water of Virginia until the body
had become hardened to the climate. Previous
to 1625, two brew-houses were in operation
in the Colony, and the patronage
they received was evidently very liberal.

Cider was in as common use as beer; in
season it was found in the house of every
planter in the Colony. It was the form
of consideration in which rent was occasionally
settled; the instance of Alexander
Moore, of New York, shows the
quantity often bequeathed: he left at his
decease twenty gallons of raw cider and
one hundred and thirty of boiled. Richard
Moore of the same county kept on hand
as many as fourteen cider casks. Richard
Bennett made about twenty butts of cider
annually, while Richard Kinsman compressed
from the pears growing in his orchard
forty or fifty of perry. A supply of
spirits was provided for the members of
public bodies when they convened. The
character of the liquors used depended on22
the nature of the assemblage. When Charles
Hansford and David Condon, as executors of
the widow of the unfortunate Thomas Hansford,
leased her residence in York to the
justice of the peace of that county to serve
as a court house, they bound themselves to
furnish not only accommodations for horses,
but also a gallon of brandy during each session
of the bench. It is not stated whether
this brandy was consumed by the honorable
justices in the form of the drink which had
become so famous in later times in Virginia,
the mint julep, but if mint was cultivated in
the colony at that age, it is quite probable
that a large part of this gallon was converted
into that mixture. In 1666 the justices
of Lower Norfolk county rented the tract of
land on which the court house was situated,
on condition that the lessee, in part consideration
for the use of the houses and orchards
each year, would pay ten gallons brewed
from English grain. The members of the
Council appear to have been fastidious in
their tastes. It was one of the duties of the
auditor-general to have a large quantity of
wine always ready at hand for this body.23
Thus on one occasion William Byrd, who
filled the office in the latter part of the century,
ordered for their use twenty dozen of
claret, and six dozen of canary, sherry, and
Rhenish, respectively. A quarter of a cask
of brandy was also to be added.

CHAPTER II

Early Attempts at Regulation by Legislation

This unrestrained indulgence in liquor,
which previous to 1624 had excited the criticism
of the company, called down on the
Colony on several occasions the animadversion
of the Royal Governor after he had
taken charge of affairs in Virginia. In 1625
Governor Yeardley was instructed to suppress
drunkenness by severe punishments,
and to dispose of the spirits brought into the
Colony in such manner that it would go to
the relief and comfort of the whole plantation
instead of falling into the hands of
those who would abuse it. He received additional
orders to return to the importers all
liquors shown to be decayed or unwholesome.
The injunction to withhold all liquors
imported into the Colony from persons who
were guilty of excess in the use of them was
repeated.

The attempts to prevent drunkenness were25
not confined to instructions to the Governors,
given by the authorities in England.
From the first session of the first assembly,
no legislative means were left unemployed
to accomplish the same object. In 1619 it
was provided that the person guilty in this
respect should for the first offense be privately
reproved by his minister; for the second,
publicly; for the third be imprisoned
for twelve hours; and if still incorrigible be
punished as the Governor directed.

In March, 1623-4, the church-wardens in
every parish were ordered to present all persons
guilty of drunkenness to the commander
of the plantation. In 1631-2 the offender
was required to pay five shillings into the
hands of the nearest vestry, and this fine
could be made good by levy on his property.
In 1657-8 the person guilty of inebriety was
punished by a very heavy fine, and also rendered
incapable of being a witness in court,
or bearing office under the government of
the Colony. In 1691 the penalty for drunkenness
was ten shillings, and if unable to pay
the sum, the offender was to be exposed in
the stocks for the space of two hours.

26
In 1668 there were so many taverns and
tippling houses in the Colony that it was
found necessary to reduce the number in
each county to one or two, unless, for the accommodation
of travelers, more should be
needed at ports, ferries, and the crossings of
great roads, in addition to that which was
erected at the court house.

Drunkards were severely punished and
were set in the stocks and whipped. On
September 3, 1633, in Boston one Robert
Coles was "fined ten shillings and enjoined
to stand with a white sheet of paper on his
back, whereon Drunkard shall be written in
great lynes, and to stand therewith soe long
as the court find meet, for abusing himself
shamefully with drinke." Robert Coles for
"drunkenness by him committed at Rocksbury
shall be disfranchised, weare about his
neck, and so to hang upon his outward garment
a D made of redd cloth       sett upon
white; to continue this for a yeare,       not to
have it off any time hee comes among company,
under the penalty of one shilling for
the first offense, and five pounds for the second,
and afterwards to be punished by the27
Court as they think meet: also he is to weare
the D outwards."

Lists of names of common drunkards were
given to landlords in some towns, and landlords
were warned not to sell liquor to them.
Licenses were removed and fines imposed
on those who did not heed the warning. The
tithing man, that most bumptious public
functionary of colonial times, was at first
the official appointed to spy specially on the
ordinaries. He inspected these houses, made
complaints of any disorders he discovered,
and gave into the constable the names of
idle drinkers and gamers. He warned the
keepers of public houses to sell no more
liquor to any whom he fancied had been
tippling too freely.

John Josslyn, an English visitor in Boston
in 1663, complained bitterly thus:

"At houses of entertainment into which a
stranger went, he was presently followed by
one appointed to that office, who would
thrust himself into the company uninvited,
and if he called for more drink than the
officer thought in his judgment he could soberly
bear away, he would presently countermand28
it, and appoint the proportion, beyond
which he could not get one drop."

The prisons found little occupation as
compared with the pillory and the whipping
post. The latter was the common corrector
of drunkenness. We have an amusing description
of what constitutes drunkenness,
from Colonel Dodberry: "Now for to know
a drunken man the better, the Scriptures describes
them to stagger and reel to and fro;
and so when the same legs which carry a
man into the house can not bring him out
again, it is a sufficient sign of drunkenness."

In 1676, during the supremacy of Nathaniel
Bacon, at which time so many laws
were passed for the purpose of suppressing
long standing abuses, a legislative attempt
was made to enforce what practically
amounted to general prohibition. The licenses
of all inns, alehouses, and tippling houses,
except those at James City, and at
the two great ferries of York River, were
revoked. The keepers of the ordinaries
which were permitted to remain open at the
latter places were allowed to sell only beer
and cider. This regulation was remarkable29
in that it was adopted by the action of the
people, who must have been the principal
customers of the tippling houses, if not of
the inns. Not content with putting a stop to
sales in public places, the framers of the
regulation further prescribed that "no one
should presume to sell any sort of drink
whatsoever, by retail, under any color, pretence,
delusion, or subtle evasion whatsoever,
to be drunk or spent in his or their
house or houses, upon his or their plantation
or plantations."

The general court of Massachusetts on
one occasion required the proper officers
to notice the apparel of the people, especially
their "ribbands and great boots." Drinking
of healths in public or private; funeral
badges; celebrating the church festivals of
Christmas and Easter; and many other
things that seemed quite improper to magistrates
and legislators, and especially to the
Puritan clergy, were forbidden.

In Pennsylvania men were imprisoned in
a cage seven feet high, seven feet wide, and
seven feet long, for selling liquor to the
Indians and for watering the white man's30
rum, both of which offences the law placed
on equal footing.

Virginia and New Jersey declared liquor
debts uncollectible by law.

Several of the colonies forbade workmen
to be paid in liquor. In Massachusetts, in
1764, the law required that all who bought
liquor should render an account of it except
state officers, professors and students of
Harvard College, and preachers of the gospel.

The law frequently manifested great concern
about the clergy. Virginia had a statute
making it an offence for a minister to
appear drunk in his pulpit on Sunday, and
in addition the following statute:

"Ministers shall not give themselves to
excess in drinking or riot, spending their
time idly by day or by night, playing at dice,
cards, or any unlawful game, but at all times
convenient they shall hear or read some
what of the Holy Scriptures."

It is one of the curiosities of old time legislation
that the use of tobacco was in earliest
colonial days plainly regarded by the magistrates
and elders as far more sinful, degrading,31
and harmful than indulgence in intoxicating
liquors. No one could take tobacco
"publicquely" nor in his own house, or anywhere
else before strangers. Two men were
forbidden to smoke together. No one could
smoke within two miles of the meeting
house on the Sabbath day. There were
wicked backsliders who were caught smoking
around the corner of the meeting house,
and others in the street, and they were fined
and set in the stocks and in cages.

Tariffs

After the thirteen colonies had formed "a
more perfect union" the question of revenue
caused a heated discussion. Of the many
ways through which a sure revenue might
flow into the treasury none seemed as desirable
as an impost. Of molasses, two millions
of gallons came into the country each
year. A few hundreds of thousands of these
were consumed as food. The remainder
were hurried to the Massachusetts distilleries
and there made into the far-famed New
England rum, which by the fishermen at the
Grand Banks was thought much finer than32
the best that came from Jamaica. All other
goods brought into any port in the country
were to be taxed at five per cent of their
value.

A long list of articles was given on which
special duties were to be paid. At the head
of the list stood Jamaica rum, which on motion
was changed to distilled spirits of Jamaica
proof. Two duties were suggested,
one of fifteen cents on the gallon, which
speedily divided the committee. Some
thought such rates too high. Some declared
they were much too low. And before the
discussion had gone far it turned into a debate
on the good and ill effects of high duties
and low duties. One low tariff member
remarked that the first thing to be considered
in laying a tax was the likelihood of
gathering it, and that as taxes increased this
likelihood decreased. "I trust," said he,
"it does not need illustration to convince
every member of the committee that a high
duty is a very strong temptation to smuggling.
Just in the proportion which a tax
bears to the value of an article is the risk
men will run in their attempts to bring in33
that article in an illegal way. This impairs
the revenue, and in time so much
comes in through the hands of smugglers
that no revenue is yielded at all." Boudinot
said "he for one would be glad to see
Jamaica rum doing just that very thing."
There were three good results that would
come of a high rum tariff: The treasury
wanted money, and surely there was no article
on the lists of taxable goods so likely to
furnish a revenue as rum; the importation
would be discouraged, and that was beneficial
to the morals of the people; the West
Indian distilleries would have no inducement
to turn their molasses into rum, and
as they had no markets for molasses save
those of the United States, the home stills
would be set actively to work.

These remarks on the moral effects of the
tax were violently attacked by two members
from the eastward. Fisher Ames quite forgot
himself, and reminded the committee,
with great vehemence of gesture and speech,
that they were not in church or at school, to
sit listening to harangues of speculative
piety. We are, exclaimed he, to talk of the34
political interests committed to our care.
When we take up the subject of morality
then let our system look toward morality,
and not confound itself with revenue and
the protection of manufactures. If any
man supposes that a mere law can turn the
taste of a people from ardent spirits to malt
liquors, he has a most romantic notion of
legislative power. Lawrence, one of the
members from New York, took up the attack.
He was for low tariff. "If," said
he, "the committee is to reason and act as
moralists, the arguments of the member
from New Jersey are sound. For it must
be the wish of every man of sense to discourage
the use of articles so ruinous to
health and morals as rum. But we are to
act as politicians, not as moralists. Rum,
not morality, is to be taxed. Money, not
sobriety, is the object of the tax."

The justness of this reasoning was lost on
the committee, and spirits of Jamaica proof
were taxed at fifteen cents a gallon. The
duty finally levied on all distilled spirits was
due to the influence of Hamilton, whose first35
tariff bill also imposed a duty on glass,
"with the significant reservation," as Blaine
states, "in deference to popular habits that
black quart bottles should be admitted free."

Internal Revenue Tax

The system of internal taxation by the
federal government began on that memorable
day in 1791 when Washington signed
the bill laying a duty on domestic distilled
spirits; a tax which, proving more harsh in
its operations than was expected, was amended
in 1792, and after being denounced by
legislatures and by mass meetings as oppressive,
unequal, and unjust, was openly
resisted by the people of western Pennsylvania,
who rose in armed rebellion in 1794.
In that same year taxes were laid on licenses
for retailing wine and liquor, and on the
manufacture of snuff, tobacco, and refined
sugar, on carriages, and on sales at auction.

In 1801 the taxes on carriages, on licenses
for retailing liquor, on snuff and refined
sugar, on sales at auction, when about to expire,
were continued without a time limit;36
but the next year the republicans were in
control, and every kind of internal tax was
abolished with exultation.

With this record behind them the two parties
met in the extra session of the thirteenth
congress and changed places. The federalists
became the enemies of taxation; the republicans
became its advocates, and before
the session ended taxed pleasure carriages,
sales at auction, sugar refineries, salt, licenses
to sell liquor at retail; laid a stamp tax on all
kinds of legal documents, taxed whiskey
stills, imposed a direct tax of three million
dollars and brought back all the machinery
of assessment and collection, and again
turned loose in the land the tax gatherer and
what they had once called his minions. As
some months must necessarily pass before any
money could be raised from these sources,
another loan of seven million and a half was
authorized. From this time until the present
liquor has been constantly taxed both by
state and nation, and has been relied on to
furnish a large part of the public revenue.

CHAPTER III

Schools and Colleges

What the common schools of a century or
two ago must have been is indicated by a description
of the colleges which will hereafter
be given in this chapter. Many of the
school-masters were ignorant, and in addition
were much addicted to the use of intoxicating
liquors. The first of whom we have
any trace was Jan Roelandsen, a New York
school-master, who is on record as lying
drunk for a month at a time, and being incorrigibly
lazy. He was the first of many.
Winthrop, in his History of New England,
describes the censuring of Nathaniel Eton,
a school-master, for furnishing insufficient
board to his scholars, in which proceeding
his wife testified that the bread and beer was
always free for the boarders to go to. In
1693 a school bill for a couple of boys of the
Lloyd family of Long Island contained the
following items:



  
    A bottle of wine for his mistress
    10 d.
  
    Wormwood and rubab
    6 d.


38
While the boys took the drugs the school-mistress
drank the wine.

Henry Clay's education was in a district
school taught in a log cabin by an intemperate
Englishman, and consisted of the merest
rudiments. Peter Cartwright speaks of his
school teacher as a Seceder minister who
would get drunk at times. Washington
Irving's Ichabod Crane, and Eggleston's
Hoosier School-master are at least average
pictures of the country school-masters of an
early day. The chorus of the school-masters
seems to have been:



"Let schoolmasters puzzle their brains
With grammar and nonsense and learning,
Good liquor I stoutly maintain
Gives genius a better discerning."



MacMasters describes early college life
in 1784 as follows:

"The students lodged in the dormitories
and ate at the commons. The food then
partaken of with thankfulness would now
be looked upon as prison fare. At breakfast,
which was served at sunrise in summer
and at day-break in winter, there was doled
out to each student a small can of unsettled39
coffee, a size of biscuit, and a size of butter
weighing generally about an ounce. Dinner
was the staple meal, and at this each student
was regaled with a pound of meat.
Two days in the week, Monday and Thursday,
the meat was boiled, and, in college
language, these were known as boiling days.
On the five remaining days, the meat was
roasted, and to them the nickname of roasting
days were fastened. With the flesh always
went potatoes. When boiling days
came round, pudding and cabbage, wild
peas and dandelions were added. The only
delicacy to which no stint was applied was
the cider, a beverage then fast supplanting
the small beer of the colonial days. This
was brought to the mess in pewter cans
which were passed from mouth to mouth,
and when emptied were again replenished.
For supper there was a bowl of milk and a
size of bread."

The oldest college in the United States,
that of William and Mary, was founded by
the King and Queen of that name, who gave
it twenty thousand acres of land and a penny
a pound duty on tobacco exported from Virginia40
and Maryland. The assembly also
gave it a duty on imported liquors for its
support. This was in 1726, and the proceeds
of the tax were to be devoted to its
running expenses and the establishment of
scholarships. Twenty-five years later the
same benevolent body enriched the college
with the proceeds of the tax on peddlers.
Those who are inclined to throw stones at
the source of these benefactions should remember
that Harvard College has more
than once profited by the gains of an authorized
lottery, receiving more than eighteen
thousand dollars from such a source as late
as 1805.

In 1752 the rules of William and Mary
College required that "spirituous liquors
were to be used in that moderation which
became the prudent and industrious student."
From the list were excluded all
liquids but beer, cider, toddy, and spirits
and water. In 1798, when the Bishop of
Virginia was president of the college and
had apartments in the building, the English
traveler Weld noticed that half a dozen or41
more of the students dined at his table
one day when he was there. "Some were
without shoes and stockings, others without
coats. During the meal they constantly rose
to help themselves from the sideboard."

William and Mary College, during the
days of Jefferson and Monroe, was "a riot
of pleasure and power, a jumble of royalist
splendor and patriotic fervor, an awe of
learning, and indulgence of vice." Thomas
Jefferson, the most eminent graduate of
the college, and its cordial friend, in advanced
life remembered the "regular annual
riot and battles between the students
and the town boys;" and bore testimony to
other greater evils. From one source and
another have come down to us complaints
that the college was neither a college, nor a
grammar school, nor an Indian hospital;
that its teachers squabbled among themselves
to the detriment of their academic
work; and that some of the professors sent
out by the bishops of London were drunken,
quarrelsome, and ignorant of the subjects
they professed to teach.

42
The president, representing the bishop,
might have brought charges against the
clergy for their flagrant drunkenness but he
refrained, being himself a notorious drunkard.
Farquier, representative of the crown,
was the most finished gentleman Virginia
had known, and also the most demoralizing.
He introduced a passion for high play that
ruined many a fine old family, encouraged
hard drinking and a mania for racing, delighted
in having the clergy and favored
students join him in his all-night revels.

Commencement at Harvard in Old New
England days was a fête indeed; a fête so
important as to be attended by giant expenditures
and sinful extravagance. Indeed,
so early as 1722 in its history, an act was
passed "that henceforth no preparation nor
provision of either Plumb Cake, or Roasted,
Boyled or Baked Meats or Pyes of any kind
shall be made by any Commencer," and that
"no such have any distilled liquors in his
Chamber or any composition therewith,"
under penalty of twenty shillings or forfeiture
of the said provisions. Five years later43
several acts were passed "for preventing the
Excesses, Immoralities and Disorders of the
Commencements," by way of enforcing the
foregoing act. These, with a simplicity of
conclusion which brings a smile, declare
that "if any who now doe or hereafter shall
stand for their degrees, presume to doe anything
contrary to the said Act or goe about
to evade it by Plain Cake," they shall forfeit
the honors of the college.

In the latter part of the eighteenth century
the Yale College butler held his buttery
in the ground floor, front corner room, of
South Middle College, and sold cider,
metheglin, strong beer, together with loaf
sugar, etc., to the students. Dr. Lyman
Beecher, in his autobiography, says of old
Doctor Dwight, then president of the college:
"Before he came college was in a
most ungodly state.... Wine and liquor
were kept in many rooms, intemperance,
profanity, gambling, and licentiousness were
common."

John Bacon, afterwards United States
Senator, and Chief Justice of New Hampshire,44
sailed from Boston for Princeton College
September 10, 1751. In his diary he
states his outfit.



  
    5 qts West India rum

In a book published in 1764 describing
student life at Princeton, it is stated that
"the general table drink is beer or cider."

Washington Irving, in Salmagundi, described
seeing two students at the tavern at
Princeton who got drunk and cursed the
professors. Madison was a poler at Princeton,
and although the five o'clock horn was
a sovereign preventive of midnight revelry,
Madison was occasionally found around the
blazing logs of the Nassau Inn, when tankards
of ale and puffs at the long stemmed
pipes punctuated the students' songs.

James Buchanan at Dickinson was the
typical bad boy. Immorality was rampant
among the students, sobriety and books were
ridiculed. Buchanan became a leader in45
debauchery, although his physique enabled
him at the same time to maintain a high
rank in scholarship. The faculty chose him
as a scapegoat, and he was expelled.

Benny Havens, the hero of the West Point
song, for many years sold liquor illicitly to
the cadets. The foundation of Vassar College
was the fortune acquired by Matthew
Vassar as a brewer.



46

CHAPTER IV

Bench and Bar

The field which then lay before the
ablest lawyers was far less extensive and far
less lucrative than at present. Thousands of
cases now arise which could not then have
possibly arisen. No wealthy corporations
existed, expending each year in lawyers' fees
enough money to have paid the taxes of the
four colonies of New England. Patent law
and railroad law, the business of banks and
insurance companies, express companies,
telegraph companies, and steamships, have
given rise to legal questions of which neither
Parsons, nor Tudor, nor Dexter had any
conception whatever. A fee of $20,000 was
unknown; a suit involving $50,000,000 was
unheard of. Yet the profession was not ill-paid
and offered many incentives to bright
young men. The law student of that day
usually began by offering his services to47
some lawyer of note, and if they were accepted
he paid a fee of a hundred dollars,
and began to read law books and copy briefs.
In the course of two years he was expected to
have become familiar with Coke on Littleton,
with Wood's Institutes of Civil Law,
with Piggot on Conveyances, with Burns's
Justice of the Peace, with Hawkin's Pleas
of the Crown, with Salkeld's Reports, with
Lillie's Abridgements, and with some work
on chancery practice and some work on what
would now be called international law.
This accomplished, his patron would take
him into court, seat him at the lawyers' table,
whisper to the gentlemen present, and with
their consent would rise and ask leave of the
court to present a young man for the oath of
an attorney. The court would ask if the bar
consented. The lawyers would then bow.
The patron would vouch for the morals and
learning of his young friend, and the oath
would be administered by the clerk. This
done, the new attorney would be introduced
to the bar and carried off to the nearest tavern
where health and prosperity would be
drunk to him in bumpers of strong punch.

48
Thaddeus Stevens has left an amusing account
of his brief connection, about 1820,
with the Maryland bar. The examination
took place in the evening before the judge
and the bar committee. His honor informed
Stevens that there was one indispensable
requisite to the examination. "There must
be two bottles of Madeira on the table and
the applicant must order it in." Stevens
complied with the condition, and, after the
wine had been disposed of, one of the committee
asked the applicant what books he
had read. He replied, "Blackstone, Coke
upon Littleton, a work on Pleading, and
Gilbert on Evidence." He was then asked
two or three questions, the last of which related
to the difference between executory
devises and a contingent remainder. A satisfactory
answer to this question led his
honor again to intervene. "Gentlemen,"
said the judge, "you see the young man is
all right. I will give him a certificate."
But before the certificate was delivered, the
candidate was informed that usage required
that the ceremony should terminate in the
same way it had opened, and that two more49
bottles must be produced. Stevens very willingly
complied with this requirement and
was made a member of the bar.

With such a bar the courts were rude and
primitive. The courts sat often times in
taverns, where the tedium of business was
relieved by glasses of grog, while the judge's
decisions were not put on record, but were
simply shouted by the crier from the inn
door at the nearest market place. In North
Carolina the laws were not printed for a
long time but only read aloud in the market
place, and the courts and legislature met in
private houses and taverns.

Probably the best type of the judges produced
by this system was old Chief Justice
Marshall, who occupied the highest seat in
the Supreme Court of the United States for
35 years. His decisions were recorded and
will be the noblest monument a man could
have or wish. In reference to two of them,
Judge Story says: "If all the acts of his
judicial life or arguments had perished, his
luminous judgments on these occasions
would give an enviable immortality to his
name." Judge Story said of the mode of life50
of the judges at these general terms of the
court:

"Our intercourse is perfectly familiar and
unrestrained, and our social hours, when undisturbed
with the labors of law, are passed
in gay and frank conversation, which at
once enlivens and instructs. We take no
part in Washington society. We dine once
a year with the President, and that is all.
On other days we dine together, and discuss
at table the questions which are argued before
us. We are great ascetics and even
deny ourselves wine except in wet weather.
What I say about the wine gives you our
rule; but it does sometimes happen that the
Chief Justice will say to me, when the cloth
is removed, 'Brother Story, step to the window
and see if it does not look like rain.'
And if I tell him the sun is shining brightly,
Justice Marshall will sometimes reply, 'All
the better, for our jurisdiction extends over
so large a territory that the doctrine of
chances makes it certain that it must be raining
somewhere.' The Chief was brought up
on Federalism and Madeira, and he is not
the man to outgrow his early prejudices.51
The best Madeira was that labelled 'The Supreme
Court,' as their Honors, the Justices,
used to make a direct importation every
year, and sip it as they consulted over the
cases before them every day after dinner,
when the cloth had been removed."

Returning to lawyers, Henry Clay was
extremely convivial, keenly enjoying the society
of his friends. He was fastidious in
his tastes though far from being an epicure.
He indulged moderately in wine, took snuff,
and used tobacco freely. In earlier days he
lost and won large sums of money at play
but ceased the practice of gaming in consequence
of censure, though he remained inveterately
fond of whist.

Webster was majestic in his consumption
of liquor as in everything else. Parton in
his Essay speaks of seeing Webster at a public
dinner "with a bottle of Madeira under
his yellow waistcoat and looking like Jove."
Schuyler Colfax frequently spoke of seeing
Webster so drunk that he did not know what
he was doing. Josiah Quincy describes
Webster's grief at the burning of his house
because of the loss of half a pipe of Madeira52
wine. John Sherman in his Recollections
describes hearing Webster deliver a speech
at a public dinner when intoxicated.

"In ante-bellum days, at this season of the
year, when there was a long session, a party
went down the Potomac every Saturday on
the steamboat Salem to eat planked shad.
It was chiefly composed of Senators and
Representatives, with a few leading officials,
some prominent citizens, and three or four
newspaper men, who in those days never
violated the amenities of social life by printing
what they heard there. An important
house in Georgetown would send on board
the steamer large demijohns filled with the
best wines and liquors, which almost everybody
drank without stint. Going down the
river there was a good deal of card playing
in the upper saloon of the boat, with some
story telling on the hurricane deck. Arriving
at the white house fishing grounds, some
would go on shore, some would watch the
drawing of the seine from the boat, some
would take charge of the culinary department,
and a few would remain at the card
tables. The oaken planks used were about53
two inches thick, fourteen inches wide, and
two feet long. These were scalded and
then wiped dry. A freshly caught shad was
then taken, scaled, split open down the back,
cleaned, washed and dried. It was then
spread out on a plank and nailed to it with
iron pump tacks. The plank with the fish
on it was then stood at an angle of forty-five
degrees before a hot wood fire and baked until
it was a rich dark brown color, an attendant
turning the plank every few moments
and basting the fish with a thin mixture of
melted butter and flour. Meanwhile an experienced
cook was frying fresh shad roe in
a mixture of eggs and cracker dust at another
fire. The planked shad, meanwhile,
were served on the planks on which they had
been cooked, each person having a plank and
picking out what portion he liked best,
breaking up his roast potato on the warm
shad, while the roe was also served to those
who wished for it. After the fish came
punch and cigars and then they reëmbarked
and the bows of the steamer were turned
toward Washington. When opposite Alexandria
an account was taken of the liquor54
and wine which had been drunk, and an
assessment was levied, which generally
amounted to about $2.00 each. I never saw
a person intoxicated at one of these shad
bakes, nor heard any quarreling."

It is said that Webster went fishing the day
before he was to deliver his welcome to Lafayette,
and got drunk. As he sat on the bank
he suddenly drew from the water a large
fish and in his majestic voice said, "Welcome,
illustrious stranger, to our shores."
The next day his friends, who went fishing
with him, were electrified to hear him begin
his speech to Lafayette with these same
words.



55

CHAPTER V

Church and Clergy

The first tavern at Cambridge, Massachusetts,
was kept by a deacon of the church,
afterwards, steward of Harvard college;
and the relation of tavern and meeting house
did not end with their simultaneous establishment,
but they continued the most friendly
neighbors. Licenses to keep houses of
entertainment were granted with the condition
that the tavern must be near the meeting-house       a
keen contrast to our present
laws prohibiting the sale of liquor within
a certain distance of a church. Those
who know the oldtime meeting house can
fully comprehend the desire of the colonists
to have a tavern near at hand, especially
during the winter services. Through
autumn rains and winter frosts and snows
the poorly built meeting house stood unheated,
growing more damp, more icy,56
more deadly, with each succeeding week.
Women cowered shivering, half-frozen, over
the feeble heat of a metal footstove as the
long services dragged on and the few coals
became ashes. Men stamped their feet and
swung their arms in the vain effort to warm
the blood. Gladly and cheerfully did the
whole crowd troop from the gloomy meeting
house to the cheerful tavern to thaw out before
the afternoon service, and to warm up
before the ride or walk home in the late
afternoon. It was a scandal in many a town
that godly church members took too freely
of tavern cheer at the nooning; the only
wonder is that the entire congregation did
not succumb in a body to the potent flip and
toddy of the tavern-keeper. In mid-summer
the hot sun beat down on the meeting house
roof, and the burning rays poured in the unshaded
windows. The tap-room of the tavern
and the green trees in its dooryard offered
a pleasant shade to tired church-goers,
and its well sweep afforded a grateful drink
to those who turned not to the tap-room.
There are ever back-sliders in every church
community; many walked into the ordinary57
door instead of up the church alley. The
chimney seat of the inn was more comfortable
than the narrow seat of the "pue." The
general court of Massachusetts passed a law
requiring all inn-keepers within a mile of
any meeting house to clear their houses
"during the hours of the exercise." "Thus,"
Mr. Field says wittily, "the townsmen were
frozen out of the tavern to be frozen in the
meeting house." Our ancestors had no reverence
for a church save as a literal meeting
house, and it was not unusual to transform
the house of God into a tavern. The Great
House at Charlestown, Massachusetts, the
official residence of Governor Winthrop, became
a meeting house in 1633, and then a
tavern, the Three Cranes, kept by Robert
Leary and his descendants for many years.
It was destroyed in June, 1775, in the burning
of the town.

The first revenue relinquished by the West
India Company to the town of New Amsterdam
was the excise on wine, beer, and spirits,
and the sole condition made by Stuyvesant
on its surrender was as to its application,
that the salaries of the Dominies should58
be paid from it. For a year beginning November,
1661, the burghers of Esopus paid
a tax on liquor, the proceeds of which were
used to build a parsonage for the minister.
St. Philip's church in Charleston, South
Carolina, was originally built by a tax of
two pence a gallon on spirits imported in
1670. Between 1743 and 1750 the public
revenues of South Carolina were all raised
by three per cent duties on liquors, wines,
sugar, molasses, slaves, and imported dry-goods,
and produced about forty-five hundred
pounds, of which one thousand pounds
were devoted to paying the salaries of ten
ministers. The dedication of St. Michael's
church in Charleston, South Carolina, was
followed by a great dinner, at which a large
amount of liquor was consumed.

Under such circumstances it could not be
expected that the clergy would be much
troubled with scruples on the use of liquor,
and the evidence is that they were not. We
must bear in mind that the use of liquors
was universal in those days. "Ordination
Day" was almost as great a day for the tavern
as for the meeting house. The visiting59
ministers who came to assist at the religious
service of ordination of a new minister were
usually entertained at the tavern. Often a
specially good beer was brewed called "ordination
beer," and in Connecticut an "ordination
ball" was given at the tavern       this
with the sanction of the parsons. The
bills for entertaining the visitors for the dinner
and lodging at the local taverns are in
many cases preserved. One of the most
characteristic was at a Hartford ordination.

The bill is endorsed with unconscious humor,

Here is another ordination bill:

    18
    bottles of wine.

When the fathers met in synod at Cambridge
in 1648, there was a liquor bill in
connection with the expense of the meeting.
At the ordination of Edwin Jackson in Woburn,
1729, the town paid for six and one-half
barrels of cider, 25 gallons of wine, 2
gallons of brandy, 4 gallons of rum.

In the South the clergy were addicted to
horse racing, gambling, and drunken revels.
One of them was for many years president of
a Jockey Club. They encouraged among
the people the celebration of the sacrament
of baptism with music and dancing in which
the clergymen took part, a custom which
shows signs of returning in England. One
fought a duel in a churchyard, another
thrashed his vestry. One parson preached
in his stocking feet, one in his study coat,61
and one ran a distillery. Many of them were
appointed by the British government and
by the Bishop of London and they were affected
by the irreligious listlessness and low
moral tone of the English church in the
eighteenth century.

Alexander Graydon tells us that in his
early days any jockeying, fiddling, wine-bibbing
clergyman not over-scrupulous about
stealing sermons was currently known as "a
Maryland Parson." The Maryland clergy
are said to have been more vicious than those
of Virginia. They raced horses, hunted
foxes, drank, gambled, joined in every
amusement of the planters and would extort
marriage fees from the poor by breaking off
in the middle of the service and refusing to
go on until paid.

One Dr. Beatty was acting as chaplain
to an army of five hundred men led by
Franklin to defend the frontier against the
French and Indians after the burning of
the Moravian mission at Gnadenhutten,
Pennsylvania. "Dr. Beatty complained to
me," says Franklin, "that the men did not
generally attend his prayers and exhortations.62
When they were enlisted, they were
promised, besides hay and provisions, a gill
of rum a day, which was punctually served
out to them, half in the morning, and the
other half in the evening; and I observed
they were as punctual in attending to receiving
it; upon which I said to Mr. Beatty, 'It
is perhaps below the dignity of your profession
to act as steward of the rum, but if you
were to deal it out, and only just after prayers
you would have them all about you.'"
The shrewd suggestion was adopted by Dr.
Beatty, and the philosophic Franklin says
"Never were prayers more generally and
punctually attended; so that I thought this
method preferable to the punishment inflicted
by some military laws for non-attendance
at divine service."

This chapter may well be concluded with
the famous and oft quoted letter of Cotton
Mather to John Higginson:



"September ye 15, 1682.

"To ye Aged and Beloved Mr. John Higginson:


"There is now at sea a ship called the
Welcome, which has on board an hundred63
or more of the heretics and malignants
called Quakers, with W. Penn, who is the
chief scamp, at the head of them.

"The general court has accordingly given
secret orders to Master Malachi Huscott, of
the brig Porpoise, to waylay the said Welcome,
slyly, as near the Cape of Cod as may
be, and make captive the said Penn and his
ungodly crew, so that the Lord may be glorified,
and not mocked on the soil of this new
country with the heathen worship of these
people. Much spoil can be made by selling
the whole lot to Barbadoes, where slaves
fetch good prices in rum and sugar, and we
shall not only do the Lord great service by
punishing the wicked, but we shall make
great good for his minister and people.

"Master Huscott feels hopeful, and I will
set down the news when the ship comes back.


"Yours in ye bowels of Christ,
"Cotton Mather."

CHAPTER VI

Relation of George Washington to the
Liquor Traffic

In approaching the study of the character
of Washington a writer should always remember
the veneration in which his memory
is justly held among Americans. The
reader should remember that public sentiment
was then at a very low ebb with regard
to the liquor traffic and neither the drinker
nor seller was discredited by his neighbors
as he is today.

The use of liquor played an important
part in the life of a Virginia planter a century
and a half ago. At all the cross-roads
and court-houses there sprang up taverns or
ordinaries, and in these the men of a neighborhood
would gather and over a bowl of
punch or a bottle of wine, the expense of
which they clubbed to share, would spend
their evenings. Into this life Washington65
eagerly entered. As a mere lad his ledger
records expenditures:



"By a club in Arrack at Mr. Gordon's 2/6;

Club of a bottle of Rhenish at Mitchel's
1/3;

To part of the club at Port Royal 1/;

To cash in part for a bowl of fruit punch
1/7-1/2."

When Governor Dinwiddie sent Washington
in 1753 with a letter to M. de St.
Pierre, the French commander, to remonstrate
against the erection of French forts,
one of the incidents of his journey was a
complimentary visit to the Indian queen,
Aliquippa, who resided at the confluence of
the Monongahela and Youghiogany rivers,
in the southeastern part of Alleghany county,
Pennsylvania. She had complained of
his neglect in not calling upon her when on
his outward journey. Young Washington
explained the circumstances that prevented
him, and with an apology he gave her a
coat and a bottle of rum. The latter, Washington
wrote, "was thought the much better
present of the two," and harmony of feeling
was restored. Aliquippa, who was a woman66
of great energy and had performed some
brave deeds, was held in deep respect,
amounting almost to reverence, by the Indians
in western Pennsylvania.

In 1766 Washington shipped an unruly
negro to the West Indies and wrote the captain
of the vessel as follows:

"With this letter comes a negro (Tom)
which I beg the favor of you to sell in any of
the islands you may go to, for whatever he
will fetch, and bring me in return for him



One hhd of best molasses

One ditto of best rum

One barrel of lymes, if good and cheap

One pot of tamarinds, containing about 10 lbs.

Two small ditto of mixed sweetmeats, about 5 lbs each.

And the residue, much or little in good old spirits."

Shortly before this time Washington was
a candidate for the legislature. There was
then a Virginia statute forbidding treating
the voters, or bribery at elections, and declaring
illegal all elections thus obtained, yet
the following is the bill of the liquors Washington67
furnished the voters of Frederick:



  
    40 gallons of Rum punch a 3/6 per galn.
    7.00
  
    15 gallons of wine a 10 per galn.
    7.10
  
    Dinner for your friends
    3.00
  
    13 1/2 gallons of wine a 10/
    6.15
  
    13 gallons of beer a 1/3
    4-4/2
  
    8 qts Cider Royal a 1/6
          .16-3
  
    Punch
          3-9
  
    30 galls strong beer a 8d. per gall.
          1-0
  
    26 gall. best Barbadoes rum 5/
    6.10
  
    12 lbs. S Fefd. Sugar 1/6
    .18-9
  
    3 galls       3 qts of beer 1/per gall.
          3-9
  
    10 bowls of punch 2/6 each
    1.50
  
    9 half pints of rum 7½ d. each
    5-7-1
  
    1 pint of wine
    1-6


After the election was over, Washington
wrote Wood that "I hope no exception was
taken to any that voted against me, but that
all were alike treated, and all had enough.
My only fear is that you spent with too sparing
a hand." It is hardly necessary to say
that such methods reversed the former election:
Washington secured three hundred
and ten votes, and Swearington received
forty-five. From this time until he took
command of the army Washington was a
burgess. Once again he was elected from68
Frederick county, and then, in 1765, he
stood for Fairfax, in which Mount Vernon
was located. Here he received 208 votes,
his colleague getting 148, and in the election
of 1768 he received 185, and his colleague
only 142. Washington spent between
£40 and £75 at each of these elections, and
usually gave a ball to the voters on the
night he was chosen. Some of the miscellaneous
election expenses noted in his ledger
are:

54 galls of strong beer
52 dro. of Ale
£1.0.0. to Mr. John Muir for his fiddler,
For cakes at the election £7.11.1.

Bushrod Washington, made a real estate
investment that did not suit his uncle, and
Washington wrote him as follows:

"Now let me ask you what your views
were in purchasing a Lott in a place which,
I presume, originated with and will end in
two or three Gin shops, which probably will
exist no longer than they serve to ruin the
proprietors, and those who make the most
frequent applications to them."

He expressed an adverse opinion of the
liquor business at one time, somewhat in the69
same line, in a contract he made with a
plantation overseer:

"And whereas, there are a number of
whiskey stills very contiguous to the said
Plantations, and many idle, drunken and dissolute
people continually resorting to the
same, priding themselves in debauching sober
and well-inclined persons, the said Edd
Violet doth promise as well for his own sake
as his employers to avoid them as he ought."

To the contrary, in hiring a gardener it
was agreed as part of the compensation that
the man should have "four dollars at Christmas
with which he may be drunk for four
days and nights; two dollars at Easter to effect
the same purpose; two dollars at Whitsuntide
to be drunk for two days; a dram in
the morning, and a drink of grog at dinner
at noon."

At Valley Forge he complained to Congress
of the mortifications they (even the
general officers) must suffer, when they cannot
invite a French officer, a visiting friend,
or a traveling acquaintance, to a better repast
than stinking whiskey (and not always
that) and a bit of beef without vegetables.

70
In the New York State Library at Albany
is a statement in Washington's handwriting
of his household expenses for three months
at the beginning of his first term as President,
from May 24 to August 24, 1789; the
total expense for that time was £741 and 9
shillings, of which the following items were
for liquor:

In the same library is a memorandum of
Washington's opinion of his general officers,
prepared in the winter of 1791-2. From
this it seems that he considered the drinking
habit of his subordinates, even at that time,
in appointing a successor to General Arthur71
St. Clair, who had just then been defeated
by the Indians:

"Majr General (By Brevet) Wayne.

"More active and enterprising than judicious
no economist it is feared       open to
flattery       vain       easily imposed upon and
liable to be drawn into scrapes. Too indulgent
[the effect perhaps of some of the
causes just mentioned] to his officers and
men. Whether sober       or a little addicted
to the bottle, I know not.

"Majr General (By Brevet) Weedon.

"Not supposed to be an officer of much resource,
though not deficient of a competent
share of understanding       rather addicted to
ease and pleasure, and no enemy it is said to
the bottle       never has had his name brot
forward on this account.

"Major General (By Brevet) Hand.

"A sensible and judicious man, his integrity
unimpeached, and was esteemed a pretty
good officer. But if I recollect rightly
not a very active one. He has never been
charged with intemperance to my knowledge.
His name has rarely been mentioned72
under the present difficulty of choosing an
officer to command, but this may, in a great
measure be owing to his being at a distance.

"Majr General (By Brevet) Scott.

"Brave and means well; but is an officer
of inadequate abilities for extreme command,
and by report is addicted to drinking."

In 1795, when the United States passed an
excise law, distilling became particularly
profitable, and a still was set up on his plantation.
In this whiskey was made from
"rye" chiefly, and Indian corn in a certain
proportion, and this not merely used much
of the estate's product of those two grains,
but quantities were purchased from elsewhere.
In 1798 the profit from the distillery
was three hundred and forty-four pounds,
twelve shillings, and seven and three-quarter
pence, with a stock carried over of seven
hundred and fifty-five and one-quarter gallons;
but this was the most successful year.
Cider, too, was made in large quantities.

Washington resigned his command December
23, 1783, and went back to his estate,
which had suffered from his eight years' absence.
To his friends he offered unpretentious73
hospitality. "My manner of living is
plain," he said, "a glass of wine and a bit of
mutton are always ready and such as will be
content to partake of them are always welcome."

At Washington's official dinners ordinarily
a boiled leg of mutton was served, followed
by a glass of wine. The silver service
was massive, being valued at $30,000, but
the menu was very simple. On a great occasion
it included soup, fish roasted and
boiled, meats, fowls, and so on, and for dessert,
apple pies, puddings, ice cream, jelly,
and fruit. After the cloth had been removed
the President filled his glass and
drank the health by name of each one present.

Samuel Stearns, who was a frequent visitor
to Mount Vernon, thus described the
habits of Washington:

"He is very regular, temperate and industrious;
rises in winter and summer at the
dawn of day; generally reads or writes some
time before breakfast; breakfasts about
seven o'clock on three small Indian hoe
cakes, and as many dishes of tea, and often74
rides immediately to his different farms, and
remains with his laborers until a little after
two o'clock, then returns and dresses. At
three he dines, commonly on a single dish,
and drinks from half a pint to a pint of
Madeira wine. This with one small glass
of punch, a draught of beer, and two dishes
of tea (which he takes half an hour before
the setting of the sun) constitutes his whole
sustenance until the next day. But his table
is always furnished with elegance and exuberance;
and whether he has company or
not, he remains at the table an hour in familiar
conversation, then every one is called
upon to give some absent friend a toast.
After he has dined, he applies himself to
business, and about nine retires to rest; but
when he has company he attends politely
upon them till they wish to withdraw."

Relation of Other Prominent Americans to
the Liquor Traffic

Among the early prominent American
characters the total abstainer was a rare article,
and the prohibitionist almost unknown.
Governor John Winthrop was probably a75
total abstainer, and the romantic character
of John Smith seems quite clear from the
drinking habits of the period. "Never was
warrior known," says an old writer, "from
debts and dice and oaths so free," and his
own words as to the object of life show a
loftiness of purpose almost unknown among
his contemporaries, and should be preserved
for the example they furnish to posterity.
"Seeing we are not born for ourselves but
each to help the other, and our abilities are
much alike at the hour of our birth and the
minute of our death; seeing our good deeds
and our bad by faith in Christ's merits is all
we have to carry our souls to heaven or hell;
seeing honor is our lives' ambition and our
ambition after death to have an honorable
memory of our life; and seeing by no means
we would be abated of the dignities and
glories of our predecessors let us imitate
their virtues so as to be worthily their successors."
So wrote the man of whom old
Thomas Fuller said, "He had a prince's
heart in a beggar's purse," and to whom one
of his comrades, a survivor of the starving
time, paid this touching tribute: "Thus we76
lost him that in all our proceedings made
justice his first guide       ever hating baseness,
sloth, pride and indignity more than any
dangers; that never allowed himself more
than his soldiers with him; that upon no occasion
would he send them where he would
not go himself; that would never see us want
what he either had or could by any means
get us; that would rather want than borrow
or starve than not pay; that loved actions
more than words and hated falsehood and
covetousness worse than death; whose adventures
were our lives and whose loss our
deaths."

But these are two of the few oases in the
dreary desert of early American drunkenness.
Most prominent men of the time
drank to excess. The early colonial grandees
furnish a number of quaint pictures.
Governor William Cosby, of New York,
was admitted to the Humdrum Club on January
24, 1733, over many bowls of punch
made from peculiar and valuable receipts,
known only to the members of the club,
which was potent in its effects even over a
well seasoned veteran like the late Governor77
of Minorca. Sir Danvers Osborne, another
governor, committed suicide. The colony
of New York had been treated to a variety
of rulers since the English had taken possession
of the Dutch colony. They were endowed
with every vice known. They were
fortunately spared the dominion of a madman
who succeeded a dipsomaniac in the
chief office of the province. Governor
Clinton immured himself in the fort and
spent his time with his bottle and a little
trifling circle who lived on his bounty. Governor
Hunter was a man of violent passion.
After he had had one of his fits an Indian
said to an officer, "The governor is drunk."
"No," said the officer, "he never drinks any
strong liquor." The brave replied, "I do
not mean he is drunk with rum, he was born
drunk."

In 1688, in the midst of the rejoicings, the
news came that the Queen, the second wife
of James, had been blessed with a son, who
became heir to the throne. The event was
celebrated the same evening by bonfires in
the streets and a feast at the city hall. At
the latter, Mayor Van Courtlandt became78
so hilarious, that he made a burnt sacrifice
to his loyalty of his hat and periwig, waving
the burning victims over the banquet table
on the point of his straight sword. And
when, in March, 1691, Governor Sloughter
arrived, and Leisler sent him a letter loyally
tendering to him the fort and province, that
functionary, under the influence of the aristocratic
leaders, answered it by sending an
officer to arrest the "usurper" and Milborne
and six of the "inferior insurgents" on
a charge of high treason. They were taken
to prison, and when they were arraigned,
the two principal offenders, denying the authority
of the court, refused to plead, and
appealed to the King. They were condemned
and sentenced to death, but Sloughter,
who in his sober moments was just and
honest, refused to sign the death warrant
until he should hear from the King. The
implacable enemies of the "usurper," determined
on causing his destruction, invited the
governor to a dinner party on Staten Island
on a bright day in May. One of them carried
to the banquet a legally drawn death
warrant, and when the governor had been79
made stupid with liquor, he was induced to
sign the fatal paper. It was sent to the city
that evening, and on the following morning
Leisler and Milborne were summoned to
prepare for execution. Leisler sent for his
wife, Alice, and their older children, and
after a sorrowful parting with them, he and
his son-in-law were led to the gallows in a
drenching rain. They confessed their errors
of judgment but denied all intentional
wrongdoing. The blamelessness of their
lives confirmed their declarations of innocence.
Before Sloughter was permitted to
recover from his debauch, they were hanged.
It was foul murder. The governor was tortured
with remorse for his act, and died of
delirium tremens three months afterward.

When William Penn, in 1682, drew up
his code of laws for Pennsylvania he made
the drinking of healths and the selling of
liquor to Indians crimes. His opinion as to
drinking healths must have changed between
1682 and 1710 when Dean Swift met Penn
and passed a lively evening. He writes
Stella, "We sat two hours drinking as good
wine as you do," and it is the strongest proof80
of Penn's lovableness that after drinking
good wine with him for two hours that
night, Swift the next morning has no word
of dispraise for his companion.

One of the oddest characters in early Virginia
history was Dr. John Pott, who was at
one time governor of Virginia, and is described
as a Master of Arts, well practiced
in chirurgery and physic and expert also in
distilling waters, besides many other ingenious
devices. It seems he was also very fond
of tasting distilled waters, and at times was
more of a boon companion than quite comported
with his dignity, especially after he
had come to be governor. A letter of George
Sandys says of Dr. Pott: "At first he kept
too much company with his inferiors who
hung upon him while his good liquor lasted."
After Harvey's arrival Ex-Governor
Pott was held to answer two charges. One
was for having abused the power entrusted
to him by pardoning a culprit who had been
convicted of wilful murder, the other was
for stealing cattle. The first charge was a
common notoriety; on the second Doctor
Pott was tried by a jury and found guilty.81
The ex-governor was not a pardoner of felony
but was a felon himself. The affair
reads like a scene in comic opera. Some reluctance
was felt about inflicting vulgar punishment
upon an educated man of good social
position, so he was not sent to jail but
confined in his own house, while Sir John
Harvey wrote to the King for instructions in
the matter. He informed the King that
Doctor Pott was by far the best physician in
the colony and indeed the only one skilled in
epidemics and recommended that he should
be pardoned. Accordingly the doctor was
set free and forthwith resumed his practice.

No one was better disposed toward a moderate
conviviality than Franklin himself.
In that old house on High street where he
lived and died there remains now in the possession
of the Pennsylvania Historical Society
that delightful punch-keg which rolled
so easily from guest to guest, and which carried
the generous liquor generously around
Franklin's board. A curious little keg this,
pretty, portly, and altogether unlike other
punch-bowls left us from colonial days.
Among the china was a fine large jug for82
beer, to stand in the cooler. Franklin's wife
was frugal, and it pleased him to set aside
her customary frugality on the blithesome
occasions when the punch-keg went rolling
round.

In 1768, when the advent of the new governor
made necessary the election of a new
House of Burgesses, Jefferson already
craved the opportunity to take an active
part in affairs, and at once offered himself
as a candidate for Albemarle county.
He kept open house, distributed limitless
punch, stood by the polls politely
bowing to every voter who named him
according to the Virginia fashion of the
day, and had the good fortune, by these meritorious
efforts, to win success. In 1794 Jefferson
very nearly sympathized with the
Whiskey Rebellion. He called the excise
law an infernal one. In his gloomy views
of the War of 1812 he asks what Virginia
can raise, and answers his question thus:
"Tobacco? It is not worth the pipe it is
smoked in. Some say whiskey, but all mankind
must become drunkards to consume it."
While Chastellux, in his travels, tells of discussing
a bowl of punch with Jefferson at83
Monticello, Jefferson never seems to have
drunk ardent spirits or strong wine, and in
his last illness his physician could not induce
him to take brandy strong enough to
benefit him.

While Hamilton favored the whiskey tax
and caused the Whiskey Rebellion thereby,
he nevertheless was in favor of temperance,
as is shown by the circulars he issued to the
army.

In his early youth Andrew Jackson was
gay, careless, rollicking, fond of drinking,
horse-racing, cock-fighting, and all kinds of
mischief; his habits moderated in later years
and in his old age Jackson became religious.

The son of Dolly Madison by her first
marriage, Payne Todd, was a continual
financial burden to her even after the death
of President Madison, and by his dissipation
broke his mother's heart, embittered her old
age, and ruined her financially as if to show
that even the wife of the President was not
exempt from the burdens of any mother of a
drunkard. When Tyler became President
he lived precisely as he had done on his Virginia
plantation. He invariably invited visitors
to visit the family dining-room, and84
"take something," from a sideboard well
garnished with decanters of ardent spirits
and wine, with a bowl of juleps in the summer,
and of eggnog in the winter.

One of the most picturesque figures of
this period was General Sam Houston, who
was a prominent figure at Washington during
the Taylor administration. Because of
trouble with his wife he resigned the governorship
of Tennessee, went into the Cherokee
country, adopted the Indian costume
and became an Indian trader and so dissipated
that his Indian name was "Big-drunk."
He wore a waistcoat made from
the skin of a panther dressed with the hair
on, and was conspicuous in the Senate for
whittling soft pine sticks, which were provided
him by the seargeant-at-arms. He
was the best customer supplied from his own
whiskey barrel, until one day after a prolonged
debauch he heard that the Mexicans
had taken up arms against their revolted
province. He cast off his Indian attire,
dressed like a white man, and never touched
a drop of any intoxicating beverage afterwards.

CHAPTER VII

The Slave Trade

In no branch of history is the culpability
of the liquor traffic more thoroughly shown
than in its relation to the slave trade. The
making of rum aided and almost supported
the slave trade in this country. The poor
negroes were bought on the coast of Africa
by New England sea captains and paid for
with barrels of New England rum. These
slaves were then carried on slave ships to the
West Indies and sold at a large profit to
planters and slave dealers for a cargo of
molasses. This was brought to New England,
distilled into rum, and sent off to Africa;
thus the circle of molasses, slaves, and
rum was completed.

In 1708 the West Indies afforded the
great demand for negroes; they also furnished
the raw material supplying the manufacture
of the main merchandise which the86
thirsty Gold Coast drank up in barter for
its poor, banished children. Governor Hopkins
stated that for more than thirty years
prior to 1764 Rhode Island sent to the Coast
annually eighteen vessels carrying 1,800
hogsheads of rum. It displaced French
brandies in the trade of the Coast after 1723.
The commerce in rum and slaves afforded
about £40,000 per annum for remittance
from Rhode Island to Great Britain. Molasses
and poor sugar, distilled in Boston
and more especially in Newport into rum,
made the staple export to Africa. Some obtained
gallon for gallon of molasses, but the
average was 96 to 100. Newport had twenty-two
still houses. Boston had the best example,
owned by a Mr. Childs. The cost of
distilling was five and a half pence per gallon.
Cisterns and vats cost fourteen to sixteen
shillings per one hundred gallons, in
1735, not including lumber. The quantity
of rum distilled was enormous, and in 1750
it was estimated that Massachusetts alone
consumed more than 15,000 hogsheads of
molasses for this purpose. The average
price of molasses in the West Indies was87
thirteen or fourteen pence per gallon. The
consumption of rum in the fisheries and
lumbering and ship-building districts was
large.

There was no article of merchandise comparable
to rum on the African coast. Our
forefathers' instincts were neither moral nor
immoral; they were simply economic. They
had tried dry-goods, and Africa rejected
them in favor of the wet. Captain George
Scott writes lamenting the purchasing of
dry-goods and says, "had we laid out two
thousand pounds in rum, bread and flour, it
would purchase more in value than all our
dry-goods."

The cargo of the Caesar, out-bound, was:
eighty-two barrels, six hogsheads and six
tierces of New England rum; thirty-three
barrels of best Jamaica spirits; thirty-three
barrels of Barbadoes rum; twenty-five pairs
of pistols; two casks of musket-balls; one
chest of hand arms; twenty-five cutlasses.
The return cargo was: in the hold on board
the scow Caesar, one hundred and fifty-three
adult slaves, and two children.

The ships were light of draught and built88
for speed. The captain and the crew were
men little troubled with scruples touching
the work they had to do. Once off the
coast of Mozambique or Guinea, the cargo
was rapidly made up. If a band of
blacks, moved by curiosity, came round
the vessel in a skiff, they were sure to be
lured on board, ironed, and hurried into
the hold. If a boat's crew went on shore,
they came back dragging some wretched
man between them. For rum the native
princes gladly sold prisoners that their subjects
made in war. When every available
inch of space had been filled, the slaver
turned westward and made for some southern
port. The coast line had scarcely disappeared
from view when the hatches were
taken off and the terrors of the voyage
began. Every fine day at sunrise the slaves
were driven on deck. Such as were noisy
had the thumb-screws put on. Such as
were hard to manage were chained in
pairs by the arms, or the ankles, or the
necks. At the first sign of insurrection the
leaders were shot down and cast into the sea.
Their food was salt pork and beans. Their89
sole exercise was dancing and capering
about the deck. This they were made to do.
If any refused the cat-o'-nine-tails or the
rope's end was vigorously applied. When
the sun set the whole band went below. The
transactions of one of these slavers are preserved
in the history of New Bedford and
make interesting reading for those who
would hold up the Puritan as innocent of
the transgression which stains the character
of the Cavalier.

The Southern Planter

Liquor and slavery combined produced
the Southern planter, whose life has often90
been described by various writers. When
Yeardley assumed control of affairs in Virginia,
the Company required that there
should be inserted in all formal grants of
land a covenant that the patentees should
not apply themselves either wholly or principally
to the culture of tobacco, but should
divide their attentions among a number of
commodities carefully specified in each deed.
These consisted of Indian corn, wheat, flax,
silk-grass, and wine. Parton, in his Life of
Jefferson, says that the Virginia planter expended
the proceeds of his tobacco in vast
ugly mansions, heavy furniture, costly apparel,
Madeira wines, fine horses, and
slaves.

Another writer says:

"The gentleman of fortune rises about
nine o'clock. He may perhaps make an excursion
to his stables to see his horses, which
is seldom more than fifty yards from his
house; he returns to breakfast between nine
and ten, which is generally tea or coffee,
bread and butter and very thin slices of venison,
ham, or hung beef. He then lies down91
on a pallet on the floor in the coolest room in
the house in his shirt and trousers only, with
a negro at his head and another at his feet to
fan him and keep off the flies; between
twelve and one he takes a bombo or toddy, a
liquor compounded of water, sugar, rum,
and nutmeg, which is made weak and kept
cool; he dines between two and three, and at
every meal, whatever else there may be, a
ham and greens or cabbage is always a
standing dish. At dinner he drinks cider,
toddy, punch, port, claret, and Madeira,
which is generally excellent here; having
drank some few glasses of wine after dinner
he returns to his pallet, with his two blacks
to fan him, and continues to drink toddy or
sangaree all the afternoon. Between nine
and ten in the evening he eats a light supper
of milk, fruit, etc., and almost invariably retires
to bed for the night. This is his general
way of living in his family when he has
no company. No doubt many differ from
it, some in one respect and some in another,
but more follow it than do not. Pewter cups
and mugs were everywhere to be seen and92
now and then a drinking horn. There were
in the house for the purposes of drinking a
variety of receptacles, such as the tumbler,
the mug, the cup, the flagon, the tankard,
and the beaker. The cups were known by a
number of names, such as the lignum vitæ,
the syllabub, the sack, and the dram. Many
planters in moderate circumstances were in
possession of a quantity of silver plate."

MacMasters says of the Southern planter:
"Numerous slaves and white servants attended
them in every capacity that use or ostentation
could suggest. On their tables were
to be found the luxuries of the Old World
and the New, and chief among these stood
Madeira and rum. That the men of that
generation drank more deeply than the men
of this is not to be doubted." Another writer
says: "The Maryland gentry ordered champagne
from Europe by the cask and Madeira
by the pipe and dressed in the latest
fashion."

Betting and gambling were with drunkenness
and a passion for duelling and running
in debt the chief sins of the South Carolina
gentleman.

The Indian Tribes

When Gladwyn wrote to Amherst, "If
your Excellency still intends to punish the
Indians farther for their barbarities it may
easily be done without any expense to the
crown by permitting a free sale of rum
which will destroy them more effectually
than fire and sword," he indicated the policy
toward the Indian tribes which has been
steadily pursued by all civilized nations on
the American continent except the French.
Irving, in his Knickerbocker's History of
New York, has stated the truth on this, as he
often does on other matters: "Our benevolent
forefathers endeavored as much as possible
to ameliorate their situation by giving
them gin, wine and glass beads in exchange
for their peltries, for it seemed the kind-hearted
Dutchmen had conceived a great
friendship for their savage neighbors; on
account of their being pleasant men to trade
with, and little skilled in the art of making
a bargain." There is extant a letter
of Ebenezer Hazard to Silas Deane of date
February 25, 1775, in which Hazard says:
"I am told the Committee appointed by the94
House to state the grievances of this Colony,
though mostly Tories, have included all
those complained of by Congress and mentioned
some new ones, particularly the destruction
of the Indian Trade by the Quebec
Duty Act. You know that trade cannot be
carried on without rum. By the Quebec
Duty Act no rum may be sold in the Province
but what is entered and the duty paid at
Quebec or on Lake Champlain. The Virginians,
etc., cannot afford to carry their rum
to these places to be entered, and consequently
can have no trade. This I am very credibly
informed is one of the grievances they
have enumerated."

There were but few storekeepers in Virginia
in early days who were not engaged in
the Indian trade. Guns, ammunition, rum,
blankets, knives, and hatchets were the articles
in greatest demand among the tribes.
When in the ordinary course of events a
young American in Virginia or elsewhere
felt himself impelled to leave the paternal
roof he put aside his gun and fishing rod, and
asked of his father some money, a slave, and
a canoe. His brow grew thoughtful, and he95
adopted a pipe. With his money he purchased
beads, trinkets, blankets, guns, powder,
not forgetting for various reasons a supply
of rum. With these he purposed laying
the foundation of his fortunes as an Indian
trader. If the trader had several servants
with him or was associated with other traders
he would fix his quarters in some large
Indian town and send his subordinates to the
surrounding villages, with a suitable supply
of blankets, guns, hatchets, liquor, tobacco,
etc. This wild traffic was liable to every
species of disorder, a fruitful source of
broils, robberies, and murders. The fur
traders were a class of men held in contempt
among the Iroquois and known among them
by the significant title of Rum Carriers. The
white trappers seem to have been as dissipated
as the Indians. One writer declares
that most of the Canadians drink so much
brandy in the morning that they are unfit for
work all day. Another says that when a
canoe man is tired he will lift a keg of
brandy to his lips and drink the raw liquor
from the bung-hole, after which, having
spoiled his appetite, he goes to bed supperless,96
so with drink and hardship he is an old
man at forty. The type of French trapper
left in the old Northwest may still be seen
far north in the great fur land; he is idle,
devoted to singing, dancing, gossip, and
drinking to intoxication; having vanity as
his besetting sin. The Jesuits denounced the
traffic. Their case was a strong one, but so
was the case of their opponents. There was
a real and imminent danger that the thirsty
savages, if refused brandy by the French,
would seek it from the Dutch and English
of New York. It was the most potent lure
and the most killing bait. Wherever it was
found, there the Indians and their beaver
skins were sure to go, and the interests of the
fur trade, vital to the colony, were bound to
go with it. Cadillac was especially incensed
against the Jesuits on account of their opposition
to the sale of spirits. So strong was
their hostility that Louis XIV, in 1694, referred
to the Sorbonne for decision the
question of allowing French brandy to be
shipped to Michilimackinac. The decision
of the Council gave to the Northwest its first
prohibitory law; and the commandant was97
not more willing to enforce the order than
his successors have been to carry out similar
laws. "A drink of brandy after the repast,"
he maintained, "seems necessary to cook the
bilious meats and the crudities which they
leave in the stomach." Again, at Detroit,
Cadillac quotes from a sermon by Father
Carhail, whose wing he was engaged in
plucking. The Jesuit had maintained that
there was "no power, either human or divine,
which can permit the sale of this
drink." Hence, you perceive, argues the
crafty commandant, "that this Father passes
boldly on all matters of state, and will not
even submit to the decision of the pope."
The question was indeed a hard one for
Cadillac. He understood clearly that unless
he had liquor to sell to the savages he might
as well abandon his post; for the Indians
would go straight to the English at Albany
where goods were cheap and rum was unlimited.
To give up Detroit never entered
Cadillac's plan. He therefore chose the
middle course. Instead of prohibition he
would have high license. In the restrictions
which he threw about the traffic in liquors98
he was both honest and earnest; and, as
events proved, he was far in advance of his
times. In the report of M. d'Aigrement,
who inspected Detroit in 1708, it is mentioned
as one of the grievances of the savages
against Cadillac that "in order to prevent
disturbances which would arise from
the excessive use of brandy, he caused it all
to be put into the store-house and sold it at
the rate of twenty francs a quart. Those
who will have brandy, French as well as Indians,
are obliged to go to the store-house to
drink, and each can obtain at one time only
the twenty-fourth part of a quart. It is certain
that the savages cannot become intoxicated
on that quantity. The price is high,
and as they cannot get brandy only each in
his turn, it sometimes happens that the savages
are obliged to return home without a
taste of this beverage, and they seem ready
to kill themselves with disappointment.
Though the Jesuits refused absolution to all
who sold brandy to the Indians, they sold it
themselves. LaSalle had detected them
in it." Count Frontenac declares that "The
Jesuits greatly exaggerate the disorders99
caused by brandy and they easily convince
persons who do not know the interested motives
which have led them to harp continually
on this string for more than forty
years.... They have long wished to have
the fur trade entirely to themselves." Appeal
was made to the King, who with his
Jesuit confessor, guardian of his conscience,
on the one side, and Colbert, guardian of his
worldly interests, on the other, stood in some
perplexity. The case was referred to the
fathers of the Sorbonne and they pronounced
the selling of brandy to the Indians
a mortal sin. It was next referred to the
chief merchants and inhabitants of Canada.
Each was directed to write his views. The
great majority were for unrestricted trade in
brandy, a few for limited and guarded trade,
and two or three declared for prohibition.
Decrees of prohibition were passed from
time to time, but they were unavailing. The
King was never at heart a prohibitionist.
His Canadian revenue was drawn from the
fur trade, and the singular argument of the
partisans of brandy, that its attractions were
needed to keep the Indians from contact100
with heresy, served admirably to salve his
conscience. The Dutch and English being
the heretics, he distrusted the Bishop of
Quebec, the great champion of the anti-liquor
movement. He wrote to Saint Vallier,
Laval's successor in the bishopric,
that the brandy trade was very useful to
the kingdom of France, that it should be
regulated, not prevented, that consciences
must not be disturbed by denunciations of it
as a sin, that the zeal of the ecclesiastics
might be affected by personal interests and
passions.

From the time, in 1620, when Samoset and
Tisquantum brought Massasoit to Plymouth
to drink strong waters with the Puritans,
liquor played a steady part in all negotiations
between the white men and the red
men. When Hamor went to visit Powhattan
he was received with royal courtesy, "bread
was brought in in two great wooden bowls,
the quantity of a bushel of sod bread, made
up round, of the bygnesse of a tenise-ball,
whereof we ate some few." After this repast
Hamor and his comrades were regaled
with "a great glasse of sacke" and then ushered101
into the wigwam for the night. From
this time on at all Indian negotiations a
large percentage of the Indians expected
rum or whiskey to be produced.

No other cause has been as prolific of Indian
wars as the liquor traffic.

The war of the Indians with the Dutch in
1675 in New York was caused by the sale of
liquor and firearms to the Indians, as well as
all the trouble that the Dutch ever seem to
have had with their Indian neighbors.

Liquor entered largely as a consideration
into the purchase of land from the Indians,
and the dispute over title and inadequate
amounts frequently caused trouble.

In 1675 Robert Livingston purchased a
tract of land on the east side of Hudson
river, near Catskill, which was paid for in
guilders, blankets, shirts, cloth, tin kettles,
powder, guns, twenty little looking-glasses,
fish hooks, awls, nails, tobacco, knives, strong
beer, four stroud coats, two duffel coats, four
tin kettles, rum and pipes, ten pairs large
stockings, ten pairs small stockings, adzes,
paint, bottles, and scissors. The treaty with
the Creek Indians was signed on October102
21, 1733, when the governor distributed the
following presents among the Indians: A
laced coat and a laced hat and shirt to each
of the chiefs; to each of the warriors, a gun
and a mantle of duffils (a coarse woolen
cloth with nap and fringe), and to all their
attendants coarse cloth for clothing; a barrel
of gunpowder; four kegs of bullets; a piece
of broadcloth; a piece of Irish linen; a cask
of tobacco pipes; eight belts and cutlasses
with gilt handles; tape, and of all colors;
eight kegs of rum to be carried home to their
towns; one pound of powder, one pound of
bullets, and as much provision for each one
as they pleased to take for their journey
home.

In the spring of 1795 the directors of the
Connecticut Land Company sent out surveyors
through the Mohawk, over the portage
of Wood creek, Oneida lake, and the Oswego
river to Lake Ontario. At Buffalo the
agent bought of the Indians their remaining
claim to the lands east of the Cuyahoga river
for five hundred pounds, New York currency,
two beef cattle, and one hundred gallons
of whiskey.

103
The murder in 1774 without provocation
of the family of Logan, a friendly chief of
the Cayuga nation and of great influence,
Jefferson shows was due to the drunkenness
of two traders, Greathouse and Tomlinson,
and caused Logan to deliver the
speech which is often given in school readers.
The Seminole War had the combined
causes of slavery and liquor. President
Jackson gave slave traders permission to buy
slaves of the Seminole Indians. The trader,
knowing that the Indians were intoxicated,
would induce them to give bills of sale for
negroes they did not own, and the complications
thus caused led to the Seminole War.

The Black Hawk War was directly caused
by the liquor traffic, while the career of Pontiac,
the ablest Indian statesman his race
ever produced, illustrates that drunkenness
was the bane of the Indian race. In the
same speech in which Pontiac said, "our
people love liquor and if we dwelt near your
old village of Detroit, our warriors would be
always drunk," he concluded his harangue
with the desire that the rum barrel might be
opened and his warriors allowed to quench104
their thirst. His life was ended by an English
trader named Williamson, who bribed
a strolling Indian of the Kaskia tribe by a
barrel of rum to murder him, and for that
reward the savage stole softly behind Pontiac
while he was meditating in the forest
and buried his hatchet in his brain.

Of the influence of the white man on the
Indians the less said the better. They eradicated
none of his vices and they lent him
many of their own. They found him abstinent,
and they made him a guzzler of fire
water. They found him hospitable, and
they made him suspicious and vindictive.
They found him in freedom, the owner of a
great country: they robbed him of the one,
and crowded him out of the other. The
Dutch were too much beer drinkers, became
with speed rum consumers, and opposed
prohibiting the sale of rum to the Indians.
William Penn wrote in 1683: "Ye Dutch,
Sweed and English have by brandy and
specially rum almost debauched ye Indians
all." On arriving at a trading post an Indian
hunting party would trade perhaps a third
of their peltries for fine clothes, ammunition,105
paint, tobacco, and like articles. Then a keg
of brandy would be purchased and the council
held to decide who was to get drunk and
who was to stay sober. All arms and clubs
were taken away and hidden and the orgie
would begin, all the Indians in the neighborhood
being called in. It was the task of those
who kept sober to prevent the drunken ones
from killing one another, a task always hazardous
and frequently unsuccessful, sometimes
as many as five being killed in one
night. When the keg was empty brandy was
brought by the kettle full and ladled out
with large wooden spoons, and this was kept
up until the last skin was disposed of. Then,
dejected, wounded, lamed, with their fine
new shirts torn, their blankets burned, and
nothing but the ammunition and tobacco
saved, they would start off down the river to
hunt, and begin again the same round of alternating
toil and drudgery. Nevertheless,
with all their rage for brandy they sometimes
showed a self control quite admirable
in its way. When at a fair, a council, or a
friendly visit their entertainers regaled them
with rations of the coveted liquor, so prudently106
measured out that they could not be
the worse for it, they would unite their several
portions in a common stock, which they
would then divide among a few of their
number, thus enabling them to attain that
complete intoxication which, in their view,
was the true end of all drinking. The objects
of this benevolence were expected to
requite it on a similar future occasion. In
1708, of the sixty-three settlers at Detroit,
thirty-four were traders, and the only profitable
articles of trade were ammunition and
brandy, the English being able to undersell
the French in all other commodities. At
the time of the sales of furs every house in
Montreal was a drinking shop. In a letter
of Governor Halderman to Captain Lernoult,
dated July 23, 1729, Halderman says:
"I observe with great concern the astonishing
consumption of rum at Detroit, amounting
to seventeen thousand five hundred and
twenty gallons a year."

In his notes on Virginia, Jefferson states
that the census of 1669 showed that the Indians
of Virginia in sixty-two years decreased
about one-third, which decrease Jefferson107
attributes to spirituous liquors and
the smallpox. When president, Jefferson
recommended that the sale among the Indian
tribes of intoxicating liquors be prohibited.

Of the traffic and its effect on the Indians
a large amount of practically unanimous evidence
can be produced. LeClercq observes
with truth and candor that an Indian would
be baptized ten times a day for a pint of
brandy or a pound of tobacco. Father
Etienne Carheil says: "Our missions are reduced
to such an extremity that we can no
longer maintain them against the infinity of
disorder, brutality, violence, injustice, impiety,
impurity, insolence, scorn, and insult
which the deplorable and infamous traffic in
brandy has spread universally among the Indians
of these parts. In the despair in which
we are plunged, nothing remains for us but to
abandon them to the brandy sellers as a domain
of drunkenness and debauchery."

On one occasion the French Denonville
lectured Dongon, the English governor, for
allowing West India rum to be sent to the
Long House. "Think you that religion will108
make any progress while your traders supply
the savages in abundance with the
liquor, which as you ought to know converts
them into demons, and their wigwams into
counterparts of hell." One seems to see the
Irishman's tongue curl under his cheek as
he replies: "Methinks our rum does as little
hurt as your brandy, and in the opinion
of Christians is much more wholesome."

Politics and Elections

The presidential campaign of 1840 surpassed
in excitement and intensity of feeling
all which had preceded it. Delegations to
the whig conventions carried banners and
often had a small log cabin mounted on
wheels in which was a barrel of hard cider,
the beverage of the campaign. Early in Harrison's
campaign comments were made on the
elegant style of living in the White House
during Van Buren's administration. Van
Buren was charged with being an aristocrat
and a monarchist while the masses toiled and
suffered to pay for his luxurious living. A
Richmond newspaper observed derisively of109
Harrison, "Give him a barrel of hard cider
and a pension of two thousand dollars and
our word for it he will sit for the remainder
of his days contented in a log cabin." Log
cabins and hard cider thus became the symbols
of a popular crusade. The log cabins
were decked in frontier style with coonskins,
bunches of corn, strings of peppers and
dried apples and the like, and were set up in
cities and villages. Inside these cabins copious
supplies of cider were on tap to be
drunk with gourds. The appropriateness of
the symbol came from the fact that Harrison
had formerly resided in a western log cabin,
and the cider was meant to typify western
hospitality. The result was that young and
old drank the cider freely and the whig
meetings often degenerated into mere
drunken carousals, the example of which
was especially injurious to the rising generation.

There are men still alive who claim that
a single glass of wine drunk by Herschel V.
Johnson was responsible for the wreck of
the democratic party in 1860 by unfitting110
him to reply to the speech of Howell Cobb
in favor of separate democratic nominations
at the Georgia democratic state convention.
The Count de Paris says of the vigilance
committees that terrorized the South into secession:
"The bar-room was generally the
place of their meetings. Around the counter
on which gin and whiskey circulated
freely a few frantic individuals pronounced
judgment upon their fellow citizens, whether
present or absent."

In one of the Lincoln-Douglas joint debates
Douglas described his own father as
an excellent cooper. Lincoln said he did
not doubt the truth of the statement for he
knew of one very good whisky cask he had
made. As Douglas was short and thick-set
and a heavy drinker the joke was enjoyed.

On another occasion, Douglas said that
when he first knew Lincoln, Lincoln was a
good bar-tender. Lincoln in admitting that
he had sold whisky said Douglas was one of
his best customers, adding that he had left
his side of the counter but Douglas had
stuck to the other side.

111

Early Defiance of Law

In the last decade of the eighteenth century
the Whiskey Rebellion arose from the
refusal of the Scotch-Irish whiskey distillers
of Pennsylvania to pay the excise on whiskey.
If a collector came among them he
was attacked, his books and papers taken, his
commission torn up, and a solemn promise
exacted that he would publish his resignation
in the Pittsburgh Gazette. If a farmer
gave information as to where the stills could
be found, his barns were burned. If a distiller
entered his stills as the law required,
he was sure to be visited by a masked mob.
Sometimes his grist-mill was made useless,
sometimes his stills destroyed, or a piece of
his saw-mill carried away, and a command
laid upon him to publish what had been
done to him in the Gazette. One unhappy
man, who had rented his house to a collector,
was visited at the dead of night by a mob
of blackened and disguised men. He was
seized, carried to the woods, shorn of his
hair, tarred, feathered, and bound to a tree.
They next formed associations of those who,112
in the language of the district, were ready to
"forbear" entering their stills. They ended
by working themselves into a fury and calling
a meeting of distillers for the 27th of
July, at Restone, Old Fort, a town on which
the inhabitants have since bestowed the
humbler name of Brownsville. From this
gathering went out a call for two conventions.
One was to meet on the 23d of August
at Washington, in Pennsylvania. The
date chosen for the meeting of the second
was September 7th, and the place Pittsburgh.
Both were held. That at Washington
denounced the law and called on all
good people to treat every man taking office
under it with contempt, and withhold from
him all comfort, aid, and support. That at
Pittsburgh complained bitterly of the salaries
of the federal officers, of the rate of interest
on the national debt, of the Funding
System, of the Bank, and of the tax on whiskey.
Meantime the collector for the counties
of Washington and Alleghany was set
upon. On the day before the Pittsburgh
meeting a party of armed men waylaid him
at a lonely spot on Pigeon creek, stripped,113
tarred, and feathered him, cut off his hair,
and took away his horse. They were disguised,
but he recognized three of the band,
and swore out warrants against them in the
district court at Philadelphia. These were
sent to the marshal; but the marshal was a
prudent man, and gave them to his deputy,
who, early in October, went down into Alleghany
to serve them. He hid his errand,
and as he rode along, beheld such signs of
the angry mood of the people, and heard
such threats, that he came back with the
writs in his pocket unserved. And now he
determined to send them under cover of private
letters, and selected for the bearer a
poor, half-witted cow-driver. The messenger
knew not what he bore; but when the
people found out that he was delivering
writs, he was seized, robbed of his horse and
money, whipped till he could scarcely stand,
tarred, feathered, blindfolded, and tied to a
tree in the woods.

In 1794 a process went out from the district
court at Philadelphia against seventy-five
distillers who had disobeyed the law.
Fifty were in the five counties of Fayette,114
Bedford, Alleghany, Washington, and Westmoreland.
Each writ was dated the 13th of
May, and each was entered in the docket as
issued on the 31st. But the officials were so
tardy that it was July when the marshal rode
west to serve them. He arrived in the hurry
of harvest, when liquor circulated most freely
and drunkenness was most prevalent. Yet
he served his writs without harm till but one
was left. It was drawn against a distiller
named Miller, whose house was fourteen
miles from Pittsburgh, on the road to Washington.
On the morning of July 15th the
marshal set out from Pittsburgh to serve it.
He found Miller in a harvest field surrounded
by a body of reapers. All went well till
he was about to return, when one of them
gave the alarm. While some threw down
their scythes and followed him, others ran
back to the house of the brigade inspector
near by. There the Mingo creek regiment
had gathered to make a select corps of militia
as its quota of the eighty thousand minute
men required by Congress. All had drunk
deeply, and as the messengers came up
shouting "The federal sheriff is taking away115
men to Philadelphia," they flew to arms.
Though it was then night many set off at
once, and gathering strength as they went,
drew up the next morning, thirty-seven
strong, before the house of Revenue Inspector
Neville, near Pittsburgh. At the head
of them was John Holcroft who whitened
half the trees in the four counties with the
effusions of Tom the Tinker. The inspector
demanded what they wished. They answered
evasively. He fired upon them.
They returned the shot, and were instantly
opened on by a band of negroes posted in a
neighboring house. At this the mob scattered,
leaving six wounded and one dead.
Tom the Tinker was a nom-de-guerre which
originated from the house of an obnoxious
official being pulled to pieces by a mob
whose members gave out that they were
"mending it." Mending and tinkering being
interchangeable terms, the members
dubbed themselves "tinkers," and "Tom the
Tinker was shortly evolved as the popular
watchword of the first rebellion against the
United States government."

CHAPTER VIII

Christenings       Marriages       Funerals

In early American history the use of liquor
by an infant seems to have been nearly coincident
with its entrance into life. A family
receipt called Caudle has been handed
down through the family of Mrs. Johannes
de Peyster, and calls for "three gallons of
water, seven pounds of sugar, oatmeal by the
pound, spice, raisins and lemons by the
quart and two gallons of the very best Madeira
wine." This was especially served at
the baptism of a child, and partaken of extensively
by the women. In early times the Puritan
women drank cider and Madeira mixed
with water, and much scandal was given by
the readiness with which the merry wives of
Philadelphia joined in their husbands' comfortable
potations. The eighteenth century
was the drinking era, and our colony followed
in no halting measure the jovial fashions117
of the day. In 1733 the Pennsylvania
Gazette laments that Philadelphia women,
"otherwise discreet," instead of contenting
themselves with one good draught of beer in
the morning take "two or three drams by
which their appetite for wholesome food is
destroyed." Women kept ordinaries and
taverns from early days. Widows abounded,
for the life of the male colonist was hard,
exposure was great, and many died in middle
age. War also had many victims. Tavern-keeping
was the resort of widows of
small means then. Many licenses were
granted to them to keep victualling houses,
to draw wine, and make and sell beer.
In 1684 the wife of one Nicholas Howard
was licensed "to entertain lodgers in the
absence of her husband"; while other
women were permitted to sell food and
drink but could not entertain lodgers because
their husbands were absent from home,
thus drawing nice distinctions. A Salem
dame in 1645 could keep an ordinary if she
provided "a godly man" to manage her business.

Wedding festivities seemed to have caused118
about the same amount of liquor drinking
throughout the country. In the new land
weddings and births were joyful events.
The colonists broke with the home traditions
and insisted on being married at home rather
than at church. As civilization advanced
and habits grew more luxurious the marriage
festivities grew more elaborate and
became affairs of serious expense. Scharf,
in his Chronicles of Baltimore, says the
house would be filled with company to dine;
the same company would stay to supper.
For two days punch was dealt out in profusion.
The gentlemen saw the groom on
the first floor, and then ascended to the second
floor where they saw the bride; there
every gentleman, even to one hundred a day,
kissed her. Weddings in old Philadelphia
were very expensive and harassing to the
wedded. The bride's home was filled with
company to dine, the same guests usually
stayed to tea, while for two days punch was
served in great profusion. Kissing the bride
and drinking punch seem to have been the
leading features of these entertainments.

A custom prevailed in southern Pennsylvania119
of barring the progress of the coach
of the newly married pair by ropes and
other obstacles, which were not removed
until the groom paid toll in the form of a
bottle of wine, or of drinks to his persecutors.

The famous Schuyler wedding cake had,
among other ingredients, twelve dozen eggs,
forty-eight pounds of raisins, twenty-four
pounds of currants, four quarts of brandy,
a quart of rum. This was mixed in a wash
tub.

From the earliest period funerals seem to
have caused more expense and drunkenness
than weddings. In Sewell's Diary of the
date of August 2, 1725, he says of the funeral
of Mrs. Catherine Winthrop: "Had good
birth-cake, good wine, Burgundy and Canary,
good Beer, oranges and pears." The
Puritan funerals were accompanied with so
much drinking that a law had to be passed
to check the extravagance. In Massachusetts
one funeral cost six hundred pounds.
Parker, in his history of Londonderry, says:

"Their funeral observances were of a
character in some respects peculiar. When120
death entered their community and one of
their members was removed, there was at
once a cessation of all labor in the neighborhood.
The people gathered together at the
house of mourning, observed a custom which
they had brought with them from Ireland,
called a 'wake' or watching with the dead,
from night to night until the interment.
These night scenes often exhibited a mixture
of seriousness and of humor which appear
incompatible. The Scriptures would be
read, prayer offered, and words of counsel
and consolation administered; but ere long,
according to established usage, the glass with
its exhilarating beverage, must circulate
freely. Although funeral sermons were seldom
if ever delivered on the occasion, yet
there would be usually as large a congregation
as assembled on the Sabbath. Previous
to the prayer, spirit was handed round, not
only to the mourners and bearers, but to the
whole assembly. Again after prayer, and
before the coffin was removed, the same was
done. Nearly all would follow the body to
the grave, and at their return the comforting
draught was again administered, and ample121
entertainment provided. Many a family became
embarrassed in consequence of the
heavy expenses incurred, not so much by the
sickness which preceded the death of one of
its members, as by the funeral services as
then observed, and which, as they supposed,
respect for the dead required."

In New York state before a burial took
place a number of persons, usually friends
of the dead, watched the body throughout
the night, liberally supplied with various
bodily comforts, such as abundant strong
drink, plentiful tobacco and pipes, and newly-made
cakes. These watchers were not
wholly gloomy nor did the midnight hours
lag unsolaced. A Dutch funeral was costly,
the expenditure for gloves, scarfs, and rings
was augmented in New York by the gift of
a bottle of wine and a linen scarf. At the
funeral of Louis Wingard, in Albany, the
attendance was large, and many friends returned
to the house and made a night of it.
These sober Albany citizens drank a pipe of
wine, and smoked much tobacco. They
broke hundreds of pipes and all the decanters
in the house, and wound up by burning122
all their funeral scarfs in a heap in the fireplace.
At Albany the expense reached the
climax. The obsequies of the first wife of
Stephen Van Renssalaer cost $20,000; two
thousand linen scarfs were given and all the
tenants were entertained several days.

On Long Island a young man of good
family began his youth by laying aside
money in gold coin for his funeral, and a superior
stock of wine was also stored for the
same occasion. In Albany a cask of choice
Madeira was bought for the wedding and
used in part; the remainder was saved for
the funeral of the bridegroom. Up the
Hudson were the vast manors of the Beekmans,
Livingstons, Van Renssalaers, Schuylers,
and Johnsons, where these patroons
lived among and ruled over their tenantry
like the feudal lords of old England. When
a member of the Van Renssalaer family died,
the tenants, sometimes amounting to several
thousand, says Bishop Kip, came down to
Albany to pay their respects to his memory,
and to drink to the peace of his soul in good
ale from his generous cellars. At the burial123
of Philip Livingston, in New York, services
were performed at both his house and at the
manor house. The funeral is thus described
in a journal of the day: "In the City the
lower rooms of most of the houses in Broadstreet,
where he resided, were thrown open
to receive visitors. A pipe of wine was
spiced for the occasion, and to each of the
eight bearers, with a pair of gloves, mourning
ring, scarf and handkerchief, a monkey
spoon was given. At the manor these ceremonies
were all repeated, another pipe of
wine was spiced, and besides the same presents
to the bearers, a pair of black gloves
and a handkerchief were given to each of the
tenants. The whole expense was said to be
five hundred pounds." At funerals in old
New York it was customary to serve hot
wine in winter and sangaree in summer.
Burnt wine was sometimes served in silver
tankards. Death among the Dutch involved
much besides mourning. "Bring me a Barrel
of Cutt Tobacco, some long pipes, I am
out also six silver Tankards. Bottles,
Glasses, Decanters we have enough. You124
must bring Cinnamon and Burnt wine, for
we have none," writes Will Livingston, in
1756, on the death of his mother.

Here is the funeral bill of Peter Jacobs
Marinus, one of the most prominent of old
time New York merchants, who died in the
latter part of the seventeenth century:

It should be noted that one of the perquisites
of the doctor's office was the sale of
spices, and on the occasion of funerals they
did a thriving business.

In 1764 a reform movement swept through
the northern colonies and stopped this extravagance
at funerals, so that when Judge
Clark died in New Jersey, in 1765, there
was no drinking at his funeral. Previous to
this time it was not unusual for testators to
direct that no liquor should be distributed
at their funeral, just as today the request is
made in regard to funerals that no flowers
be sent.

That the funeral of President Lincoln
cost the city of Chicago over eight hundred
dollars for the "mourners" was revealed
lately in an old whisky and wine bill discovered
by City Clerk John R. McCabe.
The bill is headed:

CHAPTER IX

Vendues       Chopping Bees       House Bees       Wood
Spells       Clearing Bees

In a new settlement more than half the
houses were log cabins. When a stranger
came to such a place to stay, the men built
him a cabin and made the building an occasion
for sport. The trees felled, four corner
men were elected to notch the logs, and
while they were busy the others ran races,
wrestled, played leap-frog, kicked the hat,
fought, gouged, gambled, drank, did everything
then considered amusement. It was
not luck that made these raisings a success.
It was skill and strength, and powers of endurance,
which could overcome and surmount
even the quantity of vile New England
rum with which the workmen were
plied during the day. In the older and
more settled parts of the country when the
first stones of a new wall were laid the masons
were given a case of brandy, an anker128
of brandy, and thirty-two gallons of other
liquid. When the beams were carried in by
eight men they had a half-barrel of beer for
every beam; when the beams were laid two
barrels of strong beer, three cases of brandy,
and seventy-two florins' worth of small beer.
This was the case in 1656 when the old fort
at Albany was removed and a new one built.
A tun of beer was furnished to the pullers
down, and in addition to the above items the
wood carriers, teamsters, carpenters, stone
cutters, and masons had, besides these special
treats, a daily dram of a gill of brandy
apiece, and three pints of beer at dinner.
They were dissatisfied and solicited another
pint of beer. Even the carters who brought
wood and boatmen who floated down spars
were served with liquor. When the carpenters
placed the roof tree a half-barrel of
liquor was given them; another half-barrel
of beer under the name of tiles beer went to
the tile setters. The special completion of
the winding staircase demanded five guilders'
worth of liquor. When the house was
finished a Kreag or house warming of both
food and drink to all the workmen and their129
wives was demanded and refused. Well
might it be refused, when the liquor bill
without it amounted to seven hundred and
sixteen guilders. The whole cost of the fort
was twelve thousand, two hundred and thirteen
guilders, or about three thousand, five
hundred dollars. The liquor bill was about
three hundred dollars. When the building
was completed it was christened by breaking
over it a bottle of rum.

Chopping bees were the universal method
among pioneers of clearing ground in newly
settled districts. Sometimes this bee was
held to clear land for a newly married couple,
or a new neighbor, or one who had had
bad luck; but it was just as freely given to a
prosperous farmer though plentiful thanks
and plentiful rum were the only reward of
the willing workers.

Lyman Beecher, in his autobiography, describes
the ministers wood spell, which was
a bee held for the purpose of drawing and
cutting the winter's supply of wood for the
clergyman, and a large amount of beer and
cider was provided for the consumption of
the parishioners.

130
Old Ames, of Dedham, Massachusetts, in
1767, describes a corn-husking as follows:

"Possibly this leafe may last a Century
and fall in the hands of some inquisitive
person for whose entertainment I will inform
him that now there is a custom
amongst us of making an entertainment at
husking of Indian corn whereto all the
neighboring swains are invited, and after
the corn is finished they like the Hottentots
give three cheers or huzzars, but cannot
carry in the husks without a Rhum bottle;
they feign great exertion but do nothing
till Rhum enlivens them, when all is
done in a trice, then after a hearty meal
about ten o'clock at night they go to their
pastimes."

In 1687 William Fitzhugh wrote to Nicholas
Hayward, then in England, as follows:
"Upon finishing the first line at your corner
tree on the Potomac your brother Sam, myself
and some others drank your health."
The diary of old Governor Spottswood confirms
the custom of drinking at the completion
of a survey, for in 1716 he with some
other Virginia gentlemen and their retainers,131
a company of rangers and four Indians,
fifty-four persons in all, journeyed over the
Blue Ridge mountains and descended to the
Shenandoah Valley. After drinking the
King's health they descended the western
slope to the river, which they crossed and
named "Euphrates." The governor took
formal possession of the region for George
I., of England. Much light is thrown on
the convivial habits of Virginians at that
time by an entry found in the diary of the
chroniclers: "We got all the men together
and loaded their arms, and we drank the
King's health in champagne and fired a volley,
the prince's health in Burgundy and
fired a volley, and all the rest of the royal
family in claret and a volley; we drank the
Governor's health and fired another volley.
We had several sorts of liquor, viz: Virginia
red wine and white wine, Irish usquebaugh,
brandy, shrub, two sorts of rum, champagne,
canary, cherry punch, cider, etc."

It was the custom when land was transferred
that a libation should be poured to
Bacchus, and to such an extent was this carried
that when Peter Jefferson, the father of132
Thomas Jefferson, purchased four hundred
acres of Virginia land from his old friend
and neighbor, William Randolph, of Tuckahoe,
the consideration jovially named in the
deed is given as "Henry Weatherbourne's
Biggest Bowl of Arrack Punch."

The breaking of roads furnished another
occasion for the consumption of liquor, and
is well described by Whittier:



Next morn we wakened with the shout
Of merry voices high and clear;
And saw the teamsters drawing near
To break the drifted highways out.
Down the long hillside treading slow
We saw the half-buried oxen go,
Shaking the snow from heads uptost,
Their straining nostrils white with frost.
Before our door the straggling train
Drew up, an added team to gain.
The elders threshed their hand a-cold,
Passed, with the cider mug, their jokes
From lip to lip.



Traveling and Taverns

Traveling in ye olden time was by stage
going at the rate of ten miles an hour, always
stopping at taverns for meals and giving passengers
an opportunity to visit the bar to imbibe133
Holland gin and sugar-house molasses,
a popular morning beverage. When the
Revolution came most of these vehicles
ceased to ply between the distant cities;
horseback traveling was resumed, and a
journey of any length became a matter of
grave consideration. On the day of departure
the friends of the traveler gathered at
the inn, took a solemn leave of him, drank
his health in bumpers of punch, and wished
him God-speed on his way. It was no uncommon
thing for one who went on business
or pleasure from Charleston to Boston or
New York to consult the almanac before
setting out and to make his will. A traveler
was a marked man, and his arrival at an ordinary
was the signal for the gathering of all
who could crowd in to hear his adventures
and also the news. Colonel Byrd was a typical
cavalier, and in writing of his visit to
Germanna shows an appreciation of the
good things of life, with a hearty good will
toward his neighbor and especially his
neighbor's wife, and a zest for all good
things to eat and drink. In his trips he
smacks his lips over the fat things that fall134
in his way. Now it is a prime rasher of bacon,
fricasseed in rum; now a capacious
bowl of bombo. He tells how he commended
his family to the Almighty, fortified himself
with a beefsteak, and kissed his landlady
for good luck, before setting out on his
travels.

The liquor traffic added to the discomforts
of travel by water. At New York until
the rude steamboats of Fulton made their
appearance on the ferry, the only means of
transportation for man and beast were clumsy
row-boats, flat bottomed, square ended
scows with sprit-sails, and two masted boats
called periaguas. In one of these, if the day
were fine, if the tide were slack, if the waterman
were sober, and if the boat did not put
back several times to take in belated passengers
who were seen running down the hill,
the crossing might be made with some degree
of speed and comfort and a landing
effected at the foot of the steps at the pier
which, much enlarged, still forms part of
the Brooklyn slip of the Fulton Ferry.

Near Philadelphia at Gloucester Point, if
the wind and tide failed, the vessel dropped135
anchor for the night. If passengers were
anxious to be landed in haste they were
charged half a dollar each to be rowed
ashore. At one in the morning the tide
again turned. But the master was then
drunk and before he could be made to understand
what was wanted the tide was again
ebbing and the boat aground.

In the west and south the taverns were
generally bad. When Silas Deane and his
fellow delegates went down to the Continental
Congress in 1774 they found "no fruit,
bad rum, and nothing of the meat kind but
salt pork." At another tavern they had to
go out and "knock over three or four chickens
to be roasted for their dinner." No porter
was to be had at another inn, and the one
palatable drink was some bottled cider.

The Marquis de Chastelleux writes of
this region in 1790 in his Travels in North
America: Landing on a dark night at
Courtheath's Tavern the landlord complained
that he was obliged to live in this
out-of-the-way place of Pompton. He expressed
surprise at finding on the parlor
table copies of Milton, Addison, Richardson,136
and other authors of note. The cellar
was not so well stocked as the library. He
could get nothing but vile cider brandy, of
which he must make grog. The bill for a
night's lodging and food for himself, his
servants and horses, was $16.00.

Much might be written about the taverns,
which from the very beginning played an
important part in this cheerful, prosperous,
unplagued colonial life. Their faded signboards
swung in every street, and curious
old verses still remain to show us what our
wise forefathers liked to read. One little
pot-house had painted on its board these encouraging
lines:



This is the tree that never grew,
This is the bird that never flew;
This is the ship that never sailed,
This is the mug that never failed.



It was not against every tavern that the reproach
could be brought that each person
could not have a room to himself, or at least
clean sheets without paying extra. Many a
New England village inn could, in the opinion
of the most fastidious Frenchman, well
bear comparison with the best to be found in137
France. The neatness of the rooms, the
goodness of the beds, the cleanliness of the
sheets, the smallness of the reckoning, filled
him with amazement. Nothing like them
was to be met with in France. There the
wayfarer who stopped at an ordinary overnight
slept in a bug-infested bed, covered
himself with ill-washed sheets, drank adulterated
wine, and to the annoyance of greedy
servants was added the fear of being robbed.
But in New England he might with perfect
safety pass night after night at an inn whose
windows were destitute of shutters, and
whose doors had neither locks nor keys.
Save the post office it was the most frequented
house in town. The great room with its
low ceiling and neatly sanded floor, its
bright pewter dishes and stout-backed, slat-bottomed
chairs ranged along the walls, its
long table, its huge fireplace, with the
benches on each side, where the dogs slept at
night, and where the guests sat when the dip
candles were lighted, to drink mull and flip,
possessed some attractions for every one.
The place was at once the town hall and the
assembly room, the court house and the show138
tent, the tavern and the exchange. There
the selectmen met. There the judges sometimes
held court. On its door were fastened
the list of names drawn for the jury, notices
of vendues, offers for reward for stray cattle,
the names of tavern haunters, the advertisements
of the farmers who had the best seed-potatoes
and the best seed-corn for sale. It
was at the "General Green," or the "United
States Arms," or the "Bull's Head" that
wandering showmen exhibited their automatons
and musical clocks, that dancing masters
gave their lessons, that singing school
was held, that the caucus met, that the
Colonel stopped during general training.
The tavern porch was the rallying point
of the town; hither all news came; here
all news was discussed; hence all news was
disseminated. DeWitt Clinton in his famous
letters on political parties says: "In
every county or village inn the barroom is
the coffee room exchange, or place of intelligence,
where all the quid nuncs and newsmongers
and politicians of the district resort."
Many were the good reasons that
could be given to explain and justify attendance139
at an old-time tavern. One was the
fact that often the only newspaper that came
to town was kept therein. This dingy tavern
sheet often saw hard usage, for when it
went its rounds some could scarcely read it,
some but pretend to read it. One old fellow
in Newburyport opened it wide, gazed at it
with interest, and cried out to his neighbor
in much excitement: "Bad news! Terrible
gales, terrible gales, ships all bottom side
up," as indeed they were in his way of holding
the news sheet. The extent and purposes
to which the tavern sheet might be applied
can be guessed from the notice written
over the mantel-shelf in the taproom: "Gentlemen
learning to spell are requested to use
last week's news-letter." A picturesque and
grotesque element of tavern life was found
in those last leaves on the tree, the few of
Indian blood who lingered after the tribes
were scattered and nearly all were dead.
These tawnies could not be made as useful
in the tavern yard as the shiftless and shifting
negro element that also drifted to the
tavern, for the eastern Indian never loved a
horse as did the negro, and seldom became140
handy in the care of horses. These waifs of
either race, the half-breeds of both races,
circled around the tavern chiefly because a
few stray pennies might be earned there, and
also because within the tavern were plentiful
supplies of cider and rum.

In Pennsylvania the Moravians became
famous for their inns. The "Nazareth," the
"Rose," and the "Crown" at Bethlehem
were well known. The story of the Rose
Tavern is prettily told by Professor Reichel,
under the title "A Red Rose from The Olden
Time," it being built on land leased by
William Penn, on the rent of one red rose.
The best one of all however was "The Sun"
at Bethlehem, which was familiar for nearly
a century to all the people from Massachusetts
to the Carolinas. At different times the
inn has entertained beneath its roof nearly
all the signers of the Declaration of Independence,
most of the members of the Continental
Congress, and all the presidents of
the United States down to Lincoln. That
the wines were remarkable and that the inn
had its brand of Madeira, goes without saying.
The early Moravians lived largely on141
game, and cultivated a great variety of vegetables.
Deer and grouse were very abundant
on the barrens in the manor of the Red
Rose. It was long a favorite sporting
ground for Philadelphians, and the resort
of colonial governors. The wayfarers at
the inn lived on all delicacies in the greatest
abundance, together with the famous fruit,
trout, shad, and wild strawberries. Foreigners
who stopped there invariably declared
that the inn was fully equal to the
best in Europe. It was owned and managed
by the Moravian church as part of its
communal system.

A good southern hotel of which there
were few was a large brick building with a
long veranda in front. For a shilling and
sixpence, Virginia currency, the traveler
was shown to a neat bed in a well furnished
room up one flight of stairs. On the wall
was fastened a printed table of rates. From
this he learned that breakfast cost two shillings,
and dinner with grog or toddy was
three; that a quart of toddy was one and six,
that a bottle of porter was two and six, and
that the best Madeira wine sold for six shillings142
a quart. When he rose in the morning
he washed his face, not in his room, but on
the piazza, and ate his breakfast in the coolest
of dining rooms, at a table adorned with
pewter spoons and china plates. Off at one
side was a tub full of water wherein melons
and cucumbers, pitchers of milk and bottles
of wine, were placed to cool. Near by was
a water case which held the decanters. If
he called for water a wench brought it fresh
from the spring, and he drank from a glass
which had long been cooling in a barrel
which stood in one corner of the room. In
winter the fire blazed high on the hearth,
and the toddy hissed in the noggin; in summer
the basket of fruit stood in the breeze-swept
hall, and lightly clad black boys
tripped in bearing cool tankards of punch
and sangaree.

For his lodging and his board, if he ate
a cold supper, and was content with one
quart of toddy, he paid to the landlord of
the Eagle ten shillings, Virginia currency,
or one dollar and sixty-six cents federal
money, each day. As to New York taverns,143
in a letter written by Dr. Mitchel in September,
1794, he states: "The Tontine Coffee
House, under the care of Mr. Hyde is
the best hotel in New York. He sets from
twelve to sixteen dishes every day. He
charges for a years board without liquor
Three Hundred and Fifty to Four Hundred
Dollars."

In Gloucester, Massachusetts, as in other
towns the selectmen held their meetings in
the tavern. There were five selectmen in
1744, whose salary was five dollars apiece.
Their tavern bill, however, amounted to thirty
pounds. The following year the citizens
voted the selectmen a salary of five pounds
apiece and "to find themselves."

In 1825 the expense of living at the Indian
Queen in Washington was not great.
The price of board was $1.75 per day,
$10.00 a week, or $35.00 a month. Brandy
and whiskey were placed on the tables in
decanters to be drunk by the guests without
additional charge therefor. A bottle of real
old Madeira imported into Alexandria was
supplied for $3.00; sherry, brandy, and gin144
were $1.00 per bottle, and Jamaica rum
$1.00. At the bar toddies were made with
unadulterated liquor and lump sugar, and
the charge was twelve and a half cents a
drink.

CHAPTER X

Extent and Effect of the Traffic at
Flood Tide

In 1648 one-fourth of the buildings of
New Amsterdam, or New York, were tap-houses.

In his notes on Virginia, Jefferson states
that in 1682 there were in Virginia fifty-three
thousand, two hundred and eighty-nine
free males above twenty-one years of
age and one hundred and ninety-one taverns.
About this time their number was so great
that they were limited by law in each county
to one at the court house and one at the
ferry.

The diary of Judge Sewall shows that in
1714 Boston had a population of ten thousand,
with thirty-four ordinaries, of whom
twelve were women; four common victuallers,
of whom one was a woman; forty-one
retailers of liquor, of whom seventeen were
women, and a few cider sellers.

146
As soon as the white settlers had planted
themselves at Pittsburgh they made requisition
on Philadelphia for six thousand kegs
of flour and three thousand kegs of whiskey.
There were distilleries on nearly every
stream emptying into the Monongahela.

The Chicago directory for 1830 classified
its business interests as taverns, two; Indian
traders, three; butchers, one; merchants,
one; with a poll list of thirty-two voters.

So much seed sown from the earliest
times produced a bountiful harvest. In
1633 Winthrop complains that workmen
were idle in spite of high wages because
they spent so much in tobacco and strong
waters. About this time drunkenness greatly
increased and deprived the custom of
bundling of whatever innocence it may have
had remaining.

Josselyn, in 1675, gives a graphic description
of the extravagance and drunkenness of
the cod fishermen, stating that at the end of
each voyage they drank up their earnings.
In this year Cotton Mather said every house
in Boston was an ale house. In 1696 Nathaniel
Saltonstall, of Haverhill, Massachusetts,147
a judge who had refused to sit in the
Salem witchcraft cases, wrote a letter to the
Salem court remonstrating against licensing
public houses. In 1678 Dr. Increase Mather
said: "Many of the rising generation are
profane, drunkards, swearers licentious and
scoffers at the power of godliness." Dankers
and Sluyter, in 1680, comment on the
puritanical laws and say, "drinking and
fighting occur there not less than elsewhere
and as to truth and true godliness you must
not expect more of them than of others."

The Reverend John Miller, in his history
of New York, says: "'Tis in this country
a common thing even for the meanest persons
as soon as the bounty of God has furnished
them with a bountiful crop to turn
what they can as soon as may be into money,
and that money into drinks, at the same time
when their family at home have nothing but
rags to resist the winter's cold; nay if the
fruits of their plantations be such as are by
their own immediate labor convertible into
liquor such as cider, perry, etc., they have
scarce the patience to wait till it is fit for
drinking but inviting their boon companions148
they all of them neglecting whatever work
they are about, set to it together and give not
over till they have drunk it off. And to these
sottish engagements they will make nothing
to ride ten or fifteen miles and at the conclusion
of one debauch another is generally
appointed except their stock of liquor fail
them." In his history of New Haven Henry
Atwater states: "A brew-house was regarded
as an essential part of a homestead, and
beer was on the table as regularly as bread."
When in Stuyvesant's day it was reported
that fully one-fourth of the houses in New
Amsterdam were devoted to the sale of
brandy, tobacco, and beer, Mr. Roberts observed:

"Their existence tells the story of the habits
of the people. It was when Governor
Sloughter was besotted with drink that he
signed the illegal death warrant of Leisler;
it was when the informer Kane was possessed
by the fumes of liquor of the tavern,
that he foisted upon the terrified colonists
the lying details of the shameful negro plot;
it was when the representative of the most
powerful family in the province, Chief Justice149
DeLancey, and Governor Clinton, the
proxy of the King, were 'in their cups' that
a personal quarrel led to antagonisms that
threatened the welfare of the colony. Indeed
the deep hold that this vice had upon
the morals of the entire colony seemed to repeat
and emphasize the wisdom of the name
which the earlier Spanish in an intercourse
had fastened upon its leading town       Monafos       'the
place of the drunken men.'"

Whiskey as Money

In a large part of the territory now the
United States the early settlers lived in the
rudest kind of log cabins and knew no other
money than whiskey and the skins of wild
beasts. In 1780, after the collapse of the
continental currency, it seemed there was no
money in the country, and in the absence of
a circulating medium there was a reversion
to the practice of barter, and the revival of
business was thus further impeded. Whiskey
in North Carolina and tobacco in Virginia
did duty as measures of value. In
Pennsylvania what a bank bill was at Philadelphia
or a shilling piece at Lancaster,150
whiskey was in the towns and villages that
lay along the banks of the Monongahela
river. It was the money, the circulating
medium of the country. A gallon of good
whiskey at every store in Pittsburgh, and at
every farmhouse in the four counties of
Washington, Westmoreland, Alleghany, and
Fayette, was the equivalent of a shilling.
And when, in 1797, the government began
to coin new money for the people, the new
coins did not, many of them, go far from the
seaports and great towns. In the country
districts, in the Ohio valley, on the northern
border they were still unknown. The school-master
received his pittance in French
crowns and Spanish half-joes. The boatmen
were paid their hire in shillings and
pence, and if perchance some traveler paid
his reckoning at a tavern with a few American
coins, they were beheld with wonder by
every lounger who came there to smoke and
drink.

Temperance Societies

The first prohibitory law was that of
Georgia, in 1733, and the first dawn of temperance
sentiment was undoubtedly the151
pledge of Governor Winthrop, still earlier
than this, when he announced his famous
discountenance of health drinking. This
first of all temperance pledges in New England
is recorded in his diary in language as
temperate as his intent:

"The Governor, upon consideration of the
inconveniences which have grown in New
England by drinking one to another, restrained
it at his own table, and wished others
to do the like; so it grew little by little,
into disuse."

Lyman Beecher claims the Massachusetts
temperance society formed in 1813 to be the
first one, the pledge of its members being to
discontinue the use of liquor at entertainments,
funerals, and auction sales, and to
abstain from furnishing laborers with grog
during haying time, as was then the custom.
John B. Gough, however, mentions the constitution
of a temperance society formed in
New York in 1809, one of whose by-laws
was, "Any member of this association who
shall be convicted of intoxication shall be
fined a quarter of a dollar, except such act
of intoxication shall take place on the152
Fourth of July, or any other regularly appointed
military muster."

In 1817 a committee of New York citizens
appointed to investigate the causes of
pauperism reported that seven-eighths of the
paupers were reduced to abject poverty by
the sale of liquor. As far back as 1809 the
Humane Society found eighteen hundred
licensed dramshops scattered over the city,
retailing liquor in small quantities, and offering
every inducement to the poor to drink.

New Hampshire required a selectman of
each town to post the names of tipplers in
every tavern and fined anyone ten dollars
who sold them liquor. About this same
time the legislature of Pennsylvania passed
a law authorizing the governor to appoint
a commission of nine to investigate the
causes of pauperism in Philadelphia, and
to report to the next legislature. The farmers
of Upper Providence township, Pennsylvania,
met in the school house just before
harvest time and agreed not to give
liquor to their harvest hands, nor to use it in
the hay field or during harvest, nor to allow
any one in their employ to use it. A general153
movement for temperance swept over
the Atlantic states. The Portland Society,
auxiliary to the Massachusetts Society for
Suppressing Intemperance, reported that
out of eighty-five persons in the workhouse,
seventy-one became paupers through drink.
A grand jury at Albany drew a picture of
their city quite as dismal, and presented the
immense number of dramshops and corner
groceries where liquor was retailed by the
cent's worth as an evil and a nuisance to
society.

One of the most interesting documents in
early temperance agitation is the letter of the
mayor of Philadelphia in 1821, showing the
condition of the liquor traffic at that time.
He pointed out the dangers of the tippling
houses and corner groceries, where liquor
was sold by the cent's worth to children five
years old, and paid for often with stolen
goods.

The liquor traffic left an indelible impress
upon the geography of the country.
The oldest American reference to the word
RUM is in the Massachusetts statute of 1657
prohibiting the sale of strong liquors154
"whether known by the name of rum, strong
water, brandywine, etc." The Dutch in
New York called rum brandywine, and it
conferred its name upon the river which in
turn gave its name to one of the most famous
battles of the Revolution. Among places
may be found such names as Rumford,
Wineland, Winesburg, and others.

When in 1828 Mr. Garrison assumed the
editorial control of the Journal of the Times
at Bennington, Vermont, he distinctly
avowed that he had three objects in view,
"The suppression of Intemperance and its
associate vices, the gradual emancipation of
every slave in the Republic, the perpetuity
of the national peace." He contributed to
the third object; he accomplished the second;
the first problem he left unsolved as a
bequest to this generation.


Transcribers' Notes

Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.

Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks retained.

Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.

Page 84: "seargeant" was spelled that way.

Page 115: The closing quotation mark for the phrase beginning 'and "Tom
the Tinker was shortly evolved' probably should follow 'the Tinker', but
was printed at the end of the sentence, and has not been moved.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
