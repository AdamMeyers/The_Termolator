<h2>THE TALE OF<br />
FERDINAND FROG</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>I</h2>

<h3>PRETTY AS A PICTURE</h3>


<p>There was something about Ferdinand
Frog that made everybody smile. It may
have been his amazingly wide mouth and
his queer, bulging eyes, or perhaps it was
his sprightly manner&mdash;for one never
could tell when Mr. Frog would leap into
the air, or turn a somersault backward.
Indeed, some of his neighbors claimed
that he himself didn't know what he was
going to do next&mdash;he was so <i>jumpy</i>.</p>

<p>Anyhow, all the wild folk in Pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Valley agreed that Ferdinand Frog was
an agreeable person to have around. No
matter what happened, he was always
cheerful. Nobody ever heard of his losing
his temper, though to be sure he was
sometimes the means of other peoples
losing theirs. But let a body be as angry
as he pleased with Mr. Frog, Mr. Frog
would continue to smile and smirk.</p>

<p>Of course, such extreme cheerfulness
often made angry folk only the more
furious, especially when the whole trouble
was Ferdinand Frog's own fault.
But it made no difference to him what
blunder he had made. He was always
ready to make another&mdash;and smile at the
same time.</p>

<p>Really, he was so good-natured that
nobody could feel peevish towards him
for long. In fact, he was a great favorite&mdash;especially
among the ladies. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>ever
he met one of them&mdash;it might be
the youngest of the Rabbit sisters, or old
Aunt Polly Woodchuck&mdash;he never failed
to make the lowest of bows, smile the
broadest of smiles, and inquire after her
health.</p>

<p>That was Ferdinand Frog&mdash;known far
and wide for his elegant manners. Every
young lady declared that he wore exquisite
clothes, too; and many of them
secretly thought him quite good-looking.</p>

<p>But people as old as Aunt Polly Woodchuck
seldom take heed of what a person
wears. As for Mr. Frog's looks,
since Aunt Polly believed that "handsome
is as handsome does," she admitted
that Ferdinand Frog was&mdash;as she put it&mdash;"purty
as a picter."</p>

<p>When Ferdinand Frog heard that, he
was so delighted that he hurried straight
home and put on his best suit. And then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he spent most of a whole afternoon smiling
at his reflection in the surface of the
Beaver pond, where he was living at the
time.</p>

<p>So it is easy to see that Ferdinand
Frog was a vain and silly fellow. He
was even foolish enough to repeat Aunt
Polly's remark to everybody he chanced
to meet that night, and the following day
as well.</p>

<p>There was no one who could help grinning
at Ferdinand Frog's news&mdash;he
looked so comical. And old Mr. Crow,
who was noted for his rudeness, even
burst out with a hoarse <i>haw-haw</i>.</p>

<p>"You're pretty as a picture, eh?" he
chuckled. "I suppose Aunt Polly means
that you're as pretty as one of the pictures
that the circus men have pasted on
Farmer Green's barn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I believe&mdash;&mdash;"
he added, as he stared at Ferdi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>nand
Frog&mdash;&mdash;"I believe I know which
one Aunt Polly means."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" cried Mr. Frog, swelling
himself up&mdash;through pride&mdash;until it
seemed that he must burst. "Oh, which
picture is it?"</p>

<p>"It's the one in the upper left-hand
corner," old Mr. Crow informed him solemnly.
"And if you haven't yet seen it,
you should take a good look at it soon."</p>

<p>"I will!" Ferdinand Frog declared.
"I'll visit Farmer Green's place this
very night!"</p>

<p>And he opened his mouth and smiled
so widely that old Mr. Crow couldn't
help shuddering&mdash;though he knew well
enough that Ferdinand Frog could never
swallow anyone as big as he was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>II</h2>

<h3>THE DANGERS OF TRAVEL</h3>


<p>It was a long way to Farmer Green's
from the Beaver pond where Ferdinand
Frog made his home. But he felt that
he simply <i>must</i> see that picture which
Mr. Crow said looked like him. So he
started out just before sunset.</p>

<p>One thing, at least, about his journey
pleased him: he could make the trip by
water&mdash;and he certainly did hate travelling
on land.</p>

<p>Luckily the stream that trickled its
way below the Beaver dam led straight
to Swift River. And everybody who
knew anything was aware that Swift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
River ran right under the bridge not
far from the farmhouse.</p>

<p>So Mr. Frog leaped spryly into the
brook and struck out downstream.</p>

<p>He was a famous swimmer, having
been used to the water from the time he
was a tadpole. And now he swam so
fast, with the help of the current, that he
reached the river by the time the moon
was up.</p>

<p>As he looked up at the sky Ferdinand
Frog was both glad and sorry that there
was a moon that night. The moon would
be a good thing, provided he reached the
end of his journey, for it would give him
a fine clear view of the picture on the
barn, which he so much wanted to see.
On the other hand, he would have preferred
a dark night for a swim in Swift
River. There were fish there&mdash;pickerel&mdash;which
would rather swallow him than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
not. And he knew that they were sure
to be feeding by the light of the moon.</p>

<p>If Mr. Frog hadn't always looked on
the bright side of life no doubt he would
have waited a week or two, until there
was no moon at all. But he remarked
to himself with a grin, as he hurried
along, that he had never yet seen the
pickerel that was quick enough to catch
him, and furthermore, he never expected
to.</p>

<p>But those words were hardly out of
Ferdinand Frog's mouth when he turned
and made for the bank as fast as he
could go. He had caught sight of a dark,
long-nosed fish lying among some weeds.
And he decided suddenly that he would
finish his journey by land.</p>

<p>"It would be a shame&mdash;&mdash;" he told
himself, as he flopped up the steep bank&mdash;&mdash;"it
would be a shame for so hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>some
a person as I am to be eaten by a
fish."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't object to a bird,
would you?" said a voice right in Ferdinand
Frog's ear&mdash;or so it seemed to him.</p>

<p>He made no answer&mdash;not even stopping
to bow, or say good evening&mdash;but
turned a somersault backward and hid
himself under the overhanging bank.</p>

<p>It was Solomon Owl who had spoken
to him. There was no mistaking the
loud, mocking laughter that followed Mr.
Frog's hasty retreat.</p>

<p>"Solomon Owl is a great joker," Mr.
Frog murmured with a smile. "He was
only teasing me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Still, he might be
a bit hungry. So I'll stay here out of
harm's way for a while, for it would be a
shame for so handsome a person as I am
to be eaten by an old, rascally bird like
Solomon Owl."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>One can judge, just by that remark,
that Ferdinand Frog was not quite so
polite as his neighbors supposed&mdash;<i>when
there was no one to hear what he said</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>III</h2>

<h3>MR. FROG'S DOUBLE</h3>


<p>Mr. Frog waited until it was broad
daylight before he left his hiding place
beneath the bank of the river. He knew
that by that time Solomon Owl must have
gone home to his hemlock tree to get his
rest. So Ferdinand Frog felt quite safe
again.</p>

<p>Having made up his mind that he
would finish his journey to Farmer
Green's place by land, he started briskly
across the cornfield, travelling in a
straight line between two rows of young
corn.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before a hoarse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
voice called to him. But this time he was
not alarmed.</p>

<p>It was only old Mr. Crow, who seemed
greatly pleased to see him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, young fellow!" said Mr. Crow.
"If you're on your way to the barn to
look at that picture, I'll fly over there
myself, because I'd like to see it again."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid of meeting Farmer
Green?" Ferdinand Frog asked him.</p>

<p>"Afraid?" Mr. Crow snorted. "Certainly
not! We're the best of friends.
He set up this straw man here, just to
keep me company.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Besides," he
went on, "at this time o' day Farmer
Green is inside the barn, milking the
cows. And we'll be outside it, looking at
the circus pictures."</p>

<p>"We can call to him, if you want to
say good morning to him," Ferdinand
Frog suggested cheerfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no!" his companion said quickly.
"I wouldn't want to do that&mdash;he's so
busy."</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog smiled. And for
some reason old Mr. Crow seemed displeased.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" he inquired in a
surly tone. "Something seems to amuse
you. Why are you grinning?"</p>

<p>"It's just a habit I have," Ferdinand
Frog explained.</p>

<p>"I'd try to break myself of that habit,
if I were you," Mr. Crow advised him.
"Some day it will get you into trouble,
for you're likely to grin when you
oughtn't to. There's a wrong time and
a right time for everything, you know."</p>

<p>"Just as there is for planting corn,"
Mr. Frog chimed in.</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Mr. Crow returned.</p>

<p>"And for eating it!" Mr. Frog added.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>But old Mr. Crow only said hastily
that he would be at the barn by the time
Ferdinand reached it. And without another
word he flapped himself away
across the field.</p>

<p>"He's a queer one," said Ferdinand
Frog to himself. "It seems as if a person
couldn't please him, no matter how
much a person tried." Then he untied
his necktie, and tied it again, because he
thought one end of the bow was longer
than the other; and that was something
he couldn't endure.</p>

<p>Then he resumed his jumping. And
after exactly one hundred and thirty-two
jumps he reached a corner of Farmer
Green's great barn, where he found old
Mr. Crow waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Still smiling, I see," the old gentleman
observed gruffly. "Maybe you'll
laugh out of the other corner of your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
mouth after you've seen the pretty picture
that you look like."</p>

<p>"I hope so! Where is it?" Ferdinand
Frog asked him eagerly. "Show me the
pretty one!"</p>

<p>"Come with me!" said old Mr. Crow.
And he led the way around the barn,
stopping before the side that faced the
road.</p>

<p>"There!" he cried. "It's in the upper
left-hand corner, just as I told you."
And he chuckled as loud as he dared&mdash;with
Farmer Green inside the building,
milking the cows.</p>

<p>As Ferdinand Frog gazed upward a
shadow of disappointment came over his
face. And for once he did not smile.</p>

<p>"Do I look like that?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"You certainly do," old Mr. Crow assured
him. "See those eyes&mdash;don't they
bulge just like yours? And look at that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
mouth! It's fully as wide as yours&mdash;and
maybe a trifle wider!"</p>

<p>"The face does look a bit like mine,
I'll admit," Ferdinand Frog muttered.
"But no one could ever mistake one of us
for the other.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What's the name of
this creature?"</p>

<p>"It's called the <i>hippopotamus</i>," old
Mr. Crow replied. "I heard Johnnie
Green say so. And he ought to know, if
anyone does."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>MR. CROW LOSES SOMETHING</h3>


<p>The picture of the hippopotamus on
Farmer Green's barn did not please Ferdinand
Frog. But in a few moments he
began to smile again.</p>

<p>"You've made a mistake," he told old
Mr. Crow with a snicker. "When Aunt
Polly Woodchuck said I was as pretty
as a picture she never could have had
this one in mind."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Mr. Crow inquired.
"The eyes and the mouth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes&mdash;I know!" Ferdinand interrupted.
"But this creature has a
tail! And tails are terribly out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
fashion. I haven't worn one since I was
a tadpole."</p>

<p>That was enough for old Mr. Crow. <i>He</i>
had a tail&mdash;&mdash;or tail feathers, at least.
And he at once flew into a terrible rage.</p>

<p>"You've insulted me!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog knew then that he
had blundered. So he hastened to mend
matters.</p>

<p>"There, there!" he said in a soothing
tone. "Having a tail is not so bad, after
all; for you can always cut it off, if you
want to be in style." And he was surprised
to find that his remark only made
Mr. Crow angrier than ever.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/illus-1.jpg" width="275" height="400" alt="Old Mr. Crow Plays a Joke on Mr. Frog" title="Old Mr. Crow Plays a Joke on Mr. Frog" />
<span class="caption">Old Mr. Crow Plays a Joke on Mr. Frog</span>
</div>

<p>"Cut off my tail, indeed!" the old gentleman
snorted. "I'd be a pretty sight,
if I did. Why, I wouldn't part with a
single tail-feather, on any account." He
continued to scold Ferdinand Frog at
the top of his lungs, telling him that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
was a silly fellow, and that nobody&mdash;unless
it was a few foolish young creatures&mdash;thought
he was the least bit handsome.</p>

<p>Now, old Mr. Crow was in such a temper
that he forgot that Farmer Green
was inside the barn. And he made so
much noise that Farmer Green heard
him and peeped around the corner of
the barn to see what was going on.</p>

<p>A moment later the old shot-gun went
off with a terrific roar. Ferdinand Frog
saw Mr. Crow spring up and go tearing
off towards the woods. And a long,
black tail-feather floated slowly down out
of the air and settled on the ground near
the place where Mr. Crow had been
standing.</p>

<p>After shaking his fist in Mr. Crow's
direction, Farmer Green disappeared.</p>

<p>"That's a pity," Mr. Frog thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
"Mr. Crow has parted with one of his
tail-feathers. And I must find him as
soon as I can and tell him how sorry
I am."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Frog turned to look at the
other pictures, which covered the whole
side of the big barn. He beheld many
strange creatures&mdash;some with necks of
enormous length, some with humps on
their backs, and all of them of amazing
colors.</p>

<p>But whether they were ringed, streaked
or striped, not one of them was&mdash;in Mr.
Frog's opinion&mdash;one-half as beautiful as
the hippopotamus.</p>

<p>"Even he&mdash;&mdash;" Mr. Frog decided&mdash;&mdash;"even
he couldn't be called half as handsome
as I am. For once old Mr. Crow
certainly was mistaken."</p>

<p>And he began to laugh. And while he
was laughing, Farmer Green came out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the barn with a pail of milk in each hand.</p>

<p>Then Ferdinand Frog had a happy
thought. Why not ask Farmer Green
to shoot off the tail of the hippopotamus?
The loss of that ugly tail would improve
the creature's looks, and make him appear
still more like Mr. Frog himself.</p>

<p>At least, that was Mr. Frog's own
opinion.</p>

<p>And he called to Farmer Green and
suggested to him that he step out behind
the barn and take a shot at the tail of
the hippopotamus.</p>

<p>"Try your luck!" Mr. Frog coaxed.
"It's plain to see that you need practice,
or you'd have made Mr. Crow part with
all his tail-feathers, instead of only one."
And he laughed harder than ever.</p>

<p>But Farmer Green paid little heed to
Ferdinand Frog's wheedling, although he
did smile and say:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare, I believe that bull frog's
jeering at me because I missed the old
crow!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<h3>MR. FROG'S SECRET SORROW</h3>


<p>Ferdinand Frog always looked so cheerful
that no one ever suspected that he
had a secret sorrow. But it is true,
nevertheless, that something troubled
him, though he took great pains not to
let a single one of his neighbors know
that anything grieved him.</p>

<p>His trouble was simply this: he had
never been invited to attend the singing-parties
which the Frog family held almost
every evening in Cedar Swamp.</p>

<p>Now, Ferdinand Frog loved to sing at
night.</p>

<p>Indeed, he liked nothing better than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to go to the lake not far from the Beaver
dam and practice his songs among
the lily pads near the shore. He had
a deep, powerful bass voice, which one
could hear a mile or more across the
water on a still evening.</p>

<p>Often he dressed himself with the
greatest care and went to the lake alone,
where he stayed half the night and sang
so loudly that a good many of the wild
folk who lived in the neighborhood
thought him a great nuisance. Not caring
for music, they objected to being
forced to listen to Ferdinand Frog's favorite
songs.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go over to Cedar
Swamp, if you want to make a noise?"
one of the Beaver family who was known
as Tired Tim asked Mr. Frog one evening.
"You have come here for nine
nights running; and your racket has up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>set
me so that I haven't done a stroke of
work in all this time."</p>

<p>Mr. Frog had puffed himself up and
had just opened his mouth to begin a
new song. But upon being spoken to so
rudely he closed his mouth quickly and
swallowed several times. For just a second
or two he was speechless, he was so
surprised. And then presently he began
to giggle.</p>

<p>"I believe you," he said. "I believe
that you haven't done a stroke of work
for ninety nights." He knew&mdash;as did
everybody else&mdash;that Tired Tim was the
laziest person for miles around.</p>

<p>"I said nine&mdash;not ninety," Tired Tim
corrected him.</p>

<p>"Oh! My mistake!" Mr. Frog replied.</p>

<p>"You haven't answered my question,"
Tired Tim reminded him with a wide
yawn. "I asked you why you didn't at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>tend
the singing-parties over in Cedar
Swamp. You could croak your head off
there and no one would stop you."</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog shook his head. And at
the same time, he sighed.</p>

<p>"No!" he said. "I'd rather sing here
on the border of the lake. The trouble is,
<i>I sing too well</i> for those fellows over in
Cedar Swamp."</p>

<p>"Why don't you join them and teach
them how to sing, if you know so much
about it?" Tired Tim persisted.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no time for that," Ferdinand
Frog answered.</p>

<p>And then it was his companion's turn
to snicker.</p>

<p>"You appear to have plenty of time to
waste here," he observed. "It's my opinion
that there's just one reason why you
don't go to the Cedar Swamp singing
parties."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's that?" Mr. Frog inquired
with a slight trace of uneasiness.</p>

<p>"They haven't invited you."</p>

<p>"How did you guess that?" Ferdinand
Frog asked him.</p>

<p>He wished, the next moment, that he
had not put that question to Tired Tim.
For he saw at once that he had given his
sad secret away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>TIRED TIM DOES A FAVOR</h3>


<p>In spite of all Ferdinand Frog's teasing,
Tired Tim Beaver refused to explain
how he happened to know Mr. Frog's secret.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, he had <i>guessed</i> the
reason why Mr. Frog did not attend the
Cedar Swamp singing-parties. But he
hoped that Ferdinand Frog would think
that some of the musical Frog family
had been talking to him. And he even
hinted to Mr. Frog that maybe it would
be possible to get him an invitation to
the singing-parties.</p>

<p>"Do you think you could do that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Ferdinand Frog asked him with, great
eagerness.</p>

<p>"I <i>might</i> be able to; but it wouldn't
be an easy matter," Tired Tim replied.
"And I'd expect you to do something
for me, if I went to so much trouble on
your account."</p>

<p>"I'll do <i>anything</i> for you, in return
for an invitation to the Cedar Swamp
singing-parties," Ferdinand Frog declared.</p>

<p>"Very well!" Tired Tim told him.
"I'll go right over to the swamp now.
And when I tell 'em a few things, I
know they'll want you to join 'em."</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog felt so gay that he
stood on his head and waved his feet in
the air.</p>

<p>"Let's meet here to-morrow night,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>But Tired Tim objected to that plan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would be hanging about this
place&mdash;and singing&mdash;for four-and-twenty
hours," he grumbled. "It will be a great
deal better if we meet on the edge of the
swamp."</p>

<p>"Just as you wish!" Ferdinand Frog
exclaimed. "And since you're going to
Cedar Swamp, I'll hop along with you,
to keep you company."</p>

<p>"You forget&mdash;&mdash;" said Tired Tim
Beaver&mdash;&mdash;"you forget that you haven't
been invited yet."</p>

<p>"Have you?" Mr. Frog inquired.</p>

<p>"Certainly!" said Tired Tim. And
grinning over his shoulder, he swam
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog watched his friend from the
shore.</p>

<p>"He can't fool me," he muttered.
"Tired Tim <i>invited himself</i>. And I've
been stupid not to do likewise."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following night Ferdinand
Frog went to the edge of Cedar Swamp,
where he waited somewhat impatiently
on a log until Tired Tim Beaver joined
him.</p>

<p>"Well!" Mr. Frog cried. "I'm glad
to see you and I hope you've brought my
invitation."</p>

<p>But Tired Tim wouldn't say yes or no.</p>

<p>"If I succeed in getting you into the
Cedar Swamp singing-parties will you
promise me that you won't sing any more
around the lake, or near our pond,
either?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog gave his solemn promise.</p>

<p>"Very well, then!" Tired Tim said.
"Go along over to the swamp. They're
expecting you."</p>

<p>When he heard the good news Ferdinand
Frog was so delighted that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
leaped into the air and kicked his heels
together.</p>

<p>And then forgetting his solemn promise,
he began to bellow at the top of his
voice:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"To Cedar Swamp I'll haste away;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Though first I'll sing a song.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">My voice I must not waste to-day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So I'll not keep you long.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I simply want to let you know</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I'm much obliged, before I go."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Don't mention it!" said Tired Tim.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me, please!" said
Ferdinand Frog. "I haven't finished
thanking you yet. That's only the first
verse."</p>

<p>"How many more are there?" Tired
Tim inquired with a yawn.</p>

<p>"Ninety-nine!" Mr. Frog answered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
And he was somewhat surprised&mdash;and
puzzled&mdash;when Tired Tim left him suddenly
and plunged into the underbrush.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VII</h2>

<h3>THE SINGING-PARTY</h3>


<p>Ferdinand Frog lost no time, after
Tired Tim left him. He jumped into the
swamp and made straight towards the
very middle of it, whence he could already
hear the chorus of the numerous
Frog family; for the singing-party had
begun.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog made all haste, not wishing
to miss any more of the fun. Now swimming,
now leaping from one hummock to
another&mdash;or sometimes to an old stump&mdash;he
quickly reached the place where the
Frog family were enjoying themselves.</p>

<p>"Here he is!" several of the singers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
exclaimed as soon as Ferdinand Frog's
head popped out of the water, in their
midst.</p>

<p>He saw at once that they had been expecting
him; and he smiled and bowed&mdash;and
waited for the company to stop singing
and give him a warm greeting with
their cold, damp hands. But except for
those first few words, no one paid the
slightest attention to the newcomer.</p>

<p>In fact, nobody even took the trouble
to nod to Ferdinand Frog&mdash;much less to
shake hands with him and tell him that
he was welcome.</p>

<p>Meanwhile one song followed another
with hardly a pause between them. And
Mr. Frog found that he did not know the
words of even one.</p>

<p>He was so impatient that at last he
climbed upon an old fallen tree-trunk,
which stuck out of the greenish-black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
water, and began to roar his favorite
song, while he beat time for the other
singers. The name of that song was "A
Frog on a Log in a Bog"; and Ferdinand
Frog thought that he couldn't have chosen
another so fitting.</p>

<p>But the rest of the singing-party had
other ideas. They turned about and
scowled at Mr. Frog as if he had done
something most unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" several of them cried.
And an important-looking fellow near
him shouted, "Don't sing that, for pity's
sake!"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Ferdinand Frog faltered.
"What's the matter with my song? It's
my special favorite, which I sing at
least fifty times each night, regularly."</p>

<p>"It's old stuff," the other told him
with a sneer. "We haven't sung that
for a year, at least."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog did not try to argue
with him. But as soon as he saw another
chance he began a different ditty.</p>

<p>Then a loud groan arose. And somebody
stopped him again. And Mr. Frog
soon learned that they hadn't sung that
one for a year and a half.</p>

<p>Though he tried again and again, he
had no better luck. But he kept smiling
bravely. And finally he asked the company
in a loud voice if he "wasn't going
to have a chance."</p>

<p>"Certainly!" a number of the singers
assured him. "Your chance is coming
later. We shan't forget you."</p>

<p>And that made Ferdinand Frog feel
better. He told himself that he could
wait patiently for a time&mdash;if it wasn't
too long.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>THE MISSING SUPPER</h3>


<p>Ferdinand Frog had begun to feel uneasy
again. He was afraid that the singers
had forgotten their promise to him.
But at last they suddenly started a rousing
song which made him take heart
again.</p>

<p>They roared out the chorus in a joyful
way which left no doubt in his mind that
his chance was at hand:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Now that the concert is ended<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We'll sit at the banquet and feast.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Now that the singing's suspended</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We'll dine till it's gray in the east."</span><br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Frog only hoped that the company
did not expect him to sing to them <i>all</i>
the time while they were banqueting.</p>

<p>"They needn't think&mdash;" he murmured
under his breath&mdash;"they needn't think
I don't like good things to eat as well
as they do." But he let no one see that
he was worried. That was Ferdinand
Frog's way: almost always he managed
to smile, no matter how things went.</p>

<p>When the last echoes of the song had
died away a great hubbub arose. Everybody
crowded around Mr. Frog. And
there were cries of "Now! Now!"</p>

<p>He thought, of course, that they wanted
to hear him sing. So he started once
more to sing his favorite song. But they
stopped him quickly.</p>

<p>"We've finished the songs for to-night,"
they told him. "We're ready for
the supper now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where is it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Supper?" Mr. Frog faltered, as his
jaw dropped. "What supper?"</p>

<p>"The supper you're going to give us!"
the whole company shouted. "You know&mdash;don't
you?&mdash;that we have just made a
rule for new members: they're to furnish
a banquet."</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog's eyes seemed to bulge
further out of his head than ever.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I never heard of this before!" he
stammered.</p>

<p>"Didn't Tired Tim tell you about our
new rule?" somebody inquired. "It was
his own idea."</p>

<p>"He never said a word to me about it!"
Ferdinand Frog declared with a loud
laugh. "And I can't give you a supper,
for I haven't one ready."</p>

<p>"Then we'll postpone it until to-morrow
night," the company told him hopefully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"What does your rule say?" Ferdinand
Frog rolled his eyes as he put the
question to them.</p>

<p>"It says that the banquet must take
place the first night the new member is
present," a fat gentleman replied.</p>

<p>"Then I can't give you any food to-morrow
night," Mr. Frog informed them,
"because it would be against the rule."</p>

<p>"Then you can't be a member!" a
hundred voices croaked.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> one now," Ferdinand Frog replied
happily. "And what's more, I
don't see how you can keep me out of
your singing-parties."</p>

<p>There was silence for a time.</p>

<p>"We've been sold," some one said at
last. "We've no rule to prevent this
fellow from coming here. And the worst
of it is, as everybody knows, his voice is
so loud it will spoil all our songs."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Oddly enough, the speaker was the
very one who had always objected to inviting
Ferdinand Frog to join the singing
parties. His own voice had always
been the loudest in the whole company.
And naturally he did not want anybody
with a louder one to come and drown his
best notes.</p>

<p>But now he couldn't help himself.
And thereafter when the singers met in
Cedar Swamp he always turned greener
in the face than ever and looked as if he
were about to burst, when Ferdinand
Frog opened his mouth its widest and let
his voice rumble forth into the night.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>IX</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER</h3>


<p>When Ferdinand Frog first came to the
Beaver pond to live no one knew anything
about him.</p>

<p>He appeared suddenly&mdash;no one knew
whence&mdash;and at once made himself very
much at home. It was no time at all before
he could call every one of the big
Beaver family by name. And he acted
exactly as if the pond belonged to him,
instead of to the Beavers, whose great-grandfathers
had dammed the stream
many years before.</p>

<p>But the newcomer was so polite that
nobody cared to send him away. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
same time, people couldn't help wondering
who the stranger was and where he
had come from and what his plans for
the future were. Whenever two or three
Beavers stopped working long enough to
enjoy a pleasant chat, they were sure to
talk of the mysterious Mr. Frog and tell
one another what they thought of him.
Many were the tales told about the nimble
fellow.</p>

<p>Some said that he had moved all the
way from Farmer Green's duck pond,
because Johnnie Green had tried to catch
him; while others declared that Ferdinand
Frog was a famous singer, who
had come to that quiet spot in order to
rest his voice, which had become harsh
from too much use. Indeed, there were
so many stories about the stranger that
it was hard to know which to believe&mdash;especially
after old Mr. Crow informed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Brownie Beaver that in his opinion Ferdinand
Frog was a slippery fellow. "I
shouldn't be surprised&mdash;&mdash;" Mr. Crow
had said with a wise wag of his head&mdash;&mdash;"I
shouldn't be surprised if his
real name was Ferdinand Fraud."</p>

<p>Anyhow, there was one thing that almost
all the Beaver colony agreed upon.
They were of one opinion as to Mr.
Frog's clothes, which they thought must
be very fashionable, because they were
like no others that had ever been seen
before in those parts.</p>

<p>There was one young gentleman, however&mdash;the
beau of the village&mdash;who disputed
everybody, saying that he believed
that Ferdinand Frog must be wearing
old clothes that were many years behind
the times.</p>

<p>Now, there was one lazy Beaver known
as Tired Tim who had nothing better to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
do than to go straight to Mr. Frog and
repeat what he heard.</p>

<p>To Tired Tim's surprise&mdash;for he had
expected Mr. Frog to lose his temper&mdash;to
his surprise that gentleman appeared
much amused by the bit of gossip. He
shook with silent laughter for a time,
quite as if he were saving his voice to
use that evening. And then he said:</p>

<p>"So your young friend thinks I'm not
in style, eh?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I'll tell you
something: he's right, in a way. And in
another way he isn't. The reason why
I'm not in style is because I always aim
to keep five years ahead of everybody
else.</p>

<p>"Five years from now and your neighbors
will all be wearing clothes like
mine."</p>

<p>"Can't we ever catch up with you?"
Tired Tim asked him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's only one way you can do
that," was Mr. Frog's mysterious answer.</p>

<p>And he would say no more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h3>CATCHING UP WITH MR. FROG</h3>


<p>Tired Tim Beaver asked Mr. Frog point-blank
how a person might catch up with
him in the matter of clothes.</p>

<p>"If you manage to dress in a style
that's five years ahead of the times, I
should like to know the way to be just as
fashionable," Tired Tim said.</p>

<p>But he got no help&mdash;then&mdash;from Mr.
Frog. All Ferdinand Frog would say
was that he'd be glad to oblige a friend,
but he couldn't&mdash;and wouldn't&mdash;be hurried.</p>

<p>And though the unhappy, eager Tim
teased and begged him to tell his secret,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Mr. Frog only smiled the more cheerfully
and said nothing.</p>

<p>It was maddening&mdash;for Tired Tim&mdash;though
Mr. Frog seemed to be enjoying
himself hugely. And the result was that
Tired Tim Beaver returned to the village
in the pond in a terrible state of
mind. Since he told everyone else what
he had learned about Ferdinand Frog
and his clothes, it was only a short time
before the whole Beaver family was so
stirred up that they couldn't do a stroke
of work. Ferdinand Frog was in everybody's
mouth, so to speak. And at last
old Grandaddy Beaver hit upon a plan.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get somebody to make
you a suit exactly like Mr. Frog's?" he
asked Tired Tim.</p>

<p>So Tired Tim took Grandaddy's advice.
That very night he disappeared,
to swagger back in a few days in a cos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>tume
that made him appear almost like
Mr. Frog's twin brother&mdash;if one didn't
look at his face. And there were some
among the villagers who even declared
that Tired Tim's mouth seemed wider
than it had been, and more like Mr.
Frog's.</p>

<p>When they asked Tired Tim if his
tailor hadn't stretched his mouth for him
he replied no, that he had been smiling
a good deal for a day or two, and perhaps
that was what made his mouth look
different.</p>

<p>Well, the whole Beaver village was delighted
with Tired Tim's new suit.</p>

<p>"Wait till Mr. Frog sees you!" people
cried. "He'll be <i>so</i> surprised!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/illus-2.jpg" width="275" height="400" alt="Mr. Frog Liked to Hear Himself Sing" title="Mr. Frog Liked to Hear Himself Sing" />
<span class="caption">Mr. Frog Liked to Hear Himself Sing</span>
</div>

<p>And somebody swam away in great
haste to find Mr. Frog and ask him to
come to the lower end of the pond, where
all the houses were. But when Ferdi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>nand
Frog arrived, everybody was disappointed,
and especially Tired Tim, who
had felt very proud in his gorgeous new
clothes. For he saw at once that Mr.
Frog was arrayed from head to foot in
an entirely new outfit. He looked almost
like a rainbow, so brilliant were the colors
of his costume.</p>

<p>At the same time Tired Tim put on as
brave a front as he could. And drawing
near to Mr. Frog, he said:</p>

<p>"What do you think of my new suit?"</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog looked at him as if he
hadn't noticed him before.</p>

<p>"Your suit's all right," he replied,
"for one who isn't particular. But it's
not far enough ahead of the times for me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I'd hate to be caught wearing it."</p>

<p>It was a bitter blow for Tired Tim
Beaver. In fact, he felt more tired than
ever; and he sank to the bottom of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
pond to rest, where his friends couldn't
see him.</p>

<p>As for the other members of the
Beaver family, they all went home with a
great longing inside them. There wasn't
a single one of them that wasn't eager to
wear clothes exactly as far ahead of the
times as were those of the elegant stranger,
Ferdinand Frog.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XI</h2>

<h3>FERDINAND FROG IS IN
NO HURRY</h3>


<p>Although everybody in the Beaver village
looked worried, Mr. Frog seemed to
be all the more cheerful. He knew well
enough that there was hardly one Beaver
in the pond that didn't wish and long for
clothes which were, like Mr. Frog's, five
years ahead of the times.</p>

<p>As day after day passed, not only were
the Beavers unable to do a single stroke
of work; they were so upset that they
could scarcely eat or sleep. And at last
the older villagers, such as Grandaddy
Beaver, began to see that something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
would have to be done. There was the
dam, which needed mending; and there
was the winter's food, which had to be
gathered.</p>

<p>So Grandaddy Beaver went to Ferdinand
Frog one day and told him that he
simply <i>must</i> come to the rescue of the
pond folk, and tell them how they might
have clothes as far ahead of the times
as were his own.</p>

<p>"Why?" Mr. Frog inquired. "What's
the trouble?"</p>

<p>"They can't work," Grandaddy Beaver
told him. "And there's the dam to be
fixed, and tree-tops to be cut and stored
for food, because winter's a-coming, and
there's no way we can stop it."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what you and your people
can do," Ferdinand Frog replied. "Just
bury yourselves in the mud during the
winter, as I do, and you'd have no use for
a dam, nor for food, either."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>But Grandaddy Beaver explained that
though such a plan might suit a Frog
exceedingly well, for a Beaver it would
never do at all.</p>

<p>"You have got us into this scrape,"
he told Mr. Frog, "so it's only fair that
you should help us out of it."</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog then did a number of
things, all of which were intended to let
Grandaddy Beaver see that what he
asked couldn't be done. Mr. Frog held
up his hands with the palms out and
rolled his eyes; he shut his great mouth
together as if he did not intend to say
another word. He looked so determined
that Grandaddy Beaver's heart sank.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;when Grandaddy Beaver
had almost given up all hope&mdash;then Mr.
Frog said suddenly:</p>

<p>"I'll consent to help you, because I
see that it's my duty."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" Grandaddy Beaver cried. "I
told people that I knew you'd come to
our rescue, for you have such a kind
face!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"And now, tell me!" he bade Ferdinand
Frog with great eagerness, while
he held a hand behind one of his ears,
in order to hear more clearly.</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog was not ready to give
away his secret.</p>

<p>He winked at Grandaddy Beaver, and
poked his fingers into the old gentleman's
ribs.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, my lad!" said Mr. Frog,
who was certainly many years younger
than Grandaddy Beaver. "I'm not prepared
to explain everything to you just
yet.</p>

<p>"You come to the big rock on the
other side of the pond as soon as it's
dark to-night; and bring with you every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>body
who wants to know how to get
clothes like mine.</p>

<p>"Now, do exactly as I say," Mr. Frog
cautioned Grandaddy, "and <i>everything
will be made easy</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XII</h2>

<h3>A BAD BLUNDER</h3>


<p>When it was almost dark Grandaddy
Beaver swam across the pond to the big
rock, where Ferdinand Frog had told
him to come.</p>

<p>And trooping after Daddy was almost
everybody in the village. Not counting
the women and children, there were eleven
of them. They climbed upon the rock,
looking for Mr. Frog. But he was nowhere
in sight.</p>

<p>"He'll be here in a minute or two,
probably," Grandaddy Beaver said hopefully,
for all he looked a bit anxious.</p>

<p>Then somebody spied a neat building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
near-by, which not one of them had noticed
before.</p>

<p>"What's this strange house?" people
asked one another. "Is this where Mr.
Frog lives?"</p>

<p>But nobody seemed to know the answer
to that question.</p>

<p>"It can't be a shop," Grandaddy decided,
"for there's no sign on it. And
nobody would have a shop without a
sign."</p>

<p>Now, the door of the little building
was shut and fastened. And the window-shades
were pulled carefully down. It
certainly looked as if nobody was at
home.</p>

<p>But suddenly there came a sound
that made the Beaver family jump. It
came from the house&mdash;there was no
doubt of that.</p>

<p>In fact it came right through the key<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>hole;
and it was like nothing in the
world but a sneeze.</p>

<p>A number of people were all ready to
jump into the water and swim away,
they were so startled.</p>

<p>And then a snicker followed the sneeze.
And by that time Grandaddy Beaver and
his friends guessed who was inside the
building. It was Ferdinand Frog; and
he had been watching his callers all the
time, through the keyhole, and listening
to everything that they said.</p>

<p>A few felt slightly uneasy, as they
tried to remember exactly what remarks
they had made about Mr. Frog himself.</p>

<p>"Come out!" they all cried, as soon as
they had recovered from their surprise.
"We want to see you!" And they formed
a half-circle in the dooryard.</p>

<p>Presently the door swung out, as if
somebody had pushed it open. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
there, on the <i>inside</i> of the open door,
which was flung back against the outside
of the building, they all saw a sign,
which said:</p>

<div class='center'>
MR. FERDINAND FROG<br />
<small>UNFASHIONABLE TAILOR</small><br />
<small>ALL THE STYLES</small><br />
<small>FIVE YEARS AHEAD</small><br />
<small>OF THE TIMES</small><br /></div>


<p>People began exclaiming that that was
just like Ferdinand Frog&mdash;who was an
odd fellow&mdash;to have his sign painted on
the inside of his door instead of on the
outside.</p>

<p>"It'll be all the style five years from
now," he retorted.</p>

<p>So that was Mr. Frog's secret! He
was a tailor himself! And there he was,
ready to make clothes for all of them!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>It was almost too good to be true. But
there he stood in the doorway, with a
tape around his neck, smiling and bowing.</p>

<p>"You'd better form in line!" he suggested.
"You can come in through the
front door. I'll measure you. And you
can pass out the back way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Don't
crowd, please!"</p>

<p>Now, that was just where Mr. Frog
made a great blunder. But he didn't
find it out till it was too late.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XIII</h2>

<h3>A SIXTY-INCH MEAL</h3>


<p>Mr. Frog's scheme of measuring the
Beaver family for new suits had just one
drawback; the Beaver family liked it too
well. So pleased were they over the
prospect of having "unfashionable"
clothes like Mr. Frog's at last that all
of them wanted to be measured not once
but several times. And each and every
one, as soon as Mr. Frog had taken his
measurements, went out through the
back door and slipped around the little
building, to wait again at the foot of the
line.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Frog was a spry worker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
He passed his tape around his customers
and jotted down figures on flat, black
stones as fast as he could make his
fingers fly. And if it hadn't been for just
one thing Ferdinand Frog would have
been quite happy. But beginning with
his first customer, he was somewhat
troubled; for in the whole company he
found not one who had brought his
pocket-book with him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" he asked Grandaddy
Beaver, when the old gentleman's
turn came. "Didn't you tell 'em what I
said about pocket-books?"</p>

<p>"I certainly did!" Grandaddy replied.
"I told them to be sure to leave their
pocket-books at home."</p>

<p>Mr. Frog gulped once or twice, as if
he were swallowing something unpleasant.
And he looked most surprised.</p>

<p>"Why, that's exactly wrong!" he cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that so?" Grandaddy Beaver quavered.
"Then I must have made a mistake.
You know I'm a <i>leetle</i> hard of
hearing."</p>

<p>"Never mind!" Ferdinand Frog answered,
for he always took his troubles
lightly. "Bring 'em when you come to
have your clothes fitted and it'll be all
right."</p>

<p>So he worked on. But by and by he
began to grow uneasy again. And now
and then he paused and went to the
window, where he peered somewhat anxiously
at the Beavers who waited before
his door in a long line.</p>

<p>"It's queer!" Mr. Frog exclaimed
aloud at last. "Here I've been measuring
'em for an hour and a half; and
there's just as many of 'em left.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I'll have to stop soon," he continued,
"for I'm going to a singing-party to-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>night.
And I don't want to be late."</p>

<p>His customers, however, wouldn't hear
of his leaving. The moment Mr. Frog's
remarks passed down the line, the Beaver
family began to jostle and push one another.
They crowded inside the tailor's
shop.</p>

<p>And to get rid of them, Mr. Frog
worked faster than ever. So great was
his haste that he measured everybody
wrong; whereas before he had measured
them correctly, while merely scratching
wrong figures upon the stones.</p>

<p>And finally he stopped suddenly. As
Grandaddy Beaver stepped forward to be
measured for the fourth time it dawned
upon Mr. Frog that he had measured him
several times already.</p>

<p>But Ferdinand Frog said nothing at
all.</p>

<p>Holding one end of his tape in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
mouth, he passed the other end around
Grandaddy's plump body.</p>

<p>All at once a cry of dismay came from
the customers who were looking on while
they waited.</p>

<p>"He's swallowing the tape!" they
cried, pointing to Mr. Frog.</p>

<p>It was true. Beneath their horrified
gaze the tape-measure disappeared little
by little inside Mr. Frog's mouth. And
before any of them could come to his
senses and seize the end of the yellow
strip, it had vanished from view completely.</p>

<p>Of course they saw that the tailor
could work no longer that evening. So
they filed sadly out of the shop.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" they asked Mr.
Frog, who was already locking his door.</p>

<p>"The tape stuck to my tongue," he
explained. "Everything does, you know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
But it doesn't matter, because I was
hungry. And now I feel better."</p>

<p>So Mr. Frog reached the singing-party
in time, after all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XIV</h2>

<h3>AN UNPLEASANT MIX-UP</h3>


<p>For a long time after he took the measurements
of the Beaver family Mr. Frog
kept carefully out of sight. Though several
of the Beavers visited his shop every
day, they always found the door locked
and the shades drawn. But from various
odd sounds&mdash;such as giggles and titters
and snickers&mdash;which they heard by listening
at the keyhole, they knew that the
tailor was inside.</p>

<p>To all their knocks and calls, however,
Mr. Frog made no other response. He
was working busily, and he did not want
to be interrupted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, to the delight of everybody, a
notice appeared one evening upon Mr.
Frog's door, which said:</p>

<div class='center'>
TO-MORROW WILL BE<br />
FITTING-DAY<br />
</div>

<p>Well, never was such excitement known
in the Beaver family&mdash;unless it was
when the great freshet came, and almost
washed away the dam. And it
was lucky there was no freshet upon Mr.
Frog's fitting-day, for there would have
been no one except the women and children
to do any work. Some of the young
dandies even spent the night right in
front of Mr. Frog's tailor's shop, in
order to be among the first to try on
their new clothes, which were to be five
years ahead of the times.</p>

<p>When Mr. Frog opened his door bright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and early the following morning he had
to beg his eager customers to keep order.</p>

<p>"There's a suit here for everybody,"
he announced. "But if you crowd into
my shop I may get the garments mixed.
And that would be terrible."</p>

<p>So the Beaver gentlemen were as quiet
and orderly as they could be. But as for
Mr. Frog himself, he jumped around as
if he were standing in a hot frying-pan.
He hustled his customers into their suits
in no time, assuring each one that his
garments fitted him perfectly, and asking
him please to step out through the back
door and wait.</p>

<p>By the time the last Beaver had on his
new clothes, and Mr. Frog followed him
into the back-yard, the tailor found that
there was a frightful uproar outside.
There wasn't one of the Beavers who
didn't claim that there was something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
wrong about his new clothes. But
whether sleeves, trousers or coat-tails
were too short or too long, or whether
they were too loose or too tight, Mr.
Frog declared that they were exactly as
they should be, because they were bound
to be in style in five years' time, and nobody&mdash;so
he said&mdash;could prove otherwise.</p>

<p>Of course, the Beaver family was far
from satisfied. Though they had what
they had been wishing for, they couldn't
help thinking that they looked very
queer&mdash;as, indeed, they did.</p>

<p>But Ferdinand Frog told the crowd
that it was only because they weren't
used to being dressed in that fashion.
He said he certainly was pleased with
their appearance and that he had never
seen any company that looked the least
bit like them.</p>

<p>There was one Beaver, however, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
shouted angrily that he knew his suit
wasn't fashionable and that he wouldn't
accept it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XV</h2>

<h3>EVERYONE IS HAPPY</h3>


<p>Mr. Frog led the angry Beaver around
to the front of his shop, while the others
followed, and pointed to his sign.</p>

<p>"There!" he said. "Don't you see that
I <i>claim</i> to be an unfashionable tailor?
You'll have to keep that suit, and pay me
for it, too. And so will everybody else."</p>

<p>But the whole Beaver family cried out
that they objected. "No one ever pays
his tailor," they told Mr. Frog. "It's
not the fashionable thing to do."</p>

<p>Even then Ferdinand Frog continued
to smile at them. He was such an agreeable
chap!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it's not fashionable now," he
admitted, "but it will be five years from
now. And since it's my way to collect
on delivery, I'll thank you to step up
one at a time and pay me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
please don't crowd!" he added.</p>

<p>There was really no need of that last
warning, because nobody made a move.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog, however, was not dismayed.
He leaped suddenly into the air and
alighted directly in front of a Beaver
known among his friends as Stingy
Steve&mdash;the very one to whom Mr. Frog
had just shown his sign.</p>

<p>"Pay up, please!" Ferdinand Frog
said.</p>

<p>"How much do I owe you?" the uneasy
Beaver asked him.</p>

<p>"Sixty!" Mr. Frog told him, with a
grin.</p>

<p>Stingy Steve thrust his hand inside the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
pocket of his new trousers, from which
he slowly drew one of Mr. Frog's tape-measures&mdash;of
which the tailor had at
least a dozen. Mr. Frog was always
tucking them away in odd places.</p>

<p>"Here!" Stingy Steve cried. "Here's
your pay&mdash;sixty inches, neither more nor
less!"</p>

<p>But Ferdinand Frog only laughed and
told him that he didn't mean <i>inches</i>.
That, he explained, was no pay at all.</p>

<p>"I know," Stingy Steve replied. "I
know it's not the fashionable way to pay
a bill at present. But it will be five years
from now. And what's more, you can't
prove that what I say isn't true."</p>

<p>For a few moments Mr. Frog stood
there gasping. And pretty soon he noticed
that his customers were all busily
picking up chips and sticks and pebbles.
At first he thought they were going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
throw them at him; and he was all ready
to jump.</p>

<p>But he soon found that he was mistaken.</p>

<p>"Here! Here's your pay, Mr. Frog!"
they began to cry. And to their astonishment
Mr. Frog began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I don't want any pay," he declared.
"Will you all promise to wear your new
clothes if I make them free?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! Yes!" sounded on all sides.</p>

<p>"Then it's a bargain!" Ferdinand
Frog shouted. And he leaped into the
air and kicked his heels together three
times.</p>

<p>After that he turned a back somersault,
and then he rolled over and over
until he landed with a great splash in
the pond.</p>

<p>Deep down on the muddy bottom Mr.
Frog laughed as if he could never stop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
The Beavers on the bank could neither
see nor hear him. And he knew there
was no danger of their thinking him impolite,
especially when he said:</p>

<p>"They don't even know that I've
played a trick on them! And what a
terrible sight they are! I've never seen
any company that looked the least bit
like them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<h3>STOP THAT!</h3>


<p>On a cool summer's morning Ferdinand
Frog was sitting among the reeds near
the bank of the pond when a harsh voice
suddenly said:</p>

<p>"Stop that!"</p>

<p>Looking up, Mr. Frog saw a huge bird
standing on one leg in the water, watching
him. The stranger was actually so
big that Mr. Frog hadn't noticed him.</p>

<p>To be sure, he had seen what he
thought was a stick stuck upright in the
muddy bottom of the pond. That was
really the stranger's leg; but Mr. Frog
hadn't taken the trouble to glance up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>wards
and see what was at the top of it.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. Frog was frightened as
soon as he discovered his mistake, for
the bird had a great, long bill. Without
being told, Ferdinand Frog knew that
that bill could open like a trap&mdash;and
seize him, too. But he showed not the
least sign that he was even disturbed.</p>

<p>"Stop that, I say!" the stranger repeated,
before Mr. Frog had so much as
said a word.</p>

<p>"Stop what?" Mr. Frog asked.</p>

<p>"Stop sticking your tongue out at
me!" the other commanded.</p>

<p>In spite of his alarm, when he heard
that Ferdinand Frog began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "but I
think you are mistaken. I wasn't sticking
my tongue out at you. I was only
catching flies." Mr. Frog paid no attention
to the sneering laugh that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
stranger gave. "You see," he went on,
"I'm having my breakfast. And this is
how I manage it: I wait here without
moving until a fly comes my way. Then
I dart my tongue at him as quick as
lightning.</p>

<p>"My tongue," Mr. Frog explained, "is
fastened at the front of my mouth instead
of at the back. So I can often
reach a fly when he thinks he's perfectly
safe. And furthermore, my tongue is so
sticky that if it touches a fly, he can't
get away. Then I swallow that one and
wait for another."</p>

<p>"A likely story!" the big bird scoffed.
"I've been watching you for a long time
(Mr. Frog shivered when he heard that!)
and I know what I'm talking about.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There you go again!" he shrieked angrily,
as Ferdinand Frog's tongue flew out
and captured another fly so quickly that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the stranger couldn't see just what had
happened.</p>

<p>"Listen to me a moment!" Mr. Frog
said. "Like most people, I have to eat.
And when I eat I can't help sticking out
my tongue. So I'd suggest that if you
don't care to watch me at my breakfast
you'd better go away. It certainly isn't
my fault that you're standing right in
front of me."</p>

<span class="caption">Grand-daddy Beaver Appeals to Mr. Frog</span>
</div>
<p>But the stranger declined to move.</p>

<p>"If you really meant to be polite," he
grumbled, "you'd at least turn your back
when you stick out your tongue."</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog never stirred. He was
afraid that the moment he turned his
back the big bird would pounce upon him.</p>

<p>"It's not necessary for me to turn
around now," he explained. "I've finished
my breakfast. And I hope you've
had yours, too."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry to say that I have," the
stranger answered with a sigh, as he
looked longingly at plump Mr. Frog. "I
couldn't eat another mouthful if it sat
right in front of me."</p>

<p>And then Ferdinand Frog felt as if a
great weight had been lifted from his
mind. He smiled all over his face, to
show the stranger that he was glad to see
him.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Mr. Frog cried. "Then we can
have a friendly chat together. I always
like to talk with travellers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What a
long, sharp bill you have!"</p>

<p>Now, some people would think that a
rude remark. But it seemed to please
the stranger immensely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XVII</h2>

<h3>A LONG, SHARP BILL</h3>


<p>Certainly it was an odd remark that
Ferdinand Frog made about the stranger's
wicked-looking bill. But knowing
that its owner had eaten until he had no
appetite left for the time being, Mr. Frog
forgot his fear. And he couldn't help
being curious about the big bird, because
he had never seen another like him.</p>

<p>Of course, what Mr. Frog said would
have annoyed some people a good deal,
for he had just the same as told the
stranger that he had <i>a long, sharp nose</i>.
But luckily it happened that the newcomer
was very vain both of the length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the sharpness of his bill. So he liked
Mr. Frog's comment. And he promptly
forgot his displeasure over Mr. Frog's
tongue.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he said, in response to Ferdinand
Frog's speech, "there isn't another
bill like mine for twenty miles around&mdash;except
my wife's."</p>

<p>"You don't live in this neighborhood,
do you?" Mr. Frog inquired.</p>

<p>"My home is beyond the Second Mountain,"
the stranger informed him.</p>

<p>And Ferdinand Frog was glad to hear
that the huge fellow dwelt no nearer.</p>

<p>"What's your name, friend?" Mr.
Frog then asked.</p>

<p>"My name&mdash;&mdash;" the giant bird replied&mdash;"my
name is G. B. Heron."</p>

<p>"'G. B.'!" Mr. Frog exclaimed, turning
a pale green color. "What do those
letters stand for? Not Grizzly Bear, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hope!" He had heard of&mdash;but had never
seen&mdash;a Grizzly Bear; and for a moment
he thought that perhaps he had met one
at last.</p>

<p>But the stranger soon set his fresh
fears at rest.</p>

<p>"My full name," he told Mr. Frog, "is
Great Blue Heron. But plain Mr. Heron
will do, when you address me."</p>

<p>"I hope I'll see you sooner the next
time we meet," Mr. Frog said. And he
resolved that he would keep a sharp eye
out for Mr. Heron, so that he might have
plenty of time to hide the moment he
caught sight of him.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt that we'll meet
again," Mr. Heron replied. "I expect
to come here to live. And I flew over
here to-day to look about a bit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Are
there many in your family?"</p>

<p>"No!" Mr. Frog hastened to answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
"There's only myself living in this
pond."</p>

<p>"But you must have plenty of relations
somewhere," Mr. G. B. Heron insisted.
"If I came here to live, and anything
happened to you, I'd want to tell
your family."</p>

<p>"Well, I have a few relations, to be
sure," Mr. Frog admitted. "But they
don't amount to much. They're a stringy
lot, I can tell you."</p>

<p>Mr. Heron looked at him as if he
couldn't quite believe that statement.</p>

<p>"That's odd," he observed. "Now,
you're nice and plump."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm <i>too</i> fat," Ferdinand Frog
said. "Aunt Polly Woodchuck tells me
that if I get much fatter I'll lose my
good looks."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with her," said Mr.
Heron. "You look good to me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>And now it was Mr. Frog's turn to be
pleased; for he was very vain.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it!" he cried. "And
I'll tell you a secret: I've always been
quite satisfied with myself until my eyes
fell on you. Oh! if I only had such a
bill as yours!"</p>

<p>"You like my bill, then?" Mr. Heron
asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Ferdinand Frog answered.
"And it must be very handy, too."</p>

<p>"What for?" Mr. Heron inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, for making button-holes!" Ferdinand
Frog exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XVIII</h2>

<h3>MAKING BUTTON-HOLES</h3>


<p>Mr. Heron couldn't help being interested.</p>

<p>"Button-holes in what?" he asked
Ferdinand Frog.</p>

<p>"Why, in suits of clothes, of course!"
the tailor answered. "If you had a
tailor's shop, as I have, you'd find that
bill of yours a handy thing to have.
When you wanted to make a button-hole
in a piece of cloth all you'd need do
would be to stick your bill through it."</p>

<p>"I'd like to try that," Mr. Heron remarked.</p>

<p>"Then come right over to my shop,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Mr. Frog urged him. "I'll let you make
all the button-holes you want."</p>

<p>"Very well!" Mr. Heron agreed. "I'll
make button-holes until I get hungry."</p>

<p>"That's a good idea!" Mr. Frog cried.
And his new friend smiled, for he
thought the tailor must be very stupid.
He intended to stay with Mr. Frog until
he was hungry enough to eat him. And
no one who wasn't dull-witted could have
failed to grasp his plan.</p>

<p>Well, they started off together; and
they arrived shortly afterward at the
tailor's shop.</p>

<p>Observing that Mr. Heron was altogether
too big to squeeze inside the tiny
building, Mr. Frog entered it, to reappear
soon with an armful of cloth.</p>

<p>On this Mr. Frog proceeded to mark
a row of dots. And then he hung the
cloth upon some reeds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"There!" he announced. "Can you
hit the mark?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I can," Mr. Heron replied.
And quick as lightning his sharp bill
darted out and made a neat hole exactly
where every dot had been.</p>

<p>"Splendid! Perfect!" Mr. Frog exclaimed.
And thereupon he brought
forth more cloth.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time Mr. Heron
had made eighty-seven button-holes. But
Mr. Frog noticed that beginning with
the seventy-seventh button-hole the
stranger's aim began to fail. He did not
hit the dots quite squarely. And he
seemed not to have his mind on his work.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Frog inquired.
"Are you getting tired?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not tired," Mr. Heron told him.</p>

<p>"Are your eyes troubling you?" the
tailor asked him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;I can see well enough," Mr.
Heron replied. "But I'm beginning to
feel a bit faint. And I think I've made
enough button-holes for one day."</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog said that he had a special
suit which he was making for somebody.
And he begged Mr. Heron to
make the button-holes in that too.</p>

<p>Mr. Heron frowned. But presently he
yielded, telling Mr. Frog to hurry, for
he had another matter to attend to.</p>

<p>So the tailor leaped into his shop once
more. And for a few moments he was
very busy, arranging another strip of
cloth so that the stranger might make
button-holes in it.</p>

<p>When all was ready Mr. Heron stepped
up to do his work. He was just about
to strike, when he suddenly paused.</p>

<p>"Who's going to have this suit?" he
asked the tailor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Fish Hawk," said the tailor.
"Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"I should say I did!" Mr. Heron cried.
"And he's no friend of mine, I assure
you. I only wish he was behind this
cloth! I'd run my bill clean through
him!"</p>

<p>A cold, cruel glitter came into Mr. Heron's
eyes. And when he struck, he struck
with all his power, as if he were driving
his wicked bill through Mr. Fish Hawk
that very moment.</p>

<p>He made only that one thrust. And he
did not withdraw his bill, either. Instead
he set up a terrible squawking and began
to flounder about on the bank of the pond.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" he cried in a muffled
voice.</p>

<p>But Ferdinand Frog only smiled&mdash;and
made no move to assist his new acquaintance.
The truth of the matter was that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he had hidden a block of wood behind
the cloth, and Mr. Heron had driven
his bill into it so far that he couldn't
pull it out.</p>

<p>With a loud chuckle Mr. Frog jumped
into the water and swam away. And
that very day he moved to Black Creek,
without troubling himself to learn how
Mr. Heron got himself out of his difficulty.</p>

<p>But the tailor couldn't help thinking
what a handy thing it would be to have
a bill like Mr. Heron's.</p>

<p>"He can even make button-holes in
wood!" Mr. Frog exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2>XIX</h2>

<h3>THE SWIMMING TEACHER</h3>


<p>It surprised the wild folk in Pleasant
Valley when they learned that Mr. Frog
had forsaken the Beaver pond for a new
home on the bank of Black Creek.</p>

<p>When his friends asked him why he
had moved Mr. Frog told them he had
made up his mind that the pond was too
damp for the good of his health. Besides,
Black Creek was nearer Cedar
Swamp, where the Frog family held their
singing-parties.</p>

<p>Of course, the real reason for Ferdinand
Frog's change of scene was that
he was afraid Mr. Heron might return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to the Beaver pond some day, to look for
him.</p>

<p>And when that happened, Mr. Frog did
not care to be there.</p>

<p>In his new home, however, he felt quite
at his ease. And he set out at once to
make himself agreeable to his neighbors.</p>

<p>The nearest of these were Long Bill
Wren and his wife, who at that time
chanced to have a family of five growing
children.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog took a great interest in the
youngsters, who were already big enough
to leave their ball-shaped home, which
hung among the reeds, and hop about on
the bank of the creek&mdash;and even fly a
bit now and then.</p>

<p>Quite often Mr. Frog stopped to look
at Long Bill's children and tell their
parents how handsome they were.</p>

<p>"I suppose&mdash;" he said to their fath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>er
one day&mdash;&mdash;"I suppose you are going
to teach them to swim?"</p>

<p>Long Bill Wren hadn't thought of that.
And he said quickly that he was afraid
it wouldn't be safe.</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog replied that it certainly
wouldn't be safe not to, living as they
did so close to the water.</p>

<p>"They're liable to tumble in almost
any day," he said. "I suppose you can
swim, yourself?"</p>

<p>"No!" Long Bill answered, looking
somewhat worried. "I've never learned
how."</p>

<p>Mr. Frog appeared greatly surprised
by his neighbor's reply.</p>

<p>"Then I'd be glad to teach your children,"
he offered.</p>

<p>"Swimming is a very simple matter.
And when you're young is the time to
learn. I began when I was a tadpole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
And knowing how to swim has saved my
life a good many times."</p>

<p>Naturally the children were eager to
have a lesson at once. And Long Bill
Wren was about to yield to their teasing,
when his wife happened to come flying
home.</p>

<p>"What's going on here?" she asked
sharply, for she saw that something unusual
was afoot.</p>

<p>And when her husband explained Mr.
Frog had kindly offered to teach the
children to swim she cried, "The idea!
I won't have it!"</p>

<p>Long Bill Wren looked uncomfortable.
He was afraid his wife had hurt Mr.
Frog's feelings.</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog smiled and bowed politely
to Mrs. Wren.</p>

<p>"Surely you're not afraid your children
will drown in my care?" he cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" she told him. "The trouble is
I'd be nervous, because one of my young
brothers was eaten by a member of your
family."</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog's face fell. But not
for long.</p>

<p>"I don't see how that could have come
about," he declared. "It must have been
an accident."</p>

<p>"Perhaps!" Long Bill's wife replied.
"Anyhow, I want no such accidents to
happen to my children." And she looked
sternly at her new neighbor.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog glanced away uneasily.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," he observed, "you do not
trust me. But I assure you I had no
idea of eating any of your little ones.
They'd be perfectly safe with me. Why,
every one of them is so plump I'd never
be able to decide which one to choose
first!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>He often wondered, afterward, why
Mrs. Wren promptly called all her children
into the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>DISTURBING THE NEIGHBORS</h3>


<p>It was no wonder that Long Bill Wren's
wife did not care for Ferdinand Frog,
after his blundering remark about her
children.</p>

<p>Though her husband often told her that
Mr. Frog must have been merely joking,
she insisted that he was not a safe person
to have in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"That Mr. Frog certainly is a queer
one," she said to her husband one day.
"I was watching him this morning. And
what do you suppose I saw him do?"
Mrs. Wren did not wait for Long Bill
to answer her question. "Mr. Frog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
actually pulled off his own skin!" she
cackled nervously.</p>

<p>"Cat-tails and pussy-willows!" Long
Bill Wren exclaimed&mdash;which was his way
of showing he was surprised. "Mr. Frog
must be ill. Maybe I ought to go and
tell Aunt Polly Woodchuck, the herb-doctor,
and ask her to come over here
at once."</p>

<p>His wife, however, shook her head.</p>

<p>"He can't be ill," she said.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"His appetite is still good," she explained.
"I saw Mr. Frog swallow his
skin after he had pulled it off. And
it didn't seem to disagree with him. He
went in swimming right afterwards."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Long Bill exclaimed. "That's
a very dangerous thing to do. At least,
I've often heard Johnnie Green say that
a boy ought not to go in the water soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>er
than a full hour after he has had a
meal."</p>

<p>"There he is now!" Mrs. Wren cried
abruptly. "There's Mr. Frog!"</p>

<p>Peeping out of the doorway on one side
of his ball-shaped house, Long Bill could
see Ferdinand Frog paddling about in
Black Creek.</p>

<p>While they were watching him, he sank
before their eyes. And after a time they
couldn't help feeling uneasy, because
their odd neighbor did not show himself
again.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;" Long Bill whispered
at last&mdash;&mdash;"I'm afraid he was taken with
a cramp, for that's what you get by swimming
too soon after a meal&mdash;so Johnnie
Green says.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I'm glad now that we
didn't let Mr. Frog teach our children
to swim, because it's easy to see that he's
a careless fellow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>So worried were Long Bill and his
wife over Mr. Frog's disappearance that
they hurried out and told all their neighbors
about it. And soon a crowd had gathered
upon the bank of the creek, to watch
the spot where Mr. Frog had vanished.</p>

<p>They stayed there for a long time. But
to their great alarm, their missing friend
did not reappear.</p>

<p>"I hope he's safe," old Mr. Turtle
piped in his thin, quavering voice. "He's
making a new suit for me; and I'd hate
to have anything happen to him."</p>

<p>"What's this&mdash;a party?" a voice called
suddenly from under the bank. And then
Mr. Frog himself, looking fine and fit,
hopped up and stood before the company,
with a broad grin on his face.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" they shouted.
"We were worried about you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been having a mud bath at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the bottom of the creek," Mr. Frog told
them. "Mud baths, you know, are very
healthful. And I advise you all to try
one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XXI</h2>

<h3>MUD BATHS</h3>


<p>Though Mr. Frog agreed cheerfully to
show his neighbors how to take a mud
bath, there wasn't even one of them that
accepted his offer.</p>

<p>To be sure, old Mr. Turtle remarked
that there was a good deal to be said
about mud baths. And then he waddled
to the water's edge and swam away.</p>

<p>"You heard what he said," Mr. Frog
continued, turning to those who were
left. "It's simple enough. All one has to
do is to dive down to the bottom of the
creek and bury himself snugly in the
soft mud."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"How do you breathe?" somebody inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's simple enough," Mr. Frog
replied. "You breathe through your
skin."</p>

<p>Smiles appeared on the faces of his
listeners. And here and there a cough
sounded. It was plain that the company
had little faith in Mr. Frog's easy explanation.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it hurt your skin to breathe
through it?" some one else asked.</p>

<p>"What if it does?" Ferdinand Frog
retorted. "When your skin becomes
worn, pull it off!"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed heartily at his answer;
or at least, everybody except Long
Bill Wren and his wife. They exchanged
a thoughtful look. For they knew Mr.
Frog's ways better than his other neighbors
did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, Ferdinand Frog did not mind the
laughter at all.</p>

<p>"Of course," he went on, "you can't
breathe through your skin quite so well
as you can in the <i>regular</i> way. After
you have stayed in the mud a while,
you'll begin to want a <i>regular</i> breath of
fresh air. So then you come up to the
top of the water."</p>

<p>"Cat-tails and pussy-willows!" Long
Bill Wren cried out. "I'm sure I shall
never take a mud bath. They seem
to me to be very dangerous."</p>

<p>"Not at all!" Mr. Frog assured him.
"They're as safe as standing on your
head." And thereupon he stood on his
own head, to prove that what he said was
true.</p>

<p>Still the company was not moved to
take Mr. Frog's advice and try a mud
bath. Most of them declared that noth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>ing
could induce them to undertake such
a risky act. But a few daring ones said
that if all the rest would take mud baths,
and if they found that they liked them,
they themselves would be willing to test
them too.</p>

<p>However, nobody took a single step
towards the creek. So at last the company
scattered, leaving Long Bill Wren
and Mr. Frog alone upon the bank.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Long Bill had been thinking
deeply. He had begun to wonder
whether there might not be some good
in a mud bath, in spite of his neighbors'
doubts. And now he turned to Ferdinand
Frog and began speaking in a hushed
voice.</p>

<p>"Don't tell my wife I asked you this
question," he said; "but I should like to
know if mud baths are good for rheumatism."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good for it!" Mr. Frog exclaimed.
"Why, they're a sure cure&mdash;and the only
one!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h3>LEARNING TO HOLD HIS BREATH</h3>


<p>There on the bank of Black Creek Mr.
Frog and Long Bill Wren talked in
whispers about mud baths. And in a
short time Long Bill announced that he
had made up his mind to try one.</p>

<p>"Good!" Mr. Frog cried, as he patted
his neighbor on the back. "And now
let me give you a bit of advice. Before
you dive into the creek you should learn
<i>to hold your breath</i>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"You'd better go home and begin practising
at once."</p>

<p>So Long Bill Wren flew into his house
and stayed there the rest of that day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
But he soon found that all was not as
simple as he had hoped. Whenever he
was trying to hold his breath his wife
was sure to ask him a question. And
of course that led to trouble. If he
didn't answer her she thought him rude&mdash;and
said so, quite frankly, too. While
if he did answer her, speaking spoiled
his practice.</p>

<p>It was annoying, to say the least. And
by the next morning the poor fellow was
almost frantic.</p>

<p>He sought out Mr. Frog and explained
how hard it was for him to learn to hold
his breath.</p>

<p>"If you could only think of some way
of making my wife hold hers too!" Long
Bill moaned.</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog said at once that nobody
could do that, and there was no use in
trying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you," he asked, "go off
by yourself in Cedar Swamp, and practice
there?"</p>

<p>But Long Bill said that he ought not
to stay away from home long enough
to do that.</p>

<p>"Then there's only one way left for
you," Mr. Frog decided. "You must
practice at night, when your wife's
asleep."</p>

<p>"A good idea!" Long Bill whispered.
"I'll try it this very night!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Bright and early the next morning
Long Bill Wren found Mr. Frog a little
way up the creek and told him that his
night's practice had been a great success.</p>

<p>"I began holding my breath right after
sunset," he said, "and it was so easy
that I fell asleep. And I never breathed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
once all night long, until I awoke at day-break."</p>

<p>The news delighted Mr. Frog.</p>

<p>"Good!" he cried. "And now there's
one more thing you must do before you
take a mud bath. You must learn to
breathe through your skin.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Just
try right now," he urged his companion.</p>

<p>So Long Bill tried to breathe through
his skin, while holding his breath at the
same time.</p>

<p>And soon he began to sputter and
choke.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't do it," he faltered
at last.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog looked somewhat glum&mdash;for
a moment.</p>

<p>He pondered in silence. And at length
he declared that without doubt there
must be something wrong with Long
Bill's skin!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"How long have you worn it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"All my life!" Long Bill told him.</p>

<p>"That's it!" Mr. Frog exclaimed.
"It's worn out. You'll have to pull it
off and use a fresh one."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XXIII</h2>

<h3>MR. FROG RUNS AWAY</h3>


<p>It may have been Mr. Frog's words that
dismayed Long Bill Wren, or it may
have been his manner&mdash;or perhaps both.
Anyhow, Long Bill looked frightened.</p>

<p>"Where can I get a fresh skin if I
pull off the one I'm wearing?" he wanted
to know.</p>

<p>"Why, there's another skin just beneath
your old one," Mr. Frog informed
him glibly. "Just pull hard and you'll
see that I know what I'm talking about."</p>

<p>But Long Bill was puzzled.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know where to begin," he
stammered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe you need help," Mr. Frog
suggested.</p>

<p>And Long Bill agreed that he did
need help&mdash;and a good deal of it, too.</p>

<p>"Well," Mr. Frog said with a giggle,
"I'll get old Mr. Turtle to assist me.
And between us we'll have your old skin
off before you know it."</p>

<p>He began to bellow Mr. Turtle's name
at the top of his lungs. And soon the
old gentleman's black head popped out
of the water. And presently Mr. Turtle
waddled up the bank of Black Creek and
listened to Ferdinand Frog's directions.</p>

<p>"You take hold of Long Bill's tail,"
Mr. Frog ordered him, while to the
frightened owner of the tail he said
cheerfully, "Anything Mr. Turtle takes
hold of just <i>has</i> to come. He never lets
go until it does."</p>

<p>Now, Long Bill Wren had suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
made up his mind that he wouldn't take
a mud bath, after all. He didn't like
the prospect of having his skin pulled
off. Suppose Mr. Frog should be mistaken
about that second skin, which the
tailor claimed lay underneath the old
one?</p>

<p>Long Bill believed that with no skin
at all he would find his rheumatism much
worse than before. And he would certainly
be a queer-looking object.</p>

<p>So as old Mr. Turtle crawled slowly
towards him, he drew away.</p>

<p>"I'm going to wait&mdash;&mdash;" Long Bill
announced.</p>

<p>"Why?" Mr. Frog demanded.</p>

<p>"Going to wait till the weather is
warmer," Long Bill faltered.</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Frog was disappointed
by having his plans so upset.</p>

<p>And Mr. Turtle was disappointed too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"My mouth is open," he told Mr. Frog.
"I must grab something. And it might
as well be you."</p>

<p>But Mr. Frog jumped nimbly out of
Mr. Turtle's reach. And a moment later
he thrust the free end of a tree-root between
Mr. Turtle's jaws.</p>

<p>They closed with a snap. And Mr.
Turtle began to pull.</p>

<p>"Come on!" Mr. Frog urged Long
Bill Wren. "The tree may fall at any
moment. It's safer elsewhere." And
without waiting to see what happened,
he leaped into Black Creek and swam
away.</p>

<p>As for Long Bill Wren, he hurried
home. He knew his wife would be wondering
where he was, for he had been
away from the house in the reeds much
longer than his usual ten minutes.</p>

<p>Arriving there, he was not surprised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that she asked him a few questions. And
he explained to her that he had been on
the bank of the creek, watching old Mr.
Turtle pulling at the root of a willow.</p>

<p>"And I can tell you that I'm well
pleased that it wasn't my tail Mr. Turtle
had in his jaws," he said solemnly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wren shuddered at the mere mention
of such an unlucky accident. And
then she said: "I hope that dangerous
Mr. Frog was not with you."</p>

<p>"I believe he was there for a time,"
her husband replied. "But he left before
I did."</p>

<p>"I wish you would keep away from
him," she remarked.</p>

<p>"I'm going to," Long Bill Wren promised.
"Although Mr. Frog is our newest
neighbor, I shall have nothing more to
do with him."</p>

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
