5</span>GRIMMER AND KAMPER</h2>
<p>Grimmer walks upon the floor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well can Grimmer wield his sword:<br />
&ldquo;Give to me fair Ingeborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sake of Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far too little art thou, lad,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou about thee canst not hack;<br />
When thou comest &rsquo;mong other kemps,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever do they drive thee back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so little, Sire, am I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I myself full well can guard;<br />
When I fight with kempions I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gallantly can ply my sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>&ldquo;Kamper dwells in Birting&rsquo;s land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a stalwart kemp he&rsquo;s known;<br />
Thou shalt wed my daughter, if<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou to earth canst hew him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rage and grief his bosom filled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grimmer through the door retires:<br />
&ldquo;What answer did my father give?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beauteous Ingeborg inquires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kamper dwells in Birting&rsquo;s land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he bears a warlike name;<br />
If I him to death can smite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I may thee with honour claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Answered him the fair young maid:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! my father seeks thy death,<br />
Kamper for thee is far too strong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He will work thee rueful scathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll lend a helm to thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou may&rsquo;st trust upon in fight;<br />
And an acton I&rsquo;ll provide,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon no sword will bite.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give thee a faulchion good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a harness on to put;<br />
On earth&rsquo;s ground no sword is found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through that harness which can cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give to thee a sword<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In thy youthful hand to bear;<br />
Thou therewith mayst iron cleave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en as though it water were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kamper stands on Birtingsborough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thence so far he sees and wide:<br />
&ldquo;What can be that little wreck<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitherward that seems to glide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was little Grimmer bold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Steered his vessel straight to land;<br />
&rsquo;Twas the bulky Kamper then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tow&rsquo;rds him stretched a friendly hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, little Grimmer, be!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here no harm thou hast to fear;<br />
Half my land I&rsquo;ll give to thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my sister&rsquo;s daughter dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er will I that Ingeborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My beloved, should hear such shame,<br />
That I thy sister&rsquo;s daughter took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy friend that I became.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll go to Vimming&rsquo;s hill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And do battle, as is fit;<br />
One of us his life shall lose,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere the ring of death we quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereto answered Kamper bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He had such an eager hand:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll the first blow have, forsooth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis on my own earth we stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first blow big Kamper struck,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Given &rsquo;twas with wrathful yell;<br />
He so hard has Grimmer struck,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down to earth young Grimmer fell.</p>
<p>Upstood little Grimmer then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly little Grimmer rose:<br />
&ldquo;Thou shalt also stand me one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ere the sun sinks to repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>The next blow was Glimmer&rsquo;s own,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fierce he hewed with his right hand;<br />
He hewed on Kamper&rsquo;s golden helm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his heart down went the brand.</p>
<p>Kamper bellowed as he fell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead upon the earth so hard:<br />
&ldquo;Would to God that of my case<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Knew my brother Rodengard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyous little Grimmer was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the fight to end had come;<br />
Gold and silver much he took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the maid he bore it home.</p>
<p>Blood forth streaming from his wound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies the mighty Kamper dead;<br />
Grimmer lives, the brave young swain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Carries off his gold so red.</p>
<p>When he had the victory won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Little space he tarried there;<br />
Joyous sailed his men away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Joyous with their booty fair.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Standing on the battlement,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks the Damsel towards the strand:<br />
&ldquo;Yonder I my youth espy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; See his vessel touch the strand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to brave young Grimmer be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For his faith he kept so well;<br />
On next Monday morn, at dawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grimmer&rsquo;s bridal feast befell.</p>

11</span>MIMMERING TAN</h2>
<p>The smallest man was Mimmering<br />
E&rsquo;er born in the land of Carl the King.</p>
<p>And ere he into the world was brought<br />
His clothes already were for him wrought.</p>
<p>Ere yet he could walk across the floor,<br />
A ponderous iron cuirass he bore.</p>
<p>And ere he had learnt to ride, to ride,<br />
His father&rsquo;s sword to his hip he tied.</p>
<p>The first time he his sword could bear<br />
A better knight breathed not the air.</p>
<p>So down he went to the salt sea strand,<br />
As the merchants lay before the land.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>He saw then, under the steep hill&rsquo;s side,<br />
A knight with sheeny armour ride.</p>
<p>Coursing came he at headlong speed,<br />
Grim as a lion was his steed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gallant Sir Knight, to me attend,<br />
Wilt let me with thee as a shield boy wend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art too little and young, I fear,<br />
My heavy harness thou canst not bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that word Mimmering wrathful grew,<br />
The Knight from his steed to earth he threw.</p>
<p>And much more harm to him was done,<br />
He smote his head against a stone.</p>
<p>He clomb on the saddle and rode away,<br />
He&rsquo;ll fain with other knights have a fray.</p>
<p>And when to the green wood he had won,<br />
There met he Vidrik Verlandson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well met, well met, thou stalwart knight,<br />
Say, wilt thou for a fair maid fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Then straightway Vidrik made reply:<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet thee, dwarf, or no man am I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They fought for a day, they fought for twain,<br />
Neither could from the other the victory gain.</p>
<p>So good stall-brothership vowed have they,<br />
Which should endure to the judgment day.</p>
<p>How should it endure that long time all?<br />
It could not last till evening-fall.</p>

14</span>THE END OF SIVARD SNARENSWAYNE</h2>
<p>Young Sivard he his step-sire slew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To avenge his mother&rsquo;s wrongs;<br />
And now to sport in the Monarch&rsquo;s court<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Young Sivard sorely longs.</p>
<p>It was Sivard Snarenswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his mother&rsquo;s presence strode:<br />
&ldquo;Say, shall I ride from hence?&rdquo; he cried,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Or wend on foot my road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O never shalt thou go on foot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst I&rsquo;ve a horse in stall;<br />
I&rsquo;ll give thee the steed of matchless breed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which courtiers Grayman call.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>They led Grayman out of the stall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His reins were gilt about;<br />
His eyes were bright as the clear star-light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fire from his bit sprang out.</p>
<p>Off Sivard throws his gloves, like snows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The stripling&rsquo;s hands appeared;<br />
And with all his force he girded the horse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For to trust the groom he feared.</p>
<p>It was Sivard&rsquo;s mother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In a kirtle red was clad:<br />
&ldquo;The horse I fear will cost thee dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that fear makes me sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She followed him a long, long way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart was filled with woe:<br />
&ldquo;O take good heed of the Grayman steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He many a trick doth know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now list to me, my mother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quick cast your care aside;<br />
To a son of worth thou hast given birth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who his horse full well can ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Away they go, o&rsquo;er bridges now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And now o&rsquo;er brooks in flood;<br />
Clung so tight to his steed the knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That his boots were filled with blood.</p>
<p>The horse he hurried o&rsquo;er the wold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Right past the crowded Ting;<br />
Then wildly gazed the folk, amazed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the horse he could so spring.</p>
<p>For fifteen nights and for fifteen days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The speed of their race endured;<br />
Before them tall uprose a hall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the gates all fast secured.</p>
<p>The Dane King stood on the battlement,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thence looked far and wide:<br />
&ldquo;Some drunken peer is coming here,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who his horse full well can ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O that is either a drunken peer,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On courser good and keen;<br />
Or that, I swear, is my sister&rsquo;s heir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in battle he has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>The horse did spit from his mouth the bit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, neighing, bounded high;<br />
Then maids and dames forsook their games<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trembled fearfully.</p>
<p>Then maids and dames forsook their games,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shook their weeds below;<br />
To meet the boy, his sister&rsquo;s joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The King of the Danes did go.</p>
<p>It was the mighty King of the Danes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus the King he cried:<br />
&ldquo;Ye archers, straight undo the gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fling it open wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sivard Snarenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the portal in rode he;<br />
Then dames fifteen of beauteous mien<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before him bent their knee.</p>
<p>The Dane King to his merry men spake:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I rede ye treat him fair;<br />
I tell to ye for a verity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No jesting he will bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>It was Sivard Snarenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He made his courser bound<br />
Ten ells and more the ramparts o&rsquo;er,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thus his death he found.</p>
<p>From his gilded selle down Sivard fell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Snapped Grayman&rsquo;s back outright;<br />
Wept great and small in the Monarch&rsquo;s hall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the wizard steed and knight.</p>
<h2><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>SIR GUNCELIN&rsquo;S WEDDING</h2>
<p>It was the Count Sir Guncelin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who to his mother cried:<br />
&ldquo;O I in quest of knightly fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through foreign lands will ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if thou from the land wilt ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To help thee on thy way,<br />
I give thee the steed, the wondrous steed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The good steed Carl the grey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give the steed for thy time of need,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The good grey Carl, but know<br />
No spur of steel must grace thy heel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor helm be on thy brow.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Never a warrior must thou heed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But straight thy path pursue,<br />
Till thou in fight engage the knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose name is Ivor Blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Count Sir Guncelin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the green hill took his way;<br />
There chanced he to meet little Tilventin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bade him promptly stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now welcome little Tilventin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where hast thou passed the night?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I have passed the night at Brattingsborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where from helms the fire they smite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Count Sir Guncelin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From under his red helm glared:<br />
&ldquo;Sir Tilventin it had better been<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If that thou hadst never declared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Count Sir Guncelin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His sharp sword out he drew;<br />
It was little Tilventin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom he did to pieces hew.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>He rode away unto Brattingsborg,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the door he struck with his spear:<br />
&ldquo;Doth any warrior bide therein,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who will come and fight me here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Knight Sir Ivor Blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned to the West his eye:<br />
&ldquo;Now help me Wolf and Asmer hawk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear a kemp&rsquo;s fierce cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Knight Sir Ivor Blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He turned to the East his eye:<br />
&ldquo;Now help me, Odin, for thou hast might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear Sir Guncelin&rsquo;s cry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Count Sir Guncelin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His helm o&rsquo;er his white neck flung;<br />
That sound in the ear of his mother dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the dark night-time rung.</p>
<p>The Dame awoke at black midnight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And unto her Lord she cried:<br />
&ldquo;Now deign, now deign, thou highest God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With my son in this fray to bide!&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>The first course that together they rode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So strong were the knightly twain,<br />
Struck Guncelin Sir Ivor Blue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stretched him on the plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen, Count Sir Guncelin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If thou&rsquo;lt but let me live,<br />
My young and newly wedded bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I unto thee will give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not take thy wedded bride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon marriage stands my mind;<br />
Give me Salentia, sister thine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my fate to her&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ll
bind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode away to the bridal feast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Withouten more ado;<br />
Of stalwart knights, and warrior wights,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They invited the best they knew.</p>
<p>They invited Vidrik Verlandson,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Diderik, knight of Bern;<br />
They invited Olger the Daneman too,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who in battle is so stern.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>They invited Silvard Snarenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who before the bride should ride;<br />
And thither came also Langben the Jutt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sit at the Bridegroom&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>They invited Master Hildebrand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bridal torch he carried;<br />
And he was followed by Kempions twelve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep drank they whilst they tarried,</p>
<p>And thither came Folker Spilleman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his humour the kemps must bear;<br />
And thither came King Sigfrid Hoon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To his own pain and care.</p>
<p>Then came the proud Dame Grimhild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To prepare the bride for the hall;<br />
With iron she caused her feet to be shod,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And her fingers with steel tipped all.</p>
<p>And thither came Dame Gunda Hetta,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid the Norland hills her house;<br />
And there doth she pass a right merry life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With dance and with carouse.</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Thither came likewise Dame Brynhild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She cut for the bride the meat,<br />
Her followed slender ladies seven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Midst the knights they took their seat.</p>
<p>They follow&rsquo;d the bride to the chamber in.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of a luncheon slight to taste;<br />
And there she eat four tuns of pottage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which pleased her palate best.</p>
<p>Then before her sixteen oxen-bodies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And eighteen swine disappear;<br />
And before her thirst she could assuage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She drank seven tuns of beer.</p>
<p>So mighty the press of their garments was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they led the bride to the hall,<br />
That they brushed down, ere they ushered her in,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full fifteen ells from the wall.</p>
<p>They led the bride to the bride-bench up,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sat themselves down so light,<br />
That a bench of stone which they sat upon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sank into the ground outright.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>They placed before her the very best food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor did she the food decline;<br />
Fifteen oxen the sea-wife ate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And also ten fat swine.</p>
<p>The bridegroom&rsquo;s eyes were upon her fixed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And at length surprised he grew:<br />
&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er have I seen a youthful bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the dish such justice do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up then sprang the Kempions all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to one another did say:<br />
&ldquo;Now, whether shall we cast the bar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or fight in knightly way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warriors began to describe the round,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the verdant earth;<br />
For the honour and pride of the young sea-bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who should look on their deeds of worth.</p>
<p>The young bride up from the bride-bench sprang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two hands so weak had she;<br />
Towards her Langben the Giant leapt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine sport began to be.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>Then danced the table, then danced the bench,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the sparks from the helms flew high;<br />
Out ran the valiant warriors all:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Dame Devil thou mak&rsquo;st us
fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there arose a mightier dance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Ribe unto the Slee;<br />
The shortest warrior dancing had<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifteen ells beneath the knee.</p>
<p>The shortest warrior in that dance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was little Mimmering Tan;<br />
He was among that heathenish throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The only Christian man.</p>

<h3>Honesty</h3>
<p>No wonder honesty&rsquo;s a lasting article,<br />
Seeing that people seldom use a particle.</p>
<h3>A Politician</h3>
<p>He served his God in such a fashion<br />
As ne&rsquo;er put Satan in a passion.</p>
<h3>The Candle</h3>
<p>For foolish pastimes oft, full oft, they thee ignite,<br />
I oft a pastime prove for tongues with folly rife;<br />
By wasting of thyself thou yieldest others light,<br />
And I in self same way must use my luckless life.</p>

Was ever grieving and misgiving;<br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
