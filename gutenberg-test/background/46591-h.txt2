THE STRANGE

VOYAGE and ADVENTURES

of

DOMINGO GONSALES,

TO THE

WORLD in the MOON,

BY THE

Several GANZA'S, or Large GEESE.



Before I come to relate our extraordinary Voyage of Domingo Gonzales
to the World in the Moon, I will make a Halt at St. Hellens, or
Hellena, which is now possest by the Honourable East-India Company.
It is called the Sea Inn, because the English and other Nations stop
there as a Place for Watering and Refreshment in their long Voyages
to India. It was formerly seized by the Dutch, but retaken May
6th, 1673, by Captain Munday, with a Squadron of English Ships, and
three rich Dutch East India Ships made Prizes in the Harbour; since
which the Company have fortified and secured it, against any future
Invasion of Dutch, Portuguese, or Spaniards. It was called Santa
Helena by the Portuguese, who discovered it on St. Hellen's Day,
being April 2.

There is no Island in the World so far distant from the Continent or
main Land as this. It is about sixteen Leagues in Compass, in the
Ethiopic Sea; in 16 Degrees of South Latitude; about 1500 Miles from
the Cape of Good Hope; 360 from Angola in Africa; and 510 from
Brasile in America. It lies high out of the Water; and surrounded
on the Sea-coasts with steep Rocks, having within many Cliffs,
Mountains and Vallies, of which one is named Church-Valley, where
behind a small Church they climb up to the Mountains. To the South is
Apple-Dale, so called from the abundance of Oranges, Lemons, and
Pomegranates enough to furnish five or six Ships. On the West-side of
the Church, Ships have good Anchorage close under the Shore, to prevent
the Winds which blow fiercely from the adjacent high Mountains.

The Air seems temperate and healthful, so that sick Men brought
ashore there, in a short Time recover; yet the Heat in the Vallies
is as intolerable as the Cold upon the Mountains; it commonly rains
there five or six Times a Day, so that the Barrenness of the Hills is
not occasioned for the want of Water, of which it hath two or three
good Springs for furnishing Ships with fresh Water; the Ground of
its own Accord brings forth wild Pease and Beans, also whole Woods
of Orange, Lemon, and Pomegranate Trees, all the Year long, laden
both with Blossoms and Fruit, good Figs; abundance of Ebony and
Rose-trees, Parsly, Mustard-seed, Purslain, Sorrel, and the like; the
Woods and Mountains are full of Goats, large Rams, and wild Swine,
but difficult to be taken. When the Portuguese discovered it, they
found neither four-footed Beasts nor Fruit-trees, but only fresh Water;
they afterward planted Fruit-trees, which so increased since, that
all the Vallies stand full of them; Partridges, Pigeons, Moor-hens,
and Peacocks breed here numerously, whereof a good Marksman may soon
provide a Dinner for his Friends. On the Cliff-Islands, on the South,
are thousands of grey and black Mews, or Sea-Pies, and white and
coloured Birds, some, with long, others with short Necks, who lay their
Eggs on the Rocks, and suffer themselves to be taken with the Hand,
gazing at their Surprizers, till they are knocked on the Head with
Sticks.

From the Salt-water beating against the Cliffs, a Froth or Scum remains
in some Places, which the Heat of the Sun so purifies, that it becomes
white and good Salt; some of the Mountains yield. Bole Armoniac, and
a fat Earth like Terra Lemnia. The Sea will answer the Pains of a
patient Fisherman, who must use an Angle, not a Net, because of the
foul Ground and beating of the Waves; the chief are Mackrel, Roach,
Carp, but differing in Colour from those among us; Eels as big, as a
Man's Arm, and well tasted Crabs, Lobsters, Oysters and Mussels as good
as English.

It is in this Island that the Scene of that notable Fancy, called,
The Man in the Moon, or a Discourse of a Voyage thither, by Domingo
Gonsales is laid, written by a learned Bishop, saith the ingenious
Bishop Wilkins, who calls it a pleasant and well contrived Fancy, in
his own Book, intituled, A Discourse of the New World, tending to
prove that it is possible there may be another habitable World in
the Moon; wherein among other curious Arguments he affirms, that
this hath been the direct Opinion of divers antient, and some modern
Mathematicians, and may probably be deduced from the Tenets of others,
neither does it contradict any Principle of Reason nor Faith; and that
as their World is our Moon, so our World is theirs.

Now this small Tract having so worthy a Person to vouch for it, and
many of our English Historians having published for Truth, what is
almost as improbable as this, as Sir John Mandavil in his Travels
and others, and this having what they are utterly destitute of,
that is, Invention mixed with Judgment; and was judged worthy to be
Licensed fifty years ago, and not since reprinted, whereby it would be
utterly lost. I have thought fit to republish the Substance thereof,
wherein the Author says he does not design to discourse his Readers
into a Belief of each particular Circumstance, but expects that his
new Discovery of a new World, may find little better Entertainment
than Columbus had in his first Discovery of America, though yet
that poor Espial betrayed so much Knowledge as hath since increased
to vast Improvements, and the then Unknown is now found to be of
as large Extent as all the other known World; that there should be
Antipodes was once thought as great a Paradox, as now that the Moon
should be habitable. But the Knowledge of it may be reserved for this
our discovering Age, wherein our Virtuosi can by their Telescopes gaze
the Sun into Spots, and descry Mountains in the Moon. But this and much
more must be left to the Critics, as well as the following Relation of
our little Eye-witness and great Discoverer, which you shall have in
his own Spanish Stile, and delivered with that Grandeur and Thirst of
Glory, which is generally imputed to that Nation.

It is known to all the Countries of Andaluzia, that I Domingo
Gonsales was born of a noble Family in the renowned City of Seville.
My Father's Name being Therando Gonsales, near Kinsman on the
Mother's Side to Don Pedro Sanches the worthy Count of Almanera,
my Mother was the Daughter of the famous Lawyer Otho Perez de
Sallaveda, Governor of Barcellona, and Corrigidor of Biscay;
I being the youngest of seventeen Children, was put to School, and
designed to the Church; but Heaven purposing to use my Service in
Matters of far another Nature, inspired me with spending some Time in
the Wars; it was at the Time that Don Fernando, the renowned Duke
D'Alva, was sent into the Low Countries in 1568; I then following
the Current of my Desire, leaving the University of Salamanca,
whither my Parents had sent me, without giving Notice to any of my
Friends, got through France to Antwerp, where I arrived in a mean
Condition. For having sold my Books, Bedding, and other Things, which
yielded me about 30 Ducats; and borrowed twenty more of my Father's
Friends; I bought a little Nag, wherewith I travelled more thriftily
than usually young Gentlemen do, till arriving within a League of
Antwerp, some of the cursed Gueses set upon me, and bereaved me
of my Horse, Money, and all; so I was forced through Necessity to
enter into the Service of Marshal Cossey a French Nobleman, whom I
served in an honourable Employ, though mine Enemies, to my Disgrace
affirm, I was his Horse-keeper's Boy; but for that Matter, I refer
myself to Count Mansfield, and other Persons of Condition, who have
often testified to many worthy Men, the very Truth of the Business,
which indeed was this, Monsieur Cossey being about this Time sent
to the Duke D'Alva, Governor of the Low Countries, he informing
the Nobility of my Birth, and my late Misfortune, judging it would
be no small Honour to him to have a Spaniard of that Quality about
him, furnished me with a Horse, Arms and whatever I wanted, using my
Service, after I had learned French, in writing his Letters, because
my Hand was very fair. In time of War, if upon Necessity, I sometimes
dressed my own Horse, I ought not to be reproached therewith, since I
count it the part of a Gentleman to submit to the vilest Office for the
Service of his Prince.

The first Expedition I was in, was when the Marshal my Friend met the
Prince of Orange making a Road into France, and forced him to fly
even to the Walls of Cambray: It was my good Fortune to defeat a
Trooper, by killing his Horse with my Pistol, who falling upon his Leg,
could not stir, but yielded to my Mercy; I knowing my own Weakness of
Body, and seeing him a lusty tall Fellow, thought it the surest Way to
dispatch him, which having done, I plundered him of a Chain, Money, and
other Things to the Value of 200 Ducats. This Money was no sooner in my
Pockets, but I resumed the Remembrance of my Nobility, and taking my
Audience of Leave from Monsieur Cossey, I instantly repaired to the
Duke D'Alva's Court, where divers of my Kindred seeing my Pocket full
of good Crowns, were ready enough to acknowledge me: By their means I
was received into Pay, and in Time obtained Favour with the Duke, who
would sometimes jest a little more severely at my Personage than I
could well bear, for though I must acknowledge my Stature is so little,
as I think no Man living is less, yet since it is the Work of Heaven
and not my own, he ought not to have upbraided a Gentleman therewith,
and those glorious Things that have happened to me may evince, that
wonderful Matters may be performed by very unlikely Bodies, if the Mind
be good, and Fortune second our Endeavours.

Though the Duke's Jokes a little disgusted me, yet I endeavoured to
conceal my Resentment, and accommodating myself to some other of his
Humours, I was so far interested in his Favour, that at his going into
Spain, whither I attended him, by his Kindness, and other Accidents,
wherein by my Industry I was seldom wanting to myself, I was able to
carry home 3000 Crowns in my Pocket.

At my Return, my Parents, who were extremely disturbed at my Departure,
received me with Joy, which was increased because they found I had
brought wherewith to maintain Myself without being chargeable to them,
or lessening the Portions of my Brothers and Sisters. But doubting I
would spend it as lightly as I got it, they sollicited me to marry
the Daughter of John Figueres, a considerable Merchant of Lisbon,
to which I complied, and putting my Marriage Money, and good Part of
my own into the Hands of my father, I lived like a Gentleman many
Years very happily: At length a Quarrel arising between me and Pedro
Delgades, a Gentleman and Kinsman of mine; it grew so high, that
when no Mediation of Friends could prevail, we two went alone with
our Swords into the Field, where it was my Chance to kill him, tho' a
stout proper Man; but what I wanted in Strength I Supplied in Courage,
and my Agility countervailed for his Stature. This being acted in
Carmona, I fled to Lisbon, thinking to conceal myself with some
Friends of my Father-in-Law, till the Business might be accommodated;
at which Time, a famous Spanish Count coming from the West-Indies,
published triumphant Declarations of a great Victory he had obtained
against the English near the Isle of Pines, whereas in reality
he got nothing at all in that Voyage but Blows, and a considerable
Loss. It had been well if Vanity and Lying had been his only Crimes;
his Covetousness had like to have been my utter Ruin, though since it
hath proved the Occasion of eternizing my Name I verily believe to
all Posterity, and to the unspeakable Benefit of all Mortals for ever
hereafter, at least if it please Heaven that I return home safe to my
Country, and give perfect Instructions how those almost incredible and
impossible Acquirements may be imparted to the World. You shall then
see Men flying in the Air, from one Place to another, you shall then
be able to send Messages many hundred Miles in an Instant, and receive
Answers immediately, without the Help of any Creature upon Earth; you
shall then presently impart your Mind to your Friend, though in the
most remote and obscure Place of a populous City, and a Multitude of
other notable Experiments; but what exceeds all, you shall then have
the Discovery of a New World, and Abundance of rare and incredible
Secrets of Nature, which the Philosophers of former Ages never so much
as dreamt of; but I must be cautious in publishing these wonderful
Mysteries, till our Statesmen have considered how they may consist
with the Policy and good Government of our Country, and whether the
Fathers of the Church may not judge the divulging them prejudicial
to the Catholic Faith, which (by those Wonders I have seen above any
mortal Man before me) I am instructed to advance without Respect to any
temporal Advantage whatsoever.

But to proceed: This huffing Captain pretended much Discontent for the
Death of Delgades, who was indeed some Kin to him; however, he was
willing to be quiet if I would give him a thousand Ducats: I had now,
besides a Wife, two Sons, whom I was not willing to beggar, only to
satisfy the avaricious Humour of this Boaster, and so was necessitated
to take some other Course. I embarked in a stout Carrick bound for
the East-Indies, carrying the Value of two thousand Ducats to trade
with, leaving as much more for the Support of my Wife and Children
behind, whatever Misfortune might happen to me. In the Indies I
thrived exceedingly, laying out my Stock in Diamonds, Emeralds, and
Pearls, which I bought at such easy Rates, that my Stock safely
arriving in Spain, (as I understood it did) must needs yield ten for
one. But having doubled Cape Bona Esperanza in my Way home, I fell
dangerously sick, expediting nothing but Death, which had undoubtedly
happened, but that we just then recovered the blessed Isle of St.
Hellens, the only Paradise I believe on Earth, for Healthfulness of
Air, and Fruitfulness of Soil, producing all Necessaries for the Life
of Man. It is about 16 Leagues in Compass, and has no firm Land or
Continent within 300 Leagues, nay not so much as an Island within an
hundred Leagues of it, so that it may seem a Miracle of Nature, that
out of so vast and tempestuous an Ocean, such a small Rock or Piece
of Ground should arise and discover itself. On the South is a good
Harbour, and near it divers small Houses built by the Portuguese
to accommodate Strangers, with a pretty Chapel handsomely beautified
with a Tower, and Bell therein. Near it is a Stream of excellent fresh
Water, divers handsome Walks, planted on both Sides with Orange, Lemon,
Pomegranate, Almond-Trees and the like, which bear Fruit all the Year,
as do also divers others. There are Store of Garden Herbs, with Wheat,
Pease, Barley, and most Kinds of Pulse; but it chiefly aboundeth
with Cattle and Fowl, as Goats, Swine, Sheep, Partridges, wild Hens,
Pheasants, Pigeons, and wild Fowl beyond Credit; but especially about
February and March are to be seen huge Flocks of a kind of wild
Swans, (whereof I shall have Occasion to speak more hereafter) who like
our Cuckows and Nightingales, go away at a certain Season, and are no
more seen that Year.

On this happy Island did they set me ashore with a Negro to attend me,
where. I recovered my Health, and continued a whole Year, solacing
myself for want of human Society with Birds and brute Beasts; Diego
my Black moor was forced to live in a Cave at the West End of the Isle,
for had we dwelt together, Victuals would not have been so plenty with
us; but now, if one succeeded well in hunting or fowling, the other
would find Means to treat him, and if both missed, we were fain to
look out sharply; but this seldom happened, since no Creature there
fears a Man more than a Goat or Cow, whereby I easily tamed divers
Kinds of Birds and Beasts by only muzzling them, so that till they came
either to me or Diego they could not feed. At first I much delighted
in a Kind of Partridges, and a tame Fox, whereof I made good Use for
if I had Occasion to confer with Diego, I would take one of them
muzzled and hungry, and tying a Note about his Neck, beat him from me,
whereupon he would strait away to Diego's Cave, and if he were not
there, would beat about till he found him, yet this Conveyance being
not without some Inconvenience, I persuaded Diego, (who tho' a Fellow
of good Parts, was content to be ruled by me) to remove to a Cape on
the North-west Part of the Island, being though a League off, yet
within Sight of my House and Chapel, and so when the Weather was fair,
we could by Signals declare our Minds to each other in an Instant
either by Night or Day, wherein we took much Pleasure. If in the
Night I would signify any Thing to him, I set up a Light in the Bell
Tower, which was a pretty large-Room with a fair Window well glazed,
and the Walls within plaistered white, so that though the Light were
but small, it made a great Show; after this Light had stood half an
Hour, I covered it, and then if I saw any Signal of Light again from my
Companion I knew he waited for my Notice, and so by hiding and shewing
my Light according to the Agreement betwixt us, I certified him of
what I pleased. In the Day I advertised him by Smoke, Dust, and other
refined Ways.

After a while I grew weary of it as too painful, and again used my
winged Messengers, upon the Shore, about the Mouth of our River, I
found Store of a kind of wild Swans feeding upon Prey, both of Fish and
Birds, and which is more strange; having one Claw like an Eagle, and
the other like a Swan. These Birds breeding here in infinite Numbers,
I took thirty or forty of them young, and bred them up by Hand for
Recreation; yet not without some Thoughts of that Experiment which I
after put in Practice. These being strong and able to continue a great
Flight, I taught them first to come at Call afar off, not using any
Noise, but only shewing them a white Cloth; and here I found it true
what Plutarch affirms, That Creatures which eat Flesh are more docible
than others. 'Tis wonderful to think what Tricks I taught them ere they
were a Quarter old, amongst others I used them by Degrees to fly with
Burdens, wherein I found them able beyond Belief, and a white Sheet
being displayed to them by Diego, upon the Side of a Hill, they would
carry from me to him Bread, Flesh, or whatever I pleased, and upon the
like Calf come to me again. Having proceeded thus far, I consulted how
to join a Number of them together, so as to carry a heavier Weight,
which if I could compass, I might enable a Man to be carried safely
in the Air from one Place to another. I puzzled my Wits extremely
with this Thought, and upon Trial found, that if many were put to the
bearing of one great Burthen, by reason it was impossible all of them,
should rise together just at one Instant, the first that rise finding
himself stayed by a Weight heavier than he could stir, would soon give
over, and so the second, third, and all the rest. I contrived at last
a Way whereby each might rise with only his own Proportion of Weight,
I fastened about each Gansa a little Pulley of Cork, and putting a
String of a just Length through it, I fastened one End to a Block of
almost eight Pounds Weight, and tied a two Pound Weight to the other
End of the String, and then causing the Signal to be erected, they all
arose together, being four in Number, and carried away my Block to the
Place appointed. This hitting so luckily, I added two or three Birds
more, and made Trial of their carrying a Lamb, whose Happiness I much
envied, that he should be the first living Creature to partake of such
an excellent Device.

At length after divers Trials, I was surprized with a great Longing
to cause myself to be carried in the same Manner, Diego my Moor was
likewise possessed with the same Desire, and had I not loved him well,
and wanted his Service, I should have resented his ambitious Thought;
for I count it greater Honour to have been the first Flying Man,
than to be another Neptune who first adventured to sail on the Sea.
Yet seeming not to understand his Intention, I only told him, that all
my Gansas were not strong enough to carry him, being a Man though
of no great Bulk, yet twice heavier than myself. Having prepared all
Necessaries, I one Time placed myself and all my Utensils on the Top
of a Rock at the River's Mouth, and putting myself upon my Engine at
full Sea, I caused Diego to advance the Signal, whereupon my Birds,
twenty-five in Number, rose all at once, and carried me over lustily to
the Rock on the other Side, being about a Quarter of a League, I chose
this Time and Place, because if any Thing had, fallen out contrary to
Expectation, the worst that could happen was only falling into the
Water; and being able to swim well, I hoped to receive little Hurt in
my Fall. When I was once safe over, O how did my Heart even swell with
Joy and Admiration at my own Invention; how often, did I with myself
in the Midst of Spain, that I might fill the World with the Fame of
my Glory and Renown? Every Hour I had a longing Desire for the coming
of the Indian Fleet to take me home with them, which then staid
three Months beyond their usual Time: At length they arrived, being
three Carricks much weather-beaten, the Men sick and weak, and so were
constrained to refresh themselves in our Island a whole Month. The
Admiral was called Alphonso de Xima, a valiant, wise Man, desirous
of Glory, and worthy better Fortune than afterwards befel him; to him
I discovered my Device of the Gansas; being satisfied, that it was
impossible otherwise to persuade him to take many Birds into his Ship,
who for the Niceness of their Provision would be more troublesome than
so many Men; yet I adjured him by Oaths and Persuasions to be secret
in the Business, though I did not much doubt it, alluring myself he
durst not impart the Experiment, to any before our King were acquainted
therewith. I had more Apprehension left Ambition, and the Desire of
gaining to himself the Honour of so admirable an Invention, should
tempt, him to dispatch me. However I was forced to run the Risque
unless I would adventure the Loss of my Birds, the like whereof for my
Purpose were not to be had in Christendom, nor was I sure ever to bring
up others to serve my Turn.

It happened all these Doubts were causeless, the Man I believe was
honest, but the Misfortune we met with prevented all these Thoughts.
Thursday, June 21, 1599, we set Sail for Spain, I having allowed me
a convenient Cabin for my Birds, and Engine, which the Captain would
have persuaded me to have left behind, and it was a Wonder I did not,
but my good Fortune saved my Life, for after two Months Sail we met
with an English Fleet about 10 Leagues from the Island of Teneriff,
one of the Canaries, famous for a Hill therein called Pico, which
is seen at Sea above an hundred Leagues off. We had aboard five Times
their number of Men, all in Health, and were well provided with
Ammunition; yet finding them resolved to fight, and knowing what
infinite Riches we carried, concluded it better if possible to escape,
than by encountering a Crew of desperate Fellows, to hazard not only
our Lives, which a Man of Courage does not value, but the Estates of
many poor Merchants, who I am afraid were undone by the Miscarriage
of this Business. Our Fleet consisted of five Sail, that is, three
Carricks, a Bark, and a Caravel, who coming from St. Thomas Isle, had
in an ill Hour overtaken us some Days before. The English had three
Ships well provided, who no sooner spied but presently engaged us, and
changing their Course, endeavoured to bring us under their Lee, which
they might easily do as the Wind then flood, they being light nimble
Vessels, as English Ship's generally are; ours heavy, deep laden,
and foul with the Sea; So our Captain resolved, wisely enough it may
be, not neither valiantly nor fortunately, to fly, commanding us to
disperse ourselves. The Caravel by too much Haste fell upon one of the
Carricks and bruised her so, that one of the English easily fetched
her up and entered her, the Caravel sinking before our Eyes. The Bark
escaped unpursued, and another, of our Carricks after some Chase was
given over by the Enemy, who expecting a sufficient Booty of us, and
getting us between them, fell upon us with much Fury; our Captain
hereupon gave Direction to run ashore upon Teneriff, the Port whereof
we could not recover, saying, "That he hoped to save Part of the Goods,
and some of our Lives, and he had rather the rest should be lost, than
all fall into the Mercy of our Foes."

When I heard this Resolution, observing the Sea to work high, and
knowing all the Coast to be so full of Rocks and Shoals, that it was
impossible our Ship should come near the Land, unless broken into a
thousand Pieces, I represented to the Captain the Desperateness of
the Attempt, wishing him rather to try the Kindness of the Enemy,
than throw away himself and so many brave Men; but he would by no
Remonstrances be removed from his Resolution, therefore finding it high
Time to shift for myself, I locked up my little Casket of Jewels, which
putting into my Sleeve, I then betook me to my Gansas, and having
harnessed them to my Engine, and put myself thereon, supposing, as
indeed it happened, that when the Ship should split, my Birds, though
they wanted their Signal, yet for saving their own Lives, which Nature
hath taught all Creatures to preserve, would make toward Land, which
fell out according to my Expectation; the People in the Ship wondered
what I was doing, none being acquainted with the use of my Birds but
the Captain, Diego being in the other Ship which fled away unpursued;
we were about half a League from Land, when our Carrick struck upon
a Rock, and split to Pieces, upon which I let loose the Reins to my
Birds, having first placed myself upon the Top of the Deck, and with
the Shock they all arose carrying me fortunately to the Land; of which
you need not doubt but I was very joyful, though it was a miserable
Sight to behold my Friends and Acquaintance in that woful Distress,
of whom yet many escaped better than they expected, for the English
launching out their Cock-boats, discovered more generous Tempers than
we are pleased to allow them, taking Compassion of their Calamity,
and endeavouring with all Diligence to save them from the Fury of the
Waves, though with much Danger to themselves, among others they took up
our Captain, who, as Father Pacio since told me, having put himself
with twelve others into the Cock-boat, was forced to yield to one
Captain Raymund, who carried him and our Pilot along with them in
their Voyage to the East-Indies, whither they were bound, but it was
their hard Fate, by a Breach of the Sea near Cape Buona Esperanca, to
be swallowed of the merciless Waves, whole Rage they awhile before had
so hardly escaped; the rest as I likewise heard, who were about twenty
six Persons they took into their Ship, and set them on Land at Cape
Verde.

As for myself, being now ashore in an Island inhabited by Spaniards,
I reckoned I was safe, but found myself mistaken, for it was my hap to
pitch upon that Part of the Isle where the Pike begins to rise, which
is inhabited by a Savage People who live upon the Sides of that Hill,
the Top whereof is for the most Part covered with Snow, and formerly
accounted, for its Steepness, inaccessible, either for Man or Beast,
yet these Savages fearing the Spaniards keep as near the Top as they
can, never coming down into the fruitful Vallies but to seek for Booty;
a Crew of these Outlaws happened to spy me soon after I landed, and
thinking they had got a Prize, approached me with all Speed; I guess
their Design before they came within half a Mile, when perceiving them
come down the Hill directly toward me, with long Staves and other
Weapons, I thought it necessary to secure myself from these Villains,
who out of Hatred to us Spaniards would have cut me to Pieces; the
Country was sandy, but the Pike beginning to lift up itself, I espied
in the Side a white Cliff, which I Hoped my Ganzas Would take for
a Mark, and being put up, would make all that way, whereby I might
be carried so far, that those barbarous Rascals should not overtake
me, before I got to some Spaniard's House, or hid myself, till by
the Covert of the Night I might travel to Laguna, the chief City of
the Island, three Miles off. So I settled myself upon my Engine, and
let loose the Reins to my Gansas, who by good Fortune took all one
Course, tho' not just the Way I aimed at. But what of that! O Reader
prick up thy Ears, and prepare thyself to hear the strangest Chance
that ever happened to any Mortal, and which I know thou wilt not have
the Grace to believe till thou seest the like Experiment, which I doubt
not in a short Time may be performed. My Gansas, like so many Horses
that had gotten the Bit between their Teeth, made not their Flight
toward the Cliff I intended, though I used my wonted Means to direct
the Leader the Flock that Way, but with Might and Main took up toward
the Top of the Pike, and never stopt till they came there, a Place in
vulgar Estimation (though since experimentally contradicted) fifteen
Miles in Height. What kind of Place this was I would gladly relate, but
that I hasten to Matters of greater Importance: When I was set down
there, my poor Gansas fell to panting, blowing, and gaping for Breath
as if they would all have died, so I did not trouble them awhile,
forbearing to draw them in, which they never used to endure without
struggling, but little did I expect what followed.

It was now the Season that these Birds take their Flight away, as
our Cuckows and Swallows do in Spain towards Autumn, and as I
afterwards found, being mindful of their usual Voyage, just when I
began to settle myself to take them in, they with one Consent rose up,
and having no other higher Place to make toward, to my unspeakable Fear
and Amazement, struck bolt upright, and never left towring upward,
still higher and higher, for the Space, as I guest, of an Hour, after
which I thought they laboured less than before, till at length, ah
wonderful! they remained immoveable, as steadily as if they had sat
upon so many Perches; the Lines slacked, neither I, nor the Engine
moved at all, but continued still, as having no Manner of Weight. I
found then by Experience, what no Philosopher ever dreamt of, namely,
that those Things we call heavy do not fall towards the Center of the
Earth as their natural Place, but are drawn by a secret Property of the
Globe of the Earth, or rather something within it, as the Load-stone
draweth Iron, which is within the Compass of its attractive Beams. For
though my Gansas could continue unmoved, without being sustained by
any Thing but the Air, as easily and quietly as a Fish in the Water,
yet if they forced themselves never so little, it is impossible to
imagine with what Swiftness they were carried, either Upward, Downward,
or Sideways; I must ingenuously confess my Horror and Amazement in
this Place was such, that had I not been armed with a true Spanish
Resolution, I should certainly have died for Fear.

The next Thing that disturbed me was the Swiftness of the Motion, which
was so extraordinary, that it almost stopt my Breath, if I should liken
it to an Arrow out of a Bow, or a Stone thrown down from the Top of
an high Tower, it would come vastly short of it; another Thing was
exceeding troublesome to me, that is the Illusions of Devils and wicked
Spirits, who the first Day of my Arrival came about me in great Numbers
in the Likeness of Men and Women, wondering at me like so many Birds
about an Owl, and speaking several Languages which I understood not,
till at last I met with some that spoke good Spanish, some Dutch,
and others Italian, all which I understood and here I had only a
Touch of the Sun's Absence once for a short Time, having him ever after
in my Sight. Now though my Gansas were entangled in my Lines, yet
they easily seized upon divers Kinds of Flies and Birds, especially
Swallows and Cuckows, whereof there were Multitudes, even like Motes
in the Sun, though I never saw them eat any Thing at all. I was much
obliged to those, whether Men or Devils I know not, who among divers
Discourses told me, "If I would follow their Directions, I should not
only be carried, safe Home, but be assured to command at all, Times
all the Pleasures of that Place." To which Motion, not daring to give
a flat Denial, I desired Time to consider, and withal indebted them,
(though I felt no Hunger at all, which may seem strange) to help me
to some Victuals, lead I should starve in my Journey so they readily
brought me very good Flesh and Fish of several Sorts, and well dressed,
but that it was extreme fresh without any Relish of Salt. Wines
likewise I tasted of divers Kinds as good as any in Spain and Beer no
better in all Antwerp. They advised me, that while I had Opportunity
I should make my Provisions, telling me, that till the next Thursday
they could help me to no more, at which Time they would find Means to
carry me back, and set me safe in Spain, in any Place I would desire,
provided I would become one of their Fraternity, and enter into such
Covenants as they had made to their Captain and Master, whom they would
not name: I answered civily, "I saw little Reason to rejoice in such an
Offer, desiring them to be mindful of me as Occasion served;" so for that
Time I was rid of them having first furnished my Pockets with as much
Victuals as I could thrust in, among which I would be sure to find a
Place for a small Bottle of good Canary.

I shall now declare the Quality of the Place wherein I was: The Clouds
I perceived to be all under between me and the Earth. The Stars,
because it was always Day, I saw at all Times alike, not shining
bright, as we see in the Night upon Earth, but of a whitish Colour,
like the Moon with us in the Day-Time, those that were seen, which
were not many, shewed far greater than with us, yea, as I guessed no
less than ten Times bigger: As for the Moon, being then within two
Days of the Change, she appeared of an huge and dreadful Greatness.
It is not to be forgot, that no Stars appeared but on that Part of
the Hemisphere next the Moon, and the nearer to her, the larger they
appeared again; whether I lay quiet and rested, or were carried in the
Air, I perceived myself to be always directly between the Moon and the
Earth, whereby 'tis plain, that my Gansas took their Way directly
toward the Moon, and that when we rested, as we did at first for many
Hours, either we were insensibly carried round about the Globe of the
Earth, though I perceived no such Motion, or else that, according to
the Opinion of Copernicus, the Earth is carried about, and turneth
round perpetually, from West to East, leaving to the Planets only that
Motion which the Astronomers call natural, and is not upon the Poles
of the Equinoctial, commonly called the Poles of the World, but upon
those of the Zodiac; the Air in that Place I found without any Wind,
and exceeding temperate, neither Hot nor Cold, where neither the Sun
Beams had any Object to reflect upon, nor the Earth and Water appear
to affect the Air with their natural Quality of Coldness; as for
the Philosophers attributing Heat and Moisture to the Air, I always
esteem'ed it a Fancy: Lastly, I remember that after my Departure from
the Earth, I never felt either Hunger or Thirst, whether the Purity of
the Air, freed From the Vapours of the Earth and Water, might yield
Nature sufficient Nourishment, or what else might be the Cause I cannot
determine, but so I found it, though I was perfectly in Health both of
Body and Mind, even above my usual Vigour.

Some Hours after the Departure of that Devilish Company, my Gansas
began to bestir themselves, still directing their Course toward the
Globe or Body of the Moon, making their Way with such incredible
Swiftness, that I conceive they advanced little less than fifty Leagues
in an Hour, in which Passage I observed three Things very remarkable,
one that the farther we went the less the Globe of the Earth appeared
to us, and that of the Moon still larger: Again the Earth, which I
had ever in mine Eye, seemed to mask itself with a kind of Brightness
like another Moon, and as we discern certain Spots or Clouds as it
were in the Moon, so did I then see the like in the Earth; but whereas
the Form of these Spots in the Moon are always the same, these on the
Earth seemed by Degrees to change every Hour; the Reason whereof seems
to be, that whereas the Earth according to his natural Motion (for
such a Motion I am now satisfied (he hath according to the Opinion of
Copernicus) turns round upon her own Axis every four and twenty Hours
from West to East) I should at first see in the Middle of the Body of
this new Star the Earth, a Spot like a Pear, with a Morsel bit out on
one Side, in some Hours I should observe this Spot move away toward
the East: This no doubt was the main Land of Africa; then might I
perceive a great shining Brightness in that Place which continued about
the same Time, and was questionless the vast Atlantick Ocean: After
this succeeded a Spot almost Oval, just as we see America described
in our Maps, then another immense Clearness, representing Mare del
zar or the South Sea; lastly, a number of Spots like the Countries
and lands in the East-Indies, so that it seemed to me no other than
an huge mathematical Globe turned round leisurely before me, wherein
successively all the Countries of our earthly World were within
twenty-four Hours represented to my View, and this was all the Means I
now had to number the Days, and reckon the Time.

I could now wish that Philosophers and Mathematicians would confess
their own Blindness, who have hitherto made the World believe that the
Earth hath no Motion, and to confirm it, are forced to attribute to
every one of the celestial Bodies two Motions directly contrary to each
other, one from the East to the West, to be performed in twenty-four
Hours with an impetuous rapid Motion; the other from West to East in
several Proportions: O incredible Supposition! that those huge Bodies
of the fixed Stairs in the highest Orb, whereof they confess divers,
are above an hundred Times bigger than the whole Earth, should like so
many Nails in a Cart-wheel be whirled about in so short a Time; whereas
it is many thousand Years, no less (say they) than thirty thousand,
before that Orb finishes his Course from West to East, which they call
his natural Motion; now whereas they allow their natural Course from
West to East to every one of them, therein they do well; the Moon
performs it in seven and twenty Days, the Sun, Venus and Mercury in
a Year or thereabout, Mars in three Years, Jupiter in twelve, and
Saturn in thirty. But to attribute to these celestial Bodies contrary
Motions at once, is an absurd Conceit, and much more to imagine, that
the same Orb wherein the fixed Stars are, whose natural, Course takes
up so many thousands of Years, should be turned about every twenty-four
Hours. I will not go so far as Copernicus, who makes, the Sun the
Center of the Earth and immoveable, neither will I be positive in any
Thing, only this I say, allow the Earth its Motion, which these Eyes
of mine can testify to be true, and all those Absurdities are removed,
every one having only his own single and proper Motion.

But where am I? I promised an History, and am unawares turned Disputer.
One Accident more befell me worth mentioning, that during my Stay
I saw a kind of a reddish Cloud coming toward me, and continually
approaching nearer, which at last I perceived was nothing but a
huge Swarm of Locusts. He that reads the Discourses of learned Men
concerning them, as John Leo of Africa, and others who relate that
they are seen in the Air several Days before they fall on the Earth,
and adds thereto this Experience of mine, will easily conclude, that
they can come from no other Place than the Globe of the Moon. But now
give me leave to go on quietly in my Journey for eleven or twelve Days,
during all which Time I was carried directly toward the Globe or Body
of the Moon, with such a violent Whirling as is inexpressible, for I
cannot imagine a Bullet out of a Cannon could make Way through the
vaporous and muddy Air near the Earth with half that Celerity; which is
the more strange, since my Gansas moved their Wings but now and then,
and sometimes for a quarter of an Hour not at all, only holding them
stretched out, as we see Kites, and Eagles sometimes do for a short
Space, during which Pauses, I suppose they took their Naps, and Times
of Sleeping, for other Times I could perceive they never had any; for
myself I was so fastened to mine Engine, that I durst slumber enough to
serve my Turn, which I took with as great Ease, as if I had lain on the
best Down-bed in Spain.

After eleven Days Passage in this violent Flight, I perceived we began
to approach to another Earth (if I may so call it) being the Globe or
very Body of that Star which we call the Moon. The first Difference I
found between this and our Earth was, that it appeared in its natural
Colours, as soon as ever I was free from the Attraction of the Earth;
whereas with us, a Thing a League or two from us, puts on that deadly
Colour of Blue. I then perceived also that this World was the greatest
Part covered with a huge mighty Sea, those Parts only being dry Land
which, are to us somewhat darker than the rest of her Body, I mean,
what the Country People call, The Man in the Moon, and that Part
which shines so bright is another Ocean besprinkled with Islands, which
for their Smallness we cannot discern so far off; so that the Splendor
which appears to us in the Night, is nothing but the Reflection of the
Sun-beams returned to us out of the Water as from a Lookin'glass. How
much this disagrees with what our Philosophers teach in the Schools is
evident: But alas, how many of their Errors hath Time and Experience in
this our Age, and among other vain Conjectures, who hath not hitherto
believed the upper Region of the Air to be very hot; as being next,
forsooth, to the natural Place of the Element of Fire; meer Vanities,
Fancies and Dreams: For after I was once free from the attractive Beams
of that tyrannous Load-stone the Earth, I found the Air altogether
serene, without Winds, Rain, Mists or Clouds, neither hot nor cold,
but constantly pleasant, calm and comfortable, till my Arrival in that
New World of the Moon as for that Region of Fire, our Philosophers
talk of, I heard no News of it, mine Eyes have sufficiently informed me
there is no such Thing.

The Earth had now by turning about shewed me all her Parts twelve
Times, when I finished my Course; for when my Reckoning it seemed to
be (as indeed it was) Tuesday, September 11, (at which Time the Moon
being two Days old was in the twentieth Degree of Libra) my Gansas
seemed by one Consent to stay their Course, and rested for certain
Hours, after which they took their Flight, and in less than an Hour
set me on the Top of an high Hill in that Other World, where many
wonderful Things were presented to my Sight. For I observed first, that
though the Globe of the Earth appeared much greater there than the Moon
doth to us, even three Times bigger, yet all Things there were ten,
twenty, yea thirty Times larger than ours; their Trees were thrice as
high, and above five Times, broader and thicker; so were their Herbs,
Birds, and Beasts, though I cannot well compare them to ours, because I
found not any kind of Beast or Bird there which any way resembled ours,
except Swallows, Nightingales, Cuckoos, Woodcocks, Batts, and some
kind of Wild Fowl: And likewise such Birds as my Gansas, all which,
as I now perceived, spend their Time in their Absence from us, in that
World, neither do they differ in any Thing from ours, but are the very
same kind.

No sooner was I upon the Ground, but I found myself extreme hungry;
stepping then to the next Tree, I fastened my Engine and Ganzas
thereto, and in great Haste fell to examining my Pockets for the
Victuals I had reserved there; but to my great Surprize and Vexation,
instead of Partridges and Capons, which I thought I had hoarded there,
I found nothing but a Medley of dry Leaves, Goats Hair, Sheep or Goats
Dung, Moss, and the like; my Canary-wine was turned, and stunk like
Horse-piss: O the Villainy and Cheats of these cursed Spirits, whose
Assistance if I had depended on, in what a Condition had I been! While
I stood musing at this strange Metamorphosis, on a sudden I heard my
Gansas fluttering behind me, and looking back, I spied them falling
greedily upon a Shrub within the Reach of their Lines, whose Leaves
they fed earnestly upon, whereas before I had never seen them eat any
green Thing whatever; so stepping to the Shrub; I put a Leaf to my
Mouth; the Taste was so excellent; that I cannot express it, and if I
had not with Discretion moderated my Appetite, I should have forfeited
thereon; yet it happened, to be a good Bait both for me and my Birds,
when we had most Need of Refreshment.

Scarce had we ended our Banquet, when I saw myself surrounded with a
strange kind of People both in Feature, Manners, and Apparel; their
Stature was very different, but they Were generally twice as high as
ours; their Shape and Countenance pleasant, and their Habit hardly to
be described; for I never saw either Cloth, Silk, nor other Stuff,
like that whereof their Cloths were made; neither can I possibly
relate their Colour, they being in a manner all cloathed alike; it was
neither Black, White, Yellow, Red nor Blue, nor any Colour composed of
these: If you ask what was it then? I must tell you, it was a Colour
never seen in our earthly World, and so neither to be described nor
conceived by us; for as it is hard to make a Man born blind understand
the Difference between Green and Blue, so neither can I decypher this
Moon-colour, as having no Affinity with any I ever beheld; I can only
say it was the most glorious and delightful that can be imagined,
neither was any Thing more pleasant to me during my Stay there.

Being surprized at the Appearance of these People so suddenly and in
such Accoutrements, I crossed myself, and cried out, Jesu Maria: No
sooner was the Word Jesu pronounced, but Young and Old fell all on
their Knees (whereat I not a little rejoiced) holding up their Hands on
high, and repeating certain Words which I understood not; and relently
rising again, one much taller than the rest came and kindly embraced
me, and ordering, as I perceived, some of the rest to attend my Birds,
he took me by the Hand, and led me to his Dwelling, down toward the
Foot of the Hill, which was a Building so great and beautiful, as
nothing in our World is comparable thereto; yet afterward I saw such as
this seemed but a Cottage in respect of them, there was no Door about
the House less than thirty Foot high, and twelve broad, the Rooms were
forty or fifty Foot in Height, and answerable in Proportion neither
could they be much less, the Master thereof being full twenty-eight
high, and I suppose his Body would weigh twenty-five or thirty of ours:
After I had rested with him about one of our Days, he led me five
Leagues off to the Palace of the Prince of the Country, the Stateliness
whereof I have not now Leisure to describe; this Prince was much taller
than the former, and called (as near as I can by Letters declare it,
for their Sounds are not perfectly to be expressed by our Characters)
Pylonas, which in their Language is First or Chief, if it doth
not rather denote his Authority and Dignity, as being the Principal Man
in all those Parts; though yet there is one Supreme Monarch amongst
them, much greater of Stature than he, commanding over all that whole
World, having under him twenty-nine other Princes of great Power; and
every one of these has twenty-four inferior Governors, whereof this
Pylonas was one. The first Ancestor of this great Monarch came out
of the Earth, as they relate, and by marrying the Heiress of that
vast Monarchy obtaining the Government, left it to his Posterity, who
have enjoyed it ever since, even forty thousand Moons, which is 3077
Years: His Name was Irdonozur, whose Heirs to this Day assume the
same Name; he, they say, having continued there about four hundred
Moons, and begot divers Children, returned (though by what Means they
know not) to the Earth again. I doubt they have their Fables as well
as we, since our Historians never mention any earthly Man to have been
in that World before myself, and much less to have returned again. I
cannot therefore but condemn this Tradition as false and romantick,
though I found Learning was in great Esteem among them, and they seem
to detest Lying and Falshood, which is there severely punished, and
which may yield some Credit to their historical Narrations. Many of
them live wonderful long, even beyond Belief, affirming to me, that
some survived thirty thousand Moons, which is above a thousand Years,
so that the Ages of three or four Men might easily reach to the Time
of the first Irdonozur, and this is generally noted, that the taller
People are of Stature, the more excellent are their Endowments of Mind,
and the longer Time they live; for their Stature is very different,
great Numbers not much exceeding ours, who seldom live above a thousand
Moons, which is fourscore of our Years; these they account base,
unworthy Creatures, but one Degree above brute Beasts, and employ
in mean and servile Offices, calling them Bastards, Counterfeits or
Changlings: Those whom they account true Natural Lunars or Moon
Men, exceed ours generally thirty Times, both in Quantity of Body,
and Length of Life, proportionable to the Quality of the Day in both
Worlds, theirs containing almost thirty of our Days.

The manner of our Travel to the Palace of Pylonas was more strange
and incredible than any thing we have related, for at our first
setting forth there were delivered to each of us two Feather Fans,
like those our Ladies in Spain cool themselves with in Summer: You
must understand, that the Globe of the Moon has likewise an attractive
Power, yet so much weaker than the Earth, that if a Man do but spring
upward with all his Strength, as Dancers do in shewing their Tricks, he
will be able to mount fifty or sixty Foot high; and being then above
all Attraction from the Moon's Earth, he falls down no more, but by the
Help of these Fans, as with Wings, they convey themselves in the Air
in a short Space, (though not quite so swift as Birds) whither they
please. In two hours Time (as I could guess) by the Help of these Fans,
we were carried through the Air those five Leagues, in all about sixty
Persons. Being arrived at the Palace of Pylonas, after our Conductor
had declared what manner of Present he had brought, I was called in
to him by his Attendants: By the Stateliness of his Palace, and the
Reverence done him, I soon perceived his Greatness, and managed my
Affairs in order to procure his favour accordingly; and having, as you
may remember, a certain little Box or Casket of Jewels, the Remainder
of those I brought from the East-Indies, before I was introduced I
secretly took them out of my Pocket, and chusing some of each sort, I
made them ready to be presented as I should think convenient.

I found him sitting in a magnificent Chair of State, with his Wife or
Queen on one Hand, and his Eldest Son on the other, one attended by a
Troop of Ladies, and the other of young Men, and all along the Side of
the Room stood a great Number of handsome Personages, whereof scarce
one was lower of Stature than Pylonas, whose Age they report is now
one and twenty thousand Moons. At my Entrance I fell on my Knees, and
taking out my Jewels, I presented to the King seven Stones of several
Sorts, a Diamond, a Ruby, an Emerald, a Saphire, a Topaz and an Opal,
which he accepted with Joy and Admiration. Then I offered the Queen
and Prince some others, and designed to have bestowed divers more upon
his Attendants; but Pylonas forbid them to accept any, supposing,
as I heard, they were all I had, which he would have me reserve for
Irdonozur his Sovereign: He then embraced me with much Endearedness,
and enquired divers Things by Signs, which I answered in the same
manner to the best of my Skill; which not contenting him, he delivered
me to the Guard of 100 of his Giants as I may well call them, strictly
charging them, that I should want nothing fit for me; that they should
suffer none of the Dwarf Lunars, or little Moon Men, to come near
me. That I should be instructed in their Language, and lastly, that
they should by no Means impart to me the Knowledge of several Things by
him specified, what they were I could never understand. It may be you
long to know what Pylonas enquired of me: Why, what should it be but,
whence I came, how I arrived there what was my Name and Business, with
the like; to all which I answered as near the Truth as possible.

Being dismist, I was provided with all Necessaries as my Heart could
wish, so that I seemed to be in a Paradise, the Pleasures whereof did
not yet so transport me, but I was much concerned with the Thoughts
of my Wise and Children, and still retaining some Hope that I might
again return to them; I tended my Gansas daily with much Care, which
yet had signified little, if other Men had not done more than I could:
for now the Time came when of Necessity all People of our Stature, and
myself like wise, must needs sleep thirteen or fourteen whole Days
together; for by a Secret and irresistible Decree of Nature, when the
Day begins to appear, and the Moon to be enlightened by the Sun Beams,
which is in the first Quarter of the Moon, all People of our Stature
inhabiting these Parts fall into a dead Sleep, and are not possibly to
be awakened till the Sun set, and is withdrawn; for as Owls and Bats
with us cannot endure the Light, so at the first Approach of Day we
begin to be amazed therewith, and fall into a Slumber, which grows by
Degrees into a dead Sleep till the Light be gone, which is in fourteen
or fifteen Days, that is till the last Quarter. During the Sun's
Absence, there is a twofold Light, one of the Sun, which I could not
endure to behold, and another of the Earth: Now that of the Earth was
at the Height, for when the Moon is at the Change, then is the Earth a
full Moon to them, and as the Moon increaseth with us, so the Light of
the Earth decreaseth with them. I found the Light, though the Sun was
absent, equal to that with us in the Day when the Sun is clouded; but
toward the Quarter it daily diminisheth, yet leaving still a competent
Light, which seems very strange; though not so remarkable as what they
there report, that in the other Hemisphere of the Moon, contrary to
that I fell upon, where during half the Moon they see not the Sun, and
the Earth never appears to them, they have yet a kind of Light, not
unlike our Moon-Light, which it, seems the Nearness of the Stars, and
other Planets that are at a far less Distance than from us, affords
them.

You must understand, that of the true Lunars or Moon Men there
are three Kinds, some a little taller than we, as perhaps ten or
twelve foot high, these can endure the Day of the Moon, when the Earth
shines but little, but not the Beams of both, and so then must be
laid asleep: Others are twenty foot high or above, who can suffer all
the Light both of the Earth and Sun. There are in a certain Island
(the Mysteries whereof are carefully concealed) Men whose Stature
is at least twenty-seven foot high: If any other come to land there
in the Moon's Day time, they instantly fall asleep: This is called
Insula Martini, and hath a particular Governor, who as they report
is sixty-five thousand Moons old, which makes five thousand of our
Years; His Name is said to be Hiruch, and he in a manner commands
Irdonozur himself, especially in that Island out of which he never
removes: There is another comes often thither, who they say is not
above half his Age, that is about thirty-three thousand Moons, or two
thousand six hundred of our Years, and he orders all Things through the
Globe of the Moon in Matters of Religion, as absolutely as the Pope
doth in any Part of Italy; I would fain have seen this Man, but was
not permitted to come near him, his Name is Imozes.

Now let me settle myself to a long Night's Sleep, to which End my
Attendants take Charge of my Birds, prepare my Lodging, and signify
to me by Signs how I must order myself. It was then about the Middle
of September, when I perceived the Air more clear than ordinary,
and with the Increase of the Light I began to feel myself first dull
and then heavy to Sleep, though I had not been lately disturbed of my
Rest: At length I delivered myself into the Custody of this Sister of
Death, whose Prisoner I was for almost a fortnight after, and then
awaking, it is not to be believed how brisk and vigorous I found the
faculties both of my Body and Mind; I then applied myself to learning
the Language, which is the same throughout all the Regions of the Moon,
yet not so wonderful, since I believe all the Earth of the Moon does
not amount to the fortieth Part of our inhabited Earth, partly because
the Globe of the Moon is far less, and besides the Sea or Ocean covers
very nigh three Parts of four, whereas, the Land and Sea in our World
may be judged of an equal Measure. Their Language is very difficult,
since it hath no Affinity with any other I ever heard, and consists
not so much of Words and Letters, as Tunes and strange Sounds which
no Letters can express, for there are few Words but signify several
Things, and are distinguished only by their Sounds, which are sung as
it were in uttering; yea many Words consist of Tunes only, without
Words: By Occasion whereof I find a Language may be framed, and
easily learned, as copious as any other in the World only of Tunes,
which is an Experiment worth searching after: Notwithstanding these
Difficulties, within two Months I attained to such Knowledge therein,
that I understood most Questions demanded of me, and with Signs and
Words made reasonable Shift to utter my Mind; which Pylonas having
Notice of, he oft-times sent for me, and was pleased to inform me of
many Things my Guardians durst not disclose, though I must needs say I
never found they abused me with an Untruth, but if I asked a Question
they were unwilling to resolve, they would shake their Heads, and with
a Spanish Shrug divert to some other Discourse.

After seven Months Time the great Irdonozur, making his Progress to a
Place about two hundred Leagues from the Palace of Pylonas, sent for
me, yet would not admit me into his Presence, but discoursed me through
a Window, where I might hear him, and he hear and see me at Pleasure. I
presented him the Remainder of my Jewels, which he thankfully accepted,
saying, he would requite them with Gifts of a far more considerable
Value. I stayed there above a Quarter of a Moon, when I was again sent
back to Pylonas, for if we had stayed a Day or two longer the Sun
would have overtaken us before we could have recovered our Home. The
Gifts he bestowed on me were such, that a Man would part with Mountains
of Gold to purchase; they were all Stones, nine only in Number, of
three Sorts, one called Poleastis, another Machrus, and the third
Ebelus, of each Sort three; the first are about the Bigness of an
Hazle-nut, very like Jet, which among many other incredible Virtues
hath this Property, that being once put in the fire they ever after
retain their Heat, though without any outward Appearance, till quenched
with some kind of Liquor, which no way endamages them, though heated
and cooled therein a thousand Times; their Heat is so vehement, that
it will make any Metal within a foot of it red hot, and being in a
Chimney warms the Room as if a great fire were kindled therein. The
Machrus is yet more precious, in Colour like a Topaz, so clear
and resplendent, as though not above the Bigness of a Bean, yet being
placed in the Night in the midst of a large Church, it makes all as
light as if an hundred Lamps were hanged round; can any Man wish for
more useful Properties in a Stone than these? Yet my Ebelus is so
excellent, that it may be much preferred before them, yea prized above
all the Diamonds, Sapphires, Rubies, and Emeralds that our World can
afford. The Lunar Colour is so exceeding beautiful, that a Man would
travel a thousand Leagues to behold it, the Shape is somewhat flat, of
the Breadth of a Piece of Eight, and twice the Thickness, one Side is
of a more orient Colour than the other, which being clapt to a Man's
bare Skin, takes away all the Weight and Ponderousness of his Body,
but turning the other Side, it adds force to the attractive Beams of
the Earth either in this World or that, and makes the Body half as
heavy again: Do you wonder now, why I should so overprize this Stone?
Before you see me on Earth again, you will find I have Reason to value
this invaluable Jewel. I enquired, whether they had not any kind of
Jem, or other Means to make a Man invisible, which I judged a Thing
of admirable Use, and could mention divers of our learned Men who had
written to this Purpose; they answered, that if it were possible,
yet they were sure Heaven would not suffer it to be revealed to us
Creatures subject to so many Imperfections, and which might be easily
abused to ill Purposes, and this was all I could get of them.

Now after it was known that Irdonozur the great Monarch had done me
this Honour, it is strange how much all respected me more than before;
my Guardians, who had been hitherto cautious in relating any thing of
the Government of that World, grew now more open, so that from them
and Pylonas together I understood many notable Particulars; as that
in a thousand Years there is found neither Thief nor Whore-monger, for
first there is no want of any thing necessary for the Use of Man, food
growing every where without Labour, of all Sorts that can be desired.
As for Cloths, Houses, or whatever else a Man may be supposed to want,
it is provided by their Superiors, though not without some Labour,
but yet so easy as if they did it for Pleasure: Again, their Females
are all absolute Beauties, and by a secret Disposition of Nature, a
Man there having once known a Woman never desires any other: Murther
was never heard of amongst them, neither is it hardly possible to be
committed, for there can be no Wound made but what is curable; yea
they assured me, and for my Part I believe it, that though a Man's
Head be cut off, yet if within three Moons it be joined to the Carcase
again, and the Juice of a certain Herb there growing applied, it will
be so consolidated, as the wounded Party shall be perfectly cured. But
the chief Cause of their good Government is an excellent Disposition
in the Nature of the People, so that all both Old and Young hate all
manner of Vice, and live in such Love, Peace, and Amity, as it seems
to be another Paradise: Though it is true likewise that some are of
a better Disposition than others, which they discern immediately at
their Birth; and because it is an inviolable Law amongst them that none
shall be put to Death; therefore perceiving by their Stature or some
other Signs, who are like to be of a wicked and debauched Humour, they
send them, I know not by what Means, into the Earth, and change them
for other Children, before they have either Opportunity or Ability to
do amiss among them; but first, they say, they are fain to keep them
there for some Time, till the Air of the Earth alters their Colour like
ours. Their ordinary Vent for them is a certain high Hill in the North
of America, whose People, I am apt to believe, are wholly descended
from them, both in regard of their Colour, and their continual use
of Tobacco, which the Lunars or Moon Men smoak exceedingly, the
Place abounding much with Moisture, together with the Pleasure they
take therein, and some other Respects too long to rehearse: Sometimes,
though but seldom, they mistake their Aim, and fall upon Europe,
Asia, or Africa. I remember some Years since I read certain Stories
tending to confirm what is related by these Lunars, and especially
one Chapter of Neubrigensis. Inigo Mondejar, in his Description
of Nova Granata. Also Joseph Desia de Carana, in his History of
Mexico, if my Memory fail not, recount what will make my Report more
creditable; but I value not Testimonies.

If you enquire how Justice is executed, alas, what need is there of
exemplary Punishment where no Offences are committed, neither need
they any Lawyers, for there is no Contention, the Seeds whereof, when
they begin to sprout, are by the Wisdom of the next Superior pluckt up
by the Roots. And as little Want is there of Physicians, they never
surfeit themselves; the Air is always pure and temperate, neither
is there any Cause of Sickness, I could never hear of any that were
distempered. But the Time assigned them by Nature being spent, they
die without the least Pain, or rather cease to live, as a Candle does
to give Light when what nourishes it is consumed. I was once at the
Departure of one of them, and was much surprized, that notwithstanding
the happy Life he lived, and the Multitude of friends and Children he
should forsake, yet as soon as he understood his End to approach, he
prepared a great feast, and inviting all whom "he esteemed, exhorts
them, to be merry and rejoice with him, since the Time was come he
should now leave the counterfeit Pleasures of that World, and be made
Partaker of all true Joy and perfect Happiness."

I did not so much admire his own Constancy, as the Behaviour of his
friends: With us in the like Case all seem to mourn, when many of them
do oft but laugh in their Sleeves, or under a Vizard. But here all
both Young and Old did, in my Conscience, not pretendedly, but really
rejoice thereat, and if any dissembled, it was only Grief for their
own particular Loss. Being dead their Bodies putrify not, and so are
not buried, but kept in certain Rooms appointed to that Purpose, so
that most of them can shew their Ancestors Bodies uncorrupt for many
Generations: There is never any Rain, Wind, or change of Weather, never
either Summer or Winter, but as it were a perpetual Spring, yielding
all Pleasure and Content, free from the least Trouble or Annoyance; O
my Wife and Children, what Wrong have you done me to bereave me of the
Happiness of that Place! But it is no great Matter, for by this Voyage
I am sufficiently assured, that when the Race of my mortal Life is run,
I shall attain a greater Happiness elsewhere.

It was the ninth of September that I began to ascend from the Pike
of Teneriff; twelve Days I was upon my Voyage, and arrived in that
Province of the Moon called Simiri, Sept. 21. May 12, we came to
the Court of the great Irdonozur, and returned back the 17th to
the Palace of Pylonas, where I continued till March 1601. When
I earnestly requested Pylonas, as I had oft done before, to give
me Leave to depart, tho' with Hazard of my Life, back into the Earth
again. He dissuaded me, insisting on the Danger of the Voyage, the
Misery of that Place from whence I came, and the abundant Happiness I
now enjoyed; but the Remembrance of my Wife and Children, outweighed
all these Reasons, and to say the Truth, I was so elated with a Desire
of the Glory I should purchase at my Return, as methought I deserved
not the Name of a Spaniard, if I would not hazard twenty Lives rather
than lose the least Particle thereof. I replied I had so strong a
Desire to see my Children, that I could not possibly live any longer
without going to them: He then requested me to stay one Year longer;
I told him, I must needs depart now or never, my Birds began to droop
for want of their usual Voyage, three were already dead, and if a few
more failed, I was destitute of all Possibility of Return. At length
with much Solliciting I prevailed, having first acquainted the great
Irdonozur with my Intentions, and perceiving by the often baying of
my Birds a great Longing in them to be gone, I trimmed up my Engine,
and took my Leave of Pylonas, and March 29, three Days after my
waking from, the last Moon's Light, I fastened myself to my Engine,
not forgetting to take the Jewels Irdonozur had given me, with the
Virtues and Use whereof Pylonas had acquainted me at large, with a
small Quantity of Victuals, whereof afterward I had great Occasion.
A vast Multitude of People being present, and among them Pylonas
himself, after I had given them all the last Farewel, I let loose
the Reins to my Birds, who with much Greediness taking Wing, quickly
carried me out of Sight; it happened to me as in my first Passage,
for I never felt either Hunger or Thirst till I fell upon an high
Mountain in China, about five Leagues from the High and Mighty City
of Pequin. This Voyage was performed in less than nine Days, neither
heard I any News of these airy Men I met with in my ascending; nothing
stayed me in my Journey, whether because of the earnest Desire of my
Birds to return to the Earth, having already missed their Season, or
that the Attraction of the Earth was so much stronger than that of the
Moon, and so made it easier, yet so it was, though I had three Birds
less than before. For the first eight Days my Birds flew before me, and
I on the Engine was as it were drawn after; but the ninth Day, when I
began to approach the Clouds, I perceived myself and Engine to sink
toward the Earth, and go before them. I was then horribly afraid, least
my Birds unable to bear our Weight, being so few, should be constrained
to precipitate both me and themselves headlong to the Earth, and
thought it very necessary to make use of my Stone Ebelus, which I
clapt to my bare Skin within my Clothes, and instantly I perceived my
Birds made way with greater Ease than before, as seeming freed from a
great Burthen, neither do I think they could possibly have let me down
safely to the Earth without that Help.

China is a Country so populous, that I think there is scarce a Piece
of Ground thrice a Man's Length which is not carefully manured: I being
yet in the Air, some of the Country People spying me came running by
Troops, and seized me, would needs carry me before a Magistrate, and
seeing no other Remedy I yielded to them. But when I tried to go I
found myself so light, that one foot being on the Ground I had much
ado to set down the other, which was by reason my Ebelus took all
Weight away from my Body, therefore I pretended a Desire of performing
the Necessities of Nature; which being made known to them by Signs,
for they understood not a Word of any Language I could speak, they
permitted me to go aside among a few Bushes, assuring themselves it
was impossible I should escape from them; being there, I remembred
Pylonas his Directions about the Use of my Stones, and knit them up,
with a few remaining Jewels, into an Handkerchief, all except the least
and worst Ebelus, which I found Means to apply in such Manner to my
Body, that but the half of its Side touched my Skin; this done I drew
toward my Guardians, till coming so near that they could not cross my
Way, I shewed them a fair Pair of Heels, that I might have Time to hide
my Jewels, which I knew they would have robbed me of if not prevented.
Being thus lightened I led them such a Dance, that had they been all
upon the Backs of so many Race-Horses they could never have overtaken
me; I directed my Course to a thick Wood, wherein I entered about a
Quarter of a League, and there finding a fine Spring, which I took for
my Mark, I thrust my Jewels into a Hole made by a Mole hard by.

I then took my Victuals out of my Pocket, to which till now in
all my Voyage I had not the least Appetite, and refreshed myself
therewith, till the People who pursued overtook me, into whole Hands
I quietly surrendered myself; they led me to an inferior Officer, who
understanding that I escaped from those who first apprehended me,
caused an Inclosure of Boards to be made, wherein they put me, so that
only my Head was at Liberty, and then carried me upon the Shoulders of
sour Slaves, like some notorious Malefactor, before a Person of great
Authority, who in their Language I learnt, was called a Mandarin,
and resided a League off the famous City of Pequin. I could not
understand them, but found I was accused for something with much
Vehemence, the Substance of this Accusation it seems was, that I was
a Magician, as appeared by my being so strangely carried in the Air,
and that being a Stranger, as both my Language and Habit did declare,
I contrary to the Laws of China had entered the Kingdom without a
Warrant, and probably for no good Intent. The Mandarin heard them
with a great deal of Gravity, and being a Man of quick Apprehension,
and studious of Novelties, he told them he would take such Order as the
Case required, and my bold Attempt should not go unpunished: Having
dismist them, he ordered his Servants I should be kept in a remote
Pare of his vast Palace, be strictly guarded, and kindly used; this I
conjecture by my Treatment, and what followed, for my Accommodation
was much better than I could expect, I lodged well, eat well, was
well attended, and could complain of nothing but my Restraint; Thus
continued I many Months, afflicted more with the Thoughts of my
Gansas than any Thing else, who I knew must be irrecoverably lost, as
indeed they were.

In this Time by my own Industry, and the Assistance of those who
accompanied me, I learnt to speak indifferently the Language of that
Province, (for almost every Province in China hath its proper Tongue)
whereat I perceived they were much pleased: At length I was permitted
to take the Air, and brought into the spacious Garden of that Palace,
a Place of extraordinary Pleasure and Delight, adorned with Herbs and
Flowers of admible Sweetness and Beauty, with almost infinite Variety
of fruits, European and others, all composed with that rare Curiosity,
as even ravished my Senses in the Contemplation of such delightful
Objects; I had not long recreated myself here, when the Mandarin
entered the Garden on that Side I was walking, of which having Notice
by his Servants, and that I ought to kneel to him (a usual Reverence I
found toward great Officers) I did so, and humbly intreated his savour
toward a poor Stranger, who arrived in these Parts not designedly,
but by the secret Disposal of the Heavens, he answered in a different
Language which I hear all the Mandarins use, and like that of the
Lunars consisting chiefly of Tunes, which was interpreted by one of
his Attendants, wishing me to be of good Comfort, since he intended
no Harm to me. Next Day I was ordered to come before him, and being
conducted into a noble Dining-room exquisitely painted, the Mandarin
commanding all to avoid, vouchsafed to confer with me in the vulgar
Language, enquiring into the State of my Country, the Power of my
Prince, and the Religion and Manners of the People; wherein having
satisfied him, he asked me about my Education, and what brought me
into this remote Country; I then declared to him the Adventures of my
Life, omitting what I thought convenient, and especially forbearing to
mention the Stories given me by Irdonozur.

The Strangeness of my Story did much amaze him, and finding in all my
Discourse nothing tending to Magick, wherein he hoped by my Means to
be intruded, he began to admire the Excellency of my Wit, applauding
me for the happiest Man that this World ever saw, and wishing me to
repose myself after my long Narration, he for that Time dismissed me.
After which the Mandarin took so much Delight in me, that no Day
passed wherein he did not fend for me: At length he advised me to
cloath myself in the Habit of that Country, which I willingly did,
and gave me not only the Liberty of his House, but took me also with
him when he went to Pequin, whereby I had Opportunity to learn the
Disposition of the People, and the Policy of the Country, neither did
I by my Attendance on him, gain only the Knowledge of these Things,
but the Possibility likewise of being restored to my native Soil, and
to those dear Pledges which I value above the World, even my Wise and
Children: for by often frequenting Pequin, I at length heard of some
fathers of the Society of Jesus, who were become famous for their
extraordinary savour with the King, to whom they had presented some
European, as Clocks, Watches, Dials, and the like, which by them were
counted exquisite Curiosities. To these by the Mandarin's Leave I
repaired, and was welcomed by them, they much wondering to see a Lay
Spaniard there, whither they had with so much Difficulty obtained
Leave to arrive. There did I relate to father Pontoja and others of
the Society the forementioned Adventures, by whose Directions I put
them in Writing, and sent this Story of my fortunes to Macoa, from
thence to be conveyed to Spain, as a forerunner of my Return; and
the Mandarin being indulgent to me, I came often to the Fathers,
with whom I consulted about many Secrets, and with them also laid the
Foundation of my Return, the blessed Hour whereof I do with Patience
expect, that by enriching my Country with the Knowledge of these hidden
Mysteries, I may at last reap the Glory of my fortunate Misfortunes.

A Journey of several English Merchants from Oratava in Teneriff,
one of the Canary Islands on the Coast of Africa, to the top of the
Pike in that Island, with the Observations they made there.

Mention being made in the preceding Story of the Pike of Teneriff,
it may be some Diversion to insert the following little Journey
performed by divers Englishmen a few Years since to the Top, who
published the following Account thereof.

The Pike of Teneriff is thought not to have its Equal in the World
for Height, its Top being so much above the Clouds, that in clear
Weather it may be seen sixty Dutch Leagues at Sea.

It cannot be ascended but in July and August, lying all the other
Months covered with Snow, though upon this and the near adjacent
Islands none is to be seen: It requires three Days travel to come
to the top: The Merchants and other worthy Persons who undertook
this Journey proceed thus. Having furnished ourselves with a Guide,
Servants, and Horses to carry our Wine and Provision, we set forth
from Oratava, a Port Town in the Island of Teneriff, situate on
the North Side, two Mile distant from the main Sea, and travelled from
twelve at Night till eight in the Morning, by which Time we got to the
Top of the first Mountain toward the Pico de Terraira; there under a
very large and conspicuous Pine Tree we took our Breakfast, dined, and
refresht ourselves till two in the Afternoon. Then we passed through
many sandy Ways, over many lofty Mountains, but naked and bare, and not
covered with Pine Trees as our first Night's Passage was; this exposed
us to excessive Heat, till we arrived to the Foot of the Pico, where
we found divers huge Stones, which seemed to have fallen from some
upper Part: About six in the Evening we began to ascend up the Pico,
but were scarce advanced a Mile, when the Way being no more passable
for Horses, we left them with our Servants. In the Ascent of one Mile,
some of our Company grew very saint and sick, disordered by fluxes,
Vomitings, and agueish Distempers, our Horses Hair standing up like
Bristles, and calling for some of our Wine carried in small Barrels on
an Horse, we found it so wonderfully cold, that we could not drink it
till we had made a fire to warm it, notwithstanding the Air was very
calm and moderate, but when the Sun was set, it began to blow with such
Violence, and grew so cold, that taking up our Lodging among the hollow
Rocks, we were necessitated to keep fires in the Mouths of them all
Night.

About four in the Morning we began to mount again, and being come
another Mile up, one of our Company failed and was able to proceed
no further: Here began the black Rocks; the rest of us pursued our
Journey till we came to the Sugar Loaf, where we began to travel
again in a white Sand, being fitted with Shoes, whose single Soles
are made a finger broader than the upper Leathers, to encounter this
difficult Passage: Having ascended as far the black Rocks, which lay
all flat like a plain floor, we climbed within a Mile of the very Top
of the Pico, and at last we attained the Summit, where we found no
such Smoak as appeared a little below, but a continual Perspiration
of a hot and sulphureous Vapour that made our faces extremely sore;
all this way we found no considerable Alteration of the Air, and very
little Wind, but on the Top it was so impetuous, that we had much ado
to stand against it whilst we drank K. Charles II. Health, and fired
each of us a Gun. Here also we took our Dinner, but found that our
strong Waters had lost their Virtue, and were almost insipid, while our
Wine was more brisk and spirituous than before: The Top on which we
stood being not above a Yard broad, is the Brink of a Pit called the
Caldera, which we judged to be a Musket Shot over, and near fourscore
Yards deep, in form of a Cone, hollow within like a Kettle, and covered
over with small loose Stones mixed with Sulphur and Sand, from among
which issued divers Spiracles of Smoak and Heat, which being stirred
with any Thing puffs and makes a Noise, and is so offensive, that we
were even suffocated with the sudden rising of Vapors, upon removing
one of these Stones, which were so hot as not easily to be handled; we
descended not above sour or five Yards into the Caldera or Caldron,
because of the Slipperiness under foot, and the Difficulty; but some
have adventured to the Bottom: Other Matters observable we discovered
none, besides a clear sort of Sulphur which lay like Salt upon the
Stones: from this renowned Pico we could see the Grand Canaries
fourteen Leagues, distant, Palma eighteen, and Gomera seven,
which Interval of Sea seemed not much wider than the Thames about
London; we discerned also the Herro, being distant about twenty
Leagues, and so to the utmost Limits of the Sea much farther: As soon
as the Sun appeared, the Shadow of the Pico seemed to cover not only
the whole Island and the Grand Canaries, but the Sea to the very
Horizon, where the Top of the Sugar-Loaf or Pico visibly appeared
to turn up, and cast its Shade into the Air itself, at which we were
much surprized.

But the Sun was not far ascended when the Clouds began to rise so fast,
as intercepted our Prospect both of the Sea and the whole Island,
except the Tops only of the subjacent Mountains, which seemed to pierce
them through; whether these Clouds do ever surmount the Pico we
cannot say, but to such as are far below they seem sometimes to hang
above it, or rather wrap themselves about it, constantly when the West
Winds blow; this they call the Cap, and is an infallible Prognostick
of ensuing Storms: One of our Company who made this Journey again two
Years after, arriving at the Top of the Pico before Day, and creeping
under a great Stone to shroud himself from the cold Air, after a little
Space found himself all wet, and perceived it to come from a perpetual
trickling of the Water from the Rocks above him: Many excellent and
exuberant Springs we found issuing from the Tops of most of the other
Mountains, gushing out in great Spouts, almost as far as the huge Pine
Tree we mentioned before; having stayed a while at the Top, we all
descended the sandy Way till we came to the foot of the Sugar-Loaf
which being steep even almost to a Perpendicular we soon parted, and
here we met with a Cave about ten Yards deep and fifteen broad, being
in Shape like an Oven or Cupola, having a Hole at the Top near eight
Yards over; this we descended by a Rope that our Servants held fast on
the Top, while with the other End being fastened about our Middles we
swung ourselves, till being over a Bank of Snow we slid down, lighting
upon it; we were forced to swing thus in the Descent, because in the
Midst of the Bottom of this Cave opposite to the Overture at the Top,
is a round Pit of Water like a Well, the surface whereof is about a
Yard lower, but as wide as the Mouth at Top, and about six fathom deep;
we supposed this Water was not a Spring, but dissolved Snow blown in,
or Water trickling through the Rocks; about the Sides of the Grott for
some Height there is Ice and Isicles hanging down to the Snow.

But being quickly weary of this excessive cold Place, and drawn up
again, we continued our Descent from the Mountains by the fame Passage
we went up the Day before, and so about five in the Evening arrived at
Oratava, from whence we set forth; our Faces were so red and sore
that to cool them we were forced to wash and bathe them in whites of
Eggs: The whole Height of the Pico in Perpendicular is vulgarly
esteemed to be two Miles and an half. No Trees, Herbs nor Shrubs did
we find in all the Passage, but Pines, and among the whiter Sands a
kind of Broom being a bushy Plant: It is the Opinion of some ingenious
Persons who have lived twenty Years upon the Place, that the whole
Island being a Soil mightily impregnated with Brimstone, did in former
Times take Fire, and blow up all or near all at the same Time; and that
many Mountains of huge Stones calcined and burnt, which appear all over
this Island, especially in the South-West Part of it, were cast up
and raised out of the Bowels of the Earth at the Time of that general
Conflagration; and that the greatest Quantity of this Sulphur lying
about the Center of the Island raised up the Pico to that Height at
which it now is seen; which appears by the Situation of those Rocks
that lye three or four Miles round the Bottom of the Pico, and in
such Order one above another almost to the Sugar-Loaf, as it is
called, as if the whole ground swelling and rising up together by the
Ascension of the Brimstone, the Torrents and Rivers of it did with a
sudden Eruption roul and tumble them down from the rest of the Rocks;
especially to the South-West, where from the Top of the Pico to the
Sea coast lie huge Heaps of these burnt Rocks one under another, and
there still remain the very Tracks of the Brimstone Rivers as they
ran over this Quarter, of the Island which Hath so wasted the Ground,
beyond Recovery, that nothing can be made to grow there but Broom.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
