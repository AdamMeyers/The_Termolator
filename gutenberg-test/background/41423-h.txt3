THE CUBIES        ABC
DEDICATED by THE CUBIES
to
The ASSOCIATION of AMERICAN PAINTERS and SCULPTORS
    TO WHICH THEY OWE THEIR INCUBATION    














THE CUBIES       







A is for Art in the Cubies        domain       
(Not the Art of the Ancients, brand-new are the Cubies.)
Archipenko       s their guide, Anatomics their bane;
They       re the joy of the mad, the despair of the sane,
(With their emerald hair and their eyes red as rubies.)
       A is for Art in the Cubies        domain.











B is for Beauty as Brancusi views it.
(The Cubies all vow he and Braque take the Bun.)
First you seize all that       s plain to the eye, then you lose it;
Next you search for the Soul and proceed to abuse it.
(They tell me it       s easy and no end of fun.)
       B is for Beauty as Brancusi views it.










C is for Color Cubistic ad libitum       
(Orange and blue, yellow, purple and green.)
       Throw them all on your boards,        Cubies say,        then exhibit        em!       
There       ll be no colors left, if we don       t soon prohibit        em!
(Watch them at work and you       ll see what I mean.)
       C is for Color Cubistic ad libitum.










D is for Duchamp, the Deep-Dyed Deceiver,
Who, drawing accordeons, labels them stairs,
With a lady that must have been done in a fever,       
His model won       t see her, we trust, it would grieve her!       
(Should the stairway collapse, Cubie       s good at repairs.)
       D is for Duchamp, the Deep-Dyed Deceiver.










E             s for the Ego, intense and Exotic,
Enjoyed by a Cubie, and quaintly Expressed
In a lachrymose face with a gaze idiotic
When seen on the canvas.       It       s really Quixotic
To offer one       s soul to the Cubical test!
       E       s for the Ego, intense and Exotic.










F             s for the Future for which Cubies hanker;       
To Hals, Perugino and all that old crew
They give up the Past without envy or rancor,
While saying in tones than which naught could be franker:
       Come, move on,       it       s our turn! They have finished with you.       
       F       s for the Future for which Cubies hanker.










G is for Gertrude Stein       s limpid lucidity,
(Eloquent scribe of the Futurist soul.)
Cubies devour each word with avidity:
       Alone words lack sense,        they affirm with placidity,
       But how wise we       ll be when we       ve swallowed the whole!       
       G is for Gertrude Stein       s limpid lucidity.










H is for Henri       s young Red Top, the shaver
Whom Cubies regard with aversion and spite.
His life-like appearance has won their disfavor:
       He might walk right out of the picture!        they quaver,       
       Why, only to think of it fills us with fright!       
       H is for Henri       s young Red Top the shaver.










I             s for the Cubies        Immense Intuition,       
       The only real need of an artist,        they say:
       Without it we all would go straight to perdition!       
Between you and me, I       ve a sneaking suspicion
The Cubies themselves appear well on the way!
       I       s for the Cubies        Immense Intuition.










J             s for the Jam in the Cubies        headquarters,
And the Jar that they gave us, the first time we met;
And that same Jar of Jam from across the blue waters
Is quite unexcelled among those the importers
Have wafted us over the ocean as yet.
       J       s for the Jam in the Cubies        headquarters.










K             s for Kandinsky       s Kute        improvisations              
The Kubies abound in delight for his art:
They say there       s a Klue to his Kryptic Kreations.
By means of Picabia       s deep ratiocinations
Some day we may really decipher his heart.
       K       s for Kandinsky       s Kute        improvisations.       










L is for Life that is        still,        as they name it,
Or        nature        that       s        dead,        as you readily see.
When you think how it       s treated, you really can       t blame it.
You       d wish, in it       s place, you were dead. Just the same it
Is shocking how cruel the Cubies can be!
       L is for Life that is        still,        as they name it.










M             s for Matisse       s Mam       selle Marguerite,
(With whom all the Cubies are madly in love;)
Her manner is so prepossessing and sweet
That, if she but had them, we       d fall at her feet!
(In her eyes, what a mingling of serpent and dove!)
       M       s for Matisse       s Mam       selle Marguerite.










N             s for the Nudes that the Cubies portray,       
We willingly vouch for their perfect propriety,
Even while some we regard with dismay,       
For instance, the lady as long as Broadway:
With all due respect, we don       t crave her society!
       N       s for the Nudes that the Cubies portray.










O             s for Objective and Optical Art,
(The kind we       ve been used to, these long years gone by,)
Which the Cubie Objects to with all of his heart:
       Make the Object Subjective,        he says,        at the start,       
Just a matter of Grammar, as easy as pie!       
       O       s for Objective and Optical Art.










P             s for Picasso, Picabia and Party
(Who deal in abstractions, distractions and such.)
When, with vision chaotic and expletives hearty,
You beg of a Cubie their sense to impart, he
Profoundly makes answer:        In little is much.       
       P       s for Picasso, Picabia and Party.










Q             s for the Queerness we Stand-patters feel
When Progressive young Cubies start Art reformation.
They       re strong on Initiative, praise the Square Deal:
       Though the Cubic is best!        they aggressively squeal;
       Painting things as you see them is rank deformation!       
       Q       s for the Queerness we Stand-patters feel.










R is for Reason and poor old Reality,
Once in the fashion, but now obsolete,
Banished forever with grim actuality.
Now the sole law is one       s own personality       
Find its Cube Root and you have it complete.
       R is for Reason and poor old Reality.










S is for Schamberg       s fair dame at her        phone,
Conversing with G. Stein, the Futurist scribe.
The Cubies, eavesdropping, hear Gertrude bemoan:
       This one feeling many far seeming alone,
The bluer the bliss the redder the bribe!       
       S is for Schamberg       s fair dame at her        phone.










T             s for the Type of Tree Chabaud       s erected.
The Cubies insist it       s as useful as fair
For a game that they play when they       re feeling dejected,
(A use which not every one would have detected,)
Lassoing the branches with rings of their hair.
       T       s for the Type of Tree Chabaud       s erected.










U             s for the Union so Utterly Useless
Uniting the members that make up the whole.
Against it the Cubies wage war that is truceless:
       Such rage for convention,        they cry,        is excuseless!
Away with cohesion, and set free the Soul!       
       U       s for the Union so Utterly Useless.










V is for Villon       s musicianly lady
(With charm evanescent and Visage remote.)
The picnics he gives in his orchards so shady
Account for his hit with the Cubes. I       m afraid he
Will spoil them completely for plain table d       h       te.
       V is for Villon       s musicianly lady.










W             s for Woolworth, the building so stable,
(Erected with nickels and dimes by us all,)
Which Cubies paint writhing from cellar to gable,
Distinctly resembling the Tower of Babel,
Some decades ago, just preceding its fall.
       W       s for Woolworth, the building so stable.










X is the Xit, Xtremely alluring
When Cubies invite us to study their Art;
And the Xquisite pain we are sadly enduring
The while they protest, with an air reassuring:
       Of course this is merely a diffident start!       
       X is the Xit, Xtremely alluring.










Y             s for the Yawn overcoming each Cubie
At sight of a painting not done in his style:
       If a man doesn       t use all the colors, from ruby
To sapphire and emerald and topaz       the booby!       
To look at his canvas is not worth one       s while!       
       Y       s for the Yawn overcoming each Cubie.










Z is for Zak       s summer-time composition;
The Cubies regard his plump hills with delight.
They are somewhat fatigued after this exhibition
And tempted to slumber; so, with your permission,
We       ll tuck them in snugly and bid them goodnight.
       Z is for Zak       s summer-time composition.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
