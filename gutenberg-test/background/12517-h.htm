        no room to publish the glossary, we can only appeal to the
        indulgence of our readers. The story itself was written in
        a very clear, legible hand, and was enclosed in a wrapper
        labelled, "Arcadia Mixture. Strength and Aroma combined.

    <h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

    <p>We were all sitting on the pig-sty at T'NOWHEAD'S Farm. A
    pig-sty is not, perhaps, a strictly eligible seat, but there
    were special reasons, of which you shall hear something later,
    for sitting on this particular pig-sty.</p>

    <p>The old sow was within, extended at full length.
    Occasionally she grunted approval of what was said, but, beyond
    that, she seemed to show but a faint interest in the
    proceedings. She had been a witness of similar gatherings for
    some years, and, to tell the truth, they had begun to bore her,
    but, on the whole, I am not prepared to deny that her
    appreciation was an intelligent one. Behind us was the brae.
    Ah, that brae! Do you remember how the child you once were sat
    in the brae, spinning the peerie, and hunkering at I-dree
    I-dree I droppit-it? Do you remember that? Do you even know
    what I mean? Life is like that. When we are children the bread
    is thick, and the butter is thin; as we grow to be lads and
    lassies, the bread dwindles, and the butter increases; but the
    old men and women who totter about the commonty, how shall they
    munch when their teeth are gone? That's the question. I'm a
    Dominie. What!&mdash;no answer? Go to the bottom of the class,
    all of you.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

    <p>As I said, we were all on the pig-sty. Of the
    <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> I scarcely need to speak to you, since
    you must know their names, even if you fail to pronounce them.
    But there was a stranger amongst us, a stranger who, it was
    said, had come from London. Yesterday when I went ben the house
    I found him sitting with JESS; to-day, he too, was sitting with
    us on the pig-sty. There were tales told about him, that he
    wrote for papers in London, and stuffed his vases and his
    pillows with money, but TAMMAS HAGGART only shook his head at
    what he called "such auld fowks' yeppins," and evidently didn't
    believe a single word. Now TAMMAS, you must know, was our
    humorist. It was not without difficulty that TAMMAS had
    attained to this position, and he was resolved to keep it.
    Possibly he scented in the stranger a rival humorist whom he
    would have to crush. At any rate, his greeting was not marked
    with the usual genial cordiality characteristic of Scotch
    weavers, and many were the anxious looks exchanged amongst us,
    as we watched the preparations for the impending conflict.</p>

    <h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

    <p>After TAMMAS had finished boring half-a-dozen holes in the
    old sow with his sarcastic eye, he looked up, and addressed
    HENDRY MCQUMPHA.</p>

    <p>"HENDRY," he said, "ye ken I'm a humorist, div ye no?"</p>

    <p>HENDRY scratched the old sow meditatively, before he
    answered.</p>

    <p>"Ou ay," he said, at length. "I'm no saying 'at ye're no a
    humorist. I ken fine ye're a sarcesticist, but there's other
    humorists in the world, am thinkin."</p>

    <p>This was scarcely what TAMMAS had expected. HENDRY was
    usually one of his most devoted admirers. There was an awkward
    silence which made me feel uncomfortable. I am only a poor
    Dominie, but some of my happiest hours had been passed on the
    pig-sty. Were these merry meetings to come to an end? PETE took
    up the talking.</p>

    <p>"HENDRY, my man," he observed, as he helped himself out of
    TAMMAS'S snuff-mull, "ye're ower kyow-owy. Ye ken humour's a
    thing 'at spouts out o' its ain accord, an' there's no nae
    spouter in Thrums 'at can match wi' TAMMAS."</p>

    <p>He looked defiantly at HENDRY, who was engaged in searching
    for coppers in his north-east-by-east-trouser pocket. T'NOWHEAD
    said nothing, and HOOKEY was similarly occupied. At last, the
    stranger spoke.</p>

    <p>"Gentlemen," he began, "may I say a word? I may lay claim to
    some experience in the matter. I travel in humour, and
    generally manage to do a large business."</p>

    <p>He looked round interrogatively. TAMMAS eyed him with one of
    his keen glances. Then he worked his mouth round and round to
    clear the course for a sarcasm.</p>

    <p>"So you're the puir crittur," said the stone-breaker, "'at's
    meanin' to be a humorist."</p>

    <p>This was the challenge. We all knew what it meant, and fixed
    our eyes on the stranger.</p>

    <p>"Certainly," was his answer; "that is exactly my meaning. I
    trust I make myself plain, I'm willing to meet any man at
    catch-weights. Now here, he continued," are some of my samples.
    This story about a house-boat, for instance, has been much
    appreciated. It's almost in the style of Mr. JEROME'S
    masterpiece; or this screamer about my wife's tobacco-pipe and
    the smoking mixture. "Observe," he went on, holding the sample
    near to his mouth, "I can expand it to any extent. Puff, puff!
    Ah! it has burst. No matter, these accidents sometimes happen
    to the best regulated humorists. Now, just look at these," he
    produced half-a-dozen packets rapidly from his bundle. "Here we
    have a packet of sarcasm&mdash;equal to dynamite. I left it on
    the steps of the Savile Club, but it missed fire somehow. Then
    here are some particularly neat things in cheques. I use them
    myself to paper my bedroom. It's simpler and easier than
    cashing them, and besides," adjusting his mouth to his sleeve,
    and laughing, "it's quite killing when you come to think of it
    in that way. Lastly, there's this banking-account sample,
    thoroughly suitable for journalists and children. You see how
    it's done. I open it, you draw on it. Oh, you don't want a
    drawing-master, any fellow can do it, and the point is it never
    varies. Now," he concluded, aggressively, "what have you got to
    set against that, my friend?"</p>

    <p>We all looked at TAMMAS. HENDRY kicked the pail towards him,
    and he put his foot on it. Thus we knew that HEHDRY had
    returned to his ancient allegiance, and that the stranger would
    be crushed. Then TAMMAS began&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Man, man, there's no nae doubt at ye lauoh at havers, an'
    there's mony 'at lauchs 'at your clipper-clapper, but they're
    no Thrums fowk, and they canna' lauch richt. But we maun juist
    settle this matter. When we're ta'en up wi' the makkin' o'
    humour, we're a' dependent on other fowk to tak' note o' the
    humour. There's no nane o' us 'at's lauched at anything you've
    telt us. But they'll lauch at me. Noo then," he roared out, "'A
    pie sat on a pear-tree.'"</p>

    <p>We all knew this song of TAMMAS'S. A shout of laughter went
    up from the whole gathering. The stranger fell backwards into
    the sty a senseless mass.</p>

    <p>"Man, man," said HOOKEY to TAMMAS, as we walked home; "what
    a crittur ye are! What pit that in your heed?"</p>

    <p>"It juist took a grip o' me," replied TAMMAS, without moving
    a muscle; "it flashed upon me 'at he'd no stand that auld song.
    That's where the humour o' it comes in."</p>

    <p>"Ou, ay," added HENDRY, "Thrums is the place for rale
    humour." On the whole, I agree with him.</p>

    <h3>PARS ABOUT PICTURES.</h3>

    <p>Close upon a hundred years ago, when GEORGE THE THIRD was
    King, MENDOZA opened a saloon in the Strand, whereat various
    studies in Black and Blue might be enjoyed. To-day MENDOZA has
    a gallery in King Street, which is devoted to studies in Black
    and White. You may say, history repeats itself. Nothing of the
    kind. The gentleman of GEORGE THE THIRD'S time devoted himself
    to the pugilistic art; the gentleman of the time of VICTORIA
    gives his attention to graphic art. The one was the patron of
    fists, the other of fingers&mdash;that makes all the
    difference. MENDOZA the Past, closed eyes&mdash;MENDOZA the
    Present opens them, and, if you go to the St. James's Gallery,
    you will find a pleasant collection of Eye Art&mdash;open to
    all peepers. It is true it may not be High Art, but you will
    find it, like Epps's Cocoa, "grateful and comforting."</p>

    <p>Mr. MCLEAN, who has had an Art-show in the Haymarket since
    the days of GEORGE THE THIRD, or rather his ancestor had, is
    "quite up to time, and smiling," with his present collection
    (your Old PAR can't help using the argot of the P.R., and
    brings COLE, not to Newcastle, but to the Haymarket, in "<i>A
    Bend in the River, near Maple Durham</i>." He shows us the
    views of BURTON BARBER on "<i>Compulsory Education</i>," also a
    wondrous picture of the "<i>Gate of the Great Mosque of
    Damascus</i>," by BAUERNFEIND, "<i>A Venetian Brunette</i>," by
    FILDES, and many other works that will well repay inspection,
    but of which there is no space for anything more to be said by
    yours par-enthetically,</p>

    <h3>THE GENTLE ART (OF SNIGGLING).</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="note">["Whoever walks beside the river (the
        Ettrick), will observe five or six or more men and boys,
        equipped with gigantic wading-breeches, busy in each pool.
        They are only armed with rods and flies, and thus have a
        false appearance of being fair fishers.... The truth is

    <p>Discovered on returning home that the Member for SARK had
    not at all exaggerated the facts picturing disaster to our
    onion-bed. This portion of the garden had been disappointing
    from the first. Early in the Spring, when hope beat high, and
    the young gardener's fancy lightly turned to thoughts of large
    crops, SARK and I were resting after a frugal luncheon, when
    ARPACHSHAD suddenly appeared at the open window. I knew from
    his beaming face that something was wrong.</p>

    <p>Perhaps I should explain that ARPACHSHAD is our head
    gardener. We have no other, therefore he is the head. Out of
    the garden he is known as PETER WALLOPS. It was SARK who
    insisted upon calling him ARPACHSHAD. SARK had noticed that
    about the time of the Flood there was singular deliberation in
    entering upon the marriage state. Matrimony did not seem to be
    thought of till a man had turned the corner of a century. SHEM,
    himself, for example, was fully a hundred before his third son,
    ARPACHSHAD, was born. But ARPACHSHAD was already a husband and
    a father at thirty-five.</p>

    <p>"That," said SARK, "is a remarkable circumstance that has
    escaped the notice of the commentators. It indicates unusual
    forwardness of character and a habit of swift decision. We hear
    nothing more of ARPACHSHAD, but we may be sure he made things
    move. Now what we want in this garden is a brisk man, a fellow
    always up to date, if not ahead of it. Let us encourage WALLOPS
    by calling him ARPACHSHAD."</p>

    <p>WALLOPS on being consulted said, he thought it ought to be a
    matter of another two shillings a-week in his wages; to which I
    demurred, and it was finally compromised on the basis of a rise
    of a shilling a-week. As far as I have observed, SARK'S device,
    like many others he has put forward, has nothing in it. WALLOPS
    couldn't be slower in going round than is ARPACHSHAD. The only
    time he ever displays any animation is when he discovers some
    fresh disaster. When things are going well (which isn't often)
    he is gloomy and apprehensive of an early change for the worse.
    When the worst comes he positively beams over it. Difficult to
    say whether he enjoys himself more in an over-wet season, or in
    one of drought. His special and ever-recurring joy is the
    discovery of some insect breaking out in a fresh place. He is
    always on the look-out for the Mottled Amber Moth, or the
    Frit-fly, or the Currant Scale, or the Apple-bark Beetle, or
    the Mustard Beetle,&mdash;"Black Jack," as he familiarly calls
    him. To see, as is not unfrequent, a promising apple-tree,
    cherry-tree, or damson-tree, fading under the attack of the
    caterpillars of the Winter Moth, makes ARPACHSHAD a new man.
    His back unbends, his wrinkles smooth out, the gleam of faded
    youth reillumines his countenance, and his eyes melt in softer
    glance.</p>

    <p>"The flies hev got at them honions," he said, on this Spring
    afternoon. "I thought they would, and I reckon they're done
    for. Ever seen a honion-fly, Sir? A nice, lively, busy-looking
    thing; pretty reddish-grey coat, with a whitish face, and pale
    grey wings. About this time of the year it lays its eggs on the
    sheath of the onion-leaf, and within a week you've got the
    larvey burrowing down into the bulb; after which, there's
    hardly any hope for your honion."</p>

    <p>"Can nothing be done to save them?" SARK asked. As far me, I
    was too down-hearted to speak.</p>

    <p>"Well," said ARPACHSHAD, ruefully, not liking the prospect
    of interfering with beneficent Nature, "if you was to get a bag
    of soot, wait about till a shower was a coming on, carefully
    sprinkle the plant, and let the soot wash in, <i>that</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page232"
       id="page232"></a>[pg 232]</span> might save a few here and
       there. Or if you were to get a can of paraffin, and syringe
       them, it would make the fly sit up. But I don't know as how
       it's worth the trouble. Nater will have its way, and, if the
       fly wants the honion, who are we that we should say it nay?
       I think, TOBY, M.P., if I was you, I'd let things take their
       swing. It's a terrible thing to go a interfering with
       Nater."</p>

    <p>But we didn't follow ARPACHSHAD'S advice. Having undertaken
    to run this garden, we were determined to do it thoroughly; so
    I got SARK to sweep out the flues of the furnace in the
    greenhouse, in the course of which he broke several panes of
    glass, not expecting, so he explained, to find the handle of
    his brush so near the roof. We half filled a sack with soot,
    and carried it to the onion-bed. Then we waited for a wet day,
    usually plentiful enough in haymaking time, now long deferred.
    ARPACHSHAD insisted that we were to make quite sure that rain
    was coming&mdash;then sprinkle the soot over the unsuspectiong
    onion. "We waited just too long, not starting till the rain
    began to fall. Found it exceedingly unpleasant handling the
    soot under conditions of moisture. But, as SARK said, having
    put our hands to the soot-bag, we were not going to turn back.
    Nor did we till we had completed the task, ARPACHSHAD looking
    on, cheered only by the hope that the heavy rain would wash the
    soot off before it could have any effect on the fly. On the
    whole, the task proved productive of reward. Either ARPACHSHAD
    had been mistaken, and the crop had not been attacked by the
    fly, or the soot had done its work. Anyhow, the bed bloomed and
    blossomed, and, at the time I left for Midlothian, was looking
    exceedingly well. Then came SARK'S telegram, as described in
    the last chapter. After the fly came the mildew. Close on the
    heels, or rather the wings, of the <i>Anthomyia Ceparum</i>,
    fell the <i>Peronospora Schleideniana.</i></p>

    <p>"It isn't often it happens," said ARPACHSHAD, rubbing his
    hands gleefully;&mdash;"but, when you get one on the top of
    t'other, you don't look for much crop in that particular
    year."</p>

    <p>Read <i>The World and the Will</i>, by JAMES PAYN, says the
    Baron. Successful novelist is our "J.P." for England and the
    Colonies generally. "The profits blazoned on the Payn," is a
    line he quotes, with a slight difference of spelling, in his
    present three volumes, which is full of good things; his own
    "asides" being, to my thinking, quoth the Baron, by far the
    most enjoyable part of his books. Herein he resembles
    THACKERAY, who used to delight in taking the reader behind the
    scenes, and exhibiting the wires. Not so JAMES PAYN. He comes
    in front, and comments upon the actions of his puppets, or upon
    men and morals in general, or he makes a quip, or utters a
    quirk, or proposes a quiddity, and pauses to laugh with you,
    before he resumes the story, and says, with the older
    romancers, "But to our tale." Most companionable writer is
    JAMES PAYN. Tells his story so clearly. A PAYN to be seen
    through.</p>

    <p>In the christening of his Christmas books, Mr. MERRY ANDREW
    LANG has hit upon a genuine Happy Thought, on which the Baron
    begs sincerely to congratulate him. It is a perfect little gold
    mine as a book-title series. Last year M. ANDREW LANG wrote,
    and LANGMAN'S&mdash;no, beg pardon&mdash;LONGMANS published
    <i>The Blue Fairy Book.</i> The <i>Blue Fairy Book</i>, when it
    appeared, however, was read everywhere, so this year the MERRY
    ANDREW issues <i>The Red Fairy Book</i>, which, of course, will
    be more read than the other. Excellent notion! Where will it
    stop? Why should it stop? Next year there'll be <i>The Green
    Fairy Book</i>; in '92 the <i>Yellow Fairy Book</i> (commencing
    with new version of <i>Yellow Dwarf</i>), then the White, then
    the Black, then the Ver-millionth edition, and so on and so on,
    <i>ad infinitum</i>, through all the possible stages of the
    combination and permutation of colour.</p>

    <p><i>The Magazine of Art for 1890</i>, published by CASSELL
    &amp; Co., is one of the best of its kind for pictures and
    Art-articles, The Mixture as before.</p>

    <p>"Christmas is coming"&mdash;but the Publishers seem to think
    that the Merry Old Gentleman will be here to-morrow. Yet we
    know the proverbial history of to-morrow. However, to humour
    the up-to-date notion, the Baron recommends to his young
    friends who wish to amuse their elders, <i>Dolldom</i>, a
    dolls' opera, by CLIFTON BINGHAM, set to music by FLORIAN
    PASCAL. Some of the songs are exquisite. It would make a very
    funny play, children imitating dolls. Published by J.
    WILLIAMS.</p>

    <p>BLACKIE AND SON, are going it. Here are two more, by their

    in the Conquest of Mexico. Of a more modern date is <i>A
    Chapter of Accidents</i>, which deals with the Bombardment of
    Alexandria. The young fisher-lad has to go through many
    chapters of adventure before he reaches a happy ending. <i>A
    Rough Shaking</i>, by GEORGE MACDONALD, is a capital boys'
    book, while <i>The Light Princess, and other Fairy Stories,</i>
    by the same author, will please the Baron's old-fashioned
    fairy-book readers at Christmas-time.</p>

    <p>Whoever possesses the <i>Henry Irving

    enthusiastic friend the late FRANK MARSHALL, and now concluded
    by the new volume of plays, poems, and sonnets,&mdash;possesses
    a literary treasure. The notes are varied, interesting, and all
    valuable. The illustrations exactly serve their purpose, which
    is the highest praise.</p>

    <p>MR. SMALLEY'S Letters are not to an <i>Inconnue</i>. They
    were written to his paper, the <i>Tribune</i>, and have
    redressed the balance between the Old World and the New by
    furnishing New York from week to week with brilliant, incisive,
    and faithful pictures of life in London. The initials,
    "G.W.S.," appended in their original form, are as familiar
    throughout the United States as are those of our own "G.A.S."
    in the still United Kingdom. Mr. SMALLEY goes everywhere, sees
    everything, knows everybody, and his readers in New York learn
    a great deal more of what is going on in London than some of us
    who live here. Most public men of the present day, whether in
    politics, literature, or art, have, all unconsciously, sat to
    "G.W.S." He has a wonderful gift of seizing the salient points
    of a character, and reproducing them in a few pellucid
    sentences. The men he treats of have many friends who will be
    delighted to find that Mr. SMALLEY'S pen is dipped in just
    enough gall to make the writing pleasant to those who are not
    its topic. <i>Personalities</i> is the alluring title of the
    first volume, which contains forty-two studies of character. It
    is dangerous kind of work; but Mr. SMALLEY has skilfully
    steered his passage. Written for a newspaper, <i>London
    Letters</i> (MACMILLAN &amp; CO.) rank higher than journalism.
    They will take their place in Literature.</p>

    <p>November Number of the <i>English Illustrated Magazine</i>,
    excellent. Wykehamists, please note Mr. GALE'S article, and
    Lord SELBORNE'S introduction. The COOKE who presides in this
    particular kitchen serves up a capital dish every
    month&mdash;and "quite English, you know."</p>

    <p>My faithful "Co." has been rather startled by a volume
    called <i>The Decline and Fall of the British Empire</i>,
    written by "Anonymous," and published by the Messrs. TRISCHLER.
    The tome deals with Australia, rather than England, and is
    dated a thousand years hence; so those who have no immediate
    leisure will have plenty of time to read it before the events
    therein recorded, so to speak, reach maturity.</p>

    <p>I notice an advertisement of a book by Major ELLIS, entitled
    <i>The Ewe-speaking People of the Slave Coast of West
    Africa</i>. These Ewe-speaking folk must be a sheepish lot.
    Black-sheepish lot apparently, as being in West Africa. Major
    ELLIS is the author also of <i>The Tshi-speaking People</i>.
    These last must be either timidly bashful, or else a very T-shi
    lot. After this, there's nothing ELLIS this week, says</p>

    <p>DEAREST BECKY,&mdash;I have had <i>such</i> luck! Oh,
    <i>so</i> fortunate! Fancy, we <i>did</i> get in, after all!
    You know Mr. TENTERFORE, of Somerset House, has a friend a
    barrister, and this friend said, if we would be by the door of
    the Court at eleven, he <i>thought</i> he could slip us in. And
    he did, my dear&mdash;he did! We got <i>capital</i> places, and
    as we had brought with us some sherry and sandwiches, we had "a
    real good time of it," as your brother calls it! We had our
    work, too, and so were <i>quite</i> comfortable. The
    night-charges were <i>such</i> fun! A lot of men and women were
    brought before the Magistrate for being "drunk and incapable"
    (that's a legal term, my dear), and got so chaffed! One of the
    women was very old&mdash;such a silly frump!&mdash;she was
    still dreadfully intoxicated I am afraid! Very sad, <i>of
    course</i>, but we couldn't help laughing! She was <i>such</i>
    a figure before they got rid of her! But this was only the
    overture to the drama. After the night-charges were over, the
    Court was cleared, but we were allowed to remain, as Mr.
    WIGINBLOCK (our barrister friend) declared we belonged to the
    Press! He said that MARY contributed to the <i>Blood and
    Thunder News</i>, and I to the <i>Murder Gazette</i>! I am sure
    it must have been in <i>fun</i>, for we have never <i>seen</i>
    the papers. When lunch was over, in came the Magistrate with
    <i>a number</i> of the "<i>smartest</i>" people! Really, I was
    <i>quite delighted</i> to be in such <i>good</i> company. All
    sorts of <i>nice</i> people. And then&mdash;oh&mdash;it was
    <i>lovely</i>! We saw <i>her quite</i> close, and could watch
    the colour come and go in her cheeks! She is rather pretty! She
    was wearing her <i>ordinary</i> clothes; not the workhouse, nor
    the ones <i>with the blood on them</i>, but some that had been
    sent in to her since the inquest. I tried your opera-glasses.
    They are <i>simply capital</i>, darling! We were much amused
    with <i>his</i> evidence; and it was really <i>excellent</i>
    fun to listen to the howls of the crowd outside! But I am not
    sure <i>he</i> cared for them! We got away in <i>excellent</i>
    time, and I hope to go again. I am trying <i>very hard</i>
    (should it come to anything) to be present at the <i>last scene
    of all!</i> Wouldn't that be <i>lovely</i>? I should have to be
    at the place, though, at <i>ten minutes to eight o'clock!</i> I
    don't think I should go to bed that night <i>at all!</i> If I
    did, I am <i>sure</i> I should not sleep! It would be so very,
    <i>very</i> interesting! And now, my <i>dearest</i>,
    good-bye.</p>

    <h3>QUIS NOMINABIT?</h3>

    <p class="center">(<i>Being a few Remarks &agrave; Apropos of a
    "British Academy of Letters</i>.")</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>MR. PUNCH, SIR,</p>

        <p>I have been reading with some morbid interest a series
        of contributions to the pages of a contemporary from
        several more or less distinguished literary men who have
        apparently been invited to express their opinions,
        favourable or the reverse, on the recently launched
        proposition to establish in our midst, after the French
        model, a "British Academy of Letters." Some ask, "What's
        the use?" Others want to know who is to elect the elected,
        and seem much exercised in their minds as to the status and
        qualifications of those who ought to be chosen for the
        purpose of discharging this all-important function. As to
        what would be the use of an institution of the kind, the
        answer is so obvious that I will not attempt to reply to
        it. But if it comes to naming a representative body capable
        of selecting the two or three thousand aspirants who have
        already, in imagination, seen their claims to the
        distinction recognised by the elective body to which has
        been entrusted the duty of weighing their respective
        merits&mdash;well then, to use a colloquial phrase, I may
        confidently say that "I am all there!"</p>

        <p>Of course. Royalty must head it, so I head the list of,
        say, twelve Academic Electors, with the name of H.R.H. the
        Prince of WALES. This should be followed up by that of some
        generally widely-known personage, who has the literary
        confidence of the public, and in this connection, I have no
        hesitation in supplying it by that of the Compiler of
        <i>Bradshaw's Railway Guide</i>. Several now should follow,
        of varied and even conflicting interests, so as to satisfy
        any over-captious criticism inclined to question the
        thoroughly cosmopolitan character of the elective body. And
        so I next add, Mr. Sheriff AUGUSTUS HARRIS, H.R.H. the Duke
        of CAMBRIDGE, the Proprietor of PEARS' Soap, and the Beadle
        of the Burlington Arcade.</p>

        <p>It might now be well to give a distinctively literary
        flavour to the body, and so I am disposed to continue my
        list with the names of the Poet Laureate and the City
        Editor of <i>Tit Bits</i>, following them up with the
        representatives of commercial enterprise, speculative art,
        and sportive leisure, guaranteed respectively by the names
        of the Chairman of the Chelsea Steam-boat Company, Mr. R.
        D'OYLY CARTE, and Prince HENRY OP BATTENBERG. For the
        twelfth, and remaining name, I would suggest that of Mr.
        HENRY IRVING, the Archbishop of CANTERBURY, the Manager of
        Madame TUSSAUD'S Wax Works, Sir WILFRID LAWSON, General
        BOOTH, Mr. SLAVIN, Mr. J.L. TOOLE, or any other striking or
        notable one that arrests the eye with the familiarity of
        long acquaintance. With the existing deplorable position of
        the Pantomime literature of the country, there can be
        little need to question further the necessity of a British
        Academy of Letters. The naming of those who are to
        constitute that institution is another thing; but if an
        authoritative fountain-head, to discharge this inevitable
        function, is sought, and the public puts the question,
        "<i>Quis Nominabit</i>?" I think, Sir, you will admit that
        I have most satisfactorily supplied the answer. Trusting to
        your judicious appreciation of the full gravity of the
        matter at issue, to publish this communication,</p>

        <p>SIR,&mdash;In the <i>Times</i>' Court Circular, on
        Friday last, I read that&mdash;</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p class="note">"Mr. WILLIAM NICHOLL had the honour of
            singing before Her MAJESTY and the Royal Family."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>This was indeed an honour. I regret that the Courtly
        Circularist did not tell us what Mr. NICHOLL sang before
        the QUEEN and Royal Family, and also what the QUEEN and
        Royal Family sang (solo and chorus?) after Mr. NICHOLL. But
        suppose "before" does not here relate to time, but to
        position. It would have been a novelty indeed, and one well
        worth recording, if Mr. NICHOLL had had the honour of
        sinking <i>behind</i> the Royal Family. And then, what a
        compliment if Her Gracious MAJESTY and the Royal Family had
        all turned round to listen to him! If I am wrong in my
        interpretation of the Court Circular's Circular Note,
        wouldn't it have prevented any possible error to have said,
        "In the presence of"? I only ask for information, and

    are, a man in full evening dress, which he tries to conceal
    under a caped cloak, and two Ladies in plush opera-cloaks. Fog
    is hanging about in the rafters, and the gas-stars sing a
    melancholy dirge. Each casual cough arouses dismal echoes.
    Enter an intending Spectator, who is conducted to a seat in the
    middle of an empty row. After removing his hat and coat, he
    suddenly thinks better&mdash;or worse&mdash;of it, puts them on
    again, and vanishes hurriedly.</i></p>

    <p>They is still so jolly busy at the "Grand" that I had sum
    differculty in getting leaf of habsense for Satterday, larst
    week, for to go with a werry seleck Copperashun Party on a most
    himportent hexcurshun to Burn'em Beaches about cuttin all the
    trees down, so that then it woodn't be not Burn'em Beaches not
    no longer! Howewer, by promisin for to stick to the "Grand" all
    thro' the cumming Winter, the too Gentelmanly Managers let me
    go.</p>

    <p>The fust thing as summat staggered me, in a long day of
    staggerers, was the fack, that all the hole Party had a grand
    Royal Saloon all to theirselves for to take them to Slough, but
    my estonishment ceased when I saw that they was Chairmaned by
    the same "King of good fellers" as took 'em all to Ship Lake on
    a prewious ocasion. They didn't have not no refreshments all
    the way to Slough, so they was naterally all pretty well harf
    starved by the time they got there, but there they found a
    lovly Shampane Lunshon a waiting for to refresh xhawsted Natur,
    and at it they went like One o'Clock altho it wasn't only arf
    parst Elewen. Now for the second staggerer! One of the party, a
    rayther antient Deputty, insted of jining the rest of the
    Party, declared his intenshun to take his Lunch off the
    Sunshine which was shining most brillient outside the room, and
    acordingly off he set a warking up and down in it for three
    quorters of a hour, without not no wittels nor no drink! till
    "the King of all good fellers" coodn't stand it not no longer,
    and sent me out to him with sum sangwidges and a bottel of
    Sham. He woodn't not touch no sangwidges, and ony took one
    glass of wine, and told me to put by the bottel for his dinner,
    which I did in course; but somehows, when he arsked for it
    arterwards, the cork had got out, and the wine had got out, but
    I thinks I can wenture to say as that not one drop of it was
    wasted, and werry good it was too.</p>

    <p>We then set out on our luvly drive, me on the box-seat of
    one of the Carridges, and the other pore fellers cramped up
    hinside. Sumhows or other, weather it was hoeing to the nobel
    Lunch or not, I don't kno, we lost our way, and found ourselves
    at larst, not where we all wanted to be, but at a most
    bewtifool House of call, where they has the werry sensebel
    custom that, when they thinks as wisiters has had enuff drink,
    they won't let 'em have not a Drop More, and that is acshally
    the name by which the ouse is known, both far and wide! Whether
    it's a good plan for the howse, in course I don't kno, but Mr.
    FOURBES, the souperintendent of the Beeches, says as nothink
    woodn't injuice 'em to alter the name. Whether that singler
    custom had anythink to do with it I don't kno, but our party
    didn't stay there long, and we soon found ourselves at
    bewtifool Burn'em Beaches.</p>

    <p>In course I didn't intrewde myself when they was a settling
    of the himportant bizziness as they was cum about, so I
    strolled off to a little willage as I seed in the distance, and
    which is acshally called Egipt, tho it ain't much bigger than
    Whetstone Park, Hobern, the ome of my herly birth! From a
    rayther hurryed conwersashun with a real Native, I gathered the
    himportant fack that the one reason why all the great big Beach
    Trees of the Forest had had their tops cut off, was, that
    OLIWER CROMWEEL wanted the bows for his sojers to carry, so as
    to make 'em look more than they was when he marched at their
    Hed to the Seege of Winsor Carsel! What curius and hinteresting
    hinformashun we can get from the werry humblest of our Feller
    Creturs when we goes the rite way to git it!</p>

    <p>I got back to the Party jest as they had cum to the werry
    senserbil reserlushun that Nowember was not at all the best
    munth to see whether Trees was really dead, or was ony
    shamming, so they determined, like true patriots as they is, to
    adjourn the matter till the 1st of next April, by which time
    they woud be able to decide.</p>

    <p>On our way back to Slough they all got out to see Stoke
    Pogies Church, where some great Poet was buried long long ago,
    who had wrote a most lovely Poem there, all about what could be
    seen from the Churchyard of an evening, and one of the party
    said, that the sperrit of the bewtifool seen and of the luvly
    Poem was so strong upon him, that, if they woud stand round the
    Toom, he woud try to recite some of its sweetest lines, and he
    did so, and I heard one on 'em say, as we was a driving back,
    that more than one among them had his eyes filled with plessant
    tears as he lissened. Ah, it isn't for a pore Waiter like me to
    write on these matters, but I hopes as I don't offend not
    anybody when I says, that praps if jest a leetle more pains was
    taken for to make us pore fellers understand, and feel, and
    share in the rapshur as such poems seems to inspire in our
    betters, it might help to smooth, if not to shorten, the long
    dreary road as lies between the Hignorant and the
    Heddicated.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
