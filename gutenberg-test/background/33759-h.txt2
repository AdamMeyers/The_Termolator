The Key to Yesterday



CHAPTER I


The palings of the grandstand inclosure
creaked in protest under the pressure. The shadows
of forward-surging men wavered far out
across the track. A smother of ondriving dust
broke, hurricane-like, around the last turn,
sweeping before it into the straightaway a struggling
mass of horse-flesh and a confusion of
stable-colors. Back to the right, the grandstand
came to its feet, bellowing in a madman       s
chorus.

Out of the forefront of the struggle strained
a blood-bay colt. The boy, crouched over the
shoulders, was riding with hand and heel to
the last ounce of his strength and the last subtle
feather-weight of his craft and skill. At
his saddleskirts pressed a pair of distended
nostrils and a black, foam-flecked muzzle. Behind,
with a gap of track and daylight between,
trailed the laboring        ruck.       

[Pg 2]
A tall stranger, who had lost his companion
and host in the maelstrom of the betting shed,
had taken his stand near the angle where the
paddock grating meets the track fence. A
Derby crowd at Churchill Downs is a congestion
of humanity, and in the obvious impossibility
of finding his friend he could here at
least give his friend the opportunity of finding
him, since at this point were a few panels of
fence almost clear. As the two colts fought
out the final decisive furlongs, the black nose
stealing inch by inch along the bay neck, the
stranger       s face wore an interest not altogether
that of the casual race-goer. His shoulders
were thrown back, and his rather lean jaw angle
swept into an uncompromising firmness of chin       just
now uptilted.

The man stood something like six feet of
clear-cut physical fitness. There was a declaration
in his breadth of shoulder and depth of
chest, in his slenderness of waist and thigh, of
a life spent only partly within walls, while the
free swing of torso might have intimated to
the expert observer that some of it had been
spent in the saddle.

[Pg 3]
Of the face itself, the eyes were the commanding
features. They were gray eyes, set
under level brows; keenly observant by token
of their clear light, yet tinged by a half-wistful
softness that dwells hauntingly in the eyes of
dreamers.

Just now, the eyes saw not only the determination
of a four-furlong dash for two-year-olds,
but also, across the fresh turf of the infield,
the radiant magic of May, under skies
washed brilliant by April       s rains.

Then, as the colts came abreast and passed
in a muffled roar of drumming hoofs, his eyes
suddenly abandoned the race at the exact moment
of its climax: as hundreds of heads
craned toward the judges        stand, his own gaze
became a stare focused on a point near his
elbow.

He stared because he had seen, as it seemed
to him, a miracle, and the miracle was a girl.
It was, at all events, nothing short of miraculous
that such a girl should be discovered standing,
apparently unaccompanied, down in this
bricked area, a few yards from the paddock
and the stools of the bookmakers.

[Pg 4]
Unlike his own, her eyes had remained constant
to the outcome of the race, and now her
face was averted, so that only the curve of one
cheek, a small ear and a curling tendril of brown
hair under the wide, soft brim of her Panama
hat rewarded him for the surrender of the spectacle
on the track.

Most ears, he found himself reflecting with,
a sense of triumphant discovery, simply grow
on the sides of heads, but this one might have
been fashioned and set by a hand gifted with
the exquisite perfection of the jeweler       s art.

A few moments before, the spot where she
stood had been empty save for a few touts and
trainers. It seemed inconceivable, in the abrupt
revelation of her presence, that she could, like
himself, have been simply cut off from companions
and left for the interval waiting. He
caught himself casting about for a less prosaic
explanation. Magic would seem to suit her
better than mere actuality. She was sinuously
slender, and there was a splendid hint of gallantry
in the unconscious sweep of her shoulders.
He was conscious that the simplicity of
her pongee gown loaned itself to an almost
[Pg 5]
barbaric freedom of carriage with the same
readiness as do the draperies of the Winged
Victory. Yet, even the Winged Victory achieves
her grace by a pose of triumphant action, while
this woman stood in repose except for the delicate
forward-bending excitement of watching
the battle in the stretch.

The man was not, by nature, susceptible.
Women as sex magnates had little part in his
life cosmos. The interest he felt now with
electrical force, was the challenge that beauty
in any form made upon his enthusiasm. Perhaps,
that was why he stood all unrealizing the
discourtesy of his gaping scrutiny       a scrutiny
that, even with her eyes turned away, she must
have felt.

At all events, he must see her face. As the
crescendo of the grandstand       s suspense graduated
into the more positive note of climax
and began to die, she turned toward him. Her
lips were half-parted, and the sun struck her
cheeks and mouth and chin into a delicate brilliance
of color, while the hat-brim threw a
band of shadow on forehead and eyes. The
man       s impression was swift and definite. He
[Pg 6]
had been waiting to see, and was prepared.
The face, he decided, was not beautiful by the
gauge of set standards. It was, however,
beautiful in the better sense of its individuality;
in the delicacy of the small, yet resolute, chin
and the expressive depth of the eyes. Just
now, they were shaded into dark pools of blue,
but he knew they could brighten into limpid
violet.

She straightened up as she turned and met
his stare with a steadiness that should have
disconcerted it, yet he found himself still studying
her with the detached, though utterly engrossed,
interest of the critic. She did not start
or turn hurriedly away. Somehow, he caught
the realization that flight had no part in her
system of things.

The human tide began flowing back toward
the betting shed, and left them alone in a
cleared space by the palings. Then, the man
saw a quick anger sweep into the girl       s face
and deepen the color of her cheeks. Her chin
went up a trifle, and her lips tightened.

He found himself all at once in deep confusion.
He wanted to tell her that he had not
[Pg 7]
realized the actuality of his staring impertinence,
until she had, with a flush of unuttered
wrath and embarrassment, revealed the depth
of his felony ... for he could no longer regard
it as a misdemeanor.

There was a note of contempt in her eyes
that stung him, and presently he found himself
stammering an excuse.

       I beg your pardon       I didn       t realize it,       
he began lamely. Then he added as though to
explain it all with the frank outspokenness of a
school-boy:        I was wishing that I could paint
you       I couldn       t help gazing.       

For a few moments as she stood rigidly and
indignantly silent, he had opportunity to reflect
on the inadequacy of his explanation. At
last, she spoke with the fine disdain of affronted
royalty.

       Are you quite through looking at me?
May I go now?       

He was contrite.

       I don       t know that I could explain       but
it wasn       t meant to be       to be                      He broke
off, floundering.

       It       s a little strange,        she commented
[Pg 8]
quietly as though talking to herself,        because
you look like a gentleman.       

The man flushed.

       You are very kind and flattering,        he said,
his face instantly hardening.        I sha       n       t tax you
with explanation. I don       t suppose any woman
could be induced to understand that a man may
look at her       even stare at her       without disrespect,
just as he might look at a sunset or a
wonderful picture.        Then, he added half in
apology, half in defiance:        I don       t know much
about women anyway.       

For a moment, the girl stood with her face
resolutely set, then she looked up again, meeting
his eyes gravely, though he thought that
she had stifled a mutinous impulse of her
pupils to riffle into amusement.

       I must wait here for my uncle,        she told
him.        Unless you have to stay, perhaps you
had better go.       

The tall stranger swung off toward the betting
shed without a backward glance, and engulfed
himself in the mob where one had to
fight and shoulder a difficult way in zigzag
course.

[Pg 9]
Back of the forming lines of winners with
tickets to cash, he caught sight of a young man
almost as tall as himself and characterized by
the wholesome attractiveness of one who has
taken life with zest and decency. He wore
also upon feature and bearing the stamp of an
aristocracy that is not decadent. To the side
of this man, the stranger shouldered his way.

       Since you abandoned me,        he accused,
       I       ve been standing out there like a little boy
who has lost his nurse.        After a pause, he
added:        And I       ve seen a wonderful girl       the
one woman in your town I want to meet.       

His host took him by the elbow, and began
steering him toward the paddock gate.

       So, you have discovered a divinity, and are
ready to be presented. And you are the scoffer
who argues that women may be eliminated.
You are       or were       the man who didn       t care
to know them.       

The guest answered calmly and with brevity:

       I       m not talking about women. I       m talking
about a woman       and she       s totally different.       

       Who is she, Bob?       

[Pg 10]
       How should I know?       

       I know a few of them       suppose you describe
her.       

The stranger halted and looked at his friend
and host with commiserating pity. When he
deigned to speak, it was with infinite scorn.

       Describe her! Why, you fool, I       m no poet
laureate, and, if I were, I couldn       t describe
her!       

For reply, he received only the disconcerting
mockery of ironical laughter.

       My interest,        the young man of the fence
calmly deigned to explain,        is impersonal. I
want to meet her, precisely as I       d get up early
in the morning and climb a mountain to see the
sun rise over a particularly lovely valley. It       s
not as a woman, but as an object of art.       


On other and meaner days, the track at
Churchill Downs may be in large part surrendered
to its more rightful patrons, the
chronics and apostles of the turf, and racing
may be only racing as roulette is roulette. But
on Derby Day it is as though the community
paid tribute to the savor of the soil, and
[Pg 11]
honored in memory the traditions of the ancient
r        gime.

To-day, in the club-house inclosure, the
roomy verandahs, the close-cropped lawn and
even the roof-gallery were crowded; not indeed
to the congestion of the grandstand       s perspiring
swarm, for Fashion       s reservation still
allowed some luxury of space, but beyond the
numbers of less important times. In the burgeoning
variety of new spring gowns and hats,
the women made bouquets, as though living
flowers had been brought to the shrine of the
thoroughbred.

A table at the far end of the verandah
seemed to be a little Mecca for strolling visitors.
In the party surrounding it, one might
almost have caught the impression that the
prettiness of the feminine display had been
here arranged, and that in scattering attractive
types along the front of the white club-house,
some landscape gardener had reserved the
most appealing beauties for a sort of climacteric
effect at the end.

Sarah and Anne Preston were there, and
wherever the Preston sisters appeared there
[Pg 12]
also were usually gathered together men, not
to the number of two and three, but in full
quorum. And, besides the Preston sisters, this
group included Miss Buford and a fourth girl.

Indeed, it seemed to be this fourth who held,
with entire unconsciousness, more than an equal
share of attention. Duska Filson was no more
cut to the pattern of the ordinary than the Russian
name her romantic young mother had
given her was an exponent of the life about
her. She was different, and at every point of
her divergence from a routine type it was the
type that suffered by the contrast. Having
preferred being a boy until she reached that
age when it became necessary to bow to the
dictate of Fate and accept her sex, she had retained
an understanding for, and a comradeship
with, men that made them hers in bondage.
This quality she had combined with all that
was subtly and deliciously feminine, and,
though she loved men as she loved small boys,
some of them had discovered that it was always
as men, never as a man.

She had a delightfully refractory way of
making her own laws to govern her own world       a
[Pg 13]
system for which she offered no apology;
and this found its vindication in the fact
that her world was well-governed       though
with absolutism.

The band was blaring something popular
and reminiscent of the winter       s gayeties, but the
brasses gave their notes to the May air, and
the May air smoothed and melted them into
softness. Duska       s eyes were fixed on the
green turf of the infield where several sentinel
trees pointed into the blue.

Mr. Walter Bellton, having accomplished
the marvelous feat of escaping from the bookmaker       s
maelstrom with the immaculateness of
his personal appearance intact, sauntered up to
drop somewhat languidly into a chair.

       When one returns in triumph,        he commented,
       one should have chaplets of bay and
arches to walk under. It looks to me as
though the reception-committee has not been
on the job.       

Sarah Preston raised a face shrouded in
gravity. Her voice was velvety, but Bellton
caught its undernote of ridicule.

       I render unto Caesar those things that
[Pg 14]
are Caesar       s       but what is your latest triumph?       
She put her question innocently.
       Did you win a bet?       

If Mr. Bellton       s quick-flashing smile was an
acknowledgment of the thrust at his somewhat
notorious self-appraisement, his manner
at least remained imperturbably complacent.

       I was not clamoring for my own just
dues,        he explained, with modesty.        For myself,
I shall be satisfied with an unostentatious
tablet in bronze when I       m no longer with you
in the flesh. In this instance I was speaking for
another.       

He did not hasten to announce the name of
the other. In even the little things of life, this
gentleman calculated to a nicety dramatic values
and effects. Just as a public speaker in
nominating a candidate works up to a climax
of eulogy, and pauses to let his hearers shout,
       Name him! Name your man!        so Mr. Bellton
paused, waiting for someone to ask of
whom he spoke.

It was little Miss Buford who did so with
the d        butante       s legitimate interest in the possibility
of fresh conquest.

[Pg 15]
       And who has returned in triumph?       

       George Steele.       

Sarah Preston arched her brows in mild interest.

       So, the wanderer is home! I had the idea
he was painting masterpieces in the Quartier
Latin, or wandering about with a sketching
easel in southern Spain.       

       Nevertheless, he is back,        affirmed the
man,        and he has brought with him an even
greater celebrity than himself       a painter of international
reputation, it would seem. I met
them a few moments ago in the paddock, and
Steele intimated that they would shortly arrive
to lay their joint laurels at your feet.       

Louisville society was fond of George Steele,
and, when on occasion he dropped back from
       the happy roads that lead around the world,       
it was to find a welcome in his home city only
heightened by his long absence.

       Who is this greater celebrity?        demanded
Miss Buford. She knew that Steele belonged
to Duska Filson, or at least that whenever he
returned it was to renew the proffer of himself,
even though with the knowledge that the
[Pg 16]
answer would be as it had always been: negative.
Her interest was accordingly ready to
consider in alternative the other man.

       Robert A. Saxon       the first disciple of
Frederick Marston,        declared Mr. Bellton.
If no one present had ever heard the name
before, the consequential manner of its announcement
would have brought a sense of deplorable
unenlightenment.

Bellton       s eyes, despite the impression of
weakness conveyed by the heavy lenses of his
nose-glasses, missed little, and he saw that
Duska Filson still looked off abstractedly
across the bend of the homestretch, taking no
note of his heralding.

       Doesn       t the news of new arrivals excite
you, Miss Filson?        he inquired, with a touch
of drawl in his voice.

The girl half-turned her head with a smile
distinctly short of enthusiasm. She did not
care for Bellton. She was herself an exponent
of all things natural and unaffected, and she
read between the impeccably regular lines of
his personality, with a criticism that was adverse.

[Pg 17]
       You see,        she answered simply,        it       s not
news. I       ve seen George since he came.       

       Tell us all about this celebrity,        prompted
Miss Buford, eagerly.        What is he like?       

Duska shook her head.

       I haven       t seen him. He was to arrive this
morning.       

       So, you see,        supplemented Mr. Bellton
with a smile,        you will, after all, have to fall
back on me       I have seen him.       

       You,        demurred the d        butante with a
disappointed frown,        are only a man. What
does a man know about another man?       

       The celebrity,        went on Mr. Bellton,
ignoring the charge of inefficiency,        avoids
women.        He paused to laugh.        He was telling
Steele that he had come to paint landscape,
and I am afraid he will have to be brought
lagging into your presence.       

       It seems rather brutal to drag him here,       
suggested Anne Preston.        I, for one, am
willing to spare him the ordeal.       

       However,        pursued Mr. Bellton with
some zest of recital,        I have warned him. I
told him what dangerous batteries of eyes he
[Pg 18]
must encounter. It seemed to me unfair to let
him charge into the lists of loveliness all unarmed       with
his heart behind no shield.       

       And he ... how did he take your
warning?        demanded Miss Buford.

       I think it is his craven idea to avoid the
danger and retreat at the first opportunity.
He said that he was a painter, had even been a
cow-puncher once, but that society was beyond
his powers and his taste.       

The group had been neglecting the track.
Now, from the grandstand came once more the
noisy outburst that ushers the horses into the
stretch, and conversation died as the party came
to its feet.

None of its members noticed for the moment
the two young men who had made their way
between the chairs of the verandah until they
stood just back of the group, awaiting their
turn for recognition.

As the horses crossed the wire and the pandemonium
of the stand fell away, George
Steele stepped forward to present his guest.

       This is Mr. Robert Saxon,        he announced.
       He will paint the portraits of you girls almost
[Pg 19]
as beautiful as you really are.... It       s as
far as mere art can go.       

Saxon stood a trifle abashed at the form of
presentation as the group turned to greet him.
Something in the distance had caught Duska
Filson       s imagination-brimming eyes. She was
sitting with her back turned, and did not hear
Steele       s approach nor turn with the others.

Saxon       s casually critical glance passed rapidly
over the almost too flawless beauty of the
Preston sisters and the flower-like charm of
little Miss Buford, then fell on a slender girl
in a simple pongee gown and a soft, wide-brimmed
Panama hat. Under the hat-brim,
he caught the glimpse of an ear that might
have been fashioned by a jeweler and a curling
tendril of brown hair. If Saxon had indeed
been the timorous man Bellton intimated,
the glimpse would have thrown him into panic.
As it was, he showed no sign of alarm.

His presentation as a celebrity had focused
attention upon him in a manner momentarily
embarrassing. He found a subtle pleasure in
the thought that it had not called this girl       s
eyes from whatever occupied them out beyond
[Pg 20]
the palings. Saxon disliked the ordinary.
His canvases and his enthusiasms were alike
those of the individualist.

       Duska,        laughed Miss Buford,        come
back from your dreams, and be introduced to
Mr. Saxon.       

The painter acknowledged a moment of suspense.
What would be her attitude when she
recognized the man who had stared at her
down by the paddock fence?

The girl turned. Except himself, no one
saw the momentary flash of amused surprise in
her eyes, the quick change from grave blue to
flashing violet and back again to grave blue.
To the man, the swiftly shifting light of it
seemed to say:        You are at my mercy; whatever
liberality you receive is at the gift and
pleasure of my generosity.       

       I beg your pardon,        she said simply, extending
her hand.        I was just thinking               she
paused to laugh frankly, and it was the music
of the laugh that most impressed Saxon              I
hardly know what I was thinking.       

He dropped with a sense of privileged good-fortune
into the vacant chair at her side.

[Pg 21]
With just a hint of mischief riffling her
eyes, but utter artlessness in her voice, she
regarded him questioningly.

       I wonder if we have not met somewhere
before? It seems to me                     

       Often,        he asserted.        I think it was in
Babylon first, perhaps. And you were a girl
in Macedon when I was a spearman in the
army of Alexander.       

She sat as reflective and grave as though
she were searching her recollections of Babylon
and Macedon for a chance acquaintance,
but under the gravity was a repressed sparkle
of mischievous delight.

After a moment, he demanded brazenly:

       Would you mind telling me which colt
won that first race?       





[Pg 22]

CHAPTER II


       His career has been pretty much a march
of successive triumphs through the world of
art, and he has left the critics only one peg on
which to hang their carping.       

Steele spoke with the warmth of enthusiasm.
He had succeeded in capturing Duska
for a few minutes of monopoly in the semi-solitude
of the verandah at the back of the
club-house. Though he had a hopeless cause
of his own to plead, it was characteristic of
him that his first opportunity should go to the
praise of his friend.

       What is that?        The girl found herself
unaccountably interested and ready to assume
this stranger       s defense even before she knew
with what his critics charged him.

       That he is a copyist,        explained the man;
       that he is so enamored of the style of Frederick
Marston that his pictures can       t shake off
the influence. He is great enough to blaze
his own trail       to create his own school, rather
[Pg 23]
than to follow in the tracks of another. Of
course,        he hastened to defend,        that is hardly
a valid indictment. Every master is, at the beginning
of his career, strongly affected by the
genius of some greater master. The only
mistake lies in following in the footsteps of
one not yet dead. To play follow-the-leader
with a man of a past century is permissible
and laudable, but to give the same allegiance
to a contemporary is, in the narrow view of
the critics, to accept a secondary place.       

The Kentuckian sketched with ardor the
dashing brilliance of the other       s achievement:
how five years had brought him from lethal
obscurity to international fame; how, though a
strictly American product who had not studied
abroad, his Salon pictures had electrified Paris.
And the girl listened with attentive interest.

When the last race was ended and the thousands
were crowding out through the gates,
Saxon heard his host accepting a dinner invitation
for the evening.

       I shall have a friend stopping in town on
his way East, whom I want you all to meet,       
explained Mr. Bellton, the prospective host.
[Pg 24]
       He is one Se        or Ribero, an attach         of a South
American legation, and he may prove interesting.       

Saxon caught himself almost frowning. He
did not care for society       s offerings, but the engagement
was made, and he had now no alternative
to adding his declaration of pleasure
to that of his host. He was, however, silent to
taciturnity as Steele       s runabout chugged its way
along in the parade of motors and carriages
through the gates of the race-track inclosure.
In his pupils, the note of melancholy unrest
was decided, where ordinarily there was only
the hint.

       There is time,        suggested the host,        for
a run out the Boulevard; I       d like to show you
a view or two.       

The suggestion of looking at a promising
landscape ordinarily challenged Saxon       s interest
to the degree of enthusiasm. Now, he only
nodded.

It was not until Steele, who drove his own
car, stopped at the top of the Iroquois Park
hill that Saxon spoke. They had halted at the
southerly brow of the ridge from which the
[Pg 25]
eye sweeps a radius of twenty miles over
purpled hills and polychromatic valleys, to yet
other hills melting into a sky of melting turquois.
Looking across the colorful reaches,
Saxon gave voice to his enthusiasm.

They left the car, and stood on the rocks that
jut out of the clay at the road       s edge. Beneath
them, the wooded hillside fell away, three
hundred feet of precipitous slope and tangle.
For a time, Saxon       s eyes were busy with the avid
drinking in of so much beauty, then once more
they darkened as he wheeled toward his
companion.

       George,        he said slowly,        you told me
that we were to go to a cabin of yours tucked
away somewhere in the hills, and paint landscape.
I caught the idea that we were to lead
a sort of camp-life       that we were to be hermits
except for the companionship of our palettes
and nature and each other       and the few neighbors
that one finds in the country, and                     
The speaker broke off awkwardly.

Steele laughed.

              It is so nominated in the bond.        The
cabin is over there       some twenty miles.        He
[Pg 26]
pointed off across the farthest dim ridge to the
south.        It is among hills where       but to-morrow
you shall see for yourself!       

       To-morrow?        There was a touch of anxious
haste in the inquiry.

       Are you so impatient?        smiled Steele.

Saxon wheeled on his host, and on his forehead
were beads of perspiration though the
breeze across the hilltops was fresh with the
coming of evening. His answer broke from
his lips with the abruptness of an exclamation.

       My God, man, I       m in panic!       

The Kentuckian looked up in surprise, and
his bantering smile vanished. Evidently, he
was talking with a man who was suffering some
stress of emotion, and that man was his friend.

For a moment, Saxon stood rigidly, looking
away with drawn brow, then he began with a
short laugh in which there was no vestige of
mirth:

       When two men meet and find themselves
congenial companions,        he said slowly,        there
need be no questions asked. We met in a
Mexican hut.       

Steele nodded.

[Pg 27]
       Then,        went on Saxon,        we discovered a
common love of painting. That was enough,
wasn       t it?       

Steele again bowed his assent.

       Very well.        The greater painter spoke with
the painfully slow control of one who has taken
himself in hand, selecting tone and words to
safeguard against any betrayal into sudden outburst.
       As long as it       s merely you and I,
George, we know enough of each other. When
it becomes a matter of meeting your friends,
your own people, you force me to tell you something
more.       

       Why?        Steele demanded; almost hotly.        I
don       t ask my friends for references or bonds!       

Saxon smiled, but persistently repeated:

       You met me in Mexico, seven months ago.
What, in God       s name, do you know about me?       

The other looked up, surprised.

       Why, I know,        he said,        I know                     
Then, suddenly wondering what he did know,
he stopped, and added lamely:        I know that
you are a landscape-painter of national reputation
and a damned good fellow.       

       And, aside from that, nothing,        came the
[Pg 28]
quick response.        What I am on the side,
preacher, porch-climber, bank-robber       whatever
else, you don       t know.        The speaker       s
voice was hard.

       What do you mean?       

       I mean that, before you present me to your
friends, to such people for example       well such
people as I met to-day       you have the right to
ask; and the unfortunate part of it is that, when
you ask, I can       t answer.       

       You mean                      the Kentuckian halted in
perplexed silence.

       I mean,        said Saxon, forcing his words,
       that God Almighty only knows who I am, or
where I came from. I don       t.       

Of all the men Steele had ever known, Saxon
had struck him, through months of intimacy,
as the most normal, sane and cleanly constituted.
Eccentricity was alien to him. In the
same measure that all his physical bents were
straight and clean-cut, so he had been mentally
a contradiction of the morbid and irrational.
The Kentuckian waited in open-eyed astonishment,
gazing at the man whose own words had
just convicted him of the wildest insanity.

[Pg 29]
Saxon went on, and even now, in the face
of self-conviction of lunacy, his words fell coldly
logical:

       I have talked to you of my work and my
travels during the past five or six years. I
have told you that I was a cow-puncher on a
Western range; that I drifted East, and took
up art. Did I ever tell you one word of my life
prior to that? Do you know of a single episode
or instance preceding these few fragmentary
chapters? Do you know who, or what I
was seven years ago?       

Steele was dazed. His eyes were studiously
fixed on the gnarled roots and twisted hole
of a scrub oak that hung out over the edge of
things with stubborn and distorted tenacity.

       No,        he heard the other say,        you don       t,
and I don       t.       

Again, there was a pause. The sun was setting
at their backs, but off to the east the hills
were bright in the reflection that the western
sky threw across the circle of the horizon. Already,
somewhere below them, a prematurely
tuneful whippoorwill was sending out its night
call.

[Pg 30]
Steele looked up, and saw the throat of the
other work convulsively, though the lips grimly
held the set, contradictory smile.

       The very name I wear is the name, not of
my family, but of my race. R.      A. Saxon,
Robert Anglo Saxon or Robert Anonymous
Saxon       take your choice. I took that because
I felt that I was not stealing it.       

       Go on,        prompted Steele.

       You have heard of those strange practical
jokes which Nature sometimes       not often, only
when she is preternaturally cruel       plays on
men. They have pathological names for it, I
believe       loss of memory?       

Steele only nodded.

       I told you that I rode the range on the
Anchor-cross outfit. I did not tell you why.
It was because the Anchor-cross took me in
when I was a man without identity. I don       t
know why I was in the Rocky Mountains. I
don       t know what occurred there, but I do know
that I was picked up in a pass with a fractured
skull. I had been stripped almost naked.
Nothing was left as a clew to identity, except
this                     

[Pg 31]
Saxon handed the other a rusty key, evidently
fitting an old-fashioned lock.

       I always carry that with me. I don       t know
where it will fit a door, or what lies behind that
door. I only know that it is in a fashion the
key that can open my past; that the lock which
it fits bars me off from all my life except a fragment.       

Steele mechanically returned the thing, and
Saxon mechanically slipped it back into his
pocket.

       I know, too, that a scar I wear on my right
hand was not fresh when those many others
were. That, also, belongs to the veiled years.

       Some cell of memory was pressed upon by a
splinter of bone, some microscopic atom of brain-tissue
was disturbed       and life was erased. I was
an interesting medical subject, and was taken
to specialists who tried methods of suggestion.
Men talked to me of various things: sought
in a hundred ways to stimulate memory, but
the reminder never came. Sometimes, it would
seem that I was standing on the verge of great
recollections       recollections just back of consciousness       as
a forgotten name will sometimes
[Pg 32]
tease the brain by almost presenting itself yet
remaining elusive.       

Steele was leaning forward, listening while
the narrator talked on with nervous haste.

       I have never told this before,        Saxon said.
       Slowly, the things I had known seemed to
come back. For example, I did not have to relearn
to read and write. All the purely impersonal
things gradually retrieved themselves, but,
wherever a fact might have a tentacle which
could grasp the personal       the ego       that fact
eluded me.       

       How did you drift into art?        demanded
Steele.

       That is it: I drifted into it. I had to
drift. I had no compass, no port of departure
or destination. I was a derelict without a flag
or name.       

       At the Cincinnati Academy, where I first
studied, one of the instructors gave me a hint.
He felt that I was struggling for something
which did not lie the way of his teaching. By
that time, I had acquired some little efficiency
and local reputation. He told me that Marston
was the master for me to study, and he
[Pg 33]
advised me to go further East where I could see
and understand his work. I came, and saw,
       The Sunset in Winter.        You know the rest.       

       But, now,        Steele found himself speaking
with a sense of relief,        now, you are Robert
A. Saxon. You have made yourself from unknown
material, but you have made yourself
a great painter. Why not be satisfied to abandon
this unknown past as the past has abandoned
you?       

       Wait,        the other objected, with the cold
emphasis of a man who will not evade, or seek
refuge in specious alternatives.

       Forget to-night who I am, and to-morrow
I shall have no assurance that the police are
not searching for me. Why, man, I may have
been a criminal. I have no way of knowing. I
am hand-tied. Possibly, I have a wife and family
waiting for me somewhere       needing me!       

His breath came in agitated gasps.

       I am two men, and one of them does not
know the other. Sometimes, it threatens me
with madness       sometimes, for a happy interval,
I almost forget it. At first, it was insupportable,
but the vastness of the prairie and the
[Pg 34]
calm of the mountain seemed to soothe me into
sanity, and give me a grip on myself. The starlight
in my face during nights spent in the saddle       that
was soothing; it was medicine for my
sick brain. These things at least made me
physically perfect. But, since yesterday is
sealed, I must remain to some extent the recluse.
The sort of intercourse we call society
I have barred. That is why I am anxious for
your cabin, rather than your clubs and your
entertainments.       

       You didn       t have to tell me,        said Steele
slowly,        but I       m glad you did. I and my
friends are willing to gauge your past by your
present. But I       m glad of your confidence.       

Saxon raised his face, and his eyes wore an
expression of gratification.

       Yes, I       m glad I told you. If I should go
out before I solve it, and you should ever
chance on the answer, I       d like my own name
over me       and both dates, birth as well as
death. My work is, of course, to learn it all       if
I can; and I hope               he forced a laugh              when
I meet the other man, he will be fit to
shake hands with.       

[Pg 35]
       Listen,        Steele spoke eagerly.        How long
has it been?       

       Over six years.       

       Then, why not go on and round out the
seven? Seven years of absolute disappearance
gives a man legal death. Let the old problem
lie, and go forward as Robert Saxon. That is
the simplest way.       

The other shook his head.

       That would be an evasion. It would prove
nothing. If I discover responsibilities surviving
from the past, I must take them up.       

       What did the physicians say?       

       They didn       t know.        Saxon shook his head.
       Perhaps, some strong reminder may at some
unwarned moment open the volume where it
was closed; perhaps, it will never open. To-morrow
morning, I may awaken Robert Saxon       or
the other man.        He paused, then added
quietly:        Such an unplaced personality had best
touch other lives as lightly as it can.       

Steele went silently over, and cranked the machine.
As he straightened up, he asked abruptly:

       Would you prefer calling off this dinner?       

[Pg 36]
       No.        The artist laughed.        We will take
a chance on my remaining myself until after
dinner, but as soon as convenient                     

       To-morrow,        promised Steele,        we go to
the cabin.       





[Pg 37]

CHAPTER III


Perhaps, the same futile vanity that led
Mr. Bellton to import the latest sartorial novelties
from the Rue de la Paix for the adornment
of his person made him fond of providing foreign
notables to give color to his entertainments.

Mr. Bellton was at heart the poseur, but he
was also the fighter. Even when he carried
the war of political reform into sections of the
town where the lawless elements had marked
him for violence, he went stubbornly in the
conspicuousness of ultra-tailoring. Though he
loved to address the proletariat in the name of
brotherhood, he loved with a deeper passion the
exclusiveness of presiding as host at a board
where his guests included the        best people.       

Se        or Ribero, who at home used the more
ear-filling entitlement of Se        or Don Ricardo de
Ribero y Pierola, was hardly a notable, yet he
was a new type, and, even before the ladies had
emerged from their cloak-room and while the
[Pg 38]
men were apart in the grill, the host felt that
he had secured a successful ingredient for his
mixture of personal elements.

After the fashion of Latin-American diplomacy,
educated in Paris and polished by great
latitude of travel, the attach         had the art of
small talk and the charm of story-telling. To
these recommendations, he added a slender, almost
military carriage, and the distinction of
Castilian features.

A punctured tire had interrupted the homeward
journey of Steele and Saxon, who had
telephoned to beg that the dinner go on, without
permitting their tardiness to delay the more
punctual.

The table was spread in a front room with
a balcony that gave an outlook across the broad
lawn and the ancient trees which bordered the
sidewalk. At the open windows, the May air
that stirred the curtains was warm enough to
suggest summer, and new enough after the
lately banished winter to seem wonderful       as
though the rebirth of nature had wrought its
miracle for the first time.

Ribero was the only guest who needed
[Pg 39]
presentation, and, as he bowed over the hand of
each woman, it was with an almost ornate ceremoniousness
of manner.

Duska Filson, after the spontaneous system
of her opinions and prejudices, disliked the
South American. To her imaginative mind,
there was something in his jetlike darkness and
his quick, almost tigerish movements that suggested
the satanic. But, if the impression she
received was not flattering to the guest, the impression
she made was evidently profound.
Ribero glanced at her with an expression of
extreme admiration, and dropped his dark
lashes as though he would veil eyes from which
he could not hope to banish flattery too fulsome
for new acquaintanceship.

The girl found herself seated with the diplomat
at her right, and a vacant chair at her
left. The second vacant seat was across the
round table, and she found herself sensible of
a feeling of quarantine with an uncongenial
companion, and wondering who would fill the
empty space at her left. The name on the
place card was hidden. She rather hoped it
would be Saxon. She meant to ask him why
[Pg 40]
he did not break away from the Marston influence
that handicapped his career, and she
believed he would entertain her. Of course,
George Steele was an old friend and a very dear
one, but this was just the point: he was not
satisfied with that, and in the guise of lovers
only did she ever find men uninteresting. It
would, however, be better to have George make
love than to be forced to talk to this somewhat
pompous foreigner.

       I just met and made obeisance to the new
Mrs. Billie Bedford,        declared Mr. Bellton,
starting the conversational ball rolling along the
well-worn groove of gossip.        And, if she
needs a witness, she may call on me to testify
that she       s as radiant in the part of Mrs. Billie
as she was in her former r       le of Mrs. Jack.       

Miss Buford raised her large eyes. With
a winter       s popularity behind her, she felt aggrieved
to hear mentioned names that she did
not know. Surely, she had met everybody.

       Who is Mrs. Bedford?        she demanded.
       I don       t think I have ever met her. Is she
a widow?       

Bellton laughed across his consomm         cup.
[Pg 41]
       Of the modern school,        he enlightened.
       There were        no funeral baked meats to furnish
forth the marriage feast.        Matrimonially
speaking, this charming lady plays in repertoire.       

       What has become of Jack Spotswood?       
The older Miss Preston glanced up inquiringly.
       He used to be everywhere, and I haven       t
heard of him for ages.       

       He       s still everywhere,        responded Mr.
Bellton, with energy;        everywhere but here.
You see, the papers were so busy with Jack       s
affairs that they crowded Jack out of his own
life.        Mr. Bellton smiled as he added:        And
so he went away.       

       I wonder where he is now. He wasn       t such
a bad sort,        testified Mr. Cleaver, solemnly.
       Jack       s worse portion was his better half.       

       Last heard,        informed Mr. Bellton,        he
was seen in some town in South America       the
name of which I forget.       

Se        or Ribero had no passport of familiarity
into local personalities, and he occupied the
moment of his own conversational disengagement
in a covert study of the face and figure
[Pg 42]
beside him. Just now, the girl was looking
away at the indolently stirring curtains with
an expression of detachment. Flippant gossip
was distasteful to her, and, when the current set
that way, she drew aside, and became the non-participant.

Ribero read rightly the bored expression, and
resolved that the topic must be diverted, if Miss
Filson so wished.

       One meets so many of your countrymen
in South America,        he suggested,        that one
might reasonably expect them to lose interest
as types, yet each of them seems to be the center
of some gripping interest. I remember in particular
one episode              

The recital was cut short by the entrance of
Steele and Saxon. Ribero, the only person
present requiring introduction, rose to shake
hands.





The attach         was trained in diplomacy, and the
rudiments of diplomacy should teach the face
to become a mask when need be, yet, as his eyes
met those of Saxon, he suddenly and involuntarily
stiffened. For just a moment, his outstretched
hand hesitated with the impulse to
[Pg 43]
draw back. The lips that had parted in a casual
smile hardened rigidly, and the eyes that
rested on the face of Steele       s celebrity were so
intently focused that they almost stared. The
byplay occupied only a moment, and, as Ribero
had half-turned from the table to greet those
entering at his back, it escaped the notice of
everyone except Saxon himself. The newcomer
felt the momentary bar of hostility that had
been thrown between them and as quickly withdrawn.
The next moment, he was shaking the
extended hand, and hearing the commonplace:

       Much pleased, se        or.       

Ribero felt a momentary flash of shame for
the betrayal of such undiplomatic surprise, and
made amends with added courtesy when he
spoke.

The artist, dropping into his seat at the side
of Miss Filson, felt a flush of pleasure at his
position. For the instant, the other man       s conduct
became a matter of negligible importance,
and, when she turned to him with a friendly
nod and smile, he forgot Ribero       s existence.

       Mr. Ribero,        announced Mr. Bellton,
       was just about to tell us an interesting story
[Pg 44]
when you two delinquents came in. I       m sure
he still has the floor.       

The diplomat had forgotten what he had
been saying. He was covertly studying the
features of the man just beyond Miss Filson.
The face was turned toward the girl, giving him
a full view, and it was a steady, imperturbable
face. Now, introduced as raconteur, he realized
that he must say something, and at the
moment, with a flash of inspiration, he determined
to relate a bit of history that would
be of interest at least to the narrator. It was
not at all the story he might have told had
he been uninterrupted, but it was a story that
appealed to his diplomatic taste, because he
could watch the other face as he told it and see
what the other face might betray. This newcomer
had jarred him from his usual poise.
Now, he fancied it was the other       s turn to be
startled.

       It was,        he said casually,        the narrowest
escape from death that I have seen       and the
man who escaped was an American.       

As Saxon raised his eyes, with polite interest,
to those of the speaker, he became aware that
[Pg 45]
they held for him a message of almost sardonic
challenge. He felt that the story-teller was
only ostensibly addressing the table; that the
man was talking at him, as a prosecutor talks
at the defendant though he may direct himself
to the jury. The sense that brought this realization
was perhaps telepathic. To the other
eyes and ears, there were only the manner of
the raconteur and the impersonal tone of generality.

       It occurred in Puerto Frio,        said the South
American, reminiscently. He paused for a moment,
and smiled at Saxon, as though expecting
a sign of confusion upon the mention of the
name, but he read only courteous interest and
impenetrability.

       This countryman of yours,        he went on
smoothly, his English touched and softened by
the accent of the foreigner,        had indulged in
the dangerous, though it would seem alluring,
pastime of promoting a revolution. Despite
his unscrupulous character, he was possessed of
an engaging personality, and, on brief acquaintance,
I, for one, liked him. His skill and luck
held good so long that it was only when the
[Pg 46]
insurgents were at the gates of the capital that
a summary court-martial gave him the verdict
of death. I have no doubt that by the laws
of war it was a just award, yet so many men
are guilty of peddling revolutions, and the demand
for such wares is so great in some quarters,
that he had my sympathy.        The speaker
bowed slightly, as though conceding a point to
a gallant adversary. It chanced that he was
looking directly at Saxon as he bowed.

The painter became suddenly conscious that
he was according an engrossed attention, and
that the story-teller was narrowly watching his
fingers as they twisted the stem of his sauterne
glass. The fingers became at once motionless.

       He bore himself so undeniably well when
he went out to his place against a blank wall
in the plaza, escorted by the firing squad,        proceeded
Se        or Ribero evenly,        that one could
not withhold admiration. The picture remains
with me. The sun on the yellow cathedral
wall ... a vine heavy with scarlet blossoms
like splashes of blood ... and twenty paces
away the firing squad with their Mausers.       

Once more, the speaker broke off, as though
[Pg 47]
lost in retrospection of something well-remembered.
Beyond the girl       s absorbed gaze, he
saw that of the painter, and his dark eyes for
an instant glittered with something like direct
accusation.

       As they arranged the final details, he must
have reflected somewhat grimly on the irony
of things, for at that very moment he could
hear the staccato popping of the guns he had
smuggled past the vigilance of the customs.
The sound was coming nearer       telling him
that in a half-hour his friends would be victorious       too
late to save him.       

As Ribero paused, little Miss Buford, leaning
forward across the table, gave a sort of gasp.

       He was tall, athletic, gray-eyed,        announced
the attach         irrelevantly;        in his eyes
dwelt something of the spirit of the dreamer.
He never faltered.       

The speaker lifted his sauterne glass to his
lips, and sipped the wine deliberately.

       The teniente in command inquired if he
wished to pray,        Ribero added then,        but he
shook his head almost savagely.        No, damn
you!        he snapped out, as though he were in a
[Pg 48]
hurry about it all,        Go on with your rat-killing.
Let       s have it over with.              

The raconteur halted in his narrative.

       Please go on,        begged Duska, in a low
voice.        What happened?       

The foreigner smiled.

       They fired.        Then, as he saw the slight
shudder of Duska       s white shoulder, he supplemented:
       But each soldier had left the
task for the others.... Possibly, they
sympathized with him; possibly, they sympathized
with the revolution; possibly, each
of the six secretly calculated that the other
five would be sufficient. Quien sabe? At all
events, he fell only slightly wounded. One
bullet               he spoke thoughtfully, letting his eyes
drop from Saxon       s face to the table-cloth where
Saxon       s right hand lay              one bullet pierced
his right hand from back to front.       

Then, a half-whimsical smile crossed Ribero       s
somewhat saturnine features, for Miss Filson
had dropped her napkin on Saxon       s side, and,
when the painter had stooped to recover it, he
did not again replace the hand on the table.

       Before he could be fired on a second
[Pg 49]
time,        concluded the diplomat with a shrug,
       a new presidente was on his way to the palace.
Your countryman was saved.       

If the hero of Ribero       s narrative was a malefactor,
at least he was a malefactor with the
sympathy of Mr. Bellton       s dinner-party, as was
attested by a distinctly audible sigh of relief
at the end of the story. But Se        or Ribero was
not quite through.

       It is not, after all, the story that discredits
your countryman,        he explained,        but the sequel.
Of course, he became powerful in the
new r        gime. It was when he was lauded as a
national hero that his high fortunes intoxicated
him, and success rotted his moral fiber. Eventually,
he embezzled a fortune from the government
which he had assisted to establish. There
was also a matter of       how shall I say?       of a
lady. Then, a duel which was really an assassination.
He escaped with blood on his conscience,
presumably to enjoy his stolen wealth
in his own land.       

       I have often wondered,        pursued Ribero,
       whether, if that man and I should ever be
thrown together again, he would know me ...
[Pg 50]
and I have often wished I could remember him
only as the brave adventurer       not also as the
criminal.       

As he finished, the speaker was holding Saxon
with his eyes, and had a question in his glance
that seemed to call for some expression from
the other. Saxon bowed with a smile.

       It is an engrossing story.       

       I think,        said Duska suddenly, almost critically,
       the first part was so good that it was a
pity to spoil it with the rest.       

Se        or Ribero smiled enigmatically into his
wine-glass.

       I fear, se        orita, that is the sad difference
between fiction and history. My tale is a true
one.       

       At all events,        continued the girl with
vigor,        he was a brave man. That is enough
to remember. I think it is better to forget the
rest.       

It seemed to Ribero that the glance Saxon
flashed on her was almost the glance of gratitude.

       What was his name?        she suddenly demanded.

[Pg 51]
       He called himself       at that time       George
Carter,        Ribero said slowly,        but gentlemen
in the unrecognized pursuits quite frequently
have occasion to change their names. Now, it
is probably something else.       

After the dinner had ended, while the guests
fell into groups or waited for belated carriages,
Saxon found himself standing apart, near the
window. It was open on the balcony, and the
man felt a sudden wish for the quiet freshness
of the outer air on his forehead. He drew
back the curtain, and stepped across the low sill,
then halted as he realized that he was not
alone.

The sputtering arc-light swinging over the
street made the intervening branches and leaves
of the sidewalk sycamores stand out starkly
black, like a ragged drop hung over a stage.

The May moon was only a thin sickle, and
the other figure on the darkly shadowed balcony
was vaguely defined, but Saxon at once recognized,
in its lithe slenderness and grace of pose,
Miss Filson.

       I didn       t mean to intrude,        he hastily apologized.
       I didn       t know you were here.       

[Pg 52]
She laughed.        Would that have frightened
you?        she asked.

She was leaning on the iron rail, and the man
took his place at her side.

       I came with the Longmores,        she explained,
       and their machine hasn       t come yet. It       s cool
here       and I was thinking              

       You weren       t by any chance thinking of
Babylon?        he laughed,        or Macedonia?       

She shook her head.        Mr. Ribero       s story
sticks in my mind. It was so personal, and       I
guess I       m a moody creature. Anyway, I
find myself thinking of it.       

There was silence for a space, except for the
laughter that floated up from the verandah below
them, where a few of the members sat
smoking, and the softened clicking of ivory
from the open windows of the billiard-room.
The painter       s fingers, resting on the iron rail,
closed over a tendril of clambering moon-flower
vine, and nervously twisted the stem.

With an impulsive movement, he leaned forward.
His voice was eager.

       Suppose,        he questioned,        suppose you
knew such a man       can you imagine any
[Pg 53]
circumstances under which you could make excuses
for him?       

She stood a moment weighing the problem.
       It       s a hard question,        she replied finally, then
added impulsively:        Do you know, I       m afraid
I       m a terrible heathen? I can excuse so much
where there is courage       the cold sort of chilled-steel
courage that he had. What do you
think?       

The painter drew his handkerchief from his
pocket, and wiped his moist forehead, but, before
he could frame his answer, the girl heard
a movement in the room, and turned lightly to
join her chaperon.

Following her, Saxon found himself saying
good-night to a group that included Ribero.
As the attach         shook hands, he held Saxon       s
somewhat longer than necessary, seeming to
glance at a ring, but really studying a scar.

       You are a good story-teller, Mr. Ribero,       
said Saxon, quietly.

       Ah,        countered the other quickly,        but
that is easy, se        or, where one has so good a
listener. By the way, se        or, did you ever
chance to visit Puerto Frio?       

[Pg 54]
The painter shook his head.

       Not unless in some other life       some life
as dead as that of the pharaohs.       

       Ah, well               the diplomat turned away, still
smiling              some of the pharaohs are remarkably
well preserved.       





[Pg 55]

CHAPTER IV


Steele himself had not been a failure at
his art. There was in him no want of that
sensitive temperament and dream-fire which
gives the artist, like the prophet, a better
sight and deeper appreciation than is accorded
the generality. The only note missing was the
necessity for hard application, which might
have made him the master where he was satisfied
to be the dilettante. The extreme cleverness
of his brush had at the outset been his
handicap, lulling the hard sincerity of effort
with too facile results. Wealth, too, had
drugged his energies, but had not crippled his
abilities. If he drifted, it was because drifting
in smooth seas is harmless and pleasant, not
because he was unseaworthy or fearful of
stormier conditions. In Saxon, he had not only
recognized a greater genius, but found a friend,
and with the insouciance of a graceful philosophy
he reasoned it out to his own contentment.
Each craft after its own uses! Saxon
[Pg 56]
was meant for a greater commerce. His genius
was intended to be an argosy, bearing rich
cargo between the ports of the gods and those
of men. If, in the fulfillment of that destiny,
the shallop of his own lesser talent and influence
might act as convoy and guide, luring
the greater craft into wider voyaging, he
would be satisfied. Just now, that guidance
ought to be away from the Marston influence
where lay ultimate danger and limitation. He
was glad that where people discussed Frederick
Marston they also discussed his foremost
disciple. Marston himself had loomed large
in the star-chart of painting only a dozen years
ago, and was now the greatest of luminaries.
His follower had been known less than half
that long. If he were to surpass the man he
was now content to follow, he must break away
from Marston-worship and let his maturer efforts
be his own       his ultimate style his own.
Prophets and artists have from the beginning
of time arisen from second place to a pre      minent
first       pupils have surpassed their teachers.
He had hoped that these months in a
new type of country and landscape would
[Pg 57]
slowly, almost insensibly, wean Saxon away
from the influence that had made his greatness
and now in turn threatened to limit its
scope.

The cabin to which he brought his guest was
itself a reflection of Steele       s whim. Fashioned
by its original and unimaginative builders
only as a shelter, with no thought of appearances,
it remained, with its dark logs and
white        chinking,        a thing of picturesque
beauty. Its generous stone chimneys and wide
hearths were reminders of the ancient days.
Across its shingled roof, the sunlight was spotted
with shadows thrown down from beeches
and oaks that had been old when the Indian
held the country and the buffalo gathered at
the salt licks. Vines of honeysuckle and morning-glory
had partly pre      mpted the walls. Inside
was the odd mingling of artistic junk that
characterizes the den of the painter.

Saxon       s enthusiasm had been growing that
morning since the automobile had left the city
behind and pointed its course toward the line
of knobs. The twenty-mile run had been a
panorama sparkling with the life of color,
[Pg 58]
tempered with tones of richness and soft with
haunting splendor. Forest trees, ancient as
Druids, were playing at being young in the almost
shrill greens of their leafage. There were
youth and opulence in the way they filtered
the sun through their gnarled branches with a
splattering and splashing of golden light.
Blossoming dogwood spread clusters of white
amid endless shades and conditions of green,
and, when the view was not focused into the
thickness of woodland interiors, it offered
leagues of yellow fields and tender meadows
stretching off to soberer woods in the distance.
Back of all that were the hills, going up from
the joyous sparkle of the middle distance to
veiled purple where they met the bluest of
skies. Saxon       s fingers had been tingling for a
brush to hold and his lids had been unconsciously
dropping, that his eyes might appraise
the colors in simplified tones and values.

At last, they had ensconced themselves, and
a little later Saxon emerged from the cabin
disreputably clad in a flannel shirt and briar-torn,
paint-spotted trousers. In his teeth, he
clamped a battered briar pipe, and in his hand
[Pg 59]
he carried an equally battered sketching-easel
and paint-box.

Steele, smoking a cigar in a hammock, looked
up from an art journal at the sound of a footstep
on the boards.

       Did you see this?        he inquired, holding
out the magazine.        It would appear that
your eccentric demi-god is painting in Southern
Spain. He continues to remain the recluse,
avoiding the public gaze. His genius seems
to be of the shrinking type. Here       s his latest
sensation as it looks to the camera.       

Saxon took the magazine, and studied the
half-tone reproduction.

       His miracle is his color,        announced the
first disciple, briefly.        The black and white
gives no idea. As to his personality, it seems
to be that of the poseur       almost of the snob.
His very penchant for frequent wanderings incognito
and revealing himself only through his
work is in itself a bid for publicity. He arrogates
to himself the attributes of traveling
royalty. For my master as the man, I have
small patience. It       s the same affectation that
causes him to sign nothing. The arrogant
[Pg 60]
confidence that no one can counterfeit his
stroke, that signature is superfluous.       

Steele laughed.

       Why not show him that some one can do
it?        he suggested.        Why not send over an
unsigned canvas as a Marston, and drag him
out of his hiding place to assert himself and
denounce the impostor?       

       Let him have his vanities,        Saxon said,
almost contemptuously.        So long as the world
has his art, what does it matter?        He turned
and stepped from the low porch, whistling as
he went.

The stranger strolled along with a free
stride and confident bearing, tempted by each
vista, yet always lured on by other vistas beyond.

At last, he halted near a cluster of huge
boulders. Below him, the creek reflected in
rippled counterpart the shimmer of overhanging
greenery. Out of a tangle of undergrowth
beyond reared two slender poplars. The middle
distance was bright with young barley, and
in the background stretched the hills in misty
purple.

[Pg 61]
There, he set up his easel, and, while his eyes
wandered, his fingers were selecting the color
tubes with the deft accuracy of the pianist       s
touch on the keys.

For a time, he saw only the thing he was to
paint; then, there rose before his eyes the face
of a girl, and beyond it the sinister visage of
the South American. His brow darkened. Always,
there had lurked in the background of
his thoughts a specter, some Nemesis who
might at any moment come forward, bearing
black reminders       possible accusations. At last,
it seemed the specter had come out of the
shadow, and taken the center of the stage, and
in the spotlight he wore the features of Se        or
Ribero. He had intended questioning Ribero,
but had hesitated. The thing had been sudden,
and it is humiliating to go to a man one
has never met before to learn something of
one       s self, when that man has assumed an attitude
almost brutally hostile from the outset.
The method must first be considered, and, when
early that morning he had inquired about the
diplomat, it had been to learn that a night train
had taken the man to his legation in
[Pg 62]
Washington. He must give the problem in its new
guise reflection, and, meanwhile, he must live in
the shadow of its possible tragedy.

There was no element of the coward       s procrastination
in Saxon       s thoughts. Even his
own speculation as to what the other man
might have been, had never suggested the possibility
that he was a craven.

He held up his hand, and studied the scar.
The bared forearm, under the uprolled sleeve,
was as brown and steady as a sculptor       s work
in bronze.

Suddenly, he heard a laugh at his back, a
tuneful laugh like a trill struck from a xylophone,
and came to his feet with a realization
of a blue gingham dress, a girlish figure, a sunbonnet
and a huge cluster of dogwood blossoms.
The sunbonnet and dogwood branches
seemed conspiring to hide all the face except
the violet eyes that looked out from them.
Near by stood a fox terrier, silently and alertly
regarding him, its head cocked jauntily to the
side.

But, even before she had lowered the dogwood
blossoms enough to reveal her face, the
[Pg 63]
lancelike uprightness of her carriage brought
recognition and astonishment.

       Do you mind my staring at you?        she demanded,
innocently.        Isn       t turn-about fair
play?       

       But, Miss Filson,        he stammered,        I       I
thought you lived in town!       

       Then, George didn       t tell you that we were
to be the closest sort of neighbors?        The
merriment of her laugh was spontaneous. She
did not confide to Saxon just why Steele       s silence
struck her as highly humorous. She
knew, however, that the place had originally
recommended itself to its purchaser by reason
of just that exact circumstance       its proximity.

The man took a hasty step forward, and
spoke with the brusqueness of a cross-examiner:

       No. Why didn       t he tell me? He should
have told me! He               He halted abruptly,
conscious that his manner was one of resentment
for being led, unwarned, into displeasing
surroundings, which was not at all what
he meant. Then, as the radiant smile on the
girl       s face       the smile such as a very little girl
might have worn in the delight of perpetrating
[Pg 64]
an innocent surprise       suddenly faded into a
pained wonderment, he realized the depth of
his crudeness. Of course, she could not know
that he had come there to run away, to seek
asylum. She could not guess, that, in the isolation
of such a life as his uncertainty entailed,
associates like herself were the most hazardous;
that, because she seemed to him altogether
wonderful, he distrusted his power to quarantine
his heart against her artless magnetism.
As he stood abashed at his own crassness, he
wanted to tell her that he developed these
crude strains only when he was thrown into
touch with so fine grained a nature as her own;
that it was the very sense of his own pariah-like
circumstance. Then, before she had time
to speak, came a swift artistic leaping at his
heart. He should have known that she would
be here! It was her rightful environment!
She belonged as inherently under blossoming
dogwood branches as the stars belong beyond
the taint of earth-smoke. She was a dryad,
and these were her woods. After all, how
could it matter? He had run away bravely.
Now, she was here also, and the burden of
[Pg 65]
responsibility might rest on the woodsprites or
the gods or his horoscope or wherever it belonged.
As for himself, he would enjoy the
present. The future was with destiny. Of
course, friendship is safe so long as love is
barred, and of course it would be only friendship!
Does the sun shine anywhere on trellised
vines with a more golden light than where
the slopes of Vesuvius bask just below the
smoking sands? He, too, would enjoy the radiance,
and risk the crater.

She stood, not angry, but a trifle bewildered,
a trifle proud in her attitude of uptilted chin.
In all her little autocratic world, her gracious
friendliness had never before met anything so
like rebuff.

Then, having resolved, the man felt an almost
boyish reaction to light-hearted gayety.
It was much the same gay abandonment that
comes to a man who, having faced ruin until
his heart and brain are sick, suddenly decides
to squander in extravagant and riotous pleasure
the few dollars left in his pocket.

       Of course, George should have told me,       
he declared.        Why, Miss Filson, I come
[Pg 66]
from the world where things are commonplace,
and here it all seems a sequence of wonders:
this glorious country, the miracle of meeting
you again       after               he paused, then smilingly
added              after Babylon and Macedonia.       

       From the way you greeted me,        she
na      vely observed,        one might have fancied
that you       d been running away ever since we
parted in Babylon and Macedon. You must
be very tired.       

       I am afraid of you,        he avowed.

She laughed.

       I know you are a woman-hater. But I
was a boy myself until I was seventeen. I       ve
never quite got used to being a woman, so you
needn       t mind.       

       Miss Filson,        he hazarded gravely,        when
I saw you yesterday, I wanted to be friends
with you so much that       that I ran away.
Some day, I       ll tell you why.       

For a moment, she looked at him with a puzzled
interest. The light of a smile dies slowly
from most faces. It went out of his eyes as
suddenly as an electric bulb switched off, leaving
the features those of a much older man.
[Pg 67]
She caught the look, and in her wisdom said
nothing       but wondered what he meant.

Her eyes fell on the empty canvas.        How
did you happen to begin art?        she inquired.
       Did you always feel it calling you?       

He shook his head, then the smile came back.

       A freezing cow started me,        he announced.

       A what?        Her eyes were once more puzzled.

       You see,        he elucidated,        I was a cow-puncher
in Montana, without money. One
winter, the snow covered the prairies so long
that the cattle were starving at their grazing
places. Usually, the breeze from the Japanese
current blows off the snow from time to
time, and we can graze the steers all winter on
the range. This time, the Japanese current
seemed to have been switched off, and they
were dying on the snow-bound pastures.       

       Yes,        she prompted.        But how did
that       ?       

       You see,        he went on,        the boss wrote
from Helena to know how things were going.
I drew a picture of a freezing, starving cow,
and wrote back,        This is how.        The boss
[Pg 68]
showed that picture around, and some folk
thought it bore so much family resemblance to
a starving cow that on the strength of it they
gambled on me. They staked me to an education
in illustrating and painting.       

       And you made good!        she concluded, enthusiastically.

       I hope to make good,        he smiled.

After a pause, she said:

       If you were not busy, I       d guide you to
some places along the creek where there are
wonderful things to see.       

The man reached for his discarded hat.

       Take me there,        he begged.

       Where?        she demanded.        I spoke of
several places.       

       To any of them,        he promptly replied;
       better yet, to all of them.       

She shook her head dubiously.

       I ought not to begin as an interruption,       
she demurred.

       On the contrary,        he argued confidently,
       the good general first acquaints himself with
his field.       

An hour later, standing at a gap in a tangle
[Pg 69]
of briar, where the paw-paw trees grew thick,
he watched her crossing the meadow toward
the roof of her house which topped the foliage
not far away. Then, he held up his right hand,
and scrutinized the scar, almost invisible under
the tan. It seemed to him to grow larger as
he looked.





[Pg 70]

CHAPTER V


Horton House, where Duska Filson made
her home with her aunt and uncle, was a half-mile
from the cabin in which the two painters
were lodged. That was the distance reckoned
via driveway and turnpike, but a path, linking
the houses, reduced it to a quarter of a mile.
This        air line,        as Steele dubbed it, led from
the hill where the cabin perched, through a
blackberry thicket and paw-paw grove, across
a meadow, and then entered, by a picket gate
and rose-cumbered fence, the old-fashioned
garden of the        big house.       

Before the men had been long at their summer
place, the path had become as well worn
as neighborly paths should be. To the gracious
household at Horton House, they were
       the boys.        Steele had been on lifelong
terms of intimacy, and the guest was at once
taken into the family on the same basis as the
host.

       Horton House        was a temple dedicated
[Pg 71]
to hospitality. Mrs. Horton, its delightful
mistress, occasionally smiled at the somewhat
pretentious name, but it had been        Horton
House        when the Nashville stage rumbled
along the turnpike, and the picturesque little
village of brick and stone at its back had been
the        quarters        for the slaves. It would no
more do to rechristen it than to banish the ripened
old family portraits, or replace the silver-laden
mahogany sideboard with less antique
things. The house had been added to from
time to time, until it sprawled a commodious
and composite record of various eras, but the
name and spirit stood the same.

Saxon began to feel that he had never lived
before. His life, in so far as he could remember
it, had been varied, but always touched
with isolation. Now, in a family not his own,
he was finding the things which had hitherto
been only names to him and that richness of
congenial companionship which differentiates
life from existence. While he felt the wine-like
warmth of it in his heart, he felt its seductiveness
in his brain. The thought of its
ephemeral quality brought him moments of
[Pg 72]
depression that drove him stalking away alone
into the hills to fight things out with himself.
At times, his canvases took on a new glow;
at times, he told himself he was painting daubs.

About a week after their arrival, Mrs. Horton
and Miss Filson came over to inspect the
quarters and to see whether bachelor efforts
had made the place habitable.

Duska was as delighted as a child among
new toys. Her eyes grew luminous with
pleasure as she stood in the living-room of the
       shack        and surveyed the confusion of canvases,
charcoal sketches and studio paraphernalia
that littered its walls and floor. Saxon
had hung his canvases in galleries where the
juries were accounted sternly critical; he had
heard the commendation of brother artists generously
admitting his precedence. Now, he
found himself almost flutteringly anxious to hear
from her lips the pronouncement,        Well done.       

Mrs. Horton, meanwhile, was sternly and
beneficently inspecting the premises from living-room
to pantry, with Steele as convoy, and
Saxon was left alone with the girl.

As he brought canvas after canvas from
[Pg 73]
various unturned piles and placed them in a
favorable light, he found one at whose vivid
glow and masterful execution, his critic caught
her breath in a delighted little gasp.

It was a thing done in daring colors and almost
blazing with the glare of an equatorial
sun. An old cathedral, partly vine-covered,
reared its yellowed walls and towers into a hot
sky. The sun beat cruelly down on the cobbled
street while a clump of ragged palms gave
the contrasting key of shade.

Duska, half-closing her eyes, gazed at it
with uptilted chin resting on slender fingers.
For a time, she did not speak, but the man read
her delight in her eyes. At last, she said, her
voice low with appreciation:

       I love it!       

Turning away to take up a new picture, he
felt as though he had received an accolade.

       It might have been the very spot,        she
said thoughtfully,        that Se        or Ribero described
in his story.       

Saxon felt a cloud sweep over the sunshine
shed by her praise. His back was turned, but
his face grew suddenly almost gray.

[Pg 74]
The girl only heard him say quietly:

       Se        or Ribero spoke of South America.
This was in Yucatan.       

When the last canvas had been criticized,
Saxon led the girl out to the shaded verandah.

       Do you know,        she announced with severe
directness,        when I know you just a little better,
I       m going to lecture you?       

       Lecture me!        His face mirrored alarm.
       Do it now       then, I sha       n       t have it impending
to terrorize better acquaintance.       

She gazed away for a time, her eyes clouding
with doubt. At last, she laughed.

       It makes me seem foolish,        she confessed,
       because you know so much more than I do
about the subject of this lecture       only,        she
added with conviction,        the little I know is
right, and the great deal you know may be
wrong.       

       I plead guilty, and throw myself on the
mercy of the court.        He made the declaration
in a tone of extreme abjectness.

       But I don       t want you to plead guilty. I
want you to reform.       

Not knowing the nature of the reform required,
Saxon remained discreetly speechless.

[Pg 75]
       You are the first disciple of Frederick
Marston,        she said, going to the point without
preliminaries.        You don       t have to be anybody       s
disciple. I don       t know a great deal
about art, but I       ve stood before Marston       s pictures
in the galleries abroad and in this country.
I love them. I       ve seen your pictures, too,
and you don       t have to play tag with Frederick
Marston.       

For a moment, Saxon sat twisting his pipe
in his fingers. His silence might almost have
been an ungracious refusal to discuss the matter.

       Oh, I know it       s sacrilege,        she said, leaning
forward eagerly, her eyes deep in their
sincerity,        but it       s true.       

The man rose and paced back and forth for
a moment, then halted before her. When he
spoke, it was with a ring like fanaticism in his
voice.

       There is no Art but Art, and Marston is
her prophet. That is my Koran of the palette.       
For a while, she said nothing, but shook
her head with a dissenting smile, which carried
up the corners of her lips in maddeningly
delicious fashion. Then, the man went on,
[Pg 76]
speaking now slowly and in measured syllables:

       Some day       when I can tell you my whole
story       you will know what Marston means to
me. What little I have done, I have done in
stumbling after him. If I ever attain his perfection,
I shall still be as you say only the copyist       yet,
I sometimes think I would rather be
the true copyist of Marston than the originator
of any other school.       

She sat listening, the toe of one small foot
tapping the floor below the short skirt of her
gown, her brow delightfully puckered with
seriousness. A shaft of sun struck the delicate
color of her cheeks, and discovered coppery
glints in her brown hair. She was very slim
and wonderful, Saxon thought, and out beyond
the vines the summer seemed to set the world
for her, like a stage. The birds with tuneful
delirium provided the orchestration.

       I know just how great he is,        she conceded
warmly;        I know how wonderfully he paints.
He is a poet with a brush for a pen. But
there       s one thing he lacks       and that is a thing
you have.       

[Pg 77]
The man raised his brows in challenged astonishment.

       It       s the one thing I miss in his pictures,
because it       s the one thing I most admire       strength,
virility.        She was talking more rapidly
as her enthusiasm gathered headway.        A
man       s pictures are, in a way, portraits of his
nature. He can       t paint strong things unless
he is strong himself.       

Saxon felt his heart leap. It was something
to know that she believed his canvases reflected
a quality of strength inherent to himself.

       You and your master,        she went on,        are
unlike in everything except your style. Can
you fancy yourself hiding away from the
world because you couldn       t face the music of
your own fame? That       s not modesty       it       s insanity.
When I was in Paris, everybody was
raving about some new pictures from his
brush, but only his agent knew where he actually
was, or where he had been for years.       

       For the man,        he acceded,        I have as
small respect as you can have, but for the work
I have something like worship! I began trying
to paint, and I was groping       groping
[Pg 78]
rather blindly after something       I didn       t know
just what. Then, one day, I stood before his
       Winter Sunset.        You know the picture?       
She nodded assent.        Well, when I saw it, I
wanted to go out to the Metropolitan entrance,
and shout Eureka up and down Fifth Avenue.
It told me what I       d been reaching through the
darkness of my novitiate to grasp. It seemed
to me that art had been revealed to me. Somehow,       
the man added, his voice falling suddenly
from its enthused pitch to a dead, low
one,        everything that comes to me seems to
come by revelation!       

Into Duska       s eyes came quick light of sympathy.
He had halted before her, and now she
arose impulsively, and laid a light hand for a
moment on his arm.

       I understand,        she agreed.        I think that
for most artists to come as close as you have
come would be triumph enough, but you               she
looked at him a moment with a warmth of confidence              you
can do a great deal more.        So
ended her first lesson in the independence of
art, leaving the pupil       s heart beating more
quickly than at its commencement.

[Pg 79]
In the days that followed, as May gave way
to June and the dogwood blossoms dropped
and withered to be supplanted by flowering locust
trees, Saxon confessed to himself that he
had lost the first battle of his campaign. He
had resolved that this close companionship
should be platonically hedged about; that he
would never allow himself to cross the frontier
that divided the realm of friendship from
the hazardous territory of love. Then, as the
cool, unperfumed beauty of the dogwood was
forgotten for the sense-steeping fragrance of
the locust, he knew that he was only trying to
deceive himself. He had really crossed this
forbidden frontier when he passed through
the gate that separated the grandstand at
Churchill Downs from the club-house inclosure.
With the realization came the resolution
of silence. He was a man whose life might
at any moment renew itself in untoward developments.
Until he could drag the truth
from the sphinx that guarded his secret, his
love must be as inarticulate as was his sphinx.
He spent harrowing afternoons alone, and
swore with many solemn oaths that he would
[Pg 80]
never divulge his feelings, and, when he sought
about for the most sacred and binding of vows,
he swore by his love for Duska.

Because of these things, he sometimes
shocked and startled her with sporadic demonstrations
of the brusquerie into which he withdrew
when he felt too potential an impulse urging
him to the other extreme. And she, not
understanding it, yet felt that there was some
riddle behind it all. It pained and puzzled
her, but she accepted it without resentment       belying
her customary autocracy. While she
had never gone into the confessional of her
heart as he had done, these matters sometimes
had the power of making her very miserable.

His happiest achievements resulted from
sketching trips taken to points she knew in the
hills. He had called her a dryad when she
first appeared in the woods, and he had been
right, for she knew all the twisting paths in
the tangle of the knobs, unbroken and virgin
save where the orchards of peach-growers had
reclaimed bits of sloping soil. One morning
at the end of June, they started out together on
horseback, armed with painting paraphernalia,
[Pg 81]
luncheon and rubber ponchos in the event of
rain. For this occasion, she had saved a coign
of vantage she knew, where his artist       s eye
might swing out from a shelving cliff over
miles of checkered valley and flat, and league
upon league of cloud and sky. She led the
way by zigzag hill roads where they caught
stinging blows from back-lashing branches and
up steep, slippery acclivities. It was one of
the times when Saxon was drinking the pleasant
nectar of to-day, refusing to think of to-morrow.
She sang as she rode in advance, and
he followed with the pleasure of a man to
whom being unmounted brings a sense of incompleteness.
He knew that he rode no better
than she       and he knew that he could ride.
In his ears was the exuberance of the birds saluting
the morning, and in his nostrils the loamy
aroma stirred by their horses        hoofs from the
steeping fragrance of last year       s leaves. At
the end was a view that brought his breath in
deep draughts of delight.

For two hours, he worked, and only once
his eyes left the front. On that occasion, he
glanced back to see her slim figure stretched
[Pg 82]
with childlike and unconscious grace in the
long grass, her eyes gazing unblinkingly and
thoughtfully up to the fleece that drifted across
the blue of the sky. Clover heads waved fragrantly
about her, and one long-stemmed blossom
brushed her cheek. She did not see him,
and the man turned his gaze back to the canvas
with a leap in his pulses. After that, he
painted feverishly. Finally, he turned to find
her at his elbow.

       What is the verdict?        he demanded.

She looked with almost tense eyes. Her
voice was low and thrilled with wondering delight.

       There is something,        she said slowly,
       that you never caught before; something
wonderful, almost magical. I don       t know
what it is.       

With a swift, uncontrollable gesture, he bent
a little toward her. His face was the face of
a man whose heart is in insurrection. His voice
was impassioned.

       I know what it is,        he cried. Then, as she
read his look, her cheeks crimsoned, and it would
have been superfluous for him to have added,
[Pg 83]
       Love.        He drew back almost with a start,
and began to scrape the paint smears from his
palette. He had quelled the insurrection. At
least in words, he had not broken his vow.

For a moment, the girl stood silent. She felt
herself trembling; then, taking refuge in childlike
inconsequence, she peered over the edge
of the cliff.

       Oh!        she exclaimed as though the last few
moments had not been lived through,        there
is the most wonderfulest flower!        Her voice
was disappointment-laden.        And it       s just out
of reach.       

Saxon had regained control of himself. He
answered with a composure too calm to be genuine
and an almost flippant note that rang
false.

       Of course. The most wonderfulest things
are always just out of reach. The edelweiss
grows only among the glaciers, and the excelsior
crop must be harvested on inaccessible pinnacles.       

He came and looked over the edge, stopping
close to her shoulder. He wanted to demonstrate
his regained command of himself. A
[Pg 84]
delicate purple flower hung on the cliff below
as though it had been placed there to lure men
over the edge.

He looked down the sheer drop, appraised
with his eye the frail support of a jutting root,
then slipped quietly over, resting by his arms
on the ledge of rock and groping for the root
with his toe.

With a short, gasping exclamation, the girl
bent forward and seized both his elbows. Her
fingers clutched him with a strength belied by
their tapering slenderness.

       What are you doing?        she demanded.

She was kneeling on the ledge, and in her
eyes, only a few inches from his own, he read,
not only alarm, but back of that in the depths of
the pupils something else. It might have been
the reflection of what she had a few moments
before read in his own. He could feel the soft
play of her breath on his forehead, and his
heart pounded so wildly that it seemed to him
he must raise his voice to be heard above it.
Yet, his words and smile were sane.

       I am going to gather flowers,        he assured
her.        You see,        he added with an irrelevant
[Pg 85]
whimsicality,        I want to see if the unattainable
is really beyond me.       

       If you go,        she said with ominous quietness
of voice,        I shall come, too.       

The man clambered back to the ledge.
       I       m not going,        he announced.

For a time, neither spoke. Each, with a consciousness
of being much shaken, was seeking
about for the safe ground of commonplace.
The man       s face had suddenly become almost
drawn. He was conscious of having been too
close to the edge in more ways than one, and
with the consciousness came the old sense of
necessity for silence. He was approaching
one of the moods that puzzled the girl: the
attitude of fighting her off; the turtle       s churlish
defense of drawing into himself.

It was Duska who spoke first. She laughed
as she said lightly:

       For a man who is a great artist, you are
really very young and very silly.       

His voice was hard.

       I       m worse than that,        he acceded.

For a moment more, there was awkward silence;
then, Duska asked simply:

[Pg 86]
       Aren       t you going to paint any more?       

He was gazing at the canvas moodily, almost
savagely.

       No,        he answered shortly;        if I were to
touch it now, I should ruin it.       

The girl said nothing. She half-turned away
from him, and her lips set themselves tightly.

As he began packing the impedimenta,
storm-pregnant clouds rolled swiftly forth over
the valley, and emptied themselves in a deluge
on the two wanderers. The girl, riding under
dripping trees, her poncho and        nor       wester       
shining like metal under the slanting lines of
rain, went on ahead. In her man       s saddle, she
sat almost rigidly erect, and the gauntleted
hand that held the reins of the heavy cavalry
bridle clutched them with unconscious tautness
of grip. Saxon       s face was a picture of struggle,
and neither spoke until they had come to
the road at the base of the hill where two
horses could go abreast. Then, he found himself
quoting:



       Her hand was still on her sword hilt, the spur was still on her heel,
She had not cast her harness of gray war-dinted steel;
[Pg 87]
High on her red-splashed charger, beautiful, bold and browned,
Bright-eyed out of the battle, the Young Queen rode to be crowned.       



He did not realize that he had repeated the
lines aloud, until she turned her face and spoke
with something nearer to bitterness than he
had ever heard in her voice:

       Rode to be crowned       did you say?        And
she laughed unhappily.





[Pg 88]

CHAPTER VI


For more than a week after the ride to the
cliff, Duska withdrew herself from the orbit
in which Saxon revolved, and the man, feeling
that she wished to dismiss him, in part at
least, used the        air line        much less frequently
than in the days that had been. Once, when
Steele had left the cabin early to dine at the
       big house,        Saxon protested that he must
stay and write letters. He slipped away, however,
in the summer starlight, and took one of
the canoes from the boat-house on the river.
He drove the light craft as noiselessly and
gloomily as a funeral barge along the shadow
of the bank, the victim of utter misery, and his
blackness of mood was intensified when he saw
a second canoe pass in mid-channel, and recognized
Steele       s tenor in the drifting strains of a
sentimental song. There was no moon, and the
river was only a black mirror for the stars.
The tree-grown banks were blacker fringes of
shadow, but he could make out a slender figure
wielding the stern paddle with an easy grace
[Pg 89]
which he knew was Duska       s. His sentiment
was in no wise jealousy, but it was in every wise
heart-hunger.

When they did meet, she was cordial and
friendly, but the old intimate r        gime had been
disturbed, and for the man the sun was clouded.
He was to send a consignment of pictures to
his Eastern agent for exhibition and sale, and
he wished to include several of the landscapes
he had painted since his arrival at the cabin.
Finding creative work impossible, he devoted
himself to that touching up and varnishing
which is largely mechanical, and made frequent
trips to town for the selection of frames.

So much of his time had been spent at Horton
House that unbroken absence would have been
noticeable. His visits were, however, rarer,
and on one occasion Mrs. Horton made an announcement
which he found decidedly startling.

       I have been wanting to take a trip to Cuba
early in the fall, and possibly go on to Venezuela
where some old friends are in the diplomatic
service,        she said,        but Mr. Horton
pleads business, and I can       t persuade Duska to
go with me.       

[Pg 90]
At once, Steele had taken up the project with
enthusiasm, asking to be admitted to the party
and beginning an outline of plans.

Saxon found himself shuddering at the idea
of the girl       s going to the coast where perhaps
he himself had a criminal record. He had
procrastinated too long. He had secretly
planned his own trip of self-investigation for
a time when the equatorial heat had begun to
abate its midsummer ferocity. Evidently, he
must hasten his departure. But the girl       s answer
in part reassured him.

       It doesn       t appeal, Aunty. Why not get
the Longmores? They are always ready to go
touring. They       ve exhausted the far East, and
are weeping for new worlds.       

Saxon went back early that night, and once
more tramped the woods. Steele lingered, and
later, while the whippoorwills were calling and
a small owl plaintively lamenting, he and Duska
sat alone on the white-columned verandah.

       Duska,        he said suddenly,        is there no
chance for me       no little outside chance?       

She looked up, and shook her head slowly.

       I wish I could say something else, George,       
[Pg 91]
she answered earnestly,        because I love you as
a very dearest brother and friend, but that is
all it can ever be.       

       Is there no way I can remake or remold
myself?        he urged.        I have held the Platonic
attitude all summer, but to-night makes
all the old uncontrollable thoughts rise up and
clamor for expression. Is there no way?       

       George              her voice was very soft              it
hurts me to hurt you       but I       d have to lie to you
if I said there was a way. There can       t be       ever.       

       Is there any       any new reason?        he asked.

For a moment, she hesitated in silence, and
the man bent forward.

       I shouldn       t have asked that, Duska       I don       t
ask it,        he hastened to amend.        Whether
there is a new reason or just all the old ones,
is there any way I can help       any way, leaving
myself out of it, of course?       

Again, she shook her head.

       I guess there       s no way anyone can help,       
she said.

Back at the cabin, Steele found his guest
moodily pacing the verandah. The glow of his
[Pg 92]
pipe bowl was a point of red against the black.
The Kentuckian dropped into a chair, and for
a time neither spoke.

At last, Steele said slowly:

       Bob, I have just asked Duska if I had a
chance.       

The other man wheeled in astonishment.
Steele had indeed maintained his Platonic pose
so well that the other had not suspected the
fire under what he believed to be an extinct
crater. His own feeling had been the one
thing he had not confided. They had never
spoken to each other of Duska in terms of love.

       You!        he said, dully.        I didn       t know              

Steele rose. With his hand on the door-knob,
he paused.

       Bob,        he said,        the answer was the old
one. It       s also been,        No.        I       ve had my
chance. Of course, I really knew it all the
while, and yet I had to ask once more. I
sha       n       t ask again. It hurts her       and I want
to see her happy.        He turned and went in,
closing the door behind him.

But Duska was far from happy, however
much Steele and others might wish to see her
so. She spent much time in solitary rides and
[Pg 93]
walks. She knew now that she loved Saxon,
and she knew that he had shown in every wordless
way that he loved her, yet could she be
mistaken? Would he ever speak, since he had
not spoken at the cliff? Her own eyes had held
a declaration, and she had read in his that he
understood the message. His silence at that
time must be taken to mean silence for all time.

Saxon had reached his conclusion. He knew
that he had hurt her pride, had rejected his opportunity.
But that might be a transient grief
for her. For him, it would of course be permanent.
Men may love at twenty, and recover
and love again, even to the number of many
times, but to live to the age which he guessed
his years would total, and then love as he did,
was irremediable. For just that reason, he
must remain silent, and must go away. To enter
her life by the gate she seemed willing to
open for him would mean the taking into that
sacred inclosure of every hideous possibility
that clouded his own future. He must not enter
the gate, and, in order to be sure that a second
mad impulse would not drive him through it,
he must put distance between himself and the
gate.

[Pg 94]
On one point, he temporized. He was eager
to do one piece of work that should be his
masterpiece. The greatest achievement of his
art life must be her portrait. He wanted to
paint it, not in the conventional evening-gown
in which she seemed a young queen among
women, but in the environment that he liked
to think was her own by divine right. It was
the dryad that he sought to put on canvas.

He asked her with so much genuine pleading
in his voice that she smilingly consented,
and the sittings began in the old-fashioned garden
at Horton House. She was posed under
a spread of branches and in such a position that
the sun struck down through the leaves, kissing
into color her cheeks and eyes and hair. It
was a pose that called for a daring palette,
one which, if he succeeded in getting on his canvas
what he felt, would give a result whereon
he might well rest his reputation. But to him
it meant more than just that, for it was giving
expression to what he saw through his love of
art and his art of love.

The hours given to the first sittings were silent
hours, but that was not remarkable. Saxon
[Pg 95]
always worked in silence, though there were
times when he painted with gritted teeth because
of thoughts he read in the face he was
studying       thoughts which the model did not
know her face revealed. At times, Mrs. Horton
sat in the shade near by, and watched the
hand that nursed the canvas with its brush, the
steady, bare forearm that needed no mahlstick
for support and the eyes that were narrowed
to slits as he studied his tones and wide
as he painted. Sometimes, Steele lingered near
with a novel which he read aloud, but it happened
that in the final sittings there was no one
save painter and model.

It was now late in July, and the canvas had
begun to take form with a miraculous quality
and glow. Perhaps, the man himself did not
realize that he could never again paint such a
portrait, or any landscape that would be comparable
with it. Some men write love-letters
that are wonderful heart documents, but they
write them in black and white, with words.
Saxon was not only writing a love-letter, but
was painting all that his resolve did not let him
say. He was putting into the work pent-up
[Pg 96]
love of such force that it was almost bursting
his heart. Here on canvas as through some
wonderful safety-valve, he was passionately
converting it all into the vivid eloquence of
color.

It had been his fancy, since the picture had
become something more than a strong, preliminary
sketch, that Duska should not see it until
it neared completion, and she, wishing to have
her impression one unspoiled by foretastes, had
assented to the idea. Each day after the posing
ended, and while he rested, and let her rest,
the face of the canvas was covered with another
which was blank. Finally came the time
to ask her opinion. The afternoon light had
begun to change with the hint of lengthening
shadows. The out-door world was aglow with
gracious weather and the air had the wonderful,
almost pathetic softness that sometimes
comes to Kentucky for a few days in July,
bringing, as it seems, a fragment strayed out of
Indian Summer and lost in the mid-heat of the
year.

The man stood back and covered the portrait,
then, when the girl had seated herself before
[Pg 97]
the easel, he stepped forward, and laid his hand
on the covering. He hesitated a moment, and
his fingers on the blank canvas trembled. He
was unveiling the effort of his life, and to him
she was the world. If he had failed! Then,
with a deft movement, he lifted the concealing
canvas, and waited.

For a moment, the girl looked with bated
breath, then something between a groan and a
stifled cry escaped her. She turned her eyes
to him, and rose unsteadily from her seat. Her
hands went to her breast, and she wavered as
though she would fall. Saxon was at her side
in a moment, and, as he supported her, he felt
her arm tremble.

       Are you ill?        he asked, in a frightened
voice.

She shook her head, and smiled. She had
read the love-letters, and she had read, too,
what silence must cost him. Other persons
might see only wonderful art in the portrait,
but she saw all the rest, and, because she saw it,
silence seemed futile.

       It is a miracle!        she whispered.

The man stood for a moment at her side,
[Pg 98]
then his face became gray, and he half-wheeled
and covered it with his hands.

The girl took a quick step to his side, and her
young hands were on his shoulders.

       What is it, dear?        she asked.

With an exclamation that stood for the
breaking of all the dykes he had been building
and fortifying and strengthening through the
past months, he closed his arms around her,
and crushed her to him.

For a moment, he was oblivious of every
lesser thing. The past, the future had no existence.
Only the present was alive and vital and
in love. There was no world but the garden,
and that world was flooded with the sun and
the light of love. The present could not conceivably
give way to other times before or after.
It was like the hills that looked down       unchangeable
to the end of things!

Nothing else could count       could matter.
The human heart and human brain could not
harbor meaner thoughts. She loved him. She
was in his arms, therefore his arms circled the
universe. Her breath was on his face, and life
was good.

Then came the shock of realization. His
[Pg 99]
sphinx rose before him       not a sphinx that kept
the secrets of forty dead centuries, but one that
held in cryptic silence all the future. He could
not offer a love tainted with such peril without
explaining how tainted it was. Now, he must
tell her everything.

       I love you,        he found himself repeating
over and over;        I love you.       

He heard her voice, through singing stars:

       I love you. I have never said that to anyone
else       never until now. And,        she added
proudly,        I shall never say it again       except to
you.       

In his heart rose a torrent of rebellion. To
tell her now       to poison her present moment,
wonderful with the happiness of surrender       would
be cruel, brutal. He, too, had the right
to his hour of happiness, to a life of happiness!
In the strength of his exaltation, it seemed to
him that he could force fate to surrender his
secret. He would settle things without making
her a sharer in the knowledge that peril shadowed
their love. He would find a way!

Standing there with her close to his heart,
and her own palpitating against his breast, he
felt more than a match for mere facts and
[Pg 100]
conditions. It seemed ridiculous that he had allowed
things to bar his way so long. Now, he
was thrice armed, and must triumph!

       I know now why the world was made,        he
declared, joyfully.        I know why all the other
wonderful women and all the other wonderful
loves from the beginning of time have been!
It was,        he announced with the supreme egotism
of the moment,        that I might compare
them with this.       

And so the resolve to be silent was cast away,
and after it went the sudden resolve to tell
everything. Saxon, feeling only triumph, did
not realize that he had, in one moment, lost his
second and third battles.

An hour later, they strolled back together
toward the house. Saxon was burdened with
the canvas on which he had painted his masterpiece.
They were silent, but walking on the
milky way, their feet stirring nothing meaner
than star-dust. On the verandah, Steele met
them, and handed his friend a much-forwarded
letter, addressed in care of the Louisville club
where he had dined. It bore the stamp of a
South American Republic.

[Pg 101]
It was not until he had gone to his room that
night that the man had time to glance at it,
or even to mark its distant starting point. Then,
he tore open the envelope, and read this message:


       My Erstwhile Comrade:

       Though I       ve had no line from you in these
years I don       t flatter myself that you       ve forgotten
me. It has come to my hearing through
certain channels       subterranean, of course       that
your present name is Saxon and that you       ve
developed genius and glory as a paint-wizard.

       It seems you are now a perfectly respectable
artist! Congratulations       also bravo!

       My object is to tell you that I       ve tried to
get word to you that despite appearances it was
not I who tipped you off to the government.
That is God       s truth and I can prove it. I would
have written before, but since you beat it to
God       s Country and went West your whereabouts
have been a well-kept secret. I am innocent,
as heaven is my witness! Of course, I
am keeping mum.

       H. S. R.       






[Pg 102]

CHAPTER VII


A short time ago, Saxon had felt stronger
than all the forces of fate. He had believed
that circumstances were plastic and man invincible.
Now, as he bent forward in his
chair, the South American letter hanging in
limp fingers and the coal-oil lamp on the table
throwing its circle of light on the foreign postmark
and stamp of the envelope, he realized
that the battle was on. The forces of which
he had been contemptuous were to engage him
at once, with no breathing space before the
combat. Viewing it all in this light, he felt
the qualms of a general who encounters an
aggressive enemy before his line is drawn and
his battle front arranged.

He had so entirely persuaded himself that
his duty was clear and that he must not speak
to the girl of love that now, when he had done
so, his entire plan of campaign must be revised,
and new problems must be considered.
When he had been swept away on the tide that
carried him to an avowal, it had been with the
[Pg 103]
vague sense of realization that, if he spoke at
all, he must tell the whole story. He had not
done so, and now came a new question: Had
he the right to tell the story until, in so far as
possible, he had probed its mystery? Suppose
his worst fears proved themselves. The certainty
would be little harder to confess than
the presumption and the suspense. Suppose,
on the other hand, the fighting chance to which
every man clings should, after all, acquit him?
Would it not be needless cruelty to inflict on
her the fears that harried his own thoughts?
Must he not try first to arm himself with a
definite report for, or against, himself?

After all, he argued weakly, or perhaps it
was the devil       s advocate that whispered the
insidious counsel, there might be a mistake.
The man of Ribero       s story might still be some
one else. He had never felt the instincts of
murder. Surely, he had not been the embezzler,
the libertine, the assassin! But, in answer
to that argument, his colder logic contended
there might have been to his present
Dr. Jekyll a Mr. Hyde of the past. The letter
he held in his hand of course meant nothing
[Pg 104]
more than that Ribero had talked to some one.
It might be merely the fault of some idle gossip
in a Latin-American caf        , when the claret
flowed too freely. The writer, this unknown
       H.      S.      R.,        had probably taken Ribero       s testimony
at its face value. Then, out of the page
arose insistently the one sentence that did mean
something more, the new link in a chain of
definite conclusion.        Since you beat it to God       s
Country and went West               That was the new
evidence this anonymous witness had contributed.
He had certainly gone West!

Assuredly, he must go to South America, and
prosecute himself. To do this meant to thrust
himself into a situation that held a hundred
chances, but there was no one else who could
determine it for him. It was not merely a matter
of collecting and sifting evidence. It was
also a test of subjecting his dormant memory
to the stimulus of place and sights and sounds
and smells. When he stood at the spot where
Carter had faced his executioners, surely, if he
were Carter, he would awaken to self-recognition.
He would slip away on some pretext, and
try out the issue, and then, when he spoke to
[Pg 105]
Duska, he could speak in definite terms. And
if he were the culprit? The question came
back as surely as the pendulum swings to the
bottom of the arc, and rested at the hideous
conviction that he must be the malefactor.
Then, Saxon rose and paced the floor, his hand
convulsively crushing the letter into a crumpled
wad.

Well, he would not come back! If that were
his world, he would not re      nter it. He was
willing to try himself       to be his own prosecutor,
but, if the thing spelled a sentence of disgrace,
he reserved the right to be also his own executioner.

Then, the devil       s advocate again whispered
seductively into his perplexity.

Suppose he went and tested the environment,
searching conscience and memory       and suppose
no monitor gave him an answer. Would he
not then have the right to assume his innocence?
Would he not have the right to feel
certain that his memory, so stimulated and still
inactive, was not only sleeping, but dead?
Would he not be justified in dismissing the fear
of a future awakening, and, as Steele had
[Pg 106]
suggested, in going forward in the person of Robert
A. Saxon, abandoning the past as completely
as he had perhaps abandoned previous incarnations?

So, for the time, he stilled his fears, and under
his brush the canvases became more wonderful
than they had ever been. He had Duska
at his side, not only in the old intimacy, but in
the new and more wonderful intimacy that had
come of her acknowledged love. He would
finish the half-dozen pictures needed to complete
the consignment for the Eastern and European
exhibits, then he would start on his
journey.

A week later, Saxon took Duska to a dance at
the club-house on the top of one of the hills of
the ridge, and, after she had tired of dancing,
they had gone to a point where the brow of the
knob ran out to a jutting promontory of rock.
It was a cape in the dim sea of night mist which
hung upon, and shrouded, the flats below. Beyond
the reaches of silver gray, the more distant
hills rose in mystic shadow-shapes of deep
cobalt. There were stars overhead, but they
were pale in the whiter light of the moon, and
[Pg 107]
all the world was painted, as the moon will
paint it, in silvers and blues.

Back of them was the softened waltz-music
that drifted from the club-house and the bright
patches of color where the Chinese lanterns
swung among the trees.

As they talked, the man felt with renewed
force that the girl had given him her love in
the wonderful way of one who gives but once,
and gives all without stint or reserve. It was
as though she had presented him unconditionally
with the key to the archives of her heart,
and made him possessor of the unspent wealth
of all the Incas.

Suddenly, he realized that his plan of leaving
her without explanation, on a quest that might
permit no return, was meeting her gift with
half-confidence and deception. What he did
with himself now, he did with her property. He
was not at liberty to act without her full understanding
and sympathy in his undertakings.
The plan was one of infinite brutality.

He must tell her everything, and then go.
He struck a match for his cigar, to give himself
a moment of arranging his words, and, as
[Pg 108]
he stood shielding the light against a faintly
stirring breeze, the miniature glare fell on her
delicately chiseled lips and nose and chin. Her
expression made him hesitate. She was very
young, very innocently childlike and very happy.
To tell her now would be like spoiling a little
girls        party. It must be told soon, but not while
the dance music was still in their ears and the
waxy smell of the dance candles still in their
nostrils.

When he left her at Horton House, he did
not at once return to the cabin. He wanted
the open skies for his thoughts, and there was
no hope of sleep.

He retraced his steps from the road, and
wandered into the old-fashioned garden. At
last, he halted by the seat where he had posed
her for the portrait. The moon was sinking,
and the shadows of the garden wall and trees
and shrubs fell in long, fantastic angles across
the silvered earth. The house itself was dark
except where the panes of her window still
glowed. Standing between the tall stalks of
the hollyhocks, he held his watch up to the
moon. It was half-past two o       clock.

[Pg 109]
Then, he looked up and started with surprise
as he saw her standing in the path before him.
At first, he thought that his imagination had
projected her there. Since she had left him at
the stairs, the picture she had made in her white
gown and red roses had been vividly permanent,
though she herself had gone.

But, now, her voice was real.

       Do you prowl under my windows all night,
kind sir?        she laughed, happily.        I believe
you must be almost as much in love as I am.       

The man reached forward, and seized her
hand.

       It       s morning,        he said.        What are you doing
here?       

       I couldn       t sleep,        she assured him. Then,
she added serenely:        Do you suppose that the
moon shines like this every night, or that I can
always expect times like these? You know,       
she taunted,        it was so hard to get you to admit
that you cared that it was an achievement.
I must be appreciative, mustn       t I? You are an
altogether reserved and cautious person.       

He seized her in his arms with neither reserve
nor caution.

[Pg 110]
       Listen,        he said in an impassioned voice,
       I have no right to touch you. In five minutes,
you will probably not even let me speak
to you. I had no right to speak. I had no
right to tell you that I loved you!       

She did not draw away. She only looked
into his eyes very solemnly.

       You had no right?        she repeated, in a bewildered
voice.        Don       t you love me?       

       You don       t have to ask that,        he avowed.
       You know it. Your own heart can answer
such questions.       

       Then,        she decreed with womanlike philosophy,
       you had a right to say so       because
I love you, and that is settled.       

       No,        he expostulated,        I tell you I did
not have the right. You must forget it. You
must forget everything.        He was talking with
mad impetuosity.

       It is too late,        she said simply.        Forget!       
There was an indignant ring in her words.
       Do you think that I could forget       or that, if
I could, I would? Do you think it is a thing
that happens every day?       

From a tree at the fence line came the softly
[Pg 111]
lamenting note of a small owl, and across the
fields floated the strident shriek of a lumbering
night freight.

To Saxon       s ears, the inconsequential sounds
came with a painful distinctness. It was only
his own voice that seemed to him muffled in a
confusion of roaring noises. His lips were so
dry that he had to moisten them with his
tongue.

To hesitate, to temporize, even to soften his
recital, would mean another failure in the telling
of it. He must plunge in after his old
method of directness, even brutality, without
preface or palliation.

Here, at all events, brutality were best. If
his story appalled and repelled her, it would be
the blow that would free her from the thraldom
of the love he had unfairly stolen. If she turned
from him with loathing, at least anger would
hurt her less than heartbreak.

       Do you remember the story Ribero so
graphically told of the filibuster and assassin
and the firing squad in the plaza?        As he
spoke, Saxon knew with a nauseating sense of
certainty that his brain had never really doubted
[Pg 112]
his identity. He had futilely argued with himself,
but it was only his eagerness of wish that
had kept clamoring concerning the possibility
of a favorable solution. All the while, his reason
had convicted him. Now, as he spoke, he
felt sure, as sure as though he could really remember,
and he felt also his unworthiness to
speak to her, as though it were not Saxon, but
Carter, who held her in his arms. He suddenly
stepped back and held her away at arms        length,
as though he, Saxon, were snatching her from
the embrace of the other man, Carter. Then,
he heard her murmuring:

       Yes, of course I remember.       

       And did you notice his look of astonishment
when I came? Did you catch the covert
innuendoes as he talked       the fact that he talked
at me       that he was accusing me       my God!
recognizing me?       

The girl put up her hands, and brushed the
hair back from her forehead. She shook her
head as though to shake off some cloud of bewilderment
and awaken herself from the shock
of a nightmare. She stood so unsteadily that
the man took her arm, and led her to the bench
[Pg 113]
against the wall. There, she sank down with
her face in her hands. It seemed a century, but,
when she looked up again, her face, despite its
pallor in the moonlight, was the face of one
seeking excuses for one she loves, one trying to
make the impossible jibe with fact.

       I suppose you did not catch the full significance
of that narrative. No one did except the
two of us       the unmasker and the unmasked.
Later, he studied a scar on my hand. It       s too
dark to see, but you can feel it.       

He caught her fingers in his own. They were
icy in his hot clasp, as he pressed them against
his right palm.

       Tell me how it happened. Tell me that       that
the sequel was a lie!        She imperiously
commanded, yet there was under the imperiousness
a note of pleading.

       I can       t,        he answered.        He seemed to
know the facts. I don       t.       

Her senses were unsteady, reeling things, and
he in his evening clothes was an axis of black
and white around which the moonlit world
spun drunkenly.

Her voice was incredulous, far away.

[Pg 114]
       You don       t know?        she repeated, slowly.
       You don       t know what you did?       

Then, for the first time, he remembered that
he had not told her of the blind door between
himself and the other years. He had presented
himself only on a plea of guilty to the charge,
without even the palliation of forgetfulness.

Slowly steeling himself for the ordeal, he
went through his story. He told it as he had
told Steele, but he added to it all that he had
not told Steele       all of the certainty that was
building itself against his future out of his past.
He presented the case step by step as a prosecutor
might have done, adding bit of testimony
after bit of testimony, and ending with the sentence
from the letter, which told him that he
had gone West. He had played the coward
long enough. Now, he did not even mention
the hope he had tried to foster, that there
might be a mistake. It was all so horribly certain
that those hopes were ghosts, and he could
no longer call them from their graves. The
girl listened without a word or an interruption
of any sort.

       And so,        he said calmly at the end,        the
[Pg 115]
possibility that I vaguely feared has come forward.
The only thing that I know of my other
life is a disgraceful thing       and ruin.       

There was a long, torturing silence as she sat
steadily, almost hypnotically, gazing into his
eyes.

Then, a remarkable thing happened. The
girl came to her feet with the old lithe grace
that had for the moment forsaken her, leaving
her a shape of slender distress. She rose buoyantly
and laughed! With a quick step forward,
she threw her arms around his neck, and stood
looking into his drawn face.

He caught at her arms almost savagely.

       Don       t!        he commanded, harshly.        Don       t!       

       Why?        Her question was serene.

       Because it was Robert Saxon that you
loved. You sha       n       t touch Carter. I can       t let
Carter touch you.        He was holding her wrists
tightly, and pressing her away from him.

       I have never touched Carter,        she said, confidently.
       They lied about it, dear. You were
never Carter.       

In the white light, her upturned eyes were
sure with confidence.

[Pg 116]
       Now, you listen,        she ordered.        You told
me a case that your imagination has constructed
from foundation to top. It is an ingenious
case. Its circumstantial evidence is skilfully
woven into conviction. They have hanged men
on that sort of evidence, but here there is a
court of appeals. I know nothing about it.
I have only my woman       s heart, but my woman       s
heart knows you. There is no guilt in you       there
never has been. You have tortured yourself
because you look like a man whose name
is Carter.       

She said it all so positively, so much with the
manner of a decree from the supreme bench,
that, for a moment, the ghosts of hope began to
rise and gather in the man       s brain; for a moment,
he forgot that this was not really the final
word.

He had crucified himself in the recital to
make it easier for her to abandon him. He
had told one side only, and she had seen only
the force of what he had left unsaid. If that
could be possible, it might be possible she was
right. With the reaction came a wild momentary
[Pg 117]
joyousness. Then, his face grew grave
again.

       I had sworn by every oath I knew,        he told
her,        that I would speak no word of love to
you until I was no longer anonymous. I must
go to Puerto Frio at once, and determine it.       

Her arms tightened about his neck, and she
stood there, her hair brushing his face as though
she would hold him away from everything past
and future except her own heart.

       No! no!        she passionately dissented.
       Even if you were the man, which you are not,
you are no more responsible for that dead life
than for your acts in some other planet. You
are mine now, and I am satisfied.       

       But, if afterward,        he went on doggedly,
       if afterward I should awake into another
personality       don       t you see? Neither you nor
I, dearest, can compromise with doubtful
things. To us, life must be a thing clean beyond
the possibility of blot.       

She still shook her head in stubborn negation.

       You gave yourself to me,        she said,        and
[Pg 118]
I won       t let you go. You won       t wake up in another
life. I won       t let you       and, if you do              
she paused, then added with a smile on her lips
that seemed to settle matters for all time              that
is a bridge we will cross when we come to it       and
we will cross it together.       





[Pg 119]

CHAPTER VIII


When he reached the cabin, Saxon found
Steele still awake. The gray advance-light of
dawn beyond the eastern ridges had grown rosy,
and the rosiness had brightened into the blue of
living day when an early teamster, passing
along the turnpike, saw two men garbed in
what he would have called        full-dress suits,       
still sitting over their cigars on the verandah
of the hill shack. A losing love either expels a
man into the outer sourness of resentment, or
graduates him into a friendship that needs no
further testing. Steele was not the type that
goes into an embittered exile. His face had become
somewhat fixed as he listened, but there
had been no surprise. He had known already,
and, when the story was ended, he was an ally.

       There are two courses open to you,        he
said, when he rose at last from his seat,        the
plan you have of going to South America, and
the one I suggested of facing forward and leaving
the past behind. If you do the first, whether
[Pg 120]
or not you are the man they want, the circumstantial
case is strong. You know too little of
your past to defend yourself, and you are placing
yourself in the enemy       s hands. The result
will probably be against you with equal
certainty whether innocent or guilty.       

       Letting things lie,        demurred Saxon,
       solves nothing.       

       Why solve them?        Steele paused at his
door.        It would seem to me that with her in
your life you would be safe against forgetting
your present at all events       and that present is
enough.       

The summer was drawing to its close while
Saxon still wavered. Unless he faced the
charge that seemed impending near the equator,
he must always stand, before himself at least,
convicted. Yet, Duska was immovable in her
decision, and Steele backed her intuition with so
many plausible, masculine arguments that he
waited. He was packing and preparing the
pictures that were to be shipped to New York.
Some of them would be exhibited and sold
there. Others, to be selected by his Eastern
agent, would go on to the Paris market. He
[Pg 121]
had included the landscape painted on the cliff,
on the day when the purple flower lured him
over the edge, and the portrait of the girl.
These pictures, however, he specified, were only
for exhibition, and were not under any circumstances
to be sold.

Each day, he insisted on the necessity of his
investigation, and argued it with all the forcefulness
he could command, but Duska steadfastly
overruled him.

Once, as the sunset dyed the west with the
richness of gold and purple and orange and
lake, they were walking their horses along a
hill lane between pines and cedars. The girl       s
eyes were drinking in the color and abundant
beauty, and the man rode silent at her saddle
skirt. She had silenced his continual argument
after her usual decisive fashion. Now, she
turned her head, and demanded:

       Suppose you went and settled this, would
you be nearer your certainty? The very disproving
of this suspicion would leave you where
you were before Se        or Ribero told his story.       

       It would mean this much,        he argued.        I
should have followed to its end every clew that
[Pg 122]
was given me. I should have exhausted the
possibilities, and I could then with a clear conscience
leave the rest to destiny. I could go on
feeling that I had a right to abandon the past
because I had questioned it as far as I knew.       

She was resolute.

       I should,        he urged,        feel that in letting
you share the danger I had at least tried to
end it.       

She raised her chin almost scornfully, and
her eyes grew deeper.

       Do you think that danger can affect my
love? Are we the sort of people who have no
eyes in our hearts, and no hearts in our eyes,
who live and marry and die, and never have a
hint of loving as the gods love? I want to love
you that way       audaciously       taking every chance.
If the stars up there love, they love like that.       

Some days later, Mrs. Horton again referred
to her wish to make the trip to Venezuela. To
the man       s astonishment, Duska appeared this
time more than half in favor of it, and spoke as
though she might after all reconsider her refusal
to be her aunt       s traveling companion.
Later, when they were alone, he questioned her,
[Pg 123]
and she laughed with the note of having a profound
secret. At last, she explained.

       I am interested in South America now,        she
informed him.        I wasn       t before. I shouldn       t
think of letting you go there, but I guess I       m
safe in Puerto Frio, and I might settle your
doubts myself. You see,        she added judicially,
       I       m the one person you can trust not to betray
your secret, and yet to find out all about this
mysterious Mr. Carter.       

Saxon was frankly frightened. Unless she
promised that she would do nothing of the sort,
he would himself go at once. He had waited in
deference to her wishes, but, if the thing were to
be recognized as deserving investigation at all,
he must do it himself. He could not protect
himself behind her as his agent. She finally
assented, yet later Mrs. Horton once more referred
to the idea of the trip as though she expected
Duska to accompany her.

Then it was that Saxon was driven back on
strategy. The idea was one that he found it
hard to accept, yet he knew that he could never
gain her consent, and her suggestion proved
that, though she would not admit it, at heart
[Pg 124]
she realized the necessity of a solution. The
hanging of his canvases for exhibition afforded
an excuse for going to New York. On his arrival
there, he would write to her, explaining his
determination to take a steamer for the south,
and        put it to the touch, to win or lose it all.       
There seemed to be no alternative.

He did not take Steele into his confidence,
because Steele agreed with Duska, and should
be able to say, when questioned, that he had not
been a party to the conspiracy. When Saxon
stood, a few days later, on the step of an inbound
train, the girl stood waving her sunbonnet,
slenderly outlined against the green background
of the woods beyond the flag-station.
A sudden look of pain crossed the man       s face,
and he leaned far out for a last glimpse of her
form.

Steele saw Duska       s smile grow wistful as the
last car rounded the curve.

       I can       t quite accustom myself to it,        he said,
slowly:        this new girl who has taken the place
of the other, of the girl who did not know how
to love.       

       I know more about it,        she declared,        than
[Pg 125]
anybody else that ever lived. And I       ve only
one life to give to it.       

Saxon       s first mistake was born of the precipitate
haste of love. He wrote the letter to
Duska that same evening on the train. It was
a difficult letter to write. He had to explain,
and explain convincingly, that he was disobeying
her expressed command only because his
love was not the sort that could lull itself into
false security. If fate held any chance for him,
he would bring back victory. If he laid the
ghost of Carter, he would question his sphinx
no further.

The writing was premature, because he had
to stop in Washington and seek Ribero. He
had some questions to ask. But, at Washington,
he learned that Ribero had been recalled by
government. Then, hurrying through his business
in New York, Saxon took the first steamer
sailing. It happened to be by a slow line, necessitating
several transfers.

It was characteristic of Duska that, when she
received the letter hardly a day after Saxon       s
departure, she did not at once open it, but, slipping
it, dispatch-like, into her belt, she called
[Pg 126]
the terrier, and together they went into the
woods. Here, sitting among the ferns with
the blackberry thicket at her back and the creek
laughing below, she read and reread the pages.

For a while, she sat stunned, her brow drawn;
then, she said to the terrier in a voice as nearly
plaintive as she ever allowed it to be:

       I don       t like it. I don       t want him ever to
go away       and yet               she tossed her head upward              yet,
I guess I shouldn       t have much use
for him if he didn       t do just such things.       

The terrier evidently approved the sentiment,
for he cocked his head gravely to the side, and
slowly wagged his stumpy tail.

But the girl did not remain long in idleness.
For a time, her forehead was delicately corrugated
under the stress of rapid thinking as she
sat, her fingers clasped about her updrawn
knees, then she rose and hurried to Horton
House. There were things to be done and
done at once, and it was her fashion, once reaching
resolution, to act quickly.

It was necessary to take Mrs. Horton into
her full confidence, because it was necessary that
Mrs. Horton should be ready to go with her,
[Pg 127]
as fast as trains and steamers could carry them,
to a town called Puerto Frio in South America,
and South America was quite a long way off.
Mrs. Horton had known for weeks that something
more was transpiring than showed on the
surface. She had even inferred that there was
       an understanding        between her niece and the
painter, and this inference she had not found
displeasing. The story that Duska told did
astonish her, but under her composure of manner
Mrs. Horton had the ability to act with
prompt decision. Mr. Horton knew only part,
but was complacent, and saw no reason why a
trip planned for a later date should not be        advanced
on the docket,        and it was so ordered.

Steele, of course, already knew most of the
story, and it was he who kept the telephone busy
between the house and the city ticket-offices.
While the ladies packed, he was acquiring vast
information as to schedules and connections.
He learned that they could catch an outgoing
steamer from New Orleans, which would probably
put them at their destination only a day or
two behind Saxon. Incidentally, in making
these arrangements, Steele reserved accommodations
[Pg 128]
for himself as well as Mrs. Horton and
her niece.


With the American coast left behind, Saxon       s
journey through the Caribbean, even with the
palliation of the trade-winds, was insufferably
hot. The slenderly filled passenger-list gave
the slight alleviation of an uncrowded ship.
Those few travelers whose misfortunes doomed
them to such a cruise at such a time, lay listlessly
under the awnings, and watched the face
of the water grow bluer, bluer, bluer to the hot
indigo of the twentieth parallel, where nothing
seemed cool enough for energy or motion except
the flying fish and the pursuing gull.

There were several days of this to be endured,
and the painter, thinking of matters further
north and further south, found no delight
in its beauty. He would stand, deep in thought,
at the bow when day died and night was
born without benefit of twilight, watching the
disk of the sun plunge into the sea like a diver.
It seemed that Nature herself was here sudden
and passionate in matters of life and death. He
saw the stars come out, low-hanging and large,
[Pg 129]
and the water blaze with phosphorescence wherever
a wave broke, brilliantly luminous where
the propeller churned the wake. It was to him
an ominous beauty, fraught with crowding portents
of ill omen.

The entering and leaving of ports became
monotonous. Each was a steaming village of
hot adobe walls, corrugated-iron custom houses
and sweltering, ragged palms. At last, at a
town no more or less appealing than the others,
just as the ear-splitting whistle screeched its last
warning of departure, a belated passenger came
over the side from a frantically-driven row-boat.
The painter was looking listlessly out at
the green coast line, and did not notice the new
arrival.

The newcomer followed his luggage up the
gangway to the deck, his forehead streaming
perspiration, his none-too-fresh gray flannels
splashed with salt water. At the top, he shook
the hand of the second officer, with the manner
of an old acquaintance.

       I guess that was close!        he announced, as
he mopped his face with a large handkerchief,
and began fanning himself with a stained Panama
[Pg 130]
hat.        Did the       the stuff get aboard all
right at New York?       

The officer looked up, with a quick, cautious
glance about him.

       The machinery is stowed away in the hold,       
he announced.

       Good,        replied the newcomer, energetically.
       That machinery must be safeguarded. It is
required in the development of a country that
needs developin       . Do I draw my usual stateroom?
See the purser? Good!       

The tardy passenger was tall, a bit under six
feet, but thin almost to emaciation. His face
was keen, and might have been handsome except
that the alertness was suggestive of the fox or
the weasel       furtive rather than intelligent. The
eyes were quick-seeing and roving; the nose,
aquiline; the lips, thin. On them sat habitually
a half-satirical smile. The man had black hair
sprinkled with gray, yet he could not have been
more than thirty-six or seven.

       I       ll just run in and see the purser,        he announced,
with his tireless energy. Saxon, turning
from the hatch, caught only a vanishing
glimpse of a tall, flannel-clad figure disappearing
[Pg 131]
into the doorway of the main saloon, as he
himself went to his stateroom to freshen himself
up for dinner.

As the painter emerged from his cabin a few
minutes before the call of the dinner-bugle, the
thin man was lounging against the rail further
aft.

Saxon stood for a moment drinking in the
grateful coolness that was creeping into the air
with the freshening of the evening breeze.

The stranger saw him, and started. Then, he
looked again, with the swift comprehensiveness
that belonged to his keen eyes, and stepped
modestly back into the protecting angle where
he could himself be sheltered from view by the
bulk of a tarpaulined life-boat. When Saxon
turned and strolled aft, the man closely followed
these movements, then went into his own cabin.

That evening, at dinner, the new passenger
did not appear. He dined in his stateroom,
but later, as Saxon lounged with his own
thoughts on the deck, the tall American was
never far away, though he kept always in the
blackest shadow thrown by boats or superstructure
on the moonlit deck. If Saxon turned
[Pg 132]
suddenly, the other would flatten himself furtively
and in evident alarm back into the blackness.
He had the manner of a man who is
hunted, and who has recognized a pursuer.

Saxon, ignorant even of the other       s presence,
had no knowledge of the interest he was himself
exciting. Had his curiosity been aroused
to inquiry, he might have learned that the man
who had recently come aboard was one Howard
Stanley Rodman. It is highly improbable,
however, that he would have discovered the
additional fact that the        stuff        Rodman had
asked after as he came aboard was not the
agricultural implements described in its billing,
but revolutionary muskets to be smuggled off at
sunrise to-morrow to the coast village La
Punta, five miles above Puerto Frio.

Not knowing that a conspirator was hiding
away in a cabin through fear of him, Saxon
was of course equally unconscious of having as
shipmate a man as dangerous as the cornered
wolf to one who stands between itself and
freedom.

La Punta is hardly a port. The shipping
for this section of the east coast goes to Puerto
[Pg 133]
Frio, and Saxon had not come out of his cabin
the next morning when Rodman left. The
creaking of crane chains disturbed his sleep,
but he detected nothing prophetic in the sound.
To have done so, he must have understood that
the customs officer at this ocean flag station was
up to his neck in a revolutionary plot which
was soon to burst; that the steamship line,
because of interests of its own which a change
of government would advance, had agreed to
regard the rifles in the hold as agricultural implements,
and that Mr. Rodman was among
the most expert of traveling salesmen for revolutions
and organizers of juntas. To all that
knowledge, he must then have added the quality
of prophecy. It is certain, however, that, had
he noted the other       s interest in himself and
coupled with that interest the coincidence that
the initials of the furtive gentleman       s name on
the purser       s list were        H.      S.      R.,        he would
have slept still more brokenly.

If he had not looked Mr. Rodman up on the
list, Mr. Rodman had not been equally delinquent.
The name Robert A. Saxon had by no
means escaped his attention.





[Pg 134]

CHAPTER IX


Puerto Frio sits back of its harbor, a medley
of corrugated iron roofs, adobe walls and
square-towered churches. Along the water
front is a fringe of ragged palms. At one end
of the semicircle that breaks the straight coast
line, a few steamers come to anchorage; at
the other rise jugged groups of water-eaten
rocks, where the surf runs with a cannonading
of breakers, and tosses back a perpetual lather
of infuriated spray. From the mole, Saxon had
his first near view of the city. He drew a
long inhalation of the hot air, and looked anxiously
about him.

He had been asking himself during the
length of his journey whether a reminder would
be borne in on his senses, and awaken them to a
throb of familiarity. He had climbed the slippery
landing stairs with the oppressing consciousness
that he might step at their top into a
new world       or an old and forgotten world.
[Pg 135]
Now, he drew to one side, and swept his eyes
questioningly about.

Before him stretched a broad open space,
through which the dust swirled hot and indolent.
Beyond lay the Plaza of Santo Domingo,
and on the twin towers of its church two crosses
leaned dismally askew. A few barefooted natives
slouched across the sun-refracting square,
their shadows blue against the yellow heat.
Saxon       s gaze swung steadily about the radius of
sight, but his brain, like a paralyzed nerve,
touched with the testing-electrode, gave no reflex       no
response.

There was a leap at his heart which became
hope as his cab jolted on to the Hotel Frances
y Ingles over streets that awoke no convicting
memories. He set out almost cheerfully for
the American Legation to present the letters of
introduction he had brought from New York
and to tell his story. Thus supplied with credentials
and facts, the official might be prepared
to assist him.

His second step       the test upon which he
mainly depended       involved a search for a
yellow cathedral wall, surrounded with red
[Pg 136]
flowers and facing an open area. There, Saxon
wanted to stand, for a moment, against the
masonry, with the sounds of the street in his
ears and the rank fragrance of the vine in his
nostrils. There he would ask his memory, under
the influence of these reminders, the question
the water-front had failed to answer.

That wandering, however, should be reserved
for the less conspicuous time of night.
He would spend the greater part of the day,
since his status was so dubious, in the protection
of his room at the hotel.

If night did not answer the question, he would
go again at sunrise, and await the early glare
on the wall, since that would exactly duplicate
former conditions. The night influences would
be softer, less cruel       and less exact, but he
would go first by darkness and reconnoiter the
ground       unless his riddle were solved before.

The American Legation, he was informed,
stood as did his hostelry, on the main Plaza,
only a few doors distant and directly opposite
the palace of the President.

He was met by Mr. Partridge, the secretary
of legation. The minister was spending
[Pg 137]
several days at Miravista, but was expected back
that evening, or to-morrow morning at the
latest. In the meantime, if the secretary could
be of service to a countryman, he would be glad.
The secretary was a likable young fellow with
frank American eyes. He fancied Saxon       s face,
and was accordingly cordial.

       There is quite a decent club here for Anglo-Saxon
exiles,        announced Mr. Partridge.
       Possibly, you       d like to look in? I       m occupied
for the day, but I       ll drop around for you this
evening, and make you out a card.       

Saxon left his letters with the secretary to
be given to the chief on arrival, and returned
to the        Frances y Ingles.       

He did not again emerge from his room until
evening, and, as he left the patio of the hotel
for his journey to the old cathedral, the moon
was shining brightly between the shadows of
the adobe walls and the balconies that hung
above the pavements. As he went out through
the street-door, Mr. Howard Stanley Rodman
glanced furtively up from a corner table, and
tossed away a half-smoked cigarette.

The old cathedral takes up a square. In the
[Pg 138]
niches of its outer wall stand the stone effigies
of many saints. Before its triple, iron-studded
doors stretches a tiled terrace. At its right
runs a side-street, and, attracted by a patch of
clambering vine on the time-stained walls,
where the moon fell full upon them, Saxon
turned into the byway. At the far end, the
fa        ade rose blankly, fronting a bare drill-ground,
and there he halted. The painter had
not counted on the moon. Now, as he took his
place against the wall, it bathed him in an
almost effulgent whiteness. The shadows of
the abutments were inky in contrast, and the
disused and ancient cannon, planted at the curb
for a corner post, stood out boldly in relief.
But the street was silent and, except for himself,
absolutely deserted.

For a time, he stood looking outward. From
somewhere at his back, in the vaultlike recesses
of the building, drifted the heavy pungency of
incense burning at a shrine.

His ears were alert for the sounds that
might, in their drifting inconsequence, mean
everything. Then, as no reminder came, he
closed his eyes, and wracked his imagination in
[Pg 139]
concentrated thought as a monitor to memory.
He groped after some detail of the other time,
if the other time had been an actual fragment
of his life. He strove to recall the features of
the officer who commanded the death squad,
some face that had stood there before him on
that morning; the style of uniforms they wore.
He kept his eyes closed, not only for seconds,
but for minutes, and, when in answer to his focused
self-hypnotism and prodding suggestion
no answer came, there came in its stead a torrent
of joyous relief.

Then, he heard something like a subdued
ejaculation, and opened his eyes upon a startling
spectacle.

Leaning out from the shadow of an abutment
stood a thin man, whose face in the moon
showed a strange mingling of savagery and
terror. It was a face Saxon did not remember
to have seen before. The eyes glittered, and
the teeth showed as the thin lips were drawn
back over them in a snarling sort of smile.
But the most startling phase of the tableau, to
the man who opened his eyes upon it without
warning, was the circumstance of the unknown       s
[Pg 140]
pressing an automatic pistol against his breast.
Saxon       s first impression was that he had
fallen prey to a robber, but he knew instinctively
that this expression was not that of a
man bent on mere thievery. It had more depth
and evil satisfaction. It was the look of a
man who turns a trick in an important game.

As the painter gazed at the face and figure
bending forward from the abutment       s sooty
shadow like some chimera or gargoyle fashioned
in the wall, his first sentiment was less
one of immediate peril than of argument with
himself. Surely, so startling a d        nouement
should serve to revive his memory, if he had
faced other muzzles there!

When the man with the pistol spoke, it was
in words that were illuminating. The voice
was tremulous with emotion, probably nervous
terror, yet the tone was intended to convey
irony, and was partly successful.

       I presume,        it said icily,        you wished to
enjoy the sensation of standing at that point       this
time with the certainty of walking away
alive. It must be a pleasant reminiscence, but
one never can tell.        The thin man paused, and
[Pg 141]
then began afresh, his voice charged with a
bravado that somehow seemed to lack genuineness.

       Last time, you expected to be carried away
dead       and went away living. This time, you
expected to walk away in safety, and, instead,
you       ve got to die. Your execution was only
delayed.        He gave a short, nervous laugh,
then his voice came near breaking as he went
on almost wildly:        I       ve got to kill you, Carter.
God knows I don       t want to do it, but I
must have security! This knowledge that you
are watching me to drop on me like a hawk on
a rat, will drive me mad. They       ve told me up
and down both these God-forsaken coasts, from
Ancon to Buenos Ayres, from La Boca to Concepcion,
that you would get me, and now it       s
sheer self-defense with me. I know you never
forgave a wrong       and God knows that I never
did you the wrong you are trying to revenge.
God knows I am innocent.       

Rodman halted breathless, and stood with
his flat chest rising and falling almost hysterically.
He was in the state when men are most
irresponsible and dangerous.

[Pg 142]
Meanwhile, a pistol held in an unsteady
hand, its trigger under an uncertain finger,
emphasized a situation that called for electrical
thinking. To assert a mistake in identity
would be ludicrous. Saxon was not in a position
to claim that. The other man seemed to
have knowledge that he himself lacked. Moreover,
that knowledge was the information
which Saxon, as self-prosecutor, must have.
The only course was to meet the other       s bravado
with a counter show of bravado, and keep
him talking. Perhaps, some one would pass in
the empty street.

       Well,        demanded Rodman between gasping
breaths,        why in hell don       t you say something?       

Saxon began to feel the mastery of the
stronger man over the weaker, despite the fact
that the weaker supplemented his inferiority
with a weapon.

       It appears to me,        came the answer, and it
was the first time Rodman had heard the voice,
now almost velvety,        it appears to me that
there isn       t very much for me to say. You seem
to be in the best position to do the talking.       

[Pg 143]
       Yes, damn you!        accused the other, excitedly.
       You are always the same       always
making the big pyrotechnic display! You
have grandstanded and posed as the debonair
adventurer, until it       s come to be second
nature. That won       t help now!        The thin
man       s braggadocio changed suddenly to something
like a whine.

       You know I       m frightened, and you       re
throwing a bluff. You       re a fool not to realize
that it       s because I       m so frightened that I am
capable of killing you. I       ve craned my neck
around every corner, and jumped at every
shadow since that day       always watching for
you. Now, I       m going to end it. I see your
plan as if it were printed on a glass pane.
You       ve discovered my doings, and, if you left
here alive, you       d inform the government.       

Here, at least, Saxon could speak, and speak
truthfully.

       I don       t know anything, or care anything,
about your plans,        he retorted, curtly.

       That       s a damned lie!        almost shrieked
the other man.        It       s just your style. It       s
just your infernal chicanery. I wrote you that
[Pg 144]
letter in good faith, and you tracked me. You
found out where I was and what I was doing.
How you learned it, God knows, but I suppose
it       s still easy for you to get into the confidence
of the juntas. The moment I saw you on the
boat, the whole thing flashed on me. It was
your fine Italian brand of work to come down
on the very steamer that carried my guns       to
come ashore just at the psychological moment,
and turn me over to the authorities on the exact
verge of my success! Your brand of humor
saw irony in that       in giving me the same sort
of death you escaped. But it       s too late.
Vegas has the guns in spite of you! There       ll
be a new president in the palace within three
days.        The man       s voice became almost triumphant.
He was breathing more normally
once again, as his courage gained its second
wind.

Saxon was fencing for time. Incidentally, he
was learning profusely about the revolution of
to-morrow, but nothing of the revolution of
yesterday.

       I neither know, nor want to know, anything
about your dirty work,        he said, shortly.
[Pg 145]
       Moreover, if you think I       m bent on vengeance,
you are a damned fool to tell me.       

Rodman laughed satirically.

       Oh, I       m not so easy as you give me credit
for being. You are trying to        kiss your way
out,        as the thieves put it. You       re trying to
talk me out of killing you, but do you know
why I       m willing to tell you all this?        He
halted, then went on tempestuously.        I       ll tell
you why. In the first place, you know it already,
and, in the second place, you       ll never
repeat any information after to-night. It       s
idiotic perhaps, but my reason for not killing
you right at the start is that I       ve got a fancy
for telling you the true facts, whether you
choose to believe them or not. It will ease my
conscience afterward.       

Saxon stood waiting for the next move, bracing
himself for an opportunity that might
present itself, the pistol muzzle still pointed at
his chest.

       I       m not timid,        went on the other.        You
know me. Howard Rodman, speakin        in
general, takes his chances. But I am afraid
of you, more afraid than I am of the devil in
[Pg 146]
hell. I know I can       t bluff you. I saw you
stand against this wall with the soldiers out
there in front, and, since you can       t be frightened
off, you must be killed.        The man       s voice
gathered vehemence as he talked, and his face
showed growing agitation.        And the horrible
part is that it       s all a mistake, that I       d rather be
friends with you, if you       d let me. I never was
informant against you.       

He paused, exhausted by his panic and his
flow of words. Saxon, with a strong effort, collected
his staggered senses.

       Why do you think I come for vengeance?       
he asked.

       Why do I think it?        The thin man
laughed bitterly.        Why, indeed? What except
necessity or implacable vengeance could
drive a man to this God-forsaken strip of
coast? And you       you with money enough to
live richly in God       s country, you whose very
face in these boundaries invites imprisonment
or death! What else could bring you? But I
knew you       d come       and, so help me God, I       m
innocent.       

A sudden idea struck Saxon. This might be
[Pg 147]
the cue to draw on the frightened talker without
self-revelation.

       What do you want me to believe were the
real facts?        he demanded, with an assumption
of the cold incredulity that seemed expected of
him.

The other spoke eagerly.

       That morning when General Ojedas       
forces entered Puerto Frio, and the government
seized me, you were free. Then, I was
released, and you arrested. You drew your
conclusions. Oh, they were natural enough.
But, before heaven, they were wrong!       

Saxon felt that, until he had learned the full
story, he must remain the actor. Accordingly,
he allowed himself a skeptical laugh. Rodman,
stung by the implied disbelief, took up his
argument again:

       You think I       m lying. It sounds too fishy!
Of course, it was my enterprise. It was a revolution
of my making. You were called in as
the small lawyer calls in the great one. I concede
all that. For me to have sacrificed you
would have been infamous, but I didn       t do it.
I had been little seen in Puerto Frio. I was
[Pg 148]
not well known. I had arranged it all from
the outside while you had been in the city.
You were less responsible, but more suspected.
You remember how carefully we planned       how
we kept apart. You know that even you and
I met only twice, and that I never even saw
your man, Williams.       

Through the bitterness of conviction, a part
of Saxon       s brain seemed to be looking on impersonally
and marveling, almost with amusement,
at the remarkable position in which he
found himself. Here stood a man before him
with a pistol pressed close to his chest, threatening
execution, denouncing, cursing, yet all
the while giving evidence of terror, almost
pleading with his victim to believe his story!
It was the armed man who was frightened,
who dreaded the act he declared he was about
to commit. And, as Saxon stood listening, it
dawned upon him, in the despair of the moment,
that it was a matter of small concern to
himself whether or not the other fired. The
story he had heard had already done the injury.
The bullet would be less cruel.... Rodman
went on:

[Pg 149]
       I bent every effort to saving you, but Williams
had confessed. He was frightened. It
was his first experience. He didn       t know of
my connection with the thing. So help me
God, that is the true version.       

The story sickened Saxon, coming to him as it
did in a form he could no longer disbelieve.
He raised his hands despairingly. At last, he
heard the other       s voice again.

       When the scrap ended, and you were in
power, I had gone. I was afraid to come
back. I knew what you would think, and then,
after you left the country, I couldn       t find where
you had gone.       

       You may believe me or not,        the painter
said apathetically,        but I have forgotten all
that. I have no resentment, no wish for
vengeance. I had not even suspected you. I
give you my word on that.       

       Of course,        retorted Rodman excitedly,
       you       d say that. You       re looking down a gun-barrel.
You       re talking for your life. Of
course, you       d lie.       

Then, the revolutionist did a foolish and unguarded
thing. He came a step nearer, and
[Pg 150]
pressed the muzzle closer against Saxon       s chest,
his own eyes glaring into those of his captive.
The movement threw Saxon       s hands out of his
diminished field of sight. In an instant, the
painter had caught the wrist of the slighter man
in a grip that paralyzed the hand, and forced it
aside. The pistol fell from the nerveless fingers,
and dropped clattering to the flagstones.
As it struck, Saxon swept it backward with his
foot.

Rodman leaped frantically backward, and
stood for a moment rearranging his crumpled
cuff with the dazed manner of a man who hopes
for no quarter. His lower jaw dropped, and
he remained trembling, almost idiotic of mien.
Then, as Saxon picked up the weapon and stood
fingering its trigger, the filibuster drew himself
up really with dignity. He stretched out both
empty hands, and shrugged his shoulders.

The fear of an enemy silently stalking him
had filled his days with terror. Now that he
regarded death as certain, his cowardice
dropped away like a discarded cloak.

       I don       t ask much,        he said simply;        only,
for God       s sake kill me here! Don       t surrender
[Pg 151]
me to the government! At least, let the other
fellows know that I was dead before their plans
were betrayed.       

       I told you,        said Saxon in a dull voice,
       that I had no designs on you. I meant it!
I told you I had forgotten. I meant it!       

As he spoke, Saxon       s head dropped forward
on his chest, and he stood breathing heavily.
The moonlight, falling full on his face, showed
such heart-broken misery as might have belonged
to the visage of some unresting ghost
in an Inferno. His eyes were the eyes of utter
despair, and the hand that held the pistol hung
limp at his side, the weapon lying loose in its
palm. Rodman stood wide-eyed before him.
Had he already been killed and returned to
life, he could hardly have been more astonished,
and, when Saxon at last raised his face
and spoke again, the astonishment was greater
than ever.

       Take your gun,        said the painter, raising
his hand slowly, and presenting the weapon
stock first.        If you want to kill me       go ahead.       

Rodman, for an instant, suspected some subterfuge;
then, looking into the eyes before him,
[Pg 152]
he realized that they were too surcharged with
sadness to harbor either vengeance or treachery.
He could not fathom the meaning, but he
realized that from this man he had nothing
to fear. He slowly reached out his hand, and,
when he had taken the pistol, he put it away in
his pocket.

Saxon laughed bitterly.

       So, that       s the answer!        he muttered.

Without a word, the painter turned, and
walked toward the front of the cathedral;
without a word, Rodman fell in by his side, and
walked with him. When they had gone a
square, Saxon was again himself except for a
stonily set face. Rodman was wondering how
to apologize. Carter had never been a liar.
If Carter said he had no thought of vengeance,
it was true, and Rodman had insulted him
with the surmise.

Finally, the thin man inquired in a different
and much softer voice:

       What are you doing in Puerto Frio?       

       It has nothing to do with revenge or punishment,       
replied Saxon,        and I don       t want
to hear intrigues.       

[Pg 153]
A quarter of an hour later, they reached the
main plaza, Rodman still mystified and Saxon
walking on aimlessly at his side. He had no
definite destination. Nothing mattered. After
a long silence, Rodman demanded:

       Aren       t you taking a chance       risking it in
Puerto Frio?       

       I don       t know.       

There was another pause, broken at last by
Rodman:

       Take this from me. Get at once in touch
with the American legation, and keep in touch!
Stand on your good behavior. You may get
away with it.        He interrupted himself abruptly
with the question:        Have you been keeping
posted on South American affairs of late?       

       I don       t know who is President,        replied
Saxon.

       Well, I       ll tip you off. The only men who
held any direct proof about       about the $200,000
in gold that left about the same time you
did              Saxon winced              went into oblivion with
the last revolution. Time is a great restorer,
and so many similar affairs have intervened
that you are probably forgotten. But, if I were
[Pg 154]
you, I would get through my affairs early and       beat
it. It       s a wise boy that is not where he
is, when he       s wanted by some one he doesn       t
want.       

Saxon made no reply.

       Say,        commented the irrepressible revolutionist,
as they strolled into the arcade at the
side of the main plaza,        you       ve changed a bit
in appearance. You       re a bit heavier, aren       t
you?       

Saxon did not seem to hear.

The plaza was gay with the life of the miniature
capital. Officers strolled about in their
brightest uniforms, blowing cigarette smoke
and ogling the se        oritas, who looked shyly back
from under their mantillas.

From the band-stand blared the national air.
Natives and foreigners sauntered idly, taking
their pleasure with languid ease. But Rodman
kept to the less conspicuous sides and the shadows
of the arcade, and Saxon walked with him,
unseeing and deeply miserable.

Between the electric glare of the plaza and
the first arc-light of the Calle Bolivar is a corner
comparatively dark. Here, the men met
two army officers in conversation. Near them
[Pg 155]
waited a handful of soldiers. As the Americans
came abreast, an officer fell in on either
side of them.

       Pardon, se        ors,        said one, speaking in
Spanish with extreme politeness,        but it is necessary
that we ask you to accompany us to the
Palace.       

The soldiers had fallen in behind, following.
Now, they separated, and some of them came
to the front, so that the two men found themselves
walking in a hollow square. Rodman
halted.

       What does this signify?        he demanded in
a voice of truculent indignation.        We are
citizens of the United States!       

       I exceedingly deplore the inconvenience,       
declared the officer.        At the Palace, I have
no doubt, it will be explained.       

       I demand that we be taken first to the
United States Legation,        insisted Rodman.

The officer regretfully shook his head.
       Doubtless, se        ors,        he assured them,        your
legation will be immediately communicated
with. I have no authority to deviate from my
orders.       





[Pg 156]

CHAPTER X


At the Palace, the Americans were separated.
Saxon was ushered into a small room,
barely furnished. Its one window was barred,
and the one door that penetrated its thick
wall was locked from the outside. It seemed
incredible that under such stimulus his memory
should remain torpid. This must be an absolute
echo from the past       yet, he could not remember.
But Rodman remembered       and evidently
the government remembered.

About the same hour, Mr. Partridge called
at the        Frances y Ingles,        where he learned
that Se        or Saxon had gone out. He called
again late in the evening. Saxon had not returned.

The following morning, the Hon. Charles
Pendleton, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary of the United States of America,
read Saxon       s letters of introduction. The
letters sufficiently established the standing of
the artist to assure him his minister       s interest.
[Pg 157]
Partridge was dispatched to the hotel to bring
the traveler to the legation. Partridge came
back within the hour, greatly perturbed. Having
found that Saxon had not returned during
the night, and knowing the customs of the country,
he had spent a half-hour in investigating
by channels known to himself. He learned, at
the end of much questioning and cross-questioning,
that the se        or, together with another gentleman
evidently also an Americano del Nordo,
had passed the street-door late in the evening,
with military escort.

Mr. Partridge hastened to his legation at a
rate of speed subversive of all Puerto Frio traditions.
In Puerto Frio, haste is held to be an
affront to dignity, and dignity is esteemed.

The Hon. Charles Pendleton listened to his
subordinate       s report with rising choler.

His diplomacy was of the aggressive type,
and his first duty was that of making the protecting
pinions of the spread eagle stretch wide
enough to reach every one of those entitled to
its guardianship.

Saxon and Rodman had the night before
entered the frowning walls of the Palace
[Pg 158]
through a narrow door at the side. The American
minister now passed hastily between files
of presented arms. Inside, he learned that his
excellency, el Presidente, had not yet finished
his breakfast, but earnestly desired his excellency,
el ministro, to share with him an alligator
pear and cup of coffee.

In the suave presence of the dictator, the minister       s
choler did not cease. Rather, it smoldered
while he listened perfunctorily to flattering
banalities. He had struck through intermediary
stages; had passed over the heads of
departments and holders of portfolios, to issue
his ultimatum to the chief executive. Yet, in
approaching his subject, he matched the other       s
suavity with a pleasantness that the dictator
distrusted. The dark face of the autocrat became
grave until, when Mr. Pendleton reached
the issue, it was deeply sympathetic, surprised
and attentive.

       I am informed that some one       I can not
yet say who       wearing your excellency       s uniform,
seized an American citizen of prominence
on the streets of Puerto Frio last evening.       

The President was shocked and incredulous.

[Pg 159]
       Impossible!        he exclaimed with deep distress;
then, again:        Impossible!       

From the diplomat       s eloquent sketching of
the situation, it might have been gathered that
the United States war department stood anxiously
watching for such affronts, and that the
United States war department would be very
petulant when notification of the incident
reached it. Mr. Pendleton further assured
his excellency, el Presidente, that it would be
his immediate care to see that such notification
had the right of way over the Panama cable.

       I have information,        began the dictator
slowly,        that two men suspected of connection
with an insurgent junta have been arrested. As
to their nationality, I have received no details.
Certainly, no American citizen has been seized
with my consent. The affair appears grave, and
shall be investigated. Your excellency realizes
the necessity of vigilance. The revolutionist
forfeits his nationality.        He spread
his hands in a vague gesture.

       Mr. Robert Saxon,        retorted the minister,
       should hardly be a suspect. The fact that he
was not a guest at my legation, and for the
[Pg 160]
time a member of my family, was due only to
the accident of my absence from the city on his
arrival yesterday.       

With sudden bustle, the machinery of the Palace
was set in motion. Of a surety, some one
had blundered, and        some one        should be condignly
punished!

It was a very irate gentleman, flushed from
unwonted exertion in the tropics, who was ushered
at last into Saxon       s room. It was a very
much puzzled and interested gentleman who
stood contemplatively studying the direct eyes
of the prisoner a half-hour later.

Saxon had told Mr. Pendleton the entire narrative
of his quest of himself, and, as he told it,
the older man listened without a question or
interruption, standing with his eyes fixed on the
teller, twisting an unlighted cigar in his fingers.

       Mr. Saxon, I am here to safeguard the interests
of Americans. Our government does
not, however, undertake to chaperon filibustering
expeditions. It becomes necessary to question
you.       

There followed a brief catechism in which
the replies seemed to satisfy the questioner.
[Pg 161]
When he came to the incident of his meeting
with Rodman, Saxon paused.

       As to Rodman,        he said,        who was arrested
with me, I have no knowledge that
would be evidence. I know nothing except
from the hearsay of his recital.       

Mr. Pendleton raised his hand.

       I am only questioning you as to yourself.
This other man, Rodman, will have to prove
his innocence. I       m afraid I can       t help him.
According to their own admissions, they know
nothing against you beyond the fact that you
were seen with him last night.       

Saxon came to his feet, bewildered.

       But the previous matter       the embezzlement?       
he demanded.        Of course, I had
nothing to do with this affair. It was that
other for which I was arrested.       

The envoy laughed.

       You punched cows six years ago. You cartooned
five years ago, and you have painted
landscapes ever since. I presume, if it became
necessary, you could prove an alibi for almost
seven years?       

Saxon nodded. He fancied he saw the drift
[Pg 162]
of the argument. It was to culminate in the
same counsel that Steele had given. He would
be advised to allow the time to reach the
period when his other self should be legally
dead.

Mr. Pendleton paced the floor for a space,
then came back and halted before the cot, on
the edge of which the prisoner sat.

       I have been at this post only two years, but
I am, of course, familiar with the facts of that
case.        He paused, then added with irrelevance:
       It may be that you bear a somewhat striking
resemblance to this particularly disreputable
conspirator. Of course, that       s possible, but              

       But highly improbable,        admitted Saxon.

       Oh, you are not that man! That can be
mathematically demonstrated,        asserted Mr.
Pendleton suddenly.        I was only reflecting on
the fallibility of circumstantial evidence. I am
a lawyer, and once, as district attorney, I convicted
a man on such evidence. He       s in the
penitentiary now, and it set me wondering
if              

But Saxon stood dumfounded, vainly trying
to speak. His face was white, and he had
[Pg 163]
seized the envoy by the arm with a grip too
emphatic for diplomatic etiquette.

       Do you know what you are saying?        he
shouted.        I am not that man! How do you
know that?       

       I know it,        responded Mr. Pendleton
calmly,        because the incident of the firing-squad
occurred five years ago       and the embezzlement
only four years back.       

Saxon remained staring in wide-eyed amazement.
He felt his knees grow suddenly weak,
and the blood cascaded through the arteries of
his temples. Then, he turned, and, dropping
again to the edge of the cot, covered his face
with his hands.

       You see,        explained Mr. Pendleton,        there
is only one ground upon which any charge
against you can be reinstated       an impeachment
of your evidence as to how you have put in
the past five years. And,        he smilingly summarized,
       since the case comes before this
court solely on your self-accusation, since you
have journeyed some thousands of miles merely
to prosecute yourself, I regard your evidence
on that point as conclusive.       

[Pg 164]
Later, the envoy, with his arm through that
of the liberated prisoner, walked out past deferential
sentries into the Plaza.

       And, now, the blockade being run,        he amiably
inquired,        what are your plans?       

       Plans!        exclaimed Saxon scornfully;        plans,
sir, is plural. I have only one: to catch the
next boat that       s headed north. Why,        he explained,
       there is soon going to be an autumn
in the Kentucky hills with all the woods
a blaze of color.       

The minister       s eyes took on a touch of nostalgia.

       I guess there       s nothing much the matter
with the autumn in Indiana, either,        he affirmed.

They walked on together at a slow gait, for
the morning sun was already beginning to beat
down as if it were focused through a burning-glass.

       And say,        suggested Mr. Pendleton at last,
       if you ever get to a certain town in Indiana
called Vevay, which is on some of the more
complete maps, walk around for me and look
at the Davis building. You won       t see much       only
[Pg 165]
a hideous two-story brick, with a metal
roof and dusty windows, but my shingle used
to hang out there       and it       s in God       s country!       

Before they had reached the legation, Saxon
remembered that his plans involved another
detail, and with some secrecy he sought the
cable office, and wrote a message to Duska. Its
composition consumed a half-hour, yet he felt
it was not quite the masterpiece the occasion
demanded. It read:

       Arrived yesterday. Slept in jail. Out to-day.
Am not he.       

The operator, counting off the length with
his pencil, glanced up thoughtfully.

       It costs a dollar a word, sir,        he vouchsafed.

But Saxon nodded affluently, for he knew
that the City of Rio sailed north that afternoon,
and he did not know that her sister ship,
the Amazon, with Duska on board, was at this
moment nosing its way south through the
tepid water       only twenty-four hours away.

As the City of Rio wound up her rusty
anchor chains that afternoon, Saxon was jubilantly
smoking his pipe by the rail.

[Pg 166]
In the launch just putting off from the steamer       s
side stood the Hon. Mr. Pendleton, waving
his hat, and Jimmy Partridge wildly shouting,
       Give my regards to Broadway!        The
minister       s flag, which had floated over the
steamer while the great personage was on
board, was just dipping, and Saxon       s hand was
still cramped under the homesick pressure of
the farewell grips.

Suddenly, the traveler had a feeling of a
presence at his elbow, and, turning, was profoundly
astonished to behold again the complacent
visage of Mr. Rodman.

       You see, I still appear to be among those
present,        announced the filibuster, with some
breeziness of manner.        It       s true that I stand
before you,        my sweet young face still haggard
with the anguish it has worn,        but I       m
here, which is, after all, the salient feature of
the situation. Say, what did you do to them?       

       I?        questioned Saxon.        I did nothing.
The minister came and took me out of their
Bastile.       

       Well, say, he must have thrown an awful
scare into them.        Mr. Rodman thoughtfully
[Pg 167]
stroked his chin with a thin forefinger.        He
must have intimidated them unmercifully and
brutally. They stampeded into my wing of
the Palace, and set me free as though they were
afraid I had the yellow-fever.        Wide they
flung the massive portals              all that sort of
thing. Now, what puzzles me is, why did they
do it? They had the goods on me       almost.
However, I       m entirely pleased.        Rodman
laughed as he lighted a cigar, and waved his
hand with mock sentiment toward the shore.
       And I had put the rifles through, too,        he declared,
jubilantly.        I       d turned them over to
the insurrecto gentleman in good order. Did
they clamor for your blood about the $200,000?       

       Rodman,        said Saxon slowly,        I hardly
expect you to believe it, but that was a case of
mistaken identity. I       m not the man you think.
I was never in Puerto Frio before.       

Rodman let the cigar drop from his astonished
lips, and caught wildly after it as it fell
overboard.

       What?        he demanded, at last.        How       s
that?       

[Pg 168]
       It was a man who looked like me,        elucidated
Saxon.

       You are damned right       he looked like
you!        Rodman halted, amazed into silence. At
last, he said:        Well, you have got the clear
nerve! What       s the idea, anyhow. Don       t you
trust me?       

The artist laughed.

       I hardly thought you would credit it,        he
said.        After all, that doesn       t make much difference.
The point is, my dear boy, I know it.       

But Rodman       s debonair smile soon returned.
He held up his hand with a gesture of acceptance.

       What difference does it make? A gentleman
likes to change his linen       why not
his personality? I dare say it       s a very decent
impulse.       

For a moment, Saxon looked up with an instinctive
resentment for the politely phrased
skepticism of the other. Then, his displeasure
changed to a smile. He had, for a moment, felt
the same doubt when Mr. Pendleton brought
his verdict. Rodman had none of the facts, and
a glance at the satirical features showed that it
[Pg 169]
would be impossible for this unimaginative adventurer
to construe premises to a seemingly
impossible conclusion. He was the materialist,
and dealt in palpable appearances. After all,
what did it matter? He had made his effort,
and would, as he had promised Duska, vex his
Sphinx with no more questioning. He would
go on as Robert Saxon, feeling that he had
done his best with conscientious thoroughness.
It was, after all, only cutting the Gordian knot
in his life. After a moment, he looked up.

       Which way do you go?        he inquired.

The other man shrugged his shoulders.

       I go back to Puerto Frio       after the blow-off.       

       After the blow-off?        Saxon repeated, in interrogation.

       Sure!        Rodman stretched his thin hand
shoreward, and dropped his voice.        Take a
good look at yon fair city,        he laughed,        for,
before you happen back here again, it may have
fallen under fire and sword.       

The soldier of fortune spoke with some of
the pride that comes to the man who feels he
is playing a large game, whether it be a game
[Pg 170]
of construction or destruction, or whether, as
is oftener the case, it be both destruction and
construction.

The painter obediently looked back at the
adobe walls and cross-tipped towers.

       Puerto Frio has been very good to me,       
he said, in an enigmatical voice.

But Rodman was thinking too much of his
own plans to notice the comment.

       Do you see the mountain at the back of
the city?        he suddenly demanded.        That       s
San Francisco. Do you see anything queer
about it?       

The artist looked at the peak rearing its
summit against the hot blue overhead, and saw
only a sleeping tropical background for the
indolent tropical panorama stretching at its
base.

       Well               Rodman dropped his voice yet
lower              if you had a pair of field glasses and
studied the heights, you could see a few black
specks that are just now disused guns. By day
after to-morrow, or, at the latest, one day more,
each of those specks will be a crater, and the
town will be under a shower of solid shot.
[Pg 171]
There       s some class to work that can turn as
mild a mannered hill as that into a volcano       no?       

Saxon stood gazing with fascination.

       Meanwhile,        he heard the other comment,
       shipboard is good enough for yours truly       because,
as you know, shipboard is neutral
ground for political offenders       and the next
gentleman who occupies the Palace will be a
friend who owes me something.       





[Pg 172]

CHAPTER XI


Saxon denied himself the lure of the deck
that evening. Though he would probably be
close behind his messages in arriving, he was
devoting himself to a full narration embodied
in a love-letter.

He bent over the task in the closeness of the
dining saloon, with such absorption that he did
not rise to investigate even when, with a protracted
shrieking of whistles, there came sudden
cessation from the jarring throb of screw-shaft
and engines. Then, the City of Rio
came to a full stop. He vaguely presumed
that another important port had been reached,
and did not suspect that the vessel lay out
of sight of land, and that a second steamer,
southbound, had halted on signal, and lay likewise
motionless, her lights glittering just off
the starboard bow.

When, almost two hours later, he had folded
the last of many pages, and gone on deck for
[Pg 173]
a breath before turning in, the engines were
once more noisily throbbing, and he saw only
the bulk and lights of another vessel pointed
down-world under steam.

But, as usual, Rodman, gentleman of multifarious
devices, was not letting facts escape
him. Indeed, it was at Rodman       s instance that
two mail ships, the City of Rio and the
Amazon, had marked time for an hour and a
half. In the brewing of affairs, Rodman was
just now an important personage, and the commanders
of these lines were under instructions
from their offices to regard his requests as
orders, and to obey them with due respect and
profound secrecy. The shifting of administrations
at Puerto Frio meant certain advantages
in the way of concessions to gentlemen in Wall
Street whose word, with these steamers, was
something more than influential.

Mr. Rodman had been rowed across from
the Rio to the Amazon, and he had taken with
him the hand-luggage that made his only impedimenta.
In Mr. Rodman       s business, it was
important to travel light. If he found Se        or
Miraflores among the passengers of the
[Pg 174]
Amazon, it was his intention to right-about-face,
and return south again.

Se        or Miraflores had been in the States as
the secret and efficient head of that junta which
Rodman served. He had very capably directed
the shipping of rifles and many sub-rosa
details that must be handled beyond the frontier,
when it is intended to change governments
without the knowledge or consent of armed
and intrenched incumbents. The home-coming
of Se        or Miraflores must of necessity be unostentatious,
since his arrival would be the signal
for the conversion of the quiet steeps of San
Francisco into craters.

Rodman knew that, if the se        or were on
board the Amazon, his name would not be on
the sailing-list, and his august personality would
be cloaked in disguise. His point of debarkation
would be some secluded coast village where
fellow conspirators could hide him. His advent
into the capital itself would not be made at all
unless made at the head of an invading army,
and, if so made, he would remain as minister
of foreign affairs in the cabinet of
[Pg 175]
General Vegas, to whom just now, as to himself,
the city gates were closed.

But Se        or Miraflores had selected a more
cautious means of entry than the ship, which
might bear travelers who knew him. Rodman
spent an hour on the downward steamer. He
managed to see the face of every passenger,
and even investigated the swarthy visages in
the steerage. He asked of some tourists casual
questions as to destination, and chatted artlessly,
then went over the side again, and was rowed
back across the intervening strip of sea. Immediately
upon his departure overside, the
Amazon proceeded on her course, and five minutes
later the City of Rio was also under way.

The next morning, after a late breakfast,
Saxon was lounging at the rail amidship. He
had ceased looking backward, and all his gaze
was for the front. Ahead of him, the white
superstructure, the white-duck uniform of the
officer pacing the bridge, the whiteness of the
holystoned deck, all stood boldly out against
the deep cobalt of the gently swelling sea.
Saxon was satisfied with life, and, when he saw
[Pg 176]
Rodman sauntering toward him, he looked up
with a welcoming nod.

       Hello, Carter       I mean Saxon.        The gun-smuggler
corrected his form of address with a
laugh.

The breezy American was a changed and improved
man. The wrinkled gray flannels had
given way to natty white duck. His Panama
hat was new and of such quality that it could
be rolled and drawn through a ring as large as
a half-dollar. He was shaven to an extreme
pinkness of face. As Saxon glanced up, his
eyes wearing tell-tale recognition of the transformation,
the thin man laughed afresh.

       Notice the difference, don       t you?        he genially
inquired, rolling a cigarette.        The gray
grub is splendidly changed into the snow-white
butterfly. I       m a very flossy bug, eh, Saxon?       

The painter admitted the soft self-impeachment
with a qualification.

       I begin to think you are a very destructive
one.       

       I am,        announced Rodman, calmly.        I
could spin you many a yarn of intrigue, but
for the fact that, since you began wearing a halo
[Pg 177]
instead of a hat, you have become too sanctified
to listen.       

       Inasmuch,        smilingly suggested the painter,
       as we might yet be languishing in the cuartel
except for the fact that I was able to give so
good an account of myself, I don       t see that you
have any reasonable quarrel with my halo.       

Rodman raised his brows.

       Oh, I never lost sight of the fact that you
had some reason for the saint r       le, and, as you
say, I was in on the good results. But, now that
you are flitting northward, what       s the idea of
keeping your ears stopped?       

       They are open,        declared Mr. Saxon graciously;
       you are at liberty to tell me anything
you like, but only what you like. I       m not
thirsting for criminal confessions.       

       That       s all right, but you               Rodman
broke off, and his lips twisted into ironical good
humor              no, I apologize       I mean, a fellow
who looked remarkably like you used to be so
deeply versed in international politics that I
think this new adventure would appeal to you.
Ever remember hearing of one Se        or Miraflores?       

[Pg 178]
Saxon shook his head, whereupon Rodman
laughed with great sophistication. Carter had
known Se        or Miraflores quite well, and Rodman
knew that Carter had known him.

       Very consistent acting,        he approved.
       You       re a good comedian. In the Chinese
theaters, they put flour on the comedian       s nose
to show that he       s not a tragedian, but you don       t
need the badge. You       re all right. You know
how to get a laugh. But this isn       t dramatic
criticism. It       s wars and rumors of wars.       

The adventurer drew a long puff from his
cigarette, inhaled it deeply, and stood idly
watching the curls of outward-blown smoke
hanging in the hot air, before he went on.

       Well, Miraflores has once more been at the
helm. Of course, in the lower commissions of
the insurrecto organization, we have the usual
assortment of foreign officers, odds and ends,
but the chief difference between this enterprise
and the other one       the one Carter knew about       is
the fact that we have some artillery, and
that, when we start things going, we can come
pretty near battering down the old town.       

Rodman proceeded to sketch the outlines of
[Pg 179]
the conspiracy. It was much the stereotyped
arrangement with a few variations. Two regiments
in the city barracks, suspected of disloyalty,
had been practically disarmed by the
President, but these troops had been secretly rearmed
with a part of the guns brought in by
Rodman, and would be ready to rise at the signal,
together with several other disaffected commands       not
for the government, but against it.

The mountain of San Francisco is really not
a mountain at all, but a foot hill of the mountains.
Yet, it looks down on the city of Puerto
Frio as Marathon on the sea, and here are guns
trained inward as well as outward. These
guns can shell the capital into ruins in the space
of a few hours; then, they can hurl their projectiles
further, and play havoc with the environs.
Also, they can guard the city from the
approach that lies along the roads from the interior.
A commander who holds San Francisco
stands at the door of Puerto Frio with a
latch-key in his hand. The revolutionists under
Vegas had arranged their attack on the basis
of unwarned assault. The Dictator had indeed
some apprehensions, but they were fears for the
[Pg 180]
future       not for the immediate present. The
troops garrisoned on San Francisco, ostensibly
the loyal legion of the Dictator       s forces, were
in reality watching the outward approaches
only as doors through which they were to welcome
friends. The guns that were trained and
ready to belch fire on signal from Vegas, were
the guns trained inward on the city, and, when
they opened, the main plaza would resemble
nothing so much as the far end of a bowling
alley when an expert stands on the foul-line, and
the palace of the President would be the kingpin
for their gunnery. The insurrecto forces
were to enter San Francisco without resistance,
and the opening of its crater was to be the signal
for hurling through the streets of the city
itself those troops that had been secretly armed
with the smuggled weapons, completing the
confusion and throwing into stampeding panic
the demoralized remnants upon which the government
depended.

Unless there were a traitor in very exclusive
and carefully guarded councils, there would
hardly be a miscarriage of the plans.

Saxon stood idly listening to these
[Pg 181]
confidences. Nothing seemed strange to him, and
least of all the entire willingness of the conspirator
to tell him things that involved life
and death for men and governments. He knew
that, in spite of all he had said, or could say,
to the other man, he was the former ally in
crime. He had thought at first that Rodman
would ultimately discover some discrepancy in
appearance which would undeceive him, but
now he realized that the secret of the continued
mistake was an almost miraculous resemblance,
and the fact that the other man had, in the
former affair, met him in person only twice, and
that five years ago.

       And so,        went on Rodman in conclusion,
       I       m here adrift, waiting for the last act. I
thought Miraflores might possibly be on the
Amazon last night, and so, while you sat dawdling
over letter-paper and pen, little Howard
Stanley was up and doing. I went across to the
other boat, and made search, but it was another
case of nothing transpiring. Miraflores was
too foxy to go touring so openly.       

Saxon felt that some comment was expected
from him, yet his mind was wandering far
[Pg 182]
afield from the doings of juntas. All these
seemed as unreal as scenes from an extravagantly
staged musical comedy. What appeared
to him most real at that moment was the picture
of a slim girl walking, dryad-like, through
the hills of her Kentucky homeland, and the
thought that he would soon be walking with
her.

       It looks gloomy for the city,        he said, abstractedly.

       Say,        went on Rodman,        do you know
that the only people on that boat booked for
Puerto Frio were three fool American tourists,
and that, of the three, two were women? Now,
what chance have those folks got to enjoy themselves?
Do you think Puerto Frio, say day
after to-morrow, will make a hit with them?       
The informant laughed softly to himself, but
Saxon was still deep in his own thoughts. It
suddenly struck him with surprised discovery
that the view from the deck was beautiful. And
Rodman, also, felt the languid invitation of the
sea air, and it made him wish to talk. So, unmindful
of a self-absorbed listener, he went on
garrulously.

[Pg 183]
       You know, I felt like quoting to them,        Into
the jaws of death, into the mouth of hell, sailed
the three tourists,        but that would have been
to tip off state secrets. If people will fare
forth for adventure, I guess they       ve got to have
it.       

       Do you suppose,        asked Saxon perfunctorily,
       they       ll be in actual danger?       

       Danger!        repeated the filibuster with sarcasm.
       Danger, did you say? Oh, no, of course
not. It will be a pink tea! You know that
town as well as I do. You know there are two
places in it where American visitors can stop       the
Frances y Ingles, where you were, and the
American Legation. By day after to-morrow,
that plaza will be the bull       s-eye for General
Vegas       s target-practice. General Vegas has a
mountain to rest his target-gun on, and it       s
loaded with shell. Oh, no, there won       t be any
danger!       

       Wasn       t there some pretext on which you
could warn them off?        inquired the painter.

Rodman shook his head.

       You see, I have to be careful in my talk.
I might say too much. As it was, I knocked
[Pg 184]
the town to the fellow all I could. But he
seemed hell-bent on getting there, and getting
there quick. He was a fool Kentuckian, and
you can       t head off a bull-headed Kentuckian
with subtleties or hints. I       ve met one or two
of them before. And there was a girl along
who seemed as anxious to get there as he was.
That girl was all to the good!       

Saxon leaned suddenly forward.

       A Kentuckian?        he demanded.        Did you
hear his name?       

       Sure,        announced Mr. Rodman.        Little
Howard Stanley picks up information all along
the way. The chap was named George Steele,
and                     

But the speaker broke off in his story, to stand
astounded at the conduct of his auditor.

       And the girl!        shouted Saxon.        Her
name?       

       Her name,        replied the intriguer,        was
Miss Filson.       

Suddenly, the inattention of the other had
fallen away, and he had wheeled, his jaw dropping.
For an instant, he stood in an attitude
of bewildered shock, gripping the support of
[Pg 185]
the rail like a prize-fighter struggling against
the groggy blackness of the knock-out blow.

Saxon stood such a length of time as it might
have required for the referee to count nine over
him, had the support he gripped been that of
the prize-ring instead of the steamer       s rail.
Then, he stepped forward, and gripped Rodman       s
arm with fingers that bit into the flesh.

       Rodman,        he said in a low voice that was
almost a whisper, between his labored breathings,
       I       ve got to talk to you       alone. There       s
not a minute to lose. Come to my stateroom.       





[Pg 186]

CHAPTER XII


Below, in the narrow confines of the cabin,
Saxon paced back and forth excitedly as he
talked. For five minutes, he did not pause, and
the other man, sitting on the camp-stool in a
corner of the place, followed him with eyes
much as a lion-tamer, shut in a cage with his
uncertain charge, keeps his gaze bent on the
animal. As he listened, Rodman       s expression
ran a gamut from astonishment, through sympathy,
and into final distrust. At last, Saxon
ended with:

       And, so, I       ve got to get them away from
there. I       ve got to get back to that town,
and you must manage it. For God       s sake, don       t
delay!        The painter had not touched on the
irrelevant point of his own mystery, or why the
girl had followed him. That would have been
a story the other would not have believed, and
there was no time for argument and futile personalities.
The slow northward fifteen knots
had all at once become a fevered racing in the
[Pg 187]
wrong direction, and each throb of the shafts
in the engine-room seemed to hurl him madly
through space away from his goal.

When he halted in his narrative, the other
man looked sternly up, and his sharp features
were decisively set.

       Suppose I should get you there,        he began
swiftly.        Suppose it were possible to get back
in time, what reason have I to trust you? Suppose
I were willing to trust you absolutely,
what right have I       a mere agent of a cause
that       s bigger than single lives       to send you back
there, where a word from you would spoil everything?
My God, man, there are thousands of
people there who are risking their lives to
change this government. Hundreds of them
must die to do it. For months, we have worked
and planned, covering and secreting every detail
of our plotting. We have all taken our
lives in our hands. Now, a word of warning,
an indiscreet act, the changing of the garrison
on San Francisco, and where would we be?
Every platoon that follows Vegas and Miraflores
marches straight into a death-trap! The
signal is given, and every man goes to destruction
[Pg 188]
as swift as a bat out of hell. That       s what
you are asking me to do       to play traitor to my
cause. And you calmly tell me I must do it
simply because you       ve got friends in town.       

The man came to his feet with an excited
gesture of anger.

       You know that in this business no man can
trust his twin brother, and you ask me to trust
you to the extent of laying in your hands everything
I       ve worked for       the lives of an army!       
His tones rose to a climax of vehemence:        And
that       s what you ask!       

       You know you can trust me,        began Saxon,
conscious of the feeble nature of his argument.
       You didn       t have to tell me. I didn       t ask your
confidence. I warned you not to tell me.       

       Maybe I was a damned fool, and maybe
you were pretty slick, playing me along with
your bait of indifference,        retorted Rodman,
hotly.        How am I to know whom you really
mean to warn? You insist that I shall harbor a
childlike faith in you, yet you won       t trust me
enough to quit your damned play-acting. You
call on me to believe in you, yet you lie to me,
and cling to your smug alias. You won       t
[Pg 189]
confess who you are, though you know I know it.
No, Mr. Carter, I must decline.       

Saxon stood white and rigid. Every moment
wasted in argument imperiled more deeply the
girl and the friends he must save, for whose
hazarded lives he was unwittingly responsible.
Yet, he could do nothing except with Rodman       s
assistance. The only chance lay in convincing
him, and that must be done at any cost. This
was no time for selecting methods.

       I don       t have to tell a syllable of your
plans,        he contended, desperately.        They will
go with me without asking the reason. I have
only to see them. You have my life in your
hands: you can go with me. You can disarm
me, and keep me in view every moment of the
time. You can kill me at the first false move.
You can                     

       Cut out the tommy-rot,        interrupted Rodman,
with fierce bluntness.        I can do better
than that, and you know it. My word on this
ship goes the same as if I were an admiral. I
can say to the captain that you assaulted me,
and it will be my testimony against yours. I
can have you put in irons, and thrown down in
[Pg 190]
the hold, and, by God, I       m going to do it!       
The man moved toward the cabin bell, and
halted with his finger near the button.        Now,
damn you! my platform is Vegas y Libertad,
and I       m not the sucker I may have seemed.
If this is a trick of yours, you aren       t going to
have the chance to turn it.       

       Give me a moment,        pleaded Saxon. He
realized with desperation that every word the
other spoke was true, that he was helpless
unless he could be convincing.

       Listen, Rodman,        he hurried on, ready to
surrender everything else if he could carry his
own point.        For God       s sake, listen to me!
You trusted me in the first place. I could have
left the boat at any point, and wired back!        He
looked into the face of the other man so steadily
and with such hypnotic intensity that his own
eyes were the strongest argument of truth he
could have put forward.

       You say I have distrusted you, that I have
not admitted my identity as Carter. I don       t
care a rap for my life. I       m not fighting for
that now. I have no designs on you or your
designs. Let me put a hypothetical question:
[Pg 191]
Suppose you had come to a point where your
past life was nothing more to you than the life
of another man       a man you hated as your
deadliest enemy; suppose you lived in a world
that was as different from the old one as though
it had never existed; suppose a woman had
guided you into that new world, would you, or
would you not, turn your back on the old? Suppose
you learned as suddenly as I learned, from
you, on deck, that that woman was in danger,
would you, or would you not, go to her?       

Men rarely find the most eloquent or convincing
words when they stand at sudden crises, but
usually men       s voices and manners at such times
can have a force of convincing veracity that
means more. Possibly, it may have been the
hypnotic quality of Saxon       s eyes, but, whatever
it was, Rodman found it impossible to disbelieve
him when he spoke in this fashion. In
the plaza, he had suddenly turned the scales and
held power of life and death over Rodman,
and his only emotion had been that of heart-broken
misery. Carter had been, like Rodman
himself, the intriguer, but he had always been
trustworthy with his friends. He had been
[Pg 192]
violent, bitter, avenging, but never mean in
small ways. That had been one of the reasons
why Rodman, once convinced that the danger
of vengeance was ended, had remained almost
passionately anxious to prove to the other that
he himself had not been a traitor. Carter had
been the Napoleonic adventurer, and Rodman
only the pettier type. For Carter, he held a
sort of hero-worship. Rodman       s methods were
those of chicane, but rightly or wrongly he believed
that he could read the human document.

If this other man were telling the truth, and
if love of a woman were his real motive, he
could be stung into fury with a slur. If that
were only a pretext, the other would not allow
his resentment to imperil his plans       he would
repress it, or simulate it awkwardly.

       So,        he commented satirically,        it       s the
good-looking young female that       s got you buffaloed,
is it? The warrior has been taken into
camp by the squaw.        The tone held deliberate
intent to insult.

Saxon       s lips compressed themselves into a
dangerously straight line, and his face whitened
to the temples. As he took a step
[Pg 193]
forward, the slighter man stepped quickly back,
and raised a hand with a gesture of explanation.
Saxon had evidently told the truth. The revolutionist
had satisfied himself, and his somewhat
erratic method of judging results had
been to his own mind convincing. And, at the
same moment, Saxon halted. He realized that
he stood in a position where questions of life
and death, not his own, were involved. His
anger was driving him dangerously close to action
that would send crashing to ruin the one
chance of winning an effective ally. He half-turned
with something like a groan.

He was called out of his stupor of anxiety
by the voice of the other. Rodman had been
thinking fast. He would take a chance, though
not such a great chance as it would seem. Indeed,
in effect, he would be taking the other
prisoner. He would in part yield to the request,
but in the method that occurred to him
he would have an ample opportunity of studying
the other man under conditions which the
other man would not suspect. He would have
Saxon at all times in his power and under his
observation while he set traps for him. If his
[Pg 194]
surmise of sincerity proved false, he could act
at once as he chose, before Saxon would have
the opportunity to make a dangerous move.
He would seem to do a tremendously hazardous
thing in the name of friendship, but all the
while he would have the cards stacked. If at
the proper moment he still believed in the other,
he would permit the man, under supervision, to
save these friends. If not, Rodman would still
be master of the situation. Besides, he had
been seriously disappointed in not meeting
Miraflores. He had felt that there might yet
be advantages in coming closer to the theater
of the drama than this vessel going north,
though he must still remain under the protection
of a foreign flag.

       So, you are willing to admit that your proper
name is Mr. Carter?        he demanded, coolly.

       I am willing to admit anything, if I can get
to Puerto Frio and through the lines,        responded
Saxon, readily.

       If I take you back, you will go unarmed,
under constant supervision,        stipulated Rodman.
       You will have to obey my orders, and
devise some pretext for enticing your friends
[Pg 195]
away, without telling them the true reason. I
shall be running my neck into a noose perhaps.
I have no right to run that of Vegas y Libertad
into a noose as well. Are those terms satisfactory?       

       Absolutely!        Saxon let more eagerness
burst from his lips than he had intended.

       Then, come with me to the captain.        Suddenly,
Rodman wheeled, and looked at the other
man with a strange expression.        Do you know
why I       m doing this? It       s a fool reason, but I
want to prove to you that I       m not the sort that
would be apt to turn an ally over to his executioners.
That       s why.       

Five minutes later, the two stood in the captain       s
cabin, and Saxon noted that the officer
treated Rodman with a manner of marked deference.

       Is Cartwright       s steam yacht still at Mollera?       
demanded the soldier of fortune, incisively.

       It       s held there for emergencies,        replied the
officer.

       It       s our one chance! Mr. Saxon and
myself must get to Puerto Frio at once. When
[Pg 196]
do we strike Mollera?        Rodman consulted
his watch.

       In an hour.       

       Have us put off there. Send a wireless to
the yacht to have steam up, and arrange for
clearance. Put on all steam ahead for Mollera.       

It was something, reflected Saxon, to have
such toys to play with as this thin ally of his
could, for the moment at least, command.

       Now, I fully realize,        said Rodman, as they
left the captain       s cabin together,        that I       m embarking
on the silliest enterprise of a singularly
silly career. But I       m no quitter. Cartwright,       
he explained,        is one of the owners of the line.
He       s letting his yacht be used for a few things
where it comes in handy.       

There was time to discuss details on the way
down the coast in the Phyllis. The yacht
had outwardly all the idle ease of a craft designed
merely for luxurious loafing over smooth
seas, but Cartwright had built it with one or
two other requisite qualities in mind. The
Phyllis could show heels, if ever matters
came to a chase, to anything less swift than a
[Pg 197]
torpedo-boat destroyer. Her mastheads were
strung with the parallel wires that gave her
voice in the Marconi tongue, and Saxon had no
sooner stepped over the side than he realized
that the crew recognized in Mr. Rodman a person
to be implicitly obeyed.

If Rodman had seemed to be won over with
remarkable suddenness to Saxon       s request that
he undertake a dangerous rescue, it was now
evident to the painter that the appearance had
been in part deceiving. Here, he was more at
Rodman       s mercy than he had been on the
steamer. If Rodman       s word had indeed been
as he boasted, that of an admiral on the City
of Rio, it was, on the Phyllis, that of an
admiral on his own flagship. By a thousand
little, artful snares thrown into their discussions
of ways and means, Rodman sought to
betray the other into any utterance or action
that might show underlying treachery, and, before
the yacht had eaten up the route back to
the strip of coast where the frontier stretched
its invisible line, he had corroborated his belief
that the artist was telling the truth. Had he
not been convinced, Rodman had only to speak,
[Pg 198]
and every man from the skipper to the Japanese
cabin boy would have been obedient to his
orders.

       We will not try to get to Puerto Frio harbor,       
explained Rodman.        It would hardly be
safe. We shall steam past the city, and anchor
at Bellavista, five miles beyond. Bellavista is
a seaside resort, and there a boat like this will
attract less attention. Also, the consulate is better
suited to our needs as to the formalities of
entering and leaving port. There, we will take
horses, and ride to town. I       ll read the signs,
and, if things look safe, we can get in, collect
your people, and get out again at once. They
can go with us to the yacht, and, if you like fireworks,
we can view them from a safe distance.       

La Punta, as they passed, lay sleepy by her
beach, her tattered palms scarcely stirring their
fronds in the breathless air. Later, Puerto Frio
went alongside, as quiet and untouched with any
sense of impending disturbance as the smaller
town. Behind the scattered outlying houses, the
incline went up to the base of San Francisco,
basking in the sun. The hill was a huge, inert
barrier between the green and drab of the earth
[Pg 199]
and the blue of the sky. Saxon drew a long
breath as he watched it in the early morning
when they passed. It was difficult to think of
even an artificial volcano awakening from such
profound slumber and indolence.

       You       d better go below, and get ready for
the ride. We go horseback. Got any riding
togs?        Rodman spoke rapidly, in crisp brevities.
       No? Well, I guess we can rig you out.
Cartwright has all sorts of things on board.
Change into them quick. You won       t need anything
else. This is to be a quick dash.       

When the anchor dropped off Bellavista,
Saxon stood in a fever of haste on deck, garbed
in riding-clothes that almost fitted him, though
they belonged to Cartwright or some of the
guests who had formerly been pleasuring on the
yacht.

As their motor-boat was making its way shoreward
over peacefully glinting water, the painter
ran his hand into his coat-pocket for a handkerchief.
He found that he had failed to provide
himself. The other pockets were equally
empty, save for what money had been loose in
his trousers-pocket when he changed, and the
[Pg 200]
old key he always carried there. These things
he had unconsciously transferred by mere force
of habit. Everything else he had left behind.
He felt a mild sense of annoyance. He had
wanted, on meeting her, to hand Duska the letter
he had written on the night that their ships
passed, but haste was the watchword, and one
could not turn back for such trifles as pocket
furnishings.

Rodman proved the best of guides. He knew
a liveryman from whom Argentine ponies could
be obtained, and led the way at a brisk canter
out the smooth road toward the capital.

For a time, the men rode in silence between
the haciendas, between scarlet clustered vines,
clinging with heavy fragrance to adobe walls,
and the fringed spears of palms along the cactus-lined
roadsides.

Hitherto, the man       s painting sense had lain
dormant. Now, despite his anxiety and the
nervous prodding of his heels into the flanks of
his vicious little mount, he felt that he was going
toward Duska, and with the realization came
satisfaction. For a time, his eyes ceased to be
those of the man hurled into new surroundings
[Pg 201]
and circumstances, and became again those of
Frederick Marston       s first disciple.

They rode before long into the country that
borders the town. Rodman       s eyes were fixed
with a fascinated gaze on the quiet summit of
San Francisco. He had himself no definite
knowledge when the craters might open, and
as yet he had seen no sign of war. The initial
note must of course come drifting with the first
wisp of smoke and the first detonation from the
mouths of those guns.

At the outskirts of the town, they turned a
sharp angle hidden behind high monastery
walls, and found themselves confronted by a
squad of native soldiery with fixed bayonets.

With an exclamation of surprise, Rodman
drew his pony back on its flanks. For a moment,
he leaned in his saddle, scrutinizing the
men who had halted him. There was, of course,
no distinction of uniforms, but he reasoned that
no government troops would be guarding that
road, because, as far as the government knew,
there was no war. He leaned over and whispered:

       Vegas y Libertad.       

[Pg 202]
The sergeant in command saluted with a
grave smile, and drew his men aside, as the two
horsemen rode on.

       Looks like it       s getting close,        commented
Rodman shortly.        We       d better hurry.       

Where the old market-place stands at the
junction of the Calle Bolivar with a lesser street,
Rodman again drew down his pony, and his
cheeks paled to the temples. From the center
of the city came the sudden staccato rattle of
musketry. The plotter threw his eyes up to the
top of San Francisco, visible above the roofs,
but the summit of San Francisco still slept the
sleep of quiet centuries. Then, again, came the
clatter from the center of the town, and again
the sharp rattle of rifle fire ripped the air.
There was heavy fighting somewhere on ahead.

       Good God!        breathed the thin man.
       What does it mean?       

The two ponies stood in the narrow street,
and the air began to grow heavier with the
noise of volleys, yet the hill was silent.

Rodman rattled his reins on the pony       s neck,
and rode apathetically forward. Something
had gone amiss! His dreams were crumbling.
[Pg 203]
At the next corner, they drew to one side. A
company of troops swept by on the double-quick.
They had been in action. Their faces
streamed with sweat, and many were bleeding.
A few wounded men were being carried by their
comrades. Rodman recognized Capitan Morino,
and shouted desperately; but the officer
shook his head wildly, and went on.

Then, they saw a group of officers at the door
of a crude caf        . Among them, Rodman recognized
Colonel Marti        ez, of Vegas        staff, and
Colonel Murphy of the Foreign Legion, yet
they stood here idle, and their faces told the
story of defeat. The filibuster hurled himself
from the saddle, and pushed his way to the
group, followed by Saxon.

       What does it mean, Murphy?        he demanded,
breathlessly.        What in all hell can it
mean?       

Murphy looked up. He was wrapping his
wrist with a handkerchief, one end of which he
held between his teeth. Red spots were slowly
spreading on the white of the bandage.

       Sure, it means hell       s broke loose,        replied
the soldier of fortune, with promptness. Then,
[Pg 204]
seeing Saxon, he shot him a quick glance of
recognition. The eyes were weary, and showed
out of a face pasted with sweat and dust.

       Hello, Carter,        he found time to say.
       Glad you       re with us       but it       s all up with our
outfit.       

This time, Saxon did not deny the title.

       What happened?        urged Rodman, in a
frenzy of anxiety. The roaring of rifles did
not seem to come nearer, except for detached
sounds of sporadic skirmishing. The central
plaza and its environs were holding the interest
of the combatants.

       Sure, it means there was a leak. When the
boys marched up to San Francisco, they were
met with artillery fire. It had been tipped off,
and the government had changed the garrison.       
The Irish adventurer, who had led men under
half a dozen tatterdemalion flags, smiled sarcastically.
       Sure, it was quite simple!       

       And where is the fighting?        shouted Rodman,
as though he would hold these men responsible
for his shattered scheme of empire.

       Everywhere. Vegas was in too deep to
pull out. The government couldn       t shell its
[Pg 205]
own capital, and so it       s street to street scrappin       
now. But we       re licked unless               He halted
suddenly, with the gleam of an inspired idea in
his eyes. The leader of the Foreign Legion
was sitting on a table. Saxon noted for the first
time that, besides the punctured wrist, he was
disabled with a broken leg.

       Unless what?        questioned Colonel Marti        ez.
That officer was pallid under his dark
skin from loss of blood. One arm was bandaged
tightly against his side.

       Unless we can hold them for a time, and get
word to the diplomatic corps to arbitrate. A
delay would give us a bit of time to pull ourselves
together.       

Marti        ez, shrugged his shoulders.

       Impossible,        he said, drearily.

       Wait. Pendleton, the American minister,
is dean of the corps. Carter here is practically
a stranger in town these days, and he       s got
nerve. I know him. As an American, he might
possibly make it to the legation. Carter, will
you try to get through the streets to the American
Legation? Will you?       

Saxon had leaped forward. He liked the
[Pg 206]
direct manner of this man, and the legation was
his destination.

       It       s a hundred to one shot, Carter, that ye
can       t do it.        Murphy       s voice, in its excitement,
dropped into brogue.        Will ye try? Will ye
tell him to git th        diplomats togither, and ask
an armistice? Ye know our countersign,        Vegas
y Libertad.              

But Saxon had already started off in the general
direction of the main plaza. For two
squares, he met no interference. For two more,
he needed no other passport than the countersign,
then, as he turned a corner, it seemed to
him that he plunged at a step into a reek of
burnt powder and burning houses. There was a
confused vista of men in retreat, a roar that
deafened him, and a sudden numbness. He
dropped to his knees, attempted to rise to his
feet, then seemed to sink into a welcome sleep,
as he stretched comfortably at length on the
pavement close to a wall, a detachment of
routed insurrectos sweeping by him in full flight.





[Pg 207]

CHAPTER XIII


The passing of the fugitive insurrectos;
their mad turning at bay for one savage rally;
their wavering and breaking; their disorganized
stampede spurred on by a decimating fire
and the bayonet       s point: these were all incidents
of a sudden squall that swept violently through
the narrow street, to leave it again empty and
quiet. It was empty except for the grotesque
shapes that stretched in all the undignified awkwardness
of violent death and helplessness,
feeding thin lines of red that trickled between
the cobblestones. It was silent except for echoes
of the stubborn fighting coming from the freer
spaces of the plazas and alamedas, where the
remnants of the invading force clung to their
positions behind improvised barricades with the
doggedness of men for whom surrender holds
no element of hope or mercy.

Into the canyon-like street where the frenzy
of combat had blazed up with such a sudden
spurt and burned itself out so quickly, Saxon
[Pg 208]
had walked around the angle of a wall, just in
time to find himself precipitated into one of the
fiercest incidents of the bloody forenoon.

Vegas and Miraflores had not surrendered.
Everywhere, the insistent noise told that the opposing
forces were still debating every block of
the street, but in many outlying places, as in this
calle, the revolutionists were already giving
back. The attacking army had counted on
launching a blow, paralyzing in its surprise, and
had itself encountered surprise and partial preparedness.
It had set its hope upon a hill, and
the hill had failed. A prophet might already
read that Vegas y Libertad was the watchword
of a lost cause, and that its place in history belonged
on a page to be turned down.

But the narrow street in which Saxon lay remained
quiet. An occasional balcony window
would open cautiously, and an occasional head
would be thrust out to look up and down its
length. An occasional shape on the cobbles
would moan painfully, and shift its position with
the return of consciousness, or grow more grotesque
in the stiffness of death as the hours wore
into late afternoon, but the great iron-studded
[Pg 209]
street-doors of the houses remained barred, and
no one ventured along the sidewalks.

Late in the day, when the city still echoed to
the snapping of musketry, and deeper notes
rumbled through the din, as small field-pieces
were brought to bear upon opposing barricades,
the thing that Saxon had undertaken to bring
about occurred of its own initiative. Word
reached the two leaders that the representatives
of the foreign powers requested an armistice
for the removal of the wounded and a conference
at the American Legation, looking toward
possible adjustment. Both the government and
the insurrecto commanders grasped at the opportunity
to let their men, exhausted with close-fighting,
catch a breathing space, and to remove
from the zone of fire those who lay disabled in
the streets.

Then, as the firing subsided, some of the
bolder civilians ventured forth in search for such
acquaintances as had been caught in the streets
between the impact of forces in the unwarned
battle. For this hour, at least, all men were
safe, and there were some with matters to arrange,
who might not long enjoy immunity.

[Pg 210]
Among them was Howard Rodman, who followed
up the path he fancied Saxon must have
taken. Rodman was haggard and distrait.
His plans were all in ruins, and, unless an amnesty
were declared, he must be once more the
refugee. His belief that Saxon was really Carter
led him into two false conclusions. First, he
inferred from this premise that Saxon       s life
would be as greatly imperiled as his own, and
it followed that he, being in his own words        no
quitter,        must see Saxon out of the city, if the
man were alive. He presumed that in the effort
to reach the legation Saxon had taken, as would
anyone familiar with the streets, a circuitous
course which would bring him to the        Club Nacional,       
from which point he could reach the
house he sought over the roofs. He had no
doubt that the American had failed in his mission,
because, by any route, he must make his
way through streets where he would encounter
fighting.

Rodman       s search became feverish. There
was little time to lose. The conference might
be brief       and, after that, chaos! But fortune
favored him. Chance led him into the right
[Pg 211]
street, and he found the body. Being alone, he
stood for a moment indecisive. He was too
light a man to carry bodily the wounded friend
who lay at his feet. He could certainly not
leave the man, for his ear at the chest, his finger
on the pulse, assured him that Saxon was
alive. He had been struck by a falling timber
from a balcony above, and the skull seemed
badly hurt, probably fractured.

As Rodman stood debating the dilemma, a
shadow fell across the pavement. He turned
with a nervous start to recognize at his back a
newcomer, palpably a foreigner and presumably
a Frenchman, though his excellent English,
when he spoke, was only slightly touched with
accent. The stranger dropped to his knee, and
made a rapid examination, as Rodman had done.
It did not occur to him at the moment that the
man standing near him was an acquaintance of
the other who lay unconscious at their feet.

       The gentleman is evidently a non-combatant       and
he is badly hurt, monsieur,        he volunteered.
       We most assuredly cannot leave
him here to die.       

Rodman answered with some eagerness:

[Pg 212]
       Will you help me to carry him to a place
where he       ll be safe?       

       Gladly.        The Frenchman looked about.
       Surely, he can be cared for near here.       

But Rodman laid a persuasive hand on the
other       s arm.

       He must be taken to the water front,        he
declared, earnestly.        After the conference, he
would not be safe here.       

The stranger drew back, and stood for a moment
twisting his dark mustache, while his eyes
frowned inquiringly. He was disinclined to
take part in proceedings that might have political
after-effects. He had volunteered to assist
an injured civilian, not a participant, or refugee.
There were many such in the streets.

       This is a matter of life and death,        urged
Rodman, rapidly.        This man is Mr. Robert
Saxon. He had left this coast with a clean bill
of health. I explain all this because I need your
help. When he had made a part of his return
journey, he learned by chance that the city was
threatened, and that a lady who was very important
to him was in danger. He hastened
back. In order to reach her, he became
[Pg 213]
involved, and used the insurrecto countersign.
Mr. Saxon is a famous artist.        Rodman was
giving the version of the story he knew the
wounded man would wish to have told. He
said nothing of Carter.

At the last words, the stranger started forward.

       A famous painter!        His voice was full
of incredulous interest.        Monsieur, you can
not by any possibility mean that this is Robert
A. Saxon, the first disciple of Frederick Marston!       
The man       s manner became enthused
and eager.        You must know, monsieur,        he
went on,        that I am Louis Herv        , myself a
poor copyist of the great Marston. At one
time, I had the honor to be his pupil. To me, it
is a pleasure to be of any service to Mr. Saxon.
What are we to do?       

       There is a small sailors        tavern near the
mole,        directed Rodman;        we must take him
there. I shall find a way to have him cared for
on a vessel going seaward. I have a yacht five
miles away, but we can hardly reach it in time.       

       But medical attention!        demurred Monsieur
Herv        .        He must have that.       

[Pg 214]
Rodman was goaded into impatience by the
necessity for haste. He was in no mood for
debate.

       Yes, and a trained nurse!        he retorted,
hotly.        We must do the best we can. If
we don       t hurry, he will need an undertaker and
a coroner. Medical attention isn       t very good in
Puerto Frio prisons!       

The two men lifted Saxon between them, and
carried the unconscious man toward the mole.

Their task was like that of many others.
They passed a sorry procession of litters,
stretchers, and bodies hanging limply in the
arms of bearers. No one paid the slightest attention
to them, except an occasional sentry who
gazed on in stolid indifference.

At the tavern kept by the Chinaman, Juan,
and frequented by the roughest elements that
drift against a coast such as this, Rodman exchanged
greetings with many acquaintances.
There were several wounded officers of the
Vegas contingent, taking advantage of the armistice
to have their wounds dressed and discuss
affairs over a bottle of wine. Evidently,
they had come here instead of to more central
[Pg 215]
and less squalid places, with the same idea that
had driven Rodman. They were the rats about
to leave the sinking ship       if they could find a
way to leave.

The tavern was an adobe building with a corrugated-iron
roof and a large open patio, where
a dismal fountain tinkled feebly, and one or
two frayed palms stood dusty and disconsolate
in the tightly trodden earth. About the walls
were flamboyant portraits of saints. From a
small perch in one corner, a yellow and green
parrot squawked incessantly.

But it was the life about the rough tables of
the area that gave the picture its color and variety.
Some had been pressed into service to
support the wounded. About others gathered
men in tattered uniforms; men with bandaged
heads and arms in slings. Occasionally, one saw
an alien, a sailor whose clothes declared him to
have no place in the drama of the scene. These
latter were usually bolstering up their bravado
with aguardiente against the sense of impending
uncertainty that freighted the atmosphere.

The Frenchman, sharing with Rodman the
burden of the unconscious painter, instinctively
[Pg 216]
halted as the place with its wavering shadows
and flickering lights met his gaze at the door.
It was a picture of color and dramatic intensity.
He seemed to see these varied faces, upon which
sat defeat and suffering, sketched on a broad
canvas, as Marston or Saxon might have
sketched them.

Then, he laid Saxon down on a corner table,
and stood watching his chance companion who
recognized brother intriguers. Suddenly, Rodman       s
eyes brightened, and he beckoned his lean
hand toward two men who stood apart. Both
of them had faces that were in strong contrast
to the swarthy Latin-American countenances
about them. One was thin and blond, the
other dark and heavy. The two came across
the patio together, and after a hasty glance the
slender man bent at once over the prostrate
figure on the table. His deft fingers and manner
proclaimed him the surgeon. His uniform
was nondescript; hardly more a uniform than
the riding clothes worn by Saxon himself, but
on his shoulders he had pinned a major       s straps.
This was Dr. Cornish, of the Foreign Legion,
but for the moment he was absorbed in his work
[Pg 217]
and forgetful of his disastrously adopted profession
of arms.

He called for water and bandages, and, while
he worked, Rodman was talking with the other
man. Herv         stood silently looking on. He
recognized that the dark man was a ship-captain       probably
commanding a tramp freighter.

       When did you come?        inquired Rodman.

       Called at this port for coal,        responded the
other.        I       ve been down to Rio with flour, and
I have to call at La Guayra. I sail in two
hours.       

       Where do you go from Venezuela?       

       I sailed out of Havre, and I       m going back
with fruit. The Doc       s had about enough. I       m
goin        to take him with me.       

For a moment, Rodman stood speculating,
then he bent eagerly forward.

       Paul,        he whispered,        you know me. I       ve
done you a turn or two in the past.       

The sailor nodded.

       Now, I want you to do me a turn. I want
you to take this man with you. He must get
out of here, and he can       t care for himself. He       ll
be all right       either all right or dead       before
[Pg 218]
you land on the other side. The Doc here will
look after him. He       s got money. Whatever
you do for him, he       ll pay handsomely. He       s a
rich man.        The filibuster was talking rapidly
and earnestly.

       Where do I take him?        asked the captain,
with evident reluctance.

       Wherever you       re going; anywhere away
from here. He       ll make it all right with you.       

The captain caught the surgeon       s eyes, and
the surgeon nodded.

Rodman suddenly remembered Saxon       s story,
the story of the old past that was nothing
more to him than another life, and the other
man upon whom he had turned his back. Possibly,
there might even be efforts at locating the
conspirators. He leaned over, and, though he
sunk his voice low, Herv         heard him say:

       This gentleman doesn       t want to be found
just now. If people ask about him, you don       t
know who he is, comprende?       

       That       s no lie, either,        growled the ship-master.
       I ain       t got an idea who he is. I
ain       t sure I want him on my hands.       

A sudden quiet came on the place. An officer
[Pg 219]
had entered the door, his face pale, and, as
though with an instantaneous prescience that he
bore bad tidings, the noises dropped away. The
officer raised his hand, and his words fell on absolute
silence as he said in Spanish:

       The conference is ended. Vegas surrenders       without
terms.       

       You see!        exclaimed Rodman, excitedly.
       You see, it       s the last chance! Paul, you       ve got
to take him! In a half-hour, the armistice will
be over. For God       s sake, man!        He ended
with a gesture of appeal.

The place began to empty.

       Get him to my boat, then,        acceded the
captain.        Here, you fellows, lend a hand.
Come on, Doc.        The man who had a ship at
anchor was in a hurry.        Don       t whisper that
I       m sailing; I can       t carry all the people that
want to leave this town to-night. I       ve got to
slip away. Hurry up.       

A quarter of an hour later, Herv         stood at
the mole with Rodman, watching the row-boat
that took the other trio out to the tramp
steamer, bound ultimately for France. Rodman
seized his watch, and studied its face under a
[Pg 220]
street-lamp with something akin to frantic
anxiety.

       Where do you go, monsieur?        inquired
the Frenchman.

       Go? God knows!        replied Rodman, as he
gazed about in perplexity.        But I       ve got to
beat it, and beat it quick.       

A moment later, he was lost in the shadows.





[Pg 221]

CHAPTER XIV


When Duska Filson had gone out into the
woods that day to read Saxon       s runaway letter,
she had at once decided to follow, with regal
disdain of half-way methods. To her own
straight-thinking mind, unhampered with petty
conventional intricacies, it was all perfectly
clear. The ordinary woman would have waited,
perhaps in deep distress and tearful anxiety, for
some news of the man she loved, because he had
gone away, and it is not customary for the
woman to follow her wandering lover over a
quadrant of the earth       s circumference. Duska
Filson was not of the type that sheds tears or
remains inactive. To one man in the world,
she had said,        I love you,        and to her that settled
everything. He had gone to the place
where his life was imperiled in the effort to
bring back to her a clear record. If he were
fortunate, her congratulation, direct from her
own heart and lips, should be the first he heard.
If he were to be plunged into misery, then above
[Pg 222]
all other times she should be there. Otherwise,
what was the use of loving him?

But, when the steamer was under way, crawling
slowly down the world by the same route he
had taken, the days between quick sunrise and
sudden sunset seemed interminable.

Outwardly, she was the blithest passenger on
the steamer, and daily she held a sort of salon
for the few other passengers who were doomed
to the heat and the weariness of such a voyage.

But, when she was alone with Steele in the
evening, looking off at the moonlit sea, or in
her own cabin, her brow would furrow, and her
hands would clench with the tensity of her anxiety.
And, when at last Puerto Frio showed
across the purple water with a glow of brief
sunset behind the brown shoulder of San Francisco,
she stood by the rail, almost holding her
breath in suspense, while the anchor chains ran
out.

As soon as Steele had ensconced Mrs. Horton
and Duska at the Frances y Ingles, he hurried
to the American Legation for news of
Saxon. When he left Duska in the hotel patio,
he knew, from the anxious little smile she threw
[Pg 223]
after him, that for her the jury deciding the
supreme question was going out, leaving her as
a defendant is left when the panel files into the
room where they ballot on his fate. He rushed
over to the legation with sickening fear that,
when he came back, it might have to be like
the juryman whose verdict is adverse.

As it happened, he caught Mr. Pendleton
without delay, and before he had finished his
question the envoy was looking about for his
Panama hat. Mr. Pendleton wanted to do several
things at once. He wanted to tell the story
of Saxon       s coming and going, and he wanted to
go in person, and have the party moved over
to the legation, where they must be his guests
while they remained in Puerto Frio. It would
be several days before another steamer sailed
north. They had missed by a day the vessel on
which Saxon had gone. Meanwhile, there were
sights in the town that might beguile the intervening
time. Saxon had interested the envoy,
and Saxon       s friends were welcome. Hospitality
is simplified in places where faces from God       s
country are things to greet with the fervor of
delight.

[Pg 224]
At dinner that evening, sitting at the right
of the minister, Duska heard the full narrative
of Saxon       s brief stay and return home. Mr.
Pendleton was at his best. There was no diplomatic
formality, and the girl, under the reaction
and relief of her dispelled anxiety, though
still disappointed at the hapless coincidence of
missing Saxon, was as gay and childlike as
though she had not just emerged from an overshadowing
uncertainty.

       I       m sorry that he couldn       t accept my hospitality
here at the legation,        said the minister
at the end of his story, with much mock
solemnity,        but etiquette in diplomatic circles
is quite rigid, and he had an appointment to
sleep at the palace.       

       So, they jugged him!        chuckled Steele, with
a grin that threatened his ears.        I always suspected
he       d wind up in the Bastile.       

       He was,        corrected the girl, her chin high,
though her eyes sparkled,        a guest of the President,
and, as became his dignity, was supplied
with a military escort.       

       He needn       t permit himself any vaunting
pride about that,        Steele assured her.        It       s
[Pg 225]
just difference of method. In our country, a
similar honor would have been accorded with
a patrol wagon and a couple of policemen.       

After dinner, Duska insisted on dispatching a
cablegram which should intercept the City of
Rio at some point below the Isthmus. It was
not an original telegram, but, had Saxon received
it, it would have delighted him immoderately.
She said:

       I told you so. Sail by Orinoco.       

The following morning, there were tours of
discovery, personally conducted by the young
Mr. Partridge. Duska had wanted to leave
the carriage at the old cathedral, and stand flat
against the blank wall, but she refrained, and
satisfied herself with marching up very close
and regarding it with hostility. As the carriage
turned into the main plaza, a regiment
of infantry went by, the band marching ahead
playing, with the usual blare, the national anthem.
Then, as the coachman drew up his
horses at the legation door, there was sudden
confusion, followed by the noise of popping
guns. It was the hour just preceding the noon
siesta. The plaza was indolent with lounging
[Pg 226]
figures, and droning in the sleeping sing-song
chorus of lazy voices. At the sound, which for
the moment impressed the girl like the exploding
of a pack of giant crackers, a sudden stillness
fell on the place, closely followed by a
startled outcry of voices as the figures in the
plaza broke wildly for cover, futilely attempting
to shield their faces with their arms against
possible bullets. Then, there came a deeper detonation,
and somewhere the crumbling of an
adobe wall. The first sound came just as Mrs.
Horton was stepping to the sidewalk. Duska
had already leaped lightly out, and stood looking
on in surprise. But Mr. Partridge knew
his Puerto Frio. He led them hastily through
the huge street-doors, and they had no sooner
passed than the porter, with many mumbled
prayers to the Holy Mother, slammed the great
barriers against the outside world. The final
assault for Vegas y Libertad had at last begun.

Mr. Pendleton had insisted that the ladies remain
at the rear of the house, but Duska, with
her adventurous passion for seeing all there
was to see, threatened insubordination. To her,
[Pg 227]
the idea of leaving several perfectly good balconies
vacant, and staying at the back of a house,
when the only battle one would probably ever
see was occurring in the street just outside,
seemed far from sensible. But, after she had
looked out for a few moments, had seen a belated
fruit-vender crumple to the street, and
had smelled the acrid stench of the burnt powder,
she was willing to turn away.

Inasmuch as the stay of Duska and her aunt
involved several days of waiting for the sailing
of the next ship, Duska was somewhat surprised
at hearing nothing from Saxon in the meanwhile.
He had had time to reach the point to
which the cablegram was addressed. She had
told him she would sail by the Orinoco, since
that was the first available steamer. At such
a time, Saxon would certainly answer that message.
She fancied he would even manage to
join her steamer, either by coming down to
meet it, or waiting to intercept it at the place
where he had received her message. Consequently,
when she reached that port and sailed
again without either seeing Saxon or receiving
a message from him, she was decidedly
[Pg 228]
surprised, and, though she did not admit it even to
herself, she was likewise alarmed.

It happened that one of her fellow passengers
on the steamer Orinoco was a tall, grave
gentleman, who wore his beard trimmed in the
French fashion, and who in his bearing had a
certain air of distinction.

On a coast vessel, it was unusual for a passenger
to hold himself apart and reserved
against the chance companionships of a voyage.
Yet, this gentleman did so. He had been introduced
by the captain as M. Herv        , had
bowed and smiled, but since that he had not
sought to further the acquaintanceship, or to
recognize it except by a polite bow or smile
when he passed one of the party on his solitary
deck promenades.

Possibly, this perfunctory greeting would
have been the limit and confine of their associations,
had he not chanced to be standing one
day near enough to Duska and Steele to overhear
their conversation. The voyage was almost
ended, and New York was not far off.
Long ago, the lush rankness of the tropics had
given way to the more temperate beauty of the
[Pg 229]
higher zones, and this beauty was the beauty
of early autumn.

Steele was talking of Frederick Marston, and
the girl was listening with interest. As long as
Saxon insisted on remaining the first disciple, she
must of course be interested in his demi-god.
Just now, however, Saxon       s name was not mentioned.
Finally, the stranger turned, and came
over with a smile.

       When I hear the name of Frederick Marston,       
he said,        I am challenged to interest.
Would I be asking too much if I sought to join
you in your talk of him?       

The girl looked up and welcomed him with
her accustomed graciousness, while Steele drew
up a camp-stool, and the Frenchman seated himself.

For a while, he listened sitting there, his fingers
clasped about his somewhat stout knee,
and his face gravely speculative, contributing to
the conversation nothing except his attention.

       You see, I am interested in Marston,        he
at length began.

The girl hesitated. She had just been expressing
the opinion, possibly absorbed from
[Pg 230]
Saxon, that the personality of the artist was extremely
disagreeable. As she glanced at M.
Herv        , the thought flashed through her mind
that this might possibly be Marston himself.
She knew that master       s fondness for the incognito.
But she dismissed the idea as highly fanciful,
and even ventured frankly to repeat her
criticism.

At last, Herv         replied, with great gravity:

       Mademoiselle, I had the honor to know the
great Frederick Marston once. It was some
years ago. He keeps himself much as a hermit
might in these days, but I am sure that the
portion of the story I know is not that of the
vain man or of the poseur. Possibly,        he hesitated
modestly,        it might interest mademoiselle?       

       I       m sure of it,        declared the girl.

       Marston,        he began,        drifted into the
Paris ateliers from your country, callow, morbid,
painfully young and totally inexperienced.
He was a tall, gaunt boy with a beard that grew
hardly as fast as his career, though finally it
covered his face. Books and pictures he knew
with passionate love. With life, he was
[Pg 231]
unacquainted; at men, he looked distantly over the
deep chasm of his bashfulness. Women he
feared, and of them he knew no more than he
knew of dragons.

       He was eighteen then. He was in the
Salon at twenty-two, and at the height of fame
at twenty-six. He is now only thirty-three.
What he will be at forty, one can not surmise.       

The Frenchman gazed for a moment at the
spiraling smoke from his cigarette, and halted
with the uncertainty of a bard who doubts his
ability to do justice to his lay.

       I find the story difficult.        He smiled with
some diffidence, then continued:        Had I the art
to tell it, it would be pathos. Marston was a
generous fellow, beloved by those who knew
him, but quarantined by his morbid reserve
from wide acquaintanceship. Temperament       ah,
that is a wonderful thing! It is to a man
what clouds and mists are to a land! Without
them, there is only arid desert       with too many,
there are storm and endless rain and dreary
winds. He had the storms and rain and winds
in his life       but over all he had the genius! The
masters knew that before they had criticized
[Pg 232]
him six months. In a year, they stood abashed
before him.       

       Go on, please!        prompted Duska, in a soft
voice of sympathetic interest.

       He dreaded notoriety, he feared fame. He
never had a photograph taken, and, when it was
his turn to pose in the sketch classes, where the
students alternate as models for their fellows,
his nervousness was actual suffering. To be
looked at meant, for him, to drop his eyes and
find his hands in his way       the hands that could
paint the finest pictures in Europe!       

       To understand his half-mad conduct, one
must understand his half-mad genius. To most
men who can command fame, the plaudits of
clapping hands are as the incense of triumph.
To him, there was but the art itself       the praise
meant only embarrassment. His ideal was that
of the English poet       a land where



              only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame:
And no one shall work for money and no one shall work for fame.       



That was what he wished, and could not have
in Paris.

[Pg 233]
       It was in painting only that he forgot himself,
and became a disembodied magic behind a
brush. When a picture called down unusual
comment from critics and press, he would disappear       remain
out of sight for months. No
one knew where he went. Once, I remember,
in my time, he stayed away almost a year.

       He knew one woman in Paris, besides the
models, who were to him impersonal things.
Of that one woman alone, he was not afraid.
She was a pathetic sort of a girl. Her large
eyes followed him with adoring hero-worship.
She was the daughter of an English painter
who could not paint, one Alfred St. John, who
lodged in the rear of the floor above. She
herself was a poet who could not write verse.
To her, he talked without bashfulness, and for
her he felt vast sorrow. Love! Mon dieu, no!
If he had loved her, he would have fled from
her in terror!

       But she loved him. Then, he fell ill. Typhoid
it was, and for weeks he was in his bed,
with the papers crying out each day what a disaster
threatened France and the world, if he
should die. And she nursed him, denying
[Pg 234]
herself rest. Typhoid may be helped by a physician,
but the patient owes his life to the nurse.
When he recovered, his one obsessing thought
was that his life really belonged to her rather
than to himself. I have already said he was
morbid half to the point of madness. Genius
is sometimes so!

       By no means a constant absintheur, in
his moods he liked to watch the opalescent
gleams that flash in a glass of Pernod. One
night, when he had taken more perhaps than
was his custom, he returned to his lodgings, resolved
to pay the debt, with an offer of marriage.

       I do not know how much was the morbidness
of his own temperament, and how much
was the absinthe. I know that after that it was
all wormwood for them both.

       She was proud. She soon divined that he
had asked her solely out of sympathy, and perhaps
it was at her urging that he left Paris
alone. Perhaps, it was because his fame was becoming
too great to allow his remaining there
longer a recluse. At all events, he went away
without warning       fled precipitantly. No one
[Pg 235]
was astonished. His friends only laughed. For
a year they laughed, then they became a trifle
uneasy. Finally, however, these fears abated.
St. John, his father-in-law, admitted that he was
in constant correspondence with the master, and
knew where he was in hiding. He refused to
divulge his secret of place. He said that Marston
exacted this promise       that he wanted to
hide. Then came new pictures, which St. John
handled as his son-in-law       s agent. Paris delighted
in them. Marston travels about now,
and paints. Whether he is mildly mad, or only
as mad as his exaggerated genius makes him, I
have often wondered.       

       What became of the poor girl?        Duska       s
voice put the question, very tenderly.

       She, also, left Paris. Whether she let her
love conquer her pride and joined him, or
whether she went elsewhere       also alone, no one
knows but St. John, and he does not encourage
questions.       

       I hope,        said the girl slowly,        she went
back, and made him love her.       

Herv         caught the melting sympathy in
Duska       s eyes, and his own were responsive.

[Pg 236]
       If she did,        he said with conviction,        it
must have made the master happy. He gave
her what he could. He did not withhold his
heart from stint, but because it was so written.       
He paused, then in a lighter voice went on:

       And, speaking of Marston, one finds it impossible
to refrain from reciting an extraordinary
adventure that has just befallen his
first disciple, Mr. Saxon, who is a countryman
of yours.       

The girl       s eyes came suddenly away from the
sea to the face of the speaker, as he continued:

       I happened to be on the streets, when wiser
folk were in their homes, just after the battle
in Puerto Frio. I found Mr. Robert Saxon       perhaps
the second landscape painter in the
world       lying wounded on a pavement among
dead revolutionists, and I helped to carry him
to an insurrecto haunt. He was smuggled unconscious
on a ship sailing for some point in
my own land       Havre, I think. Allons! Life
plays pranks with men that make the fairy tales
seem feeble!       

Steele had been so astounded that he had
found no opportunity to stop the Frenchman.
[Pg 237]
Now, as he made a sign, M. Herv         looked at
the girl. She was sitting quite rigid in her
steamer chair, and her lips were white. Her
eyes were on his own, and were entirely steady.

       Will you tell us the whole story, M.
Herv        ?        she asked.

       Mon dieu! I have been indiscreet. I have
made a faux pas!       

The Frenchman       s distress was genuinely
deep.

       No,        answered the girl.        I must know all
the story. I thank you for telling me.       

As Herv         told his story, he realized that the
woman whom Saxon had turned back to warn,
according to Rodman       s sketching, was the
woman sitting before him on the deck of the
Orinoco.





[Pg 238]

CHAPTER XV


Captain Harris had been, like Rodman,
one of the men who make up the world       s flotsam
and jetsam. He, too, had meddled in the
affairs of that unstable belt which lies just above
and below the        line.        South and Central
American politics and methods were familiar
to him. He had not attained the command of
the tramp freighter Albatross without learning
one decisive lesson, that of eliminating curiosity
from his plan of living. He argued that
his passenger was an insurrecto, and, once seized
in Puerto Frio, could hardly hope to shield
himself behind American citizenship. There
had been many men in Puerto Frio when the
captain sailed who would have paid well for
passage to any port beyond the frontier, but to
have taken them might have brought complications.
He had been able at some risk to slip
two men at most to his vessel under the curtain
of night, and to clear without interference. He
had chosen the man who was his friend, Dr.
[Pg 239]
Cornish, and the man who was his countryman
and helpless. Of course, all the premises upon
which both Rodman and this sea-going man
acted were false premises. Had he been left,
Saxon would have been in no danger. He had
none the less been shanghaied for a voyage of
great length, and he had been shanghaied out
of sincere kindness.

It had not occurred to either the captain or
the physician that the situation could outlast
the voyage. The man had a fractured skull,
and he might die, or he might recover; but one
or the other he must do, and that presumably
before the completion of the trip across the
Atlantic. That he should remain in a comatose
state for days proved mildly surprising
and interesting to the physician, but that at
the end of this time he should suffer a long attack
of brain fever was an unexpected development.
Saxon knew nothing of his journeying,
and his only conversation was that of delirium.
He owed his life to the skill and vigilance of
the doctor, who had seen and treated human
ills under many crude conditions, and who devoted
himself with absorption to the case.
[Pg 240]
Neither the physician nor the captain knew
that the man had once been called Robert
Saxon. There was nothing to identify him.
He had come aboard in the riding clothes borrowed
from the lockers of the Phyllis, and his
pockets held only a rusty key, some American
gold and a little South American silver. Without
name or consciousness or baggage, he was
slowly crossing the Atlantic.

Other clothing was provided, and into the
newer pockets Captain Harris and Dr. Cornish
scrupulously transferred these articles. That
Carter, if he recovered, could reimburse the
skipper was never questioned. If he died, the
care given him would be charged to the account
of humanity, together with other services this
rough man had rendered in his diversified career.

Meanwhile, on the steamer Orinoco, the girl
was finding her clear, unflinching courage subjected
to the longest, fiercest siege of suspense,
and Steele tried in every possible manner to comfort
the afflicted girl in this time of her trial and
to alleviate matters with optimistic suggestions.
M. Herv         was in great distress over having
[Pg 241]
been the unwitting cause of fears which he
hoped the future would clear away. His aloofness
had ended, and, like Steele, he attached
himself to her personal following, and sought
with a hundred polite attentions to mitigate
what he regarded as suffering of his authorship.
Duska       s impulse had been to leave the vessel
at the first American port, but Steele had dissuaded
her. His plan was to wire to Kentucky
at the earliest possible moment, and learn
whether there had been any message from
Saxon. Failing in that, he advocated going on
to New York. If by any chance Saxon had
come back to the States; if, for example, he had
recovered en voyage and been transferred, as
was not impossible, to a west-bound vessel, his
agent in New York might have some tidings.

Herv         cursed himself for his failure to learn,
in the confused half-hour at the Puerto Frio
tavern, the name of the vessel that had taken
Saxon on board, or at least the name of the fellow
refugee who had befriended him.

When the ship came abreast of the fanglike
skyline of Manhattan Island, and was shouldered
against its pier at Brooklyn by swarming
[Pg 242]
tugs, the girl, although outwardly calm, was not
far from inward despair.

Steele       s first step was the effort to learn what
steamer it might have been that left Puerto
Frio for Venezuela and thence for France. But,
in the promiscuous fleets of rusty-hulled tramps
that beat their way about the world, following
a system hardly more fixed than the course of
a night-hawk cab about a city       s streets, the effort
met only failure.

The girl would not consent to an interval of
rest after her sea-voyage, but insisted on accompanying
Steele at once to the establishment of
the art dealer who had the handling of Saxon       s
pictures.

The dealer had seen Mr. Saxon some time
before as the artist passed through New York,
but since that time had received no word.
He had held a successful exhibition, and had
written several letters to the Kentucky address
furnished him, but to none of them had there
been a reply. The dealer was enthusiastic over
the art of the painter, and showed the visitors
a number of clippings and reviews that were
rather adulation than criticism.

[Pg 243]
The girl glanced at them impatiently. The
work was great, and she was proud of its praise,
but just now she was feeling that it really
meant nothing at all to her in comparison with
the painter himself. To her, he would have
been quite as important, she realized, had no
critic praised him; had his brush never forced
a compliment from the world. Her brow
gathered in perplexity over one paragraph that
met her eye.

       The most notable piece of work that has
yet come from this remarkable palette,        said
the critic,        is a canvas entitled,        Portrait of a
lady.        In this, Mr. Saxon has done something
more than approximate the genius of Frederick
Marston. He has seemed to carry it a point
forward, and one is led to believe that such an
effort may be the door through which the artist
shall issue from the distinction of being        Marston       s
first disciple        into a larger distinction
more absolutely his own.        There was more,
but the feature which caught her eye was the
fact stated that,        A gentleman bought this picture
for his private collection, refusing to give
his name.       

[Pg 244]
       What does it mean?        demanded Duska,
handing the clipping to Steele.        That picture
and the landscape from the Knob were not for
sale.       

The dealer was puzzled.

       Mr. Saxon,        he explained,        directed that
from this assignment two pictures were to be
reserved. They were designated by marks on
the back of the cases and the canvases. Neither
the portrait nor the landscape was so marked.       

       He must have made a mistake, in the hurry
of packing,        exclaimed the girl, in deep distress.
       He must have marked them wrong!       

       Who bought them?        demanded Steele.

The dealer shook his head.

       It was a gentleman, evidently an Englishman,
though he said he lived in Paris. He declined
to give his name, and paid cash. He
took the pictures with him in a cab to his hotel.
He did not even state where he was stopping.       
The dealer paused, then added:        He explained
to me that he collected for the love of pictures,
and that he found the notoriety attaching to
the purchase of famous paintings extremely
distasteful.       

[Pg 245]
       Have you ever seen this gentleman before?       
urged Steele.

       Yes,        the art agent answered reflectively,
       he has from time to time picked up several
of Mr. Saxon       s pictures, and his conversation
indicated that he was equally familiar with the
work of Marston himself. He said he knew
the Paris agent of Mr. Saxon quite well, and it
is possible that through that source you might
be able to locate him. I am very sorry the
mistake occurred, and, while I am positive that
you will find the letters        N.      F.      S.        (not for
sale) on the two pictures I have held, I shall do
all in my power to trace the lost ones.       

In one of the packing rooms, the suspicions of
Duska were corroborated. Two canvases were
found about the same shape and size as the two
that had been bought by the foreign art-lover.
Palpably, Saxon, in his hurry of boxing, had
wrongly labeled them.

In the flood of her despair, the girl found
room for a new pang. It was not only because
these pictures were the fulfillment of Saxon       s
most mature genius that their loss became a little
tragedy; not even merely because in them
[Pg 246]
she felt that she had in a measure triumphed
over Marston       s hold on the man she loved, but
because by every association that was important
to her and to him they were canonized.

That evening, Steele made his announcement.
He was going to Havre and Paris. If anything
could be learned at that end, he would
find it out, and while there he would trace the
pictures.

       You see,        he assured her, with a cheery
confidence he by no means felt,        it       s really
much simpler than it looks. He was hurt, and
he did not recover at once. By the time he
reaches France, the sea-voyage will have restored
him, and he will cable. Those tramp
steamers are slow, and he hasn       t yet had time.
If he takes a little longer to get well, I       ll be
there to look after him, and bring him home.       

The girl shook her head.

       You haven       t thought about the main thing,       
she said quickly, leaning forward and resting
her fingers lightly on his arm,        or perhaps you
thought of it, George dear, and were too kind
to speak of it. After this, he may wake up       he
may wake up the other man. I must go to
[Pg 247]
him myself. I must be with him.        Her voice
became eager and vibrant:        I want to be the
first living being he will greet.       

Steele found a thousand objections rising up
for utterance, but, as he looked at the steady
blue of her eyes, he left them all unsaid. She
had gone to South America, of course she would
go to France.


It would be imaginative flattery to call the
lodgings of Alfred St. John and his daughter
commodious, even with the added comforts that
the late years had brought to the alleviation of
their barrenness. The windows still looked out
over the dismal roofs of the Quartier Latin
and the frowning gray chimney pots where the
sparrows quarreled.

St. John might have moved to more commodious
quarters, for the days were no longer
as pinched as had been those of the past, yet
he remained in the house where he had lived
before his own ambition died.

His stock-in-trade was his agency in handling
the paintings of Frederick Marston, the half-mad
painter who, since he had left Paris shortly
[Pg 248]
after his marriage, had not returned to his ancient
haunts, or had any parcel in the life of
the art world that idolized him, except as he
was represented by this ambassador.

St. John sold the pictures that the painter,
traveling about, presumably concealing himself
under assumed names, sent back to the waiting
market and the eager critics.

And St. John knew that, inasmuch as he had
been poor, in the half-starved, hungry way of
being poor, now his commissions clothed him
and paid for his claret, and, above all, made it
possible for him to indulge the one soul he
loved with the simple comforts that softened
her suffering.

The daughter of St. John required some
small luxuries which it delighted the Englishman
to give her. He had been proud when she
married Frederick Marston, he had been distressed
when the marriage proved a thing of
bitterness, and during the past years he had
watched her grow thin, and had feared at first,
and known later, that she had fallen prey to the
tubercular troubles which had caused her mother       s
death.

[Pg 249]
St. John had been a petty sort, and had not
withstood the whisperings of dishonest motives.
Paradoxically his admiration for Frederick
Marston was, seemingly at least, wholly sincere.

In this hero-worship for the painter, who
had failed as a husband to make his daughter
happy, there was no disloyalty for the
daughter. He knew that Marston had given all
but the love he had not been able to give and
that he had simulated this until her own insight
pierced the deception, refusing compassion
where she demanded love.

The men who rendered unto Marston their
enthusiastic admiration were men of a cult, and
tinged with a sort of cult fanaticism. St. John,
as father-in-law, agent and correspondent, was
enabled to pose along the Boulevard St. Michel
as something of a high priest, and in this small
vanity he gloried. So, when the questioners of
the caf        s bombarded him with inquiries as to
when Marston would tire of his pose of hermit
and return to Paris, the British father-in-law
would throw out his shallow chest, and allow
an enigmatical smile to play in his pale eyes,
[Pg 250]
and a faint uplift to come to the corners of his
thin lips, but he never told.

       I have a letter here,        he would say, tapping
the pocket of his coat.        The master is
well, and says that he feels his art to be broadening.       

Between the man and his daughter, the subject
of the painter was never mentioned. After
her return from England, where she had spent
the first year after Marston dropped out of her
life, she had exacted from her father a promise
that his name should not be spoken between
them, and the one law St. John never transgressed
was that of devotion to her.

Her life was spent in the lodgings, to which
St. John clung because they were in the building
where Marston had painted. She never suggested
a removal to more commodious quarters.
Possibly, into her pallid life had crept a
sentimental fondness for the place for the same
reason. Her weakness was growing into
feebleness. Less, each day, she felt like going
down the steep flights of stairs for a walk in
the Boulevard of St. Michael, and climbing
[Pg 251]
them again on her return. More heavily each
day, she leaned on his supporting arm. All
these things St. John noted, and day by day the
traces of sandy red in his mustache and beard
faded more and more into gray, and the furrow
between his pale blue eyes deepened more perceptibly.

St. John had gone one afternoon to a neighboring
atelier, and the girl, wandering into his
room, saw a portrait standing on the easel
which St. John had formerly used for his own
canvases. Most of the pictures that came here
were Marston       s. This one, like the rest, was
unsigned. She sank into the deeply cushioned
chair that St. John kept for her in his own
apartment, and gazed fixedly at the portrait.

It was a picture of a woman, and the woman
in the chair smiled at the woman on the canvas.

       You are very beautiful       my successor!       
she murmured. For a time, she studied the
warm, vivid tones of the painted features, then,
with the same smile, devoid of bitterness, she
went on talking to the other face.

       I know you are my successor,        she said,
[Pg 252]
       because the enthusiasm painted into your face
is not the enthusiasm of art alone       nor,        she
added slowly,        is it pity!       

Then, she noticed that one corner of the canvas
caught the light with the shimmer of wet
paint. It was the corner where ordinarily an
artist affixes his name. She rose and went to
the heavy studio-easel, and looked again with
her eyes close to the stretchers. The paint was
evidently freshly applied to that corner of the
canvas. To her peering gaze, it almost seemed
that through the new coating of the background
she could catch a faint underlying line of red,
as though it had been a stroke in the letter of a
name. Then, she noticed her father       s palette
lying on a chair near the easel, and the brushes
were damp. The lake and Van Dyke brown
and neutral-tint that had been squeezed from
their tubes were mixed into a rich tone on the
palette, which matched the background of the
portrait. Sinking back in the chair, fatigued
even by such a slight exertion, she heard her
father       s returning tread on the stairs.

From the door, he saw her eyes on the picture,
but true to his promise he remained silent,
[Pg 253]
though, as he caught her gaze on the palette, his
own eyes took on something of anxiety and
foreboding.

       Does he sign his pictures now?        she asked
abruptly.

       No. Why?       

       It looked       almost,        she said wearily,        as
though the signature had been painted out there
at the corner.       

For an instant, St. John eyed his daughter
with keen intentness.

       The canvas was scraped in shipping,        he
said, at last.        I touched up the spot where the
paint was rubbed.       

For a time, both were silent. The father saw
that two hectic spots glowed on the girl       s bloodless
cheeks, and that her eyes, fixed on the picture,
wore a deeply wistful longing.

He, too, knew that this picture was a declaration
of love, that in her silence she was torturing
herself with the thought that these other
eyes had stirred the heart that had remained
closed to her. He did not want to admit to
her that this was not a genuine Marston; yet, he
faltered a moment, and resolved that he could
[Pg 254]
not, even for so necessary a deception, let her
suffer.

       That portrait, my child,        he confessed
slowly,        was not painted by       by him. It       s
by another artist, a lesser man, named Saxon.       

Into the deep-set eyes surged a look of incredulous,
but vast, relief. The frail shoulders
drew back from their shallow-chested sag, and
the thin lips smiled.

       Doesn       t he sign his pictures, either?        she
demanded, finally.

For an instant, St. John hesitated awkwardly
for an explanation.

       Yes,        he said at last, a little lamely.        This
canvas was cut down for framing, and the signature
was thrown so close to the edge that the
frame conceals the name.        He paused, then
added, quietly:        I have kept my promise of
silence, but now       do you want to hear of him?       

She looked up       then shook her head, resolutely.

       No,        she said.





[Pg 255]

CHAPTER XVI


Late one evening in the caf         beneath the
Elys        e Palace H       tel, a tall man of something
like thirty-five, though aged to the seeming of
a bit more, sat over his brandy and soda and the
perusal of a packet of letters. He wore traveling
dress, and, though the weather had hardly
the bitterness to warrant it, a fur-trimmed great-coat
fell across the empty chair at his side. It
was not yet late enough for the gayety that begins
with midnight, and the place was consequently
uncrowded. The stranger had left a
taxicab at the door a few minutes before, and,
without following his luggage into the office, he
had gone directly to the caf        , to glance over
his mail before being assigned to a room.

The man was tall and almost lean. Had
Steele entered the caf         at that moment, he
would have rushed over to the seated figure, and
grasped a hand with a feeling that his quest
had ended, then, on second sight, he would have
drawn back, incredulous and mystified. This
[Pg 256]
guest lacked no feature that Robert Saxon
possessed. His eyes held the same trace of the
dreamer, though a close scrutiny showed also a
hard glitter       his dreams were different. The
hand that held the letter was marked front and
back, though a narrow inspection would have
shown the scar to be a bit more aggravated,
more marked with streaked wrinkles about the
palm. He and the American painter were as
identical as models struck from one die in the
lines and angles that make face and figure. Yet,
in this man, there was something foreign and
alien to Saxon, a difference of soul-texture.
Saxon was a being of flesh, this man a statue of
chilled steel.

The envelope he had just cast upon the table
fell face upward, and the waiting gar        on could
hardly help observing that it was addressed to
Se        or George Carter, care of a steamship
agency in the Rue Scribe.

As Carter read the letter it had contained,
his brows gathered first in great interest, then
in surprise, then in greater interest and greater
surprise.

       There has been a most strange occurrence
[Pg 257]
here,        said the writer, who dated his communication
from Puerto Frio, and wrote in Spanish.
       Just before the revolution broke, a man arrived
who was called Robert A. Saxon. He
was obviously mistaken for you by the government
and was taken into custody, but released
on the interference of his minister. The likeness
was so remarkable that I was myself deceived
and consequently astounded you should
make so bold as to return. He, however, established
a clean bill of health and that very
fact has suggested to me an idea which I think
will likewise commend itself to you, amigo mio.
That I am speaking only from my sincere interest
in you, you need not question when you
consider that I have kept you advised through
these years of matters here and have divulged
to no soul your whereabouts. This man left at
once, but the talk spread rapidly in confidential
circles than an Americano had come who was
the double of yourself. Some men even contended
that it was really you, and that it was
you also who betrayed the plans of Vegas to
the government, but that scandal is not credited.
Most of those who are well informed
[Pg 258]
know that the traitor was one whom we trusted,
a man who in your day was on the side of the
established government. That man is now in
high influence by reason of playing the Judas,
and it may be that he will make an effort to
secure your extradition. Embezzlement, you
know, is not a political offense, and he still
holds a score against you. You know to whom
I refer. That is why I warn you. You have
a double and your double has a clean record.
For a time if there is no danger of crossing
tracks with him, I should advise that you be
Se        or Saxon instead of Se        or Carter. This
should be safe enough since Se        or Saxon sailed
on the day after his arrival for North America.
I have the felicity to inscribe myself,        etc.,
etc.                          A dash served as a signature, but
Carter knew the writing, and was satisfied. For
a time, he sat in deep reverie, then, rising, took
up his coat, and went to the door. His stride
was precisely the stride of Robert Saxon.

At the desk above, he discussed apartments.
Having found one that suited his taste, he signed
the guest-card with the name of Robert Saxon,
and inquired as to the hour of departure of
[Pg 259]
trains for Calais on the following morning. He
volunteered the information that he was leaving
then for London. True to his word, on the
next day he left the hotel in a taximeter cab
which turned down the Champs Elys        es.


When it was definitely settled that Duska and
her aunt were to go to Europe, Steele conceived
a modification of the plans, to which only after
much argument and persuasion and even a
touch of deception he won the girl       s consent.
The object of his amendment was secretly to
give him a chance to arrive first on the scene,
accomplish what he could of search, and be prepared
with fore-knowledge to stand as a buffer
between Duska and the first shock of any ill tidings.
Despite his persistent optimism of argument,
the man was far from confident. The
plan was that the two ladies should embark for
Genoa, and go from there to Paris by rail, while
he should economize days by hurrying over the
northern ocean track. Duska chafed at the delay
involved, but Steele found ingenious arguments.
The tramp steamer, he declared, with
its roundabout course, would be slow, and it
[Pg 260]
would be better for him to be armed against
their coming with such facts as he could gather,
in order that he might be a more effective guide.

Possibly, he argued, the tramp ship had gone
by way of the Madeiras, and might soon be in
the harbor of Funchal. If she took the southerly
track, she could go at once by a steamer
that would give her a day there, and, armed
with letters he would send to the consulate, this
contingency could be probed, leaving him free
to work at the other end. If he learned anything
first, she would learn of it at once by wireless.

So, at last, he stood on a North River pier,
and saw the girl waving her good-by across the
rail, until the gap of churning water had
widened and blurred the faces on the deck.
Then, he turned and hastened to make his own
final arrangements for sailing by the Mauretania
on the following day.

In Havre, he found himself utterly baffled.
He haunted the water-front, and browbeat the
agents, all to no successful end.

In Paris, matters seemed to bode no better
results. He first exhausted the more probable
[Pg 261]
points. Saxon       s agent, the commissaire de
police, the consulate, the hospitals       he even
made a melancholy visit to the grewsome building
where the morgue squats behind N       tre
Dame. Then he began the almost endless round
of hotels. His        taxi        sped about through
the swift, seemingly fluid currents of traffic, as a
man in a hurry can go only in Paris, the frictionless.
The town was familiar to him in
most of its aspects, and he was able to work with
the readiness and certainty of one operating in
accustomed haunts, commanding the tongue
and the methods. At last, he learned of the
registry at the Elys        e Palace H       tel. He questioned
the clerk, and that functionary readily
enough gave him the description of the gentleman
who had so inscribed himself. It was a
description of the man he sought. Steele fell
into one grave error. He did not ask to see
the signature itself.        Where had Monsieur
Saxon gone? To London. Certainment, he
had taken all his luggage with him. No, he
had not spoken of returning to Paris. Yes,
monsieur seemed in excellent health.       

So, Steele turned his search to London, and in
[Pg 262]
London found himself even more hopelessly
mixed in baffling perplexity. He had learned
only one thing, and that one thing filled him
with vague alarm. Saxon had apparently been
here. He had been to all seeming sane and
well, and had given his own name. His conduct
was inexplicable. It was inconceivable that he
should have failed to communicate with Duska.
Steele cabled to America, thinking Saxon might
have done so since their departure. Nothing
had been heard at home.

Late in the afternoon on the day of his arrival
in London, Steele went for a walk, hoping
that before he returned some clew would occur
to him, upon which he could concentrate his
efforts. His steps wandered aimlessly along
Pall Mall, and, after the usage of former habit,
carried him to a club, where past experience
told him he would meet old friends. But, at
the club door, he halted, realizing that he did
not want to meet men. He could think better
alone. So, with his foot on the stone stairs, he
wheeled abruptly, and went on to Trafalgar
Square, where once more he halted, under the
lions of the Nelson Column, and racked his
[Pg 263]
brain for any thought or hint that might be followed
to a definite end.

He stood with the perplexed air of a man
without definite objective. The square was
well-nigh empty except for a few loiterers about
the basins, and the view was clear to the elevation
on the side where, at the cab-stand, waited
a row of motor        taxis        and hansoms. The
afternoon was bleak, and the solemn monotone
of London was graver and more forbidding
than usual.

Suddenly, his heart pounded with a violence
that made his chest feel like a drum. With a
sudden start, he called loudly,        Saxon! Hold
on, Saxon!        then went at a run toward the cab-stand.

He had caught a fleeting and astounding vision.
A man, with the poise and face that he
sought, had just stepped into one of the waiting
vehicles, and given an order to the driver. Even
in his haste, Steele was too late to do anything
more than take a second cab, and shout to the
man on the box to follow the vehicle that
had just left the curb. As his        taxi        turned
into the Strand, and slurred through the mud
[Pg 264]
past the Cecil and the Savoy, he kept his eyes
strained on the cab ahead, threading its way
through the congested traffic, disappearing,
dodging, reappearing, and taxing his gaze to
the utmost. For a moment after they had both
crowded into Fleet Street, he lost it, and, as he
leaned forward, searching the jumble of traffic,
his own vehicle came to a halt just opposite
the Law Courts. He looked hastily out, to
see the familiar shoulders of the man he followed
disappearing beyond a street-door, under
the swinging        Sign of the Cock.       

Tossing a half-crown to the cabman, he followed
up the stairs, and entered the room,
where the tables were almost deserted. A
group of men was sitting in one of the stalls,
deep in converse, and, though two were hidden
by the dividing partitions, Steele saw the one
figure he sought at the head of the table. The
figure bent forward in conversation, and, while
his voice was low and his words inaudible, the
Kentuckian saw that the eyes were glittering
with a hard, almost malevolent keenness. As he
came hastily forward, he caught the voice: it was
Saxon       s voice, yet infinitely harder. The two
[Pg 265]
companions were strangers of foreign aspect,
and they were listening attentively, though one
face wore a sullen scowl.

Steele came over, and dropped his hand on
the shoulder of the man he had pursued.

       Bob!        he exclaimed, then halted.

The three faces looked up simultaneously,
and in all was displeasure for the abrupt interruption
of a conversation evidently intended for
no outside ears. Each expression was blank
and devoid of recognition, and, as the tall man
rose to his feet, his face was blanker than the
others.

Then, with the greater leisure for scrutiny,
Steele realized his mistake. For a time, he
stood dumfounded at the marvelous resemblance.
He knew without asking that this man
was the double who had brought such a tangle
into his friend       s life. He bowed coldly.

       I apologize,        he explained, shortly.        I mistook
this gentleman for someone else.       

The three men inclined their heads stiffly, and
the Kentuckian, dejected by his sudden reverse
from apparent success to failure, turned on his
heel, and left the place. It had not, of course,
[Pg 266]
occurred to him to connect the appearance of his
snarler of Saxon       s affairs with the name on the
Paris hotel-list, and he was left more baffled
than if he had known only the truth, in that he
had been thrown upon a false trail.

The Kentuckian joined Mrs. Horton and her
niece in Genoa on their arrival. As he met the
hunger in the girl       s questioning eyes, his heart
sickened at the meagerness of his news. He
could only say that Paris had divulged nothing,
and that a trip to London had been equally
fruitless of result. He did not mention the fact
that Saxon had registered at the hotel. That
detail he wished to spare her.

She listened to his report, and at its end said
only,        Thank you,        but he knew that something
must be done. A woman who could let herself
be storm-tossed by grief might ride safely out
of such an affair when the tempest had beaten
itself out, but she, who merely smiled more
sadly, would not have even the relief that comes
of surrender to tears.

At Milan, there was a wait of several hours.
Steele insisted on the girl       s going with him for
a drive. At a picture-exhibition, they stopped.

[Pg 267]
       Somehow,        said Steele,        I feel that where
there are paintings there may be clews. Shall
we go in?       

The girl listlessly assented, and they entered
a gallery, which they found already well filled.
Steele was the artist, and, once in the presence
of great pictures, he must gnaw his way along
a gallery wall as a rat gnaws its way through
cheese, devouring as he went, seeing only that
which was directly before him. The girl       s eyes
ranged more restlessly.

Suddenly, Steele felt her clutch his arm.

       George!        she breathed in a tense whisper.
       George!       

He followed her impulsively pointed finger,
and further along, as the crowd of spectators
opened, he saw, smiling from a frame on the
wall, the eyes and lips of the girl herself. Under
the well-arranged lights, the figure stood
out as though it would leave its fixed place on
the canvas and mingle with the human beings
below, hardly more lifelike than itself.

       The portrait!        exclaimed Steele, breathlessly.
       Come, Duska; that may develop something.       

[Pg 268]
As they anxiously approached, they saw above
the portrait another familiar canvas; a landscape
presenting a stretch of valley and checkered
flat, with hills beyond, and a sky tuneful
with the spirit of a Kentucky June.

Then, as they came near enough to read the
labels, Steele drew back, startled, and his brows
darkened with anger.

       My God!        he breathed.

The girl standing at his elbow read on a
brass tablet under each frame,        Frederick
Marston, pnxt.       

       What does it mean?        she indignantly demanded,
looking at the man whose face had become
rigid and unreadable.

       It means they have stolen his pictures!        he
replied, shortly.        It means infamous thievery
at least, and I       m afraid               In his anger and
surprise, he had almost forgotten to whom he
was speaking. Now, with realization, he bit
off his utterance.

She was standing very straight.

       You needn       t be afraid to tell me,        she said
quietly;        I want to know.       

       I       m afraid,        said Steele,        it means foul
[Pg 269]
play. Of course,        he added in a moment,
       Marston himself is not a party to the fraud.
It       s conceivable that his agent, this man St.
John, has done this in Marston       s absence. I
must get to Paris and see.       





[Pg 270]

CHAPTER XVII


In the compartment of the railway carriage,
Steele was gazing fixedly at the lace
       tidy        on the cushioned back of the opposite
seat. His brows were closely knit in thought.
He was evolving a plan.

Duska sat with her elbow on the sill of the
compartment window, her chin on her gloved
hand, her eyes gazing out, vague and unseeing.
Yet, she loved beauty, and just outside the panes
there was beauty drawn to a scale of grandeur.

They were climbing, behind the double-header
of engines, up where it seemed that one
could reach out and touch the close-hanging
clouds, into tunnels and out of tunnels, through
St. Gothard       s Pass and on where the Swiss
Alps reached up into the fog that veiled
the summits. The mountain torrents came
roaring down, to beat their green water into
swirling foam, and dash over the lower rocks
like frenzied mill-races. Her eyes did not
[Pg 271]
wake to a sparkle at sight of the quaint ch       lets
which seemed to stagger under huge roof slabs
of rugged slate. She did not even notice how
they perched high on seemingly unattainable
crags like stranded arks on Helvetian Ararats.

Each tunnel was the darkness between
changed tableaux, and the mouth of each offered
a new and more wonderful picture. The car-windows
framed glimpses of Lake Como, Lake
Lugano, and valleys far beneath where villages
were only a jumble of toy blocks; yet, all these
things did not change the utter weariness of
Duska       s eyes where enthusiasm usually dwelt,
or tempt Steele       s fixity of gaze from the lace
       tidy.       

At Lucerne, his thinking found expression in
a lengthy telegram to Paris. The Milan exhibit
had opened up a new channel for speculation.
If Saxon       s pictures were being pirated
and sold as Marston       s, there was no one upon
whom suspicion would fall more naturally than
the unscrupulous St. John, Marston       s factor in
Paris. Steele vaguely remembered the Englishman
with his petty pride for his stewardship,
[Pg 272]
though his own art life had lain in circles that
rarely intercepted that of the Marston cult even
at its outer rim. If this fraud were being practiced,
its author was probably swindling both
artists, and the appearance of either of them in
Paris might drive St. John to desperate means
of self-protection.

The conversion of the rooms formerly occupied
by Marston into a school had been St.
John       s doing. This atelier was in the house
where St. John himself lived, and the Kentuckian
knew that, unless he had moved his lodgings,
he could still be found there, as could the
very minor        academy        of Marston-idolizers,
with their none-too-exalted instructor, Jean
Hautecoeur.

At all events, it was to this address that Steele
directed his message. Its purport was to inform
St. John that Americans, who had only a
short stay in Paris, were anxious to procure a
Marston of late date, and to summon him to
the H       tel Palais d       Orsay for the day of their
arrival there.

When they reached the hotel, he told the girl
of his plan, suggesting that it might be best for
[Pg 273]
him to have this interview with the agent alone,
but admitting that, if she insisted on being present,
it was her right. She elected to hear the
conversation, and, when St. John arrived, he
was conducted to the sitting-room of Mrs. Horton       s
suite.

Pleased with the prospect of remunerative
sales, Marston       s agent made his entrance jauntily.
The shabbiness of the old days had been
put by. He was now sprucely clothed, and in
his lapel he wore a bunch of violets.

His thin, dissipated face was adorned with
a rakishly trimmed mustache and Vandyke of
gray which still held a fading trace of its erstwhile
sandy red. His eyes were pale and restless
as he stood bowing at the door. The
afternoon was waning, and the lights had not
yet been turned on.

       Mr. Steele?        he inquired.

Steele nodded.

St. John looked expectantly toward the girl
in the shadow, as though awaiting an introduction,
which was not forthcoming. As he looked,
he seemed to grow suddenly nervous and ill-at-ease.

[Pg 274]
       You are Mr. Marston       s agent, I believe?       
Steele spoke crisply.

       I have had that honor since Mr. Marston
left Paris some years ago. You know, doubtless,
that the master spends his time in foreign
travel.        The agent spoke with a touch of self-importance.

       I want you to deliver to me here the portrait
and the landscape now on exhibition at
Milan,        ordered the American.

       It will be difficult       perhaps expensive       but
I think it may be possible.        St. John spoke
dubiously.

Steele       s eyes narrowed.

       I am not requesting,        he announced,        I am
ordering.       

       But those canvases, my dear sir, represent
the highest note of a master       s work!        began
St. John, almost indignantly.        They are the
perfection of the art of the greatest living
painter, and you direct me to procure them as
though they were a grocer       s staple on a shelf!
Already, they are as good as sold. One does
not have to peddle Marston       s canvases!       

Steele walked over to the door, and, planting
[Pg 275]
his back against its panels, folded his arms.
His voice was deliberate and dangerous:

       It       s not worth while to bandy lies with you.
We both know that those pictures are from the
brush of Robert Saxon. We both know that
you have bought them at the price of a pupil       s
work, and mean to sell them at the price of the
master       s. I shall be in a position to prove the
swindle, and to hand you over to the courts.       

St. John had at the first words stiffened with
a sudden flaring of British wrath under his gray
brows. As he listened, the red flush of anger
faded to the coward       s pallor.

       That is not all,        went on Steele.        We
both know that Mr. Saxon came to Paris a
short while ago. For him to learn the truth
meant your unmasking. He disappeared. We
both know whose interests were served by that
disappearance. You will produce those canvases,
and you will produce Mr. Saxon within
twenty-four hours, or you will face not only exposure
for art-piracy, but prosecution for what
is more serious.       

As he listened, St. John       s face betrayed not
only fear, but also a slowly dawning wonder
[Pg 276]
that dilated his vague pupils. Steele, keenly
reading the face, as he talked, knew that the
surprise was genuine.

       As God is my witness,        avowed the Englishman,
earnestly,        if Mr. Saxon is in Paris,
or in Europe, I know nothing of it.       

       That,        observed Steele dryly,        will be a
matter for you to prove.       

       No, no!        The Englishman       s voice was
charged with genuine terror, and the hand that
he raised in pleading protest trembled. His
carefully counterfeited sprightliness of guise
dropped away, and left him an old man, much
broken.

       I will tell you the whole story,        he went
on.        It       s a miserable enough tale without imputing
such evil motives as you suggest. It       s
a shameful confession, and I shall hold back
nothing. The pictures you saw are Saxon       s
pictures. Of course, I knew that. Of course,
I bought them at what his canvases would bring
with the intention of selling them at the
greater price commanded by the greater painter.
I knew that the copyist had surpassed the master,
but the world did not know. I knew that
[Pg 277]
Europe would never admit that possible. I
knew that, if once I palmed off this imitation
as genuine, all the art-world would laugh to
scorn the man who announced the fraud. Mr.
Saxon himself could not hope to persuade the
critics that he had done those pictures, once
they were accepted as Marston       s. The art-world
is led like sheep. It believes there is
one Marston, and that no other can counterfeit
him. And I knew that Marston himself
could not expose me, because I know that
Marston is dead.        The man was ripping out
his story in labored, detached sentences.

Steele looked up with astonished eyes. The
girl sat listening, with her lips parted.

       You see               the Englishman       s voice was impassioned
in its bitterness              I am not shielding
myself. I am giving you the unrelieved
truth. When I determined the fact of his
death, I devised a scheme. I did not at that
time know that this American would be able
to paint pictures that could be mistaken for
Marston       s. Had I known it, I should have endeavored
to ascertain if he would share the
scheme with me. Collaborating in the fraud,
[Pg 278]
we could have levied fortunes from the art
world, whereas in his own name he must have
painted a decade more to win the verdict of
his true greatness. I was Marston       s agent. I
am Marston       s father-in-law. When I speak, it
is as his ambassador. Men believe me. My
daughter               the man       s voice broke              my
daughter lies on her death-bed. For her, there
are a few months, perhaps only a few weeks,
left of life. I have provided for her by trading
on the name and greatness of her husband.
If you turn me over to the police, you will kill
her. For myself, it would be just, but I am
not guilty of harming Mr. Saxon, and she is
guilty of nothing.        The narrator halted in his
story, and covered his face with his talon-like
fingers. St. John was not a strong man. The
metal of his soul was soft and without temper.
He dropped into a chair, and for a while, as
his auditors waited in silence, gave way to his
emotion.

       I tell you,        he groaned,        I have at least
been true to one thing in life. I have loved
my child. I don       t want her punished for my
offenses.       

[Pg 279]
Suddenly, he rose and faced the girl.

       I don       t know you,        he said passionately,
       but I am an old man. I am an outcast       a
derelict! I was not held fit for an introduction,
but I appeal to you. Life can drive a
man to anything. Life has driven me to most
things, but not to all. I knew that any day
might bring my exposure. If it had come after
my daughter       s death, I would have been satisfied.
I have for months been watching her die       wanting
her to live, yet knowing that her
death and my disgrace were racing together.       
He paused, then added in a quaking voice:
       There were days when I might have been
introduced to a woman like you, many years
ago.       

Duska was not fitted by nature to officiate
at        third degree        proceedings. As she looked
back into the beseeching face, she saw only that
it was the face of an old man, broken and terrified,
and that even through its gray terror it
showed the love of which he talked.

Her hand fell gently on his shoulder.

       I am sorry       about your daughter,        she
said, softly.

[Pg 280]
St. John straightened, and spoke more steadily.

       The story is not ended. In those days, it
was almost starvation. No one would buy
my pictures. No one would buy her verse.
The one source of revenue we might have
had was what Marston sought to give us, but
that she would not accept. She said she had
not married him for alimony. He tried often
and in many ways, but she refused. Then,
he left. He had done that before. No one
wondered. After his absence had run to two
years, I was in Spain, and stumbled on a
house, a sort of pension, near Granada, where
he had been painting under an assumed name,
as was his custom. Then, he had gone again       no
one knew where. But he had left behind
him a great stack of finished canvases. Mon
dieu, how feverishly the man must have
worked during those months       for he had then
been away from the place almost a year. The
woman who owned the house did not know the
value of the pictures. She only knew that he
had ordered his rooms reserved, and had not
returned, and that rental and storage were due
[Pg 281]
her. I paid the charges, and took the pictures.
Then, I investigated. My investigations proved
that my surmise as to his death was correct.
I was cautious in disposing of the pictures.
They were like the diamonds of Kimberley, too
precious to throw upon the market in sufficient
numbers to glut the art-appetite of the world.
I hoarded them. I let them go one or two at
a time, or in small consignments. He had always
sold his pictures cheaply. I was afraid
to raise the price too suddenly. From time to
time, I pretended to receive letters from the
painter. I had then no definite plan. When
they had reached the highest point of fame and
value, I would announce his death. But, meanwhile,
I discovered the work young Saxon was
doing in America. I followed his development,
and I hesitated to announce the death of Marston.
An idea began to dawn on me in a nebulous
sort of way, that somehow this man       s work
might be profitably utilized by substitution. At
first, it was very foggy       my idea       but I felt
that in it was a possibility, at all events enough
to be thought over       and so I did not announce
the death of Marston. Then, I realized that
[Pg 282]
I could supplement the Marston supply with
these canvases. I was timid. Such sales must
be cautiously made, and solely to private individuals
who would remove the pictures from
public view. At last, I found these two
which you saw at Milan. I felt that Mr.
Saxon could never improve them. I would
take the chance, even though I had to exhibit
them publicly. The last of the Marstons, save
a few, had been sold. I could realize enough
from these to take my daughter to Cairo, where
she might have a chance to live. I bought the
canvases in New York in person. They have
never been publicly shown save in Milan; they
were there but for a day only, and were not to
be photographed. When you sent for me, I
thought it was an American Croesus, and that
I had succeeded.        St. John had talked rapidly
and with agitation. Now, as he paused, he
wiped the moisture from his forehead with his
pocket-handkerchief.

       I have planned the thing with the utmost
care. I have had no confederates. I even collected
a few of Mr. Saxon       s earlier and less
effective pictures, and exhibited them beside
[Pg 283]
Marston       s best, so the public might compare
and be convinced in its idea that the
boundary between the master and the follower
was the boundary between the sublime and the
merely meritorious. That is all. For a
year I have hesitated. When I entered this
room, I realized my danger. Even in the growing
twilight, I recognized the lady as the original
of the portrait.       

       But didn       t you know,        questioned the girl,
       that sooner or later the facts must become
known       that at any time Mr. Saxon might
come to Europe, and see one of his own pictures
as I saw the portrait of myself in Milan?       

St. John bowed his head.

       I was desperate enough to take that
chance,        he answered,        though I safeguarded
myself in many ways. My sales would invariably
be to purchasers who would take their pictures
to private galleries. I should only have
to dispose of a few at a time. Mr. Saxon
has sold many pictures in Paris under his own
name, and does not know who bought them.
Selling them as Marston       s, though somewhat
more complicated, might go on for some time       and
[Pg 284]
my daughter       s life can not last long.
After that, nothing matters.       

       Have you actually sold any Saxons as
Marstons heretofore?        demanded Steele.

St. John hesitated for a moment, and then
nodded his head.

       Possibly, a half-dozen,        he acknowledged,
       to private collectors, where I felt it was safe.       

       I have no wish to be severe,        Steele spoke
quietly,        but those two pictures we must have.
I will pay you a fair profit. For the time, at
least, the matter shall go no further.       

St. John bowed with deep gratitude.

       They shall be delivered,        he said.

Steele stood watching St. John bow himself
out, all the bravado turned to obsequiousness.
Then, the Kentuckian shook his head.

       We have unearthed that conspiracy,        he
said,        but we have learned nothing. To-morrow,
I shall visit the studio where the Marston
enthusiasts work, and see if there is anything to
be learned there.       

       And I shall go with you,        the girl promptly
declared.





[Pg 285]

CHAPTER XVIII


On an unimportant cross street which cuts
at right angles the Boulevard St. Michel, that
axis of art-student Paris, stands an old and
somewhat dilapidated house, built, after the
same fashion as all its neighbors, about a court,
and entered by a door over which the concierge
presides. This house has had other years in
which it stood pretentious, with the pride of a
mansion, among its peers. Now, its splendor
is tarnished, its respectability is faded, and the
face it presents to the street wears the gloom
that comes of past glory, heightened, perhaps,
by the dark-spiritedness of many tenants who
have failed to enroll their names among the
great.

Yet, for all its forbidding frown, its front
bespeaks a certain consciousness of lingering
dignity. A plate, set in the door-case, announces
that the great Marston painted here a
few scant years ago, and here still that more-or-less-distinguished
instructor, Jean Hautecoeur,
[Pg 286]
tells his pupils in the second-floor atelier
how it was done.

He was telling them now. The model, who
had been posed as,        Aphrodite Rising from
the Foam,        was resting. She sat on the dilapidated
throne amid a circle of easels. A
blanket was thrown about her, from the folds
of which protruded a bare and shapely arm,
the hand holding lightly between two fingers
the cigarette with which she beguiled her recess.

The master, looking about on the many industrious,
if not intellectual, faces, was discoursing
on Marston       s feeling for values.

       He did not learn it,        declared M. Hautecoeur:
       he was born with it. He did not acquire
it: he evolved it. A faulty value
caused him pain as a false note causes pain to
the true musician.        Then, realizing that this
was dangerous doctrine from the lips of one
who was endeavoring to instill the quality into
others, born with less gifted natures, he hastened
to amend.        Yet, other masters, less
facile, have gained by study what they lacked
by heritage.       

[Pg 287]
The room was bare except for its accessories
of art. A few well-chosen casts hung about
the walls. Many unmounted canvases were
stacked in the corners, the floors were chalk-marked
where easel-positions had been recorded;
charcoal fragments crunched underfoot
when one walked across the boards. From
the sky-light       for the right of the building had
only two floors       fell a flood of afternoon light,
filtering through accumulated dust and soot.
The door upon the outer hall was latched. The
students, bizarre and unkempt in the bohemianism
of their cult, mixed colors on their palettes
as they listened. In their little world of narrow
horizons, the discourse was like a prophet       s
eulogy of a god.

As the master, his huge figure somewhat grotesque
in its long, paint-smeared blouse and cap,
stood delivering his lecture with much eloquence
of gesture, he was interrupted by a rap
on the door. Jacques du Bois, whose easel
stood nearest the threshold, reluctantly took his
pipe from his teeth, and turned the knob with
a scowl for the interruption. For a moment,
he stood talking through the slit with a gentleman
[Pg 288]
in the hall-way, his eyes meanwhile studying
with side-glances the lady who stood behind
the gentleman. Then, he bowed and closed the
door.

       Someone wishes a word with M. Hautecoeur,       
he announced.

The master stepped importantly into the hall,
and Steele introduced himself. M. Hautecoeur
declared that he quite well remembered monsieur
and his excellent painting. He bowed to
mademoiselle with unwieldly gallantry.

       Mr. Robert Saxon,        began the American,
       is, I believe, one of the most distinguished of
the followers of Frederick Marston. Miss
Filson and I are both friends of Mr. Saxon,
and, while in Paris, we wished to visit the
shrine of the Marston school. We have taken
the liberty of coming here. Is it possible to
admit us?       

The instructor looked cautiously into the
atelier, satisfied himself that the model had not
resumed her throne and nudity, then flung back
the door with a ceremonious sweep. Steele,
familiar with such surroundings, cast only a
casual glance about the interior. It was like
[Pg 289]
many of the smaller schools in which he had
himself painted. To the girl, who had never
seen a life-class at work, it was stepping into a
new world. Her eyes wandered about the
walls, and came back to the faces.

       I have never had the honor of meeting
your friend, Monsieur Saxon,        declared the instructor
in English.        But his reputation has
crossed the sea! I have had the pleasure of
seeing several of his canvases. There is none
of us following in the footsteps of Marston
who would not feel his life crowned with high
success, had he come as close as Saxon to grasping
the secret that made Marston Marston.
Your great country should be proud of him.       

Steele smiled.

       Our country could also claim Marston.
You forget that, monsieur.       

The instructor spread his hands in a deprecating
gesture.

       Ah, mon ami, that is debatable. True, your
country gave him birth, but it was France that
gave him his art.       

       Did you know,        suggested Steele,        that
some of the unsigned Saxon pictures have
[Pg 290]
passed competent critics as the work of Marston?       

Hautecoeur lifted his heavy brows.

       Impossible, monsieur,        he protested;        quite
impossible! It is the master       s boast that
any man who can pass a painting as a Marston
has his invitation to do so. He never
signs a canvas       it is unnecessary       his stroke       his
treatment       these are sufficient signature.
I do not belittle the art of your friend,        he hastened
to explain,        but there is a certain       what
shall I say?       a certain individualism about the
work of this greatest of moderns which is inimitable.
One must indeed be much the novice
to be misled. Yet, I grant you there was one
quality the master himself did not formerly
possess which the American grasped from the
beginning.       

       His virility of touch?        inquired Steele.

       Just so! Your man       s art is broader, perhaps
stronger. That difference is not merely
one of feeling: it is more. The American       s
style was the outgrowth of the bigness of your
vast spaces       of the broad spirit of your great
country       of the pride that comes to a man in
[Pg 291]
the consciousness of physical power and currents
of red blood! Marston was the creature
of a confined life, bounded by walls. He was
self-absorbed, morbid, anemic. To be the perfect
artist, he needed only to be the perfect animal!
He did not understand that. He disliked
physical effort. He felt that something
eluded him, and he fought for it with brush and
mahlstick. He should have used the Alpinstock
or the snow-shoe.        Hautecoeur was talking
with an enthused fervor that swept him into
metaphor.

       Yet               Steele was secretly sounding his way
toward the end he sought              yet, the latter pictures
of Marston have that same quality.       

       Precisely. I would in a moment more have
spoken of that. I have my theory. Since
leaving Paris, I believe Marston has gone perhaps
into the Alps, perhaps into other countries,
and built into himself the thing we urged
upon him       the robust vision.       

The girl spoke for the first time, putting,
after the fashion of the uninitiated, the question
which, the more learned hesitate to propound:

[Pg 292]
       What is this thing you call the secret?
What is it that makes the difference?       

       Ah, mademoiselle, if I knew that!        The
instructor sighed as he smiled.        How says the
English Fitzgerald?        A hair perhaps divides
the false and true.        Had Marston had the
making of the famous epigram, he would not
have said he mixed his paints with brains.
Rather would he have confessed, he mixed
them with ideals.       

       But I fear we delay the posing,        suggested
Steele, moving, with sudden apprehension,
toward the door.

       I assure you, no!        prevaricated the teacher,
with instant readiness.        It is a wearying
pose. The model will require a longer rest
than the usual. Will not mademoiselle permit
me to show her those Marston canvases we
are fortunate enough to have here? Perhaps,
she will then understand why I find it impossible
to answer her question.       


When Captain Paul Harris had set his course
to France with a slow, long voyage ahead, his
shanghaied passenger had gone from stunned
[Pg 293]
unconsciousness into the longer and more complicated
helplessness of brain-fever. There
was a brushing of shoulders with death. There
were fever and unconsciousness and delirium,
and through each phase Dr. Cornish, late of
the Foreign Legion, brought his patient with
studious care       through all, that is, save the
brain fog. Then, as the vessel drew to the end
of the voyage, the physical illness appeared to
be conquered, yet the awakening had been only
that of nerves and bodily organs. The center
of life, the mind, was as remote and incommunicable
as though the thought nerves had been
paralyzed. Saxon was like a country whose
outer life is normal, but whose capital is cut off
and whose government is supine. The physician,
studying with absorbed interest, struggled
to complete the awakening. Unless it should be
complete, it were much better that the man had
died, for, when the vessel dropped her anchor
at Havre, the captain led ashore a man who in
the parlance of the peasants was a poor        innocent,       
a human blank-book in a binding once
handsome, now worn, with nothing inscribed
on its pages.

[Pg 294]
For a time, the physician and skipper were
puzzled as to the next step. The physician
was confident that the eyes, which gazed blankly
out from a face now bearded and emaciated,
would eventually regain their former light of
intelligence. He did not believe that this helpless
creature       who had been, when he first saw
him in Puerto Frio, despite blood-discolored
face and limp unconsciousness, so perfect a figure
of a man       had passed into permanent darkness.
The light would again dawn, possibly
at first in fitful waverings and flashes through
the fog. If only there could be some familiar
scene or thing to suggest the past! But, unfortunately,
all that lay across the world. So, they
decided to take him to Paris, and ensconce him
in Captain Harris        modest lodgings in the Rue
St. Jacques, and, inasmuch as the captain       s lodgings
were shared by no one, and his landlady
was a kindly soul, Dr. Cornish also resolved to
go there. For a few weeks, the sailor was to
be home from the sea, and meant to spend his
holiday in the capital. As for the physician, he
was just now unattached. He had hoped to be
in charge of a government       s work of health
[Pg 295]
and sanitation. Instead, he was idle, and could
afford to remain and study an unusual condition.
He certainly could not abandon this
anonymous creature whom fate had thrust
upon his keeping. Now, six weeks after his
accident, Saxon sat alone in the modest apartment
of the lodgings in the Rue St. Jacques.
Since his arrival in Paris, the walls of that room
and the court in the center of the house had been
the boundaries of his world. He had not seen
beyond them. He had been physically weak
and languid, mentally void. They had attempted
to persuade him to move about, but his
apathy had been insuperable. Sometimes, he
wandered about the court like a small child.
He had no speech. Often, he fingered a rusty
key as a baby fingers a rattle. On the day that
Steele and Duska had gone to the academy of
M. Hautecoeur, Dr. Cornish and Paul Harris
had left the lodgings for a time, and Saxon sat
as usual at a window, looking absently out on
the court.

In its center stood a stone jardini        re, now
empty. About it was the flagged area, also
empty. In front was the street-door       closed.
[Pg 296]
Saxon looked out with the opaque stare of
pupils that admit no images to the brain. They
were as empty as the stone jar. Possibly, the
sun, borrowing some of the warmth of the
spent summer, made a vague appeal to animal
instinct; possibly, the first ray of mental dawn
was breaking. At all events, Saxon rose
heavily, and made his way into the area.

At last, he wandered to the street-door. It happened
to be closed, but the concierge stood near.

       Cordon?        inquired the porter, with a smile.
It is the universal word with which lodgers in
such abodes summon the guardian of the gate
to let them in or out.

Saxon looked up, and across the hitherto unbroken
vacancy of his pupils flickered a disturbed,
puzzled tremor of mental groping.

He opened his thin lips, closed them again,
then smiled, and said with perfect distinctness:

       Cordon, s       il vous plait.       

The concierge knew only that monsieur was
an invalid. In his next question was nothing
more than simple Gallic courtesy.

       Est-ce que monsieur va mieux aujour
d       hui?       

[Pg 297]
Once more, Saxon       s lips hesitated, then mechanically
moved.

       Oui, merci,        he responded.

The man who found himself standing aimlessly
on the sidewalk of the Rue St. Jacques,
was a man clothed in an old and ill-fitting suit
of Captain Harris        clothes. He was long-haired,
hollow-cheeked and bearded like a pirate.
At last, he hesitatingly turned and wandered
away at random. About him lay Paris
and the world, but Paris and the world were
to him things without names or meaning.

His unguided steps carried him to the banks
of the Seine, and finally he stood on the island,
gazing without comprehension at the square
towers of N       tre Dame, his brows strangely
puckered as his eyes picked out the carvings of
the        Last Judgment        and the Galerie des
Rois.

He shook his head dully, and, turning once
more, went on without purpose until at the end
of much wandering he again halted. This time,
he had before him the Panth        on       s entrance, and
confronting him on its pedestal sat a human
figure in bronze. It was Rodin       s unspeakably
[Pg 298]
melancholy conception,        le Penseur,        and it
might have stood for Saxon       s self as it half-crouched
with limbs tense and brows drawn in,
in the agony of brooding thought-travail.

Then, Saxon       s head came up, and into his eyes
stole a confused groping, as though reason       s
tentacles were struggling out blindly for something
upon which to lay hold. With such a
motion perhaps, the prehistoric man-creature
may have thrown up his chin at the bursting
into being of thought       s first coherent germ. But
from        le Penseur        Saxon turned away with a
futile shake of his head to resume his wanderings.

Finally, in a narrow cross street, he halted
once more, and looked about him with a consciousness
of vast weariness. He had traversed
the length of many blocks in his aimlessness,
crossing and recrossing his own course, and he
was still feeble from long days of illness and
inertia.

Suddenly, he raised his head, and his lips,
which had been half-parted in the manner of
lips not obeying a positive brain, closed in a
firm line that seemed to make his chin and jaw
[Pg 299]
take on a stronger contour. He drew his
brows together as he stood studying the door
before him, and his pupils were deeply vague
and perplexed. But it was a different perplexity.
The vacuity was gone.

Automatically, one thin hand went into the
trousers-pocket, and came out clutching a rusty
key. For another moment, he stood regarding
the thing, turning it over in his fingers. Then,
he laughed, and drew back his sagging shoulders.
With the gesture, he threw away all imbecility,
and followed the inexorable call of
some impulse which he could not yet fully
understand, but which was neither vague nor
haphazard.

At that moment, Dr. Cornish, chancing to
glance up from his course a block away, stopped
dumfounded at the sight of his patient. When
he had gathered his senses, and looked again,
the patient had disappeared.

Saxon walked a few steps further, turned into
an open street-door, passed the concierge without
a word, and toilsomely, but with a purposeful
tread, mounted the narrow, ill-lighted
stairs. At the turning where strangers usually
[Pg 300]
stumbled, he lifted his foot clear for the longer
stride, yet he had not glanced down.

For just a moment, he paused for breath in
the hall, upon which opened several doors identical
in appearance. Without hesitation, he fitted
the ancient key into an equally ancient lock,
opened the door, and entered.

At the click of the thrown tumbler of the
lock, some of the occupants of the place glanced
up. They saw the door swing wide, and frame
between its jambs a tall, thin man, who stood
unsteadily supporting himself against the case.
The black-bearded face was flushed with a
burning fever, but the eyes that looked out
from under the heavy brows were wide awake
and intelligent.

       But Marston will one day return to us,       
Monsieur Hautecoeur was declaring to Steele
and the girl, who, with backs to the door, were
studying a picture on the wall.        He will return,
and then                     





The instructor had caught the sound of the
opening door, and he half-turned his head to
cast a side glance in its direction. His words
died suddenly on his lips. His pose became
[Pg 301]
petrified; his features transfixed with astonishment.
His rigid fixity of face and figure froze
the watching students into answering tenseness.
Even the blanket-wrapped model held a freshly
lighted cigarette poised half-way to her lips.
Then, the man in the door took an unsteady
step forward, and from his trembling fingers
the key fell to the floor, where in the dead stillness
it seemed to strike with a crash. The
girl and Steele wheeled. At that moment, the
lips of the bearded face moved, and from them
came the announcement:

       Me voici, je viens d       arriver.       

The voice broke the hypnotic suspense of the
silence as a pin-point snaps a toy balloon.

Hautecoeur sprang excitedly forward.

       Marston! Marston has returned!        he
shouted, in a great voice that echoed against the
sky-light.

As the man stepped forward, he staggered
slightly, and would have fallen had he not been
already folded in the giant embrace of the
lesser master.

Duska stood as white as the fresh sheets of
drawing-paper at her feet. Her fingers
[Pg 302]
spasmodically clenched and opened at her sides, and
from her teeth, biting into the lower lip, her
breathing came in gasps. The walls seemed to
race in circles, and it was with half-realization
that she heard Steele calling the man, wildly
demanding recognition.

The newcomer was leaning heavily on Hautecoeur       s
arm. He did not appear to notice
Steele, but his gaze met and held the girl       s pallid
face and the intensely anguished eyes that
looked into his. For an instant, they stood facing
each other, neither speaking; then, in a
voice of polite concern, the tall man said:

       Mademoiselle is ill!        There was no note
of recognition       only, the solicitous tone of any
man who sees a woman who is obviously suffering.

Duska raised her chin. Her throat gave a
convulsive jerk, but she only caught her lip more
tightly between her teeth, so that a moment
later, when she spoke, there were purplish indentations
on its almost bloodless line.

She half-turned to Steele. Her voice was an
utterly hopeless whisper, but as steady as Marston       s
had been.

[Pg 303]
       For God       s sake,        she said,        take me
home!       

At the door, they encountered the excited
physician, who stumbled against them with a
mumbled apology as he burst into the atelier.





[Pg 304]

CHAPTER XIX


Late that afternoon, in Mrs. Horton       s
drawing-room at the H       tel Palais d       Orsay,
Steele stood at the window, his gaze almost sullen
in the moodiness of his own ineffectual sympathy.
The day had grown as cheerless as
himself. Outside, across the Quai d       Orsay, a
cold rain pelted desolately into the gray water
of the Seine, and drew a wet veil across the opposite
bank. Through the reeking mist, the
remote gray branches in the Gardens of the
Tuileries stood out starkly naked. Even the
vague masses of the Louvre seemed as forbidding
as the shadowy bulk of some buttressed
prison. The        taxis        slurred by through wet
streets, and those persons who were abroad
went with streaming umbrellas and hurried
steps. The raw chill of Continental hotels permeated
the place. He knew that in the center
of the room Duska sat, her elbows resting on
the table top; her eyes, distressfully wide, fixed
[Pg 305]
on the wet panes of the other window. He
knew that, if he spoke to her, her lips would
shape themselves into a pathetic smile, and her
answer would be steady. He knew that she
had given herself no luxury of outburst, but
that she had remained there, in much the same
attitude, all afternoon; sometimes, crushing her
small handkerchief into a tight wad of lace and
linen; sometimes, opening it out and smoothing
it with infinite care into a tiny square upon
the table. He knew that her feet, with their
small shoes and high-arched, silk-stockinged insteps,
twitched nervously from time to time; that
the gallant shoulders drooped forward. These
details were pictured in his mind, and he kept
his eyes stolidly pointed toward the outer gloom
so that he might not be forced to see it all
again in actuality.

At last, he wheeled with a sudden gesture of
desperation, and, going across to the table,
dropped his hand over hers.

She looked up with the unchanged expression
of wide-eyed suffering that has no outlet.

       Duska, dear,        he asked,        can I do anything?       

[Pg 306]
She shook her head, and, as she answered, it
was in a dead voice.        There is nothing to
do.       

       If I leave you, will you promise to cry?
You must cry,        he commanded.

       I can       t cry,        she answered, in the same expressionless
flatness of tone.

       Duska, can you forgive me?        He had
moved around, and stood leaning forward with
his hands resting upon the table.

       Forgive you for what?       

       For being the author of all this hideous
calamity,        he burst out with self-accusation,
       for bringing him there       for introducing
you.       

She reached out suddenly, and seized his
hand.

       Don       t!        she pleaded.        Do you suppose
that I would give up a memory that I have?
Why, all my world is memory now! Do you
suppose I blame you       or him?       

       You might very well blame us both. We
both knew of the possibilities, and let things
go on.       

She rose, and let her eyes rest on him with
[Pg 307]
directness. Her voice was not angry, but very
earnest.

       That is not true,        she said.        It couldn       t
be helped. It was written. He told me everything.
He asked me to forget, and I held him       because
we loved each other. He could no
more help it than he could help being himself,
fulfilling his genius when he thought he was
following another man. There are just some
things               she halted a moment, and shook her
head              some things,        she went on quietly,
       that are bigger than we are.       

       But, now                      He stopped.

       But, now               the quiet of her words hurt
the man more than tears could have done              now,
his real life has claimed him       the life
that only loaned him to me.       

The telephone jangled suddenly, and Steele,
whose nerves were all on edge, started violently
at the sound. Mechanically, he took up the instrument
from its table-rack, and listened.

       Yes, this is Mr. Steele. What? Mr. St.
John? Tell him I       ll see him down there       to
wait for me.        Steele was about to replace the
receiver, when Duska       s hand caught his wrist.

[Pg 308]
       No,        she said quickly,        have him come
here.       

       Wait. Hold the wire.        The man turned
to the girl.

       Duska, you are only putting yourself on
the rack,        he pleaded.        Let me see him
alone.        She shook her head with the old determination.
       Have him come here,        she repeated.

       Send Mr. St. John up,        ordered the Kentuckian.

One might have seen from his eyes that, when
Mr. St. John arrived, his reception would be
ungracious. The man felt all the stored-up
savagery born of his helpless remonstrance. It
must have some vent. Every one and everything
that had contributed to her misery were
alike hateful to him. Had he been able to talk
to Saxon just then, his unreasoning wrath would
have poured itself forth as readily and bitterly
as on St. John. The sight of the agent
standing in the door a few moments later, inoffensive,
even humble, failed to mollify him.

       I shall have the two pictures delivered
within the next day,        ventured the Englishman.

[Pg 309]
Steele turned brutally on the visitor.

       Do you mean to risk remaining in Paris
now?        he demanded.

At the tone, St. John stiffened. He was humble
because these people had been kind. Now,
meeting hostility, he threw off his lowly demeanor.

       Why, may I ask, should I leave Paris?       
There was a touch of delicately shaded defiance
in the questioning voice.

       Because, now, you must reckon with Mr.
Saxon for pirating his work! Because he may
choose to make you walk the plank.       

Steele whipped out his answer in rapid, angry
sentences.

St. John met the eyes of the Kentuckian insolently.

       Pardon the suggestion that you misstate the
case,        he said, softly.        I have never sold a
picture as a Marston that was not a Marston       it
would appear that unconsciously I was, after
all, honest. As for Mr. Saxon, there is, it
seems, no Mr. Saxon. That gentleman was
entirely mythical. It was an alias, if you
please.       

[Pg 310]
It was Steele who winced now, but his retort
was contemptuously cool:

       Do you fancy Mr. Marston will accept that
explanation?       

       Mr. Steele               the derelict drew back his
thin shoulders, and faced the other with a glint
in the pale pupils that was an echo of the days
when he had been able to look men in the face.
       Before I became a scoundrel, sir, I was a
gentleman. My daughter is extremely ill. I
must remain with her, and take the chance as
to what Mr. Marston may choose to do. I
shall hope that he will make some allowance
for a father       s desperate       if unscrupulous       effort
to care for his daughter. I hope so particularly
inasmuch as that daughter is also his
wife.       

Steele started forward, his eyes going involuntarily
to the girl, but she sat unflinching, except
that a sudden, spasm of pain crossed the
hopelessness of her eyes. Somewhere among
Duska Filson       s ancestors, there had been a stoic.
Instantly, Steele realized that it was he himself
who had brought about the needless cruelty of
that reminder. St. John had disarmed him, and
put him in the wrong.

[Pg 311]
       I beg your pardon, sir,        he said.

       I came here,        said St. John slowly,        not
only to notify you about your canvases. There
was something else. You were both very considerate
when I was here before. It is strange
that a man who will do dishonest things still
clings to the wish that his occasional honest motives
shall not be misconstrued. I don       t want
you to think that I intentionally lied to you then.
I told you Frederick Marston was dead. I believed
it. Before I began this       this piracy, I
investigated, and satisfied myself on the point.
Time corroborated me. It is as though he had
arisen from the grave. That is all.       

The man paused; then, looking at the girl, he
continued:

       And Mr. Saxon               he hesitated a moment
upon the name, but went resolutely on              Mr.
Saxon will recover. When he wakes next, the
doctors believe, he will awake to everything.
After his violent exertion and the shock of his
partial realization, he became delirious. For
several days perhaps, he must have absolute
quiet, but he will take up a life in which there
are no empty spaces.       

The girl rose, and, as she spoke, there was a
[Pg 312]
momentary break in her voice that led Steele
to hope for the relief of tears, but her tone
steadied itself, and her eyes remained dry.

       Mr. St. John,        she said slowly,        may I go
and see       your daughter?       

For a moment, the Englishman looked at her
quietly, then tears flooded his eyes. He thought
of the message of the portrait, and, with no information
except that of his own observing eyes,
he read a part at least of the situation.

       Miss Filson,        he said with as simple a dignity
as though his name had never been tarnished,
as though the gentleman had never decayed
into the derelict,        my daughter would
be happy to receive you, but she is in no condition
to hear startling news. By her own wish,
we have not in seven years spoken of Mr.
Marston. She does not know that I believed
him dead, she does not know that he has reappeared.
To tell her would endanger her
life.       

       I shall not go as a bearer of news,        the girl
assured him;        I shall go only as a friend of her
father       s, and       because I want to.       

St. John hesitatingly put out his hand. When
[Pg 313]
the girl gave him hers, he bent over it with a
catch in his voice, but a remnant of the grand
manner, and kissed her fingers in the fashion of
the old days.

Driving with Steele the next morning to St.
John       s lodgings, the girl looked straight ahead
steadfastly. The rain of the night had been
forgotten, and the life of Paris glittered with
sun and brilliant abandon. Pleasure-worship
and vivacious delight seemed to lie like a spirit
of the departed summer on the boulevards.
Along the Champs Elys        es, from the Place de
la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe, flowed a
swift, continuous parade of motors, bearing in
state gaily dressed women, until the nostrils
were filled with a strangely blended odor of
gasoline and flowers. The pavement caf        s and
sidewalks flashed color, and echoed laughter.
Nowhere, from the spot where the guillotine
had stood to the circle where Napoleon decreed
his arch, did there seem a niche for sorrow.

       Will you wait here to see to what he awakens?       
questioned Steele.

Duska shook her head.

       I have no right to wait. And yet       yet, I
[Pg 314]
can       t go home!        She leaned toward him, impulsively.
       I couldn       t bear going back to Kentucky
now,        she added, plaintively;        I couldn       t
bear it.       

       You will go to Nice for a while,        said
Steele, firmly. He had fallen into the position,
of arranging their affairs. Mrs. Horton, distressed
in Duska       s distress, found herself helpless
to act except upon his direction.

The girl nodded, apathetically.

       It doesn       t matter,        she said.

Then, she looked up again.

       But I want you to stay. I want you to do
everything you can for both of them.        She
paused, and her next words were spoken with
an effort:        And I don       t want       I don       t want
you to speak of me. I don       t want you to try to
remind him.       

       He will question me,        demurred Steele.

Duska       s head was raised with a little gesture
of pride.

       I am not afraid,        she said,        that he will
ask you anything he should not       anything that
he has not the right to ask.       





[Pg 315]

CHAPTER XX


When he turned back, a day later, from
the turmoil of the station, from the strenuous
labor of weighing trunks, locating the compartment
in the train, subsidizing the guards, and,
hardest of all, saying good-bye to Duska with
a seeming or normal cheerfulness, Steele found
himself irritably out of measure with the quick-step
of Paris. Mrs. Horton and the girl were
on their way to the Riviera. He was left behind
to watch results; almost, it seemed to him,
to sit by and observe the post-mortem on every
hope in the lives of three people. Nice should
still be quiet. The tidal wave of        trippers       
would not for a little while sweep over its rose-covered
slopes and white beaches and dazzling
esplanades, and the place would afford the girl
at least every soothing influence that nature
could offer. That would not be much, but it
would be something.

As for himself, he felt the isolation of Paris.
[Pg 316]
On a desert, a man may become lonely; in deep
forests and on high mountains, he may come to
know and hate his own soul in solitude, but the
last note of aloofness, of utter exile, is that
which comes to him who looks vainly for one
face in a sea of other faces, whose small cosmos
lies in unwept and unnoticed ruin in the midst
of a giant city that moves along its indifferent
way to the time of dance-music. In the hotel,
there was the chatter of tourists. His own
tongue was prattled by men and women whose
lives seemed to revolve around the shops of the
Rue de la Paix, or whose literature was the information
of the guide-books. He felt that
everyone was invading his somberness of mood
with trivialities, until, in revulsion against the
whole stage-setting of things, he had himself
and his luggage transported to the H       tel Voltaire,
where the life about him was the simpler
life of the less pretentious quais of the Seine.

After his d        jeuner, he sat for a time attempting
to readjust his ideas. He had told Saxon
that he would never again speak of love to
Duska. Now, he realized how barren of hope
it would ever be for him to renew his plea. She
[Pg 317]
had bankrupted his heart. He had buried his
own hopes, and no one except himself had
known at what cost to himself. He had taken
his place in the niche dedicated to closest friend,
just outside the inner shrine reserved for the
one who could penetrate that far. Now, he was
in a greater distress. Now, he wanted only her
happiness, and as he had never wanted it before.
Now, he realized that the only source through
which this could come was the source that
seemed hopelessly clogged. There was no
doubt of his sincerity. Even his own intimate
questioning acquitted him of self-consideration.
Could he at that moment have had one wish
fulfilled by some magic agency of miracle, that
wish would have been that he might lead Robert
Saxon, as Robert Saxon had been, to Duska,
with all his memory and love intact, and free
from any incumbrance that might divide them.
That would have been the gift of all gifts, and
the only gift that would drive the look of heart-hunger
and despair from her eyes.

Steele was restless, and, taking up his hat, he
strolled out along the quay, and turned at last
into the Boulevard St. Michel, stretching off in
[Pg 318]
a broad vista of caf        -lined sidewalks. The life
of the        Boule Mich        held no attraction for
him. In his earlier days, he had known it from
the river to the Boulevard Montparnasse. He
knew its tributary streets, its lodgings, its schools
and the life which the spirit of the modern
is so rapidly revolutionizing from Bohemia       s
shabby capital to a conventionalized district.
None of these things held for him the piquant
challenge of novelty.

As he passed a certain caf        , which he had
once known as the informal club of the Marston
cult, he realized that here the hilarity was
more pronounced than elsewhere. The boulevard
itself was for squares a thread, stringing
caf        s like beads in a necklace. Each had its
crowd of revelers; its boisterous throng of
frowsy, velvet-jacketed, long-haired students;
its laughing models; its inevitable brooding and
despondent absintheurs sitting apart in isolated
melancholy. Yet, here at the        Chat Noir,        the
chorus was noisier. Although the evening was
chill, the sidewalk tables were by no means deserted.
The Parisian proves his patriotism
by his adherence to the out-door table, even if
[Pg 319]
he must turn up his collar, and shiver as he sips
his wine.

Listlessly, Steele turned into the place. It
was so crowded this evening that for a time it
looked as though he would have difficulty in
finding a seat. At last, a waiter led him to a
corner where, dropping to the seat along the
wall, he ordered his wine, and sat gloomily
looking on.

The place was unchanged. There were still
the habitu        s quarreling over their warring tenets
of the brush; men drawn to the center of
painting as moths are drawn to a candle; men
of all nationalities and sorts, alike only in the
general quality of their unkempt grotesquerie.

There was music of a sort; a plaintive chord
long-drawn from the violin occasionally made
its sweet wail heard above the babel and through
the reeking smoke of the room. Evidently, it
was some occasion beyond the ordinary, and
Steele, leaning over to the student nearest him,
inquired in French:

       Is there some celebration?       

The stranger was a short man, with hair that
fell low on his neck and greased his collar. He
[Pg 320]
had a double-pointed beard and deep-set black
eyes, which he kept fixed on his absinthe as it
dripped drop by drop from the nickeled device
attached to his frapp         glass. At the question,
he looked up, astonished.

       But is it possible monsieur does not know?
We are all brothers here       brothers in the worship
of the beautiful! Does not monsieur
know?       

Steele did not know, and he told the stranger
so without persiflage.

       It is that the great Marston has returned!       
proclaimed the student, in a loud voice.        It is
that the master has come back to us       to
Paris!       

The sound of his voice had brought others
about the table.        Does monsieur know that
the Seine flows?        demanded a pearly pretty
model, raising her glass and flashing from her
dark eyes a challenging glance of ridicule.

Steele did not object to the good-humored
baiting, but he looked about him, and was
thankful that the girl on her way to Nice could
not look in on this enthusiasm over the painter       s
home-coming; could not see to what Marston
[Pg 321]
was returning; what character of devotees were
pledging the promotion of the first disciple to
the place of the worshiped master.

Some half-drunken student, his hand upon
the shoulder of a model, lifted a tilting glass,
and shouted thickly,        Vive l       art! Vive Marston!       
The crowd took up the shout, and there
was much clinking of glass.

Steele, with a feeling of deep disgust, rose to
go. The other quais of the Seine were better
after all. But, as he reached for his hat, he felt
a hand on his shoulder, and, turning, recognized,
with a glow of welcome, the face of M.
Herv        . Like himself, M. Herv         seemed out
of his element, or would have seemed so had
he also not had, like Steele, that adaptability
which makes some men fit into the picture wherever
they may find themselves. The two shook
hands, and dropped back on the cushions of the
wall seat.

       I have heard the story,        the Frenchman assured
Steele.        Monsieur may spare himself
the pain of repeating it. It is a miracle!       

Steele was looking into his glass.

       It is a most unhappy miracle,        he replied.

[Pg 322]
       But, mon dieu!        M. Herv         looked across
the table, tapping the Kentuckian       s sleeve with
his outstretched fingers.        It makes one think,
mon ami       it makes one think!       

His vis-        -vis only nodded, and Herv         went
on:

       It brings home to one the indestructibility
of the true genius       the unquenchable fire of it!
Destiny plays a strange game. She has here
taken a man, and juggled with his life; battered
his identity to unrecognizable fragments; set a
seal on his past. Yet, his genius she could not
efface. That burned through to the light       sounded
on insistently through the confusion of
wreck, even as that violin sounds through this
hell of noises and disorder       the great unsilenced
chord! The man thinks he copies another.
Not so       he is merely groping to find himself.
Never have I thought so deeply as since I have
heard this story.       

For a time, Steele did not reply. To him,
the personal element drowned the purely academic
interest of the psychological phase in this
tragedy.

Suddenly, a new element of surprise struck
[Pg 323]
him, and he leaned across the table, his voice
full of questioning.

       But you,        he demanded,        you had studied
under Marston. You knew him, and yet, when
you saw Saxon, you had no recognition.       

M. Herv         nodded his head with grave
assent.

       That was my first incredulous thought when
I heard of this miracle,        he admitted;        yet,
only for a moment. After all, that was inevitable.
They were different. Now, bearded,
ill, depleted, I fancy he may once more look
the man I knew       that man whose hair was a
mane, and whose morbid timidity gave to his
eyes a haunted and uncertain fire. When I saw
Saxon, it is true I saw a man wounded and unconscious;
his face covered with blood and the
dirt of the street, yet he was, even so, the man
of splendid physique       the new man remade
by the immensity of your Western prairies       having
acquired all that the man I had known
lacked. He was transformed. In that, his Destiny
was kind       she gave it not only to his body,
but to his brush. He was before a demi-god of
the palette. Now, he is the god.       

[Pg 324]
       Do you chance to know,        asked Steele suddenly,
       how his hand was pierced?       

       Have you not heard that story?        the
Frenchman asked.        I am regrettably responsible
for that. We sought to make him build
the physical man. I persuaded him to fence,
though he did it badly and without enthusiasm.
One evening, we were toying with sharpened
foils. Partly by his carelessness and partly by
my own, the blade went through his palm. For
a long period, he could not paint.       

Frederick Marston was not at once removed
from the lodgings in the Rue St. Jacques. Absolute
rest was what he most required. When
he awoke again, unless he awoke refreshed by
sufficient rest, Dr. Cornish held out no hope.
The strain upon enfeebled body and brain had
been great, and for days he remained delirious
or unconscious. Dr. Cornish was like adamant
in his determination that he should be left undisturbed
for a week or more.

Meanwhile, the episode had unexpected results.
The physician who had come to Paris
fleeing from a government he had failed to
overturn, who had taken an emergency case
[Pg 325]
because there was no one else at hand, found himself
suddenly heralded by the Paris press as
       that distinguished specialist, Dr. Cornish,
who is effecting a miraculous recovery for the
greatest of painters.       

During these days, Steele was constantly at
the lodgings, and with him, sharing his anxiety,
was M. Herv        . There were many callers
to inquire       painters and students of the neighborhood,
and the greater celebrities from the
more distinguished schools.

But no one was more constantly in attendance
than Alfred St. John. He divided his time between
the bedside of his daughter and the lodgings
where Marston lay. The talk that filled
the Latin Quarter, and furiously excited the
studio on the floor below, was studiously kept
from the girl confined to her couch upstairs.

One day while St. John was in the Rue St. Jacques,
pacing the small cour with Steele and
Herv        , Jean Hautecoeur came in hurriedly.
His manner was that of anxious embarrassment,
and for a moment he paused, seeking words.

St. John       s face turned white with a divination
of his tidings.

[Pg 326]
       Does she need me?        he asked, almost
breathlessly.

Hautecoeur nodded, and St. John turned
toward the door. Steele went with him, and,
as they climbed the steep stairs, the old man
leaned heavily on his support.

The Kentuckian waited in St. John       s room
most of that night. In the next apartment were
the girl, her father and the physician. A little
before dawn, the old man came out. His step
was almost tottering, and he seemed to have
aged a decade since he entered the door of the
sick-room.

       My daughter is dead,        he said very simply,
as his guest paused at the threshold.        I am
leaving Paris. My people except for me have
borne a good name. I wanted to ask you to
save that name from exposure. I wanted to
bury with my daughter everything that might
shadow her memory. For myself, nothing
matters.       

Steele took the hand the Englishman held
tremblingly outstretched.

       Is there anything else I can do?        he asked.

St. John shook his head.

       That will be quite all,        he answered.

[Pg 327]
Such things as had to be done, however, Steele
did, and two days later, when Alfred St. John
took the train for Calais and the Channel, it
was with assurances that, while they could
not at this time cheer him, at least fortified
him against all fear of need.

It was a week later that Cornish sent for the
Kentuckian, who was waiting in the court.

       I think you can see him now,        said the physician
briefly,        and I think you will see a man
who has no gaps in his memory.       

Steele went with some misgiving to the sick-room.
He found Marston looking at him with
eyes as clear and lucid as his own. As he came
up, the other extended a hand with a trembling
gesture of extreme weakness. Steele
clasped it in silence.

For a time, neither spoke.

While Steele waited, the other       s face became
drawn. He was evidently struggling with himself
in desperate distress. There was something
to be said which Marston found it bitterly
difficult to say. At last, he spoke slowly,
forcing his words and holding his features in
masklike rigidity of control.

       I remember it all now, George.        He
[Pg 328]
hesitated as his friend nodded; then, with a drawing
of his brows and a tremendous effort, he added,
huskily:

       And I must go to my wife.       

Steele hesitated before answering.

       You can       t do that, Bob,        he said, gently.
       I was near her as long as could be. I think
she is entirely happy now.       

The man in the bed looked up. His eyes
read the eyes of the other. If there was in his
pulse a leaping sense of release, he gave it no
expression.

       Dead?        he whispered.

Steele nodded.

For a time, Marston gazed up at the ceiling
with a fixed stare. Then, his face clouded with
black self-reproach.

       If I could blot out that injury from memory!
God knows I meant it as kindness.       

       There is time enough to forget,        said
Steele.

It was some days later that Marston went
with Steele to the H       tel Voltaire. There was
much to be explained and done. He learned
for the first time the details of the expedition
[Pg 329]
that Steele had made to South America, and
then to Europe; of the matter of the pictures
and St. John       s connection with them, and of the
mystifying circumstances of the name registered
at the Elys        e Palace H       tel. That incident they
never fathomed.

St. John had buried his daughter in the Cimeti        re
Montmartre. After the first mention of
the matter on his recovery to consciousness,
Marston had not again alluded to his former
wife, until he was able to go to the spot, and
place a small tribute on her grave. Standing
there, somewhat awestruck, his face became
deeply grave, and, looking up at his friend, he
spoke with deep agitation:

       There is one part of my life that was a tremendous
mistake. I sought to act with regard
for a misconceived duty and kindness, and I
only inflicted infinite pain. I want you to know,
and I tell you here at a spot that is to me very
solemn, that I never abandoned her. When I
left for America, it was at her command. It
was with the avowal that I should remain subject
to her recall as long as we both lived. I
should have kept my word. It       s not a thing
[Pg 330]
that I can talk of again. You know all that
has happened since, but for once I must tell
you.       

Steele felt that nothing he could say would
make the recital easier, and he merely inclined
his head.

       I shall have her removed to England, if
St. John wishes it,        Marston said.        God
knows I       d like to have the account show some
offsetting of the debit.       

As they left the gates for the omnibus, Marston
added:

       If St. John will continue to act as my agent,
he can manage it from the other side of the
Channel. I shall not be often in Paris.       

Later, he turned suddenly to the Kentuckian,
with a half-smile.

       We swindled St. John,        he exclaimed.
       We bought back the pictures at Saxon prices.       
His voice became unusually soft.        And Frederick
Marston can never paint another so good
as the portrait. We must set that right. Do
you know               the man laughed sheepishly              it       s
rather disconcerting to find that one has
spent seven years in self-worship?       

[Pg 331]
Steele smiled with relief at the change of
subject.

       Is that the sensation of being deified?        he
demanded.        Does one simply feel that Olympus
is drawn down to sea level?       

Shortly after, Marston sent a brief note to
Duska.

       I shall say little,        he wrote.        I can       t be
sure you will give me a hearing, but also I can
not go on until I have begged it. I can not
bear that any report shall reach you until I
have myself reported. My only comfort is that
I concealed nothing that I had the knowledge
to tell you. There is now no blank in my life,
and yet it is all blank, and must remain blank
unless I can come to you. I am free to speak,
and, if you give it to me, no one else can deny
me the right to speak. All that I said on that
night when a certain garden was bathed in the
moon is more true now than then, and now I
speak with full knowledge. Can you forgive
everything?       

And the girl reading the letter let it drop in
her lap, and looked out through her window
across the dazzling whiteness of the Promenade
[Pg 332]
des Anglais to the purple Mediterranean.
Once more, her eyes lighted from deep cobalt to
violet.

       But there was nothing to forgive,        she
softly told the sea.





[Pg 333]

CHAPTER XXI


When, a month later, Frederick Marston
went to the hotel on the Promenade des Anglais
at Nice, it was a much improved and rejuvenated
man as compared with the wasted
creature who had opened the closed door of the
       academy        in the Quartier Latin, and had
dropped the key on the floor. Although still a
trifle gaunt, he was much the same person who,
almost a year before, had clung to the pickets at
Churchill Downs, and halted in his view of a
two-year-old finish. Just as the raw air of the
north had given place to the wooing softness of
the Riviera, and the wet blankets of haze over
the gardens of the Tuileries to the golden sunlight
of the flower-decked south, so he had come
again out of winter into spring, and the final result
of his life       s equation was the man that had
been Saxon, untouched by the old Marston.

Duska       s stay at Nice had been begun in apathy.
About her were all the influences of beauty
[Pg 334]
and roses and soft breezes, but it was not until
she had read this first letter from Marston that
these things meant anything to her. Then, suddenly,
she had awakened to a sense of its delight.
She knew that he would not come at
once, and she felt that this was best. She
wanted him to come back to her when he could
come as the man who had been in her life, and,
since she knew he was coming, she could wait.
Her eyes had become as brightly blue as the
Mediterranean mirroring the sky, and her
cheeks had again taken on their kinship to the
roses of the Riviera. Once more, she was one
with the nature of this favored spot, a country
that some magical realist seems to have torn
bodily from the enchanted Isles of Imagination,
and transplanted in the world of Fact.

Now, she became eager to see everything, and
it so happened that, when Marston, who had not
notified her of the day of his arrival, reached
her hotel, it was to find that she and her aunt
had motored over to Monte Carlo, by the upper
Corniche Road, that show-drive of the world
which climbs along the heights with the sea below
and the sky, it would seem, not far above.

[Pg 335]
The man turned out again to the Promenade
des Anglais. The sun was shining on its whiteness,
and it seemed that the city was a huge
structure of solid marble, set between the sea
and the color-spotted slopes of the villa-clad
hills.

Marston was highly buoyant as he made his
way to the garage where he could secure a car
to give chase. He even paused with boyish and
delighted interest to gaze into the glittering
shop windows of the Promenade and the Avenue
Felix Faure, where were temptingly displayed
profound booklets guaranteeing the purchaser
a sure system for conquering the chances
of roulette        on a capital of        9, playing red or
black, manque or passe, pair or impair, and
compiled by one with four years of experience.       

He had soon negotiated for a car, and had
gained the friendship of a chauffeur, who
grinned happily and with contentment when he
learned that monsieur       s object was speed.
Ahead of him stretched nine miles of perfect
macadam, with enough beauty to fill the eye
and heart with joy for every mile, and at the
[Pg 336]
end of the journey       unless he could happily
overtake her sooner       was Duska.

The car sped up between the villas, up to the
white ribbon of road where the ships, lying at
anchor in the purpled water beneath, were white
toys no longer than pencils, where towns were
only patches of roof tiles, and mountainsides
mere rumpled blankets of green and color;
where the road-houses were delights of picturesque
rusticity and flower-covered walls.

Thanks to a punctured tire, Marston found
a large dust-coated car standing at the roadside
when he had covered only half of the journey.
It was drawn up near a road-house that sat back
of a rough stone wall, and was abandoned save
for the chauffeur, who labored over his task of
repair. But Marston stopped and ran up the
stone stairs to the small terrace, where, between
rose bushes that crowded the time-stained
fa        ade of the modest caravansery, were set two
or three small tables under a trellis; and, at one
of the tables, he recognized Mrs. Horton.

Mrs. Horton rose with a little gasp of delight
to welcome him, and recognized how his
eyes were ranging in search for an even more
[Pg 337]
important personage while he greeted her. Off
beyond the road, with its low guarding wall of
stone, the mountainside fell away precipitously
to the sea, stretching out below in a limitless
expanse of the bluest blue that our eyes can endure.
The slopes were thickly wooded.

       We blew out a tire,        explained Mrs. Horton,
       and Duska is exploring somewhere over
the wall there. I was content to sit here and
wait       but you are younger,        she added with a
smile.        I won       t keep you here.       

From inside the tavern came the tinkle of
guitars, from everywhere in the clear crystalline
air hung the perfume of roses. Marston, with
quick apologies, hastened across the road,
vaulted the wall, and began his search. It was
a brief one, for, turning into a clearing, he saw
her below him on a ledge. She stood as
straight and slim and gracefully erect as the
lancelike young trees.

He made his way swiftly down the slope, and
she had not turned nor heard his approach.
He went straight to her, and took her in his
arms.

The girl wheeled with a little cry of recognition
[Pg 338]
and delight; then, after a moment, she held
him off at arms        length, and looked at him.
Her eyes were deep, and needed no words.
About them was all the world and all the beauty
of it.

Finally, she laughed with the old, happy
laugh.

       Once,        she said very slowly,        you quoted
poetry to me       a verse about the young queen       s
crowning. Do you remember?       

He nodded.

       But that doesn       t apply now,        he assured
her.        You are going to crown me with an undeserved
and unspeakable crown.       

       Quote it to me now,        she commanded, with
reinstated autocracy.

For a moment, the man looked into her face
as the sun struck down on its delicate color,
under the softness of hat and filmy automobile
veil; then, clasping her very close, he whispered
the lines:



       Beautiful, bold and browned,
Bright-eyed out of the battle,
The young queen rode to be crowned.       



       Do you remember some other lines in the
[Pg 339]
same verse?        she questioned, in a voice that
made his throbbing pulses bound faster; but,
before he could answer, she went on:



              Then the young queen answered swift,
       We hold it crown of our crowning, to take our crown for a gift.                     



They turned together, and started up the
slope.




Transcriber's Note:

Minor punctuation and typographic errors have been corrected.

Hyphenation and accent usage have been made consistent.

Page 180 had the word 'excusive'. This may be a typographic
error for either exclusive or excursive. In the context, exclusive
seemed more appropriate, and has been used       "Unless there were a
traitor in very exclusive and carefully guarded councils, ..."

A table of contents has been added for the convenience of the reader.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
