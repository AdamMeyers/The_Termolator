March 5, 1869.


Mr.      Anthony asked, and by unanimous consent obtained, leave to bring in
the following bill; which was read twice, and ordered to be printed.





A BILL

To provide stationery for Congress and the several departments, and for
other purposes.



  1Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
  2of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
  3That upon the passage of this act the heads of each of the
  4executive and judicial departments at Washington, District of
  5Columbia, shall immediately cause estimates to be made of
  6the amount of stationery and other articles which will be
  7required by them for the ensuing year, which are now furnished
  8as stationery or under stationery contracts, and forward
  9the same to the Congressional Printer, who shall immediately
 10issue proposals for such articles and stationery and make
 11purchases of the same, in the manner and under the regulations
 12            provided for in this act.


  1Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That the  ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'Congressionl'">Congressional
  2Printer shall, at the beginning of each session of Congress,
[p span
 class="pgmark">2] br
 />  3submit to the Joint Committee on Public Printing estimates
  4of the quantity of paper, of all descriptions, which will, in his
  5opinion, be required for the public printing during the ensuing
  6year; and also estimates of the quantity and articles of
  7stationery required for each and all of the executive and judicial
  8departments at Washington, and for the Senate and House of
  9Representatives and the Congressional printing office.


  1Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That the heads of
  2the several executive and judicial departments, and the Secretary
  3of the Senate and Clerk of the House of Representatives,
  4shall, on or before the twentieth day of November, in
  5each year, furnish, or cause to be furnished, to the Congressional
  6Printer estimates of the articles and the quantity of each
  7which will be required for their several departments for the
  8year following.

  1Sec. 4. And be it further enacted, That the Joint Committee
  2on Public Printing shall then fix upon standards of
  3paper for the different descriptions of public printing, and for
  4all stationery and articles required, and the Congressional
  5Printer shall, under their direction, advertise in two newspapers
  6published in each of the cities of Boston, New York,
  7Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, and Cincinnati, and in
  8any other city where in their judgment it may become necessary,
  9for sealed proposals to furnish the government with
 10paper and all other articles of the quality and in the quantities
[p span
 class="pgmark">3] br
 /> 11specified in the advertisement, which shall specify the
 12quantity and quality of all the articles required; and he shall
 13furnish to the applicants samples of the standard articles
 14which have been adopted.

  1Sec. 5. And be it further enacted, That the advertisements
  2for sealed proposals shall specify the minimum portion
  3of each article required for either three months, six months,
  4or one year, as the Joint Committee on Public Printing may
  5determine; but when the minimum portion so specified exceeds
  6in any case one thousand reams of paper, the advertisements
  7shall state that proposals will be received for one
  8thousand reams or more.

  1Sec. 6. And be it further enacted, That all sealed proposals
  2to furnish any article shall be opened in the presence
  3of the Joint Committee on Printing, and the contracts shall be
  4awarded by the committee to the lowest and best bidder for
  5each article or class for the interest of the government; but
  6they shall not consider any proposal which is not accompanied
  7by satisfactory evidence that the person making it is a manufacturer
  8or dealer in the articles which he proposes to furnish,
  9and the said joint committee shall, in their award of each contract,
 10allow and designate a reasonable time for filling it.

  1Sec. 7. And be it further enacted, That no contract
  2for furnishing paper or any other article shall be valid until it
  3has been approved by said joint committee, (if made under
[p span
 class="pgmark">4] br
 />  4their direction, or by the Secretary of the Interior, if made
  5under his direction,) according to the provisions of section
  6nine.

  1Sec. 8. And be it further enacted, That the Congressional
  2Printer shall compare all articles delivered by any contractor
  3with the standard of quality, and shall not accept any
  4article which does not conform to it; and in case of a difference
  5of opinion between the Congressional Printer and any
  6contractor with respect to the quality of any article furnished,
  7the matter of difference shall be determined by the Joint Committee
  8on Printing, or in the recess of Congress by the Secretary
  9of the Interior.

  1Sec. 9. And be it further enacted, That in default of
  2any contractor to furnish the articles contracted for at the
  3proper time, or of the proper quality or weight, the Congressional
  4Printer shall report such default to the Joint Committee
  5on Public Printing if Congress is in session, or to the
  6Secretary of the Interior if Congress is not in session; and
  7he shall, under the direction of the Joint Committee on
  8Public Printing, or of the Secretary of the Interior, as the
  9case may be, enter into a new contract with the lowest and
 10best bidder for the interest of the government among those
 11whose proposals were rejected at the last opening of bids, or
 12he shall advertise for new proposals, under the regulations
 13concerning advertisements for proposals hereinbefore stated;
[p span
 class="pgmark">5] br
 /> 14and during the interval which may thus occur he shall, under
 15the direction of the Joint Committee on Public Printing, or
 16of the Secretary of the Interior, as above provided, purchase
 17in open market, at the lowest market price, all such articles
 18necessary for use.

  1Sec. 10. And be it further enacted, That in case of any
  2contractor's default to comply with this contract he and his
  3securities shall be charged with and held responsible for any
  4increase of cost to the government in procuring the supply
  5which may be consequent upon such default.

  1Sec. 11. And be it further enacted, That when any
  2such default occurs the Congressional Printer shall report it,
  3with a full statement of all the facts in the case, to the
  4Solicitor of the Treasury, who shall prosecute the defaulting
  5contractor and his securities upon their bond in the circuit
  6court of the United States in the district in which such
  7defaulting contractor resides.

  1Sec. 12. And be it further enacted, That the Joint
  2Committee on Public Printing, or during the recess of Congress
  3the Secretary of the Interior, may authorize the Congressional
  4Printer to make purchases in open market whenever,
  5in their opinion, the quantity required is so small, or the
  6want is so immediate, as not to justify advertisement for proposals
  7and the award of a contract therefor.

  1Sec. 13. And be it further enacted, That the Congressional
[p span
 class="pgmark">6] br
 />  2Printer shall charge himself in a book, to be kept for
  3that purpose, with all paper and other articles or material
  4received for the public use, and he shall furnish the same to
  5the foremen of printing and binding, and to the officers of
  6the executive and judicial departments, and of the Senate and
  7House of Representatives authorized to receive them, on
  8their written requisitions as the public service may require
  9them, taking a receipt from each officer for such article, which
 10shall be entered to his credit; and accounts shall be kept
 11with each department, and all articles delivered charged to
 12them. And to carry out the provisions of this act the
 13Congressional Printer may employ one clerk of the fourth class,
 14one of the second class, and one messenger, and shall give an
 15additional bond of forty thousand dollars, and receive, in
 16addition to his present salary, one thousand dollars.

  1Sec. 14. And be it further enacted, That from and
  2after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful to make further
  3contracts or purchases or payment for any stationery
  4or article furnished as such, except under existing contracts
  5and in accordance with the regulations hereinbefore  ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
