PREFACE


This volume represents an effort in the direction of
what may be called the biographical history of electricity.
The controlling idea in its preparation was to
provide brief yet reasonably complete sketches of the
lives of the great pioneer workers in electricity, the
ground-breaking investigators who went distinctly beyond
the bounds of what was known before their time,
not merely to add a fringe of information to previous
knowledge, but to make it easy for succeeding generations
to reach conclusions in electrical science that would
have been quite impossible until their revealing work
was done. The lives of these men are not only interesting
as scientific history, but especially as human documents,
showing the sort of men who are likely to make
great advances in science and, above all, demonstrating
what the outlook of such original thinkers was on all the
great problems of the world around us.

In recent times, many people have come to accept the
impression that modern science leads to such an exclusive
occupation with things material, that scientists
almost inevitably lose sight of the deeper significance of
the world of mystery in which humanity finds itself
placed on this planet. The lives of these great pioneers
in electricity, however, do not lend the slightest evidence
in confirmation of any such impression. They were all
of them firm believers in the existence of Providence, of
a Creator, of man's responsibility for his acts to that
Creator, and of a hereafter of reward and punishment
where the sanction of responsibility shall be fulfilled.
Besides, they were men characterized by some of the
best qualities in human nature. Their fellows liked
them for their unselfishness, for their readiness to help
others, for their devotedness to their work and to their
duties as teachers, citizens and patriots. Almost without
exception, they were as far above the average of
mankind in their personal ethics as they were in their
intellectual qualities.

The lives of such men, who were inspiring forces in
their day, are as illuminating as they are instructive and
encouraging. Perhaps never more than now do we need
such inspiration and illumination to lift life to a higher
plane of purpose and accomplishment, than that to which
it is so prone to sink when material interests attract
almost exclusive attention.

MAKERS OF ELECTRICITY.




CHAPTER I.
Peregrinus and Columbus.

The ancients laid down the laws of literary form in
prose as well as in verse, and bequeathed to posterity
works which still serve as models of excellence. Their
poets and historians continue to be read for the sake of
the narrative and beauty of the style; their philosophers
for breadth and depth of thought; and their orators
for judicious analysis and impassioned eloquence.

In the exact sciences, too, the ancients were conspicuous
leaders by reason of the number and magnitude of
the discoveries which they made. You have only to
think of Euclid and his "Elements," of Apollonius and
his Conics, of Eratosthenes and his determination of
the earth's circumference, of Archimedes and his mensuration
of the sphere, and of the inscription on Plato's
Academy, Let none ignorant of geometry enter my door,
to realize the fondness of the Greek mind for abstract
truth and its suppleness and ingenuity in mathematical
investigation.

But the sciences of observation did not advance with
equal pace; nor was this to be expected, as time is an
essential element in experimentation and in the collection
of data, both of which are necessary for the framing
of theories in explanation of natural phenomena.

The slowness of advance is well seen in the development
of the twin subjects of electricity and magnetism.
As to the lodestone, with which we are concerned at present,
the attractive property was the only one known to
ancient philosophy for a period of six hundred years,
from the time of Thales to the age of the Cæsars, when
Lucretius wrote on the nature of things in Latin verse.

Lucretius records the scant magnetic knowledge of
his predecessors and then proceeds to unfold a theory
of his own to account for the phenomena of the wonder-working
stone. Book VI. of "De Natura Rerum"
contains his speculations anent the magnet, together
with certain observations which show that the poet was
not only a thinker, but somewhat of an experimenter as
well. Thus he recognizes magnetic repulsion when he
says: "It happens, too, at times that the substance of
the iron recedes from the stone as if accustomed to start
back from it, and by turns to follow it."

This recognition of the repelling property of the
lodestone is immediately followed by the description of
an experiment which is frequently referred to in works
on magnetic philosophy. It reads: "Thus have I seen
raspings of iron, lying in brazen vessels, thrown into
agitation and start up when the magnet was moved beneath";
or metrically,


And oft in brazen vessels may we mark
Ringlets of Samothrace, or fragments fine
Struck from the valid iron bounding high
When close below, the magnet points its powers.


This experiment, seen and recorded by Lucretius, is
of special interest to the student of magnetic history
because of the use which is made of iron filings and also
because it has led certain writers to credit the poet with
a knowledge of what is known to-day by the various
names of magnetic figures, magnetic curves, magnetic
spectrum. We do not, however, share this view, because
we see no adequate resemblance between the positions
assumed by the bristling particles of iron in the one
case, as described by the Roman poet, and the continuous
symmetrical curves of our laboratories in the other.
If Lucretius noticed such curves in his brazen vessels,
he does not say so; nor does the meagre description of
magnetic phenomena given in Book VI. warrant us in
assuming that he did.

The use of iron filings to map out the entire field of
force that surrounds a magnet was unknown to classical
antiquity; it was not known to Peregrinus or Roger
Bacon in the thirteenth century or even to Gilbert in
the sixteenth. The credit for reviving the use of filings
and employing them to show the direction of the resultant
force at any point in the neighborhood of a magnet,
belongs to Cabeo, an Italian Jesuit, who described and
illustrated it in his "Philosophia Magnetica," published
at Ferrara in the year 1629. On page 316 of that celebrated
work will be found a figure, the first of the
kind, showing the position taken by the filings when
plentifully sifted over a lodestone: thick tufts at the
polar ends with curved lines in the other parts of the
field.

The Samothracian rings mentioned in the passage
quoted above were light, hollow rings of iron which,
for the amusement of the crowd, the jugglers of the
times held suspended one from the other by the power
of a lodestone.

Writing of the lodestone, Lucretius says:


Its viewless, potent virtues men surprise,
Its strange effects, they view with wond'ring eyes,
When without aid of hinges, links or springs
A pendent chain we hold of steely rings.
Dropt from the stone       the stone the binding source       
Ring cleaves to ring and owns magnetic force;
Those held above, the ones below maintain;
Circle 'neath circle downward draws in vain
Whilst free in air disports the oscillating chain.


Though the Roman poet was acquainted with two of
the leading properties of the lodestone, viz., attraction
and repulsion, there is nothing in the lines quoted above
or in any other lines of his great didactic poem to indicate
that he was aware of the remarkable difference
which there is between one end of a lodestone and the
other. The polarity of the magnet, as we term it, was
unknown to him and remained unknown for a period
of 1200 years.

During that long period nothing of importance was
added to the magnetic lore of the world. True, a few
fables were dug out of the tomes of ancient writers
which gained credence and popularity, partly by reason
of the fondness of the human mind for the marvelous,
and partly also by reason of the reputation of the authors
who stood sponsors for them.

Pliny (23-79 A. D.) devotes several pages of his
"Natural History" to the nature and geographical distribution
of various kinds of lodestones, one of which
was said to repel iron just as the normal lodestone
attracts it. Needless to say that the mineral kingdom
does not hold such a stone, although Pliny calls it
theamedes and says that it was found in Ethiopia.


Pliny is responsible for another myth which found
favor with subsequent writers for a long time, when he
says that a certain architect intended to place a mass of
magnetite in the vault of an Alexandrian temple for the
purpose of holding an iron statue of Queen Arsinoe suspended
in mid-air. Of like fabulous character is the
oft-repeated story about Mahomet, that an iron sarcophagus
containing his remains was suspended by means
of the lodestone between the roof of the temple at
Mecca and the ground.

As a matter of fact, Mahomet died at Medina and was
buried there in the ordinary manner, so that the story
as currently told of the suspension of his coffin in the
"Holy City" of Mecca, contains a twofold error, one
of place and the other of position. By a recent (1908)
imperial irade of the Sultan of Turkey, the tomb is lit
up by electric light in a manner that is considered
worthy of the "Prophet of Islam."

Four centuries after Pliny, Claudian, the last of the
Latin poets as he is styled, wrote an idyl of fifty-seven
lines on the magnet, which contains nothing but poetic
generalities. St. Ambrose (340-397) and Palladius (368-430),
writing on the Brahmans of India, tell how certain
magnetic mountains were said to draw iron nails from
passing ships and how wooden pegs were substituted
for nails in vessels going to Taprobane, the modern
Ceylon. St. Augustine (354-430) records in his "De
Civitate Dei" the wonder which he felt in seeing
scraps of iron contained in a silver dish follow every
movement of a lodestone held underneath.


With time, the legendary literature of the magnet
became abundant and in some respects amusing. Thus
we read of the "flesh" magnet endowed with the extraordinary
power of adhering to the skin and even of
drawing the heart out of a man; the "gold" magnet
which would attract particles of the precious metal from
an admixture of sand; the "white" magnet used as a
philter; magnetic unguents of various kinds, one of
which, when smeared over a bald head, would make the
hair grow; magnetic plasters for the relief of headache;
magnetic applications to ease toothaches and dispel
melancholy; magnetic nostrums to cure the dropsy, to
quell disputes and even reconcile husband and wife. No
less fictitious was the pernicious effect on the lodestone
attributed in the early days of the mariner's compass to
onions and garlic; and yet, so deeply rooted was the belief
in this figment that sailors, while steering by the
compass, were forbidden the use of these vegetables
lest by their breath they might intoxicate the "index of
the pole" and turn it away from its true pointing.
More reasonable than this prohibition was the maritime
legislation of certain northern countries for the protection
of the lodestone on shipboard. According to this
penal code, a sailor found guilty of tampering with the
lodestone used for stroking the needles, was to have
the guilty hand held to a mast of the ship by a dagger
thrust through it until, by tearing the flesh away, he
wrenched himself free.

It was only at the time of the Crusades that people
in Europe began to recognize the directive property of
the magnet, in virtue of which a freely suspended compass-needle
takes up a definite position relatively to the
north-and-south line, property which is serviceable to
the traveler on land and supremely useful to the navigator
on sea.


It is commonly said that the compass was introduced
into Europe by the returning Crusaders, who heard of
it from their Mussulman foes. These, in turn, derived
their knowledge from the Chinese, who are credited
with its use on sea as far back as the third century of
our era.[1]

Among the earliest references to the sailing compass
is that of the trouvère Guyot de Provins,[2] who wrote,
about the year 1208, a satirical poem of three thousand
lines, in which the following passage occurs:


The mariners employ an art which cannot deceive.
An ugly stone and brown,
To which iron joins itself willingly
They have; after applying a needle to it,
They lay the latter on a straw
And put it simply in the water
Where the straw makes it float.
Then the point turns direct.
To the star with such certainty
That no man will ever doubt it,
Nor will it ever go wrong.
When the sea is dark and hazy,
That one sees neither star nor moon,
Then they put a light by the needle
And have no fear of losing their way.
The point turns towards the star;
And the mariners are taught
To follow the right way.
It is an art which cannot fail.


The author was a caustic and fearless critic, who
lashed with equal freedom the clergy and laity, nobles
and princes, and even the reigning pontiff himself, all
of whom should be for their subjects, according to the
satirist, what the pole-star is for mariners       a beacon
to guide them over the stormy sea of life.


Guyot traveled extensively in his early years, but
later in life retired from a world which he despised, and
ended his days in the peaceful seclusion of the Benedictine
Abbey of Cluny.

An interesting reference, of a similar nature to that
of the minstrel Guyot, is found in the Spanish code of
laws known as Las Siete Partidas of Alfonso el Sabio,
begun in 1250 and completed in 1257. It says:

"And even as mariners guide themselves in the dark
night by the needle, which is their connecting medium
between the lodestone and the star, and thus shows
them where they go alike in bad seasons as in good; so
those who are to give counsel to the king ought always
to guide themselves by justice, which is the connecting
medium between God and the world, at all times to give
their guerdon to the good and their punishment to the
Wicked, to each according to his deserts."[3]

It will be necessary to give a few more extracts from
writers of the first half of the thirteenth century in
order to show how little was known about the magnet
and how crude were the early appliances used in
navigation when Peregrinus appeared on the scene.

Cardinal Jacques de Vitry, who lived in the East for
some years, wrote his "History of the Orient" between
the years 1215 and 1220, in which he says:

"An iron needle after touching the lodestone, turns
towards the north star, so that such a needle is necessary
for those who navigate the seas."

This passage of the celebrated Cardinal seems to
indicate that even then the compass was widely known
and commonly used in navigation.

Neckam (1157-1217), the Augustinian Abbot of Cirencester,
wrote in his "Utensilibus":


"Among the stores of a ship, there must be a needle
mounted on a dart which will oscillate and turn until the
point looks to the north; the sailors will thus know how
to direct their course when the pole-star is concealed
through the troubled state of the atmosphere."

This passage is of historical value, as it contains what
is probably the earliest known reference to a mounted
or pivoted compass. Prior to the introduction of this
mode of suspension, the needle was floated on a straw,
in a reed, on a piece of cork or a strip of wood, all of
which modes of flotation, when taken in conjunction
with the unsteadiness of the vessel in troubled waters,
must have made observation difficult and unsatisfactory.

Brunetto Latini (1230-1294) makes a passing reference
to the new magnetic knowledge in his "Livres
dou Tresor," which he wrote in 1260, during his exile in
Paris.

"The sailors navigate the seas," he says, "guided
by the two stars called tramontanes; and each of the
two parts of the lodestone directs the end of the needle
that has touched it to the particular star to which that
part of the stone itself turns."

Though a statesman, orator and philosopher of ability,
the preceptor of Dante in Florence and guest of Friar
Bacon in Oxford, Brunetto has not got the philosophy
of the needle quite right in this passage; for the part
that has been touched by the north end of a lodestone
will acquire south polarity and will not, therefore, turn
towards the same "tramontane" as the end of the stone
by which it was touched.

Dante himself admitted the occult influence on the
compass-needle that emanates from the pole-star when
he wrote:


"Out of the heart of one of the new lights
There came a voice that, needle to the star,
Made me appear in turning thitherward.
Paradise, XII., 28-30.


The next writer on the compass is Raymond Lully
(1236-1315), who was noted for his versatility, voluminous
writings and extensive travels as well as for the
zeal which he displayed in converting the African
Moors. Lully writes in his "De Contemplatione":
"As the needle after touching the lodestone, turns to
the north, so the mariners' needle directs them over the
sea."

This brings us to the last of our ante-Peregrinian
writers who make definite allusions to the use of the
compass for navigation purposes, viz., Roger Bacon, one
of the glories of the thirteenth century as he would be
of the twentieth. It was at the request of his patron,
Pope Clement IV., that Bacon wrote his "Opus Majus," a
work in which he treats of all the sciences and in which
he advocates the experimental method as the right one
for the study of natural phenomena and the only one
that will serve to extend the boundaries of human knowledge.
In a section on the magnet, a clear distinction is
drawn between the physical properties of the two ends
of a lodestone; for "iron which has been touched by a
lodestone," he says, "follows the end by which it has
been touched and turns away from the other." Besides
being a recognition of magnetic polarity, this is equivalent
to saying that unlike poles attract while like poles
repel each other. Bacon further remarks, by way of
corroboration, that if a strip of iron be floated in a basin,
the end that was touched by the lodestone will follow
the stone, while the other end will flee from it as a lamb
from the wolf. There is, however, an earlier recognition
known of the polarity of the lodestone; for Abbot
Neckam, fifty years before, called attention to the dual
nature of the physical action of the lodestone, attracting
in one part (say) by sympathy and repelling at the other
by antipathy. It was the common belief in Bacon's
time and for centuries after, that the compass-needle
was directed by the pole-star, often called the sailor's
star; but Bacon himself did not think so, preferring to
believe with Peregrinus, that it was controlled not by
any one star or by any one constellation, but by the
entire celestial sphere. Other contemporaries of his
sought the cause of the directive property not in the
heavens at all, but in the earth itself, attributing it to
hypothetical mines of iron which, naturally enough,
they located in regions situated near the pole. Peregrinus
records this opinion, which he criticises and rejects,
saying in Chapter X. that persons who hold such
a doctrine "are ignorant of the fact that in many different
parts of the globe the lodestone is found; from
which it would follow that the needle should turn in
different directions, according to the locality, which is
contrary to experience." A little further on he gives
his own view, saying: "It is evident from the foregoing
chapters that we must conclude that not only from the
north pole (of the world), but also from the south pole
rather than from the veins of mines, virtue flows into
the poles of the lodestone."

Observations had to accumulate and much experimentation
had to be done before it was finally established
that the cause of the directive property of the magnet
is not to be sought in the remote star depths at all, but
in the earth itself, the whole terrestrial globe acting as
a colossal magnet, partly in virtue of magnetic ore
lying near the surface and partly also in virtue of electrical
currents, due to solar heat, circulating in the crust
of the earth.

Of the early years of Pierre le Pélérin (Petrus Peregrinus),
nothing is known save that he was born of
wealthy parents in Maricourt, a village of Picardy in
Northern France. From his academic title of Magister,
we infer that he received the best instruction available
at the time, probably in the University of Paris, which
was then in the height of its fame. His reputation for
mathematical learning and mechanical skill crossed the
Channel and reached Friar Bacon in the University of
Oxford. In his "Opus Tertium," the Franciscan Friar
records the esteem in which he held his Picard friend,
saying: "I know of only one person who deserves
praise for his work in experimental philosophy, because
he does not care for the discourses of men or their
wordy warfare, but quietly and diligently pursues the
works of wisdom. Therefore it is that what others
grope after blindly, as bats in the evening twilight, this
man contemplates in all their brilliancy because he is
master of experiment."

Continuing the appraisal of his Gallic friend's achievements,
he says: "He knows all natural sciences,
whether pertaining to medicine and alchemy or to matters
celestial and terrestrial. He has worked diligently
in the smelting of ores and also in the working of minerals;
he is thoroughly acquainted with all sorts of arms
and implements used in military service and in hunting,
besides which he is skilled in agriculture and also in the
measurement of lands. It is impossible to write a useful
or correct treatise on experimental philosophy without
mentioning this man's name. Moreover, he pursues
knowledge for its own sake; for if he wished to obtain
royal favor, he could easily find sovereigns to honor and
enrich him."

This is at once a beautiful tribute to the work and
character of Peregrinus and an emphatic recognition of
the paramount importance of laboratory methods for the
advancement of learning. It is evident from such testimony,
coming as it does from an eminent member of
the brotherhood of science, that the world had not to
wait for the advent of Chancellor Bacon or for the publication
of his Novum Organum in 1620, to learn how to
undertake and carry out a scientific research to a reliable
issue. Call the method what you will, inductive,
deductive or both, the method advocated by the Franciscan
friar of the thirteenth century was the one
followed at all times from Archimedes to Peregrinus
and from Peregrinus to Gilbert, none of whom knew
anything of Lord Bacon's pompous phrases and lofty
commendation of the inductive method of inquiry for
the advancement of physical knowledge. Be it said in
passing, that Bacon, eminent as he undoubtedly was in
the realm of the higher philosophy, was, nevertheless,
neither a mathematician nor a man of science; he never
put to a practical test the rules which he laid down with
such certitude and expectancy for the guidance of physical
inquiry. Moreover, there is not a single discovery
in science made during the three centuries that have
elapsed since the promulgation of the Baconian doctrine
that can be ascribed to it; it has been steadily ignored
by men renowned in the world for their scientific
achievements and has been absolutely barren of results.

Peregrinus, on the other hand, does not stop to enumerate
opinions, he does not even quote Aristotle; but he
experiments, observes, reasons and draws conclusions
which he puts to the further test of experiment before
finally accepting them. Then and then only does he
rise from the order of the physicist to that of the
philosopher, from correlating facts and phenomena to
the discovery of the laws which govern them and the
causes that produce them. Furthermore, he was in no
hurry to let the world know that he was grinding lodestones
one day and pivoting compass-needles the next;
what he cared for supremely was to discover facts, new
phenomena, new methods. Peregrinus was not an essayist,
nor was he a man of mere book-learning. He
was a clear-headed thinker, a close and resourceful
worker, a man who preferred facts to phrases and observation
to speculation.

At one period of his life, Master Peter applied his ingenuity
to the solution of a problem in practical optics,
involving the construction of a burning-mirror of large
dimensions somewhat after the manner of Archimedes;
but though he spent three years on the enterprise and a
correspondingly large sum of money, we are not told by
Friar Bacon, who mentions the fact, what measure of
success was achieved. Bacon, however, avails himself
of the occasion to insinuate a possible cause of failure,
for he says that nothing is difficult of accomplishment
to his friend unless it be for want of means.

Centuries later, the French naturalist Buffon took up
the same optical problem, with a view to showing that
the feat attributed to Archimedes during the siege of
Syracuse by the Romans was not impossible of accomplishment.
For this purpose, he used 168 small mirrors
in the construction of a large concave reflector, with
which he ignited wood at a distance of 150 feet and
succeeded in melting lead at a distance of 140 feet. As
this was done in the winter time in Paris, it was concluded
that it would have been quite possible to set a
Roman trireme on fire from a safe distance by the concentrated
energy of a Sicilian sun.

If Peregrinus was alert in mind, he appears to have
been very active in body. Prompted, no doubt, by the
higher motives of Christian faith and perhaps a little,
too, by his fondness for travel and adventure, he took
the cross in early life and joined one of the crusading
expeditions of the time. That he went to the land of
the paynim, we have no direct evidence; but we infer
the fact from the title of Peregrinus or Pilgrim, by
which he is known, his full name being Pierre le Pélérin
de Maricourt, or, in the Latinized form, Petrus Peregrinus
de Maricourt.

In 1269, we find him engaged in a military expedition
undertaken by Charles Duke of Anjou, for the purpose
of bringing back to his allegiance as King of the Two
Sicilies the revolted city of Lucera in Southern Italy.
He served in what might be called the engineering
corps of the army, and was engaged in fortifying the
camp and constructing engines of defense and attack.
Unlike his companions in arms, Peregrinus does not
allow himself to be wholly absorbed with military duties,
nor does he waste his leisure hours in frivolous amusements;
his mind is on higher things; he is engrossed
with a problem in practical mechanics which required
him to devise a piece of mechanism that would keep an
armillary sphere in motion for a time.

In outlining the necessary mechanism, as he conceived
it, he was gradually led to consider the general and more
fascinating problem of perpetual motion itself, with the
result that he waxed somewhat enthusiastic when he
thought that he saw the possibility of constructing an
ever-turning wheel in which the motive power would be
magnetic attraction, the attraction of a lodestone for a
number of iron teeth arranged at equal distances on the
periphery of a wheel. The device looked well on paper,
beyond which stage it was not carried, perhaps for
want of leisure, or more probably for want of the necessary
material and tools. Had Peregrinus been able to
test his theoretical views on the magnetic motor by
actual experiment, the delusive character of perpetual
motion would have been recognized at an early epoch in
the world's history, and much time and money spared
for more profitable investment.

This very wheel, which was designed in the trenches
before Lucera in 1269, was probably the cause of the
withering rebuke which Justin Huntly McCarthy administers
in his "History of the French Revolution,"
Vol. I., p. 256, where he says: "In the long record of
rascaldom from Peregrinus to Bamfylde Moore Carew,
no single rascal stands forward with such magnificent
effrontery, such majestic impudence, such astonishing
success as Cagliostro." To say the least, this is a very
serious slip of the pen on the part of the Irish historian
of the French Revolution, in which a scientific pioneer
of the first rank and a patriot of exalted type is mistaken
for a charlatan of the deepest dye.

Although Peregrinus puts the burden of constructing
his wheel on others, he does not appear to have considered
it a vain conceit; for, in the beginning of the last
chapter of the "Epistola" he says: "In this chapter,
I will make known to you the construction of a wheel
which, in a remarkable manner, moves continuously."
He is writing from Southern Italy to his friend Siger
(Syger, Sygerus), at home in Picardy; and that this
friend may the better comprehend the mechanism of the
wheel, he proceeds to describe in a systematic manner the
various properties of the lodestone, all of which he had
investigated and many of which he had discovered.
The "Epistola" of Peregrinus is, therefore, the first
treatise on the magnet ever written; it stands as the
first great landmark in magnetic philosophy.

The work is divided into two parts       the
first contains ten chapters and the latter
three. "At your request," he says to his
friend, "I will make known to you in
an unpolished narrative the undoubted
though hidden virtue of the lodestone,
concerning which philosophers, up to the
present time, give us no information. Out
of affection for you, I will write in simple
style about things entirely unknown
to the ordinary individual."



Fig. 1
The Double Pivoted Needle of Petrus Peregrinus, A.D., 1269


After this declaration as to the original character of
his work Peregrinus proceeds: "You must know that
whoever wishes to experiment should be acquainted
with the nature of things; he must also be skilled in
manipulation, in order that by means of this stone, he
may produce those marvelous results."

The titles of the chapters will give an idea of the
comprehensive character of the magnetic work accomplished
by the author and, at the same time, will serve
to show how much was known about the lodestone in
the thirteenth century.


PART I.

Chap. I. Purpose of this work.
II. Qualifications of the experimenter.
III. Characteristics of a good lodestone.
IV. How to distinguish the poles of a lodestone.
V. How to tell which pole is north and which south.
VI. How one lodestone attracts another.
VII. How iron touched by a lodestone turns towards the
poles of the world.
VIII. How a lodestone attracts iron.
IX. Why the north pole of one lodestone attracts the south
pole of another, and vice versa.
X. An inquiry into the natural virtue of the lodestone.

PART II.

Chap. I. Construction of an instrument for measuring the azimuth
of the sun, the moon or any star when in
the horizon.
II. Construction of a better instrument for the same purpose.
III. The art of making a wheel of perpetual motion.


An attentive reading of the thirteen chapters of this
treatise of 3,500 words will show that:

(1) Peregrinus assigns a definite position to what he
calls the poles of a lodestone and gives practical directions
for determining which is north and which south.

(2) He establishes the two fundamental laws of magnetism,
that like poles repel and unlike poles attract
each other.

(3) He demonstrates by experiment that every fragment
of a lodestone is a complete magnet, and shows
how the fragments should be put together in order to
reproduce the polarity of the unbroken stone.

(4) He shows how a pole of a lodestone may neutralize
a weaker one of the same name and even reverse
its polarity.

(5) He pivots a magnetized needle and surrounds
it with a circle divided into 360 degrees.

This brief summary shows the great advance made
by the author on what was known about the lodestone
before his time. Most of the salient facts in magnetism
are clearly described and some of their applications
pointed out. So thorough and complete was this apprehension
and explanation of magnetic phenomena that
nothing of importance was added to it for the next
three hundred years.



Fig. 2
First Pivoted Compass, Peregrinus, 1269


In the compass which Peregrinus devised for use in
navigation, a light magnetic needle was thrust through
a slender vertical axis made of wood, which axis also
carried a pointer of brass or silver at right angles to
the needle. According to the belief of the time, the
magnetic needle gave the north and south points of the
horizon, while the brass pointer determined the east and
west points. This compass, double pivoted be it noticed,
was provided with a graduated circle and a
movable arm, having a pair of upright pins at its
extremities, which movable arm enabled the navigator
to determine the magnetic bearing of the sun, moon or
any star at the time of rising or setting. "By means
of this instrument," the author says in Chap. II., "you
can direct your course towards cities and islands and
any other place wherever you may wish to go, by land
or by sea, provided you know the latitude and longitude
of the place which you want to reach."

The invention of the compass has been attributed to
one Flavio Gioja, a seafaring man of Amalfi, a flourishing
maritime town in Southern Italy. If we admit that
Gioja was a real and not a fictitious person, we cannot,
however, admit the claim which is made by his countrymen,
when they say that he gave to the mariner the
use of the compass in the year 1302; for we have seen
that Peregrinus distinctly states that his compass, described
in 1269, could be relied upon for guidance by the
traveler on land as well as by the voyager on sea.

To Gioja may belong the merit of having simplified and
improved the compass. It is likely that he suspended
the needle on one pivot instead of the two used by
Peregrinus, and that he added the compass-card with
its thirty-two divisions, attaching it to the needle itself,
thereby adding materially to the practical character of
the compass as a nautical instrument.

On the other hand, a claim has been made for Peregrinus
which cannot be admitted. It was put forward
by his itinerant countryman Thévenot, in the seventeenth
century, to the effect that the author of the
"Epistola" was acquainted with magnetic declination,
in virtue of which a freely suspended magnet does not
point north and south, but cuts the geographical meridian
at a definite angle.

Writing in 1681, Thévenot says in his "Recueil de
Voyages" that: "It was a matter of general belief
down to the present day, that the declination of the
magnetic needle was first observed sometime in the
beginning of the last (16th) century. I have found,
however, that there was a declination of five degrees in
the year 1269, having found it recorded in a manuscript
with the title "Epistola Petri Adsigerii," etc.

The title of the manuscript seen by Thévenot is not,
however, as he gives it above, but "Epistola Petri ad
Sygerium," etc., which is quite a different reading.

There are twenty-eight manuscript copies of the
"Epistola" known to exist; and only one of them, that
of the University of Leyden, contains the passage alluded
to by Thévenot. This manuscript was the object of
careful study and critical examination by Wenckebach
(1865) and other competent scholars, who pronounced
it a spurious addition made some time in the early part
of the 16th century.[4]

In the time of Peregrinus, it is probable that the declination
did not exceed three degrees in Paris or on the
shores of the Mediterranean, a quantity so small that it
would have been difficult of detection; and, if detected,
would have been attributed either to errors in the construction
of the instrument used or to inaccuracy on the
part of the observer. This is what happened to Columbus
when, on his return to Spain, having reported the
many and definite observations on the variation of the
compass which he had made on
his outward voyage, he was told
by the learned ones of the day
that he was in error and not the
needle, because the latter was
everywhere true to the pole.

This oft-stated and widely-believed
fidelity of the needle to
the pole is not, however, founded
on fact; it is the exception, the
rare exception, not the rule,
despite the couplet of the poet:


Th' obedient steel with living instinct moves
And veers for ever to the pole it loves;


or this other,


So turns the faithful needle to the pole,
Though mountains rise between and oceans roll.




Fig. 3
Magnetic Declination at New York, 1907 (Left) and at San Francisco, 1907 (Right)


That the magnet does not turn to the pole of the
world is common knowledge to-day, when the High
School tyro will tell you that in New York it points 9°
west of north, while in San Francisco it points 15° east
of north. If he happens to be well up, he may refer
to the position of the agonic line on the globe along
which the needle stands true to the pole, while all
places to the east of that line in our hemisphere have
westerly declination and those to the west have easterly
declination. Indeed, magnetic charts show places
where the needle points east and west instead of north
and south, and others where the north-seeking end
points directly south. Such varying and conflicting
behavior of the compass-needle serves to show the irregular
manner in which the earth's magnetism is distributed
and also the intensity of distributing forces
which exist at certain places.

It is one of the gems in the crown of Columbus, that
he observed, measured and recorded this strange behavior
of the magnetic needle in his narrative of the
voyage. True, he did not notice it until he was far out
on the trackless ocean. A week had elapsed since he
left the lordly Teneriffe, and a few days since the
mountainous outline of Gomera had disappeared from
sight. The memorable night was that of September 13th,
1492. There was no mistaking it; the needle of the
Santa Maria pointed a little west of north instead of due
north. Some days later, on September 17th, the pilots,
having taken the sun's amplitude, reported that the
variation had reached a whole point of the compass, the
alarming amount of 11 degrees.

The surprise and anxiety
which Columbus manifested on
those occasions may be taken as
indications that the phenomenon
was new to him. As a matter
of fact, however, his needles
were not true even at the outset
of the voyage from the port
of Palos, where, though no one
was aware of it, they pointed
about 3° east of north. This
angle diminished from day to
day as the Admiral kept the
prow of his caravel directed to the west, until it vanished
altogether, after which the needles veered to the
west, and kept moving westward for a time as the flag-ship
proceeded on her voyage.




Fig. 4
Magnetic Declination in London in 1580 and in 1907


Columbus thus determined a place on the Atlantic
in which the magnetic meridian coincided with the
geographical and in which the needle stood true to the
pole. Six years later, in 1498, Sebastian Cabot found
another place on the same ocean, a little further north,
in which the compass lay exactly in the north-and-south
line. These two observations, one by Columbus
and the other by Cabot, sufficed to determine the position
of the agonic line, or line of no variation, for that
locality and epoch.

The Columbian line acquired at once considerable importance,
in the geographical and the political world,
because of the proposal that was made to discard the
Island of Ferro and take it for the prime meridian from
which longitude would be reckoned east and west, and
also because it was selected by Pope Alexander VI. to
serve as a line of reference in settling the rival claims
of the kingdoms of Portugal and Castile with regard to
their respective discoveries. It was decided that all recently
discovered lands lying to the east of that line
should belong to Portugal; and those to the west, to
Castile.

The line of no variation, like all other isomagnetic
lines, has shifted its position with time, so that it runs
to-day considerably to the west of the place assigned to
it by Columbus in 1492 and by the Papal Bull of the
following year.

Columbus did not speak of the disquieting observation
which he made on the night of the 13th of September;
he thought of it, and wondered greatly what might
be the cause of such an unexpected and untoward phenomenon.
His silence on the matter did not avail, for
the keen-eyed sailors noticed the westerly deflection of
the needle when, after a few days, it became quite
apparent. They grew alarmed, believing that the laws
of nature were changing as they advanced farther and
farther into the unknown. It was a trying moment for
the Admiral, but his ingenuity and tactfulness rose to
the occasion. He told his seamen that the needle did
not point to the cynosure or last star in the tail of the
Little Bear, as commonly supposed, but to a fixed point
in the celestial sphere at which there was no star, adding
that the "cynosure" itself, the Polaris of our days,
was not stationary, but had a rotational movement of its
own like all other heavenly bodies.

We do not know what Columbus thought of his explanation,
born of the stress of the moment, but the esteem
in which he was held by pilots and sailors alike for his
knowledge of astronomy and cosmography led them to
accept it. Their fears were allayed, a mutiny was
averted and a successful termination to their voyage
rendered possible.

Captains of ocean-liners would give to-day a different
answer to a passenger who might consult them about
the splinter of steel which serves to guide their fleet
vessels in darkest nights, through howling tempests and
over billowy seas. The mysterious influence that controls
it, they would say, comes neither from Polaris nor
the pole of the world, nor from the heavens above, but
from the earth beneath.

Such an explanation was not thought of until it was
clearly shown a hundred years later that this globe of
ours acts like a colossal lodestone, controlling every magnet
in our laboratories and observatories, and every
needle on board the merchantmen and fighting-monsters
that plough our seas and oceans.

Without any intuition of modern theory, Columbus
made two discoveries in terrestrial magnetism, as we
have seen, each of fundamental importance, whether
considered from the view-point of pure science or that
of practical navigation, viz., (a) that the needle is not
true to the pole and (b) that the angular displacement
of the needle from true orientation, the variation of the
compass, as it is called in nautical parlance, differs with
the place of the observer. These two discoveries as well
as the location of a place of no variation on the Atlantic
Ocean entitle Columbus to a prominent place among the
founders of the science of terrestrial magnetism.

Later observers discovered that even for a given place
this element of magnetic declination has not a constant
value, but undergoes changes which complete their
cycle, some in a day, others in a year, and others again
in centuries. The last or secular change in the direction
of the magnetic needle was discovered by Gellibrand, of
London, in 1634 (published in 1635); the annual, by
Cassini, at Paris, 1782-1791; and the diurnal, by Graham,
of London, in 1722.

The first observation of magnetic declination on land
appears to have been made about the year 1510 by
George Hartmann (1489-1564), Vicar of the Church of
St. Sebald in Nuremberg, who found it to be 6° east in
Rome, where he was living at the time. Hartmann's
observation of the declination in Rome and also in
Nuremberg, where the needle pointed 10° east of north,
will be found in a letter which he wrote in 1544 to Duke
Albert of Prussia and which remained unpublished until
the year 1831.

Returning to the treatise of Peregrinus on the magnet,
it should be said that for several centuries the twenty-eight
manuscript copies lay undisturbed on the dusty
shelves of city and university libraries. In 1562, four
years after the appearance of the first printed edition
(Augsburg, 1558), Taisnier, a Belgian writer on magnetics,
who is also described as poet-laureate and Doctor
"utriusque juris," was among the earliest to discover
the "Epistola," from which he copied extensively in his
little quarto on the magnet and its effects, thus showing
that there were literary pirates in those days. It was
also well known to Gilbert, to Cabeo and Kircher; but
despite the references of these writers, the "Epistola"
remained practically unknown until Cavallo, of London,
called attention to the Leyden manuscript in the third
edition of his "Treatise on Magnetism,"[5] 1800, by giving
part of the text and accompanying it with a
translation.

Later, in 1838, Libri, historian of the mathematical
sciences in Italy, gave excerpts from the Paris codex
with translation; but the scholar who contributed most
of all to make the work of Peregrinus known is the
Italian Barnabite, Timoteo Bertelli, who published in
1868 a critical study of the various manuscripts of the
letter, principally those which he found in Rome and in
Florence, adding copious notes of historic, bibliographic
and scientific value. Father Bertelli was Professor of
Physics in the Collegio della Quercia, in Florence, where
he took an active interest in Italian seismology besides
carrying on investigations in meteorology, telegraphy
and electricity. Born in Bologna in 1826, he died in
Florence in March, 1905.

The following list of manuscript copies of the "Epistola"
is taken from a scholarly paper by Professor
Silvanus P. Thompson, of London, which appeared in
the "Proceedings of the British Academy" for 1906:

The first printed edition of the "Epistola" was prepared
for the press in 1558 by Achilles Gasser, a man
well versed in the science and philosophy of his day;
another edition, which will probably be considered the
textus receptus, is that which was prepared and published
by Bertelli in 1868.

No complete translation in any language of this historical
work on magnetism was made until 1902, when
Prof. Silvanus P. Thompson, of London, published his
"Epistle of Peter Peregrinus of Maricourt to Sygerus
of Foncaucourt, soldier, concerning the Magnet." Unfortunately,
this translation was printed for private circulation
and limited to 250 copies. Two years later,
1904, Brother Arnold, F. S. C., presented a memoir on
Peregrinus, including a translation of the "Epistola,"
for the M. Sc. degree of Manhattan College, New York
City, which translation was published some months later
by the McGraw Publishing Company, New York. These
are the only complete translations of the "Letter" of
Peregrinus on the Magnet which have yet appeared.

CHAPTER II.
Norman and Gilbert.


We have seen that in the thirteenth century the
directive property of the lodestone was recognized by
Peregrinus and used by him in his pivoted compass;
and that in the fifteenth, Columbus discovered magnetic
declination on sea as well as its variation with place.

The next cardinal fact in terrestrial magnetism, magnetic
dip, was discovered in 1576 by Robert Norman, a
compass-maker of Limehouse, London. Norman possessed
many of the fine qualities of mind, hand and
disposition that are indispensable in the make-up of the
original investigator. In pivoting his compass-needles,
he soon noticed that, however carefully
they were balanced before being
magnetized, they did not remain horizontal
after magnetization, the north-seeking
end always going down
through a small angle. He next had
the happy idea of swinging a needle on
a horizontal axis, so that it might be
free to move up and down in a vertical
plane, with the result that the
north-seeking end again went down
through a constant but much greater
angle.

The First Dip-Circle, Invented by Norman in 1576


Like declination, the first discovered
of the three magnetic elements, the dip was found to
vary with place on the earth's surface, being 0° at the
magnetic equator and 90° at either pole. It was with a
Norman dip-circle, greatly improved, that Ross in 1831
found the north magnetic pole of the earth to be in Boothia
Felix in latitude 70° 5'.3 N., and longitude 96° 45'.8 W.;
and it was with a similar instrument that Amundsen
recently studied the magnetic conditions of that Arctic
region, the exact location of the pole itself being finally
determined by an earth-inductor or spinning coil of the
latest make. Though the results of his observations
have not yet been made public, it is generally known
that they indicate a spot for the magnetic pole close to
that found by Sir James Ross. It is not expected, however,
that the location of the pole by the Norwegian
Commander shall exactly coincide with that of the
English Captain, because the magnetic pole is believed
to have nomadic tendencies of its own like our geographical
pole, only much more pronounced in magnitude.
After moving westward for some time at the
rate of a mile per year, it retraced its steps and is now
back again in the vicinity of its starting place.

Besides his dip-circle, Norman also devised a simple
and very apt illustration of magnetic inclination. Thrusting
a steel needle through a round piece of cork, he
pared the latter down until the system, consisting of
the needle and the cork, sank to a certain depth in a
glass vessel containing water, and there took up a horizontal
position. The needle was next removed from
the water and magnetized with great care, so as not to
disturb its position in the cork. When placed again in
the water, the needle sank to its former depth and
settled down at an angle of 71° to the horizon.

The same illustration shows another experiment
which Norman made in order to determine whether
the earth exerts a force of translation on a magnet, in
virtue of which the magnet would tend to move bodily
toward the pole. For this purpose, he floated a magnetized
piece of steel wire on the surface of the water
and noticed that, wherever placed,
it merely swung round into the
magnetic meridian without showing
any tendency to move northward
or southward toward the
rim of the vessel. Hartmann, who
observed the declination of the
needle on land as stated on p. 26,
appears also to have been the first
to notice magnetic inclination. Having
balanced a steel needle with
great precision, he found that, after
magnetization, it did not remain
horizontal, the north-seeking end
invariably dipping through an angle of 9°. The smallness
of the angle in this experiment was due to the fact
that the needle used by the Nuremberg Vicar could move
only in a horizontal plane, whereas Norman's was free
to move in a vertical circle. Had Hartmann used such a
device, he would have obtained more than 60° for the dip
instead of the 9° which he records.

Norman's Illustration of Magnetic Dip


As already remarked, the letter in which Hartmann
consigns these capital observations was written in 1544,
but was not published until the third decade of the
nineteenth century, so that Norman has clearly the full
merit of independent discovery.

In the directions which Norman gives for making
observations of dip, he states explicitly that the instrument
must be adjusted "duley according to the variation
of the place," which means that the plane of the
circle must be turned into what was called after his
time "the magnetic meridian."

The discovery of magnetic dip led Norman to discard
the view generally held in his time, which placed the
controlling influence of the compass-needle in far-off
celestial space; for he says that the poynt respective
which the magnet indicates, but to which it is not bodily
drawn, is not in the heavens above, but in the earth
itself. His words are: "And by the declining of the
needle is also proved that the poynt respective is rather
in the earth than in the heavens, as some have imagined;
and the greatest reason why they so thought,
as I judge, was because they were never acquainted
with this declining in the needle."

Here we have a radical departure from the scientific
creed of the time, a notable advance in scientific theory,
an entirely new philosophy founded by Norman, the
compass-maker, and greatly developed twenty-four
years later by his fellow-citizen,
Gilbert, the
physician.





Fig. 7
Gilbert's Orb of Virtue, 1600


Norman made another
remark of great importance
in the new philosophy,
the justness of
which was appreciated
by Gilbert, his contemporary,
but more so by
Faraday and Clerk
Maxwell, two centuries
later. It refers to the space surrounding a magnet,
natural or artificial, which cubical space Gilbert, following
Norman, called an orb of virtue. That the influence
or "effluvium" of the magnet extends throughout the
entire space may readily be seen by carrying a compass-needle
round a magnet from point to point, far away
as well as close by. The phrase "orb of virtue," or
sphere of magnetic influence, appears to describe the
actual magnetic condition of the space in question more
pertinently than our modern equivalent of "magnetic
field."

The words of Norman are very remarkable: "I am
of opinion that if this vertue could by anie means be
made visible to the eie of man, it would be found in a
sphericall forme, extending round about the stone in
great compasse and the dead bodie of the stone in the
middle thereof." The lines which immediately follow
this statement, pregnant with significance, show the
deep religious feeling of the author. They read: "and
this I have partly proved and made visible to be seene
in some manner, and God sparing mee life, I will herein
make further experience and that not curiouslie but in
the feare of God as neere as He shall give me grace and
meane to annexe the same unto a booke of navigation
which I have had long in hand."       Chap. VIII.

It is evident from the pages of the Newe Attractive
(1581) that Norman was animated with the right spirit
of inquiry, which is calm, deliberate and judicious,
which leads to the discovery of facts, to their coordination
and experimental illustration before explanations
are thought of and long before new theories are propounded.
The style in which this little treatise is
written has a charm of its own, mainly by reason of its
quaintness. At the end of his address to the candid
reader, which, after the manner of the times, was
somewhat belabored and rhetorical in character, Norman
breaks away from common inadequate prose; and,
giving wings to his imagination, writes a lyric on the
magnet which is the first metrical composition in English
that we have on such a subject. It reads:       


THE MAGNES OR LOADSTONE'S CHALLENGE.

Give place ye glittering sparks,
ye glimmering Diamonds bright,
Ye Rubies red, and Saphires brave
wherein ye most delight.

In breefe, yee stones inricht,
and burnisht all with golde,
Set forth in Lapidaries shops,
for Jewells to be sold.

Give place, give place I say,
your beautie, gleame and glee,
Is all the vertue for the which,
accepted so you bee.

Magnes, the Loadstone I,
your painted sheath defie,
Without my help in Indian seas,
the best of you might lie.

I guide the Pilot's course,
his helping hand I am,
The Mariner delights in me,
so doth the Marchant man.

My vertue lies unknowne,
my secrets hidden are,
By me, the Court and Commonweale,
are pleasured very farre.

No ship could sail on Seas,
her course to run aright,
Nor Compass shew the ready way
were Magnes not of might.

Blush then, and blemish all,
bequeath to mee thats due,
Your seats in golde, your price in plate,
which Jewellers do renue.

Its I, its I alone,
whom you usurp upon,
Magnes my name, the Loadstone cal'd,
the prince of stones alone.

If this you can deny,
then seem to make reply,
And let the painfull sea-man judge,
the which of us doth lie.

The Mariner's Judgement.

The Loadstone is the stone,
the onely stone alone,
Deserving praise above the rest
whose vertues are unknown.

The Marchant's Verdict.

The Diamonds bright, the Saphires brave,
Are stones that bear the name,
but flatter not, and tell the troath,
Magnes deserves the same.
(Edition of 1720.)


Norman's Newe Attractive was well known to Gilbert,
as were also the Epistola of Peregrinus, the Magiae
Naturalis of Porta, and indeed all books treating of the
lodestone, the magnet, or the compass-needle. His
own work De Magnete, published in the year 1600, is a
compendium of the world's knowledge of magnetism
and electricity at the time. In its pages, he not only
discusses the opinions of others, but describes discoveries
of his own made during the twenty years which
he ardently devoted to the pursuit of experimental
science, crowning his investigations with theories in
electricity and magnetism as became a true philosopher.

Impressed by the originality of Gilbert's treatise, the
practical ingenuity and philosophic acumen displayed
throughout, Hallam wrote in his Introduction to the
Literature of Europe: "Gilbert not only collected all
the knowledge which others had possessed on the subject,
but became at once the father of experimental
philosophy in this island; and, by a singular felicity and
acuteness of genius, the founder of theories which have
been received after the lapse of ages and are almost
universally received into the creed of science."

At a period when natural science was taught in the
schools of Europe mainly from text-books, we find
Gilbert proclaiming by example and advocacy the paramount
value of experiment for the advancement of
learning. He was unsparing in his denunciation of the
superficiality and verbosity of mere bookmen, and had
no patience with writers who treated their subjects
"esoterically, reconditely and mystically." For him,
the laboratory method was the only one that could
secure fruitful results and contribute effectively to
the advancement of learning.

It is true that men of unusual ability and strong
character strove before his time to adjust the claims of
authority in matters scientific. While respectful of the
teachings of recognized leaders, they were not, however,
awed into acquiescence by an academical "magister
dixit." On the contrary, they wanted to test with their
eyes in order to judge with reason; believing in the
importance of experiment, they sought to acquire a
knowledge of nature from nature herself.

Such were Albert the Great and Friar Bacon. Albert
did not bow obsequiously to the authority of Aristotle
or any of his Arabian commentators; he investigated
for himself and became, for his age, a distinguished
botanist, physiologist and mineralogist.

The Franciscan monk of Ilchester has left us in his
Opus Majus a lasting memorial of his practical genius.
In the section entitled "Scientia Experimentalis," he
affirms that "Without experiment, nothing can be
adequately known. An argument proves theoretically,
but does not give the certitude necessary to remove all
doubt, nor will the mind repose in the clear view of
truth, unless it find it by way of experiment." And in
his Opus Tertium: "The strongest arguments prove
nothing, so long as the conclusions are not verified by
experience. Experimental science is the queen of sciences
and the goal of all speculation."

No one, even in our own times, wrote more strongly
in favor of the practical method than did this follower
of St. Francis in the thirteenth century. Being convinced
that there can be no conflict between scientific
and revealed truths, he became an irrepressible advocate
for observation and experiment in the study of the
phenomena and forces of nature.

The example of Peregrinus, of Albert and Friar
Bacon, not to mention others like Vincent of Beauvais,
the Dominican encyclopedist, was, however, not sufficient
to wean students from the easy-going routine of
book-learning. A few centuries had to elapse before
the weaning was effectively begun; and the man who
contributed in a marked degree to this result was Gilbert
the Philosopher of Colchester (1544-1603).

Having received the elements of his education in the
Grammar School of Colchester, his native town, Gilbert
entered St. John's College, Cambridge, from which
university he took his B. A. degree in 1560, M. A. in
1564 and M. D. in 1569. In all, he appears to have
been connected with the University for a period of
eleven or twelve years, as student, Fellow, and examiner.

On leaving Cambridge, Gilbert traveled for four years
on the Continent, principally in Italy, visiting medical
schools and studying methods of treatment under the
leading physicians and surgeons of the day as well as
discussing scientific theory with the leaders of thought.
On his return to England in 1573, he practised medicine
in London "with great applause and success."
He was elected President of the Royal College of Physicians
in 1599, and appointed Physician to Queen Elizabeth
in 1601 and to her successor, James I., in 1603.

On one occasion, he hears that Baptista Porta, whom
he calls "a philosopher of no ordinary note," said that
a piece of iron rubbed with a diamond turns to the
north. He suspects this to be heresy. So, forthwith
he proceeds to test the statement by experiment. He
was not dazzled by the reputation of Baptista Porta; he
respected Porta, but respected truth even more. He
tells us that he experimented with seventy diamonds in
presence of many witnesses, employing a number of
iron bars and pieces of wire, manipulating them with
the greatest care while they floated on corks; and concludes
his long and exhaustive research by plaintively
saying: "Yet never was it granted me to see the effect
mentioned by Porta."

Though it led to a negative result, this probing inquiry
was a masterpiece of experimental work.

Gilbert incidentally regrets that the men of his time
"are deplorably ignorant with respect to natural
things," and the only way he sees to remedy this is to
make them "quit the sort of learning that comes only
from books and that rests only on vain arguments and
conjectures," for he shrewdly remarks that "even men
of acute intelligence without actual knowledge of facts
and in the absence of experiment easily fall into error."

Acting on this intimate conviction, he labored for
twenty years over the theories and experiments which
he sets forth in his great work on the magnet. "There
is naught in these books," he tells us, "that has not
been investigated, and again and again done and repeated
under our eyes." He begs any one that should
feel disposed to challenge his results to repeat the
experiments for himself "carefully, skilfully and deftly,
but not heedlessly and bunglingly."

It has been said that we are indebted to Sir Francis
Bacon, Queen Elizabeth's Chancellor, for the inductive
method of studying the phenomena of nature. Bacon's
merit lies in the fact that he not only minutely analyzed
the method, pointing out its uses and abuses, but also
that he showed it to be the only one by which we can
attain an accurate knowledge of the physical world
around us. His sententious eulogy went forth to the
world of scholars invested with all the importance,
authority and dignity which the high position and
worldwide fame of the philosophic Chancellor could give
it. But while Bacon thought and wrote in his study,
Gilbert labored and toiled in his workshop. By his pen,
Bacon made a profound impression on the philosophic
mind of his age; by his researches, Gilbert explored
two provinces of nature and added them to the domain
of science. Bacon was a theorist, Gilbert an investigator.
For twenty years he shunned the glare of
society and the throbbing excitement of public life; he
wrenched himself away from all but the strictest exigencies
of his profession, in order to devote himself
undistractedly to the pursuit of science. And all this
forty years before the appearance of Bacon's Novum
Organum, the very work which contains the philosopher's
"large thoughts and lofty phrases" on the value
of experiment as a means for the advancement of
learning. During that long period Gilbert haunted Colchester,
where he delved into the secrets of nature and
prepared the materials for his great work on the magnet.
The publication of this Latin treatise made him
known in the universities at home and especially abroad:
he was appreciated by all the great physicists and
mathematicians of his age; by such men as Sir Kenelm
Digby; by William Barlowe, a great "magneticall"
man; by Kepler, the astronomer, who adopted and defended
his views; by Galileo himself, who said: "I
extremely admire and envy the author of De Magnete."

The science of magnetism owes more to Gilbert than
to any other man, Peregrinus (1269) excepted. He
repeated for himself the numerous and ingenious experiments
of the medieval philosopher, and added much
of his own which he discovered during the long period
of a life devoted to the diligent exploration of this
domain in the world of natural knowledge.

The ancients spoke of the lodestone as the Magnesian
stone, from its being found in abundance in the vicinity
of Magnesia, a city of Asia Minor. In his Latin treatise
of 254 (small) folio pages, Gilbert uses the adjective
form of the term, but never the noun "Magnetismus"
itself. Our English term magnetism appears for the
first time on page 2 of Archdeacon Barlowe's "Magneticall
Advertisements," published in 1616; while the
surprising compound, "electro-magnetismos," is the
title of a chapter in Father Kircher's "Magnes, sive de
Arte Magnetica," printed in the year 1641.

Gilbert showed that a great number of bodies could
be electrified; but maintained that those only could exhibit
magnetic properties which contain iron. He satisfies
himself of this by rubbing with a lodestone such
substances as wood, gold, silver, copper, zinc, lead,
glass, etc., and then floating them on corks, quaintly
adding that they show "no poles, because the energy
of the lodestone has no entrance into their interior."

To-day we know that nickel and cobalt behave like
iron, whilst antimony, bismuth, copper, silver and gold
are susceptible of being influenced by powerful electro-magnets,
showing what has been termed diamagnetic
phenomena. Even liquids and gases, in Faraday's
classical experiments, yielded to the influence of his great
magnet; and Professor Dewar, in the same Royal
Institution, exposed some of his liquid air and liquid
oxygen to the influence of Faraday's electromagnet and
found them to be strongly attracted, thus behaving like
the paramagnetic bodies, iron, nickel and cobalt.

Gilbert observes in all his magnets two points, one
near each end, in which the force, or, as he terms it,
"the supreme attractional power," is concentrated.
Like Peregrinus, he calls these points the poles of the
magnet, and the line joining them its magnetic axis.
With the aid of his steel versorium, he recognizes that
similar poles are mutually hostile, whilst opposite poles
seize and hold each other in friendly embrace. He also
satisfies himself that the energy of magnets resides not
only in their extremities, but that it permeates "their
inmost parts, being entire in the whole and entire in
each part." This is exactly what Peregrinus said in
1269 and what we say to-day; it is nothing else than
the molecular theory proposed by Weber, extended
by Ewing and universally accepted.

At any rate, Gilbert is quite certain that whatever
magnetism may be, it is not, like electricity, a material,
ponderable substance. He ascertained this by weighing
in the most accurate scales of a goldsmith a rod of
iron before and after it had been rubbed with the lodestone,
and then observing that the weight is precisely
the same in both cases, being "neither less nor more."

Without referring to the prior discovery of Norman,
whom he calls "a skilled navigator and ingenious artificer,"
Gilbert satisfies himself that not only the magnet,
but all the space surrounding it, possesses magnetic
properties; for the magnet "sends its force abroad
in all directions, according to its energy and quality."
This region of influence Norman called a sphere of
"vertue," and Gilbert an "orbis virtutis," which is the
Latin equivalent; we call it a "magnetic field," or field
of force, which is less expressive and less appropriate.
With wonderful intuition, Gilbert sees this space filled
with lines of magnetic virtue passing out radially from
his spherical lodestone, which lines he calls "rays of
magnetic force."

Clerk Maxwell was so fascinated with this beautiful
concept that he made it the work of his life to study
the field of force due to electrified bodies, to magnets
and to conductors conveying currents; his powerful intellect
visualized those lines and gave them accurate
mathematical expression in the great treatise on electricity
and magnetism which he gave to the world in
1873.

Gilbert observes that the lodestone may be spherical
or oblong; "whatever the shape, imperfect or irregular,
verticity is present; there are poles," and the lodestones
"have the selfsame way of turning to the poles of the
world." He knows that a compass-needle is not drawn
bodily towards the pole, and does not hesitate in this
instance to give credit to his countryman, Robert Norman,
for having clearly stated this fact and aptly demonstrated
it. Following Norman, he floats a needle
in a vessel by means of a piece of cork, and notices that
on whatever part of the surface of the water it may
be placed, the needle settles down after a few swings
invariably in the same direction. His words are: "It
revolves on its iron center and is not borne towards
the rim of the vessel."

Gilbert knew nothing about the mechanical couple
that came into play, but he knew the fact; and, with
the instinct of the philosopher, tested it in a variety of
ways.

We explain the orientation of the compass-needle by
saying that it is acted upon by a pair of equal and opposite
forces due to the influence of the terrestrial magnetic
poles on each end of the needle and by showing
that such a couple can produce rotation, but not translation.

We find Gilbert working not only with steel needles
and iron bars, but also with rings of iron. He strokes
them with a natural magnet and feels certain that he
has magnetized them. He assures us that "one of the
poles will be at the point rubbed and the other will be
at the opposite side." To show that the ring is really
magnetized, he cuts it across, opens it out, and finds
that the ends exhibit polar properties.

A favorite piece of apparatus with Gilbert, as with
Peregrinus, was a lodestone ground down into globular
form. He called it a terrella, a miniature earth, and
used it extensively for reproducing the phenomena described
by magnetizers, travelers
and navigators. He
breaks up terrellas, in order
to examine the magnetic
condition of their inner parts.
There is not a doubtful utterance
in his description of
what he finds; he speaks
clearly and emphatically.
"If magnetic bodies be
divided, or in any way broken
up, each several part hath a
north and a south end"; i.e.,
each part will be a complete
magnet.





Fig. 8
Begavior of Compas-Needle on a Terrella or Sphrical Lodestone


We find him also comparing magnets by what is
known to us as the "magnetometer method." He
brings the magnetized bars in turn near a compass-needle
and concludes that the magnet or the lodestone
which is able to make the needle go round is the best
and strongest. He also seeks to compare magnets by a
process of weighing, similar to what is called, in laboratory
parlance, the "test-nail" method. He also inquires
into the effect of heat upon his magnets, and
finds that 'a lodestone subjected to any great heat loses
some of its energy.' He applies a red-hot iron to a
compass-needle and notices that it 'stands still, not
turning to the iron.' He thrusts a magnetized bar into
the fire until it is red-hot and shows that it has lost all
magnetic power. He does not stop at this remarkable
discovery, for he proceeds to let his red-hot bars cool
while lying in various positions, and finds: (1) that the
bar will acquire magnetic properties if it lie in the
magnetic meridian; and (2) that it will acquire none if
it lie east and west. These effects he rightly attributes
to the inductive action of the earth.

Gilbert marks these and other experiments with
marginal asterisks; small stars denoting minor and large
ones important discoveries of his. There are in all 21
large and 178 small asterisks, as well as 84 illustrations
in De Magnete. This implies a vast amount of original
work, and forms no small contribution to the foundations
of electric and magnetic science.

Gilbert clearly realized the phenomena and laws of
magnetic induction. He tells us that "as soon as a bar
of iron comes within the lodestone's sphere of influence,
though it be at some distance from the lodestone itself,
the iron changes instantly and has its form renewed; it
was before dormant and inert; but now is quick and
active." He hangs a nail from a lodestone; a second
nail from the first, a third from the second and so on       a
well-known experiment, made every day for elementary
classes. Nor is this all, for he interposes between
the lodestone and his iron nail, thick boards, walls of
pottery and marble, and even metals, and he finds that
there is naught so solid as to do away with its force or
to check it, save a plate of iron. All that can be added
to this pregnant observation is that the plate of iron
must be very thick in order to carry all the lines of
force due to the magnet, and thus completely screen
the space beyond.

But Gilbert is astonishing when he goes on to make
thick boxes of gold, glass and marble; and, suspending
his needle within them, declares with excusable enthusiasm
that, regardless of the box which imprisons the
magnet, it turns to its predestined points of north and
south. He even constructs a box of iron, places his
magnet within, observes its behavior, and concludes
that it turns north and south, and would do so were
"it shut up in iron vaults sufficiently roomy." In this,
he was in error, for experiments show that if the sides
of the box are thin, the needle will experience the
directive force of the earth; but if they are sufficiently
thick       thick as the walls of an ordinary safe       the inside
of such a box will be completely screened; none of
the earth's magnetic lines will get into it so that the
needle will remain indifferently in any position in which
it is placed. Some years ago, the physical laboratory
of St. John's College, Oxford, was screened from the
obtrusive lines of neighboring dynamos by building two
brick walls parallel to each other and eight inches apart
and filling in the space with scrap iron. A delicate
magnetometer showed that such a structure allowed no
leakage of lines of force through it, but offered an impenetrable
barrier to the magnetic influence of the working
dynamos.

Gilbert's greatest discovery is that the earth itself
acts as a vast globular magnet having its magnetic
poles, axis and equator. The pole which is in our hemisphere,
he variously calls north, boreal or arctic. Whilst
that in the other hemisphere he calls south, austral or
antarctic. He sought to explain the magnetic condition
of our globe by the presence, especially in its innermost
parts, of what he calls true, terrene matter, homogeneous
in structure and endowed with magnetic properties,
so that every separate fragment exhibits the whole force
of magnetic matter. He is quite aware that his theory
is a grand generalization; and admits that it is "a new
and till now unheard-of view," and so confident is he in
its worth that he is not afraid to say that "it will stand
as firm as aught that ever was produced in philosophy,
backed by ingenious argumentation or buttressed by
mathematical demonstration."

In developing his theory of terrestrial magnetism,
Gilbert fell into certain errors, chiefly for want of data,
but partly also by reason of his adherence to the view
that the earth exactly resembled his terrella in its magnetic
action. Accordingly, he believed that the magnetic
poles of the earth were diametrically opposite each
other and that they coincided with the poles of rotation,
whence it followed that the magnetic meridian everywhere
coincided with the geographical, and that the
magnet, unless influenced by local disturbances, stood
true to the pole.

It was, however, well known from the thrilling experience
of Columbus and the constant report of travelers
that this was not the case. Gilbert himself says
that at the time of writing, in the year 1600, the needle
pointed 11-1/3° east of north in London; but what he did
not know and could not have known was that this easterly
deviation was decreasing from year to year, to vanish
altogether in 1657, after which the needle began to
decline to the west.

This magnetic declination sorely perplexed Gilbert, as
it did not fit in with his theory. Yet an explanation
was needed; and as the earth must be considered a normal
and well-behaved magnet, though of cosmical size,
Gilbert turns the difficulty by saying that this variation
is nothing else than "a sort of perturbation of the
directive force" caused by inequalities in the earth's
surface by continents and mountain masses: "Since the
earth's surface is diversified by elevations of land and
depths of seas, great continental lands, oceans and seas
differing in every way while the power that produces
all magnetic movements comes from the constant magnetic
earth-substance which is strongest in the most
massive continent and not where the surface is water
or fluid or unsettled, it follows that toward a massive
body of land or continent rising to some height in any
meridian, there is a measurable magnetic leaning from
the true pole toward the east or the west."

So convinced is Gilbert of the true and satisfactory
character of his explanation that he goes on to say that,
"In northern regions, the compass varies because of the
northern eminences; in southern regions, because of
southern eminences. On the equator, if the eminences
on both sides were equal, there would be no variation."
In a later chapter of Book IV., he adds that, "in the
heart of great continents there is no variation; so, too,
in the midst of great seas."

As continents and mountain-chains are among the
permanent features of our planet, Gilbert concluded
that the misdirection of the needle was likewise permanent
or constant at any given place, a conclusion
which observations made after Gilbert's time showed to
be incorrect. Gilbert writes: "As the needle hath ever
inclined toward the east or toward the west, so even
now does the arc of variation continue to be the same
in whatever place or region, be it sea or continent; so,
too, will it be forever unchanging."

This we know to be untrue, and Gilbert, too, could
have known as much had he brought the experimental
method, which he used with such consummate skill and
fruitful results in other departments of his favorite
studies, to bear on this particular element of terrestrial
magnetism. He labored with incredible ardor and persistence
for twenty years in his workshops at Colchester
over the experiments in electricity, magnetism and terrestrial
magnetism which he embodies and discusses in
his original and epoch-making book, De Magnete, published
in the year 1600; a period of twenty years was
long enough for such a careful observer as he was to detect
the slow change in magnetic declination discovered
by his friend Gellibrand in 1634, published by him in 1635,
and known to-day as the "secular variation." It is
true the quantity to be measured was small; but what
is surprising is that such an industrious and resourceful
experimenter as Gilbert was does not record in his pages
any observations of his own on declination or dip, elements
of primary importance in magnetic theory.

Shortly after the voyage of Columbus it was thought
that the longitude of a place could be found from its
magnetic declination. Gilbert, however, did not think
so, and accordingly scores those who championed that
view. "Porta," he says, "is deluded by a vain hope
and a baseless theory"; Livius Sanutus "sorely tortures
himself and his readers with like vanities"; and
even the researches of Stevin, the great Flemish mathematician,
on the cause of variation in the southern
regions of the earth are "utterly vain and absurd."

With regard to dip, Gilbert erroneously held that for
any given latitude it had a constant value. He was so
charmed with this constancy that he proposed it as a
means of determining latitude. There is no diffidence
in his mind about the matter; he is sure that with his
"inclinatorium" or dip-circle, together with accompanying
tables, calculated for him by Briggs, of logarithmic
fame, an observer can find his latitude "in any part of
the world without the aid of the sun, planets or fixed
stars in foggy weather as well as in darkness."

After such a statement, it is no wonder that he waxes
warm over the capabilities of his instrument and allows
himself to exclaim: "We can see how far from idle is
magnetic philosophy; on the contrary, how delightful it
is, how beneficial, how divine! Seamen tossed by the
waves and vexed with incessant storms while they cannot
learn even from the heavenly luminaries aught as
to where on earth they are, may with the greatest ease
gain comfort from an insignificant instrument and
ascertain the latitude of the place where they happen
to be."

Gilbert dwells at length on the inductive action of the
earth. He hammers heated bars of iron on his anvil
and then allows them to cool while lying in the
magnetic meridian. He notes that they become magnetized,
and does not fail to point out the polarity of
each end. He likewise attributes to the influence of
the earth the magnetic condition acquired by iron bars
that have for a long time lain fixed in the north-and-south
position and ingenuously adds: "for great is the
effect of long-continued direction of a body towards the
poles." To the same cause, he attributes the magnetization
of iron crosses attached to steeples, towers, etc.,
and does not hesitate to say that the foot of the cross
always acquires north-seeking polarity.

In a similar manner, every vertical piece of iron, like
railings, lamp-posts, and fire-irons, becomes a magnet
under the inductive action of the earth. In the case of
our modern ships, the magnetization of every plate and
vertical post, intensified by the hammering during construction,
converts the whole vessel into a magnetic
magazine, the resulting complex "field" rendering the
adjustment of the compasses somewhat difficult and
unreliable. The unreliable character of the adjustment
arises mainly from the changing magnetism of the ship
with change of place in the earth's magnetic field, the
effect increasing slightly from the magnetic equator to
the poles.

With luminous insight into the phenomena of terrestrial
magnetism, Gilbert observes that in the neighborhood
of the poles, a compass-needle, tending as it does
to dip greatly, must in consequence experience only a
feeble directive power. To which he adds that "at the
poles there is no direction," meaning, no doubt, that a
compass-needle would remain in any horizontal position
in which it might be placed when in the vicinity of the
magnetic pole.

This is precisely the experience of all Arctic explorers,
who find that their compasses become less and less active
as they sail northward, the reason being that the
horizontal component of the earth's magnetic force,
which alone controls the movements of the compass-needle,
decreases as the ship advances and vanishes
altogether at the magnetic pole. When once a high
latitude is reached, captains do not depend upon their
compasses for their bearings, but have recourse to astronomical
observations. In his account of magnetic
work carried on in the neighborhood of the magnetic
pole, Amundsen says: "At Prescott Island the compass,
which for some time had been somewhat sluggish,
refused entirely to act, and we could as well have used
a stick to steer by."

As a physician, Gilbert valued iron for its medicinal
properties, but denounced quacks and wandering
mountebanks who practised "the vilest imposture for
lucre's sake," using powdered lodestone for the cure of
wounds and disorders. "Headaches," he said, "are
no more cured by application of a lodestone than by
putting on an iron helmet or a steel hat"; and again:
"To give it in a draught to dropsical persons is either
an error of the ancients or an impudent tale of their
copyists." Elsewhere he condemns prescriptions of
lodestone as "an evil and deadly advice" and as "an
abominable imposture."

In the sixth and last book of De Magnete, Gilbert sets
forth his views on such astronomical subjects as the
figure of the earth, its suspension in space, rotation on
its axis and revolution around the sun.

As to the figure of our planet, the primitive view
widely credited in early times was that the earth is a
flat, uneven mass floating in a boundless ocean. The
Hindoos, however, did not accept the flatland doctrine,
but taught that the earth was a convex mass which
rested on the back of a triad of elephants having for
their support the carapace of a gigantic tortoise. Of
course, they did not say how the complaisant chelonian
contrived to maintain his wonderful state of equilibrium
under the superincumbent mass.

Aristotle (384-322, B. C.) taught that the earth, fixed
in the center of the universe, is not flat as a disk, but
round as an orange, giving as proofs (1) the gradual
disappearance of a ship standing out to sea and (2)
the form of the shadow cast by the earth in lunar
eclipses, to which others added (3) the change in the
altitude of circumpolar stars readily noticeable in traveling
north or south. Aristarchus of Samos (310-250),
one of the great astronomers of antiquity, went further,
not fearing to teach that the earth is spherical in form,
that it turns on its axis daily and revolves annually
around the sun. Such orthodox teaching did not, however,
commend itself to people generally, as they did
not exactly like the idea of being whisked round with
their houses and cities at a dangerous speed, preferring
to explain celestial phenomena by the rotation of the
vast celestial sphere, with all the starry host, round a
flat, immovable earth. For them such a system of cosmography
recommended itself by its simplicity and
reasonableness as well as by the sense of stability, rest
and comfort which it brought along with it.

Ptolemy, who flourished at Alexandria about 150 A.
D. and whose name is associated with a system of the
world, also held that the earth is spherical in form, giving
at the same time some very ingenious proofs of his
belief. St. Augustine, in the fourth century, was not
opposed to the doctrine of a round earth, though he felt
the religious difficulty arising from the existence of
the antipodes, which difficulty reached its acute stage
four hundred years later.

It is well to remember that the Church did not condemn
the existence of an antipodean world; what it did condemn
was the teaching of Virgilius, Bishop of Salzburg,
to the effect that this world, lying under the equator, was
inhabited by a race of men not descended from Adam.
Virgilius also taught that the antipodes had a sun and
moon different from ours, an astronomical opinion for
which he was never molested by ecclesiastical authority.

Boethius, the worthy representative of the natural
and the higher philosophy of the sixth century, wrote
of the earth as globe-like in form, but small in comparison
with the heavens. Isidore of Seville, in the seventh
century, "the most learned man of his age," and
the encyclopedic Bede, in the eighth, rejected the theory
of a flat, discoidal earth and returned to the spherical
form of the early Greek astronomers. But again,
centuries had to elapse before people could be brought
to tolerate views of the world that seemed so directly
opposed to the daily testimony of their senses.

The strong, conclusive arguments which alone establish
this theory on a firm basis were, however, not
known to Copernicus and could not have been known in
an age that preceded the invention of the telescope and
in which the astronomer had to be the constructor of
his own crude wooden instruments. The wonder is that
Copernicus did such excellent observational work on the
banks of the Vistula with the rough appliances at his
disposal. The arguments which he put forward and
urged with consummate skill for the acceptance of his
revolutionary theory were its general simplicity and
probability. Of proofs clear and decisive, he gave
none; yet, while he was working on his epoch-making
treatise, begun in 1507 and published in 1543 with dedication
to Pope Paul III., a direct proof of the earth's
spherical form was given by the return (1528) from the
Philippines along an eastern route of one of Magellan's
ships, which had reached those distant isles after crossing
the western ocean, which the Portuguese navigator
called the "Pacific," from the tranquility of its waters.
For a direct proof of the earth's annual motion, the
world had to wait two hundred years more, until Bradley
discovered the "aberration of light" in 1729; and for a
direct demonstration of its diurnal motion until Foucault
made his pendulum experiment in the Panthéon, in
1851.

We cannot let Gilbert's reference to a "weightless
earth" pass without a few remarks to justify our
approval of the statement.

The idea connoted by the term weight is the pull
which the earth exerts on the mass of a body; thus,
when we say that an iron ball weighs six pounds, we
mean that the earth pulls it downwards with a force
equal to the weight of six pounds. That the weight of
a given lump of matter is not a constant but a dependent
quantity may be seen from a number of considerations.
Its weight in vacuo, for instance, is different
from its weight in air, and this latter differs considerably
from its weight in water or in oil. Again, if we take
our experimental ball down the shaft of a mine, the
spring-balance used to measure the pull of the earth on
it will not record six pounds but something less; and
the further we descend, the less will the spring-balance
be found to register. At a depth of two thousand miles
below the surface, the ball would be found to have lost
half its weight; and at a depth of four thousand, all its
weight. At the earth's center a "box of weights"
would still be called a "box of weights," though neither
the box itself nor its enclosed standards singly or collectively
would have any weight whatever. It has been
shown experimentally that two masses weigh slightly
less when placed one above the other than when placed
side by side, because in the latter case their common
mass-center is measurably nearer to the center of the
earth. Every mother knows that when a boy is sent
to buy a pound of candy, it is the mass of the sweet
stuff that makes him happy, and not its weight, for this
acts more like an incumbrance while he is bringing it
home. Of course, weight is every day used, and correctly,
as a measure of mass, for every student of
mechanics writes without the least hesitation,


W=Mg.


by which he simply means that the weight of a body is
directly proportional to its mass (M), which is constant
wherever the body may be taken, and to the intensity
of gravity (g), which varies slightly with geographical
position. As both scale-pans of an ordinary balance
are equally affected by the local value of g, it follows
that equilibrium is established only when the two masses       that
of the body and that of the standards       are themselves
equal: hence weighing is in reality only a process
of comparing masses, i.e., a process of "massing."

If we bring our experimental ball to the top of a hill
or to the summit of a mountain or aloft in a balloon, we
find the pull on the registering spring growing less and
less as we go higher and higher, from which we naturally
conclude that if we could go far enough out into
circumterrestrial space, say, towards the moon, the
ball would lose its weight entirely; it would cease to
stretch the spring of the measuring balance, its weight
vanishing at a definite, calculable distance from the
earth's center. If carried beyond that point the ball
would come under the moon's preponderating attraction
and would begin to depress anew the index of the balance
until at the surface of our satellite it would be
found to weigh exactly one pound. If transferred to
the planet Mars the ball would weigh two pounds, and
if to the surface of the giant planet Jupiter, sixteen
pounds. But while its weight thus changes continually,
its mass or quantity of matter, the stuff of which it is
made, remains constant all the while, being equally unaffected
by such variables as motion, position or even
temperature.

Returning from celestial space to our more congenial
terrestrial surroundings, we find a similar inconstancy
in the weight of the ball as we travel from the equator
toward either pole, the weight being least at the equator
and slightly greater at either end of our axis of
rotation. This change is fully accounted for by the
spheroidal figure of the earth and its motion of rotation,
in virtue of which, while going from the equator
toward the pole, our distance from the center of
attraction undergoes a slight diminution, as does also
the component of the local centrifugal force, which is in
opposition to gravity.

From all this, it will be seen that the weight of a
body is more of the nature of an accidental rather than
an essential property of matter, whereas its mass is a
necessary and unvarying property. Hence we speak
with propriety of the conservation of mass just as we
speak with equal propriety of the conservation of energy;
but we may never speak or write of the conservation
of weight. The mass of our iron ball is precisely
the same away from the surface of the earth as it is
anywhere on the surface, whether a thousand miles
below the surface or a thousand miles above it; and the
same it would be found in any part of the solar system
or of the starry universe to which it might be taken.

Since weight is nothing else than the pull which the
earth exerts on a body, it follows that, big and massive
as our planet is, it must, nevertheless, be weightless;
for it cannot with any degree of propriety be said to
pull itself. It is incapable of producing even an infinitesimal
change in the position of its mass-center, or
center of gravity, as this centroid is sometimes called.
The earth attracts itself with no force whatever; but is
attracted and governed in its annual movement by the
sun, the central controlling body of our system, while
the moon and planets play only the part of petty
disturbers.

It would, however, be right to speak of the weight of
the earth relatively to the sun; for the sun attracts the
mass of our planet with a certain definite force, readily
calculable from the familiar formula for central force,
viz., mv2/r., in which m is the mass of the earth, v its
orbital velocity and r its distance from the sun. Supplying
the numbers, the weight of the earth relatively
to the sun, comes out to be


3,000000,000000,000000 or 3×10^{18} tons weight,


or, in words, three million million million tons weight.

It may here be noted that the velocity v of the earth
in its orbit is a varying quantity, depending on distance
from the sun. As this distance is least in December
and greatest in June, it follows that the earth is heavier
relatively to the sun in winter than it is in summer.

The mass of the earth, on the other hand, is not a
relative and variable quantity, but a constant and independent
one, which would not be affected either by the
sudden annihilation of all the other members of the
solar system or by the instantaneous or successive addition
of a thousand orbs. Mass being the product of
volume by density, that of the earth is 6000,000000,000000,000000
or 6×1021 tons mass, which reads six
thousand million million million tons mass.

The number which expresses the mass of the earth
is thus very different from that which represents its
weight relatively to the sun. It is obvious that the latter
would be a much greater quantity if our planet were
transferred to the orbit of Venus and very much less if
transferred to that of far-off Jupiter, but the number
which expresses its mass would remain precisely the
same in both cases, viz., the value given above.

In elaborating his theory of magnetism, and especially
his magnetic theory of the earth, Gilbert made extensive
use of lodestone-globes, which he called "terrellas,"
i.e., miniature models of the earth. In pursuing his
searching inquiry, he was gradually led from these
"terrellas" to his great induction that the earth itself
is a colossal, globe-like magnet. Following Norman,
"the ingenious artificer," of Limehouse, London, he
also showed that the entire cubical space which surrounds
a lodestone is an "orb of virtue," or region of
influence, from which he inferred that the earth itself
must have its "orb of virtue," or magnetic field, extending
outward to a very great distance.

Gilbert does not, for a moment, think that this theory
of terrestrial magnetism, the first ever given to the
world, is a wild speculation. Far from it; he is convinced
that "it will stand as firm as aught that ever
was produced in philosophy, backed by ingenious argumentation
or buttressed by mathematical demonstration."

If the earth has a magnetic field, he argued, why not
the moon, the planets and the sun itself, "the mover
and inciter of the universe"? Given these planetary
magnetic fields, Gilbert seems to have no difficulty in
finding out the forces necessary to account for the crucial
difficulties of the Copernican doctrine. Nor is the
medium absent that is needed for the mutual action of
magnetic globes, for we are assured that it is none
other than the universal ether, which, he says "is
without resistance."

Gilbert disposes of the cosmographic puzzle of the
"suspension" of the earth in space by saying, and saying
justly, that the earth "has no heaviness of its own,"
and, therefore, "does not stray away into every region
of the sky." To emphasize the statement, he continues:
"The earth, in its own place, is in no wise heavy,
nor does it need any balancing"; and again, "The
whole earth itself has no weight." "By the wonderful
wisdom of the Creator," he elsewhere says, "forces
were implanted in the earth that the globe itself might
with steadfastness take direction."

Gilbert holds that the daily rotation of the earth on
its axis is also caused, and maintained with strict uniformity,
by the same prevalent system of magnetic
forces, for "lest the earth should in divers ways perish
and be destroyed, she rotates in virtue of her magnetic
energy, and such also are the movements of the rest
of the planets."

Just how this magnetic energy acts to produce the
rotatory motion of a massive globe Gilbert does not say.
Nor was he able to solve such a magnetic riddle, for there
was nothing in his philosophy to explain how a lodestone-globe
in free space should ever become a perpetual
magnetic motor. Oddly enough he disagrees with Peregrinus,
who maintained in his Epistola, 1269, that a
terrella, or spherical lodestone, poised in the meridian,
would turn on its axis regularly every 24 hours. He
naively says: "We have never chanced to see this;
nay, we doubt if there is such a movement." Continuing,
he brings out his clinching argument: "This daily
rotation seems to some philosophers wonderful and incredible
because of the ingrained belief that the mighty
mass of earth makes an orbital movement in 24 hours;
it were more incredible that the moon should in the
space of 24 hours traverse her orbit or complete her
course; more incredible that the sun and Mars should
do so; still more that Jupiter and Saturn; more than
wonderful would be the velocity of the fixed stars and
firmament."

Here he finds himself obliged to berate Ptolemy for
being "over-timid and scrupulous in apprehending a
break up of this nether world were the earth to move
in a circle. Why does he not apprehend universal ruin,
dissolution, confusion, conflagration and stupendous celestial
and super-celestial calamities from a motion (that
of the starry sphere) which surpasses all imagination,
all dreams and fables and poetic license, a motion ineffable
and inconceivable?"

Gilbert is not clear and emphatic on the other doctrine
of Copernicus, the revolution of the earth and planets
around the sun. He does, however, say that each of
the moving globes "has circular motion either in a
great circular orbit or on its own axis, or in both ways."
Again: "The earth by some great necessity, even by a
virtue innate, evident and conspicuous, is turned circularly
about the sun." Elsewhere he affirms that the moon
circles round the earth "by a magnetic compact of both."
He returns to this point in his De Mundo Nostro, saying,
"The force which emanates from the moon reaches to
the earth; and, in like manner, the magnetic virtue of
the earth pervades the region of the moon."

We have here an implied interaction between two
magnetic fields, rather a clever idea for a magnetician
of the sixteenth century. In one case, the reaction is
between the field of the earth and that of the moon,
compelling the latter to rotate round its primary once
every month; and the second, between the field of the
earth and that of the sun, compelling our planet to revolve
round the center of our system once every year.

Though an inefficient cause of the annual motion of
our planet, this interaction of two magnetic fields had,
nevertheless, something in common with the idea of the
mutual action of material particles postulated in the
Newtonian theory of universal gravitation.

This magnetic assumption by which Gilbert sought
to defend the theory of the universe propounded by
Copernicus was a very vulnerable point in his astronomical
armor which was promptly detected and fiercely
assailed by a galaxy of continental writers; all of them
churchmen, physicists and astronomers of note. They
accepted Gilbert's electric and magnetic discoveries and
warmed up to his experimental method; they did not
discard his theory of terrestrial magnetism, but rejected
and scoffed at the use which he made of it to justify
the heliocentric theory. They poked fun at the English
philosopher for his magnetic hypothesis of planetary
rotation and revolution, and succeeded in discrediting
the Copernican doctrine. Error prevailed for a time,
but Newton's Principia, published in 1687, gave the
Ptolemaic system the coup de grâce. Gilbert's hypothesis
of the interaction of planetary magnetic fields gave
way to universal gravitation, and Copernicanism was
finally triumphant.

Throughout the pages of Gilbert's treatise, he shows
himself remarkably chary in bestowing praise, but surprisingly
vigorous in denunciation. St. Thomas is an
instance of the former, for it is said that he gets at the
nature of the lodestone fairly well; and it is admitted
that "with his godlike and perspicacious mind, he
would have developed many a point had he been acquainted
with magnetic experiments." Taisnier, the
Belgian, is an example of the latter, whose plagiarism
from Peregrinus wrings from our indignant author
such withering words as "May the gods damn all
such sham, pilfered, distorted works, which so muddle
the minds of students!"

Besides his treatise on the magnet, Gilbert is the
author of an extensive work entitled, "De Mundo
Nostro Sublunari," in which he defends the modern
system of the universe propounded by Copernicus and
gives his views on important cosmical problems. This
work was published after the author's death, first at
Stettin in 1628, and again at Amsterdam in 1651.

Chancellor Bacon was well acquainted with this treatise
of our philosopher; indeed he had in his collection the
only two manuscript copies ever made, one in Latin and
the other in English, a very singular and significant
fact in view of the Chancellor's attitude toward Gilbert.
Putting it crudely, one would like to know how he obtained
possession of the manuscripts and what was his
motive in keeping them hidden away from the philosophers
of the day. "It is considered surprising," writes
Prof. Silvanus P. Thompson, "that Bacon, who had the
manuscripts in his possession and held them for years
unpublished, should have written severe strictures upon
their dead author and his methods, while at the very
same time posing as the discoverer of the inductive
method in science, a method which Gilberd (Gilbert)
had practised for years before."[6]

That Bacon was no admirer of Gilbert's physical and
cosmical theories the following passages will show. In
the "Novum Organum" the Chancellor wrote: "His
philosophy is an instance of extravagant speculation
founded on insufficient data"; again, "As the alchemists
made a philosophy out of a few experiments of the furnace,
Gilbert, our countryman, hath made a philosophy
out of the lodestone" ("The Advancement of Learning");
lastly, "Gilbert hath attempted a general system
on the magnet, endeavoring to build a ship out of
materials not sufficient to make the rowing-pins of a
boat" ("De Augmentis Scientiarum").

One is tempted to ask how this strange disregard
which Bacon entertained for the scientific views of the
greatest natural philosopher of his age and country
came to exist? Was it due to a feeling of jealousy that
could not brook a rival in the domain of the higher
philosophy, or was it because Bacon, the anti-Copernican,
wanted to write down Gilbert, the defender of
the heliocentric theory, in the British Isles?

When reading Bacon's depreciatory remarks we have
to remember that his mathematical and physical outfit
was very limited even for the age in which he lived;
from which it is safe to infer that he was but little
qualified to pass judgment on the value of the electric
and magnetic work accomplished in the workshops at
Colchester or on the theories to which they gave rise.

Bacon deserves praise for denouncing the prevalent
system of natural philosophy which was mainly authoritative,
speculative and syllogistic instead of experimental,
deductive and inductive, but he was inconsistent
and forgetful of his own principles when he belittled
the greatest living enemy of mere book-learning, and
the most earnest advocate, by word and example, of
the laboratory methods for the advancement of learning.

To avoid misapprehension, it should be here stated
that Bacon was not always censorious in his treatment
of his illustrious fellow-citizen, for in several places
he writes approvingly of the electric and magnetic
experiments contained in De Magnete, which he calls
in his Advancement of Learning, "a painfull (i.e.,
painstaking) experimentall booke." In other places he
draws so freely on Gilbert without acknowledgment as
to come dangerously near the suspicion of plagiarism.

Gilbert died, probably of the plague, in the sixtieth
year of his age, on December 10th, 1603, and was buried
in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church, Colchester,
where a mural tablet records in Latin the chief facts
of his life.

Dr. Fuller in his "Worthies of England" (1662) describes
Gilbert as tall of stature and cheerful of "complexion,"
a happiness, he quaintly remarks, not ordinarily
found in so hard a student and retired a person."
Concluding his appreciation of the philosopher, Fuller
writes: "Mahomet's tomb at Mecha[7] is said strangely
to hang up, attracted by some invisible loadstone; but
the memory of this Doctor will never fall to the ground,
which his incomparable book De Magnete will support
to eternity."

Animated by a similar spirit of national pride, Dryden
wrote


Gilbert shall live till loadstones cease to draw,
Or British fleets the boundless ocean awe.


We shall close these remarks by Hallam's estimate of
Gilbert as a scientific pioneer, contained in his Introduction
to the Literature of Europe. "The year 1600,"
he says, "was the first in which England produced a
remarkable work in physical science; but this was one
sufficient to raise a lasting reputation for its author.
Gilbert, a physician, in his Latin treatise on the magnet,
not only collected all the knowledge which others had
possessed on the subject, but became at once the father
of experimental philosophy in this island; and, by a
singular felicity and acuteness of genius, the founder
of theories which have been revived after a lapse of
ages and are almost universally received into the creed
of science."

For well-nigh three hundred years, De Magnete remained
untranslated, being read only by the scholarly
few. The first translation was made by P. Fleury Mottelay,
of New York, and published by Messrs. Wiley
and Sons in the year 1893. Mr. Mottelay has given
much attention to the bibliography of the twin sciences
of electricity and magnetism, as the foot-notes which
he has added to the translation abundantly prove.

A second translation appeared in the tercentenary year,
1900, and was the work of the members of the Gilbert
Club, London, among whom were Dr. Joseph Larmor
and Prof. Silvanus P. Thompson. It is a page-for-page
translation with facsimile illustrations, initial letters
and tail-pieces.

As one would infer from the numerous references
contained in De Magnete, Gilbert had a considerable
collection of valuable books, classical and modern, bearing
on the subject of his life-work; but these, as well
as his terrellas, globes, minerals and instruments, perished
in the great fire of London, 1666, with the buildings
of the College of Physicians, in which they were
located.

A portrait of Gilbert was preserved in the Bodleian
Library, Oxford, for many years; but has long since
disappeared from its walls. On the occasion of the
three hundredth anniversary (1903) of Gilbert's death,
a fine painting representing the Doctor in the act of
showing some of his electrical experiments to Queen
Elizabeth and her court (including Sir Walter Raleigh,
Sir Francis Drake and Cecil, Lord Burleigh, famous Secretary
of State), was presented to the Mayor of Colchester
by the London Institute of Electrical Engineers.
A replica of the painting was sent to the St. Louis Exposition,
1904, where it formed one of the attractions of
the Electricity Building.

The house in which Gilbert was born (1544) still stands
in Holy Trinity Street, Colchester, where it is frequently
visited by persons interested in the history of electric
and magnetic science.

CHAPTER III.
Franklin and Some Contemporaries.


As already seen, the writers of Greece and Rome knew
little about the lodestone; we have now to add that the
knowledge of electricity which they possessed was of the
same elementary character. They knew that certain
resinous substances, such as amber and jet had, when
rubbed, the property of attracting straws, feathers, dry
leaves and other light bodies; beyond this, their philosophy
did not go. The Middle Ages added little to the
subject, as the Schoolmen were occupied with questions
of a higher order. The Saxon Heptarchy came and
went, Alcuin taught in the schools of Charlemagne,
Cardinal Langton compelled a landless and worthless
king to sign Magna Charta, universities were founded
with Papal sanction in Italy, France, Germany, England
and Scotland, Copernicus wrote his treatise on the
revolution of heavenly bodies and dedicated it to Pope
Paul III., Tycho Brahé made his famous astronomical
observations at Uranienborg and befriended at Prague
the penniless Kepler, and Columbus gave a New World
to Castile and Leon       all this before the man appeared
who, using amber as guide, discovered a new world of
phenomena, of thought and philosophy. This man
was no other that Gilbert, whose discoveries in magnetism
were described in an earlier chapter. The
trunk line of his work was magnetism; electricity was
only a siding. One was the main subject of a life-long
quest while the other was only a digression. It was a
digression in which the qualities of the native-born
investigator are seen at their very best: alertness and
earnestness, resourcefulness and perseverance, all rewarded
by a rich harvest of valuable results. It is
refreshing and inspiring to read the Second Book of
Gilbert's treatise, De Magnete, in which are recorded in
quick succession the twenty important discoveries which
he made in his new field of labor.

At the very outset, he found it necessary to invent a
recording instrument to
test the electrification
produced by rubbing a
great variety of substances.
This he appropriately
called a versorium;
we would call it
an electroscope. "Make to yourself," he says, "a rotating
needle of any sort of metal three or four fingers
long and pretty light and poised on a sharp point."
He then briskly rubs and brings near his versorium glass,
sulphur, opal, diamond, sapphire, carbuncle, rock-crystal,
sealing-wax, alum, resin, etc., and finds that all these
attract his suspended needle, and not only the needle,
but everything else. His words are remarkable: "All
things are drawn to electrics." Here is a great advance
on the amber and jet, the only two bodies previously
known as having the power to attract "straws, chaff
and twigs," the usual test-substances of the ancients.
Pursuing his investigations, he finds numerous bodies
which perplex him, because when rubbed they do not
affect his electroscope. Among these, he enumerates:
bone, ivory, marble, flint, silver, copper, gold, iron,
even the lodestone itself. The former class he called
electrica, electrics; the latter was termed anelectrica,
non-electrics.

To Gilbert we, therefore, are indebted for the terms
electric and electrical, which he took from the Greek
name for amber instead of succinic and succinical, their
Latin equivalents. The noun electricity was a coinage of
a later period, due probably to Sir Thomas Browne, in
whose Pseudodoxia Epidemica, 1646, it occurs in the
singular number on page 51 and in the plural on page
79. It may interest the reader to be here retold that
we owe the chemical term affinity to Albertus Magnus,
barometer to Boyle, gas to van Helmont, magnetism to
Barlowe, magnetic inclination to Bond, electric circuit
to Watson, electric potential to Green, galvanometer to
Cumming, electro-magnetism to Kircher, electromagnet
to Sturgeon, and telephone to Wheatstone.

Gilbert was perplexed by the anomalous behavior of
his non-electrics. He toiled and labored hard to find out
the cause. He undertook a long, abstract, philosophical
discussion on the nature of bodies which, from its very
subtlety, failed to reveal the cause of his perplexing
anomaly. Gilbert failed to discover the distinction
between conductors and insulators; and, as a consequence,
never found out that similarly electrified bodies
repel each other. Had he but suspended an excited
stick of sealing-wax, what a promised land of electrical
wonders would have unfolded itself to his vision and
what a harvest of results such a reaper would have
gathered in! From solids, Gilbert proceeds to examine
the behavior of liquids, and finds that they, too, are
susceptible of electrical influence. He notices that a
piece of rubbed amber when brought near a drop of
water deforms it, drawing it out into a conical shape.
He even experiments with smoke, concluding that the
small carbon particles are attracted by an electrified
body. Some years ago, Sir Oliver Lodge, extending this
observation, proposed to lay the poisonous dust floating
about in the atmosphere of lead works by means of
large electrostatic machines. He even hinted in his
Royal Institution lecture that they might be useful in
dissipating mists and fogs, and recommended that a
trial be made on some of our ocean-steamers.

Gilbert next tries heat as an agent to produce electrification.
He takes a red-hot coal and finds that it has
no effect on his electroscope; he heats a mass of iron
up to whiteness and finds that it, too, exerts no electrical
effect. He tries a flame, a candle, a burning torch, and
concludes that all bodies are attracted by electrics save
those that are afire or flaming, or extremely rarefied.
He then reverses the experiment, bringing near an excited
body the flame of a lamp, and ingenuously states
that the body no longer attracts the pivoted needle.
He thus discovered the neutralizing effect of flames,
and supplied us with the readiest means that we have
to-day for discharging non-conductors.

He goes a step further; for we find him exposing
some of his electrics to the action of the sun's rays in
order to see whether they acquired a charge; but all his
results were negative. He then concentrates the rays
of the sun by means of lenses, evidently expecting
some electrical effect; but finding none, concludes with
a vein of pathos that the sun imparts no power, but
dissipates and spoils the electric effluvium.

Professor Righi has shown that a clean metallic plate
acquires a positive charge when exposed to the ultraviolet
radiation from any artificial source of light, but
that it does not when exposed to solar rays. The
absence of electrical effects in the latter case is attributed
to the absorptive action of the atmosphere on the
shorter waves of the solar beam.

Of course Gilbert permits himself some speculation as
to the nature of the agent with which he was dealing.
He thought of it, reasoned about it, pursued it in every
way; and came to the conclusion that it must be something
extremely tenuous indeed, but yet substantial,
ponderable, material. "As air is the effluvium of the
earth," he says, "so electrified bodies have an effluvium
of their own, which they emit when stimulated
or excited"; and again: "It is probable that amber
exhales something peculiar that attracts the bodies
themselves."

These views are quite in line with the electronic theory
of electricity in vogue to-day, which invests that
elusive entity with an atomic structure. It is held that
the tiny particles or electrons that are shot out from
the cathode terminal of a vacuum tube with astounding
velocity are none other than particles of negative electricity,
pure and simple. They have mass and inertia,
both of which properties are held to be entirely electrical,
though quite analogous to the mass and inertia
of ordinary, ponderable matter.

History shows that scientific theories have their periods
of infancy, maturity and decay. When they have
served their purpose, like the scaffolding of a building,
they are removed from sight and stored away, say, in a
limbo of discarded philosophy, for use of the historian
of science or of the metaphysician writing on the nature
of human knowledge. Such was the fate of Gilbert's
"effluvium" theory of electricity, of the fluid theories
of Dufay and Franklin, and the ether-strain theory
of recent years. "Each physical hypothesis," says
Prof. Fleming, "serves as a lamp to conduct us a certain
stage in the journey. It illumines a limited portion
of the path, throwing light before and behind for
some distance; but it has to be discarded and exchanged
at intervals because it has become exhausted and because
its work is done."

It is a little surprising that the phenomenon of electrical
repulsion should have escaped the attention of one
so skilled in experimentation as Gilbert. Yet such
was the case; and Gilbert even went so far as to deny its
very existence, saying, "Electrics attract objects of
every kind; they never repel." This error reminds
one of Gilbert's own saying that "Men of acute intelligence,
without actual knowledge of facts, and in the
absence of experiment, easily slip and err." Just twenty-nine
years after Gilbert had penned this aphorism,
there appeared in Ferrara an extensive work on electric
and magnetic philosophy, by the Jesuit Cabeo, in which
this electrical repulsion was recognized and described.
Having rubbed one of his electrics, Cabeo noticed that
it attracted grains of dust at first and afterward repelled
them suddenly and violently. In the case of
threads, hairs or filaments of any kind, he observed that
they quivered a little before being flung away like
sawdust. This self-repelling property of electricity,
described in the year 1629, opened up a new field of
inquiry, which was actively explored by a number of
brilliant electricians in England and on the Continent.

This was especially the case after the building of the
first frictional machine by Otto von Guericke in 1672.
The burgomaster of Magdeburg had already acquired
European fame by the original and sensational experiments
on atmospheric pressure which he made in presence
of the Emperor and his nobles in solemn diet
assembled (1651). Von Guericke seems to have been
of a mind with Gilbert concerning writers on natural
science who treat their subjects "esoterically, miracle-mongeringly,
abstrusely, reconditely, mystically"; for he
affirms that "oratory, elegance of diction or skill in disputation
avails nothing in the field of natural science."

Von Guericke's machine consisted of a ball of sulphur,
with the hand of the operator or assistant as rubber.
Some years later, the sulphur ball was replaced
by Newton (some say Hauksbee) by a glass globe,
which, in turn, was exchanged for a glass cylinder by
Gordon, a Scotch Benedictine, who was Professor of
natural philosophy in the University of Erfurt. In 1755,
Martin de Planta, of Sus, in Switzerland, constructed a
plate-machine which was subsequently improved by
Ramsden of London. The frictional machine, as it was
rightly called, has been superseded by the influence
machine, a type of static generator which is at once
efficient, reliable and easy of operation. The best known
form for laboratory use is that of Wimshurst (1832-1903),
of London.

Andrew Gordon, the Scotch Benedictine to whom reference
has just been made, was a man of an inventive
turn of mind. Besides, the cylindrical electric machine
which he constructed, he devised several ingenious
pieces of electrical apparatus, among which are the
electric chimes usually ascribed to Franklin. They are
fully described in his Versuch einer Erklärung der Electricität,
published in 1745. On page 38, he says that
he was led to try an electrical method of ringing bells;
and then adds: "For this purpose I placed two small
wine-glasses near each other, one of which stood on an
electrified board, while the other, placed at a distance of
an inch from it, was connected with the ground. Between
the two, I suspended a little clapper by a silk thread,
which clapper was attracted by the
electrified glass and then repelled to
the grounded one, giving rise to a sound
as it struck each glass. As the clapper
adhered somewhat to the glasses, the
effect on the whole was not agreeable.
I, therefore, substituted two small metallic
gongs suspended one from an
electrified conductor and the other from a grounded rod,
the gongs being on the same level and one inch apart.
When the clapper was lowered and adjusted, it moved
at once to the electrified bell, from which it was driven
over to the other, and kept on moving to and fro, striking
the bell each time with pleasing effect until the
electrified bell lost its charge." In the illustration, a
is connected with the electrified conductor; b is the insulated
clapper; c the grounded gong.

Gordon's Electric Chimes, 1745


Gordon's book was published in Erfurt in 1745, while
the year 1752 is that in which Franklin applied the
chimes to his experimental rod to apprise him of the
approach of an electric storm, an application which was
original and quite in keeping with the practical turn of
mind that characterized our journeyman-printer, philosopher
and statesman. Unquestionably, Franklin had
all the ingenuity and constructive ability needed to
make such an appliance; but there is no evidence that
he actually invented it. Though Franklin neither claimed
nor disclaimed the chimes as his own, all his admirers
would have preferred less reticence on his part when
the discoveries and inventions of contemporary workers
in the electrical field were concerned. He had attained
sufficient eminence to permit him to look appreciatingly
and encouragingly on the efforts of others.

Gordon also invented a toy electric motor in which
rotation was effected by the reaction of electrified air-particles
escaping from a number of sharp points. One
of these motors consisted of a star of light rays cut from
a sheet of tin and pivoted at the center, with the ends
of the rays slightly bent aside and all in the same
direction. When electrified, Gordon noticed that the
star required no extraneous help to set it in motion. It
was a self-starting electric-motor. In the dark, the
points were tipped with light, and as they revolved
traced out a luminous circle which "could neither be
blown out nor decreased."

The reader will recognize in this description taken
from Gordon's Versuch, page 45, the electric whirl of
the lecture-table; Gordon's name is never associated
with it, but that of Hamilton (Hamilton's "fly" or
Hamilton's "mill") sometimes is!

This irrepressible monk seems to have been one of
the earliest electrocutors, for it is said that many an
innocent chaffinch fell victim to discharges from his
machine; and we would be disposed to think of him as
a wizard on learning that he ignited spirits by using an
electrified stream of water, to the astonishment and
mystification of the spectators.

Abbé Menon was kinder to the feathered tribe than
his black-cowled brother of Erfurt; he did not subject
them to a powerful discharge, but rather to a gentle
electrification for the purpose of determining what
physical or physiological effect the agent would have on
the animal system. The Abbé found that cats, pigeons,
sparrows and chaffinches lost weight by being electrified
for five or six hours at a time, from which he concluded
that electricity augments the slow, continuous perspiration
of animals. The same was found to take place
with the human body itself. The reader will remember
that Stephen Gray in 1730 suspended a boy by means of
silken cords for the purpose of electrification; Abbé
Nollet did the same, and doubtless his friend Abbé
Menon adopted a similar mode of insulation for complacent
electrical subjects. An easier mode of operating
would have been to make the child stand on a cake
of resin, the insulating property of which had been
discovered by Stephen Gray.

About this time, 1746, Franklin appears on the scene,
and though he devoted but nine years (1746-1755) of his
life to the study of electricity, he made discoveries in
that fascinating branch of human knowledge that will
hand his name down the centuries.

Franklin's life is interesting and instructive on account
of the difficulties which he met and overcame, for
his strength of will, tenacity of purpose, the philosophy
which he followed, his devotedness to science, and the
success which he achieved.

Our philosopher's moral code comprised the thirteen
virtues of temperance, silence, order, resolution, frugality,
industry, sincerity, justice, moderation, cleanliness,
tranquility, chastity and humility. To each of these
virtues Franklin attached a precept which makes edifying
reading even at the present day: temperance, eat
not to dullness, drink not to elation; silence, speak not
but what may benefit others or yourself, avoid trifling
conversation; order, let all your things have their
places, let each part of your business have its time; resolution,
resolve to perform what you ought, perform without
fail what you resolve; frugality, make no expense,
but do good to others or yourself, i.e., waste nothing;
industry, lose no time, be always employed in something
useful, cut off all unnecessary actions; sincerity, use no
hurtful deceit, think innocently and justly, and if you
speak, speak accordingly; justice, wrong no one by
doing injury or omitting the benefits that are your
duty; moderation, avoid extremes, forbear resenting
injuries so much as you think they deserve; cleanliness,
tolerate no uncleanliness in body, clothes or habitation;
tranquility, be not disturbed by trifles or accidents
common or unavoidable; chastity (no remark); humility,
imitate Jesus.

This last virtue seems to have given Franklin very
much concern; for he admits that he had the appearance
of humility, and immediately adds that in reality
there is no passion of the human breast so hard to subdue
as pride. He is shrewd enough to say that "even
if I could conceive that I had completely overcome it, I
should probably be proud of my humility." Like many
another, the virtue which gave him the most trouble
was order, and this never became conspicuously apparent
at any time of his long life.

In his endeavors after the higher life, he seems to
have been animated with the earnest spirit of the
ascetic who binds himself to strive after perfection as
laid down in the maxims and counsels of the Gospel.
It is not without surprise and perhaps a feeling too of
self-condemnation, that we read the means which he
adopted to reach a high moral standard. Taking for
granted that he had a true appreciation of right and
wrong, he did not see why he should not always act
according to the dictates of conscience. To improve
himself morally and advance in the higher life, he
adopted a means that should have proved effective.
Taking the first of the thirteen fundamental virtues,
he applied himself to its acquisition for a whole week
together, after which he took the second, then the
third, and so on with the rest. He thought that by
making daily acts of the virtue, it would become
habitual with him at the end of the week. When the
last of the thirteen virtues had received its share of
attention, he returned to the first one on the list and
proceeded round the cycle again. Being a man of purpose
and tenacity, he completed the circle of his chosen
virtues four times a year; subsequently he extended
the time of individual practise so as to take a whole
year for the course; and later on, he devoted several
years to the completion of his list.

As an aid in this work of self-betterment, Franklin
examined himself daily, registering his failures in a
little book which was ruled for the purpose, a column
being allowed for each day and a line for each of the
thirteen virtues. He naively tells us the result of this
exercise of daily introspection in these words: "I am
surprised to find myself so much fuller of faults than I
had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing them
diminish."

The evening examination of conscience was always
concluded by the following prayer written by Franklin
himself: "O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father!
merciful Guide! increase in me that wisdom which discovers
my truest interest. Strengthen my resolutions
to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my
kind offices to Thy other children as the only return in
my power for Thy continual favors to me."

An extensive reader, Franklin found in Thomson's
poems some lines that appealed to him very strongly
by the beauty of the sentiment expressed. He called
them "a little prayer," which he recited from time to
time:


"Father of light and life, Thou Lord Supreme,
Oh, teach me what is good; teach me Thyself.
Save me from folly, vanity and vice;
From every low pursuit; and fill my soul
With knowledge, conscious peace and virtue pure;
Sacred, substantial, never-failing bliss!"


His was a praiseworthy attempt at emancipating
himself from the thraldom of passion and raising himself
to the high plane of perfection required by the
Master when He said "Follow Me." Doubtless, as
time wore on, he must have felt as many before and
since, that the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

In his autobiography, Franklin attributes his success
in business not only to his self-control, uniformity of
conduct, philosophical indifference to slight or pique,
but also to his habits of frugality, the result in part of
his early training. "My original habits of frugality
continuing," he says, "and my father having frequently
repeated a proverb of Solomon, 'Seest thou a
man diligent in his business? he shall stand before
kings,' I from thence considered industry as a means of
obtaining wealth and distinction, which encouraged me,
tho' I did not think that I should ever literally stand before
kings, which, however, has since happened." Our
aged philosopher proceeds to tell us of his good fortune
with a little bit of pardonable vanity, to which, by the
way, he was never a great stranger, despite his philosophy,
acquired virtue, and staid character. Referring
to the kings of the earth, he informs us that he "stood
before five, and even had the honor of sitting down
with one to dinner."

An important event in Franklin's life was the founding
by him of the first public library in the country in
the year 1732. Though but twenty-six years of age, he
seems to have been as well aware as any of the millionaire
philanthropists of to-day, of the good that may
be accomplished among common people by providing
them with suitable reading matter. He watched with
eagerness the progress of his experiment and was
pleased with the success that crowned it. He observes
that such libraries "tend to improve the conversation of
Americans and to make common tradesmen and farmers
as intelligent (well-informed?) as most gentlemen from
other countries."

Peter Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society of
London, who had dealings with some Philadelphia
merchants, was led to take an active interest in the
library. This he did by sending over a number of books
and papers relating to electricity together with an
"electrical tube" with instructions for its use.

These literary and scientific contributions sent from
London from time to time, excited much interest among
the charter members of the Library Company, and
principally that of Franklin himself. He had heard
something of the new order of phenomena which was
just then engaging the attention of European physicists.
In the summer of 1746, while on a visit to Boston, his
native place, he assisted at a lecture on electricity by a
certain Dr. Spence, a Scotchman, who sought to illustrate
the properties of electrified bodies by such experiments
as could be made with glass tubes and suitable rubbers,
the rudimentary apparatus available at the time. Franklin
was impressed by what he saw and heard, even
though he indulged in a little destructive criticism when
he said that the experiments were "imperfectly made,"
because the lecturer was "not very expert." When
Franklin wrote those words, he knew by repeated and
painful experience the difficulty of getting satisfactory
results from rubbing glass tubes or rotating glass globes,
owing to the provoking attraction which plain, untreated
glass has for moisture. Knowing this, he might have
been less severe in his strictures on his friend, the
peripatetic electrician.

It is evident, however, that the experiments which he
witnessed surprised and pleased him, for, having shortly
afterward received some electrical tubes together with
a paper of instructions, from his London friend, Peter
Collinson, he set to work for himself without delay.
We may well say of him that what his right hand found
to do, he did calmly, but with all his might. A twelve-month
had not elapsed before he wrote: "I never was
engaged in any study that so totally engrossed my
attention and time as this has lately done; for, what
with making experiments when I can be alone and repeating
them to my friends and acquaintance who, from
the novelty of the thing, come continually in crowds to
see them, I have had little leisure for anything else."
(1747.)

Here we see the calm, persistent character of the
philosopher united with the affability and communicativeness
of the gentleman.

For the sake of encouraging others as well, perhaps,
as through a sense of personal relief, Franklin had a
number of long tubes of large bore blown at the local
glass-house, which tubes he distributed to his friends
that they, too, might engage in research work. In this
way, rubbing and rubbing of an energetic kind became
quite an occupation in the Franklin circle. Kinnersley,
whose name still survives in works on static electricity
in connection with an electric "thermometer" which
he devised, was among the band of ardent workers who
ungrudgingly acknowledged Franklin's superior acumen,
comprehensive grasp of detail and wondrous insight
into the mechanism of the new phenomena. If we say
that Franklin was not a genius, it is only for the purpose
of adding that even in those early electrical studies
he displayed an uncommon amount of the unlimited
capacity for taking pains which is said to be associated
with that brilliant gift. He tested all his results with
great care and in a variety of ways before accepting
any of them as final; and considered his explanations of
them provisional, being ever ready to modify them or
give them up altogether if shown to conflict with the
simple workings of nature.

As early as 1733, the refined and tactful Dufay, in
France, showed by numerous experiments on woods,
stones, books, oranges and metals that all solid bodies
were susceptible of electrification. This was a notable
advance which swept away Gilbert's classification of
bodies into electrics and non-electrics. The French
physicist soon drew from his observations the conclusion
that electrification produced by friction is of two kinds,
to which he applied the terms vitreous and resinous, the
former being developed when glass is rubbed with silk
and the latter when amber or common sealing-wax is
rubbed with flannel. He noticed, too, that silk strings
repelled each other when both were touched either with
excited glass or sealing-wax; but that they attracted
each other when touched one with glass and the other
with sealing-wax. From these observations, he deduced
the electrostatic laws, that similarly electrified bodies
attract while dissimilarly electrified bodies repel each
other.

The law of distance was discovered later by Coulomb,
who, in 1785, showed that the law of repulsion as well as
of attraction between two electrified particles varies inversely
as the square of the distance. In the year 1750,
the law of the inverse square for magnets was stated by
John Michell, who expressed it by saying that the "attraction
and repulsion decrease as the square of the
distance from the respective poles increases." Michell
was fourth wrangler of his year (1748-9), Fellow of
Queen's College, Cambridge, and inventor of the torsion
balance, which, however, he did not live to use; but
which, in the hands of Cavendish, yielded important
results on the mean density of the earth. Coulomb probably
re-invented the "balance" and applied the practical,
laboratory instrument which he made it, to the study
of the quantitative laws of electricity and magnetism.

To observe and correlate phenomena is the special
work of the physicist; to speculate on ultimate causes is
the privilege of the philosopher. Dufay was both. The
theory which he offered was a simple one, even if
untrue to nature. It was a good working hypothesis
for the time being.

According to this theory, there are two distinct, independent
electrical fluids mutually attractive but self-repelling.
With that postulate, Dufay was able to offer
a plausible explanation of a great many phenomena
that puzzled the electricians of the time.

Franklin, however, held a different view; rejecting
the dual nature of electricity, he propounded his one-fluid
theory, which was found equally capable of explaining
electrical phenomena. A body having an
excess of the fluid was said to be positively charged,
while one with a deficit was said to be negatively
charged. The sign plus was used in one case and the
sign minus in the other; and just as two algebraical
quantities of equal magnitude but opposite sign give
zero when added together, so a conductor to which
equal quantities of positive and negative electricity
would be given would be in the neutral state. The
Franklinian theory was welcomed in England, Germany
and Italy, but it met with opposition in France from the
brilliant Abbé Nollet and the followers of Dufay.

Each of the rival theories affords a mental conception
of the forces in play and also a consistent explanation
of the resulting phenomena. Their simplicity, and, at
the same time, the comprehensiveness of explanation
which they afford, will continue to give them a place in
our text-books for many years to come.

Efforts are being made to apply the electronic theory
to the various phenomena of electrostatics, the electron
being the smallest particle of electricity that can have
separate, individual existence. It is many times smaller
than the hydrogen atom, the smallest of chemical
atoms, and it possesses all the properties of negative electricity.
By the loss of one or more electrons, a body
becomes positively electrified, whereas by the acquisition
of one or more electrons it becomes negatively electrified.
The electron at rest gives rise to the phenomena
of electrostatics; in motion, it gives rise to electrical
currents, electromagnetism and electric radiation.

We do not know what led Franklin to call positive
the electrification of glass when rubbed with silk, and
negative that of sealing-wax when rubbed with flannel.
If he meant to imply that positive is the more important
of the two, he erred, for many reasons can be
given to show the preponderating influence of negative
electricity; but it is too late now to change the terminology.

If asked to point out differences between the physical
effects of positive and negative electrification, we would
refer to the positive brush, which is finer and much
more developed than the negative; to the Wimshurst
machine, with its positive brushes on one side and negative
"beads" on the other; to the positive charge acquired
by a clean plate of zinc when exposed to ultraviolet
light; to the ordinary vacuum tube in which
there is a violet glow at the cathode end or negative terminal;
to Crookes's tubes, X-ray tubes and other high
vacuum tubes, in which electrified particles, Kelvin's
molecular torrent, are shot out from the negative electrode
with great velocity; and to arc-lamps using a
direct current in which the plus carbon is hollowed out
crater-like, has the higher temperature and wastes away
twice as fast as the negative.

The year 1746 is an annus mirabilis in the history of
electricity, for it was in the January of that year that an
attempt to electrify water by Musschenbroek, of Leyden,
led to the discovery of the principle of the electrostatic
condenser. Whatever may be thought of the
claim for priority put forward in favor of Dean von
Kleist, of Cammin in Pomerania, or of Cunæus, of Leyden,
it is certain that the discovery became known
throughout Europe by the startling announcement and
sensational description given of it by Musschenbroek, a
renowned professor of a renowned university. He was
not only surprised but terror-stricken by the effect of
the electric energy which he had unconsciously stored up
in his little phial; for after telling his French friend
Réaumur, the physicist, that he felt the commotion in
his arms, shoulders and chest, he added that he would
not take another shock for the whole kingdom of France!
A resolution destined to be broken, like so many others
before and since.

Modern Form of Leyden Jar with Movable Coatings


Very different was the sentiment of Bose, Professor
of Physics in the University of Wittenberg, who is credited
with saying that he would like to die
by the electric shock, that he might live
in the memoirs of the French Academy
of Sciences.

The Leyden jar became at once the
scientific curiosity and universal topic
of discussion of the time; and not only
was it the curiosity, but also the crux
of the day, puzzling investigators, perplexing
philosophers and giving rise to
animated controversies. The mystery
was soon dispelled, however, when
Franklin began in 1747 his searching
inquiry into the electric conditions of
each element of the jar. Nothing escaped
his subtle mind and nothing was
left undone by his deft hand. The evidence of experiment
and the logic of facts carried at last conviction
even with Londoners and Parisians, who were wont to
look upon Americans as mere colonists, who had neither
time nor opportunity for scientific pursuits, being obliged
to hew their way through virgin forests or drive the
roving Indian back from their frontiers into the wilds
of the West. The theory of the Leyden jar given by
Franklin 160 years ago has stood the test of time. It
has met with universal acceptance; and, despite our
manifold advances, but little of permanent value has
been added to it.

It is very interesting to follow the main lines of this
magnificent research. Franklin electrifies, in the usual
way, water contained in a small flask, complaisantly
taking the shock on completing the circuit. To find
where the charge resides, whether in the hand of the
operator, as some said, or in the water, as others maintained,
he again electrifies the water and pours it into
another flask, which fails, however, to give a shock,
thus showing that the charge had not been carried over
with the water. Convinced that the charge was still
somewhere in the first phial, he carefully poured water
into it again; and found, to his intense satisfaction, that
it was capable of giving an excellent shock. It was now
clear to him that the energy of the charge was either in
the hand of the experimenter or in the glass itself, or
in both. To determine this nice point, he proceeds to
construct a "jar" which could easily be taken to pieces.
For this purpose, he selected a pane of glass; and, laying
it on the extended hand, placed a sheet of lead on
its upper surface. The leaden plate was then electrified;
and when touched with the finger, a spark was
seen and a shock felt. By the addition of another plate
to the lower surface, the shocking power of this simple
condenser was increased. In this efficient form he had
a readily dissectible condenser, which allowed him to
throw off and replace the coatings at will, and thereby
to prove beyond cavil that the seat of the stored-up electric
energy is not in the conductors, but in the glass
itself. This was a discovery of the first magnitude and
one destined to associate the name of Franklin with
those of the most eminent electricians down the ages.
Fig. 11 shows the modern form of the jar with movable
coatings.





Fig. 12
Three Coated Panes in series


In the "fulminating" pane, as it came to be called,
we have one of the eleven elements of Franklin's historic
battery of 1748. It is interesting to notice that he
was accustomed to connect his "panes" in series while
charging (Fig. 12), but that he preferred to join similar
coatings together, that is, to couple them in "parallel"
(Fig. 13), for powerful discharges. Fig. 14 shows three
jars in "parallel."



Fig. 13
Three Panes in Parallel


Later on, he arranged Leyden jars so that the inside
coating of one could be hooked to the outside coating of
another, the first of the series hanging down from the
prime conductor of the machine, while the last one was
grounded. "What is driven out of the tail of the first,"
he quaintly says, "serves to charge the second; what
is driven out of the second serves to charge the third,
and so on." This has become known as the "cascade"
method of charging a battery, owing to the flow of electricity
from one jar to the next (Fig. 15). Electricians,
however, have discarded the picturesque "cascade" for
the prosaic term of "series" or "tandem" arrangement.





Fig. 14
Three Jars in Parallel


Franklin also noticed that a phial cannot be charged
while standing on wax or on glass, or even while hanging
from the prime conductor, unless communication be
formed between its outer coating and the floor, the reason
given being that "the jar will not suffer a charging
unless as much fire can go out of it one way as is thrown
in by the other." (1748.)



Fig. 15
Three Jars in Cascade


Following his very ingenious Philadelphia friend and
co-worker, Kinnersley, he varies the mode of charging
by electrifying the outside of the jar and grounding the
inner coating; for "the phial will be electrified as
strongly if held by the hook and the coating applied to
the globe as when held by the coating and the hook
applied to the globe." (1748.)

The globe here referred to is the glass globe of Franklin's
frictional machine of American make, which, when
rotated, was electrified positively by contact with the
hand or with a leather rubber. Franklin also used a
sulphur ball or "brimstone" globe, and observed that
the electrification produced on it differed in kind from
that developed on the glass globe. (1752.)

It may here be stated that the first to use a leather
cushion as a substitute for the hand in the frictional
machine, was Winkler, of Leipzig (1745); the efficiency
of the rubber was increased by Canton, of London, who
covered it with an amalgam of tin and mercury (1762).
Bose, of Wittenberg, had previously added the prime-conductor,
which greatly augmented the electrical capacity
and output of the machine.

In 1750 Franklin imitated the effect of lightning on
the compasses of a ship by the action of a jar discharge
on an unmagnetized steel needle. "By electricity," he
says, "we have frequently given polarity to needles and
reversed it at pleasure."

Similar experiments are made to-day in every lecture-course
on static electricity; but the experimenter,
when wise, does not announce beforehand which end of
the needle will be north and which south, as he is just
as likely to be wrong as right, the uncertainty being
due to the fact that the discharge of a Leyden jar is
not a current of electricity in one direction, but rather
a few sudden rushes or rapid surgings of electricity to
and fro; in other words, it is oscillatory in character
instead of being continuous in one direction.

Franklin did not know this; although he made a very
pertinent remark in 1749 when he likened the mechanical
condition of the glass of a charged jar to that of a
bent rod or a stretched spring. "So, a straight spring,"
he says, "when forcibly bent must, to restore itself,
contract that side which in the bending was extended,
and extend that side which was contracted." Franklin
knew, of course, that the bent rod, when released, would
swing to and fro a few times before settling down to
its state of rest; but he failed to see the analogy between
it and the strained glass of the charged Leyden
jar.

It is to Joseph Henry (1799-1878), the Faraday of
America, that we owe the recognition and statement of
the oscillatory character of the discharge from Leyden
jars and condensers generally. He discovered and published
this cardinal fact in 1842. His words deserve
recording. "The discharge, whatever may be its nature,
is not correctly represented (employing for simplicity
the theory of Franklin) by the single transfer of
an imponderable fluid from one side of the jar to the
other; the phenomenon requires us to admit the existence
of a principal discharge in one direction and then several
reflex actions backward and forward, each more feeble
than the preceding, until equilibrium is attained."[8] The
italics are Prof. Henry's.

It is precisely this oscillatory character of the spark-discharge
that enables us to send out trains of electric
waves into the all-pervading ether, and thus to communicate,
by "wireless," with remote stations.

Having conclusively proved that the energy of a
charged condenser resides in the dielectric, Franklin
next tries to find whether "the electric matter" in the
case of conductors is limited to the surface or whether
it penetrates to an appreciable depth. To ascertain this,
he insulates a silver fruit-can and brings a charged ball,
held by a silk thread, into contact with the outer surface.
On testing after removal, he found that the ball
retained some of its charge, whilst it lost all if allowed to
touch the bottom of the vessel. Surprised at this unexpected
difference, he repeated the experiment again and
again, only to find the ball every time without a trace
of charge after contact with the interior of the vessel.
This perplexed and puzzled him. "The fact is singular,"
he says, "and you require the reason? I do not know
it. I find a frank acknowledgment of one's ignorance
is not only the easiest way to get rid of a difficulty, but
the likeliest way to obtain information, and therefore I
practice it. I think it an honest policy. Those who
affect to be thought to know everything, often remain
long ignorant of many things that others could and
would instruct them in, if they appeared less conceited."

This was in 1755. Cavendish in 1773 and Coulomb in
1788 independently attacked the same problem; and having
proved by their classic experiments that a static
charge is limited to the surface of conductors, it was
but a step to infer that such a distribution of electricity
implies that the law of force between two elements of
charge, or between two point-charges, is the law of the
inverse square of the distance.

It will also be remembered that Faraday, not knowing
what had been accomplished eighty years before in
Philadelphia, used for one of his best-known experiments
an ice-pail, into which he lowered an electrified
ball for the purpose of showing the exact equality of
the induced and the inducing charge. The similarity of
apparatus and mode of procedure are remarkable.

In pursuing his work, Franklin placed a charged jar
on a cake of wax and other insulating materials, and drew
sparks from it by touching successively the knob and
the outer coating, repeating the process a great number
of times to his infinite delight. He next attached a
brass rod to the outside, bending it and bringing the
other end close to the knob (Fig. 16) connected with the
inner coating. Between these two he suspended a leaden
ball by a silk thread and found, as he expected, that it
played to and fro between the terminals for
a considerable time. Observe that we have
here a definite mass maintained in a state
of reciprocating motion by a series of electric
attractions and repulsions. We have
in fact an electro-motor, closely resembling
the star and the chimes of Gordon, the
Benedictine, 1745; a mere toy, if you will,
but still a remarkable invention. We repeat the same
experiment to-day only with a little more harmony, by
substituting for the knobs two little bells, which emit
a soft, musical note when struck by the interhanging
clapper.





Fig. 16
Discharge by Alternate Contacts


This experiment has further significance, for, like Gordon's
chimes, it is an instance of the conveyance of electricity
from one point of space to another by means of a
material carrier, a mode of transfer which has since
been called "electric convection," the full meaning
of which was not revealed until Rowland (1848-1901),
made his famous experiment of 1876 in the laboratory
of the University of Berlin with a highly-charged,
rapidly-revolving, ebonite disc. It was apropos of this
experiment that the illustrious Clerk Maxwell, of the
University of Cambridge, wrote to his friend, Professor
Tait, of Edinburgh, saying that:


"The mounted disc of ebonite
Had whirled before, but whirled in vain;
Rowland of Troy, that doughty knight,
Convection currents did obtain,
In such a disc, of power to wheedle
From its loved north, the needle."


We may here say that Franklin was no stranger to
the work done by the electrical pioneers of the Old
World, his diligent London friend, Peter Collinson,
keeping him advised by means of letters, books and
pamphlets, in which inspiration and practical hints must
have been found. He certainly was well acquainted
with the achievements of Dr. Watson and Dr. Bevis, of
London, as well as with the theories and experiments of
Dufay and Abbé Nollet in Paris. It is germane to the
subject to say that Dr. Bevis used mercury and iron filings
for the inner coating of his jars, as well as sheet
lead for both. He also experimented with coated panes
of glass instead of jars. About this, Franklin wrote to
Collinson: "I perceive by the ingenious Mr. Watson's
last book, lately received, that Dr. Bevis had used,
before we had, panes of glass to give a shock; though
till that book came to hand, I thought to have communicated
it to you as a novelty." (1748.)

Franklin gave way to a little pleasant humor when, in
1748, he proposed to wind up the "electrical season" by
a banquet à la Lucullus, to be given to a few of his
friends and fellow-workers, not in a sumptuously decorated
hall, but al fresco, on the banks of the Schuylkill.
"A turkey is to be killed for our dinner by the electrical
shock," he wrote, "and roasted by the electrical jack
before a fire kindled by the electrical bottle, when the
healths of all the famous electricians in England,
Holland, France and Germany are to be drunk in electrified
bumpers under the discharge of guns fired from the
electrical battery."

It is hardly to be supposed that such an elaborate
program was carried out. Indeed the difficulty of
preparing the apparatus and getting it ready for action
on the banks of a river were formidable enough to say
the least. Franklin, however, had a Leyden battery
capable of doing considerable electrocution, for with two
jars of six gallons capacity each, he knocked six men to
the ground; the same two jars sufficed to kill a hen outright,
whereas it required five, he tells us, to kill a
turkey weighing ten pounds.

The "electrical bumper" was a wine-glass containing
an allowance, let us say, of some favorite brand and
charged in the usual way. On approaching the lips the
two coatings would be brought within striking-distance
and a spark would take place, if not to the delight of the
performer, at least to the amusement of the on-lookers.
It was subsequently remarked that guests whose upper
lip was adorned with a moustache could quaff the nectar
with impunity, as every bristle would play the part of a
filiform lightning-rod and prevent the apprehended, disruptive
discharge!

Not quite so humorous was his suggestion of a hammock
to be used by timid people during an electric
storm: "A hammock or swinging-bed, suspended by
silk cords equally distant from the walls on every side,
and from the ceiling and floor above and below, affords
the safest situation a person can have in any room
whatever; and which, indeed, may be deemed quite free
from danger of any stroke of lightning." (1767.)

In his experiments on puncturing bodies by the spark-discharge,
Franklin does not fail to notice the double
burr produced when paper is used.[9] His words are:

"When a hole is struck through pasteboard by the
electrified jar, if the surfaces of the pasteboard are not
confined or compressed, there will be a bur raised all
round the hole on both sides the pasteboard, for the bur
round the outside of the hole is the effect of the explosion
every way from the centre of the stream and not an
effect of direction." (1753.) The spelling is Franklin's
unreformed.

The to-and-fro nature of the discharge was thought,
at a time, to account satisfactorily for the burr raised on
each side of the pasteboard; but Trowbridge, of Harvard,
has shown that even a unidirectional discharge,
such as can be obtained by inserting a wet string or any
high resistance in the circuit, would produce a double
burr, from which we infer, confirming Franklin, that
this effect of the discharge is caused by the sudden
expansion of air within the paper itself.

By the year 1749, Franklin had reached the conclusion
that the lightning of the skies is identical with that of
our laboratories, basing his belief on the following analogies
which he enumerates in the notes or "minutes"
which he kept of his experiments: "The electric fluid
agrees with lightning in these particulars: (1) Giving
light; (2) color of the light; (3) crooked direction; (4)
swift motion; (5) being conducted by metals; (6) crack
or noise in exploding; (7) rending bodies it passes
through; (8) destroying animals; (9) melting metals;
(10) firing inflammable substances; and (11) sulphurous
smell."

But although he felt the full force of the analogical
argument, Franklin knew that the matter could not be
finally settled without an appeal to experiment; and accordingly
he adds: "The electric fluid is attracted by
points; we do not know whether this property is in
lightning. But since they agree in all the particulars
wherein we can already compare them, is it not probable
that they agree likewise in this? Let the experiment
be made." (1749.)

In writing to Collinson in July, 1750, he tells his London
friend how the experiment may be made: "On
the top of some high tower or steeple, place a kind of
sentry-box       big enough to contain a man       and an
electrical stand. From the middle of the stand let an
iron rod rise and pass, bending out of the door, and then
upright 20 or 30 feet, pointed very sharp at the end. If
the electrical stand be kept clean and dry, a man standing
on it, when such clouds are passing low, might be
electrified and afford sparks, the rod drawing fire to him
from the cloud."

Collinson brought some of Franklin's letters to the
notice of fellow-members of the Royal Society with a
view to their insertion in the Philosophical Transactions
of that learned body; but even his epoch-making letter
to Dr. Mitchell, of London, on the identity of lightning
and electricity, was dismissed with derisive laughter.
The Royal Society made amends in due time for their
contemptuous treatment of the American philosopher by
electing him member of the Society and by awarding
him the Copley medal in 1753.

Disappointed as he was, Collinson collected Franklin's
letters and published them under the title of New Experiments
and Observations on Electricity made at
Philadelphia in America. The pamphlet appeared in
1751, and was immediately translated into French by M.
d'Alibard at the request of the great naturalist Count de
Buffon.

The experiments described in the pamphlet, and
especially that of the pointed conductor, were taken up
in Paris with great enthusiasm by de Buffon himself, by
d'Alibard, a botanist of distinction, and by de Lor, a
professor of physics. Following out the instructions
given by Franklin, they were all able to report success:
d'Alibard on May 10th, de Lor on May 18th, and de
Buffon on May 19th, 1752.

De Buffon erected his rod on the tower of his château
at Montbar; de Lor, over his house in Paris, and d'Alibard,
at his country seat at Marly, a little town eighteen
miles from Paris. D'Alibard was not at home on the
eventful afternoon of May 10th; but before leaving
Marly, he had drilled a certain Coiffier in what he
should do in case an electric storm came on during his
absence. Though a hardy and resolute old soldier and
proud of the confidence placed in him, Coiffier grew alarmed
at the long and noisy discharges which he drew
from the insulated rod on the afternoon of May 10th.
While the storm was still at its height he sent for the
Prior of the place, Raulet by name, who hastened to the
spot, followed by many of his parishioners. After witnessing
a number of brilliant and stunning discharges,
the priest drew up an account of the incident and
sent it, at once, by Coiffier himself to d'Alibard, who
was then in Paris. Without delay d'Alibard prepared a
memoir on the subject which he communicated to the
Académie des Sciences three days later, viz.: on May
13th. In the concluding paragraph, the polished academician
pays a graceful tribute to the philosopher of the
Western World:

"It follows from all the experiments and observations
contained in the present paper, and more especially
from the recent experiment at Marly-la-ville, that the
matter of lightning is, beyond doubt, the same as that
of electricity; it has become a reality, and I believe that
the more we realize what he (Franklin) has published
on electricity, the more will we acknowledge the great
debt which physical science owes him."

We may, in passing, correct the error of those who
credit French physicists with having originated the idea
of the pointed conductor. Such writers should read the
words of d'Alibard in the beginning of his memoir,
where he says: "En suivant la route que M. Franklin
nous a tracée, j'ai obtenu une satisfaction complète";
that is, "In following the way traced out by Franklin,
I have met with complete success." To Franklin, therefore,
belongs the idea of the pointed rod of 1750, which
became the lightning conductor of subsequent years;
to the Parisian savants belongs the great distinction of
having been the first to make the experiment and verify
the Franklinian view of the identity of the lightning
of our skies with the electricity of our laboratories.

Franklin had precise ideas on the action of his pointed
conductors, clearly recognizing their twofold function:
(1) that of preventing a dangerous rise of potential by
disarming the cloud; and (2) that of conveying the discharge
to earth, if struck. In some of his letters, he
complains of people who concentrate their attention on
the preventive function, forgetting the other entirely.
"Wherever my opinion is examined in Europe," he
wrote in 1755, "nothing is considered but the probability
of these rods preventing a stroke, which is only a
part of the use I proposed for them; and the other part,
their conducting a stroke which they may happen not
to prevent, seems to be totally forgotten, though of
equal importance and advantage."

A favorite illustration of Franklin's showing the discharging
power of points, consisted in insulating a cannon
ball against which rested a pellet of cork, hung by
a silk thread. On electrifying the ball, the cork flies
off and remains suspended at a distance, falling back at
once, as soon as a needle is brought near the ball. (1747.)

He also used tassels consisting of
fifteen or twenty long threads (Fig.
17), and even cotton-fleece, the filaments
of which stand out when electrified,
but come together when a
pointed rod is held underneath. He
also noticed that the filaments do not
collapse when the point of the rod is
covered with a small ball. (1762.)

Tassel of Long Threads or Light Strips of Paper


Franklin's views on lightning-rods met with some
opposition in France from the brilliant Abbé Nollet, and
in England from Dr. Benjamin Wilson. The latter was
mainly instrumental in bringing about the famous controversy
of "Points vs. Knobs." In 1772, a committee
was appointed by the Royal Society to consider the best
means of protecting the powder-magazines at Purfleet
from lightning. On the committee with Dr. Wilson
were Henry Cavendish, the distinguished chemist and
physicist, and Sir John Pringle, President of the Royal
Society. The report favored sharp conductors against
blunt ones advocated by Dr. Wilson. Five years later,
in 1777, the question was again brought up, and again
the new committee decided in favor of pointed terminals,
convinced "that the experiments and reasons
made and alleged to the contrary by Mr. Wilson were
inconclusive."

Dr. Wilson, being a man of influence, succeeded in
having his views taken up by the Board of Ordnance.
It has been remarked that this controversy would never
have attracted attention but for the fact that the discoverer
of the effect of points was Franklin. He was
an American and the dispute with the colonies was then
at its height. The war of the Revolution had begun,
and the British forces had already met with serious reverses.
No patriot could, therefore, admit any good in
points. George III. took sides, decreed that the points
on the royal conductors at Kew should be covered with
balls, and ordered Sir John Pringle to support Dr. Wilson.
Sir John gave the dignified answer: "Sire, I
cannot reverse the laws and operations of nature"; to
which the King, incensed that so incompetent a man
should hold such an important office, replied: "Then,
Sir John, perhaps you had better resign," which Sir
John did.

A wit of the time put the matter epigrammatically
when he wrote:


"While you, great George, for knowledge hunt
And sharp conductors change to blunt,
The nation's out of joint;
Franklin a wiser course pursues,
And all your thunder useless views
By keeping to the point."


It was in connection with this heated controversy that
Franklin wrote the following admirable words:

"I have never entered into any controversy in defence
of my philosophical opinions. I leave them to take
their chance in the world. If they are right, truth and
experience will support them; if wrong, they ought to
be refuted and rejected. The King's changing his
pointed conductors for blunt ones is, therefore, a matter
of small importance to me."

It was not until September, 1752, that Franklin raised
a rod over his own house. This experimental conductor
was made of iron fitted with a sharp steel point and
rising seven or eight feet above the roof, the other end
being buried five feet in the ground. In order to avoid
useless personal displacement, Franklin, the economist
of time, made an automatic annunciator similar to that
devised by Gordon in 1745, and described by Watson in
his Sequel, 1746, to apprize him of the advent of a good
thunder-gust. Instead of making the rod of one continuous
length, it was divided on the staircase, opposite
his chamber door, the ends being drawn apart to a horizontal
distance of a few inches. Screwing a pair of tiny
gongs to the ends, he suspended between them a brass
ball, held by a silk thread, to act as clapper. Whenever
a thundercloud came hovering by, the bells began to
ring, thereby summoning the philosopher to his "laboratory"
on the staircase.

Franklin's rod, erected over his house in the summer
of 1752, was evidently intended by him for experimental
rather than protective purposes. There is no doubt
whatever in his mind about the use of such pointed conductors
for the protection of buildings and ships against
the destructive effects of lightning. He expressly says,
in an article printed in Poor Richard's Almanack for
1753, that "It has pleased God in His infinite goodness
to mankind, to discover to them the means of securing
their habitations and other buildings from mischief by
thunder and lightning. The method is this: provide a
small iron rod (it may be made of the rod-iron used by
the nailers), but of such a length, that one end being
3 ft. or 4 ft. in the moist ground, the other may be
6 ft. or 8 ft. above the highest part of the building.
To the upper end of the rod fasten about a foot of brass-wire,
the size of a common knitting needle, sharpened
to a fine point; the rod may be secured to the house by
a few small staples. If the house or barn be long, there
may be a rod and point at each end, and a middling wire
along the ridge from one to the other. A house thus
furnished will not be damaged by lightning, it being attracted
by the points and passing through the metal into
the ground without hurting anything. Vessels also,
having a sharp-pointed rod fixed on the top of their
masts, with a wire from the foot of the rod reaching
down round one of the shrouds to the water, will not be
hurt by lightning."

It is well known, as Dr. Rotch, Director of the Blue
Hill Observatory, recently pointed out, that the matter
for these almanacs was prepared by Franklin himself
under the pen-name of Richard Saunders. As the above
passage appeared in the almanac for 1753, it is obvious
that it must have been ready sometime toward the end of
1752. Furthermore, we know that it was actually in
the hands of the printer in the middle of October of that
year, for the Pennsylvania Gazette of Oct. 19th says that
the almanac was then in press and that it would be on
sale shortly. Whence it follows that the year 1752 is
the year of the invention of the lightning rod, and not
1753 or 1754 as often stated.

The instructions given by Franklin include all the essentials
necessary for the erection of a lightning conductor.
It may be made of iron or copper, flat or round,
but must make good "sky" and good "earth." The
former condition is secured by screwing to the top of
the rod either copper or platinum terminals ending in
sharp points; and the latter, by burying the lower end
deep in moist soil. Between "sky" and "earth" the
rod must be continuous.

The function of the rod is twofold, as Franklin well
recognized, preventive and preservative. It prevents
the stroke, under ordinary conditions, by the action of
the points, which send off copious streams of air and
dust particles electrified oppositely to that of the cloud.
Even at a distance, the dangerous potential of the cloud
is reduced by these convection currents and the stroke
ordinarily averted. It is clear that ten points are
more efficacious than one, and fifty more than five.
Hence the number of points which we see distributed
over the higher and more conspicuous parts of a building,
all of which are carefully connected with the lightning
conductor.

However well a building may theoretically be protected,
conditions will occasionally arise when the rod
will inevitably be struck; its preservative function then
comes into play, by which it carries the energy of the
disruptive discharge safely to earth.

The experience of more than a century shows that
the lightning-rod affords protection in the great majority
of cases; but it would be at least a mild exaggeration to
say that it never failed, even when properly constructed.

At first, the erection of lightning-rods was opposed in
the New World as well as in the Old: some based their
opposition to the novelty on religious grounds, saying
that, as lightning and thunder are tokens of divine
wrath, it would be impious to interfere in any way with
their manifestations. This objection was met by saying
that for a parity of reason we should avoid protecting
ourselves against the inclemencies of the weather.

Others opposed the use of the rods on the score that
they invited or attracted the flash, which was answered
by saying that they attract lightning as much as a rain-pipe
attracts a shower, and no more.

The death of Professor Richmann, of the University
of St. Petersburg, also tended to retard the adoption of
the rod for the protection of buildings; but the invalidity
of that objection became apparent when the circumstances
of the accident became known. Richmann's
conductor was like d'Alibard's (1751), an experimental
rod, and as such was insulated at the lower end. It
was, therefore, not a lightning-rod at all, inasmuch as
it was not grounded. On August 6th, 1753, during a
violent electric storm, Richmann happened to be close
to his exploring rod observing the indications of a
roughly-made electrometer, when a sharp thunder-clap
was heard, and at the same instant a ball of fire was
seen by Richmann's assistant to dart from the apparatus
and strike the head of the unfortunate Professor,
who fell over on a near-by chest and expired instantly.
His assistant was stunned for a while. On regaining
consciousness, he ran to the aid of the Professor; but it
was too late, the body was lifeless.

In recording this tragic event, Priestley, the historian
of electricity, says that, "It is not given to every electrician
to die in so glorious a manner as the justly
envied Richmann."

For one, we do not "envy" Professor Richmann's
fate, and we think that the phrase "tragic manner"
would better suit the circumstances of his death than
the "glorious manner" of Dr. Priestley.

Risks of a similar character were taken by Franklin
in Philadelphia, de Romas in Bordeaux, and d'Alibard's
representative at Marly, when experimenting with kites
and insulated rods; they took their lives in their hands,
though they may not have thought so.

A few years ago, Sir William Preece said that a man
might with impunity "clasp a copper rod an inch in
diameter, the bottom of which is well connected with
moist earth, while the top of it receives a violent flash
of lightning; the conductor might even be surrounded
by gunpowder in the heaviest storm without risk or
danger."

It is not on record that the English electrician ever
clasped a lightning conductor or even stood in close
proximity to one during an electric storm. The above
statement was as sensational as it was unwise and foolhardy.
The neighborhood of a rod during a storm is a
zone of danger, owing to the electrical surgings which
are set up in it, and, as such, is to be avoided.

The death of Richmann caused quite a sensation
throughout Europe, and naturally the lightning-rod came
in for severe condemnation. Among the memoirs to
which the fatality gave rise was one written in the heart
of Moravia and addressed to the celebrated Euler,
Director of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin. The
writer was a monk of the Premonstratensian Order,
whose field of labor was at Prenditz.

In the year 1754, this country priest made experiments
with lightning conductors on a scale that transcended
anything done in Paris, London or Philadelphia.
The accompanying illustrations show the conductor
which Divisch (also Diwisch) raised at Prenditz (also
Brenditz) in the summer of that year to demonstrate
publicly the efficacy of such apparatus in breaking up
thunder-clouds and neutralizing the destructive energy
pent up in their electric charges. Prenditz, it would
appear, suffered severely from electric storms; and it
was mainly for the safety of the locality that the good
priest devoted himself with earnestness to the study of
electrical phenomena.

As such a man deserves to live in the memory of
posterity, we have sought out the leading facts of his
career mainly from Father Alphons Zák, of Pernegg,
in Lower Austria, a distinguished writer of the Order
to which Divisch belonged, and have woven such details
as we obtained from him and others into the simple
narrative that follows.



Fig. 18
Procopius Divisch


Procopius Divisch (Prokop Diwisch) was born on Aug. 1st, 1696, at
Helkowitz-Senftenberg in Bohemia. He spent his youth at Znaim, where he
studied the humanities and philosophy at the College conducted by the
Jesuit fathers in that Moravian city. In 1719, when in his twenty-third
year, he decided to quit the common ways of the world in order to lead
the higher life in the Premonstratensian Order at Kloster-Bruck. At the
ripe age of 30, Divisch was ordained priest, in 1726, after which he
taught philosophy and theology to classes of young aspirants to the
ecclesiastical state. In 1733 he went to the University of Salzburg and
won his double Doctorate in theology and philosophy. Three years later,
in 1736, he was appointed parish priest of Prenditz, a small Moravian
town on the road to Austerlitz, since of Napoleonic fame. Here he
remained for five years, returning in 1741 to Bruck as Prior of the
Kloster or monastery situated there. At the end of the Seven Years' War
of the Austrian succession, he quitted Bruck, in 1745, for his parish at
Prenditz, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in the
pastoral ministrations of his sacred office and in electrical
experimentation, of which he was very fond.

The curative property of the new agent was heralded
throughout Europe about this time in terms of unmeasured
praise. Some of Divisch's ailing parishioners,
believing him to be an expert in electrical manipulation,
applied to him for a little alleviation of their woes.
The good-hearted priest did not turn them away, but
thought it desirable to treat them to the therapeutic
effect of such sparks as he could get from his homemade
frictional machine. The results were various,
depending probably on the confidence and imagination
of the patient. Several remarkable cures seem to have
been effected either by the electric spark or by the
persuasive powers of the operator, or by both combined,
with the result that people far and wide were divided
in their opinion of the Pastor of Prenditz. Some physicians
said that he was interfering with their practice,
and even clergymen found fault with him for indulging
in work which they thought unsuited to the cloth. A
general impression, too, seems to have prevailed that
his electrical experiments, especially those with his
lightning conductor, were likely to prove harmful in
more ways than one.

On the other hand, Divisch had admirers in high
places, among whom were the Emperor Francis I. of Germany
and his imperial consort, Maria Theresa. Having
been invited to Vienna, Divisch repaired to the Austrian
capital, where, with the aid of Father Franz, another
electrical devotee, he gave a demonstration of the wonderful
capability of the new form of energy before the
grandees of the empire.

When he came to the electrical property of points, he
showed their discharging power in a very original way,
one which must have made his assistant uneasy for a
while. At times, the machine worked by Father Franz
gave excellent results; at others, it failed to generate.
It was noticed by the critical few that when the machine
failed, Divisch was close by; while when it worked
normally, he was at some distance away. After a
number of such alternations of success and failure
which sorely perplexed the assistant, himself a man of
renown in Vienna, Divisch explained the occurrence by
saying, with a merry twinkle in his eye, that the failure
of the machine to generate when he was close to it,
apparently seeking out the cause of the breakdown, was
due to a number of pin-like conductors which he had
concealed for the purpose in his peruke and which
neutralized the charge on the rotating generator!

The identity of the lightning of our skies with the
artificial electricity of our laboratories was suspected
by many before the middle of the eighteenth century.
Englishmen like Hauksbee, Hall, Gray, Freke, Martin
and Watson; Germans like Bose and Winkler, and
Frenchmen like Abbé Nollet, had already published
their suspicions and conjectures anent the matter.
Franklin, too, had indicated twelve points of analogy
between the two, in 1749, in his letter to Collinson, of
London. Though he felt the force of the analogical
agreement, he also felt that the matter could not be
definitely settled without an appeal to experiment. Accordingly,
he added: "The electric fluid is attracted by
points; we do not know whether this property is in
lightning. But since they agree in all the particulars
wherein we can already compare them, is it not probable
that they agree likewise in this? Let the experiment
be made."

The Divisch Lightning Conductor


The experiment was made by Franklin himself by means of his kite two
years later, in the summer of 1752, and also by the lightning-rod which
he erected over his own house in the autumn of the same year. Doubtless
Divisch heard of the marvelous effects obtained from d'Alibard's
insulated conductor at Marly; at any rate, he erected in an open space
at some little distance from his rectory at Prenditz, a lightning
conductor 130 feet in height. As will be seen from the illustration, it
bristled with points, for the Bohemian wizard argued rightly that five
points would be more efficient than one, and 50 more efficacious than
five. The weird-looking structure destined to ward off the lightning of
heaven had no less than 325 well-distributed points. Lodge says in his
Lightning Conductors: "Points to the sky are recognized as correct;
only I wish to advocate more of them, any number of them, like barbed
wire along ridges and eaves. If you want to neutralize a thunder-bolt,
three points are not as effective as 3000." This was written in 1892;
nearly 140 years before that date, we find a simple parish priest of an
obscure village in Moravia using precisely such a multiple system of
short, pointed conductors for the protection of life and property. This
lightning conductor or meteorological machine, as Divisch called it,
was erected by him at Prenditz on June 15th, 1754. On the top of the rod
will be seen three light vanes, which were added in the interest of the
feathered race in order to prevent incautious members from incurring the
risk of electrocution by alighting on the apparatus during a storm. The
wind whirled the vanes round like the cups of an anemometer, and thus
kept the birds away from the zone of danger.

Set of Pointed Rods


Several trials came to the electrical Pastor, and from
quarters least expected. It happened in the second
year after the erection of the apparatus that the summer
was unusually dry, in consequence of which the
crops failed almost completely. The farmers of the
neighborhood were always suspicious of the strange-looking
mast of Prenditz; and, be it said, that they were
more than diffident about the propriety of interfering
with the forces of nature even under the plea of protection,
forgetting that they took great care to protect
themselves against heat and cold, rain, snow and hail.
The country ladies, no doubt, used parasols for one kind
of protection; and the gentry, umbrellas for another.
Anyhow, the people of Prenditz and the good folk
around did not like the lofty mast, with its outstretched
arms and bristling rows of suspicious-looking iron points
connected to the ground by means of four long, heavy
chains. For the nonce, they deemed their Pastor a
queer fellow, who thought that he could avert the anger
of heaven by the oddest kind of a machine which they
ever laid their eyes on. It was argued in the councils
of the hamlets that, whatever advantages Divisch
claimed for his "machine," they were all of a negative
character. It prevented the lightning stroke, he said;
that might be, but they did not see the prevention.
What they did see and keenly realize was the failure of
their crops. That affected them very closely; and if, as
they supposed, the apparatus of Prenditz had anything
to do with it, the sooner they got rid of the machine the
better. Divisch, it must be said, was liked by his
people; but despite his popularity, the men of violence
carried the day and the machine was doomed. Popular
passion, excited by personal interest, got the better of
the consideration due to the Pastor. On an appointed
day, a band of bellicose farmers came down on the
village and wrecked the apparatus which had cost the
priest so much thought and manual labor and on which,
knowingly and justly, he relied for the protection of the
homesteads of his rustic flock.

This recalls a similar incident of mob violence which
occurred at St. Omer in the north of France, where a
manufacturer of that quaint old town, who had been in
America and seen the usefulness of lightning conductors,
proceeded to erect one over his own house. Hardly was
it completed before the populace gathered together; and,
when passion was sufficiently aroused by inflammatory
remarks of the demagogues, the house was attacked
and the conductor torn down. The manufacturer complained
of the inaction of the "gardiens de la paix"
and appealed to the courts to uphold his right to protect
his home against lightning. He entrusted his case to a
young, brilliant lawyer, as yet unknown to fame, but
one destined to achieve unenviable notoriety during the
revolutionary period. This, the first defender of the
lightning-rod in a court of justice, was Robespierre.

The news of the untoward event soon reached the
ears of the Premonstratensian's superiors at Kloster-Bruck;
and, as they very wisely considered that the
duty of a country priest is primarily to attend to the
spiritual welfare of his people, rather than to invent
machines for their protection against the bolts of heaven,
they advised him to yield to the prejudice of his people
and not reconstruct the objectionable apparatus.

Father Divisch accepted the friendly advice of his superiors
and obeyed like a good Premonstratensian monk.
The remains of the shattered "meteorological machine"
were sent to the abbey at Bruck, where they could be
seen for many years afterward. As a consequence of
this act of vandalism, Divisch gave up experimenting
with lightning-rods and with electricity itself. The
villagers were satisfied, but the world at large lost the
benefit that might accrue from the researches on atmospheric
electricity which Divisch would have carried on
during the remaining nineteen years of his life.

In giving up electricity, the disappointed priest turned
his attention, first, to acoustics and then, practical man
as he was, to the construction of musical instruments.
It was not long before his genius brought out an
orchestrion of wind and stringed instruments which was
played like an organ with hands and feet, and which
was capable of 130 different combinations. Prince
Henry of Prussia offered a considerable sum of money
for the invention, but Divisch died while the preliminaries
of sale were arranging, and negotiations were
broken off. The instrument remained for many years
in the abbey at Bruck, where it was in daily use for the
canonical office.

It is a curious coincidence that Franklin was also
interested in musical instruments. He is credited with
having devised an improved form of glass harmonica,
one of which he presented to Queen Marie Antoinette.

Despite the bitter experience of Divisch, the introduction
of lightning conductors into Italy was warmly
advocated some years later by Padre Toaldo (1719-1797),
an admirer and correspondent of Franklin. It was
through his influence and personal activity that the
magnificent thirteenth-century Cathedral of Siena was
protected with lightning conductors after having been
repeatedly struck during the centuries and seriously
damaged. Toaldo published in 1774 his celebrated work
on the protection of public edifices and private buildings
against lightning; it contributed greatly to reassure
public opinion on the value of "Franklinian rods," as
the conductors were commonly called.

It is a matter of regret that Franklin used the words
"the electric fluid is attracted by the points" in the
passage quoted above, inasmuch as in the popular mind
such "attraction" courts rather than averts danger.
As already said, the rod no more "attracts" lightning
than a rain-pipe attracts a downpour. Franklin
knew very well the twofold function of his rods, the
preventive, by which they tend to ward off the stroke
by gradually and silently neutralizing the excessive
energy of the cloud; and the other, the preservative, by
which they convey the discharge safely to earth when
struck. He even complains of people who concentrate
their attention on the preventive function, forgetting
the other entirely, adding that, "Wherever my opinion
is examined in Europe, nothing is considered but the
probability of these rods preventing a stroke, which is
only a part of the use which I proposed for them; and
the other part, their conducting a stroke which they
may happen not to prevent, seems to be totally forgotten,
though of equal importance and advantage."
(1755.)

At a time, it was customary to make the rods rise to
a considerable height above the building, in the belief
that the diameter of the circle of protection was four
times the height of the rod. Such a rule was an arbitrary
one which facts soon showed to be unreliable and
unsafe. It is now recognized that there is no such thing
as a definite area of protection.

Were this a literary chapter, we would point out that
either of the expressions "electric" storm or "lightning"
storm is preferable to thunder-storm, because
electricity or lightning is the active agent or principal
feature of the impressive phenomenon. No one thinks
of calling a hailstorm by the descriptive term of patter-storm;
yet that would be just as logical and appropriate
an appellative in one case as thunder-storm is in the
other.

Thunder-tube is certainly a startling misnomer applied
to the long, narrow, glazed tubes formed in siliceous
materials by the fervid heat of the flash, but not in any
way by the sound-waves produced by the crash. Thunder-bolt
does not mean, despite the common opinion, a
white-hot mass that accompanies the discharge; it is
purely and simply the flash itself. A glowing mass that
happens to come down in the track of the discharge is a
meteorite, a body of cosmic not terrestrial origin, a visitor
from space that chose the rarefied path of the flash for
its descent to earth.

Again, there are no thunder-clouds in nature, only
electric clouds or lightning clouds; nor is there ever
thunder in the air save when the lightning breaks from
cloud to cloud, or leaps from cloud to earth, or strikes
from earth to cloud. But though thunder is only occasionally
in the air, electricity always is. We have a
normal electrical field in all seasons, times and places.

Though it is the lightning that kills and not the thunder,
we would not, however, object to the following inscription
which we found on a tombstone:


"Here lies (so and so), oh! what a wonder,
She was killed outright by a peal of thunder,"


because the suddenness of the peal may have given the
aged lady a shock from which her failing heart was
unable to recover.

We are well aware that such criticism of technical
terms in popular use will have no reform effect whatever;
because as long as people will say "the sun rises"
and "the stars set," they will continue to speak of
thunder-clouds and thunder-storms, thunder-tubes and
thunder-bolts. Though containing an element of error,
these expressions have the sanction of the centuries;
and so, they have come to stay.

Returning to Divisch, that worthy priest and pioneer
electrician died at Prenditz in his sixty-ninth year, on
Dec. 21st, 1765, and was buried in the little churchyard
where he had blessed many a grave during the twenty-five
years of his ministration. A simple inscription marks
the place of his interment, but a monument will soon be
erected to his memory which will tell the passerby where
sleeps the Premonstratensian pioneer of the lightning-rod.

About three months before the erection of his rod,
i.e., in June, 1752, the idea occurred to Franklin that
he could approach the region of clouds just as well by
means of a common kite. Here are his words anent
the novel and famous experiment with the "lightning
kite":



"Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the
arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large
thin silk handkerchief when extended; tie the corners
of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross,
so you have the body of a kite, which, being properly
accommodated with a tail, loop and string, will rise in
the air, like those made of paper; but this, being of
silk, is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder-gust
without tearing. To the top of the upright stick is to
be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or two
above the wood. In the end of the twine, next the
hand, is to be held a silk ribbon, and where the silk and
cord join a key may be fastened. This kite is to be
raised when a thunder-gust appears to be coming on,
and the person who holds the string must stand within
a door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk
ribbon may not be wet; and care must be taken that
the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window.
As soon as any of the thunder-clouds come over
the kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire
from them, and the kite with all the twine will be electrified,
and the loose filaments of the twine will stand
out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger.
And when the rain has wetted the kite, so that
it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it
stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of
your knuckle. At this key the phial may be charged,
and from electric fire thus obtained spirits may be kindled
and all the other electric experiments be performed
which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass
globe or tube, and thereby the sameness of the electric
matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated."[10]

Here we have the electric kite and manner of using it
fully described without, however, any direct statement
that the author himself actually experimented with it,
although he does say that the experiment was successfully
carried out. This is strictly true, but it may be
safely contended that the precautions enumerated, the
observation about the fibres of the cord, its improved
conductivity when wetted by the rain and the like, all
bespeak a knowledge of practical conditions that could
be obtained only by way of experiment.

But if Franklin is not outspoken on the matter, some
of his contemporaries are. Here is the kite incident as
related in the Continuation of the Life of Dr. Franklin,
by Dr. Stuber, a Philadelphian and intimate friend of
the Franklins:



"While Franklin was waiting for the erection of a
spire, it occurred to him that he might have more ready
access to the region of clouds by means of a common
kite. He prepared one by fastening two cross-sticks
to a silk handkerchief, which would not suffer so much
from the rain as paper. To the upright stick was affixed
an iron point. The string was, as usual, of hemp,
except the lower end, which was silk. Where the
hempen string terminated, a key was fastened. With
this apparatus, on the appearance of a thunder-gust
approaching, he went out into the commons, accompanied
by his son, to whom alone he communicated his
intentions, well knowing the ridicule which, too generally
for the interest of science, awaits unsuccessful experiments
in philosophy. He placed himself under a
shed to avoid the rain. His kite was raised. A thunder-cloud
passed over it. No sign of electricity appeared.
He almost despaired of success, when suddenly he observed
the loose fibres of his string move toward an
erect position. He now presented his knuckle to the
key and received a strong spark. Repeated sparks were
drawn from the key, the phial was charged, a shock
given, and all the experiments made which are usually
performed with electricity."

This testimony of a man who enjoyed the unlimited
confidence of Franklin has a very matter-of-fact ring
about it; there is not a note of uncertainty, not a word
indicating doubt that his friend and neighbor went out
to the fields accompanied by his robust son, carrying
along with them a queer assortment of electrical impedimenta.
This son, William by name, was twenty-two
years of age at the time; and as he died in 1813, eleven
years after the publication of Dr. Stuber's biographical
sketch, he had ample time to contradict the kite story
if instead of being a fact it were a mere romance. Nor
is this all, for Dr. Stuber's narrative, given above,
appears textually in the "Memoirs of the Life and
Writings of Benjamin Franklin," edited by his grandson
William Temple Franklin. The Doctor, be it remarked,
was very fond of his grandson, whose "faithful service
and filial attachment" he warmly commends in several
of his letters, and whose regard for the memory of the
statesman led him to undertake the task of preparing
his works for publication. On page 211, Vol. I., he tells
us that "As Dr. Franklin mentioned his electrical discoveries
only in a very transient way, and as they are
of a most important and interesting nature, it has been
thought that a short disgression on the subject would
be excusable and not void of entertainment. For this
purpose the following account of the same, including
the first experiment of the lightning kite, as given by
Dr. Stuber, is here given."

In these concluding lines we have the testimony of
Franklin's grandson to the authenticity of the "lightning
kite" story. Moreover, the account as given by
Stuber evidently meets with his cordial approval, since
he transcribes it verbatim; and, as if to invest the quotations
with unimpeachable authority, he tells us in the
preface, p. viii., that "they deserve entire dependence
because of the accuracy of the information imparted."

A word now from Priestley, also one of Franklin's
intimate friends. In his History of Electricity, fourth
edition, p. 171, he says that "Dr. Franklin, astonishing
as it must have appeared, continued actually to bring
lightning from the heavens by means of an electrical
kite which he raised when a storm of thunder was perceived
to be coming on." Then follows a description
taken almost word for word from Dr. Stuber, whom he
styles "the best authority on the subject."

If, perchance, the above testimony should not be
deemed conclusive and final, all lingering doubt must be
removed by Franklin's own words, for in his Autobiography,
after briefly referring to the experiments
made in France with pointed conductors, he adds: "I
will not swell this narrative with an account of that
capital experiment (the pointed conductor), nor of the
infinite pleasure which I received on the success of a
similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia,
as both are to be found in histories of electricity."

Here, at last, we have Franklin's own word for it,
that he made the kite experiment, and that he made it
"soon after" the demonstration of his electrical discoveries
which M. de Lor gave, by request, before
Louis XV. and his court.

The "lightning kite" is, therefore, not a myth, as
some have ventured to think, having been fully described
by Franklin in his letter to Peter Collinson,
dated October 19th, 1752, and having been made by him
some time in June of the same year.

We have now to see whether Franklin was anticipated
in the idea of the kite or in its use for electrical
purposes. There are some who hold that he was
anticipated by M. de Romas as to the idea, but not
the actual experiment; while others credit the French
magistrate with both. Let us examine the evidence
which there is for these opinions.

M. de Romas lived in Nérac, a small town some
seventy-five miles south of Bordeaux. He was a member
of the bar; and at the time of the Franklinian furor
in Europe was a judge of the district court. He took
an interest in scientific matters quite unusual for men
of his profession, proceeding, as soon as he had read of
the efficiency of pointed conductors, to study their behavior
for himself. His experiments met with surprising
success, and were as much admired by the local
savants as they were dreaded by the common folk.
Letters containing his observations were regularly sent to
the Academy of Bordeaux, where they were read with
lively interest on account of their character and novelty.
From the published Actes of that body we learn that
the first kite used by de Romas was raised by him on
May 14th, 1753. Disappointment, however, attended
this attempt, no electrical manifestation being observed,
although rain fell and wetted the hempen cord. The
magistrate of Nérac attributed his failure to the resistance
of the string; and, like a good electrician, surprisingly
good for the time, determined to improve its
conductivity by wrapping a fine copper wire round its
entire length. When this long and tedious operation
was completed, he went out again to the fields on a
stormy day, when, assisted by two of his friends, he
raised the kite and soon got torrents of sparks from the
wire-wound cord. This was on June 7th, 1753. The
experiment was repeated from time to time, both for
his own satisfaction and that of his assistants as well
as for the entertainment of his ever-growing class of
admiring spectators. Kites 7-1/2 ft. long and 3 ft. wide
were raised 400 and even 550 ft. above ground when
flashes nine feet long and an inch thick were drawn, so
the account says, with the report of a pistol. The effect
must have been truly spectacular. The kite was held
by a silk ribbon fastened to the end of the hempen cord.

It is then a matter of history vouched for by the
Actes of the Academy of Bordeaux that May 14th, 1753,
is the day on which the first use of a kite for electrical
purposes was made in France; on the other hand, it is
to be remembered that Franklin flew his "lightning
kite" in June, 1752, almost a year earlier. As far,
then, as the fact is concerned, the Philadelphia philosopher
was not anticipated by the Justice of Nérac.

From facts let us pass to writings. Franklin's letter
to Collinson, in which he describes the electric kite, is
dated October 19th, 1752, while that of M. de Romas, on
which the claim for priority is founded, was addressed
by him to the Academy of Bordeaux on July 12th, 1752,
three months earlier. After a lengthy and interesting
account of his experiments with pointed conductors, he
concludes his communication as follows:

"C'est là, Monsieur, ce qu'il y a de plus important,
car j'aurais bien d'autres particularités à vous communiquer;
mais ma lettre, devenue d'une excessive longueur,
m'avertit de finir. Je me réserve de mettre au jour la
dernière (quoiquelle ne soit qu'un jeu d'enfant) lorsque
je me serai assuré de la réussite par l'expérience que je
me propose d'en faire et que je ne negligerai pas."

In English this would read: "Such, Sir, are the more
important points which I have to communicate, and to
which many others might be added, were it not for the
excessive length of this letter, which warns me that it
is time to bring it to a close. I will, however, give
publicity to the last one of all (though it is only a child's
plaything) as soon as I shall have assured myself of its
success by an experiment which I have devised and
which I shall not fail to make."

The words in brackets       "though it is only a child's
plaything"       are all important, for it is on them and on
them alone that the claim for priority has been put forth
and maintained. It will be seen that the word kite (cerf-volant),
does not occur in the letter, so that there can
be no absolute certainty as to the nature of the jeu d'enfant
which the author had in mind, though it is very
likely that the kite was meant. In his Mémoire sur les
moyens de se garantir de la foudre dans les maisons, he
says, after describing some experiments that he had
made with pointed rods: "Néanmoins toujours plein du
désir d'augmenter le volume du feu électricque, il fallut
chercher le moyen pour y parvenir. En conséquence, je
me plongeai dans de nouvelles méditations. Enfin une
demi-heure après, tout au plus, le cerf-volant des enfants
se présenta tout à coup à mon esprit, et il me tardait de
la mettre à l'épreuve. Par malheur, je n'en avais pas
le temps." In English: "Being anxious to augment
the quantity of electric fire, I began to think of some
means to effect my purpose, and soon became quite absorbed
with the subject. Not more than half an hour
elapsed before the idea of the kite suddenly occurred to
me, and I longed for an opportunity to try it; but unfortunately
I had not sufficient leisure at the time." The
work in which this passage occurs was published at Bordeaux
in 1776, shortly after the death of the author. De
Romas always maintained that he did not borrow the idea
of the kite from any one, but that it occurred to him while
pursuing his experiments with pointed conductors.

It must be admitted that de Romas could not have
been acquainted with Franklin's performance of June,
1752, when he sent to the Bordeaux Academy his letter
of July 12th, of the same year, for we cannot suppose
that in an age of sailing vessels such news would cross
the Atlantic and reach an obscure provincial town in the
southwest of France in the space of a month. On the
other hand, it is equally improbable that a vague allusion
to the electrical use of a kite made at Nérac on July
12th, by a man entirely unknown to fame as was de
Romas, should be talked of on the banks of the Schuylkill
before October 19th, the date of Franklin's memorable
letter to Collinson. Moreover, the "jeu d'enfant"
allusion as well as the very use of the kite by de Romas
failed so completely to attract the attention of scientific
men of his own country that he frequently and bitterly
complained down to the end of his life, in 1776, of their
persistent neglect of his claims to recognition.

From all this, we conclude:

(a) That Franklin's "lightning kite" is not a myth,
the experiment having been made by him in June, 1752,
and fully described by him in a memorable letter written
to Peter Collinson, of London, dated October 19th of the
same year:

(b) That de Romas independently had the idea of
using a kite for electrical purposes as early as July 12th,
1752; but that he did not carry out his idea until May
14th, 1753; and, furthermore, that he did not succeed in
getting any electrical manifestations until June 7th,
1753, his success then being due, at least in part, to the
clever idea which he had of entwining the cord with a
fine copper wire. Therefore, suum cuique.

In conclusion, we would say that the cardinal and
enduring achievements of Franklin are:

(1) His rejection of the two-fluid theory of electricity
and substitution of the one-fluid theory; (2) his coinage
of the appropriate terms positive and negative, to denote
an excess or a deficit of the common electric fluid; (3)
his explanation of the Leyden jar, and, notably, his
recognition of the paramount role played by the glass or
dielectric; (4) his experimental demonstration of the
identity of lightning and electricity; and (5) his invention
of the lightning conductor for the protection of life
and property, together with his clear statement of its
preventive and protective functions.

If Franklin was well acquainted with electrical phenomena,
it is safe to say that his knowledge of human
nature was wider and deeper still. This appears continually
in his Autobiography, in his political writings,
in business transactions and diplomatic relations.

On one occasion, while his re-election as clerk of the
General Assembly was pending, a certain member made
a long speech against him. Franklin listened with
calm, dignified composure; and after his election, instead
of resenting the opposition of the offending member, he
determined that it would be better to disarm his antagonism
and win his friendship. For this purpose he
sent the assemblyman a courteously-worded request for
the loan of a very scarce book which was in his library.
The book was sent to Franklin, who returned it within
a week with a note of thanks, which had the desired
effect. Commenting on the event, our philosopher says
that "it is more profitable to remove than to resent
inimical proceedings."

Some of Franklin's views on general political economy
are tersely set forth in the following passage: "There
seem, in fine, to be but three ways for a nation to acquire
wealth. The first is by war, as the Romans did in
plundering their conquered neighbor; this is robbery.
The second is by commerce, which is generally cheating.
The third is by agriculture, the only honest way wherein
man receives a real increase of the seed thrown into the
ground, in a kind of continual miracle wrought by the
hand of God in his favour, as a reward for his innocent
life and virtuous industry."

Franklin asserts his religious convictions in many
passages of his "Autobiography" as well as on many
occasions of his public life. Shocked by "Tom" Paine's
views of fundamental religious truths, he says: "I
have read your manuscript with some attention. By
the argument which it contains against a particular
Providence, though you allow a general Providence,
you strike at the foundation of all religion.
For, without the belief of a Providence that takes
cognizance of, guards and guides, and may favour particular
persons, there is no motive to worship a Deity,
to fear His displeasure, or to pray for His protection.
I will not enter into any discussion of your principles,
though you seem to desire it. At present, I shall only
give you my opinion that, though your reasonings are
very subtile and may prevail with some readers, you
will not succeed so as to change the general sentiments
of mankind on that subject; and the consequence of
printing this piece will be a great deal of odium drawn
upon yourself, mischief to you, and no benefit to others.
He that spits against the wind, spits in his own face."

This aphorism recalls the ripe wisdom contained in
many of the sayings of "Poor Richard," for Franklin
was a deep thinker, shrewd observer and quaint expositor
of his own philosophy. Continuing, he fleeces
Paine in the following noble words: "But were you to
succeed, do you imagine any good would be done by it?
You yourself may find it easy to live a virtuous life
without the assistance afforded by religion; you having
a clear perception of the advantages of virtue and the
disadvantages of vice, and possessing strength of resolution
sufficient to enable you to resist common temptations.
But think how great a portion of mankind
consists of weak and ignorant men and women, and of
inexperienced, inconsiderate youth of both sexes, who
have need of the motives of religion to restrain them
from vice, to support them to virtue, and retain them
in the practice of it till it becomes habitual, which is
the great point for its security. And perhaps you are
indebted to her originally, that is, to your religious education
for the habits of virtue upon which you now justly
value yourself. You might easily display your excellent
talents of reasoning upon a less hazardous subject, and
thereby obtain a rank with our most distinguished
authors. For among us, it is not necessary, as among
the Hottentots, that a youth, to be raised into the company
of men, should prove his manhood by beating his
mother."

Franklin concludes this magnificent expression of his
religious faith by the solemn warning: "I would advise
you, therefore, not to attempt unchaining the tiger, but
to burn this piece before it is seen by any other person;
whereby you will save yourself a great deal of mortification
by the enemies it may raise against you, and perhaps
a good deal of regret and repentance. If men are
so wicked with religion, what would they be without it?"

Franklin's belief in the cardinal doctrine of the resurrection
of the body is well expressed in the epitaph
which he wrote for himself in 1728, when in his twenty-second
year. It reads


The Body
Of
Benjamin Franklin
Printer,
(Like the cover of an old book
Its contents torn out
And stript of its lettering and gilding)
Lies here, food for worms.
But the work shall not be lost
For it will (as he believed) appear once more
In a new and more elegant edition
Revised and corrected
By
The Author.


However, when the statesman and philosopher was
laid at rest beside his wife in the Cemetery of Christ
Church, Philadelphia, in 1790, the marble slab which
marked the grave bore no other inscription than Franklin's
name and the date of his death.

Appreciating the great loss which the country sustained
by the death of Franklin, Congress ordered a
general mourning for one month throughout the fourteen
States of the Union; and the French National Assembly
decreed three days of public mourning at the
instance of Mirabeau, who said in his address that "The
genius that gave freedom to America and scattered torrents
of light upon Europe, has returned to the bosom
of the Divinity. Antiquity would have erected altars
to that mortal who for the advantage of the human
race, embracing both heaven and earth in his vast mind,
knew how to subdue both thunder and tyranny."

The fugitive apprentice boy of 1723 turned out to be
one of the most esteemed and eminent Americans of his
day. Of an even temper and well-balanced mind, he was
plain in dress, simple in manner, easy of approach and
friendly to all. The success which he achieved during
his long career of eighty-five years, shows what may be
done by seizing the opportunities which come to every
one, by concentration of mind, application to duty and
tenacity of purpose. He attained distinction in science,
in letters, in diplomacy; he stood for good government
and true liberty. His name is a household one in his
own country, where monuments, institutions and cities
will bear it down to posterity.

CHAPTER IV.
Galvani, Discoverer of Animal Electricity.



Aloisio Galvani


It is a well-known fact, often commented on in the
history of medicine, that Harvey, the discoverer of the
circulation of the blood, did not give the details of his
discovery to the public for some twenty years after he
had first reached it. The reason for his delay was twofold.
With the characteristic patience of a real investigator
in science, Harvey wanted to work out the
details of his discovery for himself before giving it to
the public, and wished to be sure of all he would have
to say about it before committing it to print. He had
not, as had indeed none of the really great discoverers
in science, that intense desire for publicity which causes
smaller men to rush into print with their embryonic
discoveries, or oftener, their supposed discoveries, the
moment they get their first distant glimpse of a new
truth or see some mirage of a distant scientific principle,
perhaps already well known, in their heated imaginations.
Small men squabble about priority in small discoveries,
and rush headlong into print, lest some one
should anticipate their wonderful observation. The
example of Harvey can scarcely be commended too
highly, for if followed, it would save the world of
science a lot of bother and obviate the necessity of taking
back many things that have been proclaimed in the
name of science. Fortunately, it has been the rule
among genuine students of science, not because of any
deliberate imitation of their great predecessors, but
because of modest assurance of the worth of their work
and honest desire to perfect it before giving it to the
world.

Luigi, or, as he preferred to be known himself,
Aloysio Galvani, for the young prince of the house of
Gonzaga whose canonization made him St. Aloysius was
his patron in baptism and a favorite in life, presents an
interesting exemplification of this characteristic trait of
the really great discoverer in science, to wait calmly and
work faithfully for thorough confirmation of his views
before publishing them. His admirable patience in
reaching the real significance of his discovery before
proclaiming the results of his investigations is only a
typical illustration of the modest thorough scientist that
he was. It used to be said that Galvani's discovery of
the twitchings of the frog's legs, which led him to give
himself to serious investigations into animal electricity,
was made more or less by accident in 1786. His views
on the subject of animal electricity were not formally
published until the appearance of his treatise, De Viribus
Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius, in the
eighth volume of the Memoirs of the Institute of Science
of Bologna, published in 1791. This would seem to
indicate that only five years elapsed between his original
observation and the publication of his views. Even
this interval may seem long enough to our modern
notions of at least supposed rapidity of scientific progress,
but we know now, from documents in the
possession of the Institute of Science at Bologna, that,
twenty years previous to the publication of this
commentary, Galvani was deeply interested in the
action of electricity upon the muscles of frogs, and was
diligently and fruitfully occupied during his spare time
with investigations upon this subject.

When, in Makers of Modern Medicine,[11] I called special
attention to the fact that practically all of the greatest
discoverers in medicine had made their cardinal
discovery, or at least the far-reaching observation that
opened up for them the special career in investigation
that was to make them famous, before they were
thirty-five, one of my critics doubted the assertion and
suggested the case of Galvani as a distinct exception.
Ordinarily, it is presumed that his discovery of the
twitchings of frogs' legs under the influence of electricity
was made in 1786, when he was in his forty-ninth
year. As a matter of fact, however, his first observations
were made and his attention attracted to the importance
of the subject when he was scarcely more than
thirty. His career is indeed a striking example of the
earliness in life at which a great man's work is likely
to come to him, and yet illustrates very aptly the patience
with which he devotes himself to it, without
seeking the idle reputation to be derived from immediate
announcement, if he really has the true spirit of
the scientific investigator.

Galvani began original work of a high order very
early in his medical career. His graduation thesis on
the human skeleton treated especially of the formation
and development of bone, and attracted no little attention.
It is noteworthy because of the breadth of view
in it, for it touches on the various questions relative
to osteology, from the standpoint of physics and
chemistry, as well as medicine and surgery. It was
sufficient to obtain for its author the place of lecturer
in anatomy in the University of Bologna, besides the
post of director of the teaching of anatomy in the Institute
of Sciences, a subsidiary institution. Here, from
the very beginning, Galvani's course was popular. He
was not, as we note elsewhere, a fluent talker, but he
was one of the first who introduced experimental
demonstrations of his subject into his lectures, and this
made his teaching very attractive and drew crowds to
his university courses.

Galvani's work as an anatomist, however, was done
much more in comparative anatomy than in the study
of the human being. He selected birds for the special
subject of his first investigations in the field, and his
monograph on the kidneys of birds attracted widespread
attention among the scientists of Europe. As
the farthest removed from man of the beings that are
warm-blooded, these creatures have always attracted
particular attention, and, quite apart from any interest
in evolution, were the subject of special investigation.
Owing to the facility with which they can be studied in
embryonic stages in the hatching egg, most of the
peculiarities of their structure and development are
very well known now. The kidneys of the bird are
especially interesting, because they represent a different
phase of development from that of human beings. Galvani
had selected, then, one of the cardinal or turning-point
subjects in comparative anatomy. As he pointed
out very clearly, the kidneys of birds differ very much
among themselves, and the intense muscular action of
this creature makes a large amount of excretory material,
that must be disposed of, and consequently demands
much more active kidney function than occurs in most
other classes of animals. Galvani studied every feature       the
vessels, the nerves, the canals       and almost necessarily
pointed out many new points or added hitherto
unknown details.

He next devoted himself to the study of the ear of
the bird. This might seem to be of little special interest,
since hearing is not one of the most characteristic
qualities of the winged species. It so happens, however,
that the semi-circular canals which are closely
connected with the auditory apparatus in all animals
are extremely large in birds. As a consequence of this,
the avian auditory structures assume an importance in
comparative anatomy quite like that of the kidneys in
the same species. After Galvani had completed his
studies, he found that he had been anticipated by another
great Italian anatomist of the time, Antonio
Scarpa (of Scarpa's triangle in human anatomy), who
afterwards became the Chief Surgeon to Napoleon.
Galvani abandoned the idea of publishing his book then,
but published a short article, in which he added much
to Scarpa's details and conclusions. His additions were
particularly with regard to the semi-circular canals,
which are probably the organ of direction, the necessity
for which, in this species, for the purpose of flying, is
so easy to understand. He also described with great
care the single ossicle or small bone, which replaces the
chain of little bones that exist in mammal ears, and
pointed out that the shape of this bone and its appendages
enabled it to fulfil, though single, all the functions
of the hammer, the anvil and the stirrup bones in
human beings.

Galvani's careful study of the semi-circular canals of
various species of birds can perhaps be better appreciated
from the fact that he made it a point to measure
their size exactly, as compared to the semi-circular
canals of most other creatures. He found that the
semi-circular canals of the hawk, for instance, were
larger than the corresponding structures in man or even
in the cow or the horse. As these latter animals are
many hundred times larger than the largest birds, the
special significance of the canals in birds becomes manifest.
In certain of the birds, as he pointed out, these
structures are not semi-circles, nor indeed of circular
form at all, but take on much more the shape of an
ellipse, and, indeed, sometimes the arc of curvature of
the ellipse is quite acute. He seems to have had no
hint, however, of the function that we have in modern
times assigned to these structures, that of presiding
over direction and equilibrium, and discusses in his
rather vigorous Latin what the physiological significance
of them may be as regards hearing. He thinks that
they add something to the acuity of hearing, and would
seem to imply that in birds flying rapidly through the
air, there was the necessity for a more perfect hearing
apparatus than among other creatures, and that this
was the reason for the huge development of their semi-circular
canals.

At this time the science of comparative anatomy was
just beginning to attract widespread attention. John
Hunter, in London, was doing a great work in this line,
which placed him in the front rank of contributors to
biology and collectors of important facts in all the sciences
allied to anatomy and physiology. Galvani's
work on birds, then, made him a pioneer in the biological
sciences that were to attract so much attention
during the nineteenth century. His experimental work
in comparative anatomy, strange as it might seem,
and apparently not to be expected, led him into the domain
of electricity, through the observation of certain
phenomena of animal electricity and the effects of electrical
currents on animals.

Like so many other great discoveries in science,
Galvani's first attraction to his subject of animal electricity
is often said to have been the result of a happy
accident. Of course it is easy to talk of accidents in
these cases. Archimedes and his bath; the fall of the
apple for Newton; Laennec's observation of the boys
tapping on a log in the courtyard of the Louvre and
the ready conduction of sound, from which he got his
idea for the invention of the stethoscope; Lord Kelvin's
eye-glass falling and showing him how a weightless
arm for his electrometer might be obtained in a beam of
light,       may all be called happy accidents if you will.
Without the inventive scientific genius ready to take
advantage of them, however, these accidents would not
have been raised to the higher plane of important incidents
in the history of science. These phenomena
had probably occurred under men's eyes hundreds of
times before, but there was no great mind ready to
receive the seeds of thought suggested, nor to follow
out the conclusions so obviously indicated. Galvani's
observation of the twitching of the muscles of the frog
under the influence of electricity, may be called one of
the happy accidents of scientific development, but it
was Galvani's own genius that made the accident happy.

There are two stories told as to the method of the
first observation in this matter. Both of them make
his wife an important factor in the discovery. According
to a popular but less authentic form of the history,
Galvani was engaged in preparing some frogs' legs as
a special dainty for his wife, who was ill and liked this
delicacy very much. He thought so much of her that
he was doing this himself, in the hope that she would
be thus more readily tempted to eat them. While so engaged,
he exposed the large nerve of the animal's
hind legs, and at the same time split the skin covering
the muscles. In doing this he touched the nerve muscle
preparation, as this has come to be called, with the scalpel
and the forceps simultaneously, with the result that
twitchings occurred. While seeking the cause of these
twitchings, the idea of animal electricity came to him.

The other form of the story is told a little later in
Galvani's own words in the analysis of his monograph
on animal electricity. He does not mention his wife in
it, but there is a tradition that she was present in the
laboratory when the phenomenon of the twitching of the
frog's legs was first noticed, and indeed that it was she who
called his attention to the curious occurrence.

She was a woman of well-developed intellect, and her association
with her father and also with her husband made her
well acquainted with the anatomy and physiology
of the day. She realized that what had occurred was quite
out of the ordinary. She is even said to have
suggested their possible connection with the presence and
action of the electric apparatus. Husband and
wife, then, together, by means of a series of observations
determined that, whenever the apparatus was not
in use the phenomenon of the convulsive movements of
the frog's legs did not take place, notwithstanding irritation
by the scalpel. Whenever the electric apparatus
was working, however, then the phenomenon in question
always took place. According to either form of
the story, if we accept the traditions in the matter, Madame
Galvani had an important part in the discovery.

Galvani's most important contribution to science is
undoubtedly his De Viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari
Commentarius       Commentary on the Forces of
Electricity in Their Relation to Muscular Motion. Like
many another epoch-making contribution to science, it
is not a large work, but in his collected works in the edition
of 1841, occupies altogether sixty-four pages, of scarcely
more than two hundred and fifty words to the page.
There are probably not more than fifteen thousand
words in it altogether. It was published originally in
the eighth volume of the Memoirs of the Institute of
Science at Bologna, in 1791, but a reprint of it, with
some modifications, was issued at Modena in the following
year. This Modenese edition, published by the
Societa Typographica, was annotated by Professor
Giovanni Aldini, who also wrote an accompanying dissertation,
De Animalis Electricae Theoriae Ortu Atque
Incrementis, On the Rise and Development of the
Theory of Animal Electricity. In this volume was also
published a letter from Galvani to Professor Carminati,
in Italian, on the Seat of Animal Electricity. These
two editions are the sources to which we must turn for
whatever Galvani tried to make known with regard to
animal electricity.

This little volume consists of four parts: the first of
which is devoted to a consideration of the effects of artificial
electricity on muscular motion; the second is on
the effect of atmospheric electricity on muscular motion;
the third is on the effect of animal electricity on muscular
motion; and the fourth consists of a series of
conjectures and some conclusions from his observations.
The arrangement of the work, as can readily be understood
from this, is thoroughly scientific. Galvani proceeds
from what was best known and most evident to
what he knew less about, trying to enlarge the bounds
of knowledge and then suggesting the conclusions that
might be drawn from his work and offering a number of
hints as to the possible significance of many of the
phenomena that might form suggestive material for
further experimentation along this same line. In spite
of the forbiddingness of the Latin to a modern scientist,
as a rule, the little work is well worthy of study because
of its eminently scientific method and the excellent
evidence it affords of the way serious students of science
approached a scientific thesis before the beginning
of the nineteenth century.

The first paragraph of this dissertation is of such
fundamental significance, because it represents the primal
work done in animal electricity, that it has seemed
to me worth while presenting entire. The original
Latin from which the translation is made, and from
which a good idea of Galvani's Latin style may be obtained,
is given in a note.[12]

"I had dissected a frog and had prepared it, as in
Figure 2 of the fifth plate (in which is shown a nerve
muscle preparation), and had placed it upon a table on
which there was an electric machine, while I set about
doing certain other things. The frog was entirely
separated from the conductor of the machine, and
indeed was at no small distance away from it. While
one of those who were assisting me touched lightly and
by chance the point of his scalpel to the internal crural
nerves of the frog, suddenly all the muscles of its limbs
were seen to be so contracted that they seemed to have
fallen into tonic convulsions. Another of my assistants,
who was making ready to take up certain experiments
in electricity with me, seemed to notice that this happened
only at the moment when a spark came from the
conductor of the machine. He was struck with the
novelty of the phenomenon, and immediately spoke to me
about it, for I was at the moment occupied with
other things and mentally preoccupied. I was at once
tempted to repeat the experiment, so as to make clear
whatever might be obscure in it. For this purpose I
took up the scalpel and moved its point close to one or
the other of the crural nerves of the frog, while at the
same time one of my assistants elicited sparks from the
electric machine. The phenomenon happened exactly
as before. Strong contractions took place in every
muscle of the limb, and at the very moment when the
sparks appeared, the animal was seized as it were with
tetanus."

Galvani then explains in detail how he made observations
on control frogs at moments when there were no
electric sparks, and decided that the contact with the
scalpel was only effective in producing twitchings when
there was a simultaneous electric spark. He noted,
also, that occasionally the contractions did not occur, in
spite of the fulfilment of the conditions mentioned. He
traced this to fatigue. He then proceeded to vary the
experiment in many ways, decreasing the size of the
scalpel, increasing and decreasing the size of the electric
machine and varying the method of preparation of the
frog, so as to decide just what the significance of the
phenomenon was. In a general way, it may be said
that this study shows Galvani as one of the most careful
of experimentalists, though he has often been declared
to be a theorizer, rather than an observer.

A very interesting anticipation of Galvani's original
experiment, made long before his time by a great
naturalist, the story of which serves to show that
discoveries made before their time, that is, before people
are ready to follow them up, fail to attract attention, has
been called to my attention by Brother Potamian. In
the second volume of the Dutch Naturalist Swammerdam's
Works, page 839, is to be found the following
passage:[13] "Another experiment that is at once very
curious and suggestive can be made if one separates the
largest of the muscles of the thigh of the frog and so
prepares it with its adherent nerve as to leave it unhurt.
If after this has been done you take the tendons of this
muscle, one in each hand, and irritate the hanging nerve
by a little forceps or other instrument, the muscle will
recover the former motion which it had lost. You will
see at once that it contracts and that there will be an
effort as it were to bring together the two hands which
hold its tendons. This I demonstrated, in the year 1658,
to the illustrious Duke of Tuscany then reigning, when
he was at the moment in a state of mind that prompted
him not to favor me. This same experiment can be
repeated with the same muscle as often and for as long
a time as any portion of the nerve remains uninjured, so
that we may, therefore, irritate the muscle to its former
contraction as often as we wish."

As a foundation classic in electricity, Galvani's De
Viribus Electricitatis deserves more detailed analysis.
The first part of the monograph is taken up with
experiments of many kinds, with what may be called
artificial sources of electricity       the electric machine, the
Leyden jar, and other modes of electrical development.
The second part treats of the effects of atmospheric
electricity upon muscular motion, by which expression
Galvani means lightning, though he also observed various
electrical manifestations in the muscles of his frogs
when there was no actual lightning but only darkening
of the heavens, without actual passage of the current
flash from one cloud to another or from the clouds to the
earth. In this matter, Galvani displayed quite as much
courage as patient observation. He knew the fate of
Richmann, the Russian scientist, who had been struck
dead by a lightning-bolt while making experiments not
very different, yet he dared to place a lightning conductor
on the highest point of his house, and to this
conductor he attached a wire, which ran down to his
laboratory. During a storm, he suspended on this
metallic circuit, by means of their sciatic nerves, frogs'
legs and the legs of other animals prepared for the purpose.
To the feet of the animals he attached another
Wire sufficiently long to reach down to the bottom of a
well, thus grounding the circuit.

Not satisfied with this study of the influence of
lightning and large electrical disturbances in the air
on the preparation of the frog as he had made it, Galvani
set about discovering whether even the slight
differences in electrical potential which occur during
the day in atmospheric electricity might not give rise,
even in fair weather, to certain contractions of the
frog's muscles. He made his observations for many
days at many different hours and under varying conditions
of light and shade, of heat and cold, without
finding anything. There were occasional contractions,
but they bore no definite relation to variations
in the atmosphere, or the electric state of the atmosphere.
Galvani satisfied himself of this very
thoroughly, and with a patience and diligence worthy
of emulation by a Fellow at a modern university working
on a foundation for the determination of a particular
question.

The third part of the work is the most important as well
as the longest, and contains the ideas which are original
with Galvani, but which met most opposition in his
time and have only been properly appreciated in recent
years. Galvani came to the conclusion that there is
such a thing as animal electricity. This led to a
famous controversy with Volta, in which their contemporaries
judged that Galvani had the worst of it;
but, as so often happens, their successors a century
later would judge that Galvani's views were more in
accord with what we know at the present time. Criticism
is always easier than scientific advance, and in a
controversy it is usually the man who writes most forcibly,
rather than the one who thinks most deeply, who
secures the assent of readers. This makes controversy
in matters of science always unfortunate, for it does
much more to retard than to help scientific progress.

Galvani insists, at the end of this chapter on animal
electricity, that what he writes is entirely the result of
experiment, and that he has tried in every way to make
his experiments from a thoroughly critical standpoint.
Those who repeat his observations will find this to be
true, though he confesses that there are times when
conditions not well understood seem to hinder the results
that he usually obtained.

The fourth part of his commentary is taken up with
certain conjectures, as he calls them, and some conclusions
from his work. In this he suggests the use of
electricity for the cure of certain nervous diseases, and
especially for the treatment of the various forms of
paralysis. The use of electricity for these cases had
been previously suggested, and Bertholinus had told
the story of patients who were utterly unable to move
and who had recovered after having been in the neighborhood
where a lightning-bolt had struck. To the
minds of physicians of that time, this must have seemed
proof positive of the curative value of lightning, and,
therefore, of electricity, for paralytic conditions. The
remedy was heroic, if not indeed positively risky, but its
good effect could not be doubted. Unfortunately, as is
always true in medical matters, the real question at
issue in these cases is not so much the value of the
remedy as the propriety of the diagnosis. Paralysis,
in the sense of inability to use one or more limbs, may
be due to many causes. There are a number of forms
of functional or hysterical palsy, that is, of incapacity
to use certain groups of muscles not dependent on any
organic lesion, but upon some curious state of the nervous
system which may pass away entirely, and which,
indeed, seem to be dependent on the patient's state of
mind. A number of so-called paralytic patients were
cured by the earthquake in San Francisco; some are made
to do the apparently impossible every year; they get up
and walk because of the shock due to a fire or burglars.
We know now that the electrical status of the individual
is very carefully protected from disturbance by external
electrical forces. What Galvani began has borne fruit in
diagnosis more than treatment, so that his prophecy has
been amply fulfilled. "The application of this method
may throw light on the subject and experience may help
us to understand it."

Among his conclusions, Galvani hints that electricity
may not only proceed from the clouds during electrical
disturbances, but also may proceed from the earth itself,
and that living beings may be affected by this.
He suggests, therefore, that plants and animals may
be influenced in their growth and in their health by
such electrical changes. He adds the suggestion that
there may be some intimate connection between electrical
phenomena and earthquakes, and suggests that, in
countries where earthquakes are frequent, observations
should be made by means of frogs' limbs in order to see
whether there may not be some definite change in the
electrical conditions of the atmosphere before and during
the earthquake. He seems to have had some idea
that the curious feelings which at times come before
an earthquake to human beings, though they seem
even more noticeable in animals, may be due to this
change in atmospheric electricity.[14]

We are rather prone to think that news of scientific
discoveries traveled slowly in Europe in the eighteenth
century. There is abundant evidence of the contrary in
these sketches of electricians, and Galvani's case is one
of the most striking. How much attention Galvani's
discovery attracted and how soon definite details of it
spread to the other end of Europe may be judged from
the fact that, in 1793, Mr. Richard Fowler published
a small book at Edinburgh bearing the title, Experiments
and Observations Relative to the Influence Lately
Discovered by M. Galvani, and commonly called Animal
Electricity.[15] This little book, which may be seen at
the Surgeons General Library, Washington, and in the
Library of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers,
New York, details a large number of experiments
that Fowler had made during the preceding year
or more, so that Galvani's work must have reached
him within a few months after its publication. Fowler
mentions the fact that Galvani had been occupied many
years before this in the study of electric fishes, especially
the torpedo, the gymnotus electricus and silurus electricus.
He also mentions a curious observation of Cotugno,
who, a few years before, had received a shock from a
mouse while dissecting the little animal, which makes
it clear that imagination played a role in helping to the
introduction of the newer ideas with regard to animal
electricity.[16]

But before his discovery was to attract so much attention,
Galvani had to work it out, and this is the
merit of the man.

It is almost needless to say, these experiments upon
frogs were not accomplished in a few days or a few
weeks. Galvani had his duties as Professor of Anatomy
to attend to besides the obligations imposed upon him as
a busy practitioner of medicine and surgery. At that
time, it was not nearly so much the custom as it is at the
present, to use frogs for experiments, with the idea
that conclusions might be obtained of value for the biological
sciences generally, and especially for medicine.
There has always been such an undercurrent of feeling,
that such experiments have been more or less a beating
of the air. Galvani found this opposition not only to
his views with regard to animal electricity as enunciated
after experimental demonstration, but also met with no
little ridicule because of the supposed waste of time at
occupations that could not be expected to lead to any
practical results. It was the custom of scientific men
to laugh somewhat scornfully at his patient persistence
in studying out every detail of electrical action on the
frog, and one of the supposedly prominent scientists of
the time even dubbed him "the frog dancing master."
This did not, however, deter Galvani from his work,
though some of the bitter things must have proved cutting
enough, and might have discouraged a smaller
man, less confident of the scientific value of the work
that he was doing.

His relations with his patients       for during all of his
career he continued to practice, especially surgery and
obstetrics       were of the friendliest character. While
his distinction as a professor at the University gave
him many opportunities for practice among the rich, he
was always ready and willing to help the poor, and, indeed,
seemed to feel more at home among poor patients
than in the society of the wealthy and the noble. Even
toward the end of his life, when the loss of many
friends, and especially his wife, made him retire within
himself much more than before, he continued to exercise
his professional skill for the benefit of the poor, though
he often refused to take cases that might have proved
sources of considerable gain to him. Early in life,
when he was very busy between his professorial work
and his practice, he remarked more than once, on refusing
to take the cases of wealthy patients, that they
had the money with which to obtain other physicians,
while the poor did not, and he would prefer to keep
some time for his services to them. When ailing and
miserable toward the end of his life, he still continued
his practice, and was especially ready to spend his time
with the poor. He was dying himself, as one of his
biographers says, when he got up from a sick bed to
see a dying woman who sent for him.

He was one of the most popular professors that the
University of Bologna ever had. He was not, in the
ordinary sense of the word, an orator, but he was a
born teacher. The source of the enthusiasm which he
aroused in his hearers was undoubtedly his own love
for teaching and the power it gave him to express even
intricate problems in simple, straightforward language.
More than any of his colleagues, he understood that
experiments and demonstrations must be the real
groundwork of the teaching of science. Accordingly,
very few of his lectures were given without the aid of
these material helps to attract attention. Besides, he
was known to be one who delighted to answer questions,
and was perfectly frank about the limitations of his
knowledge whenever there was no real answer to be
given to a question that had been proposed. Though
an original discoverer of the first rank, he was extremely
modest, particularly when talking about the
details of his discoveries or subjects relating to them.

Galvani was not a good talker, though he seems to
have been a good teacher. He had little of that facility
which wins friends easily and enables a man to shine
with a borrowed lustre of knowledge, often enough
quite superficial. What he said was almost sure to have
a very serious meaning. While there is no doubt that
Galvani was a genius, in the sense that he was one of
the precious few who take the step across the boundary
of the unknown and make a path along which it is easy
for others to follow in reaching hitherto trackless
regions in human speculation, he also had what is undoubtedly
the main element in talent, for he was possessed
to a high degree of the faculty for hard work.
For this he regulated the hours of his labor very carefully.
Only thus could he have accomplished what he
did. It must not be forgotten that he was teaching
anatomy and obstetrics at the University of Bologna,
and, surprising as it may seem, doing both these tasks
well. He was besides accomplishing good work in comparative
anatomy and physiology by original investigations
of a high order. In spite of all this, which would
seem occupation enough and more for any one man, he
was able to keep up a rather demanding practice.

He did not have many friends, but those whom he
admitted to his intimacy were bound to him with the
proverbial hoops of steel. With two men in Bologna he
spent most of his leisure. They were Dr. Julio Cæsare
Cingari, a distinguished physician of the city, and the
well-known astronomer who held the chair of astronomy
at the University, Francisco Sacchetti. With these he
passed many a pleasant hour, and week after week they
met at one another's houses to discuss scientific questions
and the lighter topics of the day. Galvani was
thoroughly respected by all the members of the Faculty
at Bologna, though he did not seek many friendships, and
indeed probably would have more or less resented the
intrusions of acquaintances, because of the time that it
would take from him. He was a very retiring man,
caring not at all for social things, and least of all for
that personal fame which has been so well defined as
the being known by those whom one does not know.
His happiness in life came to him from his work and
from his domestic relations. His wife was one of those
marvelous women, rarer than they should be, one is
tempted to say, who are enough interested in their husband's
intellectual work to add to the zest of discovery
in the discussion of it with them, and who yet realize
that it is by minimizing the little worries of life that
they can best help their husbands.

A very interesting phase of the Italian University life
of that time is revealed in two important incidents of
Galvani's university career. One of his professors       one,
by the way, for whom he seems to have had a great
deal of respect, and to whose lectures he devoted much
attention, was Laura Caterina Maria Bassi, the distinguished
woman Professor of Philosophy at the University
of Bologna, about the middle of the eighteenth
century. It is doubtless to her teaching that Galvani
owes some of his thorough-going conservatism in philosophic
speculation, a conservatism that was of great
service to him later on in life, in the midst of the ultra-radical
principles which became fashionable just before
and during the French Revolution. Madame Bassi
seems to have had her influence on him for good not only
during his student career, but also later in life, for she
was the wife of a prominent physician in Bologna, and
Galvani was often in social contact with her during her
years of connection with the University.

As might, perhaps, be expected, seeing that his own
happy domestic life showed him that an educated
woman might be the center of intellectual influence,
Galvani seems to have had no spirit of opposition to
even the highest education for women. This is very
well illustrated by the first formal lecture in his course
on anatomy at the University, which had for its subject
the models for the teaching of anatomy that had been
made by Madame Manzolini.[17] In the early part of the
eighteenth century, Madame Manzolini had been the
Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bologna, and
in order to make the teaching of this difficult subject
easier and more definite, she modeled with great care
and delicate attention to every detail, so that they imitated
actual dissections of the human body very closely,
a set of wax figures, which replaced the human body for
demonstration purposes, at least at the beginning of the
anatomical course.

Galvani, in taking up the work of lecturer in anatomy,
appreciated how much such a set of models would
serve to make the introduction to anatomical study
easy, yet at the same time without diminishing its exactness,
and accordingly introduced his students to Madame
Manzolini's set of models in his very first lecture. At
the time, not a few of the teachers of anatomy at the
Italian universities were inclined to consider the use of
these models as rather an effeminate proceeding. Galvani's
lack of prejudice in the matter shows the readiness
of the man to accept the best, wherever he found it,
without regard to persons or feelings.

Galvani's personal character was very pleasant, yet
rather grave and serious. His panegyrist, Professor
Giuseppe Venturoli, in the eulogium of Galvani, delivered
in the Public Academy of the Institute of Bologna
(1802) within five years after Galvani's death, says that
Galvani was far from that coldness or lack of interest
which sometimes characterizes scientists in their social
relations, and which, as he naïvely says, is sometimes
praised and sometimes blamed by those who write about
them. Another side of Galvani's character is more
interesting. He was ready to do all in his power for the
poor. He conducted his obstetrical clinic particularly
with a liberal benevolence and charity that deserve to
be mentioned. When it is considered how much time
his teaching and his charity took from him, it is rather
surprising to find that he had enough left to enable him
to devote himself with so much success to the difficult
tasks he set himself in research and to the time-taking
labors of controversy, which occupied many years after
the announcement of his discoveries.

The most striking proof of the thorough conscientiousness
with which he faced the duties of life is to be
found in his conduct after the establishment of the
so-called Cis-Alpine Republic in Italy. This was a government
established merely by force of arms, maintained
through French influence, without the consent of the
people, and a plain usurpation of the rights of the previous
government. Galvani considered himself bound in
duty to the authority under which he had lived all his
previous life and to which he had sworn fealty. When
the University of Bologna was reorganized under the
new government, the first requirement of all those who
were made professors was that they should take the
oath of allegiance to the new government. This he
refused to do. His motives can be readily understood,
and though practically all the other professors of the
University had taken the oath, he did not consider that
this freed him from his conscientious obligations in the
matter.

Accordingly he was dropped from the roll of professors
and deprived of the never very large salary
which he had obtained from this chair. On this sum he
had practically depended for his existence, and he began
to suffer from want. While he had been a successful
practitioner of medicine, especially of surgery, he had
always been very liberal, and had spent large sums of
money in demonstrations for his lectures and personal
experimentation and in materials for the museums of
the University. He began to suffer from actual want,
and friends had to come to his assistance. He refused,
however, to give up his scruples in the matter and
accept the professorship which was still open to him.
Finally, at the end of two years, influence was brought to
bear on the new government, and Galvani was allowed
to accept his chair in the University without taking
the oath of allegiance. This tribute came too late, however,
and within a short time after his restoration to his
professorship he died.

Galvani's conduct in this affair is the key-note to his
character and conduct through life. For him duty was
the paramount word, and success meant the accomplishment
of duty. For getting on in the world and material
rewards he had no use unless they came as the
consequence of duty fulfilled. His action in the matter
of the University professorship has of course been much
discussed by his biographers.

His eulogist, Professor Venturoli, whom we have
already quoted, and whose eulogium is to be found in
the complete edition of Galvani's works issued at Bologna
in 1841,[18] has much to say with regard to Galvani's
religious sentiments.

He says: "The great founder in electricity was deeply
religious, and his piety clothed a heart that was not less
affectionate and sensitive to affection than it was intrepid
and courageous. When called upon to take the
civic oath in a formula involved in ambiguous words, he
did not believe that he ought, on so serious an occasion,
to permit himself anything but the clear and precise expression
of his sentiments, full as they were of honesty
and rectitude. Refusing to take advantage of the suggestion
that he should modify the oath by some declaration
apart from the prescribed formula, though it might
still be generally understood that he had taken the
oath, he refused constantly to commit himself to any
such subterfuge. It is not our duty here to ask whether
his conclusion was correct or not. He followed the
voice of his conscience, which ever must be the standard
of duty, and it certainly would have been a fault to have
deviated from it. It is sad to think that this great man,
deprived of his position, saw himself, for an instant at
least, exposed to the danger of ending his career, deprived
of the recompense which he so richly deserved and to
which his past services to the State and the University
had given him so just a title. This is all the more sad
when we realize that the vicissitudes of his delicate
health, much more than his age, now rendered such recompense
doubly necessary. It is a gracious thing to
recall, however, the noble firmness with which he maintained
himself against so serious a blow. His courage
is all the more admirable as one can see how absolutely
without affectation it is. He was not ostentatious in his
goodness, and did not permit himself to be cast down
by the unfortunate conditions, but constantly preserved
in the midst of adverse fortune that modest, imperturbable
and dignified conduct which had always characterized
him in the midst of his prosperity and his
glory."

That his action in this matter was very properly
appreciated by his contemporaries, and that the moral
influence of his example was not lost, can be realized
from the expressions used by Alibert, the Secretary-General
of the Medical Society of Emulation, in the
historical address on Galvani which he delivered before
that society in Paris in 1801:

"Galvani constantly refused to take the civil oath
demanded by the decrees of the Cis-Alpine Republic.
Who can blame him for having followed the voice of his
conscience       that sacred, interior voice which alone prescribes
the duties of man and which has preceded all
human laws? Who could not praise him for having
sacrificed all such exemplary resignation, all the emoluments
of his professorship, rather than violate the
solemn engagements made under religious sanction?"

In the same panegyric there is a very curiously interesting
passage with regard to Galvani's habit of frequently
closing his lectures by calling attention to the complexity
yet the purposefulness of natural things,
and the inevitable conclusion that they must have been
created with a definite purpose by a Supreme Being
possessed of intelligence. At the time that Alibert wrote
his memoir, it was the fashion to consider, at least in
France, that Christianity was a thing of the past, and
that while theism might remain, that would be all that
could be expected to survive the crumbling effect of the
emancipation of man.

He says: "We have seen already what was Galvani's
zeal and his love for the religion which he professed.
We may add that, in his public demonstrations, he
never finished his lectures without exhorting his pupils
to a renewal of their faith, by leading them always back
to the idea of the eternal Providence which develops,
preserves and causes life to flow among so many different
kinds of things. I write now," he continues,
"in the age of reason, of tolerance and of light. Must
I then defend Galvani in the eyes of posterity for one
of the most beautiful sentiments that can spring from
the nature of man? No; and they are but little initiated
in the saner mechanism of philosophy who refuse to
recognize the truths established on evidence so strong
and so authentic. Breves haustus in philosophia ad
atheismum ducunt, longiores autem reducunt ad Deum       Small
draughts of philosophy lead to atheism, but
longer draughts bring one back to God"       (which may
be better translated, perhaps, for English readers by
Pope's well known lines, "A little learning [in philosophy]
is a dangerous thing; drink deep or touch not the
Pierian spring").

Galvani has been honored by his fellow-citizens of
Bologna as one of their greatest townsmen, and by the
University as one of her worthiest sons. In 1804, a
medal was struck in his honor, on the reverse of which,
surrounding a figure of the genius of science, were the
two legends: "Mors mihi vita," "Death is life for me,"
and "Spiritus intus alit," "The spirit works within,"
which were favorite expressions of the great scientist
while living, and are lively symbols of the spirit which
animated him. In 1814, a monument was erected to
him in the courtyard of the University of Bologna. It
is surmounted by his bust, made by the most distinguished
Bolognian sculptor of the time, De Maria. On
the pedestal there are two figures in bas-relief, executed
by the same sculptor, which represent religion and
philosophy, the inspiring genius of Galvani's life.

Before he died, he asked, as had his favorite poet
Dante, whose Divina Commedia had been one of the
pleasures of life and above all one of the consolations of
his times of adversity, to be buried in the humble habit
of a member of the Third Order of St. Francis. He is
said to have valued his fellowship with the sons of the
"poor little man of Assisi" more than the many honorary
fellowships of various kinds which had been conferred
upon him by scientific societies all over Europe.
With him passed away one of the great pioneers of
modern science and one of the most lovable men in all
the history of science. His death took place just before
the close of the eighteen century, Dec. 4, 1798, but his
work was destined to be one of the harbingers of a
great period of electrical development.

[14] With Galvani's attention to medical electricity, it is not surprising that for several
years, beginning with 1873, an Italian medical journal called Il Galvani, with the
sub-title Giornale di Elettro-Idro-ed Aero Terapia, was published at Milan. Its directors
were the brothers Themistocles and Ulysses Santopadre. Those who think that
an exaggeration of claims for electrical influence on various diseases is of comparatively
recent date, will do well to consult that journal. The prophylaxis of yellow-fever is
suggested by means of static electricity. The cause of yellow-fever is declared to be
a disturbance of the electro-magnetic conditions of the body. Everything, from
skin diseases to uterine inertia, chloroform asphyxia, aphasia, and the various forms
of paralysis, and Basedow's disease, are described as cured by electrical treatment.
So does science become the nursing mother of quackery.

Irishmen often went to Edinburgh for their scientific training. This thesis serves
to show that Galvani's work was already attracting the attention even of the most
distant of Western Universities.

CHAPTER V.
Volta the Founder of Electrical Science.


Up to the end of the eighteenth century, discoverers
in electrical science had usually been students of science
in other departments, whose attention to electricity had
been attracted in passing as it were. Occasionally,
indeed, they had been only interested amateurs, inquisitive
as to the curious phenomena of magnetism. It
is surprising how many of these pioneers in electricity
were clergymen, though that fact is seldom realized.
It can be seen very readily in my chapter on Clergymen
Pioneers in Electricity, in Catholic Churchmen in Science
(Second Series, Dolphin Press, Phila., 1909). With
Volta's career, however, was initiated the story of the
electrical scientists who devoted themselves almost exclusively
to this department of physics, though more or
less necessarily paying some attention to related subjects.
Volta's discovery of a practical instrument for
measuring electricity, as well as of comparatively simple
apparatus producing a continuous current, changed
the whole face of the science of electricity. After
these inventions, regular work could be readily done in
the investigation of problems in the science of electricity
without discouragement or inadequate instruments,
discontinuous electrical phenomena, disturbances of experiments
by the weather, and other conditions which
had been hitherto so unfavorable to electrical experimentation.
Volta's invention of the pile, or battery,
so deservedly called after him, caused electrical science
to take on an entirely new aspect, and the modern development
of electricity was assured. It has been well
said that no other invention, not even the steam-engine,
meant so much for the transformation of modern life as
this new apparatus for the production of a continuous
electric current.



Alessandro Volta


The man who worked this revolution in electrical
science was no mere inventor who, by a happy chance,
brought together practical factors that had been well
known before but had never been combined. He was
one of the greatest scientists of a period particularly rich
in examples of original scientific genius of a high order.
Before his death, he came to be acknowledged by the
scientific world of his time as one of the greatest leaders
of thought, not alone in electricity, but in all departments
of the physical sciences. His life forms for this
reason an important chapter in the history of science
and scientific development.

Like most of the distinguished scientific discoverers
of the last two centuries, Alessandro Volta was born in
very humble circumstances. His father was a member
of the Italian nobility, but had wasted his patrimony so
completely that the family was in extreme poverty
when the distinguished son was born, on the eighteenth
of February, 1745. This poverty was so complete that
Volta said of it, later in life: "My father owned nothing
except a small dwelling worth about fourteen thousand
lire; and as he left behind him seventeen thousand
lire of debt, I was actually poorer than poor." A good
idea of the circumstances in which Volta's childhood
was passed may be gathered from the fact that he could
not even secure copy-books for his first school exercises
except through the kindness of friends.

Volta had shown signs of genius from early boyhood,
and yet had been discouragingly slow in his intellectual
development as a child. In fact, it was feared that he
was congenitally lacking in intelligence to a great degree.
It is said that he was more than four years old before
he ever uttered a word. This does not mean before he
learned to talk connectedly, but before he could utter
even such familiar expressions as "father," "mother,"
and the like. He was considered to be dumb; and, as is
not infrequently the mistaken notion with regard to
children dumb for any reason, he was thought to be
almost an idiot. The first word he ever uttered is said
to have been a vigorous "No!" which was heard when
one of his relatives insisted on his doing something that
he did not wish to do. At the age of seven, however,
he had so far overcome all difficulties of speech as to be
looked upon as a very bright child. Owing to this late,
unexpected development, his parents seem to have regarded
him as a sort of living miracle, and felt certain
that he was destined to accomplish great things. His
father said of him later, "We had a jewel in the house
and did not know it."

Fortunately for Volta, one of his uncles was archdeacon
of the Cathedral, and another was one of the canons.
These relatives helped him to obtain an education, the
way being made especially easy by the fact that at this
time all the Jesuit Colleges subsisted on foundations
and collected no fees from any of their students; so
that all that was necessary for his uncles to do for him
was to contribute to his expenses outside of college.
According to tradition, the Jesuits not only helped Volta
in his education, but assisted him in obtaining his books
and even in his living expenses while at their college.
At the age of about sixteen, his education was complete,
even including a year of philosophy. This is probably
an indication of his talent as a student; though it was
not an unusual thing in the southern countries for students
to graduate at sixteen, or even younger, after a
course equivalent to that now required for the bachelor's
degree in arts.

We have gotten far away from this early graduation,
although it is still sometimes possible in Italian
universities; and one of the brightest men I ever knew
was an Italian who had graduated with a degree equivalent
to our A. B. before he was sixteen. When Volta
graduated, however, such early completion of the undergraduate
course was not at all unusual in Italy,
and boys of thirteen and fourteen, almost as a rule,
entered the undergraduate department to complete their
course for a degree at seventeen or eighteen. One
of our greatest physicians in this country, Benjamin
Rush, was only seventeen when he completed his college
course, and such examples were not at all rare. Indeed,
the possibility for these men to devote themselves
much earlier than is possible now to their serious
life-work, yet with the development of mind which
comes from a University course in the arts, was
probably a distinct help to the success of their scientific
careers. One is tempted to think that possibly such
justification of earlier graduation, as we find among the
distinguished scientists of a century ago, might make us
reflect deeply before lending ourselves to what Herbert
Spencer thought a phase of evolution, the lengthening
of childhood, for it is just possible that the earlier
recognition of manhood may mean more for individual
development. Of course, geniuses are exceptions to
rule, and an argument founded on their careers may
mean very little for the generality of students.

Like many another of the great scientists, Volta was
not that constant source of satisfaction to his teachers
while at school that might possibly be expected. He
had little interest in the conventional elementary education
of the time, he was frequently distracted during
school hours, and even as a mere boy often asked questions
with regard to natural phenomena that were puzzlers
to his masters, and sometimes complained of their
lack of knowledge. He fortunately outgrew this priggishness,
for in later childhood he seems to have been
one of those talented children who learn rapidly and who
are impatient at being kept back while their slower
fellow-pupils are having drilled into them what came
so easy to readier talents.

In his classical studies, however, Volta was deeply
interested. He was especially enthusiastic over poetry,
and at school devoted the spare time that his readiness
of acquisition left him to the reading of Virgil and Tasso.
These favorite authors became so familiar to him that
he could repeat much of them by heart, and even in old
age could cap verses from them better than any of his
friends, even those all of whose lives had been devoted
exclusively to literary occupations. During his walks,
when an old man, he often entertained himself by repeating
long passages from the classic Latin and Italian
poets.

Even at this time, Volta's interest in the physical
sciences was very marked. There is still extant a Latin
poem of about five hundred verses, in which he sets
forth the observations of Priestley, the discoverer of
oxygen, whom it used to be the custom to call the
Father of Modern Chemistry. This poem shows his
thorough familiarity with the work of the great English
investigator. Volta's model was Lucretius. Lest it
should be a source of surprise that an Italian scientist
had recourse to Latin for even a poetic account of scientific
discoveries, it may be well to recall that Latin was
still the universal language of science at that time, and
Volta's great contemporary in electricity, Galvani, wrote
his original monograph on animal electricity in that
language, and even the Father of Pathology wrote his
first great treatise, De Causis et Sedibus Morborum,
in that tongue. As to his adoption of verse as a vehicle
for scientific writing, it must not be forgotten that, at
the time when Volta was writing his poem, another
distinguished writer on scientific subjects, Erasmus
Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin of the last
generation, was composing his "Zoonomia; or, Animal
Biography," in English verse. Didactic verse was
quite the fashion of the time, and some of it, even when
it came from acknowledged poets, had not more poetry
than Volta's effusion.

As if to make up for his lack of linguistic faculty
when young, Volta seems to have had a special gift for
languages when he grew older. Before the age of
twenty, he knew French as well as his mother tongue,
read German and English fluently, and Low Dutch and
Spanish were not beyond his comprehension. Besides
his verses in Latin he wrote poetry also in French and
Italian, always with cleverness at least, and at times
with true poetic feeling.

While attending the Jesuit school, he expressed, it is
said, a desire to enter the Order. As his father, however,
had been with the Jesuits for eleven years and
had then given up his studies, his family feared a repetition
of such an experience; and so his clergymen
uncles took him away from the school and sent him for
a while to the Seminary at Benzi. After a time Volta
abandoned the idea of becoming a priest, but would not
consent to follow the wishes of the family council
further, at least not to the extent of becoming a lawyer.
Though he studied law for a time, he constantly
wandered away to the reading of books on the natural
sciences and to the study of natural objects. Finally
he was allowed to give up law to devote himself exclusively
to science.

Fortunately, one of the canons of the Cathedral of
Como, a former fellow-student of his and a man of considerable
means, was also interested in the natural
sciences, and obtained the books and instruments
necessary to enable Volta and himself to continue their
studies. Father Gattoni seems to have realized at once
the possibilities for great advances in science that lay
in Volta's wonderful powers of observation, and encouraged
him in every way. As a consequence, some
of the important experiments that laid the foundation
of the modern science of electricity and proved the beginning
of Volta's world-wide reputation were carried
on in Gattoni's rooms.

As a young man, Volta was so completely devoted to
scientific investigations that there could be no doubt of
the bent of his genius for original work of a high order.
His power of concentration of attention on a subject
was supreme. Biographers emphasize that there was
no time, much less inclination, for the levities that so
often appeal to the growing youth. He was almost too
staid and preoccupied with his work for his own health
and the comfort of his friends. When he became interested
in a series of experiments, he often forgot the
flight of time, and was known to miss meals, and inadvertently
to put off going to bed       apparently quite unconscious
of his physical necessities. This intense concentration
of mind had its disadvantages. One of his friends
complained playfully that he made a rather disagreeable
traveling companion on account of his tendency to become
abstracted; and on occasions this friend was deeply
mortified to see Volta, when in company, take out a
pocket-handkerchief that had been used for some purpose
in the laboratory       which showed unmistakable
signs of its previous employment as a cleansing agent
for dirty instruments or hands, though its possessor was
evidently unconscious of its appearance. More than
once, too, his handkerchief proved, when taken out for
its natural uses, to be as preoccupied as its owner: specimens
of rocks or natural curiosities that he had gathered
and inadvertently allowed to remain in his pocket came
with it.

All during his life he retained an unusual faculty for
concentrating his attention, which at times amounted to
complete abstraction from his surroundings. It is related
that, one cold morning his students at the University of
Pavia found him in his shirt sleeves, so intent on arranging
the experiments that were to illustrate his morning
lecture that he was unconscious of the time, and even
did not notice their coming into the room until they had
been for some time in their seats and he had finally
completed the arrangement for the demonstrations. He
was constantly occupied with problems in natural science,
looking for the explanation of phenomena that he did not
understand as well as gathering new data by observation
and experiment. He was gifted with the supremely
inquisitive spirit, in the scientific sense of the epithet,
and could not be satisfied with accepting things as he
found them without knowing the reasons for them.

Volta furnishes another excellent illustration of how
soon genius gets at its life-work. We have his own
authority for the fact that he had come to certain conclusions
with regard to the explanation of electrical phenomena,
which, when he was only nineteen years of age,
he set forth in a letter to the Abbé Nollet, who was then
one of the best known experimenters and writers on electrical
phenomena in Europe. Though so young, Volta
had tried to simplify Franklin's theory of electricity by
assuming that there was an action only between a (supposed)
electrical substance and matter. It is curious to
see how much he anticipated what was to be the thinking
for more than a century after his time and practically
down to the present day. He considers that all bodies, in
their normal state, contain electricity in such proportion
that electrical equilibrium is established within them.
Electrical phenomena, then, are due to disturbances of
this equilibrium. Such disturbances may be produced
by physical means, as by friction or by chemical means,
and even atmospheric electricity may be explained in
the former way.

Volta's first formal paper on electricity, bearing the
title De Vi Attractiva Ignis Electrici, was published in
1769, when he was twenty-four years of age. His
second paper, Novus Ac Simplicissimus, Electricorum
Tentaminum Apparatus       New and Very Simple. Apparatus
for Electrical Tests, shows that Volta was getting
beyond the stage of theorizing about electricity into
the experimental work, which was to form the foundation
of his contributions to electrical science. It is not
surprising, then, that when he was just past thirty, in
1775, he was able to announce to Priestley his invention
of the electrophorus. Priestley is usually thought of
as one of the founders of modern chemistry, but he was
known to his own generation, especially at this time, as
the writer of a very interesting and complete history of
electricity. It is characteristic of Volta's careful ways,
that the reason for his letter to Priestley was in order
to obtain information from him as to what extent this
invention, which Volta knew, as far as he was concerned,
to be original with himself, was novel in the
domain of electrical advance.[19]

With the intense interest in his work that we have
noted, it is not surprising to find Volta's investigations
proving fruitful. His active inventive genius stood
him in good stead in enabling him to demonstrate principles
by working instruments. The electrophorus is
but one of the instruments that show the very practical
character of the man. He was especially taken with the
idea of securing some method of measuring electricity.
Among other things, he invented the condensing electroscope,
in which, instead of the ribbons of gold leaf now
employed, he used straws. With this instrument he was
able to demonstrate the presence of minute quantities
of electricity developed under circumstances in which
ordinarily the occurrence of any such phenomena would
be unsuspected. These two instruments, the electroscope
and the electrophorus, lifted the department of
electricity out of the realm of theory into that of accurate
scientific demonstration, and made the electrical
departments of the physical laboratories of the time
much more interesting and important than they had
been before.

Though so early occupied with electricity, Volta did
not confine himself to this subject, nor even to the wider
field of physics, and that he did not hesitate, in his
scientific inquisitiveness, to follow clues even in chemistry,
is well illustrated by his first step in the investigation
of gases. His attention being called to bubbles
breaking on the surface of Lake Maggiore while on a
fishing excursion, he set about finding their source, and
noted that whenever the bottom of the lake near the
shore was stirred somewhat a number of bubbles arose,
and that the gas thus set free was inflammable. He
constructed an electrical pistol in which gases thus set
free were exploded by a spark from the electrophorus.
About the same time, on the principle of the electrical
pistol, he invented the eudiometer, an apparatus by
means of which the oxygen content of air could be
determined.

With regard to these inventions, Arago calls attention
to a special quality that is peculiar to all of Volta's
work. "There is not a single one of the discoveries of
Professor Volta," says the distinguished French scientist,
"which can be said to be the result of chance.
Every instrument with which he has enriched science
existed in principle in his imagination before an artisan
began to put it into a material shape."

After these inventions and his previous work, it is not
surprising that in 1774 Volta was offered the professorship
of experimental physics in the College of Como.
Here he labored for five years, until he received a call,
in 1779, to the professorship of physics at the University
of Pavia, where he was destined to remain in an active
teaching capacity for a period of forty years.

Volta began his life-work as professor of physics at
Pavia by extending his observations on gases. He was
the first to demonstrate the expansion of gases under
heat, especially as regards their increased expansibility
at higher temperatures. Many observers had been at
work on this problem before his time, but there were
serious discrepancies in the results reported. Volta was
the first to point out the reasons for the apparent inconsistencies
of previous investigators' findings; and from
his observations alone some valuable data might have
been obtained for the establishment of what has since
become known as the "law of Charles."

At this time, his knowledge of English enabled him to
follow English discoveries closely, and he seems to have
paid particular attention to the work of Cavendish and
Priestley. Not long after Cavendish's description of
the method of obtaining pure hydrogen, Volta made a
series of observations on the relations of spongy platinum
to this gas, and pointed out the spontaneous ignition
that takes place when the two substances are brought
together. This experiment is the basis of what has
since been known as the hydrogen lamp, called, from
the German observer who first made it a practical
instrument, Dobereiner's lamp.

After seven years of teaching, Volta was given the
opportunity to visit various parts of Europe, and took
advantage of the occasion to meet most of the celebrated
men of science. His linguistic faculty stood him in
good stead during this sabbatical year, and his travel
aided him in completing a thorough acquaintanceship
with European languages as well as with scientists. His
practical character led him, during his trip, to note the
growth of the potato and its uses in various European
countries, and he brought the plant home with him to
Italy in order to introduce it among the farmers. He
succeeded in making his countrymen realize its value,
and the introduction of the potato is one of the reasons
for which Italians have always looked up to him as a
benefactor of his native land. How modern this makes
a vegetable we are inclined to think of as having been
always an important food resource of the race!

About the middle of the third quarter of the eighteenth
century, by one of the fortunate accidents that
happen, however, only to genius, Galvani, at the time
Professor of anatomy in Bologna, had been led to make
the observation that if a frog, so prepared that its hind
leg is attached to the trunk only by means of the sciatic
nerve, happens to be touched by a metal instrument in
such a way as to put nerve and muscle in connection
with each other through the metal instrument, a very
curious phenomenon is observed, the muscles of the
almost severed leg becoming spasmodically contracted
and then relaxed whenever the contacts were made and
broken. Galvani noted the phenomenon first in connection
with an electric machine, and looked for an explanation
of it in electricity, thinking that there was an
analogy between it and the discharge of the Leyden jar.
After several years of careful observation, he published
a monograph on the subject, which at once attracted
attention all over Europe.

Volta was very much interested in Galvani's work,
and took up the development of it from the physical
side. At first he agreed with the explanation offered
by Galvani, who considered that his experiment demonstrated
the presence of electricity in animal bodies,
and who proposed to introduce the term "animal electricity."
After careful investigation, however, Galvani's
assertion that animal electricity existed in a form entirely
independent of any external electricity, though
it had been accepted by most of the distinguished men
of science of the time, seemed to Volta without experimental
verification. For many years his most
determined efforts were used to demonstrate that the
muscle twitchings observed were not due to the presence
of animal electricity (galvanism as it had come to be
called), but to the fact that the metals touching the
different portions of the moist nerve muscle preparation
really set up minute currents of ordinary electricity.

Some of the experiments which he devised for this
purpose were extremely ingenious, and show how
thoroughly empirical were his methods and how modern
his scientific spirit. In the course of his experiments
he found that a difference in the metals of which the
arc was composed, when used for the purpose of eliciting
the so-called animal electricity, made a great difference
in the electrical phenomena observed and in the
amount of muscle twitchings obtained. In one brilliant
series of experiments, moreover, he showed that, even
when the metallic portions touching nerve and muscle
were identical, there might still be distinct electrical
phenomena, if only an artificial difference in temperature
of the end of the metallic arc were produced.
Volta was even able to demonstrate that such minute
physical differences as the filing of one end of the
metallic arc used might give rise to small currents of
electricity.

In the midst of these experiments, he came to the
realization that two portions of metal of different kinds,
separated by a moist non-conducting material, might
be made to produce a constant current of electricity for
some time. More than this, however, he found that
discs of metal of different kinds might be piled on top
of one another with intervening discs of moist cloth,
and so produce proportionately stronger currents as
more and more of the metal plates were employed.
This was the origin of the voltaic pile, as it has been
called       the first battery for the production at will of
regular currents of electricity of definite strength.[20]

While engaged at this he succeeded in demonstrating
what has come to be known as Volta's basic experiment;
namely, that two plates of metal of different kinds
become electrically excited merely by contact. This
was practically the beginning of the great advance in
applied electricity which ushered in our modern electrical
era. It seems a simple matter now, looking back
over the century that has elapsed since then, to have
taken the successive steps that Volta did for the construction
of his electrical pile and for the demonstration
of the principle of contact electricity. Groping, as he
was, in the dark, however, it took him three years to
make the progress that we have described in a few
words. How great his discoveries appeared, even to
the most distinguished of his scientific contemporaries,
can best be judged from an expression of one of the
greatest of French electrical scientists, Arago, who
declared "Volta's pile the most wonderful instrument
that has ever come from the hand of man, not excluding
even the telescope or the steam-engine."

An excellent description of just how Volta made his
electric pile and what he was able to accomplish with
it experimentally in the laboratory, is to be found in
the numbers for January and February, 1900, of the
Stimmen aus Maria-Laach       a literary and scientific
periodical published by the German Jesuits. This article
on Alessandro Volta, by Father Kneller, S. J., was
written shortly after the celebration of the hundredth
anniversary of Volta's invention of the electric pile,
when there had just been a fresh sorting over of Volta's
documents, and contains a very full set of references
to the biographical material for Volta's life. Father
Kneller says:

"Before this, no one thought for a moment of any
possibility of the practical application of electricity.
But all at once the whole situation changed. After
eight years of observation and experiment, Volta accomplished
one day, at the beginning of 1800, in his
laboratory at Como, the construction of an instrument
which was to revolutionize the study and the practical
applications of electricity. He made a pile composed of a
large number of equal-sized copper and zinc discs. On
each copper disc he placed one of zinc, and then on this
a moistened piece of cloth, and continued the series of
alternate discs and cloths in this order until he had a
rather high column. This was an apparatus as simple
as possible and from which no one but Volta could
possibly have promised any results. The inventor,
however, knew what he was about.

"As soon as he had connected the upper and lower
metal plates by means of a wire, there began to flow
from the zinc to the copper a secret something, which
by the application of the ends of the wire to muscles
caused them to twitch; which appeared before the eye
as light; applied to the tongue, gave a sensation of
taste; caused a thin wire to glow and even to burn between
carbon points; produced a blinding light; decomposed
water into its constituents; dissolved hitherto
unknown metals out of salts and earth; made iron
magnetic; directed the magnetic needle out of its path;
inclosed wire coils caused new electric currents to be
set up; to say nothing of the awful spectacle which
occurred when, under the influence of the electric
current, the bodies of executed criminals again gave
movements of the limbs, their thoraxes really heaved
and sank as if they really breathed, and even a dead
grasshopper was caused to spring and apparently to
sing again.

"Only now, after the discovery of this new kind of
electricity       which did not work merely by jerks, but
flowed in a constant stream from pole to pole       only
now was this mighty natural agent won to the service
of man. Volta is, therefore, above all others, the one
who broke ground not only for an immense amount of
new knowledge in physics, chemistry and physiology,
but who also made possible rapid progress in practical
electricity, in telegraphy, in electric motors and power
machines, in electroplating and the marvelous results in
electro-galvanism which constitute our most wonderful
mechanical effects at the present time."

Soon after Volta's discovery of the electric pile, or
voltaic pile, as it was called in his honor, his reputation
spread throughout Europe. At the beginning of 1800,
he sent a detailed description of the voltaic pile to the
Royal Society of London. During the year 1801 the
scientific journals all over Europe were filled with discussions
of his discovery.

The French Academy of Sciences invited him to Paris
in order to demonstrate his discoveries to the members
of that body. Volta was now looking forward to some
peaceful years of study, and, so far as he was personally
concerned, would surely have refused the invitation.
Circumstances were such, however, that it became a
civic duty for him to proceed to Paris.

At this time Napoleon was First Consul, and the
Italian cities wished to propitiate his favor as far as
possible. It was considered a wise thing by the city to
send a special delegation to Paris, and, as they knew
Napoleon was deeply interested in scientific discoveries
that promised practical results, the name of Volta was
suggested as one of the official delegates. As an
associate, Professor Brugnatelli, who had made some
important investigations in chemistry, and who was
later to be an extender of the practical application of
Volta's discoveries by the invention of the first method
of electroplating, was the other member of the delegation.
It is a curious reflection on the facilities for
travel at the time, that it took twenty-six days for the
delegates to reach Paris from Pavia.

Shortly after their arrival in Paris, the travelers
were formally introduced to the members of the French
Institute, and a number of sessions of the Academy
were held, at which Volta's discoveries were discussed.
Volta read a communication on the identity of electricity
and galvanism. Napoleon, as First Consul, was
present at these sessions in the robe of an Academician,
and was not only an interested listener, but occasionally,
by pertinent questions, drew out significant details
of former experiments and Volta's own theories with
regard to the nature of the phenomena observed. At
the end of the first meeting, at which Volta took a
prominent part, Napoleon spent several hours with him
talking about the prospects of electricity.

In his letters to his brothers and to his wife at this
time, Volta expressed his pleasure at finding how much
attention his discoveries were attracting all over Europe.
As he said himself, Germany, France and England were
full of them, and all the distinguished scientists were
eager to do him honor. In France, he was chosen one
of the eight foreign members of the Institute, and was
made Knight Commander of the Legion of Honor and of
the Order of the Iron Crown. Napoleon selected him as
one of the first members of the Italian Academy, which
he was then in course of establishing, and conferred on
him the honor of Senator and Count of the Kingdom of
Italy. The French Academy, after having heard Volta's
own description of his experiments and discoveries, contrary
to its usual custom, voted to him by acclamation
its gold medal. More important still, Bonaparte made
him a present of 6000 lire, and conferred upon him an
annual income of 3000 lire from the public purse. It is
an index of Volta's feeling as a faithful son of the
Church, that as this income was allotted to him from the
revenues of the bishopric of Adria, he would consent to
receive it only after Napoleon's decree had been confirmed
by the Pope.

Volta had been for nearly twenty years in the University
of Pavia before he finally found for himself a
wife. He was then past forty-nine years of age. His
wife was the youngest daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini.
She had six sisters, one of whom became a nun,
and all the others were married before Volta sought the
hand of the youngest. Writing to a friend, he says,
"that her sisters had distinguished themselves so much
by piety, prudence, good sense and practical economy in
their households as well as by the most admirable qualities
of heart and mind, that he considered himself very
fortunate in obtaining a branch from the family tree;
and he took her in preference to others that had been
offered to him, even though they were possessed of
greater physical beauty, more exalted piety and a larger
dowry." The marriage seems to have been a very happy
one, notwithstanding the considerable disparity of ages
and the very matter-of-fact spirit with which it was
entered into by one of the parties at least.

The charming intimacy of his domestic life may be
judged from some of his letters to his wife when he
was traveling. She was always his confidante with
regard to new things in science that he saw, and especially
as regards the kindly reception which he met with
from scientists and the readiness with which they
accepted his views. At first, so many of his ideas were
new, that it is not surprising that they were looked at
somewhat askance by contemporary scientists. When,
on his journeys through France, he noticed the trend of
opinion setting in favor of his views in electricity, he
took pains to tell his wife, and apparently found his
greatest pleasure in having her share the joy of his
triumph.

One of the severest blows that he suffered was the
untimely death of his eldest son, Flaminio, in 1814.
"This loss," he wrote to one of his nephews not long
after, "strikes me so much to heart that I do not think
I shall ever have another happy day." The relations
between himself and his children were all of the kindliest
nature; and the character of the man comes out perhaps
even more clearly in the traditions that are still extant
with regard to the devotion of his servants to him, and
especially his body-servant, Polonio. Volta was always
a simple and unpretentious person, notwithstanding the
fact that scientific and even political honors had been
heaped upon him toward the end of his life. It was
rather difficult, for instance, to get him to change his
old clothes for new ones. This feat was usually accomplished
by Polonio, who, when he thought the time had
arrived for his master to put on the newer clothes,
would engage him in some scientific explanation of a
morning; then handing him the new garments, Volta
would put them on, and would be wearing them for
some time before he noticed it. The old servant was
then generally able to persuade him that it was time to
make the change. Toward the end of his career, Volta
led a retired life in a country house not far from his native
city of Como. Foreigners often came to see or even
have the privilege of a few words with the distinguished
scientist who was regarded as the patriarch of electrical
science. To Volta, the being on exhibition was always
an unpleasant function. He did not care to be lionized,
and frequently refused to allow himself even to be seen
unless his visitors had a scientific motive. On such
occasions, the only chance of the visitors was to secure
the good will of Polonio. He would engage his unsuspecting
master in a discussion of clouds or wind, or
some appearance in the heavens, or something in the
leaves of the neighboring trees, and would then bring
him to the portico, that he might see the supposed
phenomenon. This would give occasion for the visitors
to get at least a glimpse of the scientist, who usually
failed to suspect the real purpose for which he had been
tempted out of doors.

While thus living in the country, Volta's piety became
a sort of proverb among the country people. Every
morning at an early hour, in company with his servant,
he could be seen with bowed head making his way to
the church. Here he heard mass, and usually the office
of the day, in which all the canons of the cathedral took
part. He had a special place on the epistle side of the
altar, not far from the organ. His favorite method of
prayer was the rosary. He was not infrequently held
up to the people by the parish priest as a model of
devotion. Whenever he was in the country, every evening
saw him taking his walk towards the church. On
these occasions, he was usually accompanied by members
of his family, and they entered the church for an
evening visit to the blessed sacrament.

His behavior toward those who lived in the vicinity
of his country place endeared him to all the peasantry.
He was not only liberal in giving alms, but
made it a point to visit frequently the houses of the
poor and help them as much as possible by counsel and
suggestion. His scientific knowledge was at command
for their benefit, and he was often able to tell them how
to avoid many dangers. He gave them definite ideas
with regard to the importance of cleanliness and the
necessity of cooking their food very carefully so as to
prevent diseases occasioned by badly cooked material.
He also taught them to distinguish between the wholesome
and the spurred rye, from which their polenta was
prepared, in order to escape the dreaded pellagra, the
disease so common in Italy, which comes from the use
of diseased grain.

He endeared himself so much to the people of the
countryside that they invented a special name for him,
which proclaimed the tenderness of their liking for
the man. They knew how much he was honored for
his wonderful discoveries in electricity, and many of
them had even seen some of the (to them at least)
inexplicable phenomena that he could produce at will by
means of various electrical contrivances. At first they
called him a "magician"; but as this word has, particularly
for the Italian peasantry, a suspicion of evil in
it, they added the adjective "beneficent," and he was
generally known as Il mago benefico.

His interest in these gentle, kindly people may be
appreciated from the fact that he knew practically all
of his country neighbors by name, and, as a rule, he
was familiar also with the conditions of their families
and their household affairs. Not infrequently he would
stop and talk to them about such things, and this favor
was always considered as a precious mark of his neighborly
courtesy by the peasantry.

Such was the simplicity of the man whose name is
undoubtedly one of the greatest in the history of science.
The great beginnings of the chapter on applied electricity
are all his. There was nothing he touched in his
work that he did not illuminate. His was typically the
mind of the genius, ever reaching out beyond the
boundaries of the known       an abundant source of leading
and light for others. Far from being a doubter in
matters religious, his scientific greatness seemed only to
make him readier to submit to what are sometimes
spoken of as the shackles of faith, though to him belief
appealed as a completion of knowledge of things beyond
the domain of sense or the ordinary powers of intellectual
acquisition. Like Pasteur, a century later, the
more he knew, the more ready was he to believe and the
more satisfying he found his faith. This is a very different
picture of the great scientific mind from that ordinarily
presented as characteristic of scientific thinkers.
But Volta is not an exception; rather does he represent
the rule, so far as the very great scientists are concerned;
for it is only the second-rate minds, those
destined to follow but not to lead, in science, who have
so constantly proclaimed the opposition of science to
faith.

Volta's well-known confession of faith declares his
state of mind with regard to religion better than any
words of a biographer, and it is a striking commentary
on the impression that has in some inexplicable way
gained wide acceptance, that a man cannot be a great
scientist and a firm believer in religion. A distinguished
professor of psychology at one of the large
American universities said not long since, that a scientist
must keep his science and religion apart, or there will be
serious consequences for his religion. Volta's opinion in
this matter is worth remembering. Having heard it said
that, though he continued to practice his religion, this
was more because he did not want to offend friends,
that he did not care to scandalize his neighbors, and did
not want the poor folk around him to be led by his example
into giving up what he knew to be their most
fruitful source of consolation in the trials of life, while
in the full exercise of his intellectual faculties, Volta
deliberately wrote out his confession of faith so that all
the world of his own and the after time might know it.

"If some of my faults and negligences may have by
chance given occasion to some one to suspect me of infidelity,
I am ready, as some reparation for this and for
any other good purpose, to declare to such a one and to
every other person and on every occasion and under all
circumstances that I have always held, and hold now,
the Holy Catholic Religion as the only true and infallible
one, thanking without end the good God for having
gifted me with such a faith, in which I firmly propose
to live and die, in the lively hope of attaining eternal life.
I recognize my faith as a gift of God, a supernatural
faith. I have not, on this account, however, neglected
to use all human means that could confirm me more and
more in it and that might drive away any doubt which
could arise to tempt me in matters of faith. I have
studied my faith with attention as to its foundations,
reading for this purpose books of apologetics as well
as those written with a contrary purpose, and trying
to appreciate the arguments pro and contra. I have
tried to realize from what sources spring the strongest
arguments which render faith most credible to natural
reason and such as cannot fail to make every well-balanced
mind which has not been perverted by vice or
passion embrace it and love it. May this protest of
mine, which I have deliberately drawn up and which I
leave to posterity, subscribed with my own hand and
which shows to all and everyone that I do not blush at
the Gospel       may it, as I have said, produce some good
fruit.       Signed at Milan, Jan. 6th, 1815, Alessandro Volta."

When Volta wrote this, he was just approaching his
sixtieth year and was in the full maturity of his powers.
He lived for twelve years after this, looked up to as one
of the great thinkers of Europe and as one of the most
important men of Italy of this time. Far from being
in his dotage, then, he was at the moment surely, if
ever, in the best position to know his own mind with
regard to his faith and his relations to the Creator.

There is a famous picture of Volta, by Magaud, in
Marseilles. It chronicles the fact that Volta had become
a Count, a Senator and a Member of the French
Institute, so appointed by Napoleon, and that he is in
some sense therefore a Frenchman. Magaud has painted
him standing, with his electric apparatus on one side
and the Scriptures on the other. Near him is placed his
friend Sylvio Pellico, whose little book, "My Ten Years'
Imprisonment," has endeared him to thousands of readers
all over the world. Pellico had doubted the presence of
Providence in the world and the existence of a hereafter.
In the midst of his doubts, he turned to Volta.
"In thy old age, O Volta!" said Pellico, "the hand
of Providence placed in thy pathway a young man gone
astray. Oh! thou, said I to the ancient seer, who hast
plunged deeper than others into the secrets of the Creator,
teach me the road that will lead me to the light."
And the old man made answer: "I too have doubted,
but I have sought. The great scandal of my youth was
to behold the teachers of those days lay hold of science
to combat religion. For me to-day I see only God everywhere."

[20] Brother Potamian has called my attention to the fact that Volta's work on the
origin of electricity from two different metals when, though connected, they were yet
separated by some moist medium, was curiously anticipated by an observation described
by Sulzer, in a book called Nouvelle Théorie des Plaisirs, 1767. In this he states
that, if a silver and a lead coin, placed one above and the other under the tongue, be
brought in contact a sour taste develops, which he considers to be due to vibrations
set up by the contact of the two metals. He seems also to have had a dash of light
before the eyes, so that all the elements necessary for the discovery of the voltaic
pile were in his hands, and indeed he was making what has since become one of the
classical experiments, by which certain physiological effects of the electric current
are demonstrated.




CHAPTER VI.
Coulomb.

Great discoverers in science must usually be satisfied
with having their names attached to some one phase of
scientific development, be it an instrument, a law, a
unit of measurement, a process of investigation or some
phenomenon which they first observed. The originality
of Coulomb's genius will be better appreciated, since
besides having a unit of electricity named after him,
there is also a law in electro-magnetics and a torsion-balance
that will always be associated with his name.
Few men have been more ingenious in their ability to
put complex ideas into practical shape and give them
simple mechanical expression by instrumental methods.
While his name is to be forever associated with the
science of electrostatics, he was profoundly interested
in other departments of physics, and for him to be
interested always meant that he would illuminate
previous knowledge by practical hints and suggestions
and carry the conclusions of his predecessors a little
farther into science than they had ever gone before.
His was typically an experimental genius, and he must be
considered one of the men of whom not more than half
a dozen are born in a century, who are, in Kipling's
strong term, "masterless"; who do not need to be
taught, but who find for themselves a path into the
domain of the unknown.

Coulomb investigated the fundamental law in electricity
and magnetism, that attractions and repulsions are
inversely as the square of the distances, and showed
that it held accurately for point-charges and point-poles.
He demonstrated that these interesting phenomena
were not chance manifestations of irregular
forces, but that they represented a definite mode of
action of force, thus setting this department of knowledge
on a scientific basis. While in practical significance
Ohm's Law, discovered nearly a half century
later, is of much more import, Coulomb's discoveries
are fundamental in character and, coming in the very
beginnings of modern electrical science, did much to
guide the infant science in the ways it should follow.
The establishing of this law contributed very largely to
the rapid development of the twin sciences of electricity
and magnetism. It is experimental observation that
means most for a rising science; and, in fact, that
Coulomb should have been the pioneer in it stamps him
as possessed not only of great originality, but also of
the power of independent thinking, which is perhaps
the most precious quality for the man of science.

The French investigator succeeded in demonstrating
his law by two distinct methods which are still used for
illustration purposes in our physical laboratories. In
the first, he employed the torsion-balance devised by
Michell, and re-invented by himself, an instrument of
exact measurement which, in his hands, yielded as invaluable
results as it did in those of Faraday half a
century later. The instrument depends on the principle
first established by Coulomb himself, that when a wire
is twisted, the angle of torsion is directly proportional
to the force of torsion. In the application of this principle,
a fine wire is suspended in a glass case, on the
sides of which there is a graduated scale to measure the
degree of repulsion between two like poles of a magnet
or between similarly electrified bodies.

In his second research on the law of the inverse
square, Coulomb used what is known as the method of
oscillations. A magnetic needle swinging under the
influence of the earth's magnetism is known to act like
a pendulum, and as such obeys the laws of pendular
motion. In applying this method, Coulomb caused the
magnetic needle to oscillate, first, under the influence
of the earth's magnetism alone and then under the combined
influence of the earth and the magnet placed at
varying distances from the needle. The most interesting
feature of this work is the manner in which Coulomb
succeeded in eliminating the important factor of the
earth's magnetism from the problem. It is so simple
and ingenious that it commands the admiration of investigators,
who employ it in their laboratory work even
to the present day.

It is clear, then, that the International Committee
which selected the term coulomb for the electromagnetic
unit of electrical quantity gave honor where
it was eminently due. Coulomb stands out as a man
of precision and accuracy, whose methods of exact
measurement revolutionized the rising science, and
whose researches and discoveries in physics and
mechanics furnish ample justification for giving him a
place among the makers of electricity. He was one of
the gifted men whose original works ushered in so
gloriously the nineteenth century, and who laid the
deep and firm foundations on which the last three
generations have built up the magnificent temple of
electrical science.

Charles Augustin de Coulomb was born at Angoulême,
June 14th, 1736. His ancestors for several generations
had been magistrates, and were looked upon as representatives
of the country nobility. He made his university
studies in Paris, and while still young, entered
the army. From the very beginning, however, his
genius for mathematics was recognized, and he was
employed in the capacity of military engineer. To
Americans, it will be interesting to know that his first
engineering project was undertaken at Martinique,
where he constructed Fort Bourbon. His sterling character
and remarkable ability secured him rapid advancement
in the service. In spite of the fact that the
climate did not agree with him, he remained for three
years on the island, because he would not employ the
political influence that might have secured his recall,
since he thought it his duty to serve his country in an
important colonial post. Nearly all his comrades perished
by fever. It is the irony of fate that after his
return to France a change in the ministry deprived him
of the just recompense of his devotion to country, and
he did not receive the special extraordinary promotion
which he had earned in this special detail.

During a short stay that he made at Paris after his
return, he sought the society of men of science as far as
possible, and succeeded in getting in touch with all that
was most promising in scientific progress at the time.
He was already known rather favorably by many of the
scientific men of the capital because of the paper on
The Statics of Vaults, a monograph on static problems
in architecture, which he presented to the Academy of
Sciences in 1779. His next military assignment was to
Rochefort. Here he composed his monograph on "The
Theory of Simple Machines," which carried off the
double prize that had been offered by the Academy of
Sciences for the solution of problems connected with
this important question. This attracted the attention
not only of the scientific world, but also of his military
superiors. As a result, he was sent successively to
Cherburg and to the Isle of Aix, to direct engineering
works, and accomplished the tasks involved with success.

Two years later, when he was about forty-five years
of age, he was elected member of the Academy of Sciences
by a unanimous vote. He was a man of great
personal magnetism, and all those who came in contact
with him learned to like him for his straightforward
character and for the absolute righteousness of his life.
Few men have made firmer friends than Coulomb, as
few have ever shown more unselfish devotion to duty
and to conscience than he, though under circumstances
that were neither spectacular nor theatrical. It was
harder to face the deadly climate of Martinique than it
would have been to take one's place at the head of a
forlorn hope in an outburst of enthusiastic courage; and
Coulomb was to have other trials of quite as deterrent
a nature, and was to meet them with the same imperturbed
sense of duty.

Graft is sometimes supposed to be temptation peculiar
only to our own times, but the opportunities for it have
always been present in such work as Coulomb had to
oversee, and the army engineer of all ages has had to
stand or fall before it. It was proposed, about this
time, to build a system of government canals in Brittany.
Such a canal-system would, as is easy to understand,
cost an enormous sum of money and give magnificent
opportunities for speculation of various kinds.
No small objection had been made to the project, on the
score that it would not confer all the benefits on the
region that were claimed for it, and Coulomb was commissioned
by the Minister of Marine to determine the
question of the advisability of constructing the canals,
and of the probable effect which they would have on the
commerce of the country.

After careful investigation, he came to the conclusion
that the advantages which were expected to accrue
from the project would not compensate for the enormous
expense that would be entailed. This decision
aroused the angry protest of a strong political faction,
who expected to reap wealth and personal advantages
of many kinds from the scheme, and who protested bitterly
against Coulomb's report. He was able to support
his conclusions in the matter, however, with such unanswerable
mathematical and engineering arguments,
that his opinion prevailed and the project was given up.

As a consequence, instead of the opportunity to serve
a political party with every avenue to preferment and,
above all, to wealth open for him, he found himself, for
the time being, deprived even of the opportunity to
devote himself further to his favorite occupations in
military engineering. The excuse given for this interruption
in his career, for there has always been an
excuse for such action, was that proper representations
for permission to make the report had not been made to
the Minister of Marine; and instead of commendation,
Coulomb received what was practically a reprimand.

Wounded by this injustice, which was manifestly due
to the fact that his honest report had displeased those
who expected to reap personal benefit from the canal
project, and disgusted with a service in which such
things were possible, Coulomb sent in his resignation.
The Minister of Marine realized that the acceptance
of the proffered resignation would surely expose the
ministry at least to suspicion as to the reasons why
Coulomb's report was not accepted with good grace.
Permission to retire from the service was refused, as
this would insure his silence. He was ordered back to
Brittany to continue his work there, possibly with the
idea that this unfavorable experience would be sufficient
of itself to make him understand what was expected of
him and render him a little more complacent to the
wishes of those in authority. If any such ideas were
entertained, they were destined to grievous disappointment.
Coulomb was not of those who, seeing duty
plainly, refuse to follow it because some personal advantage
or disadvantage intervenes. Selfish reasons
did not appeal to his character nor obscure the issues.

He went back to Brittany, ready to express his firm
opinion in the matter and with integrity of soul untouched.
The consequence was that the provincial
authorities, recognizing their true interests, acknowledged
the error they had come near falling into, and
now wished to reward the engineer handsomely for his
unswerving devotion to duty. Coulomb as promptly
refused a reward for doing his duty as he had ignored
even the appearance of a bribe to avoid it. Only after
considerable pressure was he prevailed upon to accept
the best timepiece they could procure, on which the
arms of the province were engraved. It had what was
quite rare in those days, a second's hand, and he constantly
made use of this in all his experimental work
thereafter. A French biographer says that, never was
a souvenir better chosen nor more suitably employed.
Coulomb's merits were recognized by the government
authorities not long after, and he was made superintendent
of the fountains of France. A few years later,
he was promoted to the position of Curator of Plans
and Relief Maps of the Military Staff of France, and
was chosen as one of the commission of the French
Academy of Sciences who went to England in order to
study hospital conditions there. At this time, he was
at the acme of his career. His grade was that of Lieutenant
Colonel of Engineers, a position much higher in
the foreign armies at that time than would be the post
with the corresponding title in our army. He had been
made a Chevalier of St. Louis, and it looked as though
a brilliant future were opening out before him. Each
year, for a decade, had seen the publication of one or
more memoirs on important subjects, nearly every one
of which contained some original material of the highest
value, destined not only to add to Coulomb's reputation,
but to furnish basic information for the further development
of science.

In 1789, however, the Revolution broke out, and there
was an end to all Coulomb's opportunities for work. He
was utterly out of sympathy with the movement, the
worst consequences of which he foresaw from the beginning,
and he at once handed in his resignation of the
various positions that he occupied under the government.
He went into almost absolute retirement, devoting himself
to the education of his children. During this time,
however, he did not cease to cultivate science, inasmuch
as he gave the finishing touch to various papers which
he had previously outlined. Unfortunately, however, his
departure from Paris made it impossible for him to
continue his investigations in electricity for want of apparatus,
and so there is a ten years' interruption in his
life of scientific activity and of original work. Besides,
it cannot be surprising that he should not have had the
heart to go on with his work under the awful social
conditions that prevailed. Many of his friends lost their
lives during the stormy period of the Revolution; most
of the others were banished or were in hiding. His beloved
country had gone into an unfortunate eclipse, as
he could not help but consider it; most of the nations
of the earth were indeed in league against her, and the
end was not yet in sight. It would be too much to expect
of human nature that it should devote itself to
abstruse problems in science at moments of such disturbance
as this, and so some of the possibilities of
Coulomb's original genius were lost to science during
that calamitous period.

Like many of the great discoveries of science, Coulomb's
most important work was done in the course of
other investigations, and came by what might be called
a happy accident. He had been investigating the qualities
of wire of various kinds, especially with regard to
their elasticity, so as to be able to determine the limits
of their use in various engineering projects. When he
discovered that the elasticity of torsion of a wire was a
constant property, he proceeded to utilize it in the calculation
of such delicate phenomena as those of electric
and magnetic forces. The first instrument for this
purpose that he constructed consisted simply of a long
magnetized needle suspended horizontally by a fine
wire. Supposing this needle to be at rest, if one moves
it away from the magnetic meridian by a certain number
of degrees, the twisted wire will have a definite
tendency to untwist and to bring back the needle to its
original position by a series of oscillations whose frequency
can be readily observed.

For such observations, it is possible to obtain the value
of the force acting on the needle and causing it to move
to and fro at a given rate. This was the underlying
idea which received very simple expression in the ingenious
instrument which Coulomb devised and called a
torsion-balance. With it, he set about determining the
law which governs the mutual action of magnets and
of electrified bodies with regard to distance, and found it
to be the same as that which Newton found to hold for
bodies distributed throughout the universe, that is, that
attraction and repulsion vary inversely as the square of
the distance. He also proved, with the aid of his torsion-balance,
that the forces of attraction and repulsion
vary as the product of the strength of the poles in one
case and as the product of the electric charges in the
other. These were the important discoveries of Coulomb's
life; they served to earn for him the right to
have his name given to the unit of electrical quantity,
the coulomb.

Coulomb did not stop here, however, but proceeded to
apply his laws to various other phenomena. He proved
that electricity distributes itself entirely over the surface
of a body without penetrating the mass of the conductor,
and he showed by calculation that this result
was a necessary consequence of the law of repulsion.

A list of the papers which he published on electricity
and magnetism, the titles of which, with French accuracy
of expression, furnish an excellent idea of their contents,
shows the thoroughly progressive and scientific
spirit of the man, and how well he proceeded from the
known to the less known, always widening the bounds
of knowledge. Suffice it to say here that the observations
of Coulomb were not only original, but that they
concerned some of the most difficult questions in electricity,
and that he was clearing the ground for others
in such a way as to make future work and quantitative
measurements in electricity reliable and comparatively
easy. It is because of this pioneer work that Coulomb
deserves so much praise. It was not long before Coulomb's
observations were confirmed by others, and then
the beginnings of the modern development of electricity
became manifest, owing not a little to the
researches and inventions, the genius and ingenuity of
this French military engineer.

Some phases of electrical development attributed to
others really belong to Coulomb. A typical example of
this detraction from his merit is the attribution to Biot
of the solution of the problem of the complete discharge
of an electrified sphere by means of two hollow hemispheres.
This experiment is fully described by Coulomb,
and he even emphasizes the fact that the external
discharging bodies need not necessarily be of the
same shape as the charged sphere. Some of what
Coulomb accepted as principles in electricity have proved
in the course of time, not to be the realities that he
thought them; but the progress that has led to such
contradictions of his opinions has been mainly rendered
possible by his own discoveries. The fable of the eagle
stricken by the arrow containing some of its own feathers,
is so old that one might think that, when the
progress of a science due to a scientist brings men beyond
the position he occupied, they would not blame him
for backwardness. This is, however, one of the curious
critical methods in the history of science that has most
frequently to be deprecated by the historian who is
tracing origins and developments.

Coulomb's papers, with the exception of his memoir
on "Problems in Statics Applied to Architecture," his
"Researches on the Methods of executing Works under
Water without the Necessity of Pumping," his "Theory
of Simple Machines," and his researches "On Windmills,"
which form separate monographs, were all published
together in a single volume by the French Physical
Society in 1884.[21]

This volume contains, besides his investigations on
the best way of making magnetic needles, his theoretic
and experimental investigations on the force of torsion
and on the elasticity of metallic threads, which were
undertaken in order to enable him to make his electric
torsion-balance something more than mere guess-work.
All the other papers are concerned directly with electricity
or magnetism, and show how actively, nearly a
hundred and twenty-five years ago, a great mind was
engaged with problems in electricity which we are apt
to consider as belonging more properly to our own time.
The list of papers published in these memoirs, arranged
in chronological order, gives a good idea of the development
of electrical science in Coulomb's own mind.
There is a logical as well as a chronological order to be
observed in them.

In 1785, when he was just approaching his fiftieth
year, there were three subjects with regard to which
Coulomb's experimental observations enabled him to set
down some definite principles. The first of these was
the construction and use of an electric balance, founded
on the property which wires have of exhibiting a torque
proportional to the angle of torsion. The second was
the determination of the laws, according to which the
magnetic and electric "fluids," as Coulomb and investigators
in electricity called them at that time, act both
as regards repulsion and attraction. The third was the
determination of the quantity of electricity which an
insulated body loses in a given time from contact with
air more or less moist.

In 1786, he published a paper in which he demonstrated
what he considered the principal properties of
the electric fluid. These are, that this fluid does not
spread itself on a substance by any chemical affinity
or any elective attraction, but that it distributes itself
over various bodies that are placed in contact, entirely
in accordance with their shape; and also that in electrical
conductors, the charge is limited to the surface of
the conductor and does not penetrate to any appreciable
depth.

In 1787, his only paper was on the manner in which
the electrical fluid divides itself between two conducting
bodies placed in contact, and on the distribution of this
fluid over the different parts of the surface of these
bodies. He continued his investigations into this subject
in 1788, and also succeeded in determining the
density of the electricity at different points on the surface
of conducting bodies.

In 1789, he began to work more particularly on magnetism.
His first paper on the subject was published
that year. Unfortunately, as we have said, the Revolution
interrupted his scientific investigations at this
point, and for the next eleven years we have nothing
from his pen. As a nobleman, he was compelled to
leave Paris, and this not only put him out of touch with
scientific work generally, but deprived him of the opportunities
of using such apparatus as was necessary to
carry on his experiments. That he acted prudently in
leaving Paris, the careers of other scientists amply
prove. Lavoisier continued to carry on his chemical
investigations during the stormy times of the Revolution,
but his stay in the capital eventually cost him his life.
Abbé Haüy, the father of crystallography,[22] who, because
of his contributions to the science of pyro-electricity, is of
special interest to us, continued to work at his crystals
throughout even the Reign of Terror. When thrown into
prison, he asked and obtained permission to have his
crystals with him. His friends saved him from Lavoisier's
fate, but not without an effort, as his life was
seriously endangered.

It is easy to understand, however, that a member of
the nobility like Coulomb, whose life had been spent in
military affairs, should not be able to devote himself
seriously to scientific matters while his country was in
such a turmoil.

In 1801, he resumed his investigations once more, but
now they are concerned more particularly with magnetism.
The first was a theoretical and practical determination
of the forces which hold different magnetic
needles, magnetized to saturation, in the magnetic
meridian. This was followed, in the same year, by a
paper which, like its predecessor, was published among
the memoirs of the Institute of France, which had replaced
the Royal Academy of Sciences, to which body
many of Coulomb's papers of the former time had been
presented, and in whose publications they originally
appeared. This second paper detailed his experiments
on the determination of the force of cohesion of fluids
and the law of resistance in them, when the movements
were very slow.

When the French Institute was organized under
Napoleon in 1801, Coulomb was named among its first
members. It is believed that he was even chosen to
occupy a place in the first government of the state, but
a man more interested in politics obtained the place,
a fortunate circumstance for science. Coulomb was
named, however, one of the inspectors of public instruction,
then the highest place in the education department,
and he did much to restore to France the educational
system that had been destroyed during the Revolution.
In this rather trying work he was noted for the kindliness
yet firmness of his character, while his absolute
fairness and sense of justice were recognized on all
sides.

Unfortunately Coulomb was not long spared to continue
his work. He took up his experimental and
mathematical investigations, on his return to the capital,
with great enthusiasm, but his health had been undermined
and his work had been rudely interrupted. After
1801, no further paper by him appears to have been published
until 1806. This gave the result of different
methods employed in order to produce in blades and
bars of steel the greatest degree of magnetism. For
some time preceding this, in spite of increasing ill-health,
he had continued his experiments on the influence
of temperature on the magnetism of steel.
His work on this subject was not destined to be completed,
for not long after passing his seventieth year,
in June of this year, his health gave way completely,
and he died August 23d, 1806. His final observations
were gathered by Biot, carefully preserved, and assigned
a place in the volume of Coulomb's Memoirs, issued by
the French Physical Society.

Personally, Coulomb was noted for great seriousness
of character, though with this was mingled a gentleness
of disposition that made for him some cordial friendships
among his scientific contemporaries. He had but
few friends, but those who were admitted to his intimacy
made up by the depth of their affection for the
smallness of their number. Even those who had occasion
to meet him but once or twice, carried away from
their meeting an affectionate remembrance of his kindliness
and courtesy and readiness to help wherever he
could be of service. He was extremely happy in his
family relations, and this proved to be a great source of
consolation to him during the years when the progress
of the French Revolution took him away from science
and made him almost despair of his country.

It is not surprising that Biot, the great French physicist,
in writing of Coulomb in his Mélanges Scientifiques
et Littéraires, Vol. III. (Paris, 1858), should have held
Coulomb up as a model of the simple, earnest, helpful
life and as a man of the most exemplary character. He
says: "Coulomb lived among the men of his time in
patience and charity. He was distinguished among
them mainly by his separation from their passions and
their errors, and he always maintained himself calm,
firm and dignified in se totus teres atque rotundus, as
Horace says, a complete, perfect and well-rounded character."
Few men have deserved so noble a eulogy as
this, written nearly fifty years after his death, by one
who had known Coulomb himself and his contemporaries
well; it has none of the exaggeration of a funeral panegyric,
and is evidently founded on details of knowledge
with regard to the great electrician which had become a
tradition among French scientists, and which Biot has
forever crystallized into the history of science by his
emphatic expression.

One could scarcely wish for a better epitaph than
Biot's summing up of Coulomb's personal character:
"All those who knew Coulomb know how the gravity
of his character was tempered by the sweetness of his
disposition, and those who had the happiness to meet
him at their entrance into a scientific career have kept
the most tender remembrance of his gentle good-heartedness."

CHAPTER VII.
Hans Christian Oersted.



Hans Christian Oersted


Whatever may be thought of the value of controversy
in other departments of knowledge, it has certainly
proved useful in the progress of experimental science.
Witness the animated and prolonged discussion which
took place between Volta and Galvani, and which led to
enduring results for the welfare of mankind. Wishing
to prove the correctness of his theory of electrification
by contact against Galvani's animal electricity, Volta
devoted himself unremittingly to experimentation until,
in the century year 1800, his brilliant work culminated
in the invention of the "pile" or electric battery which
bears his name.

A suspicion had been growing for many years in the
minds of physicists, that there must be some degree of
relationship, probably an intimate one, between magnetism
and electricity, between magnetic and electric
forces. In the year 1785, van Swinden, a celebrated
Dutch physicist, published a work on electricity in
which he described and commented upon a number of
analogies which he had observed between the two
orders of phenomena; but, voluminous as was the work,
it threw no light on the nature of the suspected relationship.

It was well known, in the case of houses and ships
struck by lightning, that knives, forks and other articles
made of steel were often found to be permanently magnetized.
Following up this pregnant observation, experimenters
often sought to impart magnetic properties
to steel needles by Leyden-jar discharges, but with
indifferent success. Sometimes there would be a trace
of magnetism left and sometimes none. In no case was
it possible to say beforehand which end of the knitting-needle
would have north polarity and which south.

Though we are better equipped to-day for research
work than were our predecessors in the electrical field
fifty years ago, we are still unable to predict the polarity
that will result in a bar of iron from a given condenser
discharge. The uncertainty arises from the fact
disclosed by Joseph Henry in 1842 and well known
to-day that, under ordinary circumstances, all such discharges
consist of a rush of electricity to and fro, that
is, they give rise to an oscillatory current of exceedingly
short duration. Were it otherwise, that is, were the
discharge unidirectional, the needle would always be
magnetized to a degree of intensity proportional to the
energy released; and it would be possible in every case
to foretell with certainty the resulting polarity which
the needle would acquire.

With the advent of the voltaic battery, a generator
which supplies a steady flow of current in one direction,
the interesting problem of relationship between electric
and magnetic forces was again attacked; and this time
with considerable success.

Probably the earliest investigator afield was Romagnosi,
an Italian physician residing in Trent (Tyrol),
who, in the year 1802, published in the "Gazetta" of
his town an account of an experiment which he had
made, and which showed that he was working on promising
lines. What he did was this: having connected
one end of a silver chain to a voltaic pile, and having
carried the chain through a glass tube for the purpose
of insulation, he presented the free end, terminating in
a knob, to a compass-needle, also insulated. At first,
the needle was attracted; and, after contact, repelled.
Whatever Romagnosi thought of his experiment and its
theoretical bearing, the attraction and subsequent repulsion
of the compass-needle which he said he observed
were electrostatic and not electromagnetic effects. The
Italian physician was indeed on the verge of a great
discovery; but he halted in his course and lost his
opportunity.

Mojon, Professor of chemistry in Genoa, was a little
more fortunate, though he, too, failed to improve his
opportunities. In 1804, he sought to magnetize steel
needles by placing them for a period of twenty days in
circuit with a battery of one hundred elements of the
crown-of-cups type, and had the satisfaction of finding
them permanently magnetized when withdrawn from
the circuit. Unlike the electrostatic effect of his fellow-countryman
Romagnosi, this was unquestionably an
electromagnetic effect, the first link in the long chain
connecting electricity with magnetism.

That this result attracted wide attention at the time,
as it well deserved, is evident from the notice given by
Izarn in his "Manuel du Galvanisme," and by Aldini
in his "Essai Théorique et expérimental sur le Galvanisme,"
both of which were published in Paris in the
same year, 1804.

Though the manuals of Izarn and Aldini served to
give a fresh impetus to the quest of the relationship between
electricity and magnetism, it was not, however,
until the year 1820 that the cardinal discovery was made
by one philosopher and the intimate relationship revealed
by another. Then all Europe rang with the
names of Oersted, the fortunate discoverer of the
"magnetic effect" of the electric current, and Ampère,
whose masterly analysis disclosed the nature of the
long-sought-for connection. In the delight of the hour,
men called Oersted the Columbus, and Ampère the Newton,
of electricity.

Though a philosopher of a high order and lecturer of
interest and brilliancy, Oersted was, nevertheless, a poor
experimentalist. He was fine in the abstract, awkward
in the concrete. Often did he call for the assistance of
a student to perform an experiment for the class under
his direction. Hansteen, who is celebrated for his very
fine work in terrestrial magnetism, often had this privilege,
for he was clear of mind and deft of hand. Writing
to Faraday, he said: "Oersted was a man of genious,
but very unsuccessful as a demonstrator, for he
could not manipulate instruments."

In seeking for some evidence of a physical interaction
between electricity and magnetism, Oersted on one occasion,
placed a wire conveying a current vertically across
a compass-needle; and, on obtaining no result, seemed
greatly disappointed. He evidently expected the needle
to respond in some way to the energy of the current;
and so it would have responded had he placed the wire
in any other position than the particular one which he
selected. The Danish philosopher now hesitates; and
for lack of coolness, patience and resourcefulness, runs
the risk of losing the crowning glory of his life. He is
disappointed at his failure; and for the nonce, contents
himself with brooding over it.



Fig. 22
The Magnetic Effect of an Electric Current. Oersted, 1820


On another occasion, having a stronger battery at his
disposal, he determined to try the experiment again,
in the hope that the greater energy at his command
would provoke
the magnet to
respond. This
time, he stretched
the wire
over and parallel
to the
compass needle,
when, to
his intense delight, the magnet turned aside as soon
as the circuit was closed. The result was pronounced
and instantaneous. The Professor, an enthusiast by
nature, waxed warm over his good fortune, and well
might he do so, as the discovery which he had just
made was destined to revolutionize existing modes
of transmitting intelligence to distant parts and bring
remotest countries into direct, and immediate relation
with one another.

That Oersted fell into ecstasy over his success was
but natural, though it is not stated that he exhibited his
enthusiasm by the performance of any unusual feat.
When Lavoisier made a discovery, he was wont to take
hold of his assistant and go dancing around with him
for sheer joy. After making a certain successful experiment
in his laboratory, Gay-Lussac gave vent to his
feelings by dancing round the room, and clapping his
hands the while. It is related that, when Davy saw the
first globules of potassium burst through the crust of
potash and take fire, his delight knew no bounds. He
also took to dancing, and some time had to elapse before
he was sufficiently composed to continue his work. Even
the cool and self-possessed Faraday occasionally waxed
warm on seeing his efforts crowned with success. It is
said that, when he got a wire conveying a current to revolve
round the pole of a magnet, he rubbed his hands
vigorously and danced around the table, his face beaming
with delight: "There they go, there they go; we have
succeeded at last," he said. He then gleefully proposed
to cease work for the day and spend the evening at
Astley's seeing the feats of well-trained horses!

Having realized that his experiment was one of fundamental
importance in physical theory, our philosopher
proceeds to repeat it under varying conditions. He
places the wire conveying the current in front of the
needle, behind it, under it, across it; he reverses the
current in each case, and notices the direction in which
the needle turns. Though he states results very clearly,
he gives no general rule whereby the direction of the
deflection may be foretold from that of the current. A
memoria technica to meet all cases that may occur was
needed, and was promptly supplied by Ampère, who,
with a flash of genius, devised the rule of the little swimmer.
Others have been added since, such as the cork-screw
rule and the rule involving the outspread right
hand; but the swimmer appeals in a manner quite its
own to the fancy of the youthful student. It pleases
while it instructs; it is ingenious while yet remarkably
simple.

It has been said that the Philosopher of Copenhagen
was led by mere accident to the experiment which will
hand his name down the ages; but inasmuch as he was
looking, during thirteen years, for a result analogous to
the one which he obtained, it is only right to give him
full credit for the success which he achieved. It has
been well remarked, that the seeds of great discoveries
are constantly floating around us, but take root only in
minds well prepared to receive them. Accidents of the
Oersted type happen only to men who deserve them, as
was the case with Musschenbroek and Galvani in the
eighteenth century, and with Roentgen in the nineteenth.
The electrification of a flask of water, the twitching
of frogs' legs in response to electric sparks, and the
blackening of a sensitive screen by a distant, shielded
Crookes's tube, led to the electrostatic condenser in the
first case, to "galvanism" in the second, and to the
photography of the invisible in the third.

Writing of Oersted's discovery, Faraday said that
"It burst open the gates of a domain in science, dark
till then, and filled it with a flood of light."

The discovery of 1820 was hailed throughout Europe by
an extraordinary outburst of enthusiasm. Oersted was
complimented and congratulated on all sides. Honors
were showered upon him: the Royal Society of London
awarded him the Copley medal; the French Academy
of Sciences gave him its gold medal for the physico-mathematical
sciences; Prussia conferred upon him the
Ordre pour le Mérite, and his own country made him a
Knight of the Daneborg.

Oersted lost no time in preparing a memoir on the
subject of his work, a copy of which was sent to the
learned societies and most renowned philosophers of
Europe. The memoir, which was written in Latin and
dated July 21st, 1820, consisted of four quarto pages with
the title "Experiments on the effect of the electric conflict
on the magnetic needle."

A perusal of this paper brings home the conviction
that Oersted realized fairly well the forces which came
into play in his experiment; for in one place, he speaks
of the effect as due to a transverse force emanating
from the conductor
conveying the current,
and again as
a conflict acting in
a revolving manner
around the wire. A
complete statement
of the nature of the
mechanical force exerted
by a conductor
conveying a current on a magnetic needle was given
almost immediately by Ampère, a master analyst and
accomplished experimentalist.



Fig. 23
Magnetic Field Surrounding a Conductor Carrying a Current


It will stand for all time in the history of science,
that in less than two months after the publication of
Oersted's memoir, Ampère succeeded in showing the
mechanical effect in magnitude and direction of an element
of current not only on the magnetic needle itself,
but also on a similar element of an adjacent conductor
conveying a current, thereby founding a new science in
the department of physics, the science of electro-dynamics.

Oersted does not appear to have given thought to the
practical possibilities of his discovery. While appreciating
the utilitarian in science, he evidently preferred the
pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. In a discourse
which he delivered in 1814 before the University of
Copenhagen, he put himself on record when he said
that "The real laborer in the scientific field chooses
knowledge as his highest aim."

So said Plato ages before, and so said Archimedes,
who held that it was undesirable for a philosopher to
seek to apply the discoveries of science to any practical
end. The screw which he invented, his
catapults and burning mirrors, show, however,
that when necessary the Syracusan
mathematician could come down from the
serene heights of investigation to the prosaic
arena of application.

Before Oersted spoke of "the real laborer,"
Thomas Young had affirmed that
"Those who possess the genuine spirit of
scientific investigation are content to proceed
in their researches without inquiring
at every step what they gain by their newly
discovered lights, and to what practical purposes
they are applicable."



Fig. 24
Magnetic Whirl Surroundinga Wire Through Which a Current is Passing


Young's most illustrious successor in the
Royal Institution, Michael Faraday, devoted
himself calmly but unflinchingly to research
work, in the conviction that no discovery,
however remote in its nature, from the subject
of daily observation, could with reason
be declared wholly inapplicable to the benefit
of mankind. After discovering in 1831 that electric
currents could be produced by the relative motion
of magnets and coils of wire, a discovery which is the
basis of all the electric engineering of our day, Faraday
constructed several experimental machines embodying
this principle, and then turned away abruptly from
the work, saying, "I had rather been desirous of
discovering new facts and new relations dependent on
magneto-electric induction than of exalting the force
of those already obtained, being assured that the latter
would find their full development hereafter."

Our own Joseph Henry, whose sterling merit is
universally recognized, beautifully said in this connection:
"He who loves truth for its own sake feels that
its highest claims are lowered by being continually
summoned to the bar of immediate and palpable utility."

Oersted seems to have shared the opinion largely held
by the scientific men of his day, that electricity is
mainly a magnetic phenomenon. Ampère, for one, did
not think so, as is evident from the beautiful theory
which he devised to explain the magnetism of a bar by
minute electric currents flowing round each individual
molecule of the iron. To the French physicist, magnetism
was purely an electrical phenomenon.



Fig. 25
Ampère's Molecular Currents


Though propounded
more than eighty years
ago, this theory is still in
harmony with all facts
and phenomena in the domain
of magnetism known
to-day. It is important to
remember, when thinking
of this physical theory,
that the Amperian currents in question are confined
to the molecule, and that they do not flow from one
molecule to another. Critics have urged against the
theory that the molecules must be heated by the
circulation of these elementary currents, to which
objection it has been replied that, as we know nothing
of the nature of the molecule, we cannot say that it
offers any resistance to the current; and, therefore, we
cannot affirm that there is any development of heat
due to the circulation of these elementary currents.

It is to Ampère's credit that he was also the first to
propose a practical application of Oersted's discovery,
an application that was nothing less than the electric
telegraph itself. He suggested that the deflection of
the magnetic needle could be used for the transmission
of signals from one place to another by means of as
many needles and circuits as there are letters in the
alphabet. If Ampère had only recalled the optical and
mechanical telegraphs in use in his day, such as the
swinging of lanterns by night and wigwagging of flags
and the movements of semaphores by day, he might
have reduced his twenty-four circuits to one, using the
two elements, viz., motion of the needle to the right and
motion to the left, to make up the entire alphabet.
Morse substituted the dot and the dash for these deflections,
and thus rendered the reception of messages
automatic and permanent.

In connection with this proposal to use a magnetic
needle for the transmission of intelligence, the reader
will no doubt recall the lover's telegraph, so beautifully
described by Addison in the "Spectator" for December
6th, 1711; but ingeniously conceived as it was, this
magnetic telegraph was purely and simply a creation of
the imagination.

This canny conceit has been attributed to Cardinal
Bembo, the elegant scholar and private secretary to
Pope Leo X.; but it was his friend Porta, the versatile
philosopher, who made it widely known by the vivid
description which he gave of it in his celebrated
work on "Natural Magic," published at Naples in 1558.

This sympathetic telegraph consisted, we are told,
of a magnetic needle poised in the center of a dial-plate,
with the letters of the alphabet written around
it. The two fortunate individuals privileged to hold
wireless correspondence with each other having agreed
as to the day and the hour, proceed to the room in
which the wonderful instrument is kept, where, as soon
as one of them turns the needle of his transmitter
to a letter, the distant needle turns at once in sympathy
to the same letter on its dial!

Such is the power of magnetic sympathy, that the instruments
will work successfully though hills, forests,
lakes or mountains intervene! Porta has it: "To a
friend at a distance shut up in prison, we may relate
our minds; which, I do not doubt, may be done by
means of compasses having the alphabet written around
them."



Fig. 26
The "Sympathetic Telegraph" from Cabeo's Pilosophia Magnetica, 1629


This sympathetic magnetic telegraph figures extensively
in the scientific literature of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries: some believed in the figment,
others condemned it. Addison described it in elegant
prose, and Akenside in beautiful verse. Perhaps the
most famous composition
on the subject is a short
Latin poem, written, after
the style and vein of Lucretius,
in 1617 by Famianus
Strada, an Italian
Jesuit. A few years after
its publication in the
author's "Prolusiones," a
metrical translation was
made by Hakewill and inserted
on page 285 of
his "Apologie, or Declaration
of the Power and Providence of God," 1630.

Owing to the interest that attaches to this celebrated
composition and the difficulty of getting Hakewill's
"Apologie," we append his version of the poem.


The Loade above all other stones hath this strange property
If sundry steels thereto or needles you apply,
Such force and motion thence they draw that they
incline
To turn them to the Bear, which near the Pole doth shine.
Nay, more, as many steels as touch that virtuous stone
In strange and wondrous sort conspiring all in one
Together move themselves and situate together:
As if one of those steels at Rome be stirred, the other
The self-same way will stir though they far distant be,
And all through Nature's force and secret sympathy;
Well then if you of aught would fain advise your friend
That dwells far off, to whom no letter you can send;
A large smooth round table make, write down the
crisscross row
In order on the verge thereof, and then bestow
The needle in the midst which touch'd the Loade that so
What note soe'er you list, it straight may turn unto.
Then frame another orb in all respects like this
Describe the edge and lay the steel thereon likewise,
The steel which from the self-same Magnes motion drew;
This orb send with thy friend what time he bids adieu.
But on the days agree at first, when you do mean to
prove
If the steel stir, and to what letter it doth move.
This done, if with thy friend thou closely wouldst
advise,
Who in a country off far distant from thee lies,
Take thou the orb and steel which on the orb was set
The crisscross on the edge thou seest in order writ.
What notes will frame thy words, to them direct thy
steel
And it sometimes to this, sometimes to that note wheel
Turning it round about so often till you find
You have compounded all the meaning of your mind.
Thy friend that dwells far off, O strange! doth plainly
see
The steel so stir though it by no man stirréd be,
Running now here, now there: he conscious of the plot
As the steel-guide pursues, and reads from note to note.
Then gathering into words those notes, he clearly sees
What's needful to be done, the needle truchman is.
Now, when the steel doth cease its motion; if thy friend
Think it convenient answer back to send,
The same course he may take; and, with his needle
write
Touching the several notes which so he list indite.
Would God, men would be pleased to put this course in
use,
Their letters would arrive more speedy and more sure,
No rivers would them stop nor thieves them intercept;
Princes with their own hands, their business might effect.
We scribes, from black sea 'scaped, at length with hearty
wills
At th' altar of the Loade would consecrate our quills.


Another translation of the poem was made by Dr.
Samuel Ward and published at the end of his "Wonders
of the Loadstone," 1640.



Fig. 27
The "Sympathetic Telegraph" from Turner's Ars Notoria, 1657


Ampère's suggestion,
made, as we have seen,
in the year 1820, was not
the first proposal to use
electricity for telegraphic
purposes. Already, in
1753, a writer in The Scots
Magazine, signing himself
C. M. (Charles Morrison,
of Greenock, according
to Sir David Brewster,
and Charles Marshall, of
Paisley, according to Latimer
Clark), outlined a method involving the use of frictional
electricity; and Lesage, of Geneva, constructed a
short experimental line, in 1774, consisting of twenty-four
wires and a pith-ball electroscope. But the man who
attained the greatest success in the employment of static
electricity for this purpose was Ronalds, of London, who,
in 1816, erected a single-wire line eight miles long in his
gardens at Hammersmith, with a pair of pith-balls and
a rotating disc for receiving instrument.

When well satisfied that his system was practicable
and reliable, Ronalds wrote to the head of the intelligence
department in London urging the adoption of
his invention for the public service; but he was
promptly brought to realize the scant encouragement so
often extended to inventors by persons in high places,
that responsible official politely informing him "that
telegraphs of all kinds are wholly unnecessary," and that
no other than the mechanical one in daily use would be
adopted.

When penning these words, the representative of the
British government must have forgotten the experience
of 1812, when the result of the battle of Salamanca was
semaphored from Plymouth to London, on which occasion
a fog cut off the message after the transmission of
the first two words, "Wellington defeated," the remainder
of the despatch, "the French at Salamanca,"
reaching the capital only on the following morning!

A rapid sketch of the life of our philosopher, whose
discovery of the magnetic effect of the voltaic current in
1820 led to the invention of the electric telegraph, cannot
be without interest.

Hans Christian Oersted was born on August 14th, 1777,
in the little town of Rudkjöbing, in the island of Langeland,
Denmark. Being the son of poor parents, his
early years were spent in very narrow circumstances.
He and his younger brother were mainly indebted
to their own efforts for whatever instruction they
received in the rudiments of learning. The town in
which they lived being small, offered few opportunities
for education, even if the family exchequer had been
such as to permit the boys to take advantage of them.
There was a German wigmaker in the place, however,
who was a little more advanced in knowledge than the
generality of the townspeople. He and his wife liked
the Oersted boys, who were very frequently to be found
in the wigmaker's shop. The good housewife taught
them to read, while the artist himself taught them a
little German. Hans Christian advanced so rapidly in
his studies that he acquired a reputation for precociousness,
which, with the usual prejudice against bright
children, made the neighbors shake their heads prophetically
and say: "The child will not live; he is too
bright to last long."

Hans Christian learned the elements of arithmetic
from an old school-book which he picked up by chance;
and no sooner had he advanced a little, than he set
about instructing his brother. Very probably, the teacher
benefited quite as much by this process of instruction
as the pupil. Adversity is a good school for the formation
of character as well as for the acquisition of
knowledge. It is evident, from the lives of such men
as Oersted, Faraday, Kepler, Ohm, and others who were
brought up in the lap of poverty, that it is not so much
educational opportunity that is needed for the development
of mind which we call education, as the earnest
determination and the abiding desire to have it. Even
boyhood creates its own opportunities for education
despite intervening obstacles, if it has only a decided
eagerness, a pronounced thirst for knowledge.

About the time that the young Oersteds entered their
teens, their father secured the services of a private
teacher to give them some instruction in the rudiments
of Latin and Greek. This accidental preceptor
was only a wandering student who happened to be
in the place at the time; but the boys, in their eagerness
to learn, derived more benefit from his lessons
than many boys of their age often do nowadays from
the help and encouragement of a carefully selected and
academically equipped tutor.

At the age of twelve, Oersted senior was taken into
his father's apothecary-shop in quality of assistant, a
position which seemed destined to put an end to all
opportunities for further advancement in the path of
learning. When a boy goes into a drug-store in an
official capacity, his future career is usually settled; he
is a druggist to the end. His new avocation, however,
proved to be the beginning of new intellectual activities
for Oersted. The chemical side of his work became a
source of new information to him, and also a stimulus to
learn all that he could of chemistry and kindred subjects.
Science became a hobby with the young apothecary,
and everything relating to it appealed to him.
What Hans learned, he as usual imparted to his brother,
who was already becoming interested in other departments
of learning, especially the law.

The desire of the boys to advance grew with their
stock of knowledge. Accordingly, when, in 1794, Hans
was only seventeen years of age and his brother sixteen,
they both matriculated at the University of Copenhagen.
Their father was able to help them but little, so that
they were obliged to live quietly and sparingly, a condition
distinctly favorable to consecutive and efficient
study. They became so successful in their pursuits that
they soon began to attract attention. Having passed
creditable examinations, they were recommended for
pecuniary assistance from an educational fund established
by the government for the purpose. Even then,
as receipts were hardly equal to expenses, they sought
to increase their little revenue by giving private lessons
in their leisure hours. Here we have a striking example
of what may be accomplished by men who work
their way through College in the teeth of adverse circumstances;
in these two brothers, we have proof of the
truth that it is the student's mind, his willingness and
determination to work, that count in education more
than the golden opportunities that may fall to his lot.

In the year 1799, Oersted prepared a thesis on "The
Architectonics of Natural Metaphysics," which won
for him his Doctorate in Philosophy. Though the young
Doctor did not hesitate to discuss metaphysical problems
and even to disagree with Kant at a time when most
Teutonic minds were deeply under the influence of the
philosopher of Königsberg, his chief interests, however,
centered in the experimental sciences, in physics and
chemistry.

In spite of his devotedness to science, Oersted allowed
himself, by way of distraction, an occasional excursion
into the field of literature. A great literary and artistic
movement was making itself felt in the northern part
of Europe at the time. The æsthetic awakening of the
Teutonic nations had come after three centuries of
religious and political unrest, ill adapted to intellectual
development. Lessing and Winkelmann, Goethe and
Schiller, the two Schlegels and Klopstock as well as the
young poets, Uhland and Koerner, were either already
at work or were about to enter on their distinguished careers,
and the neighboring Scandinavian nations were
beginning to be seriously affected by the movement
which was going on among their brethren. In the
third year of his university course, Oersted entered
the lists as a competitor for literary honors on the question,
"What are the Limits of Prose and Poetry?" and
had the satisfaction of winning the gold medal offered
for the contest. In spite of this episode, indicative of
devotedness to the muses, Oersted passed a brilliant
pharmaceutical examination; and in the following year
succeeded in capturing another prize, this time for a
medical essay.

After such a period of preparation, it might be expected
that a brilliant career would open up for Oersted;
but, unfortunately, he could not afford to wait for slow
academic rewards, as it was absolutely necessary for
him to set about earning his livelihood. For this purpose,
shortly after graduation, he accepted the position
of manager of a drug-store. As the salary attached to
the office was rather slender, he increased his resources
by giving lectures in the evening on the familiar subjects
of chemistry, natural philosophy and metaphysics.

About this time, the wanderlust, or passion for travel,
took possession of our young philosopher; and under its
influence, he resolved to see for himself what men
of scientific avocations were doing in France and in
Germany. His own pinched circumstances would not
allow him to undertake such a journey; but he was fortunate
enough to win a stipendium cappelianum which
allowed him to travel at the expense of the government
for a period of five years, though he used it only for
three. If ever pecuniary aid was productive of enduring
results, it was so in this case.

In 1801, at the age of twenty-four, Oersted set out
from Copenhagen on his grand tour, determined to
make it a scientific as well as sentimental journey. In
Germany, which he first visited, he met Klaproth, the
orientalist; Werner, the mineralogist; Olbers the astronomer;
the philosophers Fichte, Schelling and the
two Schlegels; and above all, the young and brilliant
physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter, who discussed with him
the theory of the wonderful "pile" invented by Volta
in the previous year, 1800.

In Paris, Oersted spent about fifteen months, during
which time he was in habitual relations with many of
the savants who were just then reflecting great lustre
on French science. To mention but a few: there was
Cuvier, the leading naturalist of his age; Abbé Haüy,
crystallographer of world-wide reputation; Biot, the
brilliant expounder of physics; Charles, the discoverer
of the law which bears his name; Berthollet, the associate
of Monge the mathematician, and Lavoisier, the
chemist.

On his return to the Danish capital in 1804, Oersted
delivered courses of lectures on electricity and magnetism,
light and heat, before numerous and cultured
audiences; and such was the success which he achieved
that he was appointed, at the age of twenty-nine, to the
chair of physics in the University of Copenhagen.

For nearly forty-five years he was destined to occupy
this academical position, so that his connection with
that seat of learning rounded out the full period of half
a century.

While sedulously occupied with the duties of his
chair and the pursuit of his favorite scientific subjects,
Oersted was not unmindful of his civic and altruistic
obligations. He frequently gave popular scientific lectures,
which were open to women as well as to men.
He helped in the organization of a bureau through
which lectures would be given in various parts of the
country, and thus became a pioneer in what we call
to-day the university extension movement. When democratic
ideas began to be discussed in Denmark after
the French Revolution of 1830, Oersted was one of those
who took part in the onward movement for the betterment
of the people. In 1835, he coöperated in the
foundation of the Society for the Freedom of the Press;
and when Christian VIII. ascended the throne, he addressed
the new monarch in a speech of liberal tendency,
hailing him because of the interest which he took in the
advancement of science and in the uplift of the masses.

An idea of the position accorded to Oersted by his
colleagues in the world of science may be gathered from
an address made by Sir John Herschel at the closing
session of the Southampton meeting of the British Association
in 1836, in which the distinguished astronomer
said: "In science, there is but one direction which the
needle will take when pointed towards the European
continent, and that is towards my esteemed friend,
Professor Oersted. To look at his cool manner, who
would think that he wielded such an intense power, capable
of altering the whole state of science, and almost
the knowledge of the world? He has at this meeting
developed some of those recondite and remarkable forces
of nature which he was the first to discover, and which
went almost to the extent of obliging us to alter our
views on the most ordinary laws of energy and motion.
He elaborated his ideas with slowness and certainty,
bringing them forward only after a long lapse of time.
How often did I wish to Heaven that we could trample
down, and strike forever to earth, the hasty generalizations
which mark the present age, and bring up another
and safer system of investigation, such as that which
marked the inquiries of our friend? It was in deep
recesses, as it were, of a cell, that a faint idea first occurred
to Oersted. He waited long and calmly for the
dawn which at length broke upon him, altering the
whole relations of science and life. The electric telegraph
and other wonders of modern science were but
mere effervescences from the surface of this deep, recondite
discovery of his. If we were to characterize, by
any figure, the usefulness of Oersted to science, we
would regard him as a fertilizing shower descending
from heaven, which brought forth a new crop, delightful
to the eye and pleasing to the heart."

It may be noticed that in Oersted's day early specialization
was fortunately unknown. His education was
broad and his intellectual activities broader still. Quite
as interesting as many of his scientific researches are
some of his contributions to philosophy and some of his
views on the significance of the material universe.
Oersted, a man of the world with a wide range of
interests and a philosopher who lived at high intellectual
altitudes, was one of the all-round men in the
history of thought who took active part in science, in
literature, in politics and in social problems. He had
the opportunity of meeting many of the renowned
scientists and philosophers of the century, and had been
very closely in touch with some of them. He was a
regular attendant at scientific congresses, in which he
distinguished himself by the leading part which he took
in their deliberations. His opinions, therefore, on the
great problems of life, religious, moral, social and
political, challenge our respect even where they do not
compel our approval. Our Danish philosopher deserves,
then, to stand as the spokesman of his generation of
savants on the great questions that concern man's
relations to his fellow-men, to an all-wise Providence
and to an enduring hereafter. His opinions on these
matters are all the more interesting because they are
in open contradiction with what is sometimes thought to
be the views of scientists on such subjects.

One of the passages of his paper on "All Existence,
a Dominion of Reason," contains some surprising anticipations
of ideas that created a great stir in the intellectual
world some fifty years ago. In 1846, that is,
thirteen years before the publication of Darwin's "Origin
of Species," Oersted discussed evolution and suggested
explanations that are generally considered to have been
forced from apologists when compelled to take up the
work of reconciling Christian doctrines with scientific
conclusions.

Writing in the middle 'forties, he said: "If we are
now thoroughly convinced that everything in the material
world is produced from similar particles of matter,
by the same forces and in obedience to the same laws,
we must allow that the planets have been formed according
to the same laws as our own earth. They have
been in process of development during immeasurable
periods of time, and have undergone numerous transformations
which have also influenced the vegetable and
animal kingdoms of those remote periods. The lower
forms of life advanced by gradual stages to higher and
more complex states of organization, till at length (in a
comparatively recent period) a self-conscious being was
evolved, the crowning work of this long-continued process
of development. Accordingly, we must allow a
similar order of organic development to take place on
the other planets of our solar family. There may be
some which have not as yet attained the same degree of
development that we have reached; but everywhere
throughout the universe, creatures endowed with reason
appear in due time, just as man appeared on our own
globe. Their understanding is intimately connected
with the organs of sense which they possess; therefore,
the nature of their mental faculties cannot be essentially
different from our own. That I may avoid even
the appearance of materialism, I must direct attention
to the conciliatory principle, that the natural environment
from which man springs must be recognized as
the work of the eternal, creative Spirit. In other words,
our conception of the universe is incomplete, if not comprehended
as a constant and continuous work of the
eternally creating Spirit."

Thus far Oersted; let us here recall what Lord Kelvin,
the representative scientist of his day, quoted with
approval on a memorable occasion from the Danish
scientist with regard to the basic truths of science,
philosophy and religion. "It will not be foreign to our
purpose if, called upon by the solemnities of this day,
we endeavor to establish our conviction of the harmony
that subsists between religion and science, by showing
how the man of science must look upon his pursuits, if
he understands them rightly, as an exercise of religion.

"If my purpose here was merely to show that science
necessarily engenders piety, I should appeal to the great
truth everywhere recognized, that the essence of all
religion consists in love toward God. The conclusion
would then be easy, that love of Him from whom all
truth proceeds must create the desire to acknowledge
truth in all her paths; but as we desire here to recognize
science herself as a religious duty, it will be requisite
for us to penetrate deeper into its nature. It is
obvious, therefore, that the searching eye of man,
whether he regards his own inward being or the creation
surrounding him, is always led to the Eternal
Source of all things. In all inquiry, the ultimate aim is
to discover that which really exists and to contemplate
it in its pure light apart from all that deceives the
careless observer by only a seeming existence. The
philosopher will then comprehend what, amidst ceaseless
change, is the Constant and Uncreated, which is
hidden behind unnumbered creations, the bond of union
which keeps things together in spite of their manifold
divisions and separations. He must soon acknowledge
that the independent can only be the constant and the
constant the independent, and that true unity is inseparable
from either of these. And thus it is in the
nature of thought that it finds no quiet resting place, no
pause, except in the invariable, eternal, uncaused, all-causing,
all-comprehensive Omniscience.

"But, if this one-sided view does not satisfy him, if he
seeks to examine the world with the eye of experience,
he perceives that all those things of whose reality the
multitude feels most assured never have an enduring
existence, but are always on the road between birth and
death. If he now properly comprehends the whole
array of nature, he perceives that it is not merely an
idea or an abstract notion, as it is called; but that reason
and the power to which everything is indebted for
its essential nature are only the revelation of a self-sustained
Being. How can he, when he sees this, be
otherwise animated than by the deepest feeling of humility,
of devotion and of love? If anyone has learned a
different lesson from his observation of nature, it could
only be because he lost his way amidst the dispersion
and variety of creation and had not looked upwards to
the eternal unity of truth."

As already said, Oersted lived to celebrate the fiftieth
year of his connection with his university. This
was in November, 1850, on which occasion his friends,
pupils and the public generally united together in honoring
him as a professor whose warm and animated lectures
enraptured audiences; as a leader in the scientific
advance of the times; and as a Christian to whom nature
was but a manifestation of the Deity's combined
wisdom and creative power.

The aged scientist, much touched by this popular demonstration
as well as by the tokens of esteem given him
by the King, spoke of this jubilee celebration as the
happiest day of his life. The reader will recall another
great man, great in the world of politics and great on
the field of battle, who said that the happiest day of his
life was that of his first communion.

A few months after celebrating his golden jubilee,
Oersted passed away, after a short illness, on March
9th, 1851, deeply mourned by all.

Oersted was eminent as a scholar and equally eminent
as a man; lenient in his judgment of others, he
was strict with regard to himself; simple in his ways
and frugal in living, he was benevolent to others, being
always ready to give a helping hand wherever needed.
To such a man may well be applied these beautiful
words with which Priestley begins his "History of
Electricity": "A life spent in the contemplation of the
productions of divine power, wisdom and goodness,
would be a life of devotion. The more we see of the
wonderful structure of the world and of the laws of
nature, the more clearly do we comprehend their admirable
uses to make all percipient creation happy, a sentiment
which cannot but fill the heart with unbounded
love, gratitude and joy."

A statue to the memory of Oersted was unveiled in
Copenhagen on September 25th, 1876, in presence of
the King of Denmark, the King of Greece, the Danish
Crown Prince and members of the Royal family, as well
as numerous high officials, representatives of learned
societies and a vast body of students and people assembled
together to do honor to a man who was distinguished
alike by his scientific attainments and philosophical
acumen, and who, during his long life, never
faltered in his devotedness to the welfare of his country
as he never weakened in his defense of the great
truths of religion.

CHAPTER VIII.
André Marie Ampère.


Few men of the nineteenth century are so interesting
as André Marie Ampère, who is, as we have seen,
deservedly spoken of as the founder of the science
of electro-dynamics. Extremely precocious as a boy, so
that, like his immediate predecessor in discovery, Oersted
the Dane, his rapid intellectual development drew
down upon him ominous expressions from those who
knew him, he more than fulfilled the highest promise of
his early years. His was no one-sided genius. He was
interested in everything, and his memory was as retentive
as his intellect was comprehensive. He grew up,
indeed, to be a young man of the widest possible interests.
Literature never failed to have its attraction
for him, though science was his favorite study and
mathematics his hobby. The mathematical mind is commonly
supposed to run in very precise grooves, yet
Ampère was always a speculator, and his speculations
were most suggestive for his contemporaries and subsequent
generations. Indeed, his mathematics, far from
being a hindrance to his penetrating outlook upon the
hazier confines of science, rather seemed to help the
penetrations it gave. While he was so great a scientist
that Arago, so little likely to exaggerate his French
contemporary's merit, has said of Ampère's discovery
identifying magnetism and electricity, that "the vast
field of physical science perhaps never presented so
brilliant a discovery, conceived, verified, and completed
with such rapidity," his friends knew this great scientist
as one of the kindliest and most genial of men,
noted for his simplicity, his persuasive sympathy and
his tender regard for all those with whom he was
brought into intimate relations.



André Marie Ampère


The commonly accepted formula for a great scientist,
that he is a man wrapt up in himself and his work,
enmeshed so completely in the scientific speculations
that occupy him that he has little or no time for great
humanitarian interests, so that his human sympathies
are likely to atrophy, is entirely contradicted by the life
of Ampère. He was no narrow specialist, and, indeed,
it may be said that not a single one of these great discoverers
in electricity whom we are considering in this
volume was of the type that is sometimes accepted as
indicative of scientific genius and originality. After
reading their lives, one is prone to have the feeling that
men who lack that wider sympathy which, in the famous
words of the old Latin poet, makes everything human
of interest to them, are not of the mental calibre to
make supreme discoveries, even though they may succeed
in creating a large amount of interest in their
scientific speculations in their own generation. It is the
all-round man who does supreme original work of enduring
quality.

André Marie Ampère was born at Lyons, January 22d,
1775. His father, Jean Jacques Ampère, was a small
merchant who made a comfortable living for his family,
but no more. His father and mother were both well
informed for their class and time, and were well esteemed
by their neighbors. His mother especially was
known for an unalterable sweetness of character and
charitable beneficence which sought out every possible
occasion for its exercise. She was universally beloved
by those who knew her, and the charm of Ampère's
manner, which made for him a friend of every acquaintance,
was undoubtedly a manifestation of the same
family strain.

Shortly after the birth of their son, the parents gave
up business and retired on a little property situated in
the country not far from Lyons. It was in this little
village, without any school-teacher and with only home
instruction, that the genius of the future savant, who
was to be one of the distinguished scientific men of the
nineteenth century, began to show itself. For Ampère
was not only a genius, but, what is so often thought to
be an almost absolute preclusion of any serious achievement
later in life, a precocious genius. The first marvelous
faculty that began to develop in him was an
uncontrollable tendency to arithmetical expression. Before
he knew how to make figures, he had invented
for himself a method of doing even rather complicated
problems in arithmetic by the aid of a number of pebbles
or peas. During an illness that overtook him as a
child, his mother, anxious because of the possible evil
effects upon his health of mental work, took his pebbles
away from him. He supplied their place, however,
during the leisure hours of his convalescence, when time
hung heavy on his child hands, by bread crumbs. He
craved food, but, according to the "starving" medical
régime of the time, he was allowed only a single biscuit
in three days. It required no little self-sacrifice on his
part, then, to supply himself with counters from this
scanty supply, and his persistence, in spite of hunger,
evidently indicates that this mathematical tendency was
stronger than his appetite for food. This is all the more
surprising, since children are usually scarcely more than
little animals in the matter of eating, and commonly
satisfy their physical cravings without an after-thought
of any kind.

Ampère learned to read when but very young, and
then began to devour all the books which came to
hand. Usually, the precocious taste for reading specializes
on some particular subject; but everything was
grist that came to the child Ampère's mental mill, and
it was all ground up; and, strangest of all, much of it
was assimilated. Travel, history, poetry, occupied him
quite as much as romance; and, amazing as it may
appear, even philosophy was not disdained while he
was still under ten years of age. It seems amusing to
read the declaration of the French biographer, that if
this boy of ten had any special predilection in literature,
it was for Homer, Lucan, Tasso, Fénelon, Corneille
and Voltaire, yet it must be taken seriously.

When he was about fifteen, this omnivorous intellectual
genius came across a French encyclopedia in
twenty folio volumes. This seemed to him a veritable
Golconda of endless riches of information. Each of the
volumes had its turn. The second was begun as soon
as the first was finished, and the reading of the third
followed, and so on, until every one of the volumes had
been completely read. References to other volumes
might be looked up occasionally, but this did not distract
him into taking other portions of the works out of
alphabetical order. Surprising as it must seem, most of
this heterogeneous mass of information, far from being
forgotten at once, was deeply engraved on his wonderful
memory. More than once in after-life, when many
years had passed, it was a surprise to his friends to find
how much information Ampère had amassed on some
abstruse and unfamiliar subject, and how readily he
was able to pour forth details of information that
seemed quite out of his line. He would then confess
that the encyclopedia article on the subject, read so
many years before, was still fresh in his mind, or at
least that its information was so stored away as to be
readily available. We have heard much of Gladstone's
memory in more recent years; but that seems to have
been nothing compared to this wonderful faculty which
recalled for Ampère, even as an old man, the unrelated
details of every encyclopedia article that had passed
under his eyes half a century before, when he was a
boy of ten to fourteen.

The modest family library soon proved utterly insufficient
to occupy the mind of this young, enthusiastic
student; and his father, sympathetic to his ardent
curiosity, took him to Lyons from time to time, where
he might have the opportunity to consult volumes of
various kinds that might catch his fancy. At this
time, his old mathematical tendency reasserted itself.
He wished to learn something about the higher mathematics.
He found in a library in Lyons the works of
Bernoulli and of Euler. When the delicate-looking
boy, whom the librarian considered little more than a
child, put in his request to the town library for these
serious mathematical works, the old gentleman said to
him: "The works of Bernoulli and Euler! What are
you thinking of, my little friend? These works figure
among the most difficult writings that ever came from
the mind of man." "I hope to be able to understand
them," replied the boy. "I suppose you know," said
the librarian, "that they are written in Latin." This
was a disagreeable surprise for young Ampère. As
yet he had not studied Latin. He went home, resolved,
however, to remove this hindrance to his study of the
higher mathematics. At the end of the month, owing
to his assiduity, the obstacle had entirely disappeared;
and though he could read only mathematical Latin and
had later to study the language from another standpoint,
in order to understand the classics, he was now
able to pursue the study of mathematics in Latin to his
heart's content.

The even tenor of the boy's life, deeply engaged as
he was in studies of every description, was destined to
be very seriously disturbed. When he was but fourteen,
in 1789, the Revolution came, with its glorious
promise and then its awful consummation. Ampère's
father was seriously alarmed at the revolutionary course
things were taking in France, and had the fatal inspiration
to leave his country home and betake himself to
the city of Lyons. For a time, he occupied a position
as magistrate. After the siege of Lyons, the revolutionary
tribunal established there took up the project of
making the Lyonnese patriotic, as they called it, by
properly punishing the citizens for their failure to sympathize
at first with the revolutionary government, and
soon a series of horrible massacres began. New victims
were claimed every day, and Ampère's father was one
of those who had to suffer. The real reason for his
condemnation was that he had accepted a position
under the old government, though the pretext stated
on the warrant for his arrest was that he was an
aristocrat. This is the only evidence we have that the
Ampère family was in any way connected with the
nobility. The day on which he was sentenced to die,
Jean Jacques Ampère wrote to his wife a letter of
sublime simplicity, in which his Christian resignation
of spirit, his lofty courage, yet thoroughly practical
commonsense, are manifest. He warned his wife to say
nothing about his fate to their daughter Josephine,
though he hoped that his son would be better able to
stand the blow, and perhaps prove a consolation to his
mother.

The news proved almost too much for the young
Ampère, and for a time his reason was despaired of.
All his faculties seemed to be shocked for the moment
into insensibility. Biographers tell us that he wandered
around, building little piles of sand, gazing idly at the
stars or vacantly into space, wearing scarcely any of the
expression of a rational being. His friends could harbor
only the worst possible expectations for him, and
even his physical health suffered so much that it seemed
he would not long survive. One day, by chance, Rousseau's
"Letters on Botany" fell into his hands. They
caught his attention, and he became interested in their
charming narrative style, and as a result, his reason
awoke once more. He began to study botany in the
field, and soon acquired a taste for the reading of
Linnæus. At the same time, classic poetry, especially
such as contained descriptions of nature, once more
appealed to him, and so he took up his classical studies.
He varied the reading of the poets with dissections of
flowers, and yet succeeded in following both sets of
studies so attentively that, forty years afterward, he
was still perfectly capable of taking up the technical
description of the plants that he had then studied, and
while acting as a university inspector, he composed 150
Latin verses during his horseback rides from one inspection
district to another, without ever having to consult
a gradus or a dictionary for the quantities, yet without
making a single mistake. His memory for subjects
once learned, was almost literally infallible.

Something of his love for nature can be appreciated
from an incident of his early manhood, which is not
without its amusing side. Ampère was very near-sighted,
and had been able to read books all his life only
by holding them very close to his eyes. This makes it
all the more difficult to understand how he succeeded in
reading so much. His near-sightedness was so marked
that he had no idea of beauties of scenery beyond him,
and was often rather put out at the enthusiastic description
of scenes through which he passed en diligence,
when his fellow-travelers spoke of the beauties of the
scenes around them. Ampère, like most people who do
not share, or at least appreciate, the enthusiasm of
others for beautiful things around them, was in this
mood, mainly because he was not able to see them in
the way that others did, and, therefore, could not have
the same pleasure in them. This lack in himself was
unconscious, of course, as in all other cases, and, far from
lessening, rather emphasized the tendency to be impatient
with others, and rather made him more ready
to think how foolish they were to go into ecstasies over
something that to him was so insignificant.

One day, while Ampère was making the journey along
the Saone into Lyons, it happened that there sat beside
him on the stage-coach a young man who suffered from
near-sightedness very nearly in the same degree as
Ampère himself, but whose myopia had been corrected
by means of properly fitting glasses. These glasses
were just exactly what Ampère needed in order to correct
his vision completely. The young fellows became
interested in each other, and, during the course of their
conversation, his companion suggested to Ampère, seeing
how near-sighted he was, that he should try his
glasses. He put them on, and at once nature presented
herself to him under an entirely different aspect. The
vision was so unexpected, that the description which he
had so often heard from his fellow-travelers, but could
not appreciate, now recurred to him, and he could not
help exclaiming in raptures, "Oh! what a smiling country!
What picturesque, graceful hills! How the rich,
warm tones are harmoniously blended in the wonderful
union of sky and mountain vista!" All of these now
spoke emphatically to his delicate sensibility, and a new
world was literally revealed to him. Ampère was so
overcome by this unexpected sight, which gave him so
much pleasure, that he burst into tears from depth of
emotion, and could not satisfy himself with looking at
all the beauties of nature that had been hidden from him
for so long. Ever after, natural scenery was one of the
greatest pleasures that he had in life, and the beauties
of nature, near or distant, meant more to him than any
other gratification of the senses.

In spite of the fact that Ampère had devoted considerable
attention to acoustics as a young man, and
had studied the ways in which the waves of air by
which sounds are formed and propagated, he had
absolutely no ear for music, and was as tone-deaf as he
had been blind before his discovery with regard to the
glasses. Musical notes constituted a mathematical
problem for Ampère, but nothing more. This continued
to be the case until about thirty years of age. Then,
one day, he attended a musical soirée, at which the
principal portions of the program were taken from
Glück. It is easy to understand that this master of
harmony possessed no charms for a tone-deaf young
man. He became uneasy during the course of the
musical program, and his uneasiness became manifest
to others. After the selections of the German composer
were finished, however, some simple but charming
melodies were unexpectedly introduced, and Ampère
suddenly found himself transported into a new world.
If we are to believe his biographers, once more his
emotion was expressed by an abundance of tears, which
Ampère seems to have had at command and to have
been quite as ready to give way to in public as any of
Homer's heroes of the olden time. Blind until he was
nearly twenty, he used to say of himself, he had been
deaf until he was thirty. In spite of his failure to respond
in youth, once it had been awakened to appreciation,
his soul vibrated profoundly to all the beauties of
color and sound, and, later in life, they gave rise in
him to depths of emotion which calmer individuals of
less delicate sensibilities could scarcely understand, much
less sympathize with.

Between his two supreme experiences in vision and
sound, there had come to Ampère another and even
profounder emotion. He tells the story himself, in
words that probably express his feelings better than
any possible description of his biographer could do, and
that show us how wonderfully sensitive his soul was to
emotion of all kinds. He had just completed his twenty-first
year when he fell head over heels in love. Though
he wrote very little, as a rule, he has left us a rather
detailed description in diaries, evidently kept for the
purpose, of the state of his feelings at this time. These
bear the title, "Amorum," the story of his love. On
the first page these words occur: "One day as I was taking
an evening walk, just after the setting of the sun,
making my way along a little brook," then there is a
hiatus, and he was evidently quite unable to express all
that he felt. It seems that he was gathering botanical
specimens, wearing an excellent set of spectacles ever
since his adventure on the stage-coach had shown him
the need of them, when he suddenly perceived at some
distance two young and charming girls who were gathering
flowers in the field. He looked at one of them, and
he knew that his fate was sealed. Up to that time, as
he says, the idea of marriage had never occurred to
him. One might think that the idea would occur very
gently at first, then grow little by little; but that was
not Ampère's way. He wanted to marry her that very
day. He did not know her name; he did not know her
family; he had never even heard her voice, but he
knew that she was the destined one.

Fortunately for the young lady and himself, she had
very sensible parents. They demanded how he would
be able to support a wife. Ampère was quite willing to
do anything that they should suggest. His father had
left enough to support the family, but not enough to
enable him to support a wife in an independent home;
and until he had some occupation, the parents of his
bride-to-be refused to listen to his representations.
For a time, he consented to be a salesman in a silk store
in Lyons, in order to have some occupation which
might eventually give him enough money to enable him
to marry. Fortunately, however, he was diverted from
a commercial vocation which might thus have absorbed
a great scientist, and arrangements were made which
permitted him to continue his intellectual life, yet have
the woman of his choice. She was destined to make life
happier far for him than is the usual lot of man, and he
was ever ready to acknowledge how much she meant
for his happiness.

With literature, poetry, love and settling down in life
to occupy him, it is hard to think of Ampère as a young
man doing great work in science, but he did; and his
work deservedly attracted attention even from his very
early years. It was in pure mathematics, perhaps,
above all other branches, that Ampère attracted the
attention of his generation. Ordinary questions he did
not care for. Problems which the fruitless efforts of
twenty centuries had pronounced insoluble attracted
him at once. Even the squaring of the circle claimed
his attention for a while, though he got well beyond it
even before his boyhood passed away. There is a
manuscript note from the Secretary of the Academy of
Lyons, which shows that on July 8th, 1788, Ampère,
then not quite thirteen years of age, addressed to that
learned body a paper on the "Squaring of the Circle."
Later, during the same year, he submitted an analogous
memoir, entitled, "The Rectification of an Arc of a
Circle, less than a Semi-circumference."

Arago says that he was tempted to suppress this story
of Ampère's coquetting with so dangerous a problem,
for Ampère rather flattered himself that he had almost
solved it. It was only after Arago recalled how many
geniuses in mathematics had occupied themselves with
this same problem, that he saw his way clearly not to
share the scruples of those who might think this incident
a reflection on Ampère's mathematical genius.
After all, Anaxagoras, Hippocrates, Archimedes and
Apollonius, among the ancients, and among the moderns,
Willebrod Snell, Huyghens, Gregory, Wallis, and finally
Newton, the mathematician of the heavens, occupied
themselves seriously with this very problem. Arago
even notes that some men, by their speculations on the
squaring of the circle, were led to distinguished discoveries,
and mentions the name of Father Grégoire de
Saint-Vincent, the distinguished Flemish mathematician
of the Society of Jesus, to whom, as a direct result of
his studies in attempted circle-squaring, we owe the
discovery of the properties of hyperbolic space, limited
by the curve and its asymptotes, as well as the expansion
of log (1 + x) in ascending powers of x. Montucla,
the historian of mathematics, writing of Père
Saint-Vincent, said that, "No one ever squared the
circle with so much ability or with so much success."
There was, however, a fallacy in his magnificent work
which was pointed out by the celebrated Huyghens.

Shortly after the beginning of the nineteenth century,
Ampère, as one of his French biographers rather characteristically
declares, redeemed whatever of mathematical
sinning there might have been, in indulging in
fond dalliance with the squaring of the circle, by a series
of mathematical papers, each of which was in itself a
distinct advance on previous knowledge, and at the
same time, definite evidence of his mathematical ability.
The first paper, published in 1801, was a contribution to
solid geometry, bearing the title, "On Oblique Polyhedrons."
His next paper, written in 1803, though not
published until 1808, was a treatise on the advantages
to be derived in the theory of curves from due consideration
of the osculating parabola. Another treatise,
written about the same time, had for title, "Investigations
on the Application of the General Formulæ of
the Calculus of Variations to Problems in Mechanics."
This concerned problems which had interested and, in
most cases, proved too hard of solution even for such
men as Galileo, Jacques Bernoulli, Leibnitz, Huyghens
and Jean Bernoulli. Arago's expression with regard to
this work is: "The treatise of Ampère contains, in fact,
new and very remarkable properties of the catenary
(la chainette) and its development." He adds: "There
is no small merit in discovering hiatuses in subjects explored
by such men as Leibnitz, Huyghens and the two
Bernoullis. I must not forget to add that the analysis
of our associate unites elegance with simplicity."

It is not surprising, after such marks of mathematical
genius, that Ampère was appointed to the chair of
mathematics at the École Polytechnique, where he came
to be looked upon as one of the most distinguished of
French mathematicians. In 1813, he became a candidate
for the position left vacant by the death of the
famous Lagrange; and at this time, presented to the
Academy general considerations on the integration of
partial differential equations of the first and the second
order. After his election to the Academy, Ampère continued
to present important papers at its various sessions.
Among these, three are especially noteworthy:
one was a demonstration of Père Mariotte's law (known
to English students as Boyle's law); another bore the
title, "Demonstration of a new Theory from which can
be deduced all the Laws of Refraction, ordinary and extraordinary";
a third was a memoir on the "Determination
of the curved surfaces of Luminous Waves in a medium
whose Elasticity differs in each of the three dimensions."

In his eulogy of Ampère, which, together with his
article in the "Dictionnaire Universelle de Biographie,"
we have followed rather closely, Arago calls particular
attention to the fact that in Paris, Ampère moved in
two intellectual circles quite widely separated in their
interests and sympathies. Among the first group, were
the members of the old "Institute" and professors and
examiners of the École Polytechnique and professors of
the Collège de France. In the other, were the men
whose names have since become widely known as students
of psychology, of whom Cabanis may be taken as
the representative. Ampère had as great a passion for
psychology, and was as ready to devote himself to
fathoming and analyzing the mysteries of the mind, as
he was to work out a problem in advanced mathematics,
or throw light on difficult questions in the physical
sciences. These two sets of interests are seldom united
in the same man, though occasionally they are found.
At the end of the nineteenth century, we had the spectacle
of very distinguished men of science in physics, and
even in biology       Sir William Crookes, Sir Oliver Lodge,
Professor Charles Richet, Professor Lombroso and even
Mr. Alfred Russell Wallace       interested in psychic and
spiritualistic manifestations of many kinds as well as in
natural science; and, inasmuch as they did so, they
would have found Ampère a brother spirit. Ampère
indeed dived rather deeply into what would be called,
somewhat slightingly, perhaps, in our generation, metaphysical
speculation. At one time, he contemplated the
publication of a book which was to be called "An
Introduction to Philosophy." He had made elaborate
theories with regard to many metaphysical questions,
and had written articles on "The Theory of Relations,"
"The History of Existence," "Subjective and Objective
Knowledge" and "Absolute Morality." Arago calls
attention to the fact that Napoleon's famous anathema
against ideology, far from discouraging Ampère, rather
seemed to stimulate him in his studies, and he declared
that it would surely contribute to the propagation of
this kind of speculation, rather than to its suppression.
It was simply another case of Napoleon overreaching
himself, though this was in the domain of ideas and not
in the realm of politics, where his fate was to reach him
some time later.

How deeply interested Ampère became in metaphysics
will perhaps be best appreciated from the fact that, for
progress in metaphysics, exercise in disputation is
needed, and had been the custom in the old medieval
universities. Ampère once made an arrangement to
travel from Paris to Lyons and stay there for some
time, provided a definite promise was made that at least
four afternoons a week should be devoted to discussions
on ideology. The journey to Lyons, a distance of two
hundred and fifty miles, was no easy undertaking in
those days. The Paris, Lyons and Mediterranean Express
now whirls one down to the capital of the silk district
in a night; but in Ampère's time, it took many days,
and the journey was by no means without inconveniences,
which were likely to be so troublesome that a prolonged
rest was needed after it was over. Ampère seems quite
to have exhausted the interest of his friends in Lyons,
who found his metaphysical speculations too high for
them, though they themselves were specializing in the
subject and would be glad to tempt him into discussions
of the exact sciences; but in lyrical strain he apostrophizes
psychological studies: "How can I abandon the country,
the flowers and running waters for the arid
streets of the city! How give up streams and groves
for deserts scorched by the rays of a mathematical sun,
which, diffusing over all surrounding objects the most
brilliant light, withers and dries them down to the very
roots! How much more agreeable to wander under
flitting shades, where truth seems to flee before us to
incite us to pursue, than walk in straight paths where
the eye embraces all at a glance!"

Had Ampère been less successful as a mathematician
or an investigator of physical science, these expressions
would seem little short of ridiculous. As it is, they
provide food for thought. Ampère seemed to realize
that, for the intellectual man, the only satisfaction was
not in successful research so much as in application of
mind to what promised results. As in everything else,
it was the chase, and not the capture, that counted.
Seldom has this idea been applied to intellectual things
with so much force as it seems to have appealed to
Ampère, and one is reminded of Malebranche's famous
expression, "If I had truth in my hand, I would be
tempted to let it go for the pleasure of recapturing it."

The principal source of Ampère's fame, however, for
future generations, was to be in his researches in the
science of electro-dynamics. The name of this science
will ever be inseparably linked with that of Ampère, its
founder. It was for that reason, of course, that the
International Congress of Electricians decided to give his
name to the unit of current strength, so that it has now
become a household word, and will continue so for ages
to come. In spite of the resemblances, much more than
superficial, between magnetism and electricity, the identification
of these two with each other seemed as yet
very distant. It is curiously interesting, however, to
note that Ampère himself, in a program of his course,
printed in 1802, announced that the "professor will
demonstrate that electrical and magnetic phenomena
must be attributed to two different fluids which act independently
of each other." Ampère's fame was to be
founded on the direct contradiction of this proposition,
which he proposed and triumphantly defended by a
marvelous series of experimental illustrations eighteen
years later. In the meantime, the discovery of another
distinguished scientist, doing his work many hundreds
of miles away, was to prove the stimulus to Ampère's
constructive imagination, so as to enable him to fill out
many obscure points of knowledge with regard to magnetism
and electricity.

This suggestive discovery was that of Oersted, the
sketch of whose life and work immediately precedes
this. Oersted demonstrated that a current of electricity
will affect a magnetic needle. This epoch-making discovery
reached Paris by way of Switzerland. The
experiment was repeated before the French Academy
of Sciences by a member of the Academy of Geneva, on
September 11th, 1820. The date has some importance
in the history of science, for just seven days later, on
the 18th of September, Ampère presented, at the session
of the Academy of Sciences, a still more important
fact, to which he had been led by the consideration of
Oersted's discovery while testing it by way of control
experiment. This brilliant discovery of Ampère, Arago
summed up in these words: "Two parallel conducting
wires attract each other when the current traverses them
in the same direction. On the contrary, they repel
each other when the current flows in opposite directions.
The phenomenon described by Oersted was called, very
appropriately, electromagnetic, whilst the phenomena
described by Ampère, in which the magnet played no
part, received at his suggestion the general name of
electro-dynamics, which has since been applied to them."

At first it was said that these phenomena were nothing
more than manifestations of the ordinary attractive and
repelling power of the two forms of electricity which
had been so carefully studied, especially in France, during
the eighteenth century. Ampère at once disposed
of any such idea as this, however, by pointing out that
bodies similarly electrified repel each other, whilst those
that are in opposite electrical states attract each other.
In the case of conductors conveying currents, there is
attraction when these are in the same direction, and
repulsion when they flow in the opposite direction. This
reasoning absolutely precluded all possibility of further
doubt in the matter, and this particular form of objection
to Ampère's discoveries was dropped at once.

Having satisfactorily disposed of other objections,
Ampère was content neither to rest quietly in his discovery
nor merely to develop various experimental phases
of it which would be extremely interesting and popularly
attractive, but which at the same time might mean
very little for science. With his mathematical mind, Ampère
resolved to work out a mathematical theory which
would embrace not only all the phenomena of magnetism
then known, but also the complete theory of the science
of electro-dynamics. Needless to say, such a problem was
extremely difficult. Arago has compared it to Newton's
solution of the problem of gravitation by mathematics.
Considering the comparatively small amount of data
that Ampère had at his command, this problem might
very well be compared to that which Leverrier took up
with so much success, when he set about discovering by
calculation only the planet Neptune, as yet unknown,
which was disturbing the movements of Uranus.

It might be thought that these discoveries of Ampère
would be welcomed with great enthusiasm. As a matter
of fact, however, new discoveries that are really novel
always have, as almost their surest index, the fact that
contemporaries refuse to accept them. The more versed
a man is in the science in which the discovery comes, the
more likely is he to delay his acceptance of the novelty.
This is not so surprising, since, as a rule, new discoveries
are nearly always very simple expressions of great truths
that seem obvious once they are accepted, yet have never
been thought of. They mean, therefore, that men who
consider themselves distinguished in a particular science
have missed some easily discoverable phenomenon or its
full significance, and so, to accept a new discovery in
their department of learning men must confess their
own lack of foresight.

It may be pointed out that the same thing happened
with regard to Ohm, only it was much more serious.
Years of Ohm's life were wasted because of the refusal
of his contemporaries to accept his "law" at his valuation.
Arago, in his life of Ampère, recalls that when
Fresnel discovered the transverse character of waves of
light, his observations created the same doubts and uncertainty
in the same individuals who a few years later
refused to accept Ampère's conclusions. Arago puts it,
that as he was ambitious of a high place in the world of
ideas, he should have expected to find his adversaries
precisely those already occupying the highest places.

Ampère never looked on himself as a mere specialist
in physical science, however, and it is extremely interesting
to know that he dared to take sides in a discussion
between Cuvier and Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, with
regard to the unity of structure in organized beings.
While the purely physical scientists mostly sat mute
during the discussion, Ampère took an active share in it,
and ventured to subject himself to what perhaps, above
all things, a Frenchman dreads, the ridicule of his colleagues.
Arago thought that he held his own very well
in this discussion, which involved some of the ideas that
were afterwards to be the subject of profound study and
prolonged investigation later in the nineteenth century,
because of the announcement of the theory of evolution.

After his discoveries in electricity Ampère came to be
acknowledged as one of the greatest of living scientists,
and was honored as such by most of the distinguished
scientific societies of Europe. His work was not confined
to electricity alone, however, and late in life he
prepared what has been well called a remarkable work
on the classification of the sciences. This showed that,
far from being a mere electrical specialist or even a
profound thinker in physics, he understood better probably
than any man of his time the interrelations of the
sciences to one another. He was a broad-minded, profound
thinker in the highest sense of the words, and in
many things seems to have had almost an intuition of
the intimate processes of nature; a sharer in secrets as
yet unrevealed, though he was at the same time an
untiring experimenter, eminently successful, as is so
evident in his electrical researches, in arranging experiments
so as to compel answers to the questions which
he put to nature.

In the midst of all this preoccupation of mind with
science and all the scientific problems that were working
in men's minds in his time, from the constitution of
matter to the nature of life, above all engaged in
experimental work, he was a deeply religious man in
his opinions and practices. He had indeed the simple
piety of a child. During the awful period of the French
Revolution, he had some doubts with regard to religious
truths; but once these were dispelled, he became one of
the most faithful practical Catholics of his generation.
He seldom passed a day without finding his way into a
church, and his favorite form of prayer was the rosary.

Frederick Ozanam tells the story of how he himself,
overtaken by misgivings with regard to faith, and
roaming almost aimlessly through the streets of Paris
trying to think out solutions for his doubts, and the
problems that would so insistently present themselves
respecting the intellectual foundations of Christianity,
finally wandered one day into a church, and found
Ampère there in an obscure corner, telling his beads.
Ozanam himself was moved to do the same thing, for
Ampère was then looked upon as one of the greatest
living scientists of France. Under the magic touch of
an example like this and the quiet influence of prayer,
Ozanam's doubts vanished, never to return.

Saint-Beuve, whose testimony in a matter like this
would surely be unsuspected of any tendency to make
Ampère more Catholic than he was, in his introduction
to Ampère's essay on the Philosophy of the Sciences
(Paris, 1843), says:

"The religious struggles and doubts of his earlier life
had ceased. What disturbed him now lay in less exalted
regions. Years ago, his interior conflicts, his instinctive
yearning for the Eternal, and a lively correspondence with
his old friend, Father Barrett, combined with the general
tendency of the time of the Restoration, had
led him back to that faith and devotion which he
expressed so strikingly in 1803.... During the years
which followed, up to the time of his death, we were
filled with wonder and admiration at the way in which,
without effort, he united religion and science; faith and
confidence in the intellectual possibilities of man with
adoring submission to the revealed word of God."

Ozanam, to whose thoroughly practical Christianity
while he was professor of Foreign Literatures at the
University of Paris we owe the foundation of the Conferences
of St. Vincent de Paul, which so long anticipated
the "settlement work" of the modern time and
have done so much for the poor in large cities ever since,
was very close to Ampère, lived with him indeed for a
while, said that, no matter where conversations with
him began, they always led up to God. The great
French scientist and philosopher used to take his broad
forehead between his hands after he had been discussing
some specially deep question of science or philosophy
and say: "How great is God, Ozanam! How great is
God and how little is our knowledge!" Of course this
has been the expression of most profound thinkers at
all times. St. Augustine's famous vision of the angel
standing by the sea emptying it out with a teaspoon,
which has been rendered so living for most of us by Botticelli's
great picture, is but an earlier example of the
same thing. One of Ampère's greatest contemporaries,
Laplace, re-echoed the same sentiment, perhaps in less
striking terms, when he declared that what we know is
but little, while what we do not know is infinite.

For anyone who desires to study the beautiful Christian
simplicity of a truly great soul, there is no better
human document than the "Journal and Correspondence
of Ampère," published some years after his death. He
himself wrote out the love story of his life; and it is
perhaps one of the most charming of narratives, certainly
the most delightful autobiographic story of this
kind that has ever been told. It is human to the very
core, and it shows a wonderfully sympathetic character
in a great man, whose work was destined a few years
later to revolutionize physics and to found the practical
science of electro-dynamics.

When Ampère's death was impending, it was suggested
that a chapter of the "Imitation of Christ"
should be read to him; but he said, no! declaring that
he preferred to be left alone for a while, as he knew the
"Imitation" by heart and would repeat those chapters
in which he found most consolation. With the profoundest
sentiments of piety and confidence in Providence,
he passed away June 10th, 1836, at Marseilles.

With all his solid piety, this man was not so distant
from ordinary worldly affairs as not to take a lively
interest in all that was happening around him and,
above all, all that concerned the welfare of men. He
was especially enthusiastic for the freedom of the South
American Republics, eagerly following the course of
Bolivar and Canaris, and rejoicing at the success of
their efforts. South American patriots visiting Paris
found a warm welcome at his hands, and also introductions
that made life pleasant for them at the French
capital. His house was always open to them, and no
service that he performed for them seemed too much.

Ampère was beloved by his family and his friends;
he was perhaps the best liked man among his circle of
acquaintances in Paris because of the charming geniality
of his character and his manifold interests. He was
kind, above all, to rising young men in the intellectual
world around him, and was looked up to by many of
them as almost a second father. His charity towards the
poor was proverbial, and this side of his personality
and career deserves to be studied quite as much as
what he was able to accomplish for science. The
beauty of his character was rooted deeply in the religion
that he professed, and in our day, when it has come to
be the custom for so many to think that science and
faith are inalterably opposed, the lesson of this life, so
deeply imbued with both of these great human interests,
deserves to be studied. Ozanam, who knew him best,
has brought out this extremely interesting union of
intellectual qualities, in a passage that serves very
well to sum up the meaning of Ampère's life.

"In addition to his scientific achievements," says
Ozanam, "this brilliant genius has other claims upon
our admiration and affection. He was our brother in
the faith. It was religion which guided the labors of
his mind and illuminated his contemplations; he judged
all things, science itself, by the exalted standard of
religion.... This venerable head which was crowned by
achievements and honors, bowed without reserve before
the mysteries of faith, down even below the line which
the Church has marked for us. He prayed before the
same altars before which Descartes and Pascal had
knelt; beside the poor widow and the small child who
may have been less humble in mind than he was. Nobody
observed the regulations of the Church more
conscientiously, regulations which are so hard on nature
and yet so sweet in the habit. Above all things, however,
it is beautiful to see what sublime things Christianity
wrought in his great soul; this admirable
simplicity, the unassumingness of a mind that recognized
everything except its own genius; this high
rectitude in matters of science, now so rare, seeking
nothing but the truth and never rewards and distinction;
the pleasant and ungrudging amiability; and lastly,
the kindness with which he met everyone, especially
young people. I can say that those who know only the
intelligence of the man, know only the less perfect part.
If he thought much, he loved more."




CHAPTER IX.
Ohm, the Founder of Mathematical Electricity.


Lord Kelvin, himself one of the greatest of the
electrical scientists of the nineteenth century, in commenting
some years ago on Ohm's law, said that it was
such an extremely simple expression of a great truth in
electricity, that its significance is probably not confined
to that department of physical phenomena, but that it
is a law of nature in some much broader way. Re-echoing
this expression of his colleague, Professor George
Chrystal, of Edinburgh, in his article on electricity in
the Encyclopedia Britannica (IX. edition), says that
Ohm's law "must now be allowed to rank with the law
of gravitation and the elementary laws of statical electricity
as a law of nature in the strictest sense." In a
word, to these leaders and teachers in physical science
of the generation after his, though within a comparatively
short time after Ohm's death, there has come the
complete realization of the absolutely fundamental
character of the discovery made by George Simon Ohm,
when he promulgated the principle that a current of
electricity is to be measured by the electromotive force,
divided by the resistance in the circuit. The very
simplicity of this expression is its supreme title to
represent a great discovery in natural science. It is
the men who reach such absolutely simple formulæ for
great fundamental truths that humanity has come, and
rightly, to consider as representing its greatest men in
science.

Like most of the distinguished discoverers in science
who have displayed marked originality, Ohm came
from what is usually called the lower classes, his ancestors
having had to work for their living for as long as
the history of the family can be traced. His father
was a locksmith, and succeeded his father at the trade.
The head of the family for many generations had been
engaged at this handicraft. The first of them of whom
there is any definite record was Ohm's great-grandfather,
Wilhelm Ohm, who was a locksmith at Westerholt,
not far from Münster, in Westphalia. Wilhelm
Ohm's son, Johann Vincent, the grandfather of the great
electrician, during his years as a journeyman locksmith
had spent some time in France, and subsequently settled
down in Kadolzburg, a small suburb of Erlangen, in
Bavaria. In 1764, he obtained the position of locksmith
to the University of Erlangen, and became a citizen of
that municipality. Both of his sons followed the trade
of their father.

The elder of these, Johann Wolfgang, worked at his
trade as a journeyman in a number of the small cities
of Germany, and only after ten years of absence in
what, because of the independent condition of the States
now known as the German Empire, were then considered
foreign parts, did he wander back to his native
place. On his return he received the mastership in his
craft, and shortly after, about 1786, married a young
woman named Beck. George Simon Ohm, the electrical
scientist, was the first child of this marriage, and was
born March 16th, 1789. A second son, born three years
later, also became distinguished in after-life for his
mathematical ability. This younger brother, after
having filled a number of teaching positions in various
German educational institutions, was called as professor
of mathematics to Berlin, where he died in 1862.

While their father, Johann Wolfgang Ohm, followed
his trade of locksmith for a living, like many another
handicraftsman, he had many mental interests which
he cultivated in leisure hours, and doubtless dwelt on
while his hands were occupied with the mere routine
work of his trade. It is curiously interesting to find
that he devoted himself, during the hours he could spare
from his occupation, to two such diverse intellectual occupations
as mathematics and Kant's philosophy; but
they had no newspapers in those days, and a man, even
of the artisan class, had some time for serious mental
occupation. It might be thought, under these circumstances,
that he would be but the most passing of
amateurs in either of these subjects, and have a very
superficial knowledge of them. This probably was true
for his philosophy fad, for there are not many who have
ever thought themselves more than amateurs in Kantism,
and even Kant himself, I believe, thought that only
one scholar ever really understood his system, and
subsequently said he had some doubts even about that
one; but in mathematics, the elder Ohm seems to have
attained noteworthy success.

Hofrath Langsdorff, who was the professor of mathematics
at Erlangen during the last decade of the eighteenth
century, and who was called to Heidelberg in 1804,
a fact that would seem quite enough to set beyond all
question that his opinion in this matter may be taken
as that of a competent judge, declared that the elder
Ohm's mathematical knowledge was far above the ordinary,
and that he knew much more than the elements even
of the higher mathematics. Under these circumstances,
it is not surprising that the father should have tried to
encourage in both his boys a taste for mathematics, nor
that he should have taken their mathematical instruction
into his own hands and succeeded in making excellent
mathematicians of them, even in their early years.
He was so successful in this, indeed, that Langsdorff,
after a five-hour examination of the brothers when they
were respectively 12 and 15, did not hesitate to declare
that the Erlangen locksmith's family was likely to be
remembered as containing a pair of brothers who, for
success in mathematics, might rival the famous Bernoulli
brothers, so well known at that time.

This might be thought only a bit of neighborly praise,
meant to warm a father's heart, yet it seems indeed to
have been given quite seriously. Certainly the event justified
the prophecy. It is not surprising that, with such a
forecast to encourage him, the father should have been
ready to make every sacrifice to enable both his sons to
prepare for the university.

He continued his instruction of them, then, in mathematics,
though he insisted at the same time that they
should continue to keep up their occupation of locksmiths.
In spite of his enthusiasm for mathematics, the
old gentleman seems to have cherished no illusions with
regard to the likelihood of pure mathematics ever serving
them as a lucrative means of livelihood. It was a
very satisfying intellectual interest, but a good trade
was much more apt to prove their constant and substantial
standby, unless, of course, the boys should actually
prove to be the geniuses foretold. He seems to
have realized to the full, Coleridge's idea that, like the
literary man, the mathematician should have some other
occupation, though he might not go to the extent of following
Oliver Wendell Holmes' well-known addition to
Coleridge's formula, that he should, as far as possible,
confine himself to the other occupation. The boys were
given the opportunity to attend the gymnasium of
Erlangen, and seem to have had excellent success in
their general studies besides mathematics.[23]

In 1805, when George, the subject of our sketch, was
sixteen years of age, he was graduated from the gymnasium
and was ready for the university. On May 3d,
1805, he took his matriculation examination before the
faculty of Erlangen, electing the course of mathematics,
physics and philosophy. Later in life he told his friends
that it was his deep love for the mathematics of these
studies, and his persuasion that in them the student was
brought in contact with the most important factors for
absolute intellectual cultivation, that tempted him to
take them up. To this he did not hesitate to add that
there seemed to him to be some call of a higher voice,
as if he had a vocation to dedicate himself to the cultivation
and extension of these important subjects.

He had been but some two years at the university,
when for a time his studies had to be interrupted, partly
for lack of means to pursue them, but partly because
to his father, at least, the university course was not
the source of such satisfaction as he had anticipated
from his son's ability in mathematics. While Ohm took
his studies seriously, he was not by any means a mere
"grind," and, indeed, the reputation which he acquired
at the university for many of the qualities which make
for a student's popularity among his fellows, was not
such as would be likely to appeal to a very serious-minded
father. Ohm had acquired the fame of being
one of the best dancers in the university; he was a brilliant
billiard player and an unrivalled skater; all of
which indicates that as a young man he had the physical
development and acuteness of sense so necessary to
enable him to gain prestige in all these sports.

His father, in spite of his desire for his son's university
career, was quite willing, then, at the end of September,
1808, to have him take up a position as teacher
of mathematics in the school kept by Pastor Zehnder,
in the Canton Berne, in Switzerland. His very youthful
appearance (he was only 18 years of age at the time,
quite boyish looking and not even large for his years)
caused the head of this institution no little surprise when
he came with letters of introduction showing that he
was to be the new teacher in mathematics. He could
scarcely believe his eyes for a time. Within a few
months, however, he was convinced of the ability and
the capacity for work of his new addition to the faculty,
who seems to have given, from the very beginning,
excellent satisfaction in his rather important position.

Ohm remained there some three years and a half and
then moved to Neunberg, where, independent of any
educational institution, he set himself up as a private
tutor in mathematics. His reason for so doing, as he
himself tells, was that he wished to devote himself to
the study of pure mathematics more than was possible
in a regular teaching position. For this same reason
also he refused a number of offers of positions as teacher
of mathematics, which would ordinarily be considered
quite flattering to a young man of only 21. Another
reason for refusing these offers was that he wished to
perfect himself in French, and he had an excellent
opportunity afforded him for conversation in this language
in the conditions in which he was placed in
Neunberg. This last may seem an unusual reason, but
it is characteristic of Ohm's determination always to
add to his power of understanding and expression.

Most young men in Ohm's circumstances are so occupied
with the thought of immediate success in life, that
every possible abbreviation of their studies which will
bring them nearer the opportunity to make their own
living is likely to be heartily welcomed. Ohm, however,
realized that his own intellectual development was more
important, especially at this time, even than getting on
in the world; and for this reason his life has an added
interest, not only for students themselves, but especially
for those who have the best interests of students
at heart and wish to be able to cite examples of how a
little delay in getting at one's actual life-work, or, still
more, at a remunerative occupation, may serve the very
useful purpose of preparing a man so much the better
to bring out his best intellectual possibilities when he
does settle down to his work.

At Easter, 1811, Ohm returned to Erlangen, after
having spent nearly two years perfecting himself in
mathematics. He then finished his studies at the university,
which seems not to have had the rule of requiring
attendance for a definite period before coming
up for its degree, but permitted him to take the examinations
for the doctorate of philosophy on the strength
of the work he had done, and gave him his degree on
the 25th of October of the same year. With the drawing
tighter of the bands of red tape in educational institutions
in more recent years, Ohm would have found it
difficult to get his degree thus readily, though it was the
university rather than the graduate who was eventually
to be honored by it. After this, he became privatdocent
in mathematics at the university, and taught for
three semesters. He met with marked success and
became very popular with the students. After a year
and a half, however, he gave up his university position
to accept the professorship of mathematics at the Realschule
of Bamberg.

While Ohm was here, the spirit of young Germany
awoke at the news of Napoleon's unfortunate Moscow
campaign, in which his good fortune seemed to have
definitely abandoned the great Emperor of the French.
Most of the students of the universities of Germany
were deeply aroused by it, and those who know Körner's
and Uhland's songs will have some idea of the
depth of patriotic feeling that was stirred in thousands
of young German hearts, who thought that now the
opportunity for the fatherland to throw off the hated
foreign yoke forever, had come at last. Ohm debated
with himself whether he should volunteer with the
crowds of young men who were so bravely giving up
everything, that the fatherland might be free. Two
things deterred him. If he went as a soldier, the material
assistance he was able to give his father, and
which, as the old man was now advancing in years and
had spent most of his little savings upon his sons, was
needed, would have to be given up. The other motive
that kept him at home was, according to his German
biographer in the Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie,
which we have been following for most of these details,
because he felt that what he might be able to accomplish
in other fields besides those of battle would eventually
prove more beneficial for his fatherland, and
indeed for the whole of humanity, than anything he
could do as a soldier, even with the patriotic motive to
help his country to throw off the yoke of the foreign
usurper, which had proven so hard to bear. As we
have already seen, it was a characteristic trait of Ohm
all through life, that he cherished the idea, which
acquired almost the force of a premonition, that he was
destined for great things.

Ohm continued his work as a teacher, then, instead of
volunteering for the army; but, as might be expected,
found the monotonous work of drilling young students
in mathematics extremely unsatisfactory after a time.
At the end of a year and a half of service at Bamberg,
he asked for a change in the conditions of his teaching
position. Instead of this, he received a transfer to the
Bamberg pro-gymnasium, where he was to teach Latin
until a regular teacher was appointed. In spite of his
representations that the teaching position offered him
was utterly at variance with his talents and his inclinations,
he was compelled to accept this occupation for a
time, though after some delay there came the assurance
that, just as soon as possible, he would be assigned to a
position as teacher of mathematics.

In spite of his unfortunate circumstances, which
would ordinarily be thought quite enough to keep him
from serious work until he was settled in a position
more suited to his tastes, he devoted himself to the
writing of his first book during this time, and it was
published by Enke, in Erlangen, in the spring of 1817.
Its title was, "Outlines of the Study of Geometry as a
Means of Intellectual Culture." It comprised nearly two
hundred pages, and gives the best possible insight into
the ability and intelligence of the author, then a young
man of only twenty-eight. As a sort of appendix, he
gives a short sketch of his father, evidently introduced,
not quite so much for the purpose of filially confessing
his obligations to the old locksmith mathematician, nor
with the idea of repaying some of his immeasurable
debt for all the opportunities which the sacrifices of
paternal affection had brought into the life of his sons, as
to emphasize the excellent educational influence which
his father's mathematical training had had upon his
boys, and thus prove his thesis as to the value of mathematical
studies in education. Few filial tributes were
ever more deserved or given more convincingly or with
less suggestion of the conventional attitude of son to
father.

Now that mathematics has come to occupy probably
even a less prominent place in education than it did in
Ohm's time, though the burden of his complaint with
regard to educational methods was that geometry was
not used as a daily developmental subject as much as it
should be, it may be interesting to recall some of the
reasons which he advanced for urging its greater employment
as an instrument for mental training. He
thought that rational geometry should occupy a place
of honor among our means of education. Its quality as
a mode of pure reasoning, though so closely related to
the senses, made easy the transition from sensation to
thought, which is such an important element in education;
while its eminently simple character, though combined
with definite demands upon the constructive
faculties, made it appropriate in a high degree for the education
of the young out of the field of merely imitative
use of the intellect, into that of independent thinking
and following out of ideas. "Geometry," says Ohm,
"when properly taught, not with the fruitless
drilling usually employed in teaching it, but in such
ways as to secure deep personal attention, must take
rank above all other branches of education, in enabling
the student to break down the barrier which separates
mere understanding from personal investigation. It
forces a man whose thoughts were, up to this time,
only the repetition of others' thoughts, to think for himself
and to light for himself in his own mind the torches
which enable him to see things clearly for himself, and
not merely in the dimness of the half light that is thrown
on them by the explanations of others."

Geometrical methods always had a special fascination
for Ohm, and practically all of his books and writings
bear the impress of that close dependence of all parts
on one another, that absolutely logical connection so
characteristic of geometric accuracy of thought. His
was the sort of mind likely to be benefited by mathematical
training. Such minds are, however, comparatively
few, for most men are not rational in any sense
of the word, that would make them dependent on
logical reasoning. Perhaps it is as well that they are
not, for many of those lacking in logic or mathematical
accuracy of thought and absoluteness of conclusion,
still continue to accomplish much in the world of thought
and do much valuable planning for the complexities of
human affairs, where strict logic will not always solve
the intricate yet incomplete problems that present
themselves in human relations, where, indeed, individual
unknown factors often make any but an approximate
solution impossible.

The opinions of the critics as to Ohm's "Outlines of
Geometry" were, as might be easily anticipated, not all
flattering, since only a few of the critics were able to
place themselves on the ideal standpoint of mathematical
subjectivity from which he had written his book.
King Frederick William III., of Prussia, is said to have
read it with much interest, however, and the royal
pleasure doubtless drew attention to Ohm's work, and
may have contributed to the fact that, shortly after its
publication, in September, 1817, Ohm was invited by
the Royal Consistory of Cologne to take the position of
head professor of mathematics and physics in the
gymnasium of that city. This post was not only honorable,
it was also highly remunerative, at least from the
standpoint of teachers' wages as they were at that time,
and Ohm eagerly accepted the position.

Lamont, who was the director of the Royal Observatory
at Munich, has written a memorial of Ohm which
contains much valuable information. The body of it is
an address delivered at a meeting of the Faculty of the
University of Munich in honor of Thaddeus Siber and
George Simon Ohm, but its value has been much enhanced
by notes added before publication. Siber was a
Benedictine who was professor in the philosophical
department at Munich, and died the same year as Ohm.
Lamont says that he received his information as to
intimate details of Ohm's life from his brother, Prof.
Martin Ohm, of Berlin. His sketch is, therefore, absolutely
authoritative. Lamont says with regard to this
period of teaching at Cologne: "Ohm's first position
of importance, in any way worthy of his talents, was
the professorship of mathematics at the large Jesuit
gymnasium in Cologne, in 1817, where the special gift
that he possessed, of making the study of mathematics
not only comprehensible but attractive to boys, brought
him success and recognition."

For nearly ten years Ohm had the opportunity to put
into practice in this Jesuit gymnasium of the Rhineland,
the principles which he had so much at heart, for he was
apparently given the full freedom of his department of
teaching. He succeeded so well that he received wide
and hearty recognition for his work. The mathematical
studies of the Cologne gymnasium stood higher than
had ever been the case before, and this was all Ohm's
work. In the years before his teaching in the Rhenish
city, those who were distinguished in mathematics at
the University of Bonn had not come, as a rule, from
Cologne, but from other places; but now nearly all the
mathematical prize-takers of Bonn came from among
Ohm's students, and the best of the candidates for
teaching positions in physics and mathematics had also,
as a rule, had the advantages of his training.

Among the best of his scholars at this time was the
afterwards well-known mathematician, Lejeune-Dirichlet,
who taught in Berlin with Jacobi and Steiner and
succeeded Gauss in Göttingen. Another of his most
distinguished pupils was the astronomer Heis, who occupied
a modest position at the Munster Academy, but
whose merits were above the post which he occupied,
and who was distinguished for the excellency of his
original work and his ability as a mathematician. One
very interesting fact with regard to Ohm's teaching,
was that he was successful in catching and holding the
interest not only of those of his students who were
later to specialize in mathematics, but also of those who
took up mathematics only as a subject for mental development,
that was to be applied to other purposes
later in life, and who found Ohm's teaching of the
greatest possible service. Among these, the well-known
German literary man, Jacob Venedey, of Cologne, has
expressed his affection and gratitude for his old teacher
in a very striking way in his sketch of the cathedral at
Cologne, written in the banishment that came to so
many vigorous German thinkers after the failure of the
revolution of '48. In sending a copy of this to Ohm,
Venedey says: "Honored Sir:       It will perhaps be a
source of wonder to you that a student who apparently
learned so little from you and your colleagues that he
must now earn his bread by writing, should continue
to cherish for you the liveliest gratitude. It is not the
fault of mathematics that only the dimmest recollection
of them remains with me. I shall never forget the
personality of my professor, however, nor his ways and
methods of teaching. I frequently recount your way
with us boys, and I have the liveliest remembrance of
your influence as a teacher. There are seldom weeks,
there never is a month, when I fail to recall you. This
is no mere compliment that I am paying to you, since I
know you too well to think that flattery would mean
anything to you, as it would be unworthy of you, and
I for my part am not one of those who like to bandy
compliments. I have often wished to meet you again,
and a hundred times I thought that I saw you because
some one at a distance had something that recalled you.
I may say to you that you accomplished something for
me in those days of teaching that I would not have been
able to accomplish for myself. I can only think of you,
then, with the highest feelings of reverence approaching
what might well be called love. It will be a happy day,
indeed, for me if I am ever in a position to make an
hour of existence happier for you in any way."

While Ohm so zealously continued his instruction in
both the upper classes of the gymnasium, he never lost
from sight that higher aim of original research and
investigation to which his genius disposed him.

His choice of a subject for original investigation wavered
for a long time between mathematics and physics,
but, as he himself declared, his experience having
shown him that authority was prone to play a large role
in mathematics, while the field was more open for
personal research and observation in physics, he resolved
to take up that department for his special studies, consoled
by the idea that physics cannot be properly pursued
without mathematics. Looking around to select a
subject that would serve as a striking preface to his
work in this department, though resolved at the same
time to avoid one where he would be without rivalry, he
found it all ready to his hand in what one of his contemporaries
called the enigmatic phenomena of the
galvanic current. This was to prove a fortunate selection,
indeed, both for himself and the opportunity
afforded his genius as well as for the science of electricity
itself.

He then began a series of investigations, always experimental
in character, and with the mathematical explanations
of the phenomena observed carefully worked
out. Accounts of these studies appeared from time to
time in the year-book for Chemistry and Physics, issued
by Schweigger. After some ten years, these were collected
together, or at least the principal portions of
them, and published in the second half of the year-book
for the year 1826. The apparatus for his experiments
was fortunately at command in the gymnasium at
Cologne, but without his mechanical skill, obtained from
his experience as a locksmith when a boy, it would have
been impossible so to vary his experiments and modify
his instruments as to bring out many of the phenomena
that he succeeded in demonstrating. Nearly all of the
great discoverers in science have been handy men possessed
of mechanical skill, and this is as true for medicine,
as I have shown in "Makers of Modern Medicine,"[24]
though it might perhaps not be expected, as it is
here in electricity, where it seems very natural.

Ohm felt, in 1826, that he had succeeded in exhausting
nearly all that he could learn for himself, and as he
wished to have opportunities for further study, and
especially for further reading, he asked for an academic
furlough that would carry him over the next year. The
work that he had already accomplished was beginning
to be appreciated, and after discussion of the papers
that he had published up to that time, the requested
furlough was promptly granted; and in a letter in which
the school authorities praised his school work as well
as his original investigations, they allowed him to take
the sabbatic year for the furtherance of science on one-half
the usual salary, though with the condition also
that more would be allowed to him in case this seemed
necessary and the conditions justified it.

This furlough was perhaps the most important event
in Ohm's life. He employed it in bringing to a focus
the ideas with regard to electricity which had been
gradually worked out in his mind during the past ten
years. In May, 1827, within six months after the beginning
of his exclusive devotion to the subject, Ohm's
article on the mathematics of the galvanic current
appeared. It proved a scientific achievement of the
first rank, that was to be epoch-making in the domain
of electricity. It settled the conditions under which
electrical tension exists in various bodies, and made
it clear that there is a fundamental law of electrical
conduction which could be expressed by an easy, simple
formula.

Ohm's preface to his little book, that was to work
such a revolution in electricity and was to remain for all
time one of the classics in this department of science, is
typical of the man in many ways. Its modesty could not
very well be exceeded. Its simplicity constitutes in itself
an appeal to the reader's interest. I know nothing in
the literature of the history of science quite like it in
these regards, unless it be the preface of Auenbrugger's
little book on percussion, in which he laid the foundation
of modern clinical diagnosis.[25] The two men have many
more qualities in common than the authorship of modest
prefaces to their books. Both of them were geniuses
whose names the aftertime will not willingly let die, and
both of them accomplished their work apart from the
stream of university life in their time, and met with a
like fate in the neglect, for some time at least, by their
distinguished colleagues of the important discoveries
that they had made. Ohm's preface deserves to be
quoted because of its classic quality:

"I herewith present to the public a theory of galvanic
electricity as a special part of electrical science in general,
and shall successively, as time, inclination and
means permit, arrange more such portions together into
a whole, if this first essay shall in some degree repay
the sacrifice it has cost me. The circumstances in
which I have hitherto been placed have not been suitable
either to encourage me in the pursuit of novelties
or to enable me to become acquainted with works relating
to the same department of literature throughout
its whole extent. I have, therefore, chosen for my
first attempt a department of science in which I have
the least to apprehend competition.

"May the well-disposed reader accept whatever I
have accomplished with the same love for science as
that with which it is sent forth!       The Author, Berlin,
May 1st, 1827."

In his preface to the American edition of the
"Galvanic Circuit Investigated Mathematically,"[26] Mr.
Thomas D. Lockwood, vice-president of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers, said of this masterpiece
of Ohm's: "A sufficient reason for republishing
an English translation of the wonderful book of Professor
G. S. Ohm is the difficulty with which the only
previous translation (that of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs)
is procurable.

"Besides this, however, the intrinsic value of the
book is so great that it should be read by all electricians
who care for more than superficial knowledge.

"It is most remarkable to note, at this time, how
completely Ohm stated his famous law that the electromotive
force divided by the resistance is equal to the
strength of the current."

With regard to the book as a whole, Mr. Lockwood
says, after suggesting certain anticipations of Ohm's
ideas which had been made in the preceding century:
"Ohm's work stands alone, and, reading it at the present
time, one is filled with wonder at the prescience,
respect for his patience and prophetic soul, and admiration
of the immensity and variety of ground covered by
his little book, which is indeed his best monument."

Like many another great discovery in physical science,
Ohm's work failed to receive the immediate appreciation
which it deserved. It cannot be said, however, that it
failed to attract attention. It would be easier, indeed,
to forgive the scientists of the day if this were true.
Not long after its appearance, abstracts from it were
made by Fechner in Leipzig, by Pfaff in Erlangen,
and Poggendorff in Berlin, which showed that these
scientists understood very clearly the significance and
comprehended the wide application of Ohm's law as
claimed by its author. From these men there was no
question of hostile criticism. Professor Pohl, of the
University of Berlin, however, in the Berlin "Year-book
of Scientific Criticism," did not hesitate to express his
utter disagreement, and declared that Ohm's work was
fallacious and should be rejected. Other writers of the
time treated Ohm's article more or less indifferently, as
a merely conventional contribution to science.

Professor Pohl's opinion was taken to represent the
conclusions of the faculty of the University of Berlin,
especially noted for mathematical ability. This was to
prove a serious hindrance to Ohm in the university
career which he had planned for himself. At Berlin
they had the ear of the Minister of Education, and it
was not long before Ohm felt that the criticisms of his
work were making themselves felt in a direction unfavorable
to him. Not long after the appearance of his
book, there came a disagreement between Ohm and the
educational authorities. Ohm felt that this was due to
failure to recognize the significance of his work, and
that under the circumstances he could not hope for the
appreciation that would provide him with the opportunities
he deserved. He insisted on sending in his
resignation as a teacher. Nothing could change his
determination in the matter, not even the pleas of his
former scholars, and his resignation had to be accepted.

Ohm had hoped for a teaching position in a university.
The Minister of Education declared that, while his
work as a teacher had been accomplished with careful
industry and diligence and conscientious attention to
duty, the ministry regretted that, in spite of thorough
appreciation of him and admiration for his excellent
work as a scientist, they could not find for him a position
outside of the gymnasium. How utterly trivial the
conventional expressions sound, now that we know that
they brought about for the time being the interruption
of one of the most brilliant scientific careers in Europe.
Of course, the geese cannot be expected to appreciate
the swans, and it was not the minister's fault, but that
of some of Ohm's own colleagues. The next six years
of his life, the precious years between 38 and 44, Ohm
had to give up the idea of teaching in a university, and
devote himself to some private tutoring in Berlin, with
a stipend of about three hundred dollars a year, miserable
enough, yet sufficient, as would appear, for Ohm's
simple mode of life. This he owed to the kindness of
Gen. Radowitz, who employed him to teach mathematics
in a military school in Berlin.

At the end of this time, when he was nearly 45 years
of age, his unfortunate situation attracted the attention
of King Ludwig I., of Bavaria, who offered him the
chair of professor of physics at the Polytechnic School
in Nuremberg, which had recently by royal rescript
been raised to the status of a Royal Institute, with the
same rank in educational circles as a lyceum for the
study of humanities. Here Ohm's duties were shortly
to be multiplied. He became the inspector of scientific
instruction, after having occupied for some time the
professorship of mathematics, and later became the
rector of the Polytechnic School, a position which he
held for some ten years, fulfilling its duties with the
greatest conscientiousness and fidelity.

Ohm continued his work at Nuremberg for more than
fifteen years. During this time, he succeeded in making
his mark in every one of the departments of physics.
He is usually considered as owing his reputation as an
experimental and mathematical scientist to his researches
in electricity. As a matter of fact, every
branch of physics was illuminated by his work, and
perhaps nothing shows the original genius of the man
better than the fact that everything which he took up
revealed new scientific aspects in his hands. The only
wonder is that he should have remained so long in
a subordinate position in the educational world at Nuremberg,
and received his appointment as university
professor of physics at Munich only in 1849.

In the midst of the administrative educational work
that came to him at Nuremberg, Ohm did not neglect
original investigation, but somehow succeeded in finding
time for experiment and study. Having made a
cardinal discovery in electricity, of the value of which
surely no one was more aware than himself, Ohm
might have been expected, as soon as his new post
gave him the opportunity, to devote himself quite exclusively
to this department of science. Instead, he
turned for a time to the related subjects of sound, heat
and light, devoting himself especially to their mathematics.
He did this, as he said himself, to complete for
his own satisfaction his knowledge of the scientific
foundations of the imponderables, as heat, light and
electricity were then called, but also because he wished,
for the sake of his students, to get closely in touch
with what had been accomplished by recent investigators
in physics.

It is almost a universal rule in science, that no matter
how distinguished an investigator may be, he makes
but one cardinal discovery. Ohm, however, was destined,
after having brilliantly illuminated electricity by
the discovery of a great law, to throw nearly as bright
a light on the domain of acoustics; and there is a
law in this department of physics which is deservedly
called by his name, though it is often associated with
that of Helmholtz. Helmholtz himself was always
most emphatic in his insistence on Ohm's priority in
the matter, and constantly speaks of the law in question
by Ohm's name.

Perhaps no better evidence of the breadth of Ohm's
interest in science, his supreme faculty for experimentation,
or the originality of his investigating genius,
can be found than the fact that he thus discovered,
by experimental and mathematical methods, the solution
to important problems in two such distinct departments
of physical science as electricity and acoustics.
Before his time, the question of electrical resistance
was absolutely insoluble. The problem in acoustics
was not less obscure, as may be judged from the fact
that, though some of the best physicists and mathematicians
of Europe during the eighteenth century       and
there were giants in those days, among others, Brook
Taylor in England, D'Alembert in France, Johann
Bernoulli and Euler in Germany, and finally, Daniel
Bernoulli       had devoted themselves to its solution, it
remained nevertheless unsolved. Here, as in electricity,
the simplicity of the solution which Ohm found
shows how direct were his methods of thinking and
how thorough his modes of investigation. Perhaps
the most striking feature of Ohm's work in acoustics,
and, above all, his solution of an important problem in
music, is the fact that he himself, unlike most of his
German compatriots, had no ear for music and no liking
for it.

In his address delivered at the public meeting of the
Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences at Munich, in
March, 1889, the hundredth anniversary of the birth
of Ohm, Eugene Lommel, in discussing the scientific
work of Ohm, said: "Inasmuch as his law in acoustics
furnished the clearest insight into the hitherto incomprehensible
nature of musical tones, it dominates the
acoustics of to-day no less completely than Ohm's law
of the electric current dominates the science of electricity."[27]
This law concerns the resolution of tones
into their constituents. The ideas laid down by Ohm
were almost absolutely novel. They were so new that
none of the workers in acoustics could think that Ohm
had made a great discovery. His law states that the
human ear perceives only pendulum-like vibration as a
simple tone. Every other periodic motion it resolves
into a collection of pendulum-like vibrations, which it
then hears in the sound as a series of single tones,
fundamentals and overtones. Ohm arrived at this law
from mathematical considerations, making use of Fourier's
series; for its experimental verification he was
compelled to use the well-cultivated ear of a friend,
inasmuch as he was himself, as we have said, quite
devoid of musical appreciation.

Ohm's results were too distant from the accustomed
ideas of investigators of sound at that time to be accepted
by them. Seebeck, who was one of the most
prominent scientists of the time in acoustics, did not
hesitate to criticise severely, just as Pohl had made
little of Ohm's law of the electric current. While,
however, foreigners were to teach German scientists the
value of the advance that their great colleague in electricity
had made, the privilege of pointing out the significance
of his work in sound was to be a compatriot's
good fortune. It was nearly a score of years, however,
before this vindication was to take place. Then Helmholtz,
a decade after Ohm's death, furnished the experimental
means which enabled even the unskilled ear to
resolve a sound into its simple partial tones, and revolutionized
the theory of music by his classic work, "The
Science of the Perception of Sound," which is based entirely
on Ohm's law of acoustics.

Ohm, in the appendix to his work, "The Galvanic Circuit
treated mathematically," dared to suggest certain
speculations with regard to the ultimate structure of
matter. He said: "There are properties of space-filling
matter which we are accustomed to look upon as belonging
to it. There are other properties which heretofore
we have been inclined to look upon as accidents or
guests of matter, which abide with it from time to
time. For these properties man has thought out causes,
if not foreign, at least extrinsic, and they pass as immaterial
independent phases of nature under the names
light, heat, electricity, etc. It must be possible so to
conceive the structure of physical bodies that, along
with the properties of the first class, at the same time
and necessarily those of the second shall be given."

It is all the more interesting to come upon Ohm's
speculations on this subject of the ultimate constitution
of matter, because within a few years of his time, Pasteur,
then only a comparatively young man, had also
been taken with the idea of getting at the constitution
of matter by his observations upon dissymmetry, which
he abandoned after a time, however, because he found
other and more practical subjects to devote himself to,
though he never gave up the thought that he might
some time return to them and perhaps discover the
underlying principles of matter from observations in this
subject. It was not until the last five years of his life,
when Ohm was already past sixty, that he was to enjoy
the satisfaction of an ambition which he had cherished
from his earliest years as a teacher, and which,
in spite of untoward circumstances, had been a precious
stimulus in his work. For some twenty years
he had hoped some time to be able to devote himself
to the investigation of the physical constitution of
matter. Unfortunately, when the opportunity came, the
manifold duties of his teaching position prevented the
completion of his great work, and doubtless robbed his
generation and ours of a precious heritage in the mathematics
of the structure of matter, which would doubtless
have been of the greatest possible value.

It is of course idle to speculate as to what he might have
accomplished if left to his original investigation. The
problem which he now took up was much more difficult
than any of his preceding tasks. It would have seemed,
however, quite as hopeless to those who lived before
Ohm's laws, to look for a single complete law of the resistance
of the electrical current in the circuit or of
the overtones in music, as it is to us to think of a simple
mathematical formula for atomic relations. What Ohm
accomplished in these other cases by his wonderful
power of eliminating all the unnecessary factors in the
problem, would surely have helped him here. The main
power of genius, after all, is its faculty of eliminating
the superfluous, which always obscures the real question
at issue to such a degree for ordinary minds, that they
are utterly unable to see even the possibility of a simple
solution of it. Art has been defined as the elimination
of the superfluous; discovery in science might well be
defined in the same terms. Under the circumstances,
we cannot help regretting that Ohm was not allowed
the time and the opportunity to work out the thoughts
with which he was engaged. It would have been even
more satisfactory if the precious years of his ripe middle
age had not been wasted in trivial, conventional
tasks, so that he might have been permitted to devote
his academic leisure, sooner than was actually the case,
to the problem which had been so constantly in mind
since he made his great generalization in the laws of
electricity.

Unfortunately, most of Ohm's time had now to be
taken up with his teaching duties. Only for his self-sacrifice
in the matter, his success as a teacher would
doubtless have been less marked. Science itself must
have suffered, however, from this pre-occupation of
mind with a round of conventional duties, since Ohm
could no longer devote his time to original research. In
the meantime, his great discovery was coming to its
own. During these ten years since the publication of
his book, a number of distinguished physicists in every
country       Poggendorff, and especially Fechner, in Germany,
Jacobi and Lenz in Russia, Henry in America,
Rosenkoeld in Sweden, and De Heer in Holland       took
up the problems of the current strength of electricity
as set forth in Ohm's law, and confirmed his conclusion
by their investigations along similar lines. The French
physicist and member of the Academy of Sciences,
Pouillet, applied Ohm's ideas to thermo-electricity and
pyro-electricity, employing his terms and bringing his
work to the notice of foreigners generally, so that a
translation of Ohm's work was made into English.

Ohm's work at once attracted the attention that it
deserved in England. The Royal Society conferred
on him the Copley Medal, which had been founded
as a reward for important discoveries in the domain
of natural knowledge. Before Ohm's time only one
other German scientist, Carl Friedrich Gauss, of Göttingen,
had ever been thus honored. The words employed
by the Royal Society in conferring this distinction
showed how thoroughly the representatives of English
science appreciated Ohm's work. They said that
he had set forth the laws of the electric current very
clearly, and thus accomplished the solution of a problem
which was as important in the realm of applied science
as it had hitherto been in the schools. Recognition
now became the rule, and Ohm had the satisfaction of
having all his colleagues in the physical sciences acknowledge
the significance of his work.

Ohm's recognition, then, came from foreigners first,
and only afterwards from his fellow-countrymen. Immediate
appreciation might have meant much for him,
and even this tardy recognition gave him renewed
courage and new strength to go on with his work.
He gave effective expression at once to his gratitude
and to the stimulus that had been afforded him by the
dedication to the Royal Society of London of the great
work, "Contributions to molecular Physics," which he
planned.

The year after he received the Copley Medal, he was
made a Foreign Associate of the Royal Society of
England, and from this time on his discoveries began to
find their way into text-books as fundamental doctrines
in the science of electricity. German and foreign scientific
bodies followed the English example so happily
set for them, and began to give him their recognition
as a physicist of the first rank. Ohm's further observations
were, for a time, not accepted so readily as
his first law. The reason for this was that Ohm was so
far ahead of his times that there was not as yet in existence
a suitable electroscope to test their truth. Finally,
the invention of an exact electrometer by Dellman, and
its application by Professor Kohlrausch, of Marburg,
made the experimental confirmation of all his work
quite as significant as for his law.

It is a striking reflection on Ohm's career, though not
very encouraging for the discoverer in science, to realize
that some important discoveries, which thus proved
eventually quite as epoch-making as his law, had lain
for practically ten years neglected, and their magnificently
endowed author had been allowed to eke
out a rather difficult existence in teaching, not in the
important department of science in which he was so
great a master, but in certain conventional phases of
mathematics which might very well have been taught
by almost anyone who knew the elements of higher
mathematics. Ohm's case is not a solitary phenomenon
in the history of science, however, but rather follows
the rule, that a genuine novelty is seldom welcomed by
the leaders of science at any given moment; but, on the
contrary, rather decried, and its discoverer always
frigidly put in his proper place by those who resent his
audacity in presuming to teach them something new in
their own science.

Having thus illuminated electricity and acoustics,
Ohm turned his attention to the department of optics.
His power to simplify difficulties and get at the heart of
obscure problems is illustrated by his contribution to
this subject, made while he was professor of physics
in the University of Munich. Optics had early engaged
his attention, and in 1840 he published a paper in Poggendorff's
Annalen, bearing the title, "A Description
of some simple and easily managed Arrangements for
making the Experiment of the Interference of Light."
With his usual faculty for simplifying things, he showed
that the interference prisms which were made so carefully
by the French could be constructed from common
plate-glass. He was indeed able to demonstrate that a
simple strip from the edge of a piece of such glass could
be used for this purpose.

He pursued this absorbing subject until 1852-53, and
then set himself the difficult task of developing a general
theory of these phenomena of interference which
are so rich in form and color. The problem was indeed
alluring, but some of the best minds in nineteenth
century science in Europe had been engaged at it, without
bringing much order out of the chaos, and it would
have looked quite unpromising to anyone but Ohm, to
whom, the greater the difficulty of a subject, the more
the attraction it possessed. With his wonderful power
of synthesis and his capacity to discover a clue to the
way through a maze of difficulties, Ohm succeeded in
finding a formula of great simplicity and beauty and
which covered all the individual colors. It was only
after he had reached his conclusions and was actually
publishing his results, that the German scientist found
that he had been anticipated by Professor Langberg, of
Christiania, in Norway, with regard to the principal
points of his investigation, though not as to all its details.
Professor Langberg[28] had published his article in
the Norwegian Magazine for Natural Sciences in 1841,
and an abstract of it had appeared the following year
in the first complementary volume (Erganzungsband)
of Poggendorff's Annalen.

Of this publication by Professor Langberg, Ohm had
known absolutely nothing. He had even gone to some
pains to find out, before undertaking his own investigation,
whether anything had been published on the
matter. At the sessions of the German Naturalists'
Association, held in 1852, he had called the attention of
many prominent physicists and mineralogists who were
present at that meeting to the colored concentric ellipses
which occur in connection with certain crystals used in
the investigation of polarization. He asked whether
these had ever been seen before, or whether anything
had been written about them. All of those whom he
consulted declared that they had not observed them,
and that, so far as they knew, nothing had been
published with regard to them. Accordingly, Ohm proceeded
with his work, only to find, after its formal
publication, that he had been almost entirely anticipated
and that the merit of original discovery belonged
to his Norwegian colleague.

When his attention was called to the publication,
Ohm was perfectly ready to acknowledge the priority
of Professor Langberg's claim and to give him all
the credit that belonged to his discovery. At the
beginning of the second part of his article, he said:

"I know not whether I should consider it lucky or
unlucky that the extremely meritorious work of Langberg
should have entirely escaped me and should have
been lost to general recollection. Certain it is that, if
I had had any knowledge of it before, my present
investigations, which were occasioned by this elliptical
system, would not have been made and I would have
been spared a deal of work. In that case, however, a
number of other and scarcely less important scientific
principles would have remained hidden for the time
being at least. Under the circumstances, the profound
truth of the old proverb, 'Man proposes, but God disposes,'
has been brought home to me again. What
originally set me investigating this subject now proves
to be without interest for science, since the problem has
been solved before. On the other hand, a number of
things of which I had no hint at all at the beginning of
my researches, have come to take its place and compensate
for it."

Perhaps nothing will show better than this, Ohm's
disposition toward that Providence which overrules
everything, and somehow, out of the mixture of good
and evil in life, accomplishes things that make for the
great purpose of creation. His eminently inquiring
attitude towards science, which had on three occasions
led him to tackle problems that had puzzled the greatest
of experimental scientists, has been shown. He must
have been, above all things, a man of a scientific turn
of mind, in the sense that he was not ready to accept
what had previously been accepted even by distinguished
authorities in science, but was ready to look for
new clews that would lead him to simpler explanations
than any that had been offered before. In spite of this
inquiring disposition, so eminently appropriate to the
scientist, and constituting the basis of his success as
an experimenter and scientific synthesist, he seems to
have no doubts about the old explanation of the creation
nor the all-wise directing power of a Divine Providence.
This is all the more interesting, because already
the materialistic view of things, which claims to
know nothing except what can be learned from the
matter around us, had begun to make its way in Europe,
especially in scientific circles, but Ohm remained untouched
by it.

Another example of this same state of mind in Ohm
is to be found in the preface to his last great work, his
contribution to molecular physics, in which he hoped
to sum up all that he could discover and demonstrate
mathematically with regard to the constitution of matter.
He knew that he was taking up a work that would
require many years and much laborious occupation of
mind. He realized, too, that his duties as professor of
physics and mathematics as well as the directorship of
the museum and the consultancy to the department of
telegraphs, left him comparatively little time for the
work. He foresaw that he might not be able to finish
it, yet hoped against hope that he would. In the preface
to the first volume, he declared that he would devote
himself to it at every possible opportunity, and that he
hoped that God would spare him to complete it. This
simplicity of confidence in the Almighty is indeed a
striking characteristic of the man.

The work which Ohm began thus with such humble
trust in God, was to contain his conclusions concerning
the nature, size, form and mode of action of the atom,
with the idea of being able to deduce, by the aid of
analytical mechanics, all the phenomena of matter. Unfortunately,
he was spared only to write the first, an introductory
volume which bears the title, "Elements of
the analytical geometry of space on a system of oblique
co-ordinates." This did not touch, as he confesses, the
ultimate problem he had in mind. The second volume
was to have contained the dynamics of the structures
of bodies, and a third and fourth were to be devoted to
the physical investigation of the atom and its relation
to other atoms and matter in general.

Ohm devoted himself, however, with too much ardor
to his duties as teacher, to allow himself to give the
time to his own work that would have enabled him to finish
it. Among other things that he did for his students
was to complete a text-book of physics. He confesses
that he had always felt an aversion to working at a
text-book, and yet was impelled to take up the task because
he felt that in electricity, in sound and in optics,
the only way in which his students would get his ideas,
many of which were the result of his own work, was to
have a text-book by himself, and he felt bound in duty
to do this for them, as he had accepted the position of
instructor. He succeeded in completing the book very
rapidly by lithographing his lectures immediately after
delivery and distributing copies to his classes.

It is almost needless to say that the work was, in its
way, thoroughly original. It was accomplished with
the ease with which he was always able to do things;
but, unfortunately, the strain of the work told on him
at his years much more than when, as a younger man,
he was able to work without fatigue. He acknowledges,
at the close of the preface, that the task has been too
great, and that he should not have undertaken its accomplishment,
and especially not in the hasty way in
which it was done. This preface was dated Easter,
1854. Within a few months, Ohm's strength began to
fail, and the end was not long in coming.

According to the translation of the address of Lommel,
as it appeared in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian
Institute for 1851, Ohm died as the result of
repeated attacks of epilepsy, on July 6th, 1854. The
date is correct; the mode of death, however, is surely
reported under a misunderstanding. The physician
who hears of epilepsy is prone at once to inquire as to
its origin, and to wonder how long the patient had been
suffering from it. There are no reports of previous
attacks of epilepsy, and the sudden development of
genuine epilepsy in fatal form at the age of 65 is quite
unlikely.

His German biographer, Bauernfeind, who is quoted
by Lommel as one of the authorities for the details of
Ohm's life, and who was a pupil and intimate friend,
gives quite a different account. Up to the very last
day of his life, Ohm continued his lectures. His duties
as professor appealed to his conscience as no others.
On Thursday, July 6th, 1854, he delivered his last lecture.
That night at ten o'clock he died. The cause of his
death was given as a repeated apopleptic stroke. It is
evidently because of the occurrence of more apopleptic
seizures than one, that the assertion of epilepsy was
introduced unto the account of his death.

For some days before his death, Ohm had been very
weak, but had continued to fulfil every duty. To us in
the modern time, it may seem surprising that there
should be lectures in a university in July; but the second
semester of the university year in Germany is not
supposed to come to a close until the first of August,
when the summer vacation begins, and lectures are
continued until well on into July. The manner of Ohm's
death, as told by his biographer friend, at once corrects
the idea of epilepsy, and also shows that his passing
came without any of the preliminary suffering that
makes death a real misfortune. A half hour before his
death, he had been entertaining some friends with
lively recollections of the events of his early life in Cologne
and Treves. He had been quite gay in the stories
that he told, and almost boyishly happy in the recollections
of those early days. For one for whom duty had
meant so much in life, and who had always tried so faithfully
to fulfil it, no happier call to higher things could
possibly be imagined than that which came to Ohm.

On the following Sunday he was followed to the grave
by numbers of friends, by all his colleagues and by most
of the students of the Munich University. The university
felt that it had suffered a great loss, and no signs
of its grief were felt to be too much. Ohm was buried
in the old Munich graveyard, where his bones still rest,
beneath the simple memorial not unworthy of the modest
scientist who did his work patiently and quietly, yet
with never-failing persistency; who cared not for the
applause of the multitude, and accomplished so much
quite independently of any of the ordinary helps from
others and from great educational institutions that are
often supposed to be almost indispensably necessary
for the accomplishment of original scientific work.

Ohm's personal appearance will be of interest to
many of those to whom his discoveries have made him
appeal as one of the great original thinkers in modern
science. He was almost small in stature, even below
middle height; and those who remember Virchow, may
get something of an idea of his appearance when told
that those who saw Ohm and knew Virchow, considered
that there was a certain reminder of each other in the
two men. According to his intimate friend and biographer,
he had a very expressive face, with a high,
somewhat doubled forehead. His eyes were deep and
full of intelligence. His mouth, very sharply defined,
betrayed, at the first glance, at once the earnest thinker
and the pleasant man of friendly disposition. He was
always restful and never seemed to be distracted. He
talked but little, but his conversation was always interesting,
and, except when he was in some particularly
serious mood, was always likely to have a vein of light
humor in it. He did not hesitate to introduce a sparkle
of wit now and then into his lectures, and especially knew
how gently to make fun of mistakes made by his pupils,
yet in such a way as not to hurt their feelings, but to
make them realize the necessity for more careful thought
before giving answers, and for appreciating principles
before speculating on them. He was particularly careful
not to do anything that would offend his students
in any way, and it is to this care that the success of his
method of teaching has been especially attributed.

His habits of life were from the beginning of his
career simple, and they continued to be so until the end.
He was never married, and he himself attributed this
to the unfavorable condition of his material resources at
the beginning of his career as a teacher, and the fact
that the improvement in these did not really come until
he was well past fifty years of age. He once confessed
to a friend that he missed those modest pleasures of
family life which do so much to give courage and
strength for the greater as well as the lesser sufferings
of life. Most of his years of teaching he spent in
boarding houses. Only after his appointment to the
professorship at Munich was he able to have a dwelling
for himself, which was presided over by a near relative.

Ohm is remembered as a teacher rather than as an
educational administrator. His pupils recall him as one
who was able to be eminently suggestive, while at the
same time he succeeded in making it easy to acquire the
details of information. The didactic lecture, as a method
of teaching, did not appeal to him, and his success was
due to the application of quite other methods. He
realized how much personal influence meant, and the
peculiarity of his system of teaching was an almost
uninterrupted lively personal intercourse with his pupils.
Demonstrations and exercises at the board always occupied
the first half of his two-hour lesson, and only the
other half was devoted to the setting forth of new
matter. In this way, Ohm succeeded not only in influencing
each student according to his personal endowments,
but he also began the training of future teachers
by giving them a living example of what their work
should be.

The success of Ohm as a teacher was recognized on
all sides. His attitude towards his scholars was very different
from that which was assumed by many teachers.
Instead of being a mere conveyer of scientific information,
he was himself "a high priest of science," as one
of his pupils declared, supplying precious inspiration,
and not merely pointing out the limits of lessons and
finding out whether they were known, but making work
productively interesting, while neglecting none of the
details. His pupils became distinguished engineers,
and as this is the period in which the state railroads
were being built, there was plenty of opportunity for
them to apply the instruction they had received. Not
only were the reports of the Royal Commission of
Inspection repeated evidence of Ohm's success as a
teacher, but the technical schools which were under the
care of Ohm's disciples soon came to be recognized as
far above the average, and as representing not only the
successful teaching of technics on his part, but also the
influence that his example as a teacher had in forming
others to carry on the work.

How much Ohm was beloved by those who knew him
best can be properly appreciated from the following passage
from the panegyric delivered in Munich in 1855,
not long after his death, by Professor Lamont, who
had known him intimately: "Nature," he said, "conferred
upon Ohm goodness of heart and unselfishness to
an unusual degree. These precious qualities formed the
groundwork of all his intercourse with his fellows. Despite
the underlying strength of his character, which
kept him faithfully at work during all his career, whenever
there was question of merely personal advantage
to himself, he preferred to yield to pressure from without,
rather than rouse himself to resistance, and he thus
avoided all bitterness in life. The unfortunate events
which forced him, during the early part of his career,
from an advantageous position back into private life,
did not produce any misanthropic feelings in him, and
when later a brilliant recognition gave him that rank in
the world of science which by right belonged to him, his
simplicity of conduct was not in any way modified, nor
was the modesty of his disposition at all altered." In a
word, Ohm was one of those rare geniuses whose magnanimity
placed him above the vicissitudes of fortune.
His power to do original work was not disturbed by the
opposition which a really new discoverer invariably
meets, but his unfailing equanimity was just as little
exalted into conceit and pretentiousness by the praise
which so justly came to him once the real significance of
his scientific work dawned upon the world.

With the realization of all that Ohm's Work meant in
the department of electricity, it is easy to understand
how his name deserves a place in the science for all time.
In order permanently to honor his memory, the International
Congress of Electricians, which met at Paris in
1881, confirmed the action of the British Association of
1861, by giving the name ohm to the unit of electrical resistance.
This is an ideal monument to the great worker.
It is as simple and modest a reward as even he would
have wished, expressing as it does, the gratitude of
succeeding generations of scientists for all time.

FOOTNOTES:



[23] Ohm's brother, Martin Ohm, deserves a passing word, because his life is characteristically
different in certain ways and because, above all, it represents academic
success, while Ohm's was almost an academic failure. He finally received the professorship
in mathematics at Berlin, and came to be considered as one of the greatest
professors of the subject in Europe. Their careers form typical examples of the fact,
often notable in history, that talent finds a ready welcome in the academic world,
while genius is often neglected, and indeed may be, and often is, the target for bitter
opposition. The younger Ohm's writings are mainly with regard to mathematics, but
nearly always from some general rather than special standpoint, and very often with
regard to the educational side of the subject. His first book was on Analytic and
Higher Geometry in their Elements. He then wrote class text-books of mathematics
and mechanics. One of his works, The Spirit of Mathematical Analysis and its Relation
to a Logical System, because of its value as an educational document attracted
widespread attention. This book, translated by Ellis into English, was published in
London in 1845. One of Martin Ohm's earlier books should be of special interest to
educators because of its subject. Its rather lengthy title is, "An Attempt to Formulate
a Short, Fundamental, Clear Method to Enable Those without a Taste for
Mathematics to Learn the Mathematics Necessary for the Higher and Technical
Schools."

CHAPTER X.
Faraday.


The maxim current among European scientists, that
it is well to wait before accepting any scientific discovery
to see what will be said about it on the other side of the
Rhine, throws a rather curious sidelight on the supposed
absoluteness of scientific knowledge. Gallic enthusiasm
or German subtlety may evolve plausible theories that
look like scientific discoveries, but the destructive criticism
of the neighbor nation usually saves the scientific
world from deception. Not infrequently, the English-speaking
scientists held the balance between these rivals
in the intellectual world, and their adhesion to either
party or side of a question secured its dominance. When
all three, Germans and French and English, are agreed
as to the value of a scientific discovery, then it may be
looked upon as having some of the absoluteness, or at
least possesses for the moment the finality of scientific
truth. If this triple agreement be taken as the criterion
of the significance of a great scientist's work, then must
Michael Faraday be considered as without doubt one of
the greatest scientists of our time, and probably the
greatest experimental scientist that the world has
known.



Michael Faraday


Dubois Reymond, in Berlin, declared Faraday "the
greatest experimentalist of all times, and the greatest
physical discoverer that ever lived." Professor Martius
said before the Academy of Sciences at Munich,
"Deservedly has Faraday been called the greatest experimenter
of his epoch, and that the greatest epoch of
scientific experimentation down to our time." Dumas,
the French chemist, in the panegyric delivered before the
French Academy of Sciences, declared that Faraday was
"the greatest scientific scholar that the Academy ever
possessed." In order to give a picture of what he had
accomplished in electricity, added Dumas, one would
have to write a complete treatise on that subject.
"There is nothing in this department of science that
Faraday has not investigated completely or very materially
modified. Much of this chapter of our modern science
is his creation and belongs undeniably to him."
Beside these testimonies from French and German scientific
contemporaries must be placed Tyndall's appreciation,
which sets forth his brother scientist's merits.
"Take him all in all," he said, "it must be admitted, I
think, that Michael Faraday was the greatest experimental
scientist that the world has ever seen."

Nor did these magnificent appreciations of Faraday
cease when the enthusiasm for his memory, immediately
after his death, had faded somewhat into sober realization
of his merits. When Dumas summed up Faraday
in the first Faraday lecture of the English Chemical
Society, he said: "Faraday was a type of the most
fortunate and the most accomplished of the learned men
of our age. His hand, in the execution of his conceptions,
kept pace with his mind in designing them; he
never wanted boldness when he undertook an experiment,
never lacked resources to insure success, and was
full of discretion when interpreting results. His hardihood,
which never halted once he had undertaken a
task, and his wariness, which felt its way carefully in
adopting a received conclusion, will ever serve as models
for the experimentalist."

It is evident that the life of Faraday should be of
supreme interest for a generation that is mainly interested
in experimental science, and it so happens that
his career contains many other sources of interest;
for Faraday was a self-made man, who owed very little
to anyone but himself and his own genius. Besides, he
was a deep thinker with regard to all the problems of
human life as well as those of science, and while he was
a genial, kindly friend to those near him, the charming
associate whom scientific intimates always welcomed,
he had no illusions with regard to life being the
end of all things, but looked confidently to the hereafter,
and shaped his life here from that point of view.

Michael Faraday was born at Newington Butts, now
called Stoke Newington, an outskirt of London, in Surrey,
September 22d, 1791. His father was a journeyman
blacksmith whose health was not very good, and
as a consequence, the family suffered not a little from
poverty. Both his parents were noted for their good
habits, industrious lives and deep religious feelings.
In spite of their poverty, as is much oftener the case
than is sometimes thought, their children were brought
up very carefully and had a precious training in
high principles. Like most of his great colleagues in
scientific discovery, Faraday had to begin to earn his
livelihood early in life. Of educational opportunities he
had practically none. He learned to read and write,
and probably had a certain slight training in doing simple
sums in arithmetic, but that was the extent of his
formal teaching, and much of that he got at home. He
had to help in the support of his family, and so it seemed
fortunate that not far away from his home there was
a bookstore and bindery, the owner of which became
interested in the Faradays and took Michael as an errand
boy when he was scarcely thirteen years of age.

It was here that the future scientist began his education
for himself and, strange as it may seem, laid the
deep foundation of his knowledge of science. For the
first year he carried newspapers around to the customers,
and did his work so faithfully that at the end of this
time the book-binder offered to take him as an apprentice
to the trade, without the usual premium which used
to be rather strictly required for teaching boys their
trades at that time. Faraday accepted this offer, but
proved to be interested much more than in the outsides
of the books he bound. Whatever of leisure there
was he took advantage of to read a number of works on
experimental science that happened to be in the shop.
Luckily for him, some of these were classics. As an
introduction to chemistry, he had Mrs. Marcet's "Conversations
on Chemistry" and Robert Boyle's "Notes
about the Producibleness of chimicall Principles." He
was even more interested in electricity than in chemistry,
however, and Lyons' "Experiments on Electricity"
and the article on electricity in the Encyclopedia
Britannica, whetted his interest and made the boy wish
for more of such information. There probably could not
be a better proof of the fact that, a man who really has
intellectual interests will find the material with which
to satisfy them, in spite of untoward circumstances,
than this boyish experience of Faraday.

It is a curious anticipation of Faraday's after-career
that he at once began to demonstrate by personal experiment
some of the statements that he found in the
books. He procured a stock of chemicals as far as his
meagre salary would allow, and constructed a practical
electrical machine, though he had nothing better than a
large glass bottle to serve as a cylinder for it. When
not yet fourteen, he noticed an advertisement of a set
of lectures on natural philosophy. He was at once
taken with the idea of going to them, but the price of
admission, one shilling, seemed to place them entirely
beyond him. His elder brother, who followed his
father's trade of blacksmith, had more money than he,
and, when properly cajoled, was persuaded to provide
the necessary shillings, and so Faraday got to the lectures.
Elder brothers do not often have to lend shillings
to their juniors for admission to scientific lectures now
any more than in Faraday's time, so that the incident
seems worth noting.

In attendance at these lectures, Faraday not only
learned much that was new to him in science, but met
a number of earnest fellow-students and formed some
life-long friendships. He took copious notes, and afterwards
wrote them out in a fine, legible hand, making
excellent drawings in perspective of the apparatus employed
in the experiments. His notes were so extensive
that Faraday bound them himself, in four volumes, with
an index. These volumes are still preserved in the
library of the Royal Institution as one of the precious
treasures among its Faraday relics.[29] The whole story
of these early years of Faraday's life is a series of
illustrations of how a young man without the necessary
opportunities for his favorite studies can make them
for himself. Everything seemed to be against his
acquiring a thorough knowledge of science, yet he
succeeded in creating for himself the equivalent of a
good scientific course out of his meagre chances to hear
lectures and read books on his favorite subject in the
intervals of a busy life as book-seller and book-binder.

Things did not always continue to run along as pleasantly
in life for young Faraday as while he was working
for his book-binder friend as an apprentice. With the
conclusion of his apprenticeship he became a journeyman
book-binder, and his first employer proved to be a
hard task-master. It did not matter how much work
Faraday did or how well, it never quite satisfied this
French émigré, until it is no wonder that Faraday
looked for another occupation. For a time, he had the
congenial occupation of acting as amanuensis for Sir
Humphry Davy, who, while working on a new violent
explosive, probably chloride of hydrogen, met with an
accident which prevented him from using his eyes for
some time. This occupation, pleasant and even alluring
as it was, lasted only for a few days, however. It had
the fortunate result of suggesting to Faraday to apply
to Sir Humphry Davy in person for a position not
long after, and it eventually brought him the position of
assistant at the Royal Institution.

His anxiety to secure this post had been increased by
the growing realization that a business life was not to
his liking. It seemed to him a waste of time, or worse,
for a man to give himself up to the making of money.
Even thus young he had the ambition to add to the
knowledge possessed by mankind, and the insatiable
desire to increase the opportunities of others to learn
whatever they were interested in. Accordingly, he set
about finding the chance to devote himself entirely to
science.

In writing years after to Dr. Paris, he says: "My
desire to escape from trade, which I thought vicious and
selfish, and to enter into the service of science, which I
imagined made its pursuers amiable and liberal, induced
me at last to take the bold and simple step of writing to
Sir Humphry Davy, expressing my wishes, and a hope
that, if an opportunity came in his way, he should favor
my views; and at the same time I sent the notes I had
taken of his lectures." Davy called, not long after, on
one of his friends, who was at the time honorary inspector
of the models and apparatus at the Royal Institution,
and with the letter before him asked: "Here is
a letter from a young man named Faraday; he has been
attending my lectures and wants me to give him employment
at the Royal Institution. What can I do?"
"Do?" replied the inspector; "put him to wash bottles.
If he is good for anything, he will do it directly; if
he refuses, he is good for nothing." "No, no," replied
Davy, "we must try him with something better than
that."

Davy wrote a kind reply, and arranged for an interview
with young Faraday. In this, however, he
candidly advised him to stick to his business, telling
him very plainly that "science was a harsh mistress,
and, from a pecuniary point of view, but poorly rewarded
those who devoted themselves to her service." He apparently
put an end to all further consideration of the
subject by promising Faraday the book-binding work
of the Institution, and his own besides.

Faraday was not satisfied to go back to the book-shop,
even with all this kindly patronage, but there was nothing
else for it, and so for a time he continued at his
duties and spent his spare moments reading science and
his evenings at scientific lectures, or in remaking the
experiments he had seen and others suggested by them,
and above all in rewriting the notes that he had taken.
There is no livelier picture in all the history of science,
of how a man will, in spite of all obstacles, get the
things he cares for, if he really cares for them, than
that of Faraday thus teaching himself science in the
face of what seems almost insurmountable discouragement.
Fortunately, not long after he had been thus
forcibly called to the attention of Sir Humphry Davy,
the former assistant in the laboratory of the Royal
Institution not only neglected his duties, but became a
source of considerable annoyance. His misfortune
proved Faraday's opportunity. He was offered the post.
The salary was only twenty-five shillings a week, but
he accepted it very willingly. One might think that at
last his scientific career was opened for him, but his
new post was no sinecure. The labors required from
him, indeed, were so manifold that it is somewhat
surprising that he found any time for his own improvement.
His duties as set forth in writing were:



"To attend and assist the lecturers and professors
preparing for and during lectures. Where any instruments
or apparatus may be required, to attend to their
careful removal from the model room and laboratory to
the lecture room, and to clean and replace them after
being used, reporting to the managers such accidents as
shall require repair, a constant diary being kept by him
for that purpose. That in one day in each week he be
employed in keeping clean the models in the repository,
and that all the instruments in the glass cases be
cleaned and dusted at least once within a month."

The previous assistant had complained of the amount
of work that was required of him. It is easy to see
that his duties were rather exacting and time-taking.
Faraday did not confine himself to them, though he did
perform them with great assiduity. His interest in
experimental chemistry was soon noted, and he was allowed
to take his share in the experiments going on in
the laboratory. Some of his first work was the extraction
of sugar from beet-root; but he was soon to have
abundant experience of the deterring side of chemistry.
Not long after he began his work in the laboratory, he
had to manufacture some bisulphide of carbon, one of
the most nauseating of compounds. He found it disgusting
enough as an experience, but the study of it
brought its compensation.

It was much more than foul odors that Faraday had
to encounter, for Davy was still occupying himself with
the study of the explosives, in the investigation of which
he had been injured the previous year. Faraday suffered
from four or five explosions during the course of
the first month or two of his employment. Indeed, the
substance with which they were experimenting proved
so unreliable in this regard that, after a second rather
serious injury to Davy, further study of it was given up.

Once Faraday had secured his post at the Royal Institution,
his life-work was before him, and he became
deeply engaged in scientific speculations, investigations
and experiments of all kinds. The young man who
had found and made opportunities when they were so
distant and difficult, now made use of all that were
so ready at hand. He did not confine himself to his
laboratory work, however, but seems always to have
felt that the contact of minds engaged along the same
lines was the best possible way to be stimulated to
knowledge. He applied and was admitted as member
of the Philosophical Society of London, an association of
some two score of men occupied with many things during
the day, but interested in science, so far as they
could get the books and the opportunities for its study.
They met every Wednesday evening and discussed
various subjects in science or, as they called it then, in
philosophy, and they seem to have occupied themselves
with many questions in the social as well as the natural
sciences. These men, most of whom were older than
Faraday, soon came to look up to him because of the
depth and increasing breadth of his knowledge, and we
have some emphatic expressions of their admiration for
him.

Faraday's earliest successful scientific investigation
was accomplished in chemistry. This might have been
expected, from the fact that he began his work with
Sir Humphry Davy, whose principal scientific investigations
had been concerned with chemistry. His own
great scientific work was to be done in electricity. Even
in the brief time that he devoted to chemistry, however,
he succeeded in making some discoveries of deep significance.
For instance, in his special study of chlorine,
he demonstrated the existence of the two chlorides of
carbon which had not hitherto been obtained. Above
all, he impressed his personality upon methods in chemistry.
He was the first to realize how much technics
were to mean in the modern advancement of science,
and he made methodic chemistry, in distinction from
practical chemistry, the object of very special study.
His work on Chemical Manipulation did more to train
successful students of chemistry and to make good
investigators in this department of science than any
other single work in his generation. It has continued
to be of interest down even to our own time, and is well
worthy of consultation by all those who are interested
in chemistry as a science, and especially in original
research in that subject.

It was with regard to gases, however, that Faraday's
most striking chemical work was done. He succeeded in
liquefying several gases, and was the first to make clear
that all matter could probably exist in each of the three
different states       solid, liquid and gaseous       according as
the proper conditions for each particular state were present.
One might almost have expected that the serious
dangers incurred in his early days in the Royal Institution,
when his chief, Sir Humphry Davy, suffered so
severely and he himself was more than once involved,
might have deterred him from further investigation
along similar lines; but Faraday's ardor for scientific
investigation overcame any hesitancy there might have
been. The effect of gases upon human beings proved
as attractive to Faraday as it had been to Davy. His
experiments upon chlorine threatened to prove seriously
injurious to his throat, and he was warned of the danger
that he was running in the effort to determine whether
such gases were respirable and what their effects upon
human beings were. The warning was disregarded,
however, though he exercised somewhat more care in
subsequent observations. His experiments in the respiration
of gases finally led him to a discovery of cardinal
importance in the very practical field of anæsthesia.
Sir Humphry Davy, just at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, had made a series of interesting experiments
on nitrous oxide gas, the so-called "laughing
gas," and had pointed out very definitely its anæsthetic
properties. While suffering from toothache he had
inhaled the gas, and had experienced prompt alleviation
of the pain. He described in detail these curious
effects, and suggested that there might be a place for
nitrous oxide in surgery, at least for minor operations.
The words he employed with regard to this subject show
that the idea of anæsthesia, as we now understand it,
had come to him very definitely. Not quite a score of
years later, Faraday, recalling the experiments of Davy
with nitrous oxide, studied sulphuric ether, and showed
that the inhalation of the vapor of this substance produced
anæsthetic effects very similar to those of nitrous
oxide gas, but with the possibility of prolonging them
much more easily and apparently with less danger than
would be the case with the latter. In every history
of anæsthesia, these two sets of experiments at the
Royal Institution must be set down as foundation-stones,
and Faraday's name particularly must be hailed as one
of the initiators of a supremely beneficent advance in
modern surgery.

Faraday had given up business to devote himself to
science, and he was not to be seduced from the purpose
of making his life unselfish and doing things, not for
money, but for the good of science and his own satisfaction.
As a practical chemist, he soon had many
opportunities to increase his salary by making analyses
for industrial purposes. During one year, the amount
of work thus offered him was paid for so well that it
formed an addition of some £500 sterling to his salary.
It took away precious time, however, that he might
otherwise devote to original work. As soon as Faraday
realized this possibility of interference with his scientific
investigations, he cut it off, quite content to live on the
modest salary of his position at the Royal Institution.
His action in the matter would remind one very much
of Pasteur, in the latter half of the century, when asked
by the Empress Eugénie, to whom he had been just
exhibiting his discoveries in fermentation, whether he
would not apply these to actual manufacture and so
make a fortune for himself in brewing. Pasteur replied
that he thought it unworthy of a French scientist to
devote his time to money-making, with all the world of
science open before him.[30]

With a conscientious patriotism, however, that was
typical of the man and his ways, there was one exception
to this rule of not taking outside work that Faraday
made. In a letter to Lord Auckland, long afterward, he
says: "I have given up for the last ten years or more,
all professional occupation and voluntarily resigned a
large income, that I might pursue in some degree my
own objects of research. But in doing this I have always,
as a good subject, held myself ready to assist the
government if still in my power, but not for pay; for,
except in one instance (and then only for the sake of the
person joined with me), I refused to take it. I have had
the honor and pleasure of application, and that very
recently, from the Admiralty, the Ordnance, the Home
Office, the Woods and Forests and other departments,
all of which I have replied to and will reply to as long
as strength is left me."

As we have said, Faraday's principal work was accomplished
in the domain of electricity. His supreme
discovery, and, indeed, the most important practical
discovery in the whole realm of electricity, was that
of the induction effect of a current of electricity on a
neighboring circuit. This was accomplished by experimental
work of the highest order. Toward the end of
1824, when he was about thirty-three, he came to the
definite conclusion that an electric current might be obtained
by the motion of a magnet. His mind had been
prepared for such a conclusion by Oersted's significant
discovery in July, 1820, that an electric current acts
somewhat like a magnet when the wire through which
it flows is free to move. This discovery, definitely
connecting electricity and magnetism, had been elaborated
to an important degree by Ampère, and its sphere
of application broadened by Wollaston. The curious
though not unusual result in such cases, that it is not
those who are in immediate touch with a great discoverer
who develop or even apply his work, was illustrated by
the fact that Ampère, the Frenchman, took up Oersted's
discovery first, while Wollaston, working in England,
had been the next one to follow successfully in the path
thus opened up. It takes genius to go even a slight
step farther into the unknown; the trained talent of
disciples does not suffice. It was now Faraday, though
not under Wollaston's influence, who was to continue
successfully these labors.

In spite of his persuasion that a magnet would produce
by induction an electric current, and the further
step that a current in one wire could induce a current
in another, experiments during seven years had brought
him very little nearer the actual demonstration of this
important principle. Those who think that great discoveries
are made by accident and almost fall into the
laps of their makers, as the apple upon Newton, should
recall these seven years of unsuccessful labor on the
part of Faraday. Finally, in 1831, he obtained the first
definite evidence that an electric current can induce
another in a different circuit. The discovery meant so
much for him, that he hesitated to believe in his own
success. Nearly a month after this first demonstration
for himself, he wrote to his friend Phillips: "I am
busy just now again on electro-magnetism, and think I
have got hold of a good thing, but can't say. It may
be a weed instead of a fish that, after all my labor, I
may at last pull up."

He had long suspected, as we have said, that induction
should occur, and he had tried currents of different
strength, but without result. One day he noticed that,
though he could not produce a permanent induced current,
whenever the primary current started or stopped,
there was a movement of the galvanometer connected
with the secondary circuit, though the galvanometer
remained at zero so long as the primary current flowed
steadily. From this he proceeded to the demonstration
that a bar magnet suddenly thrust into a helix of copper
wire produced the same effect on the galvanometer, and
evidently induced a transient current. When the magnet
was withdrawn, the galvanometer needle swung
in the opposite direction, showing another current, so
that electrical currents were evidently induced by the
relative motions of a magnet and a conductor. He
continued his experiments in many different forms, and
in the short space of a little more than a week, once
the first definite hint was obtained, succeeded in so
completely finding out the phenomena of electro-magnetic
induction that scarcely more than practical applications
in this subject were left for his successors.

Faraday's explanation of the induction of currents in
the secondary circuit was probably quite as important a
contribution to science as the series of experiments by
which he demonstrated the occurrence of induced currents.
His mind was not of the order that would accept
action at a distance; that is, without some conducting
medium through which the action took place. The old
aphorism of the scholastics, "actio in distans repugnat"       action
at a distance, that is, without a medium intervening,
is absurd       would have appealed to him as a
basic truth. The explanation that he outlined for induced
currents was based on the lines of magnetic
force, which he had so often delineated by means of
iron filings. It was a favorite occupation of his, at moments
of comparative leisure, to make varied pictures
in iron filings of magnetic fields as they were exhibited
under the influence of different combinations of magnets.
He strewed iron filings over "gum paper," and
then when the filings had arranged themselves in certain
definite lines, he threw a jet of steam on the paper, which
melted the gum and fixed the filings in position. He explained
electrical action as the transmission of force
along such lines as these, and he thought the whole
electric field was filled with them.

Probably the best summary of Faraday's work on induction
and its significance has been given us by Clerk
Maxwell, in his article on Faraday, in the ninth edition
of the Encyclopedia Britannica. There is no doubt
but that Maxwell, above all men of the nineteenth century,
was in a position to judge of the meaning of
Faraday's work. He was not the sort of a man to say
things in a panegyric mood, and his article on Faraday
is indeed a model of well-considered judgment and
critical illumination. Summing up the significance not
only of Faraday's great discovery of induction, but also
his theory in explanation of that discovery, he does not
hesitate to say that his (Faraday's) opinion is the
nearest approach to truth that has been advanced in this
much-discussed subject.

"After nearly half a century of labor of this kind, we
may say that, though the practical applications of Faraday's
great discovery have increased and are increasing
in number and value every year, no exception to the
statement of these laws as given by Faraday has been
discovered; no new law has been added to them; and
Faraday's original statement remains to this day the
only one which asserts no more than can be verified by
experiment, and the only one by which the theory of
the phenomena can be expressed in a manner which is
actually and numerically accurate, and at the same time
within the range of elementary methods of exposition."

With what eminent care and absolute truth Faraday's
conclusions were reached may be judged from some
further expressions of Clerk Maxwell's in the article just
quoted, with regard to the attitude of certain mathematicians
toward Faraday's work. In this matter,
Clerk Maxwell, in talking on a theme that he had made
especially his own, and in which his opinion must carry
the greatest possible weight, said:

"Up to the present time, the mathematicians who
have rejected Faraday's method of stating his law as
unworthy of the precision of their science, have never
succeeded in devising any essentially different formula
which shall fully express the phenomena, without introducing
the hypotheses about the mutual action of things
which have no physical existence, such as elements of
currents, which flow out of nothing, then along the
wire, and finally sink into nothing again."

Faraday's results were described in papers afterwards
incorporated in his first series of "Experimental Researches,"
which were read before the Royal Society,
November 24th, 1841. These papers probably contain
the best possible proof of Faraday's genius as an experimentalist
and a leader in scientific observation. Within
a few months after his first successful experiment, he
had succeeded in bringing to perfection the whole doctrine
of induction by currents and magnets, had laid
down the fundamental ideas which were to constitute the
formal basis of electro-magnetism for all time. Perhaps
no better idea of the importance of the discovery thus
made by Faraday can be given than will be found in Clerk
Maxwell's compendious paragraph on this subject, in
his sketch of Faraday, in the Encyclopedia Britannica.
It may be said that no one in all the nineteenth century
was more capable of appreciating properly the value of
Faraday's work than this great electrical mathematician,
who laid the firm foundation of mathematical electricity
during the latter part of the nineteenth century.
Clerk Maxwell says:

"This was of course a great triumph, and nobody
appreciated this fact better than Faraday himself, who
had been working at its problems for many years. One
of the first problems that he had set himself in his note-book
as a young man, was 'to convert magnetism into
electricity,' and this he had now done. Within a month
of the time that his first successful experiment was
formed, he succeeded in obtaining induction currents by
means of the earth's magnetism. Within a year he took
the further immense step of obtaining a spark from the
induced current. This would ordinarily have seemed
quite impossible, since sparks occur only if the electromotive
force is very high, and it was very low in his
induced currents. He found, however, that if the
circuit of wire in which a current was flowing is broken
while the current is passing, a little bridge of metallic
vapor is formed, across which the spark leaps. The
difficulty with the experiment was to break the circuit
during the extremely short period while the current is
flowing. Faraday succeeded in doing this, and as a
result obtained the first germ of the electric light.
When he demonstrated this experiment by a very
ingenious apparatus at the meeting of the British
Association at Oxford, all were deeply interested, yet
probably no one, even the most sanguine of the scientists
present, thought for a moment that they saw the beginning
of a far-reaching revolution of all the lighting
of the world."

Perhaps the most interesting of Faraday's discoveries,
from the scientific standpoint, because they throw so
much light on the problems of all the related phenomena
of magnetism, heat, light, even electricity, were those
in which a ray of polarized light was used as a means
of investigating the condition of transparent bodies
when acted on by electric and magnetic forces. Faraday
himself, when he was just thirty years of age, made a
note in his commonplace laboratory book, in which all
his observations were carefully detailed, that serves to
show how much this subject had begun to interest him
thus early in his career. He mentions that he had
polarized a ray of lamp-light by reflection, and had
made various experiments to ascertain whether any
depolarizing action was exerted on it by water placed
between the poles of a voltaic battery in a glass cistern,
or by various fluids which were decomposed by the
voltaic action during the course of the experiment.
Besides water, the fluids used were weak solutions of
sulphate of soda and strong sulphuric acid. None of
them had any effect on the polarized light, either during
the passage of the voltaic current or when this was
shut off. No particular arrangement of particles in
reference to polarized light could be found from these
observations.

Such a note, with utter failure for conclusion, is
common enough in Faraday's note-book. He was never
discouraged, however, by failure at the beginning.
Once a subject has been taken up seriously, it is almost
inevitable that further observations with regard to it will
be found during the course of the year. Because he
had asked one question of nature and had not obtained
a satisfactory answer, was never a reason why he
should not ask further questions along the same line;
and, above all, why he should not ask the same question
in another way. After having tried a continuous
current, Faraday next experimented on the effect of
making and breaking the circuit. He did not expect
very much from this, but he hoped that under circumstances
when no decomposition would ensue as the
effect of the current, he might find some indication
of the polarization. It was nearly twenty-five years
before Faraday succeeded in solving the problem that he
had thus set himself as a young man, and nearly twenty
years more were to pass before he made the relation
between magnetism and light the subject of his very
last experimental work. Nothing discouraged him.
When he had resolved to investigate something, he
continued to make his experiments over and over again
in different ways, until finally he got an answer to his
question and a solution to the problem.

Indeed, his perseverance in anything that he undertook
was a striking characteristic of the man and one
of the most important elements in his success in life.
His tenacity of purpose showed itself equally in little
as in great things. Arranging some apparatus one
day with a philosophical instrument-maker, he let fall
on the floor a small piece of glass. He made several
ineffectual attempts to pick it up. "Never mind," said
his companion, "it is not worth the trouble." "Well,
but, Murray, I don't like to be beaten by something
that I have once tried to do."

Faraday was sure that there was some very definite
relation between electricity and light. His experiments,
however, did not enable him to demonstrate this until
nearly fifteen years after his successful experiment on
induction. In September, 1845, he placed a piece of
heavy glass made of silico-borate of lead in the field of
a magnet, and found that, when a beam of polarized
light was transmitted through the glass in the direction
of the lines of force, there was a rotation of the plane
of polarization. Later experiments showed him that all
transparent solids and liquids were capable of producing
this rotation in greater or less degree. When no magnet
was used and the transparent substance was placed
within a coil of wire through which an electric current
was flowing, similar effects were produced. This was
the demonstration of a definite relation between light
and electricity. Later, Faraday found that magnets
had a directive action upon the glass. He then made
experiments upon gases, and found that they too exhibited
magnetic phenomena, and that, indeed, the
diurnal variations of the compass-needle were due to
the sun's heat diminishing the magnetic permeability
of the oxygen of the air. Further experiments with
gases showed him that nitrogen was absolutely neutral
in its reaction.

It might have been expected, from Faraday's early
interest in chemistry, that when he turned to electricity
and made discoveries in that field of research, he would
naturally take up the problem of tracing the laws and
demonstrating the relationships of the points of contact
of the two great sciences. After his completion, then,
of the subject of induction, Faraday devoted himself to
the experimental proof of the identity of frictional and
voltaic electricity, and to showing that chemistry and
physics have a common ground. His inductive electrical
machine could deflect a magnet and decompose iodide
of potash. With his tendency to measure things, he
determined that the amount of electricity required
to decompose a grain of water was equal to 800,000
charges of his large battery of Leyden jars. On the
other hand, the current from a frictional machine deflected
the needle of his galvanometer in the same way
as the induced current of electricity, so that all the
elements of the proof of the identity of the two forms
of phenomena were now in his hands.

That he should have proceeded to the demonstration
of the laws of electrolysis, was the next most natural
result. He showed that the amount of any compound
decomposed by the electric current is exactly proportional
to the whole quantity of electricity which has passed
through the electrolyte. Different substances are variously
refractory to dissolution under the influence of
the electric current, but each one always acts in the
same way and requires the same amount of current.
Substances that are closely related to one another chemically,
are also related to one another in the amount of
electricity required to bring about decomposition of
their various compounds. He showed, of course, that
there are differences of electrical relationship that make
the results produced in the decomposition of various
compounds very different. Polarization, for instance,
sets in to a much greater degree in the decomposition
of some substances than of others. One consequence is
that the resistance to the passage of the electric current
differs markedly, and the opposing electromotive force
will stop the current or hamper its effects in many
cases, so that, until after actual experiment, the quantitative
effect of the passage of the electric current
through a solution cannot be determined.

Faraday's opinions as to the significance of electricity
in the animal economy are very interesting because of
his profound knowledge of electrical phenomena and
their place in nature. It is all the more interesting because
it is so simple, and most scientists would be apt
to say that its very simplicity is a very taking argument
for its truth. "As living creatures produce heat, and a
heat certainly identical with that of our hearths, why
should they not produce electricity also, and an electricity
in like manner identical with that of our machines?
Like heat, like chemical action, electricity is an implement
of life, and nothing more."

While Faraday often occupied himself with subjects
connected with matter and force that are likely to
remain mysteries for long after his time, and often had
thoughts to express with regard to the nature of atoms
and of imponderable agents, whatever he had to say
about these subjects was not vague and speculative,
but, on the contrary, was concrete and usually of such a
practical character as to add something new to our
knowledge of them. Few men have ever succeeded in
getting closer to the mysteries that underlie natural
phenomena than Faraday; yet no one was ever less
carried away into vague theoretic speculations with
regard to them, nor tempted to think that because he
knew much more than most other men with regard
to complex natural problems, that therefore he knew
enough to be able to solve the mysteries that existed all
around him. He had none at all of what would ordinarily
be called pride of intellect, but, on the contrary,
had the humility of the true scientist. Knowing
so much only made him realize more poignantly how
much he was ignorant of. With regard to his speculations
on matter and force and the imponderables, Helmholtz,
the great German physicist, once summed up
Faraday's contributions very succinctly in a way to
show the practical nature of Faraday's intellect. He
said:

"It is these things that Faraday in his mature works
ever seeks to purify more and more from everything
that is theoretical and is not the direct and simple
expression of the fact. For instance, he contended
against the action of forces at a distance, and the
adoption of two electrical and two magnetic fluids, as
well as all hypotheses contrary to the law of the conservation
of force, which he early foresaw, though he
misunderstood it in its scientific expression. And it is
just in this direction that he exercised the most unmistakable
influence, first of all, on the English physicist,
and then on the physicists of all the world."

Inventors and promoters of useful inventions, frequently
benefited by the advice of Faraday or by his
general help. A remarkable instance of this was told
by Mr. Cyrus W. Field. At the commencement of his
great enterprise, when he wished to unite the Old and
the New World by the telegraphic cable, he sought the
advice of the great electrician, and Faraday told him
that he doubted the possibility of getting a message
across the Atlantic. Mr. Field saw that this fatal objection
must be settled at once, and begged Faraday
to make the necessary experiments, offering to pay him
properly for his services. The philosopher, however,
declined all remuneration, but worked away at the
question, and presently reported to Mr. Field: "It can
be done; but you will not get an instantaneous message."
"How long will it take?" was the inquiry.
"Oh! perhaps a second." "Well, that's quick enough
for me," was the conclusion of the American; and the
enterprise was proceeded with.

Faraday was far from being a mere laboratory student;
he was much more even than a great teacher of
physics. He was a magnificent popular lecturer, and
did an incalculable amount to bring physics to the attention
and the serious interest of his generation. A contemporary
has described one of his lectures at the Royal
Institution in such a way as to give us some idea, even
at this distant date, of Faraday's power over his audience,
of his own wonderful interest in the subject and
his marvelous ability to communicate that interest to
others. It was of the very nature of the man that he
should not be cold and formal, for he was not a man of
the head alone, but, above all, a man whose heart and
affections were greatly developed, and he had powers
of enthusiasm that placed him high among the artistic
spirits of mankind. Our American poet, Stedman, once
declared that the intellectual quality of the poet, the
creator in the realm of thought, and of the scientist, the
original worker in the domain of science, differed but
little from one another, and must be considered as collateral
expressions of the same form of intellectual
genius. With this in mind, his contemporary's enthusiastic
description of his lectures will not seem overdrawn.

"It was an irresistible eloquence, which compelled
attention and insisted upon sympathy. It waked the
young from their visions, and the old from their dreams.
There was a gleaming in his eyes which no painter
could copy, and which no poet could describe. Their
radiance seemed to send a strange light into the very
heart of his congregation; and when he spoke, it was
felt that the stir of his voice and the fervor of his words
could belong only to the owner of those kindling eyes.
His thought was rapid, and made itself a way in new
phrases, if it found none ready made, as the mountaineer
cuts steps in the most hazardous ascent with his
own axe. His enthusiasm sometimes carried him to the
point of ecstasy."

Faraday's habit of testing opinions by experiment,
and the frequent disillusions which he encountered with
regard to things of which he thought he knew something
definite, served to make him extremely careful as
regards expressions of opinion. Some of his thoughts
on this subject are worth while recalling because they
remain perennially true, and anyone in any generation
will find that, as his experience grows, he gets more
and more into this Faraday mood of doubting his own
opinion and listening with more readiness to that of
others. As a rule, this is said not to be true of those
who are in advancing years, but the greater minds
among the older men do not get set in their ways.
Flourens might have said that because of constant
exercise the connective tissue in the brains of such men
does not form to the same extent as in others, and does
not make them case-hardened. As a consequence, they
retain far on in years their sympathy for others' opinions
and their openness of mind. Comparatively, they
are so few, however, that this expression of Faraday's
becomes a striking commentary on his large-mindedness.

"For proper self-education, it is necessary that a man
examine himself, and that not carelessly either.... A
first result of this habit of mind will be an internal
conviction of ignorance in many things respecting which
his neighbors are taught, and that his opinions and
conclusions on such matters ought to be advanced with
reservation. A mind so disciplined will be open to
correction upon good grounds in all things, even in those
it is best acquainted with, and should familiarize itself
with the idea of such being the case."

Perhaps it is even more interesting, because more
humanly sympathetic, to find that Faraday distrusted
his opinions of people even more than his opinions of
things, and that he himself tried to be very slow to
take offence at what was said to him, and counselled
greatest discretion to others in judging of the significance
of supposed slights.

"Let me, as an old man who ought by this time to
have profited by experience, say that when I was
younger, I found I often misinterpreted the intentions
of people, and found that they did not mean what at
the time I supposed they meant; and further, that, as a
general rule, it was better to be a little dull of apprehension
when phrases seemed to imply pique and quick
in perception, when, on the contrary, they seemed to
imply kindly feeling. The real truth never fails ultimately
to appear, and opposing parties, if wrong, are
sooner convinced when replied to forbearingly than
when overwhelmed."

Few lives have been happier than that of Faraday.
He gave up the ordinary ambition of men to make what
is called a successful career of money-making, and
constantly guarded himself from slipping back, as so
many do, to the ruin of their original purpose. He
lived a long life in peace, occupied with work that he
liked above all things, and surely serves as the best
illustration of the maxim: "Blessed is the man who
has found his work." Work is said to be one of the
primal curses laid upon man; but if, when the Creator
would ban it turns to blessing in the way that work has
done, then may one well ask what will His blessings
prove. Faraday even had what is rarer in life than
happiness, the consciousness of his happiness. Usually
it is so elusive that it escapes reflection. At the close
of his career, when he wrote, in 1861, to the managers
of the Royal Institution resigning most of his duties,
he expressed this feeling very beautifully, and at the
same time so simply and clearly as to make his letter of
resignation a precious bit of literature.

"I entered the Royal Institution in March, 1813,
nearly forty-nine years ago, and, with the exception of
a comparatively short period, during which I was abroad
on the continent with Sir H. Davy, I have been with
you ever since. During that time I have been most
happy in your kindness, and in the fostering care which
the Royal Institution has bestowed upon me. Thank
God, first, for all His gifts! I have next to thank you
and your predecessors for the unswerving encouragement
and support which you have given me during that
period. My life has been a happy one, and all I desired.
During its progress, I have tried to make a fitting return
for it to the Royal Institution, and through it to science.
But the progress of years (now amounting in number
to three-score and ten) having brought forth, first, the
period of development, and then that of maturity, has
ultimately produced for me that of gentle decay. This
has taken place in such a manner as to make the evening
of life a blessing; for, while increasing physical
weakness occurs, a full share of health, free from pain,
is granted with it; and while memory and certain other
faculties of the mind diminish, my good spirits and
cheerfulness do not diminish with them."

For nearly five years after he had given up to a great
degree his work at the Royal Institution, he faced
death, not with the equanimity of the stoic, but with
the peaceful happiness of the believer in Providence
and a hereafter. Even the loss of his memory, dear as
it must have been to a man who had spent all his life in
storing it with the great facts of science, does not seem
seriously to have disturbed him. He realized the necessity
for patience, and took the lesson of its necessity to
heart, so that there was no difficulty in it. Once when
calling on his friend, the distinguished scientist, Barlow,
who had for a lifetime almost worked beside him at the
Royal Institution, but who was now suffering from
paralysis, he said: "Barlow, you and I are waiting;
that is what we have to do now; and we must try to do
it patiently." When the full realization that his powers
were leaving him first came to him, he wrote to his
niece what he thought ought to be the feelings of the
believer in Providence toward death, and his letter
shows how thoroughly he had imbibed the great lessons
of Christianity, and how much of consolation his faith
was to him in this darkest hour before the dawn of that
other life, in which he had as implicit confidence as in
any of the great scientific principles that he had demonstrated
by experiment. He wrote:

"I cannot think that death has, to the Christian, anything
in it that should make it a rare, or other than a
constant thought. Out of the thought of death comes
the view of the life beyond the grave, as out of the
view of sin (that true and real view which the Holy
Spirit alone can give to man) comes the glorious Hope....
My worldly faculties are slipping away day by
day. Happy is it for all of us, that the true good lies
not in them. As they ebb, may they leave us as little
children, trusting in the Father of Mercies and accepting
His unspeakable gift." And when the dark shadow
was creeping over him, he wrote to the Comte de Paris:
"I bow before Him who is the Lord of all, and hope to
be kept waiting patiently for His time and mode of releasing
me, according to His divine word and the great
and precious promises whereby His people are made
partakers of the divine nature."

Probably the feature of the careers of Darwin and
Spencer which are saddest for their adherents, and
which made those who refused to be recognized as
among their followers appreciate their one-sidedness, is
the confession by both of them, that they had lost their
interest in poetry and even in literature of all kinds,
and toward the end of their lives particularly lost entirely
their appreciation of things artistic. As might
be expected from what we know of Faraday, this was
not at all the case with him; but, on the contrary, down
to the end of his life, he retained all his youthful admiration
for the poets. His niece tells the story of
hearing him often read poetry, and of how much he
used to be affected by his favorite poems. In one of
her letters she says:

"But of all things, I used to like to hear him read
'Childe Harold'; and never shall I forget the way in
which he read the description of the storm on Lake
Leman. He took great pleasure in Bryon, and Coleridge's
'Hymn to Mont Blanc' delighted him. When
anything touched his feelings as he read       and it happened
not infrequently       he would show it not only in
his voice, but by tears in his eyes also."

As a young man, he was so completely taken up with
the scientific studies that he could not think that he would
ever find time for the ordinary interests of life.
Especially was this true with regard to the question of
marriage. He felt that he would never marry, and he
seems rather to have pitied those, the weakness of
whose nature pushed them on to assume many duties in
life and look for merely selfish happiness. It was as a
very young man that he wrote:


"What is't that comes in false, deceitful guise,
Making dull fools of those that 'fore were wise?
'Tis Love."


When the time came, however, he altered this opinion.
Among the elders of the Church which he attended
in London was a Mr. Barnard, a silversmith. Faraday
occasionally spent an evening at his house, and incidentally
met his daughter Sarah. He had not met her
many times before his ideas as to what love might mean
in life were completely changed, and not long after
making her acquaintance he wrote her a letter, in
which he recants and asks her to be more than a friend.
His letter is rather interesting as love letters go.

"You know me as well or better than I do myself.
You know my former prejudices and my present
thoughts; you know my weaknesses, my vanity, my
whole mind; you have converted me from one erroneous
way; let me hope that you will attempt to correct what
others are wrong.... Again and again I attempt to
say what I feel, but I cannot. Let me, however, claim
not to be the selfish being that wishes to bend his affections
for his own sake only. In whatever way I can
best minister to your happiness, either by assiduity or
by absence, it shall be done. Do not injure me by
withdrawing your friendship, or punish me for aiming
to be more than a friend by making me less; and if you
cannot grant me more, leave me what I possess but
hear me."

In spite of the sincere feeling of this letter, the lady
hesitated. For a time she left London, apparently in
order to give herself a breathing spell from the ardor
of his suit. In spite of his deep interest in science,
Faraday followed her to the seacoast, and after they
had wandered together for several days at Margate and
Dover, where Shakespeare's Cliff Was an especial haunt
of theirs, the lady relented. Faraday returned to London
bubbling over with happiness. He was not quite
thirty when they were married, and at the time his
salary did not amount to more than a thousand dollars a
year. It was distinctly not a marriage of reason.

Most of the happiness of his life came to him from
his marriage. Many years afterward, he called it "An
event which, more than any other, contributed to my
happiness and healthful state of mind." With years,
this feeling only deepened and strengthened. In the
midst of his scientific triumphs, his first thought was
always of her. When his attendance at scientific congresses
took him away from her, his letters were frequent,
and always expressive of his longing to be with
her. One of his biographers has said "that doubtless
at any time between their marriage and his final illness,
he might have written to her as he did from Birmingham,
at the time of the meeting of the British
Association there."

"After all, there is no pleasure like the tranquil pleasure
of home; and here, the moment I leave the table, I
wish I were with you in quiet. Oh! what happiness
is ours! My runs into the world in this way only serve
to make me esteem that happiness the more."

Faraday had probably lost more illusions than most
men, and came to the true appreciation of things as
they are. In spite of his life-long study, he had no
illusions with regard to the education of the intellect
merely, or the possession of superior intellectual
faculties as moral factors. His keen observation of
men had made any such mistake as that impossible.
On the other hand, he had often noted that the ignorant,
or at least those lacking education, were very admirable
in conduct and in principle, and so we have his
suggestive testimony:

"I should be glad to think that high mental powers
insured something like a high moral sense, but have
often been grieved to see the contrary; as also, on the
other hand, my spirit has been cheered by observing in
some lowly and uninstructed creature such a healthful
and honorable and dignified mind as made one in love
with human nature. When that which is good mentally
and morally meet in one being, that that being is more
fitted to work out and manifest the glory of God in the
creation, I fully admit."

Faraday's very definite expression of what he considers
must be the position of the man of science with
regard to a hereafter and the existence of God, is worth
while recalling here, because it was such a modest yet
forceful presentation of the attitude of mind that every
thinking modern scientist must occupy in this matter,
the attitude which all of Faraday's great fellow-workers
in the domain of electricity also occupy. It is indeed
the position that has been assumed by all the great
scientists who bowed humbly to faith, though so many
lesser lights have found this apparently impossible. At
a lecture given in 1854 at the Royal Institution, Faraday
said: "High as man is placed above the creatures
around him, there is a higher and far more exalted
position within his view; and the ways are infinite in
which he occupies his thoughts about the fears, or
hopes, or expectations of a future life. I believe that
the truth of that future cannot be brought to his knowledge
by any exertion of his mental powers, however
exalted they may be; that it is made known to him by
other teaching than his own, and is received through
simple belief of the testimony given.... Yet even in
earthly matters, I believe that 'the invisible things of
Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that are made, even
His eternal power and godhead'; and I have never seen
anything incompatible between those things of man
which can be known by the spirit of man which is within
him, and those higher things concerning his future
which he cannot know by that spirit."

Elsewhere he had said: "When I consider the multitude
of associate forces which are diffused through
nature; when I think of that calm and tranquil balancing
of their energies which enables elements, most
powerful in themselves, most destructive to the world's
creatures and economy, to dwell associated together and
be made subservient to the wants of creation, I rise
from the contemplation more than ever impressed with
the wisdom, the beneficence, and grandeur beyond our
language to express, of the Great Disposer of all!"

Dr. Gladstone, in his Life of Faraday, which we have
so often put into requisition, has given in one striking
paragraph a description of the passing of Faraday, that
in its simplicity is worthy of the great man whom it so
well represents. It is so different from what is ordinarily
supposed to be the attitude of the scientist towards
death, that when by contrast we recall that Faraday is
acknowledged to be the greatest experimental scientist
of the nineteenth century, the man of his generation
most honored by scientific societies at home and abroad       his
honorary memberships numbered nearly one hundred       it
must be considered as a very curious contradiction
of what is the usual impression in this matter:
"When his faculties were fading fast, he would sit long
at the western window, watching the glories of the sunset;
and one day, when his wife drew his attention to a
beautiful rainbow that then spanned the sky, he looked
beyond the falling shower and the many-colored arch
and observed, 'He hath set His testimony in the heavens.'
On August 25th, 1867, quietly, almost imperceptibly,
came the release. There was a philosopher less on
earth, and a saint more in heaven."

When we come to the end of the life of this greatest
of experimentalists, the most striking remembrance is
that of the supreme original genius of this great discoverer
in electricity, whose work was such a stimulus
to others, whose conclusions were to prove the basis for
so much of the work of his contemporaries and his successors
in electrical investigation, and whose place in
the world of science is assured beside such men as
Newton and Kepler and Harvey and the other great
pioneers in science. There is no doubt at all, however,
that our heartiest feelings are aroused by the picture of
the wonderfully rounded existence of the great scientist,
his pervasive humanity, his largeness of soul and sympathy,
his understanding of men in their ways through
his own complete knowledge of himself, that is so strikingly
displayed. We feel sure that Faraday himself
would have cared less for his fame as a great scientist
than for the summary of his life which has been given
us by his friend, Bence Jones, who said: "His was a
life-long strife, to seek and say that which he thought
was true and to do that which he thought was kind."

CHAPTER XI.
Clerk Maxwell.


Natural science in every department developed very
wonderfully from its experimental side during the first
half of the nineteenth century. Facts and observations
accumulated to such an amount that, shortly after the
middle of the century, there was felt the need of a
great mathematical genius to bring the results of experiment
into their proper places in the great body of
applied and theoretic science. Nearly always such a
demand meets with adequate response in its own due
time. Clerk Maxwell came at this most opportune moment
for science. No mathematical problem was too
abstruse or difficult for him, and whatever he took up
seriously he always illuminated, and usually solved its
problems as completely as can be hoped for in the
present state of scientific knowledge. It was particularly
in electricity that his mathematical faculty proved
of the greatest value, and that he found the abundant
opportunities of which he knew so well how to take
advantage.



James Clerk Maxwell


Clerk Maxwell's theory of electricity, as developed in
his classic treatise on "Electricity and Magnetism," is
well called by Prof. Peter Guthrie Tait, "One of the most
splendid monuments ever raised by the genius of a
single individual." This book became the guide and
companion of more physical scientists during the nineteenth
century than perhaps any other written in that
period. It was not alone in England or in English-speaking
countries that it was accepted as an authority
and constantly referred to, but everywhere throughout
the world of science. Not to know it, was to argue
that a man knew nothing of the profounder truths of
electrical science and was only a seeker after superficial
information. Clerk Maxwell was known and esteemed
by all the great physical scientists of the world. His
name is less widely known than that of most of the
great discoverers in electricity, because mathematical
achievement always has less popular attraction; but
he deserves to be known by all who are interested in
science, not only because of his magnificent contributions
to mathematical electricity, but quite as much for
qualities of heart and mind that stamp him as one
of the very great men of the century so rapidly receding
from us.

Clerk Maxwell, as he is usually called, because he
was the representative of a younger branch of the well-known
Scottish family of Clerk of Penicuik, was born
in Edinburgh, June 13th, 1831. As with nearly every
other person who reaches distinction in after-life, there
are stories told of his precociousness which probably
have more meaning in this case than in most others,
since they exhibit real traits that were characteristic of
the man. As a child, it is said that he was never satisfied
until he had found out for himself everything that
he could about anything that attracted his attention.
He wanted to know where the streams of water came
from, where and whence all the pipes ran, and the
course of bell-wires and the like. His frequently repeated
question was, "What's the go o' that." If an
attempt were made to put him off with some indefinite
answer, then he would insist, "But what's the particular
go of it." This was probably the most prominent
trait in his after-life. General explanations of phenomena
that satisfied other men never satisfied him. He
was a nature student from the beginning, and even as a
boy he devised all sorts of ingenious mechanical contrivances.
Pet animals were his special delight, but for
experimental purposes always, and his selection of pets
would probably have startled some people.

He received his early education at the Edinburgh
Academy, and his university education at the University
of Edinburgh, where he graduated in 1850. His liking
for mathematics, which had already been very strongly
exhibited, led him, at the age of nineteen, to go to
Cambridge. Here, for a term or two, he was a student
at Peterhouse, but afterwards found a more sympathetic
place for his mathematical tastes at Trinity. He
took his degree at Cambridge in 1854, though only with
the rank of second wrangler, Routh being senior. In
the more serious and more exacting examination for the
Smith's Prize, he was declared equal with the senior
wrangler. His mathematical talents had developed very
early, and it is not surprising that the rest of his life
should have been devoted mainly to the teaching of mathematics
and in investigations connected with applied
mathematics. It was not success at the university that
determined his career, for he had shown his marvelous
mathematical ability much earlier than that, and had
given some astonishing examples of his power to treat
complex scientific problems in mathematical journals.

Indeed, his original contributions to the higher mathematics
began before he was fifteen years of age.
He was a striking example of the fact that a great
genius usually finds his work very early in life, and
usually accomplishes something significant in it, at once
the harbinger and the token of the future, before
he is twenty-five. While Clerk Maxwell was at the
Edinburgh Academy, Professor J. D. B. Forbes, in 1836,
communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a short
paper by his youthful student on "A Mechanical Method
of Tracing Oval Curves" (Cartesian Ovals).

In spite of the prejudice that exists with regard to
precocious genius and the distinct feeling that it is not
likely to prove an enduring quality, Clerk Maxwell continued
to do excellent original work all through his teens.
When he was but eighteen, he contributed two important
papers to the transactions of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh. One of these was on "The Theory of Rolling
Curves," and the other on "The Equilibrium of
Elastic Solids." These are now remembered, not only
because of Clerk Maxwell's subsequent distinguished
career, but because of their distinct value as contributions
to science. Both of them demonstrate not only his
ability to work out subtle mathematical problems at this
very early age, but show the possession by him of a
power of investigation for original work that stamps
them as well worthy of consideration in themselves,
quite apart from the repute of their author or the successful
accomplishments of his subsequent life.

With regard to one of those Edinburgh papers of
Clerk Maxwell's eighteenth year, Prof. Guthrie Tait
said "that in it he laid the foundation of one of the
singular discoveries of his later life, the temporary
double refraction produced in viscous liquid by sheering
stress." After his magnificent mathematical training
at Cambridge, it is not surprising that this academic
career of great original work should be continued by
contributions to science of ever-increasing importance.
Immediately after his graduation, he read to the Cambridge
Philosophical Society one of the few purely mathematical
papers that he ever published. This had for its
title, "On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending."
Expert mathematicians who read the paper, realized
at once that there was a new genius in the field of
mathematics. During the same year, the young Scotch
mathematician took the first step in that series of
electrical investigations which was to occupy so much of
his attention in after-life, and which was to prove the
source of his greatest inspirations. This consisted of
the publication of an elaborate paper on Faraday's "lines
of force."

While we think of Maxwell as a mathematical physicist,
it must not be forgotten that he was also one of the
leading experimental scientists of that great epoch, the
nineteenth century. Only a man who was himself a
great experimenter could have properly appreciated and
developed, from the mathematical standpoint, the works
of such men as Cavendish and Faraday. From his
early years, Maxwell displayed a distinct fondness for
experimentation, and this even extended to experiments
upon himself. In many ways this trait of his would remind
us of Johann Müller, the great father of modern
German medicine.[31] Like Müller, there was danger also
of Maxwell's experiments on himself getting him into
trouble. For instance, at one time his love of experiment
led him to try sleeping in the evening and getting
up to work at midnight, so as to have the long, silent
hours of the night to himself. In the sketch of his
life by Dr. Garnett,[32] a letter from one of his friends
is quoted with regard to this nocturnal habit, which is
amusing as well as interesting. The friend wrote:

"From 2 to 2:30 a. m. he took exercise by running
along the upper corridor, down the stairs, along the
lower corridor, then up the stairs, and so on until the inhabitants
of the rooms along his track got up and laid
perdus behind their sporting doors, to have shots at him
with boots, hair-brushes, etc., as he passed." His love
of fun, his sharp wit, his extensive knowledge, and,
above all, his complete unselfishness, rendered him a
universal favorite, in spite of the temporary inconveniences
which his experiments may have occasionally
caused to his fellow-students.

In 1857, Clerk Maxwell received the Adams Prize for
his essay on "The Stability of the Motion of Saturn's
Rings." He shows very clearly that these annular appendages
consist of a large number of small masses.
This work would seem to be very distant from anything
that Maxwell had attempted before, and would
indeed seem to the superficial observer, at least, to
be quite out of his sphere. It was the mathematics
of it that attracted him, and the fact that the problem
was difficult, indeed, one of the most difficult at that
time before astronomers, only added zest to his resolve
to fathom it. All his life, mathematics continued to be
his favorite form of work, and his power to express the
most complex physical phenomena in mathematical
formulæ gave him a reputation throughout Europe unsurpassed
by anyone of his generation. The more a
problem seemed incapable of direct statement in mathematical
terms, provided it represented a great occurrence
in nature, the more Maxwell was attracted to it;
and the training of these early years in thus setting
mathematics to the solution of physical relations, was
to serve him in good stead when he came to try his
hand at demonstrating the meaning of electricity in
mathematical terms.

Just before this, in 1856, Maxwell, though only twenty-five
years of age, was offered the chair of natural history,
which included most of the physical sciences, at
Marischal College, Aberdeen. With the attention that
his mathematical papers attracted, it is not surprising
that after four years of teaching experience he was
invited to King's College, London. He held his new
position for eight years, and then his health required
him to retire to his estate in Kirkcudbrightshire. After
three years of retirement, his English Alma Mater demanded
his services, and the temptation to get back
to an academic career was so great that he could not
resist it. He became, in 1871, Professor of experimental
physics at Cambridge. To him, more than to anyone
else, is due the magnificent development of the physical
sciences which took place at Cambridge during the
last quarter of the nineteenth century. Unfortunately,
he was not destined to live to enjoy the fruits of his
labor in organizing the scientific side of the university,
but it was under his direction that the plans of the
Cavendish Laboratory were prepared, and he superintended
every step of the progress of the building.
It was under his careful management, too, that the
purchase of the very valuable collection of apparatus,
with which it was equipped by the Duke of Devonshire,
was made, and Maxwell's work here counts for much
in the history of English science.

He died in 1879, when only forty-eight years of age,
but he had deeply impressed himself upon the science
of the nineteenth century. For quite one-half of his
scant half-century span of life he had occupied a prominent
place in England, and after the age of thirty-five
had come to be generally recognized as one of the leading
physical scientists of the world. His career is, as
we have said, a striking illustration of how early in life
a man's real work is likely to come to him, and how
little success in original investigation is dependent on
that development of mind which is supposed to be due
only to long years of application to a particular branch
of study. Manifestly it is the original genius that
counts for most, and not any training that it receives,
except such as comes from its own maturing powers.
Environment, if unfavorable, does not hamper it much,
nor keep it from reaching the proper terminus of its
destiny; and poor health only serves to prevent the
exercise of its full powers, but does not eclipse the
manifestation of its capacity.

Clerk Maxwell's important contribution to science
was the demonstration that electro-magnetic effects
travel through space in the form of transverse waves
similar to those of light and having the same velocity.
We have become so familiar with the ideas contained in
this explanation, that they seem almost obvious now.
They came, however, as a great surprise to Clerk Maxwell's
generation, and at first seemed to be merely a
theoretic expression of a mathematical formula. Not
long afterwards, however, Maxwell's explanation was
corroborated by Hertz, who showed that these waves
were propagated just as waves of light are, and that
they exhibit the phenomena of reflection, refraction and
polarization. Hertz went on from his demonstration of
the actuality of Maxwell's mathematical theory to the
demonstration of further electrical waves. These Hertzian
waves, as they were called, were a startling discovery,
but remained only a scientific curiosity until they
were taken advantage of for wireless telegraphy, when
a new era of applied electrical science began.

How his success in this was accomplished will be
best understood from Prof. Guthrie Tait's account of
Maxwell's devotion to electricity as a life-work. He
says:



"But the great work of his life was devoted to
electricity. He began by reading with the most profound
admiration and attention the whole of Faraday's
extraordinary self-revelations, and proceeded to translate
the ideas of that master into the succinct and expressive
notation of the mathematicians. A considerable part
of this translation was accomplished during his career
as an undergraduate in Cambridge. The writer had
the opportunity of perusing the MS. on Faraday's lines
of force, in a form little different from the final one, a
year before Maxwell took his degree. His great object,
as it was also the great object of Faraday, was to over-turn
the idea of action at a distance. The splendid researches
of Poisson and Gauss had shown how to
reduce all the phenomena of statical electricity to mere
attractions and repulsions exerted at a distance by particles
of an imponderable on one another. Sir W.
Thomson had, in 1846, shown that a totally different
assumption, based upon other analogies, led (by its
own special mathematical methods) to precisely the
same results. He treated the resultant electric force at
any point as an analogous flux of heat from the sources
distributed, in the same manner as the supposed electric
particles. This paper of Thomson's, whose ideas Maxwell
afterwards developed in an extraordinary manner,
seems to have given the first hint that there are at
least two perfectly distinct methods of arriving at the
known formulæ of statical electricity. The step to
magnetic phenomena was comparatively simple; but it
was otherwise as regards electromagnetic phenomena,
where current electricity is essentially involved. An
exceedingly ingenious, but highly artificial, theory had
been devised by Weber, which was found capable of
explaining all the phenomena investigated by Ampère
as well as the induction currents of Faraday. But this
was based upon the assumption of a distance-action
between electric particles, whose intensity depended
upon their relative motion as well as on their position.
This was, of course, more repugnant to Maxwell's mind
than the statical distance-action developed by Poisson.
The first paper of Maxwell's in which an attempt at an
admissible physical theory of electromagnetism was
made, was communicated to the Royal Society in 1867.
But the theory in a fully developed form, first appeared
in his great treatise on Electricity and Magnetism
(1873). Availing himself of the admirable generalized
coördinate system of Lagrange, Maxwell has shown
how to reduce all electric and magnetic phenomena to
stresses and motions of a material medium, and as one
preliminary, but excessively severe, test of the truth of
this theory has shown that, if the electromagnetic medium
be that which is required for the explanation of
the phenomena of light, the velocity of light in vacuo
should be numerically the same as the ratio of the electromagnetic
and electrostatic units. We do not as yet
certainly know either of these quantities very exactly,
but the mean values of the best determination of each
separately agree with one another more closely than do
the various values of either. There seems to be no longer
any possibility of doubt that Maxwell has taken the
first grand step towards the discovery of the true nature
of electrical phenomena. Had he done nothing but this,
his fame would have been secure for all time. But,
striking as it is, this forms only one small part of the
contents of his truly marvelous work."

Maxwell's prediction as to the propagation of electric
waves has received its full confirmation, as we have
said, in the brilliant experiments of Hertz, and in the
subsequent application of the Hertzian waves to wireless
telegraphy in our own time. It was not by mere
chance that this development of Maxwell's thinking
came. Hertz himself declared, in the introduction to
his collected papers, that he owed the suggestion of
his work to Faraday and Maxwell, and above all to
Maxwell's speculations as to the nature of electricity
and its relations to light. Hertz said:

"The hypothesis that light is an electric phenomenon
is thus made highly probable. To give a strict proof
of this hypothesis would logically require experiments
upon light itself. There is an obvious comparison between
the experiments and the theory, in connection
with which they were really undertaken. Since 1861,
science has been in possession of a theory which Maxwell
constructed upon Faraday's views, and which we
therefore call the Faraday-Maxwell theory. This theory
affirms the occurrence of the class of phenomena here
discovered, just as positively as the remaining electric
theories are compelled to deny it. From the outset,
Maxwell's theory excelled all others in its elaboration
and in the abundance of relations between the various
phenomena which it included."

How much Maxwell's work was appreciated across
the channel, may be realized from what Poincaré said:
"So sure did the results of his (Maxwell's) theory
appear as worked out for the deepest problems, that a
feeling of distrust and suspicion is likely to be mingled
with our admiration for his magnificent work. It is
only after prolonged study and at the cost of many
efforts that this feeling is dissipated."

Maxwell's explanation of electricity is that it is a
strain or stress in the ether, that it is a condition or
mode, and not a substance. One distinguished foreign
contemporary who had read Maxwell's books with the
greatest interest, declared that he could not be quite
satisfied, since nowhere did he find what a charge of
electricity is, though he seemed to find satisfactory
information with regard to everything else. Maxwell
realized, however, the limitations of his speculation very
well, and hesitated, above all, to bind his mathematical
conclusions to statements that might prove eventually
only surmises founded on insufficient information from
the standpoint of observation. Even when he gave his
explanation, he did not insist on it as absolute, but, as
pointed out by Poincaré, discussed it only as a possibility.
The French scientist said: "Maxwell does not
give a mechanical explanation of electricity and magnetism;
he is only concerned to show that such an explanation
is possible."

Maxwell thoroughly believed in having a hobby as
well as his regular work, and during the time while he
was devoting himself to the mathematical explanation
of electricity he turned for recreation to certain problems
in physics, in physiology and psychology, relating
to color. He worked almost as great a revolution in our
knowledge of color-vision as in any other subject that
he took up. Principal Garnett has condensed so well
what Clerk Maxwell accomplished in the matter of color-vision,
in his sketch of him in "The Heroes of Science,"[33]
that I prefer to quote his explanation. He
says:



"It has been stated that Thomas Young propounded a
theory of color-vision which assumes that there exists
three separate color sensations, corresponding to red,
green and violet, each having its own special organs,
the excitement of which causes the perception of the
corresponding color, other colors being due to the excitement
of two or more of these simple sensations in
different proportions. Maxwell adopted blue instead of
violet for the third sensation, and showed that, if a
particular red, green, and blue were selected and placed
at the angular points of an equilateral triangle, the
colors formed by mixing them being arranged as in
Young's diagram, all the shades of the spectrum would
be ranged along the sides of this triangle, the center
being neutral grey. For the mixing of colored lights,
he at first employed the color top; but instead of painting
circles with colored sectors, the angles of which
could not be changed, he used circular discs of colored
paper slit along one radius. Any number of such
discs can be combined so that each shows a sector at
the top, and the angle of each sector can be varied
at will by sliding the corresponding disc between the
others. Maxwell used discs of two different sizes, the
small discs being placed above the larger on the same
pivot, so that one set forked a central circle and the
other set a ring surrounding it. He found that, with
discs of five different colors, of which one might be
white and another black, it was always possible to combine
them so that the inner circle and the outer ring
exactly matched. From this he showed that there could
be only three conditions to be satisfied in the eye, for
two conditions were necessitated by the nature of the
top, since the smaller sectors must exactly fill the circle
and so must the larger. Maxwell's experiments, therefore,
confirmed, in general, Young's theory. They
showed, however, that the relative delicacy of the several
color sensations is different in different eyes, for
the arrangement which produced an exact match in the
case of one observer, had to be modified for another;
but this difference of delicacy proved to be very conspicuous
in color-blind persons, for in most of the cases
of color-blindness examined by Maxwell the red sensation
was completely absent, so that only two conditions
were required by color-blind eyes, and a match could
therefore always be made in such cases with four discs
only. Holmgren has since discovered cases of color-blindness
in which the violet sensation is absent. He
agrees with Young in making the third sensation correspond
to violet rather than blue. Maxwell explained
the fact that persons color-blind to the red divide colors
into blues and yellows, by the consideration that, although
yellow is a complex sensation corresponding to
a mixture of red and green, yet in nature, yellow tints
are so much brighter than greens, that they excite the
green sensation more than green objects themselves can
do; and hence greens and yellows are called yellow by
such color-blind persons, though their perception of
yellow is really the same as perception of green by
normal eyes. Later on, by a combination of adjustable
slits, prisms, and lenses arranged in a 'color box,' Maxwell
succeeded in mixing, in any desired proportions,
the light from any three portions of the spectrum, so
that he could deal with pure spectral colors instead of
the complex combinations of differently colored lights
afforded by colored papers. From these experiments, it
appears that no ray of the solar spectrum can affect one
color sensation alone, so that there are no colors in
nature so pure as to correspond to the pure simple sensations,
and the colors occupying the angular points of
Maxwell's diagram affect all three color sensations,
though they influence two of them to a much smaller
extent than the third. A particular color in the spectrum
corresponds to light which, according to the undulatory
theory, physically consists of waves, all of the
same period; but it may affect all three of the color sensations
of a normal eye, though in different proportions.
Thus yellow-light of a given wave-length affects the red
and green sensations considerably and the blue (or
violet) slightly, and the same effect may be produced by
various mixtures of red or orange and green."

For his researches on the perception of color, the
Royal Society awarded Clerk Maxwell the Rumford
Medal in 1860.

Besides this more or less theoretic work, however,
Maxwell made some interesting and important discoveries
and inventions in optics. For instance, he noted
the great differences that exist in the eyes of dark and
fair complexions to different colors when the light falls
upon the center of the yellow spot, the so-called fovea
centralis, or central pit of the retina. His researches
with regard to this led him to the discovery that this
portion of the retina is largely lacking in sensibility to
blue light. He was able to demonstrate this by his
experiment of looking through a glass vessel containing
a solution of chrome alum, when the central portion of
the field of vision appears of a light red color for the
first second or two. He was also the inventor of an ingenious
optical apparatus, a real image stereoscope. A
still more important discovery was that of the double
refraction which is produced for the time in viscous
liquids when they are stirred and their motion is not as
yet stopped. Maxwell showed that Canada balsam, for
instance, when stirred, acquired a distinct power of
double refraction, which it retained so long as the
stress in the fluid produced by stirring remained.

Other departments of physics were not neglected.
For instance, one of his greatest investigations was that
on the kinetic theory of gases. Geniuses had been
working before him on this line, for, as pointed out by
Professor Tait, this theory owed its origin to Daniel
Bernoulli, the greatest mathematician of the eighteenth
century, and had been developed by the successful
labors of Herapath, Joule and, above all, of Clausius.
The work of these men put the general accuracy of the
theory beyond all doubt and led to its very general
acceptance, yet the details of it needed to be elaborated
before it could become definitely scientific. Its greatest
developments are due to Maxwell, and in this field
Maxwell appeared as an experimenter on the laws of
gaseous friction as well as a mathematician. His work
with regard to color had showed his ingenuity as an
experimentalist, and this is still further illustrated by
his carefully arranged experiments on gases. Indeed,
his work in this line makes it very clear that nothing
was too difficult for him, and that anything that he
turned his hand to in the field of science he was sure to
accomplish with eminent success.

It was not only his scientific monographs, however,
that indicate how great a scientist Clerk Maxwell was,
but his text-books, even those of more or less elementary
character, which he wrote bring out this same idea.
He wrote, for instance, an admirable text-book on the
theory of heat, which went through many editions.
Students of the subject, even those who were not far
advanced, found it clear and easier of study than many
a less exhaustive work. He also wrote an elementary
treatise on matter and motion, which has gone through
several editions. One might think that so small a work
would scarcely interest him enough to tempt him to put
forth his powers at their best, and that at most it would
be a conventional condensation of previous knowledge.
Prof. Tait, who surely must be taken as a good judge in
the matter, says that "even this, like his other and
larger works, is full of valuable material worthy of the
most attentive perusal not of students alone, but of the
very foremost scientific men."

One of the characteristic traits of Maxwell was his
desire to impart information to others. This extended
not only to his academic relations, but, above all, to the
working classes, who might have few opportunities for
the obtaining of the information that was so interesting
with regard to natural subjects. Everywhere that he
held an academic post in his life, he gave lectures to the
workmen. He was an extremely interesting talker, and
one of his friends said of him: "I do believe there is
not a single subject on which he cannot talk, and talk
well, too, displaying always the most curious and out-of-the-way
information." One of his private tutors said
of him: "It is not possible for Maxwell to think incorrectly
on physical subjects." It is easy to understand,
then, how much his lectures to the working people at
Aberdeen, at Edinburgh, and at Kings College, London,
as well as at Cambridge, meant for them. If men like
Maxwell would take up the popularization of science
generally, then there would be much less opprobrium
attached to the expression popular science than there
has been only too often in the past, and is even at
present.

Just as Maxwell set himself to the solution of the
most difficult problems in physics, so he did not hesitate
to give himself also to the discussion of problems in
ethics. Here his power of penetration, the rigid logic
of his mind, and his power to follow out conclusions to
their ultimate significance, were quite as manifest as
any scientific writing. It is almost the rule to find that
scientists either ignore the great problems of man's
place in nature and his destiny, or treat them very
superficially. Agnosticism had become the fad of the
moment, and was just beginning to make itself felt as
a fashion in thinking when Clerk Maxwell was doing his
great work. Maxwell was not an agnostic in science,
and because he could not solve all the problems that
came to him with regard to electricity and the constitution
of matter, this did not keep him from setting
himself to the task of seeing what should be his thoughts
with regard to these subjects. He had none of the agnostic's
feelings with regard to them, that since we
cannot know all about them definitely and absolutely,
therefore it is not worth while studying them at all.
Had Maxwell been tempted to any such line of thought,
we would have missed some of the most helpful scientific
speculations and suggestions that have ever been
made.

No one knew better than Maxwell, that his speculations
on matter and electricity were theories, and that
what he was offering to science were not definite explanations,
but possible hypotheses. He has emphasized
this himself over and over again. This inability of the
human intellect at the present moment to solve all the
questions that its inquiring spirit can evoke, did not
keep him from investigating and following up his investigations
by mathematical deductions and mechanical
suggestions just as far as possible. He had the same
attitude of mind toward the great problems of man's
relation to his fellow-man, to the universe, and to a
hereafter. While he felt that he could not solve the
problems entirely, he felt also that his reasoning was
quite sufficient to enable him to get a little nearer to
the heart mystery of them and to understand something
of their significance. In his later years, the
question of the existence of pain and suffering in the
world had, because of Darwin's attitude towards them
and his declaration that since he was unable to understand
them they carried him away from the thought of a
beneficent Creator, attracted much attention. We have
an essay of Clerk Maxwell's, then, on "Aspects of
Pain," in which he discusses particularly pain as discipline.
It is, of course, the old story, that men rise on
stepping-stones of their dead selves, and that the successive
deaths of self represent a triumphant progress,
but it comes with a new vigor from this great scientist.
We all know that it is the man who has suffered who is
able to do things, and we are all well aware that the man
who has lived in comfort all his life is almost sure to be
lacking in character when a great crisis comes upon
him. Indeed, as Clerk Maxwell re-states it, this is
such a commonplace that one wonders why the problem
of pain should have seemed so hard to understand.

There is an essay of his, also, on "Science and Free
Will," which seems to deserve special notice. He has
no illusions with regard to determinism. He is perfectly
sure that he is free and that the great majority of men
around him do or do not things as they choose. He
points out that science makes for determinism only if
one takes a very narrow view of it. Free will is not
only compatible with scientific thinking, but it represents
what would be expected as a culmination of the
significance of life. In a word, Clerk Maxwell wrote
as suggestively with regard to the great problems of
human life as with regard to the physical nature around
him that claimed so much of his interest. He was a
true natural philosopher, and his interests were not
limited merely to the lower orders of beings.

Because of the supreme power of Clerk Maxwell's
mind to seek out the very heart of difficulties, the conclusions
which he reached with regard to the existence
of matter and the causes for the ultimate qualities which
it exhibits, have an enduring interest. Mathematics is
sometimes said to lead minds into scepticism. Cardinal
Newman even thought that the mathematical cast of
mind was the farthest removed from that which might be
expected to accept things confidently on faith. Clerk
Maxwell's intellect was eminently mathematical; yet, far
from sending him over into the camp of the agnostics,
his tendency to get at the ultimate reasons for things
seemed almost to push him to conclusions with regard to
the origin of matter, and especially its ultimate constituents,
not ordinarily supposed to be scientific. A passage
like the following, for instance, which may be found
in his book on "The Theory of Heat," London, 1872,
page 312, brings out this tendency very well:

"But if we suppose the molecules to be made at all,
or if we suppose them to consist of something previously
made, why should we expect any irregularity to exist
among them? If they are, as we believe, the only material
things which still remain in the precise condition in
which they first began to exist, why should we not
rather look for some indication of that spirit of order,
our scientific confidence in which is never shaken by the
difficulty which we experience in tracing it in the complex
arrangements of visible things, and of which our
moral estimation is shown in all our attempts to think
and speak the truth, and to ascertain the exact principles
of distributive justice?"

The argument from design for creation is often said
in our day to have lost its weight. For Clerk Maxwell,
however, this was evidently not the case. On the contrary,
he seemed to find in the detailed knowledge of the
ultimate constituents of matter which had come in recent
years, additional proofs of the great design which permeates
nature. He had come to the conclusion that not
only were the groups of atoms which make up living
things so ordered as to produce definite results, because
there was a great purpose and, above all, a great Designer
behind nature, but he also reached the position that
the separate atoms of matter were so ordered with regard
to one another, and in that ordering were so closely related
to corresponding qualities in higher beings, that
only the presence of a great design in nature could possibly
account for all these wonderful attributes, which
were to be found even in the smallest portions of matter.
He said in his article on the atom, in the ninth
edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica:

"What I thought of was not so much that uniformity
of result which is due to uniformity in the process of
formation, as a uniformity intended and accomplished
by the same wisdom and power of which uniformity,
accuracy, symmetry, consistency, and continuity of plan
are as important attributes as the contrivance of the
special utility of each individual thing."

Here is the old argument for the existence of God,
from the design exhibited in the universe, rehabilitated
by its application to the minutest portions of matter,
whose qualities demand such an explanation quite as
much as the highest adaptations of nature.

Perhaps the most striking expression of all with regard
to the atoms that Clerk Maxwell permitted himself,
is that in which he finds the type of what is best in man,
in every minute portion of the universe, planted there
by the Creator just as surely as they are in His highest
beings, because they represent the most precious
qualities of His own nature as they are reflected in the
creation that He called into existence.

"They (the atoms) continue this day as they were
created, perfect in number and measure and weight, and
from the ineffaceable characters impressed on them we
may learn that those aspirations, after accuracy in
measurement, truth in statement, and justice in action,
which we reckon among our noblest attributes as men,
are ours because they are essential constituents of the
image of Him Who in the beginning created not only the
heaven and the earth, but the materials of which heaven
and earth consist."

A very interesting side of Maxwell's life is that which
shows his continued interest in literature, and even his
occasional dippings into poetry. Though he reached
distinction in mathematics and physics so early in his
career, he yet found time to indulge a liking for the
classics, and we even find some rather good translations
of Horace's odes from his pen. The translation of a part
of the Ajax of Sophocles from the Greek is a striking
testimony to the breadth of Maxwell's intellectual interests.
All during life, however, he permitted himself
occasionally the luxury of fitting words into verse forms,
and sometimes with a success that deserves much more
than passing interest. It is very probable that the following
verses, for instance, which are the first and last
stanzas of a poem on the formula for being happy in life
and were meant to be sung (or at least so he would hint)
to the tune of "Il segreto per esser felice," will strike
many a sympathetic chord in the modern time.


There are some folks that say
They have found out a way
To be healthy and wealthy and wise:       
"Let your thoughts be but few,
Do as other folks do,
And never be caught by surprise.

Let your motto be follow the fashion,
But let other people alone;
Do not love them nor hate them nor care for their fate,
But keep a lookout for your own.
Then what though the world may run riot,
Still playing at catch who catch can,
You may just eat your dinner in quiet
And live like a sensible man."

In Nature I read quite a different creed,
There everything lives in the rest;
Each feels the same force
As it moves in its course,
And all by one blessing are blest.
The end that we live for is single,
But we labor not therefor alone;
For together we feel how by wheel within wheel
We are helped by a force not our own.
So we flee not the world and its dangers,
For He that has made it is wise;
He knows we are pilgrims and strangers,
And He will enlighten our eyes.


There probably was not a more nicely logical or more
accurately reasoning intellect among all our nineteenth
century scientists than that of the great mathematical
electrician. He had none of the one-sidedness of the
merely experimental scientist, nor, on the other hand,
the narrowness of the exclusively speculative philosopher.
With a power of analysis that was seldom equaled
during the century, he had a power of synthesis that
probably surpassed any of his contemporaries in any
part of Europe. His ideas with regard to matter and its
ultimate constitution are most suggestive. His suggestion
of a strain in the ether as an explanation of electricity,
thus enabling scientists to get away from the
curious theories of the foretime which had required them
to accept "action at a distance," that is, without any
connecting medium, shows his power of following out
abstruse ideas to definite practical conclusions. His religious
life, then, will be a surprise to those who think
that science leads men away from religion.

In the life of Clerk Maxwell, written by Campbell and
Garnett,[34] there is a passage from his friend and sometime
pastor, Guillemard, in which the details of his religious
life are given so fully as scarcely to require any
further gleaning of information in this regard.

"He was a constant, regular attendant at church, and
seldom, if ever, failed to join in our monthly late celebration
of Holy Communion, and he was a generous
contributor to all our parish charitable institutions.
But his illness drew out the whole heart and soul and
spirit of the man; his firm and undoubting faith in the
Incarnation and all its results; in the full sufficing of
atonement; in the works of the Holy Spirit. He had
gauged and fathomed all the schemes and systems of
philosophy, and had found them utterly empty and unsatisfying       'unworkable'
was his own word about them       and
he turned with simple faith to the Gospel of the
Saviour."

His faith was not disturbed at the near approach of
death, but, on the contrary, seemed strengthened. His
biographers tell the story of some of the expressions
used to his friends during these last days, which furnish
manifest proof of this. Some of these passages are so
characteristic and so striking that they deserve to be in
the note-book of those to whom the modern idea that
science is opposed to religion or faith may sometimes
have been a source of worry, or at least an occasion for
argument. Here is a typical one of these passages:

"Mr. Colin Mackenzie has repeated to us two sayings
of his during those last days, which may be repeated
here: 'Old chap, I have read up many queer religions;
there is nothing like the old thing, after all; and I have
looked into most philosophical systems, and I have seen
that none will work without a God.'"

It must not be imagined, because Clerk Maxwell was
a deeply religious man, that, therefore, he was frigid
or formal or extremely serious, or inclined to be puritanic
with regard to the pleasures of life, or a fanatic in
the matter of taking all the good-natured fun there
might be in anything that turned up. He was far from
over-serious, or what has been called, though not quite
properly, ascetic; but, on the contrary, was often, indeed
usually, the soul of the party with which he was at
the moment. He had none at all of the self-centered
interest of the narrow-minded, but had many friends,
and was liked by all his acquaintances. His friends were
enthusiastic about his kindness of heart and the thorough
congeniality of his disposition. On this point, the
sketch of him in the National Dictionary of Biography
gives a charming picture:

"As a man, Maxwell was loved and honored by all
who knew him; to his pupils, he was the kindest and
most sympathetic of teachers; to his friends, he was the
most charming of companions, brimful of fun, the life
and soul of a Red Lion dinner at the British Association
meetings; but in due season brave and thoughtful, with
keen interest in problems that lay outside the domain
of his own work, and throughout his life a stern foe to
all that was superficial or untrue. On religious questions,
his beliefs were strong and deeply rooted."

It may be added to this, that his religion had nothing
of the merely formal about it, nor was it perfunctory.
It entered into most of the details of his life, and the
fact that, every day as the head of the house he led
evening prayers for the family, was only a token of the
deep hold which religion had upon his life. When his
last illness came, though he knew that his end was not
far off, and at his age sometimes the approach of death
hampers religious faith because it does seem that longer
life might be afforded to one who has been so faithful in
his realization of the obligations of life, Clerk Maxwell's
piety increased rather than diminished. A favorite expression
of his during his last days was the verselet from
Richard Baxter, which one would be apt to think of as
frequently repeated by some feminine devotee rather
than by the greatest mathematical scientist of the nineteenth
century:


"Lord, it belongs not to my care,
Whether I die or live;
To love and serve Thee is my share,
And that Thy grace must give."


A friend who knew him intimately says: "In private
life, Clerk Maxwell was one of the most lovable of men, a
sincere and unostentatious Christian. Though perfectly
free from any trace of envy or ill-will, he yet showed on
fit occasions his contempt for that pseudo-science which
seeks for the applause of the ignorant by professing to
reduce the whole system of the universe to a fortuitous
sequence of uncaused events."

In these phases of his intellectual life, the greatest of
the mathematical electricians of the nineteenth century
deserves to be taken as the type of the man of science,
rather than the many mediocre intelligences whose
minds were not large enough apparently for the two sets
of truths       those of the moral as well as of the physical
order.

CHAPTER XII.
Lord Kelvin.



Lord Kelvin


Few men lived to witness so many remarkable discoveries
in science and so many applications of the same
to the welfare of the race as did the man whose name
stands at the head of this chapter. When William
Thomson, the future Lord Kelvin, first saw the light of
day, the voltaic pile was in a rudimentary and inefficient
form. It is true that water had been decomposed
by the current from a pile in 1800,[35] that the magnetic
effect of the current had been discovered in 1820, and
the possibility of a practical form of an electric telegraph
suggested in the same year; but Ohm's law was
still one of nature's secrets, electromagnetic induction
was undiscovered, and the doctrine of energy but ill
understood. Light, electricity and magnetism were regarded
as distinct forces, and heat was thought to be a
material substance, to which the name caloric was assigned.
What Young, Fresnel and Ampère were in the
early years of the nineteenth century; what Faraday,
Regnault and Joseph Henry were some time later, Kelvin
became in the 'fifties, a leader in the intellectual and
scientific life of the time, a leader destined to extend
the frontiers of knowledge, to establish an accurate system
of electrical measurement, and to enrich the world
with instruments of marvelous ingenuity and precision.

William Thomson, born in Belfast in 1824, received
his early training in the Royal Academic Institute of
that city. When eight years of age, he left his native
land, exchanging the shores of Antrim for the banks of
the Clyde. His father, James Thomson, a mathematician
of note, having been appointed to the chair of
mathematics in the University of Glasgow (founded in
1451), proceeded early in the summer of 1832 to the
commercial metropolis of Scotland, accompanied by his
two sons William and James, both of whom were destined
to add lustre to the family name.

After a period of preparatory study, the two brothers,
who were ten and eleven years of age, respectively,
matriculated at the university. With the iron-clad regulations
that govern admission to American colleges and
universities, these boys would at best have been admitted
to one of our high schools, and kept there until
they reached the maturity required by the age limit.
By the time young William attained that limit, he had
already finished his work at the university, and captured
the first prizes in mathematics, astronomy and
natural philosophy. He was then only sixteen years of
age, small of stature, but a giant in intellect; brilliant,
versatile, and with a passion for work. It was his good
fortune, also, to come under the influence of a great
teacher, in the person of Prof. Nichol. "I have to
thank what I heard in the natural philosophy class," he
said in 1903, "for all I did in connection with submarine
cables. The knowledge of Fourier was my start in the
theory of signaling through submarine cables, which
occupied a large part of my after-life. The inspiring
character of Dr. Nichol's personality and his bright
enthusiasm live still in my mental picture of those old
days."

Having heard Fourier's treatise on the mathematical
theory of heat spoken of one day as a remarkable and
inspiring work, young Thomson astonished the Professor
when, at the end of the lecture, he addressed Dr.
Nichol with the query, "Do you think that I could read
it?" To which the Professor smilingly replied: "Well,
the mathematical part is very difficult." Many a student
would have left Fourier alone for the nonce, after
listening to a statement so little calculated to excite
courage or awaken interest: but Thomson was not an
ordinary student; and, however forbidding the answer
which he received, he was determined all the same to
handle the volume and seek its inspiration. Without
delay, he got the book from the university library, and
grew so delighted with the new ideas of the French
mathematician about sine-expansions and cosine-expansions,
that in the space of two weeks he had "turned
over all the pages" of the book, as he modestly put it.

In the summer of 1840, he accompanied his father and
his brother on a tour through Germany, partly to see
the country and partly also, to acquire a practical knowledge
of the language. In both these objects, he was
somewhat hindered by his fondness for mathematical
studies, which led him to include in his impedimenta for
the trip a copy of Fourier's Théorie analytique de la
Chaleur. Most students out on a summer's vacation,
especially in foreign parts, would doubtless have preferred
to give their minds rest and congenial distraction
rather than keep on reading and pondering over
abstract mathematical concepts. Our young tourist, on
the other hand, seems to have thought of little else than
of Fourier's "mathematical poem," as Clerk Maxwell
called the work, a "poem" that continued to have a
charm for him all through life. It is a noteworthy fact
that Thomson continually returned to the ideas and
methods of this suggestive treatise on the flow of heat,
and that he applied them with great success to problems
in thermal conductivity, in electricity and in submarine
telegraphy.

Shortly after returning home, Thomson was sent to
the University of Cambridge, where he entered St.
Peter's College, commonly called Peterhouse, one of the
oldest colleges of the university, its foundation dating
back to the year 1284. Though he, no doubt, followed
in a general way the directions given him by William
Hopkins, "the best of private tutors," and kept in view
the requirements of the honors examination, called the
"Mathematical Tripos," for which he intended to present
himself at the end of his course, he found his studies
somewhat routinal and uninspiring. Original work was
more to his taste than conventional subjects; his tutor,
however, thought mainly of placing this brilliant pupil
at the head of the wranglers, and hailing him the senior
wrangler of the year, for which purpose, the beaten track
must be followed, the standard works read, favorite problems
worked out, short-cuts conned and rapidity of output
exercised. Stokes, of Pembroke, had been senior
wrangler in 1841; Cayley, of Trinity, in 1842; and
Adams, of John's, in 1843; why not Thomson, of Peterhouse,
in 1845, argued Hopkins, who had the distinction
of being second wrangler of the previous year?

But when the ordeal was over and the work of all
candidates appraised, Thomson's name was second on
the list, with Parkinson, of John's, at the top. Hopkins
was disappointed, as he had a right to be, for it was
thought by many and said by some that Parkinson was
not fit to sharpen Thomson's pencils. At the examination
for the Smith's prizes, which immediately followed,
and which was generally regarded as a higher honor
and a better test of original ability, the order was reversed,
and Thomson's star blazed out with the brilliancy
of the first magnitude.

We have here an instructive instance of the failure of
an examination to place rightly the most gifted man;
that of Sylvester, in 1837, and Clerk Maxwell, in 1854,
both of whom were second wranglers, are equally so.
Examinations, however, seldom fail in justly rating
candidates when originality is not a necessary qualification,
but only a sound knowledge and liberal interpretation
of the subjects laid down in the syllabus; a
good memory and rapidity of writing will do the rest.

Thomson committed the fatal mistake in the tripos
examination of devoting too much time to a particular
question in which he was deeply interested. It was a
curious coincidence that the solution which Parkinson
sent in to the same question was almost identical with
that of his rival for mathematical honors. On being
questioned about the matter by the Moderators, Parkinson
said that he had read the solution some time before
in the Cambridge Mathematical Journal; Thomson's
explanation was that the solution given in the Journal
was his! As he had not memorized the details, he was
obliged of course to work the problem out de novo.

Parkinson in later years wrote a treatise on elementary
mechanics that has long since made way for others;
Thomson, on the other hand, published in collaboration
with Tait a Treatise on Natural Philosophy for advanced
students, which became at once the accepted standard.
Throughout this treatise, the view is emphasized
that physics deals with realities more than with theories,
with mutual relations more than with their mathematical
expression. Helmholtz thought so highly of this
work that he translated it into German, saying in his
preface: "William Thomson, one of the most penetrating
and ingenious thinkers, deserves the thanks of the
scientific world, in that he takes us into the workshop
of his thoughts and unravels the guiding threads which
have helped him to master and set in order the most resisting
and confused material." And again: "Following
the example given by Faraday, he avoids as far as
possible hypotheses about unknown subjects, and endeavors
to express by his mathematical treatment of
problems simply the law of observable phenomena."

We are not to think of Thomson, the undergraduate,
as of one who gave himself up, mind and body, to his
favorite studies; he knew how to combine, in some
measure, the dulce with the utile, for he was fond of
music, and so proficient in the art that he was elected
President of the Musical Society. He also took a practical
interest in aquatic sports, and on the Cam he could
ply his sculls with the best of the men. Indeed, he was
fond of the water all through life, his Lalla Rookh
being well known on the Clyde and in the Solent.
Expert in the navigation of his yacht, he liked to be
out on the deep, caressed by wind and buffeted by
wave, on which occasions he usually studied, pencil in
hand, problems connected with navigation and hydrodynamics.

Thomson was never without his note-book. Even in
his journeys to London, when he usually took the night
train to save time, his mind was active, and the green-book
was in frequent requisition to receive thoughts
that occurred relative to problems that engaged his
attention. Unlike many mortals, he was able to sleep
soundly on those night trips, although in the early days
he had none of the luxuries of traveling which we consider
indispensable to our comfort.

Helmholtz records that, being on the Lalla Rookh on
one occasion, Thomson "carried the freedom of intercourse
so far that he always had a mathematical
note-book with him; and as soon as an idea occurred to
him, he began to reckon right in the midst of company."
This reminds us of the answer which Newton
gave to a friend who asked him how he accomplished so
much. "By constantly thinking of it," was the brief
reply. Concentration of the faculties is necessary for
all good work; a distracted mind never achieved anything
of value in philosophy, in science, in religious worship.
Concentration is like a convex lens, which brings
rays to a focus; whereas distraction is like a concave
lens, which breaks them up into a number of divergent
and scattered elements.

On leaving Cambridge in 1845, Thomson proceeded to
London, and was warmly received by Faraday, then of
world-wide reputation. He next went to Paris, where,
in the laboratory of Regnault, he devoted himself to
original research, under the direction of that great and
accurate physicist who was then carrying out his
classic work on the thermal constants of bodies.

The year 1846 marks an epoch in Thomson's life; for,
in that year, he was chosen to succeed Nichol, his
friend and master, in the chair of natural philosophy in
the University of Glasgow. Though only in his twenty-second
year, he chose for the subject of his inaugural
address the age of the earth, a subject which continued
to have a life-long interest for him because of its very
fascination, and perhaps, too, because of the opposition
which his views aroused on the part of biologists and
geologists. These demanded untold æons for the original
fire-mist to cool down and form a spinning globe fit
to be the abode of organic life, whereas Thomson endeavored
to show the weakness of the arguments which
they advanced to uphold their claim for unlimited time.
Basing his estimate on the rate of increase of temperature
as we go below the earth's surface, he concluded
that the earth required from 100 to 200 million years,
and probably less, to cool from its molten state to its
present condition.

Impressed by the value of the experimental work
which he did under Regnault in Paris, Prof. Thomson
gave himself no rest until he secured a place in which
the demonstrations of the lecture-room could be supplemented
by qualitative and quantitative work in the
laboratory. This was the first "physical laboratory"
open to students in Great Britain, a fact that makes the
year 1846 a memorable one in the history of university
development. Two apartments were allotted him for
experimental purposes, viz., an abandoned wine-cellar
and a disused examination-room, to which, as time
went on, were added a corridor, some spare attics, and
even the university tower itself, so great was the power
of annexation possessed by the young Professor. In
those dark and cheerless rooms, a few old instruments
were installed, after which students were invited and
work begun. A band of men, whose ardor was enkindled
by the glowing enthusiasm of the presiding genius,
gathered around him, and helped him to carry out investigations
on the properties of metals, on moduli of
elasticity, elastic fatigue and atmospheric electricity.
Among this band of earnest students it will suffice to
mention the names of the late Prof. Ayrton, an eminent
electrician; Prof. John Perry, known for his Homeric
battles in favor of reform in the teaching of mathematics;
Sir William Ramsay, the discoverer of the
"newer" gases of the atmosphere; and Prof. Andrew
Gray, who succeeded his master in the University of
Glasgow.

Writing of his laboratory experiences, Prof. Ramsay
says: "I remember that my first exercise, which occupied
over a week, was to take the kinks out of a bundle
of copper wire. Having achieved this with some success,
I was placed opposite a quadrant electrometer and made
to study its construction and use." "Although this
method," he adds, "is not without its disadvantages       for
systematic instruction is of much value       there is
something to be said for it. On the one hand, too long
a course of experimenting on old and well known lines
is likely to imbue the young student with the idea that
all physics consists in learning the use of apparatus and
repeating measurements which have already been made.
On the other hand, too early attempts to investigate
the unknown are likely to prove fruitless for want of
manipulative skill and for want of knowledge of what
has already been done."

Prof. Gray wrote: "In the physical laboratory, Prof.
Thomson was both inspiring and distracting. He continually
thought of new things to be tried, and interrupted
the course of work with interpolated experiments
which often robbed the previous sequence of operations
of their final result."

It may bring a grain of consolation to teachers who
meet with troublesome elements in the discharge of their
duties, to know that Thomson, great and brilliant as he
was, had similar experiences now and again. At one
time a book of mathematical data would be removed
from the place assigned to it, upon which he would give
orders that it should be chained to the table; at others,
there would be no chalk near the blackboard, and then
the assistant would be solemnly instructed to have one
hundred pieces available next time. On one occasion,
he settled in a very novel manner the case of a student
who insisted on disturbing the class by moving his foot
back and forth on the floor. Calling his assistant,
Thomson told him in a whisper to go down into the room
under the tiers of seats, to listen attentively, and locate
the wandering foot by its distance from two adjacent
walls of the building. On his return to the lecture-room,
the triumphant assistant gave the desired coordinates to
the Professor, who took out his tape at once and measured
off the distances, by which the outwitted offender
was mathematically located. In obedience to orders, the
latter rose and left the room, muttering a few graceful
epithets as he went, in honor of Descartes, the
founder of a system of geometry that could serve so
well the twofold purpose of the detective and the
mathematician.

It was the custom in Glasgow to open the daily sessions,
morning and afternoon, with prayer, the selection
of which was left to the discretion of the Professor.
Thomson usually recited from memory the third collect
from the morning service of the Church of England, to
which he sometimes added reflections of his own for
the spiritual benefit of his hearers.

In his teaching, Prof. Thomson was particularly
insistent that his students should not bow their intellects
in mute admiration before an array of mathematical
symbols; but that, on all occasions, they should seek
the physical meaning behind them. Writing on his
blackboard one day dx/dt, he was not satisfied when
told that it represented the ratio of the increment of x to
the increment of the independent variable t (time); he
wanted the student to say it represents velocity. He
himself was so wont to look for the physical meaning
of symbols that, like the prophets of old, he saw many
things that were hidden from the eyes of ordinary
mortals.

He had the rare gift of translating mathematical
equations into real facts; and he strove all throughout
his life, by word and writing, to purify mathematical
theory from mere assumptions. He often said that he
could not understand a thing until he was able to make,
or at least conceive, a model of it.

He had a "keen mathematical instinct," as Prof.
Silvanus P. Thomson puts it in a letter to the writer, an
insight that "grew to see things." He often left matters
in the dark for years, then returned to see them in the
clear light of truth. At the age of sixteen, he wrote a
mathematical essay on the figure of the earth; and at
eighty-three, took it up again in order to add a note to
the argument!

Thomson was discursive in his lectures, and was
never able to boil the matter down to suit the taste and
digestive powers of the ordinary student. The activity
of his mind and its fecundity were such that new ideas,
new problems, new modes of treatment were continually
occurring, and with such fascination that he would
leave the main subject to indulge in what often proved
prolonged digressions. One of his bugbears was our
system of weights and measures, which he denounced
in season and out of season as "insane," "brain-wasting"
and "dangerous." Occasionally epithets of a
more caloric nature would escape the lips of the indignant
Professor, who, as a consequence of his denunciation,
had always to be indulgent to students who
chanced to be shaky in the matter of Troy weight,
avoirdupois weight or even apothecaries weight.

In later years, I heard Lord Kelvin at the Royal Institution,
London, on some of his favorite dynamical
subjects, such as the gyrostat, vortex rings and the
like. However impressed by his keen eye, intellectual
forehead, his mastery of the subject and wealth of
illustration, I was no less impressed by his vivacity, his
enthusiasm and the rapidity with which he could leave
a train of thought and return to it again.

At meetings of the British Association, he always had
something illuminating to say; but not infrequently,
carried away by a torrent of ideas, he would indulge in
a superfluity of detail, forgetting that other speakers
had to be heard and other papers read.

The idea of connecting the Old World with the New
by means of an electric cable laid on the bed of the
ocean, seemed to most people in the 'fifties quixotic and
utopian. Manufacturers said such a cable could not be
made; engineers, that it could not be laid; electricians,
that it could not be worked; and financiers, that if laid
and worked, it would never pay. But with a Field to
look after the financial interests of the scheme, and a
Thomson to attend to electrical quantities, there was no
tilting at windmills, and the utopian scheme became in
due time the cable whose core pulsated with the news
of the world.

As early as 1850, Bishop Mullock, of St. John's, N.
F., addressed to an American newspaper, called the
Courier, a letter in which he advocated a telegraph
line from Newfoundland to New York, so that the news
of mail steamers could be intercepted and wired to that
City. In 1852, the "Newfoundland Electric Telegraph
Company" was formed for the purpose of carrying out a
similar plan. This was to be accomplished by means of
a telegraph line from Cape Race, at the eastern extremity
of Newfoundland to Cape Ray, on the western,
as well as by short cables over to Cape Breton Island, to
Prince Edward Island and the mainland, and thence by
ordinary telegraph lines to Canada and the United
States. But owing to the want of money, nothing was
done.

The first attempt at laying a cable under the Atlantic
was made by the Atlantic Telegraph Company in 1857,
after a careful survey of the ocean had revealed the existence
of a submarine plain, or extended table-land, on
which the cable could rest undisturbed by passing keels,
monsters of the deep or angry billows. The result was
the first of a series of failures, which caused great perplexity
and depression at the time; for, after 330 miles
had been paid out from Valentia on the Irish coast, the
cable suddenly parted, burying in 2000 fathoms of water
an electrical conductor which had cost $150,000 for its
manufacture.

A second attempt was made in 1858, when the U. S.
frigate Niagara and H. M. S. Agamemnon, each carrying
half of the cable, met in mid-ocean; and, after
splicing the two ends together, steamed away in opposite
directions, the Niagara toward Newfoundland and the
Agamemnon toward Valentia. Fortunately for the enterprise,
Prof. Thomson was on board the English ship as
chief electrician. No doubt, his mind turned many a
time during those anxious days to Fourier's differential
equation for the flow of heat along a conductor, and his
own application of it to the conduction of the electric
current through the copper core of the cable as it came
up from the tanks, trailed out behind the ship, dipped
silently into the blue water and slowly settled down to
its bed of ooze on the ocean floor.

After a series of disheartening mishaps, necessitating
as many returns of the ships to the rendezvous in mid-ocean,
the Agamemnon landed the shore-end safely in
Valentia; and the Niagara, after rolling and pitching
for days and nights in tempestuous seas, landed hers in
Trinity Bay on the morning of August 5th, 1858, on
which historic date the telegraphic union of the two
worlds was finally consummated and the great feat of
the century accomplished.

Though not fully realized at the time by the capitalists
who financed his scheme, by the engineers and electricians
who carried it out, or even by statesmen, economists
and social reformers, the slender copper cord,
buried away from human ken amidst the débris of
minute organisms, was destined to effect a revolution in
the affairs of men greater than any achieved by the
wisdom of sages or the policy of legislators.

Owing to the electrostatic capacity of the cable, signaling
would have been difficult and unsatisfactory had
it not been for the resourcefulness of Prof. Thomson,
who devised his reflecting galvanometer to serve as
receiving instrument. The principle of the mirror applied
in this way was not new, for it had been suggested
by Poggendorff and even used by Gauss in connection
with very heavy magnets. The magnets used by Thomson,
on the other hand, were strips of watch-spring
weighing about a grain each, so that even a very weak
current coming through the cable would be sufficient to
produce strong displacements of the spot of light on the
scale. Thomson was clearly the first to insist on small
dimensions in magnetic instruments, and to show that
reduction in size would be attended with corresponding
increase in sensitiveness.

The mirror galvanometer, surrounded with a thick
iron case to screen it from the magnetic field due to the
iron of the ship, the "iron-clad galvanometer" as it was
called, was used for the first time on the telegraphic
expedition of 1858.

The instrument itself, which was fitted up on board
the Niagara and which was connected with so many
episodes of thrilling interest, was placed by Prof. Thomson
in the collection of historical apparatus in the University
of Glasgow, where it is at the present day.

Beautiful as was the invention of the mirror galvanometer,
it gave neither warning of the beginning of a
message nor a permanent record of it. Sitting in his
dark room, the operator had to be always on the alert
for the first swing of the spot of light over the scale.
To obviate these drawbacks, Thomson, after some thinking
and more talking with his friend White, of Glasgow,
finally patented the siphon-recorder, in which a glass
siphon of capillary dimensions is pulled to the right or
left by the action of the current flowing through a light
movable coil, and is thus made to register signals in ink
on a vertical strip of paper which is kept in uniform
motion by a train of clockwork. It is by this simple
but very ingenious instrument that messages are received
and recorded to-day at all the cable-stations of
the world.

The inaugural message through the cable came from
the Directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company in
Great Britain to the Directors in America, saying:
"Europe and America are united by telegraph; glory to
God in the highest, on earth peace and good will toward
men."

The message from Queen Victoria to President Buchanan,
consisting of 95 words, took 67 minutes in transmission;
it read:

"The Queen desires to congratulate the President
upon the successful completion of this great international
work, in which the Queen has taken the deepest interest.

"The Queen is convinced that the President will join
with her in fervently hoping that the electric cable
which now connects Great Britain with the United States
will prove an additional link between the nations whose
friendship is founded upon their common interests and
reciprocal esteem.

"The Queen has much pleasure in thus communicating
with the President, and renewing to him her wishes for
the prosperity of the United States."

The reply of President Buchanan was as follows:

"The President cordially reciprocates the congratulations
of Her Majesty, the Queen, on the success of the
great international enterprise accomplished by the
science, skill and indomitable energy of the two countries.
It is a triumph more glorious, because far more
useful to mankind, than was ever won by conqueror on
the field of battle.

"May the Atlantic telegraph, under the blessing of
Heaven, prove to be a bond of perpetual peace and
friendship between the kindred nations, and an instrument
destined by Divine Providence to diffuse religion,
civilization, liberty and law throughout the world. In
this view will not all nations of Christendom spontaneously
unite in the declaration that it shall be forever
neutral, and that its communications shall be held sacred
in passing to their places of destination, even in the
midst of hostilities?"

The historian of the enterprise was Mr. John Mullaly,
of New York, who was on the Niagara as secretary to
Prof. Morse and subsequently to Mr. Cyrus W. Field
and correspondent of the New York Herald. He has
published three interesting works on the subject: a Trip
to Newfoundland, with an account of the laying of the
submarine Cable (between Port au Basque and North
Sydney), 1855; The Ocean Telegraph, 1858; and The first
Atlantic Telegraph Cable, a pamphlet of 28 pages, reprinted
from the "Journal of the Franklin Institute,"
1907. From it, we learn that Archbishop Hughes was
one of the principal American subscribers to the capital
of the Atlantic Cable Company.

When, in 1855, the subject of laying a cable under the
Atlantic ocean began to be seriously considered, Thomson,
who was then only 31 years of age, discussed in a
series of masterly papers the theory of signaling through
such conductors, showing inter alia that the instruments
used on land-lines would be inoperative on cables, and
also that the same speed of transmission could not be
attained on cables as on ordinary telegraph lines. It
was shown at the same time, that these differences are
due to the fact that, unlike an air-line, the cable is an
electrical condenser in which the copper core is separated
from the waters of the ocean by a layer of gutta percha,
a nonconducting material. As a submerged cable is,
therefore, a long Leyden jar of great electrical capacity,
it follows that a signal sent in at the American end will
not reach the other instantly; for while the current flows
along the conductor, it has also to charge up the cable
as it progresses, which operation retards the signals,
and also deprives them of the clearness and sharpness
with which they were sent. The phenomenon is analogous
to the diffusion of heat along a bar, the temperature
of the various cross-sections rising in gradual succession
until the distant end is reached. The mathematical
investigations of Thomson showed the necessity
of working slowly, and of using weak currents as well
as very delicate receiving instruments. The interval of
time required for the transmission of a signal from Newfoundland
to Valentia is about one second.

Some years later, in 1858, Thomson had the opportunity
of putting his theoretical views to the test of experiment
on a grand, commercial scale, and had the satisfaction
of finding that all his conclusions were confirmed.
Electricians of the early period distrusted the inexperienced
young man who had never erected a mile
of telegraph line or even served for a month in a telegraph
office; but their distrust was followed by admiration
when they saw the efficient manner in which he
handled every problem and dealt with every difficulty
that occurred while laying the cable of 1858. It was
generally admitted that, had it not been for the brilliant
work of the young Glasgow Professor, many years
would have passed away before the Old World and the
New would have been brought into telegraphic communication.

Like all interested in the enterprise, Thomson was
greatly shocked when the news reached him that signals
could no longer be transmitted through the cable, which,
after costing so much money, so much thought and
labor, now lay a useless thing in two and a half miles
of water. Attempts were made to raise it, but without
success.

During its short life of less than a month, 366 messages
were flashed through the cable, aggregating 4359
words of 21,421 letters.

The failure of the pioneer cable has been attributed
to a variety of causes, chief of which were defective
construction and imperfect paying-out machinery, which
produced unequal strains in the cable. Defective
as the cable was at the moment of immersion, the various
troubles became intensified with time, until at last,
when provoked by the feebleness of the signals, the injudicious
electrician at Valentia had recourse to the
great penetrative power of the induction coil, and
gave the dying cable the coup de grâce.

An experiment made by Mr. Latimer Clark is not only
germane to the subject, but is also of very great interest.
Writing from Valentia on Sept. 12th, 1866, Mr.
Latimer Clark says: "With a single galvanic cell, composed
of a few drops of acid in a silver thimble[36] and a
fragment of zinc, weighing a grain or two, conversation
may easily, though slowly, be carried on through one
of the cables (1865, 1866) or through the two joined together
at Newfoundland; and although in the latter
case, the spark, twice traversing the breadth of the
Atlantic, has to pass through 3700 miles of cable, its
effects at the receiving end are visible in the galvanometer
in a little more than a second after contact is
made with the battery. The deflections are not of a
dubious character, but full and long, the spot of light
traversing freely a space of 12 in. or 13 in. on the scale;
and it is manifest that a battery many times smaller
would suffice to produce similar effects."

Not to be outdone by the English electrician, Mr.
William Dickerson devised the gun-cap cell, which he
used in 1866 with success in transmitting signals from
Heart's Content, Newfoundland, to Valentia on the
Irish coast.

A piece of No. 16 bare copper wire was procured, one
end of which was firmly twisted around the head of an
empty percussion-cap. To one end of another similar
length of wire was bound, with fine copper wire, a short
strip of zinc bent at a right angle to form the anode
element of the diminutive cell. After charging the cell
with a drop of acidulated water of the size of an ordinary
well-formed tear, and properly connecting the
terminals with earth and cable, signals were transmitted
over the cable by the infinitesimal current generated
by this novel cell. The receiving operator reported that
the signals were "awfully small"; but they were intelligible,
and messages were successfully transmitted
under the ocean by this tiny element.

Contrast with this Lilliputian cell the enormous power
that was used on the cable of 1858 toward the end of its
short existence, when batteries of 380 and 420 Daniell
cells were employed to force signals across.

When, in 1865, it was decided to make another attempt
at laying a cable under the Atlantic, Prof. Thomson,
whose reputation was enhanced during the seven intervening
years by a number of communications on the
theory and practice of submarine telegraphy, was again
retained as scientific expert in a consultative sense, with
Mr. Cromwell F. Varley as chief electrician. In accordance
with the costly experience that had been gained,
a new cable was made and coiled on board the Great
Eastern,[37] a leviathan which was well fitted for the work
by the great man       uvring power afforded by its screw
and paddles combined. Leaving Valentia, the big ship
steamed with her prow to the west at a slow rate of
speed, in order to give the cable time to sink beneath
the waves and adapt itself to the configuration of the
ocean floor. Eleven hundred miles had been successfully
paid out when, to the consternation of all, the
cable suddenly snapped and disappeared in more than
two miles of water. Attempts were made during the
next nine days to recover it from those abysmal depths;
and, though grappled many times during those trying
hours, it gave way each time under the strain to which
it was subjected. Like its predecessors of 1857 and
1858, the cable of 1865 was finally abandoned to its fate,
and the Great Eastern returned home with three
greatly disappointed men on board, viz., Prof. Thomson,
Mr. C. F. Varley and Captain (later Sir James)
Anderson.

In the following year, a sum of three-quarters of a
million sterling, nearly $4,000,000, was offered to the
Directors of the "Telegraph Construction Company" if
they would complete the cable of 1865 and lay a new
one. After consultation and careful consideration, the
offer was accepted and the cable constructed according
to the best engineering knowledge available.

In 1866, Prof. Thomson was again on board the Great
Eastern with Captain Anderson; and this time the
big ship had snugly coiled up in her deep, cavernous
tanks the cable that was destined to put Europe and
America in permanent telegraphic communication.
With a well-manufactured cable, improved paying-out
machinery and an experienced staff of mechanical engineers,
not to mention the foremost electricians of the
day, the immersion of the cable was successfully effected,
after which the American end of the cable of 1865
was raised, a new length spliced on, and the shore-end
safely landed in Trinity Bay. Europe and America
were thus united together by two electric bonds.

It may here be mentioned that ocean cables are
usually made in three sections, called, respectively, the
shore-end, the intermediate section and the deep-sea
section. It is clear that the submerged conductor needs
the greatest protection in the shallow water that surrounds
the coast, where it lies on a pebbly or rocky bottom,
exposed to the drifting action of currents and
tides, as well as to the haling flukes of the anchors of
storm-tossed ships. In deep water, on the other hand,
there is neither shingly bottom nor violent movement
to displace and abrade the cable; for all is quiet and
peaceful in the profound depths where the god of the
trident holds his court; and hence few coverings and
a light armor afford sufficient protection. The wear and
tear in the ocean depths is a vanishing quantity when
compared with the abrasive effects near coast-lines.
Looking at the sections of an ocean cable, the biggest
and heaviest is the shore-end, while the thinnest and
lightest is that which goes down into the depths of the
sea. The lengths of the various sections are determined
by the survey of the route, which is always carefully
made before completing the specification of the cable.
Moreover, as the position of the cable-ship at noon every
day is known from its longitude and latitude, it follows
that the location of the cable on the bed of the ocean is
also exactly known. When a cable is broken either by
an upheaval or by a subsidence of the ocean floor, the
distance of the rupture from the shore end is determined
by an electrical test, after which a repair-ship is dispatched
to the spot, when the cable is lifted, the
"fault" cut away, a new length spliced on, and the
amended cable allowed to settle down into its watery
depths.

At the present time (July, 1909), there are sixteen
cables carrying the work of the North Atlantic, at an
average speed of 20 words a minute duplex, or 40 words
a minute, counting both directions.

This cable narrative affords as striking an illustration
of the triumph of failure as any recorded in the history
of human enterprise. It was a victory of mind over
matter; of character and tactfulness, energy and endurance
over difficulties of every kind, moral and financial,
mechanical and meteorological. The four expeditions of
1857, 1858, 1865 and 1866 represent years of hard work,
anxiety and distressing failures; but, sustained by the
patience of hope and by an unshaken confidence in the
soundness of the enterprise as well as in the ability of
their staff, the Directors of the Atlantic Company were
well rewarded for the disappointment occasioned and
the monetary losses incurred. "It has been a long
struggle," said the initial promoter of the enterprise,
Mr. Cyrus W. Field, speaking at a banquet given in his
honor on November 15th, 1866, at the Metropolitan
Hotel, New York, "a long struggle of nearly thirteen
years of anxious watching and ceaseless toil. Often my
heart was ready to sink. Many times, when wandering
in the forests of Newfoundland in pelting rain, or on
the decks of ships in dark, stormy nights, I almost accused
myself of madness and folly to sacrifice the peace
of my family for what might have proved but a dream.
I have seen my companions, one after another, fall by
my side, and I feared that I, too, might not live to see
the end. And yet one hope has led me on; I prayed
that I might not taste of death till the work was accomplished.
That prayer has been answered; and now,
beyond all acknowledgments to men, is the feeling of
gratitude to Almighty God."

It was men like Field and Thomson that the poet had
in mind when he wrote:


The wise and active conquer difficulties
By daring to attempt them. Sloth and folly
Shiver and shrink at sight of toil and labor,
And make the impossibility they fear.


Shortly after his return home, Prof. Thomson was
knighted for his splendid services in connection with
sub-oceanic cables, and was also honored with the freedom
of the City of Glasgow.

If while journeying over land or sea, Sir William's
mind was always active, his eyes were also open and
observant. In the numerous voyages which he undertook
in the interest of cable companies, he seems to have
been struck by the unreliable character of the ordinary
apparatus used in taking soundings, consisting of a
heavy weight suspended by a thick hempen cord unwound
from a reel. Owing to the massiveness of the
cord, the motion of the ship and currents in the water
would necessarily deflect it from the vertical, so that the
soundings recorded would be in excess of the true depth.
To remedy this defect, Thomson replaced the rope, at
first by a steel wire, and later by a thin strand of steel
wires, on which the speed of the ship has but little
effect; the sinker descends vertically with considerable
velocity, and is raised with equal rapidity by suitable
winding-up machinery placed in the stern of the ship.
The sinker carries a gauge consisting of a quill-tube open
at the lower end and closed at the top. The inside,
which is coated with silver chromate, shows by the discoloration
produced by the action of the sea water how
far the water has compressed the air in the tube. By
comparison with a graduated ruler, the depth is then
read off. When the sinker reaches bottom, the heavy
weight is detached automatically, so that there is but
little strain on the wire as it ascends with its thermometer
and battery of tubes containing samples of the
depths reached.

A story is told in connection with this sounding-machine
which shows the vivacity and wit of the inventor.
Having brought his friend Joule into White's one day,
he pointed to a number of coils of steel wire lying on the
floor, informing his English friend of "mechanical-equivalent"
fame at the same time that he intended the
wire for sounding purposes. Upon Joule's innocently
asking what note it would sound, he received the prompt
answer, "the deep sea"!

Another subject to which Sir William gave some attention
after his experiences on the ocean is the navigating
compass. His observations led him to distrust the long,
heavy needles then in general use on shipboard. Besides
the friction to which the pressure on the pivot
gives rise and which necessarily diminishes the sensitiveness
of the needle, there was another objection, due
to the difficulty experienced in successfully applying
steel magnets and soft-iron masses to compensate for the
magnetism of the ship and for the changes induced in it
by change of place in the earth's magnetic field.

As a result, Prof. Thomson devised a compass-card
which is remarkable for its lightness and sensitiveness.
It is made of two sets of magnets, containing four
needles each, arranged symmetrically on the right and
left of the pivot. The four needles, forming a set, are
of unequal length, ranging from 3-1/4 to 2 inches, with the
shortest outermost. Such a card, with its associated correctors
of steel magnets and soft-iron balls, has added
greatly to the safety and certainty of navigation; and as
such, it is used to-day in the merchant service and in
the navies of most countries of the world.

As we have seen, Thomson had the keen, racy wit of
his race. Lecturing before the members of the Birmingham
and Midland Institute in 1883, he placed himself
and his nationality on record in a very humorous
way. His subject was "The six gateways of Knowledge."
As will be remembered by the readers of The
Pilgrim's Progress, old Bunyan likened the soul to a
citadel on a hill having no means of communication with
the outer world save by live gates, viz., the eye gate,
the ear gate, the mouth gate, the nose gate and the feel
gate. These are the five senses by which we obtain our
knowledge of the material world which surrounds us.
But Prof. Thomson took issue with Bunyan, with Reid,
and the metaphysicians of all time in maintaining in this
lecture that we have six gateways of knowledge instead
of five, justifying the position which he took by affirming
that the sense of touch is really twofold, one of heat and
the other of force. It does not appear, however, that he
made any marked impression on the philosophic thought
of the day, for psychologists continued to write with undisturbed
equanimity of the five senses and not the six.

It was on this occasion that Prof. Thomson said: "The
only census of the senses, so far as I am aware, that ever
before made them more than five was the Irishman's
reckoning of seven senses. I presume the Irishman's
seventh sense was common sense; and I believe that the
possession of that virtue by my countrymen, I speak as
an Irishman, I say the large possession of the seventh
sense which I believe Irishmen have, will do more to
alleviate the woes of Ireland than the removal of 'the
melancholy ocean' which surrounds its shores."

For the successful operation of cables, telegraph lines
and scientific investigations of all sorts, a system of practical
electrical units, accepted by all companies and
countries of the world, was soon found to be indispensable.
The pioneer in the movement for establishing an
international system of electrical standards was Mr. J.
Latimer Clark, who, assisted by his distinguished partner,
(Sir) Charles Bright, prepared a paper on "The
formation of Standards of Electrical Quantity and Resistance,"
which was read at the Manchester meeting
of the British Association in 1861. Prof. Thomson was
present; and, at his instance, a committee was appointed
to report on the general question of electrical units.
This was the first meeting of a committee that was destined
to accomplish much in the electric and electromagnetic
field; it was the initial impulse of a movement
that brought renown to the entire body of English electricians.
Such units as the ohm, the volt and the farad
met with immediate acceptance, while later on the
ampere, the coulomb, the watt and the joule were
introduced. Among the members of this body besides
Prof. Thomson, were such able men as Clerk Maxwell,
Joule, Lord Rayleigh, Sir William Siemens, Johnstone
Stoney, Balfour Stewart, and Carey Foster.

The world is then indebted to the insistence and advocacy
of Prof. Thomson for the general acceptance of
the "C.G.S." system of measurement, which involves
the centimeter (length), the gram (mass), and the
second (time) as the fundamental units from which all
others are derived.

Prof. Thomson has claims in the "wireless" field
also; for as far back as 1855, he studied the nature of
the discharge of a condenser and proved mathematically
that, under certain conditions easily realized in
practice, such discharges are of an oscillatory character,
consisting of a forward and a backward rush of electricity
between the two coatings of the condenser. As
pointed out on page 92, Prof. Henry had reached the
same conclusion in 1842, and Helmholtz in 1847; but
Thomson's insight into the phenomenon is keen and his
mathematical analysis of it very remarkable.

Just as the to-and-fro motions of the prongs of a
tuning-fork give rise to sound-waves in the air, so the
electric oscillation due to a condenser discharge sets up
in the universal ether electric waves which flash the
news of the world over continents and oceans with unthinkable
velocity.

By special request, Sir William Thomson gave, in
1884, a course of lectures at the Johns Hopkins University,
Baltimore, to an audience of "professional fellow-students
in physical science," as he called the élite of
American men of science, twenty-one in number, assembled
to hear him. These accomplished physicists he
also affectionately called his "twenty-one coefficients."

The subject was the wave-theory of light, and the
object of the lecturer was to show how far the phenomena
of light, such as its transmission, refraction and
dispersion, could be explained within the limits of the
elastic solid theory of the ether, which makes that
hypothetical medium rigid, highly elastic and non-gravitational.
From the very first lecture, Sir William
assumed a cold and diffident attitude toward the rival
theory of Clerk Maxwell, which makes light an electromagnetic
phenomenon; and though his own presented
formidable difficulties, and its rival was universally accepted,
the veteran Professor assured his hearers that
the elastic solid theory is the "only tenable foundation
for the wave-theory of light in the present (1884) state
of our knowledge."

Despite the energy which he displayed, his luminous
argumentation and close logic, Kelvin made no converts
among his "twenty-one coefficients"; and it soon
became evident that he was championing a lost cause.
Newton did the same when he held tenaciously to the
corpuscular theory of light; and in doing so, let it be
said, that he retarded the acceptance of the wave-theory
and the advance of science by a hundred years.

A few years after the Baltimore lectures, official recognition
of his distinguished services and of his eminence
in science came to Sir William Thomson when, in
1892, he was raised to the peerage, with the title of
Baron Kelvin of Netherhall, Kelvin being the name
of a stream which passes near the buildings of the
University of Glasgow and flows into the Clyde, while
Netherhall is that of his country-seat at Largs, in Ayrshire,
40 miles from Glasgow.

As to the structure of matter, Kelvin lived to see the
"atom" of his youth and mature years shattered into
fragments, and the atomic theory of matter rapidly
yielding to the electronic. Though he maintained an
open mind toward the new school of physics, he was
reserved and conservative toward the revolutionary
doctrine of extreme radio-activists. He did not believe
in the transformation of one elementary form of matter
into another; and he strenuously combated the theory
of the spontaneous disintegration of the atom.

Notwithstanding a long life devoted to the study of
mathematical and experimental physics, during which
Kelvin unraveled many a difficult problem in electricity
and magnetism and added many a beautiful skein to the
texture of our knowledge in electrostatics and electrokinetics,
that illustrious man, the acknowledged leader
in physical science, made a public admission in 1896
which caused a great stir throughout the scientific world.
It was on the occasion of the celebration of the golden
jubilee of his professorship of natural philosophy in the
University of Glasgow. Delegates had come from all
parts of the world; kings and princes had sent their
representatives; universities and learned societies of
every country of the Old World and the New vied with
one another in doing honor to the scientist who had
figured so long and so conspicuously in the advances of
the age. It was on that solemn occasion and in presence
of such a notable assembly that Kelvin made the astonishing
admission that, although he had been a diligent
student of electricity and magnetism for a period exceeding
fifty years, and although he had pondered every
day for forty years over the nature of the ether and the
constitution of matter, he knew no more about their
essence, about what they really are, than he knew at
the beginning of his professional work.

This confession, remarkable by reason of the man
who made it and the circumstances in which it was
made, has always appeared to the writer of these lines
as having more of the ring of disappointment in it than
of blank failure. Kelvin's great analytical mind early
and persistently strove to penetrate the closely guarded
secrets of nature; and because Dame Nature did not
yield to his open sesame, but persisted in her reticence,
the philosopher grew pessimistic and disappointed; and,
under the sway of such feelings, he summed up the result
of his life-quest after the ultimate problems in science
and pronounced it a "failure."

A "failure" it was not, if science is the discovery
and registration of the laws of God as revealed in the
universe of mind and matter; for few men of his generation,
if any, made more contributions of the first order
to the theory of electrostatics, to the doctrine of energy,
to hydrodynamics and the thermo-electric properties
of matter. This note of disappointment, or wail of
despondency, had been sounded before by Faraday, who
said that, the more he studied electrical phenomena,
the less he seemed to know about electricity itself.
Was not Laplace animated by a kindred feeling when
he spoke about the infinitude of our ignorance? Lastly,
was not this intense feeling of our limited powers precisely
that which, after all his discoveries in mathematics,
in optics and in celestial mechanics, made Newton
compare himself to a child standing on the beach
with the vast ocean of truth before him, unfathomed and
unexplored?

Kelvin gave a beautiful example to the world when,
after resigning the chair which he had occupied for
fifty-five years in the University of Glasgow, he immediately
proceeded to enter his name on the undergraduate
list, intimating by such an act that, whether a man
is a professor-in-ordinary of natural philosophy or a professor
emeritus, he must ever be a student, in close
touch with nature.

Lord Kelvin had the happiness of enjoying good
health throughout all the years of his long career, a
happiness due in part to nature, and in part also to the
simplicity, frugality and regularity of his life.

As already said, he was fond of cruising in European
waters in his yacht Lalla Rookh during the summer
months, and even venturing out on the Atlantic as far
as Madeira, for,


He loved the sea, and what is more,
He loved it best when far from shore.


In later years, however, owing to facial neuralgia, he
was accustomed to spend a month or so every summer
with Lady Kelvin at Aix-les-Bains, from which visits
he always derived much benefit.

While making some experiments in a corridor of his
beautiful home at Netherhall, he caught a chill on
November 23d, 1907, from which he never rallied, despite
the cares and attentions that were fondly lavished
upon him. The bulletins that were issued concerning
his condition were read all the world over with more
concern than if they referred to a reigning sovereign
or an heir apparent. Every teacher of physics, mathematical
or experimental; every man interested in the
advance of science and the spread of knowledge,
anxiously awaited news from the sick-room of the illustrious
patient       news that was transmitted to the ends
of the earth by the siphon-recorder invented by the
dying scientist in the heyday of his life; and when the
word came that Kelvin had breathed his last, that
cablegram brought universal sorrow for the quenching
of the brightest light of the age and the loss of the
leading scientist, the model man and faithful Christian.

It was in the fitness of things that the man who was
considered the greatest since Newton should be buried
in Westminster Abbey, and that the mortal remains
of Lord Kelvin should find a resting-place next to the
grave of the genius who thought out the Principia and
discovered the gravitational law which governs the
planetary as well as the stellar universe.

If asked to say what impressed me most in Lord
Kelvin, I would mention the cordial manner in which he
welcomed those who sought advice; the encouragement
which he held out to students; his absolute devotion to
truth; his fair-mindedness and candor; his reverence in
dealing with the problems of the soul and the destiny of
man; and the uniform, tranquil happiness of his life,
due, under God, to his profound religious belief and
noble Christian life.

A man of strong convictions, Kelvin did not, however,
wear his religion on his sleeve, but treasured it
in the depths of his heart, where it was never disturbed
by the tossing and ever-changing wave-forms of
individual opinion. He quietly but uniformly maintained
that physical science demands the existence and action
of creative power; and he did not shrink from affirming
this conviction whenever circumstances seemed to require
it, as was the case on the memorable occasion of
his Presidential address to the members of the British
Association in 1871. In concluding that brilliant discourse,
he said: "But strong, overpowering proofs of
intelligent and benevolent design lie all around us; and
if ever perplexities, whether metaphysical or scientific,
turn us away from them for a time, they come back
upon us with irresistible force, showing to us, through
nature, the influence of free will, and teaching us that
all living beings depend on one ever-acting Creator and
Ruler."

Once when particularly disgusted with the materialistic
views of those who, while denying the existence of
a Creator, attributed the wonders of nature, animate
and inanimate, to the potency of a fortuitous concourse
of atoms, he wrote to Liebig, asking him if a leaf or a
flower could be formed or even made grow by chemical
forces, to which he received the significant reply from
the famous chemist of Giessen: "I would more readily
believe that a book on chemistry or on botany could
grow out of dead matter by chemical processes."

We have already referred to the custom which obtained
in the University of Glasgow, of beginning the
daily sessions by invoking the blessing of heaven on the
work about to be undertaken. Having liberty in the
matter of choice, Prof. Thomson selected for this purpose
a prayer from the morning service of the Church
of England, which reads: "O Lord, our heavenly Father,
almighty and everlasting God, who hast safely
brought us to the beginning of this day; defend us in
the same with Thy mighty power; and grant that this
day we fall into no sin, neither run into any kind of
danger; but that all our doings may be ordered by Thy
governance, to do always what is righteous in Thy
sight; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen."

Academical honors were showered upon Lord Kelvin
by seats of learning, ancient and modern; he was a D.
C. L. Oxford, LL. D. Cambridge, and a D. Sc. London;
he was President of the Royal Society from 1890 to
1895; President of the British Association in 1871;
Knight of the Prussian Order Pour le Mérite, and Foreign
Associate of the Institut de France.

His published works include a "Treatise on Natural
Philosophy," 2 vols., written in collaboration with Prof.
Tait, of Edinburgh (the two authors were often referred
to as T and T'); "Contributions to Electrostatics and
Magnetism"; "Collected mathematical and physical Papers,"
3 vols.; "Popular Lectures and Addresses,"
3 vols.; and the "Baltimore Lectures." These, as well
as the instruments which he devised for navigation,
for the finest work of the laboratory, as well as for the
commercial measurement of current, potential, and energy,
form a monument to Lord Kelvin that will be
aere perennius.

FORDHAM UNIVERSITY PRESS SERIES

MAKERS OF MODERN MEDICINE       A series Of Biographies
of the men to whom we owe the important advances in the
development of modern medicine. By James J. Walsh, M. D.,
Ph. D., LL.D., Dean and Professor of the History of Medicine at
Fordham University School of Medicine, N. Y. Second Edition,
1909. 362 pp. Price, $2.00 net.

The London Lancet said: "The list is well chosen, and we have to
express gratitude for so convenient and agreeable a collection of
biographies, for which we might otherwise have to search through
many scattered books. The sketches are pleasantly written, interesting,
and well adapted to convey the thoughtful members of our
profession just the amount of historical knowledge that they would
wish to obtain. We hope that the book will find many readers."

The New York Times: "The book is intended primarily for students
of medicine, but laymen will find it not a little interesting."

Il Morgagni (Italy): "Professor Walsh narrates important lives in
modern medicine with an easy style that makes his book delightful
reading. It certainly will give the young physician an excellent idea
of who made our modern medicine."

The Lamp: "This exceptionally interesting book is from the practiced
hand of Dr. James J. Walsh. It is a suggestive thought that
each of the great specialists portrayed were god-fearing men, men
of faith, far removed from the shallow materialism that frequently
flaunts itself as inherently worthy of extra consideration for its own
sake."

The Church Standard (Protestant Episcopal): "There is perhaps
no profession in which the lives of its leaders would make more
fascinating reading than that of medicine, and Dr. Walsh by his
clever style and sympathetic treatment by no means mars the interest
which we might thus expect."

The New York Medical Journal: "We welcome works of this
kind; they are evidence of the growth of culture within the medical
profession, which betokens that the time has come when our teachers
have the leisure to look backward to what has been accomplished."

Science: "The sketches are extremely entertaining and useful.
Perhaps the most striking thing is that everyone of the men described
was of the Catholic faith, and the dominant idea is that great
scientific work is not incompatible with devout adherence to the tenets
of the Catholic religion."


THE POPES AND SCIENCE       The story Of the Papal Relations
to Science from the Middle Ages down to the Nineteenth
Century. By James J. Walsh, M. D., Ph. D., LL.D. 440 pp.
Price, $2.00 net.

Prof. Pagel, Professor of History at the University of Berlin:
"This book represents the most serious contribution to the history
of medicine that has ever come out of America."

Sir Clifford Allbutt, Regius Professor of Physic at the University
of Cambridge (England): "The book as a whole is a fair
as well as a scholarly argument."

The Evening Post (New York) says: "However strong the reader's
prejudice * * * * he cannot lay down Prof. Walsh's volume without
at least conceding that the author has driven his pen hard and deep
into the 'academic superstition' about Papal Opposition to science."
In a previous issue it had said: "We venture to prophesy that all
who swear by Dr. Andrew D. White's History of the Warfare of
Science With Theology in Christendom will find their hands full,
if they attempt to answer Dr. James J. Walsh's The Popes and
Science."

The Literary Digest said: "The book is well worth reading for
its extensive learning and the vigor of its style."

The Southern Messenger says: "Books like this make it clear
that it is ignorance alone that makes people, even supposedly educated
people, still cling to the old calumnies."

The Nation (New York) says: "The learned Fordham Physician
has at command an enormous mass of facts, and he orders them
with logic, force and literary ease. Prof. Walsh convicts his opponents
of hasty generalizing if not anti-clerical zeal."

The Pittsburg Post says: "With the fair attitude of mind and influenced
only by the student's desire to procure knowledge, this book
becomes at once something to fascinate. On every page authoritative
facts confute the stereotyped statement of the purely theological
publications."

Prof. Welch, of Johns Hopkins, quoting Martial, said: "It is
pleasant indeed to drink at the living fountain-heads of knowledge
after previously having had only the stagnant pools of second-hand
authority."

Prof. Piersol, Professor of Anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania,
said: "I have been reading the book with the keenest
interest, for it indeed presents many subjects in what to me at least
is a new light. Every man of science looks to the beacon       truth       as
his guiding mark, and every opportunity to replace even time-honored
misconceptions by what is really the truth must be welcomed."

The Independent (New York) said: "Dr. Walsh's books should
be read in connection with attacks upon the Popes in the matter of
science by those who want to get both sides."

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
