EDITOR'S PORTFOLIO.


A happy New year to all friends and subscribers, old and young! They are
sending us such an amount of encouragement, notwithstanding the hard
times, that, instead of growing older the coming year, we think we shall
grow younger. So do not fear, little ones, that we shall talk too
learnedly for you yet awhile.

See the capital articles by the author of "Dick and I" in this number.
They are written in words of one syllable, and are as witty as they are
wise and good. Read them, and then hear your little ones read them.

We need not commend to lovers of art the fine original drawings in this
number. That of "Christmas at the North," by Merrill, and that of
"Christmas at the South." by Sheppard, of Richmond, are excellent. The
drawing of the two dogs by Harrison Weir is also capital.

The little boys in all parts of the country, who have been asking us so
urgently to give a picture of a train of cars, will be glad to learn
that Mr. Merrill has drawn a capital one which will appear in our next
number.

There is a great rush for The Nursery Primer. We can hardly get the
books from the binder fast enough to supply the demand. It is no wonder;
for no cheaper or better present for a child can be found.

The Easy Book and the The Beautiful Book are also in great demand for
holiday Gifts.

Unaccepted articles will be returned to the writers if stamps are sent
with them to pay return postage. Manuscripts not so accompanied will
not be preserved, and subsequent requests for their return cannot be
complied with.



&#9758;We want a special agent in every town in
the United States. Persons disposed to act in that capacity, are invited
to communicate with the publisher.

CHRISTMAS AT THE NORTH.
[Pg 2]



CHRISTMAS AT THE NORTH.



Hark! the bells are sounding;
Christmas draweth nigh;
Now let joy abounding
Bid all trouble fly.
Ye who pine in sorrow,
Come, be cheered to-day;
Of our gladness borrow,
As you freely may.

First give your attention
To our Christmas-tree;
But pray do not mention
All the things you see:
These are for surprises
To the children dear,&mdash;
To the Anns, Elizas,
Johnnys, Charleys here.

Are you hale and hearty,
And still young enough?
Come, then, join our party,
And play blind man's buff.
But if with the coasters
You would rather be,
See them there, the boasters!
Join them: you are free.

Hark! the sleigh-bells tinkle:
Do you wish a ride?
Will it smooth a wrinkle
Just to have a slide?
See, the road invites you;
See, the ponds entice:
Take, then, what delights you:
Whether snow or ice.

If the path to glory
Best your mood befits,
If you'd live in story,
And can brave hard hits,
See, where heroes yonder
Storm the fort with balls;
Do not stop to ponder:
Go where glory calls!

Or, perhaps, the skaters
Now attract you most:
We are patient waiters&mdash;
Will you skate, or coast?
Do not fear a tumble;
See poor Tommy there!
Up, without a grumble,
He will never care.

Welcome to our pleasures
And our Christmas cheer!
We'll not stint the measures:
Would you all were here!
Boys and girls together,&mdash;
From all parts and climes,
To enjoy this weather,
And these Christmas times!

Alfred Selwyn.

POMPEY GUARDING BABY.


My real name is Pompey; but Mr. John sometimes calls me Pompous. What he
means by that I do not know. Perhaps it is a joke. Mr. John is the
eldest brother of Dot, the baby.

I am put here to keep watch over Dot. That is a picture of me as I
appear seated on a chair by the side of the cradle where Dot is
sleeping.

I am very fond of babies. One reason of it, I think, is, that they
cannot hurt me with their little hands. They pull my ears, but not so
hard as to give me pain.

Once, on a hot day, when my mouth was open, and my tongue was out, Dot
took hold of my tongue, and pulled it as hard as he could. I did not
even say Bow-wow. I let him pull away.

I would have all people know that this baby is not to be[Pg 4] touched while
I am here. If you come near to disturb baby, I shall bark; but, if you
try to touch him, I shall bite. So be careful. You must not even touch
baby's rattle that lies on the floor.

I hear my mistress tell people what a good dog I am, and how she can
trust me to take care of baby. Yes, I am proud to say I do my duty. I
hold my head up, and keep my eyes wide open. That drawing of me is from
a photograph, and is a very good likeness. As I can't write, I have got
Master John to write this down for me.


Master John.





THE PARROT FEEDING ITS YOUNG.


The parrot is a curious bird. Here is a picture of one feeding its
young. It has a large hooked beak, and climbs trees by the aid of its
beak and feet.

The plumage of parrots varies in color. I have seen it of a bright
green, also, red and gray. These birds were well known to the ancient
Greeks and Romans, who got them mostly from India and Africa.

The parrot, as every child knows, can be taught to talk. This power it
shares with some other birds whose tongues are thick, round, and almost
the same in form as that of the parrot. Starlings, blackbirds, jays,
jackdaws, and ravens can imitate the human voice.

The parrot imitates all the noises it hears&mdash;the mewing of cats, the
barking of dogs, and the cries of birds&mdash;as easily as it imitates
speech. The parrots brought from Africa seem to prefer imitating the
voices of children, and, on that account, more easily receive their
education from them.[Pg 5]





But the gray parrot imitates the grave tones of older persons. A parrot
from Guinea, taught on the voyage by an old sailor, had caught up his
hoarse voice and cough perfectly. Afterwards, owned and taught by a
young girl, it did not forget the lessons of its first master. It was
amusing to hear this bird pass from a soft, girlish voice to his hoarse
and sailor-like tone.

Not only has the parrot the power of imitating the human voice, but it
seems to wish to do so. This is shown by its attention in listening, and
by the efforts it makes to repeat every word. It will often repeat words
or sounds that no one has taken the trouble to teach it.[Pg 6]

A parrot which had grown old with its master, and shared with him the
pains of old age, being used to hear but little more than the words, "I
am very ill," when asked, "What is the matter, Polly?" answered in a
dismal tone, and stretching itself, "I am very ill."

The language of the parrot is not wanting in ideas. When you ask one if
it has breakfasted, it knows well how to answer you, if it has satisfied
its hunger. It will not tell you that it has breakfasted when this is
not the case: at least, you cannot force it to say "No" when it ought to
say "Yes."

I have heard of a parrot, which, when pleased, would laugh most
heartily, and then cry out, "Don't make me laugh so! I shall die, I
shall die." The bird would also mimic sobbing, and exclaim, "So bad, so
bad! got such a cold!" If any one happened to cough, the parrot would
remark, "What a bad cold!"

LITTLE RUTH'S PRAYER.



Stormy and chilly had been the day;
Drifts of snow on the sidewalk lay:
All who were out in the wintry street
Went shivering on with rapid feet;
And some were poor, and thinly clad,
And wished that a good warm home they had.

But, gloomy without, it was bright within,
In the house where our little Ruth had been:
By the nursery fireside's cheerful blaze
Merry had been her thoughts and plays;
She had dressed her dolls for a fancy ball,
And read her story-books one and all.[Pg 8]

But when, at the close of the happy day,
She knelt, her one little prayer to say,
She thought of the hungry, perishing poor,
Of the children who cold and sorrow endure,
And, laying her head on her mother's knee,
Said, "Give them, O Father, all you give me!"
Dora Burnside.



ARTHUR'S MISHAP.


I am a little boy, three years old, named Arthur; and I want to tell you
what happened to me last summer.

I went down to the seashore to visit my grandmamma, alone, without
mamma, or Mary, my nurse. Grandpapa took me in the cars, and I staid
almost a week. I had a good time; for they have horses and cows and pigs
and chickens, and a swing.

One day, Aunt Anna and I went to the duck-pond. I had a rod and line,
and made believe fish. Aunt Anna turned away for a minute, and, when she
looked around, all she could see of me was my hat, floating on the
water. I had tumbled in, and was way down at the bottom of the pond.

But I soon rose to the top; and Aunt Anna reached over, and pulled me
out, and ran up to the house with me in her arms. I did not cry at all,
but coughed and sputtered a little, and told her I didn't like that old
duck-pond.

Grandmamma took off all my wet clothes, and wrapped me in a blanket, and
sang me to sleep. When I waked up, I felt all right. I got a good drink
of water when I was in the pond; but I don't mean to go very near the
edge next time.

PUSSY GETS A WARNING.


"Pussy, now that you are here, I wish to say a few words to you; and it
will be for your peace of mind to give heed to them at once. I have seen
you several times, of late, looking sharply at that little wren's nest
in the pear-tree."

"Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!"

"Yes, I know what you mean by that; but you need not plead innocence.
You think, that, as soon as those eggs are hatched, you'll have a good
feast on the little birds."

"Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!"

"Oh, you needn't deny it. Now, old cat, take my advice, and, if you
don't want to come to grief, shun temptation in season. If I find you
harming those birds, do you know what will happen?"

"Mee-ow, mee-ow, mee-ow!"

"Oh, you don't, eh? Well, I'll leave it to you to guess what will
happen. I'll only say this: there will be a noise at the river-side one
of these fine mornings, and a certain cat may get a ducking."

"Mee-ow, mee-ow! Fitt! Fitt!"

"You object to that, do you? Then, pussy, don't let me find you meddling
with the little birds or watching their nests."


Frank.

"PROUD AS A PEACOCK."

A DIALOGUE.





Laura.&mdash;Why is it, Rachel, that you wear that old winter dress to
church, this fine spring morning? Look at me.

Rachel.&mdash;What a pretty silk! And what a becoming hat and plume!

Laura.&mdash;I gave my mother no peace till she got them for me. Why don't
you make your father buy you a new spring dress, Rachel?

Rachel.&mdash;He would have given me such a dress, if I had not told him I
should like something else better.

Laura.&mdash;Indeed! Pray, what else would you like better than a beautiful
spring dress?

Rachel.&mdash;I knew that if my father gave me a silk dress this spring, he
could not afford to let me take music-lessons: so I told him I would
rather study music than have a new dress.

Laura.&mdash;What a silly girl, to prefer music-lessons to a nice new
dress![Pg 11]

Rachel.&mdash;Hark! What is that harsh noise?

Laura.&mdash;It is the cry of that foolish peacock from the balcony of the
garden yonder. He wants us to admire him.

Rachel.&mdash;How he struts about, and arches his neck, and shows his fine
feathers, bright with all the colors of the rainbow!

Laura.&mdash;I would not change my canary-bird for him.

Rachel.&mdash;And I would not change my music for your new silk dress,
Laura.

Laura.&mdash;Why do you say that? But, first, who is that man standing
there by the garden-gate?

Rachel.&mdash;That is Mr. Blunt, the clergyman who is to preach for us
to-day.

Laura.&mdash;He looks at me, and now he looks at the peacock, and now at me
again, and now, with a smile, at the peacock, and now&mdash;O Rachel! this is
too bad. I know what he is thinking of.

Rachel.&mdash;Let us hurry on to church. The bell has begun to toll.

Laura.&mdash;Ah, Rachel, he says to me, as plainly as looks can say, that I
am as vain as yonder peacock.

Rachel.&mdash;Why, Laura, how you blush! Do you think you deserve such a
reproof?

Laura.&mdash;I do, I do. Here, this Sunday morning, I have been thinking
more of my new summer silk than of any thing else. Like that screeching
peacock, I have been vain of my fine feathers. Yes, let us hurry on to
church. One sermon I have had already. It was all given in a look.

Rachel.&mdash;You are quick to take a hint, I see.

Laura.&mdash;I hope I may be as quick to profit by it. "Pride shall have a
fall," says the proverb; and my pride has fallen.

Rachel.&mdash;I shall not try to help it up, my dear.


Anna Livingston.

GRANDMOTHER'S STORY.


One summer afternoon, when grandmother was sitting in her old arm-chair,
just outside of the door, little Jane looked fondly up in her face, and
said,&mdash;

"Tell us a story, grandma."

"A story, child!" said grandma. "Why, I never made up a story in my
life."

"But you can tell a true story," said Ruth, who was seated on the
doorstep,&mdash;"about something that happened when you were a little girl."

While they were talking, George and Charles and Snap, the dog, had come
running up to join the group. Grandma stopped in her knitting, thought a
moment, and said,&mdash;

"Well, children, sit down, all of you, and I will tell you a true
story."

So the children all took seats; and grandma began:&mdash;

When I was a little girl, about the age of Ruth, my father was
preceptor of the Hingham Academy. You have all been in Hingham. It
is only fifteen miles from Boston. We go there now, by rail or by
steamboat, in less than an hour; but, in those days, we used to go
by a sailing-packet; and it was sometimes a whole day's journey.

Well, in our family there was a French boy, named Bernard Trainier.
His mother was not living. His father lived in Toulon, France. At
that time, France, under the great Napoleon, was continually at war,
and all her young men were forced into the army. I suppose it was to
save Bernard from this fate, that he was sent to America. Mr.
Trainier was acquainted with a French gentleman, Mr. Duprez, who
then lived in Boston; and, through him, Bernard was placed in my
father's care to be educated.

Well, he was a bright, pleasant boy. He soon learned to speak
English; and I and my sisters and brothers became very fond of him.
He would have been very happy, but for one thing. He longed to see
his little brother John, whom he had parted with at Toulon.

One day, to his great delight, Bernard received a letter from his
father,[Pg 13] telling him that John was also to be sent to America, and
that he would take passage from Marseilles by the first vessel bound
for Boston.





At that time there were no steamships and no regular packets from
Europe. The only way of coming was by a merchant-vessel. So Bernard,
who was looking and longing for the arrival of his brother, did not
think it strange when six weeks passed away without bringing him.
But when two months passed, and he did not appear, poor Bernard
began to be anxious. Four months, five months, six months, passed.
Nothing was heard of John. Not a word came from Mr. Trainier. More
than a year passed away, and still there was no news. Bernard was in
despair.

One August day (it must have been, I think, in the year 1805), when
my father had occasion to visit Boston, he took Bernard with him;
and, while there, went with him to call on Mr. Duprez, from whom
they hoped to hear some good news.

But there was no comfort for poor Bernard in what Mr. Duprez had to
tell. He had learned from friends in Toulon that Mr. Trainier, soon
after sending his youngest son to America, had gone to St. Domingo
to look after some estates. St. Domingo was then in a state of
insurrection. The slaves had risen against their masters. When last
heard from, Mr. Trainier had been taken prisoner, and it was feared
that he had been[Pg 14] put to death. As to John Trainier, all that could
be learned was that he had been put on board a vessel bound from
Marseilles to Boston, but the name of the vessel or what had become
of her nobody knew.

You may imagine the distress of Bernard at hearing this, and how sad
my father was when he took the poor boy's hand to return with him to
Hingham. The packet station was at the head of Long Wharf. They
reached it long before the vessel was ready to sail: so, to pass
away the time, they walked slowly down the wharf,&mdash;my father still
holding Bernard by the hand. They stopped a few minutes at the end
of the wharf, then walked back again.

They had got about half way up the wharf when they heard a shout
behind them. They looked around. The voice seemed to come from the
water side. As they looked, a boy about eleven years old, dressed in
rough sailor-clothes, jumped ashore from a brig at the wharf, and
came running towards them, calling, "Bernard! Bernard!" again and
again.

Bernard stood a moment as if amazed; then, suddenly letting go of my
father's hand, he gave a cry of joy, sprang forward and caught the
little sailor in his arms. It was his brother John.

Here grandma stopped. There was silence a few minutes. Then the
questions began to come thick and fast. "Where had John been all this
time?" "And why didn't he get to Boston before?"

"Well," said grandma, "I must tell that in a few words; for my story is
getting long."

The captain of the brig had promised Mr. Trainier that he would see
the little boy safely landed at the house of Mr. Duprez in Boston.
But the captain was a bad man. Instead of treating John as a
passenger, he forced him to do duty as a cabin-boy.

Then, instead of going to Boston, the brig went to New York, and
from there on a long voyage to some foreign port. At last she had
come to Boston; but the captain had no idea of letting John go even
then. He meant to carry him away again, and would have done so but
for the accidental meeting of the two brothers on Long Wharf.

"The captain had to let him go after that, didn't he, grandma?" said
little Jane.[Pg 15]

"Of course he did," said grandma. "My father soon settled that point. He
took John on board the packet, and brought him to Hingham. I well
remember the time when the brothers came home, and how John told the
story of his hardships, and how we all cried when we heard it, and then
laughed with joy to see Bernard so happy."

"And was not John happy too?" asked Ruth.

"Yes, indeed," said grandma. "And yet both the boys were sad when they
thought of their father's fate, and felt that they were orphans with no
means of support. We all did our best to cheer them up, and my father
told them they should have a home with us till they were old enough to
take care of themselves."

"And what became of them? Are they living now? Tell us all about them,"
said the children.

"Ah! I must save that for another story. This is enough for to-day."

CHRISTMAS AT THE SOUTH.


Christmas at the South is usually a much milder day than it is at the
North. The ponds are not often frozen, and there is little or no snow on
the ground: so there is no skating, or coasting, or throwing of
snow-balls, or merry jingle of sleigh-bells.

But we have very good times at the South notwithstanding. The boys go
out with their guns, and sometimes shoot a wild turkey; but often they
shoot just for the sake of making a noise. Their traps are set, too,
about this time, for squirrels, as you may see in the picture.

Games of foot-ball and base-ball are not uncommon; and I have known it
mild enough for girls and boys to play croquet on the lawn, or to row in
a boat on the river.

What is that little girl doing in the central part of the picture? She
is making a present of a sack to her good old nurse, who now has a baby
of her own. The sack is for the baby. How glad they all are&mdash;the mother,
the aunt, and the little boy, who, I think, must be the baby's brother!

As for the Christmas feast at the South, it may be very much like that
at the North. In the picture we get a glimpse of a roast pig and a plum
pudding. There is often a wild turkey and a plenty of other game.

"But is there a Christmas-tree? And does Santa Claus come with his
trinkets, and his picture-books, as at the North?" Yes, in many families
there is a Christmas tree, and Santa Claus does not forget that there
are little children at the South also.

In the evening, the little ones play blind-man's-bluff, or
hunt-the-slipper. Sometimes Jack Frost steals down from the North, and
pinches them. But he does not stay long. He likes his northern home
best.

THE CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.


Mr. D. had promised to give his wife a beautiful rattan rocking-chair as
a Christmas present. It was his employment to sell these articles. In
due time, Mrs. D. called at his place of business, and selected a chair;
but, as she sat enjoying it for a few minutes, a new idea came into her
mind, and she told her husband that she would gladly do without her
present, if he would give Jennie and Alice (their two little daughters)
each a chair.

Her husband agreed to this; and on Christmas Eve he took home with him
two elegant little rocking-chairs. Leaving them in his garden, he went
in to tea, and, after taking his seat at the table, said to his
children, "I have a story to tell you, and it is a true story. Would you
like to hear it?"

Of course they were all eager to do so. So he said, "There was a lady in
my store to-day, whose husband had promised to make her a Christmas
present of a rocking-chair. After she had selected a very nice one, she
turned to her husband, and said, 'If you will give each of our children
a chair, I will forego the pleasure of having mine.' Now, wasn't she
truly kind?"

The children were much interested in the story; and both exclaimed,
"Yes, sir!" Then he added, "I liked the lady very much."

Here, little Alice, growing slightly jealous, exclaimed, "Did you like
her better than you do mamma?"

"Oh, no! not better, but full as well," answered her father.

After supper, the chairs were brought in, much to the surprise and
delight of Jennie and Alice, who both joyfully exclaimed, "O papa! you
meant us!"

THE PROPER TIME.



"Will you play with me? Will you play with me?"
A little girl said to the birds on a tree.
"Oh, we have our nests to build," said they:
"There's a time for work, and a time for play."

Then, meeting a dog, she cried, "Halloo!
Come play with me, Jip, and do as I do."
Said he, "I must watch the orchard to-day:
There's a time for work, and a time for play."

A boy she saw; and to him she cried,
"Come, play with me, John, by the greenwood side."
"Oh, no!" said John, "I've my lesson to say:
There's a time for work, and a time for play."[Pg 20]

Then thoughtful a while stood the little miss,
And said, "It is hard, on a day like this,
To go to work; but, from what they all say,
'Tis a time for work, and not for play."

So homeward she went, and took her book,
And first at the pictures began to look;
Then said, "I think I will study to-day:
There's a time for work, and a time for play."

OUR DOG MILO.


Milo was the name of a fine Spanish pointer. He had such an expressive
face, such delicate ears, and such wise eyes, that you could not help
looking at him.

And then he could stand up so cleverly on his hind-legs, dressed in his
little red coat and cap! An old beggar-woman, whose eyesight was not
very good, once took him for a boy, and thanked the "little man," as she
called him, for a present which we boys had trained him to go through
the form of offering.

He had belonged to a travelling company of jugglers and rope-dancers, by
whom he had been taught various tricks, though he had been made to
undergo much hard treatment. He could fire off a pistol, stand on guard
as a sentinel, beat a drum, and serve as a horse for the monkeys of the
show.

This last piece of work poor Milo did not at all like. The monkeys would
scratch and plague him; and, if he resented it, he would be whipped. His
worst enemy was a little monkey named Jocko, who delighted to torment
him.[Pg 21]





At last, we boys talked so much to our good papa about Milo, that he
bought him of the jugglers. How happy we were when we got possession of
him! Poor Milo seemed to be aware of our kind act. After that, it seemed
as if he could not do too much to show his gratitude.

How patiently he would stand on his legs, or march with us in our mimic
ranks as a soldier, when we went forth to battle! In all our plays we
could not do without Milo. He would stand on guard beside our camp; and
he it was who always had to fire the pistol when a deserter was to be
shot.

Sometimes we would play going through the woods, where the Indians were
likely to waylay us. Then Milo was our pathfinder. With his nice sense
of smell he must find out where the cunning redskins were lying in wait.

There was no end to the uses to which we put the dear little dog in our
plays. Never did he snarl, or lose his temper. He saw that we loved him;
and he repaid our love by taking all the pains he could to please us.

But a dark time came for Milo and for us. A fright about mad dogs broke
out in our town. A bad fellow said[Pg 22] he had seen another dog, who was
known to be mad, bite Milo. This was untrue; for Milo was at home at the
time.

But all our prayers were of no use. We must bring Milo to the town-hall
to have him shot. How we children wept and took on! Poor Milo, our dear
little playmate! Must we lose him forever? We could not bear the
thought.

The little dog himself saw that something was the matter, and whined at
seeing us all so sad. All at once up started our eldest brother, Robert,
and declared it should not be. He would rescue the little dog.





He did so without letting any one know of his plan. He took Milo, at
night, in the cars, to the nearest great city. Here one of our cousins
lived. Placing Milo in his charge, Robert came back; and when the
town-officer came after the little dog, to kill him, he was told that
Milo had stepped out, and, if the town-folks wanted him, they must find
him.

In a few months, the outcry about mad dogs was hushed; and then we had
Milo home again. What rejoicing there was! And how glad was Milo himself
to get back, and greet all his little friends with barks and leaps!

THE THREE CALVES.


My little friend Max was on a
farm, a whole week last May, and he likes to talk of the good time he
had there.

He says there were no less[Pg 24] than three calves in the great field; and he
used to watch them and feed them two or three times a day.

They grew to be so tame that they would let him come up and pat them on
the back, and feel of their budding horns. He gave them each a name.

One he called Daisy; one, Pink; and one, Rose. He said if he had been
with them three weeks, he should have taught them to know their names.

He hopes to see them again next May; but I think they will be good sized
cows by that time, for they grow very fast.

"WHY?"


"You must not go in there!" said an old dog to a young pup who stood on
the white steps of a large house. "You must stay out now."

"Why?" asked the young pup. For it was a trick (and[Pg 26] a bad trick) of his
to say, "Why?" when he was told to do, or not to do, a thing.

"Why?" said the old dog: "I cannot say why. Old as I am, I do not know
why. But I do know, that, if you go in when it is a wet day like this,
the maid will drive you out."

"But why?" went on the pup. "It is not fair. There is no sense in it. I
have been in the house some days, and no one turned me out; so why
should they now?"

"Those were fine, sunny days," said the old dog.

"Well, it is on the wet days that I most want to be in the house," said
the pup. "And I don't see why I should stay out. So here I go."

And so he did; but he soon found, that, though no one stopped to tell
him "why" he must not come in, it was quite true that he might not. The
first who saw him was the cook, who had a broom in her hand.

"That vile pup!" cried she. "Look at his feet!"

"What is wrong with my feet?" barked the pup.

But she did not wait to tell him. She struck him with the broom; and he
fled with a howl up the stairs.

"Oh, that pup!" cried the maid, as she saw the marks of his feet. "He
ought not to come into the house at all, if he will not keep out on wet
days."

"But why?" yelped the pup, as the maid threw a hearth-brush at his head.

Still no one told him why. But a man just then came up stairs. "Why,
what a mess!" he said. "Oh, I see! It is that pup. I thought he knew he
must not come in!"

"So I did; but I did not know why," growled the pup, as, with sore
back and lame foot, he crept under a chair.

"Come out, come out!" cried the man. "I will not have you in the house
at all. Out with you!" And he seized him with a strong hand, and chained
him in a stall.[Pg 27]

"You might have stopped out, and played on the grass, if you had staid
there," the man said. "But, as you will come into the house when you
ought not to, you must be kept where you cannot do so."

And so the young pup had to stay in the dull stall. And when, at last,
he was let out, he did not ask, "Why?" if he was told to do, or not to
do, a thing, but did as he ought at once, like a wise dog.

THE OLD YEAR AND THE NEW.


"Good-by, Old Year!" "Good by, good-by!" he replies, as he goes out into
the cold and snow. "Be good children!" "Who comes? who comes?" "This is
I, the glad New Year!" "What have you brought?" "A plenty of good
wishes. Oh! you must all be good children!"[Pg 28]




A MORNING CALL.



Baby Nan has company,
Baby Nell has come a-calling
In her carriage riding gay:
Nan sits on a great soft shawl
With two pillows, lest she fall.
Nan, here's little Nell come calling!
Haven't you a word to say?
"Gar goo, ghee! gar ghee, argoo!"
Nell, she's saying, "How d'ye do?"

Pillows bring for baby Nell;
On the soft shawl seat her grandly,
With her mouth set rose-bud way,
And her grave blue eyes surveying
This strange room she's so astray in.
Nell, dear Nell, don't cry! see Nannie!
Haven't you a word to say?
"Ar-goo, dah, dah! dah dah, goo!"
"I am pretty well, are you?"

Baby Nan has not a fear;
Up and down her small fists flying,
Bright eyes dancing, laughing gay!
Nell, she's showing you her socks;
Now she shakes her rattlebox;[Pg 29]
Hands and feet she keeps a-flying;
She has something more to say:
"Bab, bab, bab! kee-ee, bab, er!"
I cannot interpret her.





Baby Nell can. See her laugh!
Forth her dimpled hand she stretches.
Pass your rattle, Nan, that way;
She, you see, can shake it too.
Now look out, she's seizing you;
Eagerly your toes she reaches!
Both the baby voices say,
"Goo, goo, bab, bab! argoo ghee!"
They're great friends so soon, you see.[Pg 30]

They have secrets, Nell and Nan,
Laugh and coo, and crow together;
Nan wants Nell to stop all day
Playing with her on the shawl.
Must she go? How short the call!
Come again this sunny weather.
Hear the little darling say,
"Argoo, kee ee! gar goo, gay!"
Shake your hand, Nan, too, "Day-day!"



Mary L. Bolles Branch.





"HE DID IT FIRST."


There were once two sheep who lived in a field. One was black, and one
was white. In the same field lived a horse and a cow. Now, the black
sheep was not at all good. But, where he chose to go, the white sheep
would go; and, what he did the white sheep would do.

So they both did what they ought not. And when the white sheep was asked
why he did what he ought not, he would say, "The black sheep did it
first!" One day, a boy went through the field, and did not shut the
gate. The black sheep saw it, and ran out of the field with great glee.
The white sheep saw it too, and they both went some way.

But soon they met a large dog, who knew that they ought not to be out in
the road. He ran at them, and bit them, and tore some wool off their
backs. They were glad to run back to the field; and the white sheep was
quite ill with fright all the rest of the day.

"But why did you go?" said the old cow. "The black sheep went," said the
white one. "He did it first."[Pg 31]

Well, the gate was shut; but one day the black sheep found a way out of
the field through a hole in the fence. He crept through the gap; and, of
course, the white sheep crept through as well. They got out on the moor,
and thought it fine fun to be there, with no one in sight.

Soon the black sheep, who was first, came to the edge of a deep pit. He
gave a great jump, and leaped in.

The white sheep did not stop to think. He gave a great jump, and leaped
in too. Down, down, down he fell, on to a heap of great sharp stones.
Both he and the black sheep were much hurt. They could not get out, and
were forced to lie there in great pain. By and by some men came by, and
saw the sheep in the pit. The men got them out, and took them back to
the field, and sent for some one to see what could be done for them.

The horse and the cow, in great grief, came and stood by the side of the
white sheep as he lay on the grass. They were fond of him in spite of
all his faults. "Oh, why!" cried the cow, with tears in her eyes (and
the bell that was hung round her neck shook and rang as she leaned over
him),&mdash;"why did you leave the field with the black sheep?"

"He did it first," said the white one in a faint voice.

"Then why did you jump down that steep place? Could you not see that it
was a pit?"

"I did not stop to see. He did it first," said the white sheep. Then,
with a groan, he went on to ask, "How is the black sheep? Is he here
too? And what does the man think who comes to see us?"

"I grieve to say," said the cow, "that he thought you were both far too
much hurt to live. The poor black sheep has just died, and I fear that
you must die too."

"He did it first," said the white sheep. And with those words he died.

LITTELL'S LIVING AGE.

In 1876 The Living Age enters upon its thirty-third year. It has never
failed to receive the warmest support of the best men and journals of
the country, and has met with constantly increasing success. Having
recently absorbed its younger competitor, "EVERY SATURDAY," it is now
without a rival in its special field. A Weekly Magazine of sixty-four
pages, it gives more than

THREE AND A QUARTER THOUSAND

double-column octavo pages of reading-matter yearly, forming four large
volumes. It presents in an inexpensive form, considering its great
amount of matter with freshness, owing to its weekly issue, and with a
satisfactory completeness attempted by no other publication, the best
Essays, Reviews, Criticisms, Tales, Sketches of Travel and Discovery,
Poetry, Scientific, Biographical, Historical and Political information,
from the entire body of Foreign Periodical Literature.

During the coming year, the serial and short stories of the

LEADING FOREIGN AUTHORS

will be given, together with an amount unapproached by any other
periodical in the world, of the best literary and scientific matter of
the day from the pens of the above-named, and many other foremost
living Essayists, Scientists, Critics, Discoverers, and Editors,
representing every department of Knowledge and Progress.

The importance of The Living Age to every American reader, as the only
satisfactorily fresh and COMPLETE compilation of an indispensable
current literature,&mdash;indispensable because it embraces the productions
of

THE ABLEST LIVING WRITERS

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
