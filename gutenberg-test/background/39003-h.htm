<h3>SPEECH</h3>

<h4>OF</h4>

<h2>HON. JOHN P. JONES,</h2>

<h4>OF NEVADA.</h4>

<p class="center">On the bill (S. 2350) authorizing the issue of Treasury notes on deposits of silver
bullion.</p>


<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada, said:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">President</span>: The question now about to be discussed by this
body is in my judgment the most important that has attracted the
attention of Congress or the country since the formation of the Constitution.
It affects every interest, great and small, from the slightest
concern of the individual to the largest and most comprehensive
interest of the nation.</p>

<p>The measure under consideration was reported by me from the
Committee on Finance. It is hardly necessary for me to say, however,
that it does not fully reflect my individual views regarding
the relation which silver should bear to the monetary circulation of
the country or of the world. I am, at all times and in all places, a
firm and unwavering advocate of the free and unlimited coinage of
silver, not merely for the reason that silver is as ancient and honorable
a money metal as gold, and equally well adapted for the money
use, but for the further reason that, looking at the annual yield
from the mines, the entire supply that can come to the mints will at
no time be more than is needed to maintain at a steady level the
prices of commodities among a constantly increasing population.</p>

<p>In view, however, of the great divergency of views prevailing on
the subject, the length of time which it was believed might be consumed
in the endeavor to secure that full and rightful measure of legislation
to which the people are entitled, and the possibility that
this session of Congress might terminate without affording the country
some measure of substantial relief, I was willing, rather than
have the country longer subjected to the baleful and benumbing influences
set in motion by the demonetization act of 1873, to join with
other members of the Finance Committee in reporting the bill now
under consideration.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I wish at the outset of the discussion to
say that I hold myself free to vote for any amendment that may be
offered that may tend to make the bill a more perfect measure of relief,
and that may be more in consonance with my individual views.</p>


<p class="caption">THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY.</p>

<p>The condition of this country to-day, Mr. President, is well calculated
to awaken the interest and arouse the attention of thinking
men. It can be safely asserted that no period of the world's history
can exhibit a people at once so numerous and homogeneous, living
under one form of government, speaking a common language, enjoying
the same degree of personal and political liberty, and sharing, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p004" id="Page_p004">[4]</a></span>so equal a degree, the same civilization as the population of the
United States. Eminently practical and ingenious, of indomitable
will, untiring energy, and unfailing hope; favored by nature with a
domain of imperial expanse, with soil and climate of unequaled variety
and beneficence, with every natural condition that can conduce
to individual prosperity and national glory, it might well be expected
that among such a people industry, agriculture, commerce, art, and
science would reach an extent and perfection of development surpassing
anything ever known in the history of mankind.</p>

<p>In some respects this expectation would appear to have been well
founded. For several years past our farmers have produced an
annual average of 400,000,000 bushels of wheat. Our oat crop for
1888 was 700,000,000 bushels, our corn crop 2,000,000,000 bushels,
our cotton crop 7,000,000 bales. In that year our coal mines yielded
170,000,000 tons of coal, our furnaces produced 6,500,000 tons of pig
iron and 3,000,000 tons of steel. Our gold and silver mines add more
than $100,000,000 a year to the world's stock of the precious metals.
We print 16,000 newspapers and periodicals, have in operation
154,000 miles of railroad and 250,000 miles of telegraph. The value
of our manufactured products at the date of the last census was
$5,400,000,000. Our farm lands at the same time were estimated at
$10,000,000,000, our cattle at $2,000,000,000, our railroads at $6,000,000,000,
our houses at $14,000,000,000. It is not too much to say that
there has been an increase of fully 50 per cent. in those values since
the taking of the census of 1880. Our national wealth to-day is
reasonably estimated at over $60,000,000,000.</p>

<p>Figures and facts such as these in the history of a young nation
bespeak the presence not merely of great natural opportunities, but
of a people marvelously apt and forceful. From such results should
be anticipated the highest attainable prosperity and happiness.
Our population is alert, aspiring, and buoyant, not given to needless
repining or aimless endeavor, but, with fixity of purpose, presses
ever eagerly on, utilizing every conception of the brain to supplement
and multiply the possibilities of the hand, and at every turn
subordinating the subtle forces of nature to the best and wisest purposes
of man. No equal number of persons on the globe better deserve
success, or are better adapted for its enjoyment.</p>

<p>But instead of finding, as we should find, happiness and contentment
broadcast throughout our great domain, there are heard from
all directions, even in this Republic, resounding cries of distress and
dissatisfaction. Every trade and occupation exhibits symptoms of
uneasiness and distrust. The farmer, the artisan, the merchant,&mdash;all
share in the general complaint that times are hard, that business
is "dull." The farmer is in debt, and is not realizing, on the
products of his labor, the wherewithal to meet either his deferred
or his current obligations; the artisan, when at work, finds himself
compelled to share his earnings with some relative or friend who is
out of employment; the merchant who buys his goods on time finds
little profit in sales, and difficulty in making his payments.</p>


<p class="caption">WHAT IS THE DIFFICULTY?</p>

<p>What can it be, Mr. President, that has thus brought to naught
all the careful estimates and painstaking computations, not of thousands,
nor of hundreds of thousands, but of millions, of keen, shrewd,
and far-seeing men? Our people take an intelligent interest in their
business; they look ahead; they endeavor, as far as possible, to estimate
correctly their assets and liabilities, so that on the day of reckoning
they may be found ready. Why this universal failure of all
classes to compute correctly in advance their situation on the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p005" id="Page_p005">[5]</a></span>ing
pay-day? What potent and sinister drug has been secretly
introduced into the veins of commerce that has caused the blood to
flow so sluggishly&mdash;that has narcotized the commercial and industrial
world?</p>

<p>All have been looking for the cause, and many think they have
discovered it. With some it is "over-production," with others either
a "high tariff" or a "tariff not sufficiently high." Some think it
due to trusts and combinations, others to improved methods of production,
or because the crops are overabundant or not abundant
enough. Some ascribe the difficulty to speculation; others, to
"strikes." All sorts of insufficient and contradictory causes are
assigned for the same general and universal complaint. However
inadequate in themselves, they serve to emphasize the universal recognition
of a difficulty whose cause without close inquiry is likely
to elude detection. But the evil is of such magnitude, it is so widespread
and pervasive, that, without a knowledge of its cause, all
effort at mitigation of its effects can but add to the confusion and
intensify the difficulty.</p>

<p>It behooves us, therefore, as we value the prosperity and happiness
of our people, to set ourselves diligently to the inquiry: What
is the cause of the unrest and discontent now universally prevailing?</p>


<p class="caption">ONE SYMPTOM COMMON TO ALL INDUSTRIES.</p>

<p>In surveying the question broadly, to discover whether there is
anything that affects the situation in common from the standpoint
of varying occupations, we find one, and only one, uniform and unfailing
characteristic; the prices of all commodities and of all property,
except in money centers, have fallen, and continue falling.
Such a phenomenon as a constant and progressive fall in the general
range of prices has always exercised so baleful an influence on the
prosperity of mankind that it never fails to arrest attention.</p>

<p>History gives evidence of no more prolific source of human misery
than a persistent and long continued fall in the general range of
prices. But, although exercising so pernicious an influence, it is not
itself a cause, but an effect.</p>

<p>When a fall of prices is found operating, not on one article or class
of articles alone, but on the products of all industries; when found
to be not confined to any one climate, country, or race of people, but
to diffuse itself over the civilized world; when it is found not to be
a characteristic of any one year, but to go on progressively for a
series of years, it becomes manifest that it does not and can not arise
from local, temporary or subordinate causes, but must have its genesis
and development in some principle of universal application.</p>


<p class="caption">WHAT PRODUCES A GENERAL FALL OF PRICES?</p>

<p>What, then, is it that produces a general decline of prices in any
country? It is produced by a shrinkage in the volume of money
relatively to population and business, which has never yet failed to
cause an increase in the value of the money unit, and a consequent
decrease in the price of the commodities for which such unit is exchanged.
If the volume of money in circulation be made to bear a direct
and steady ratio to population and business, prices will be maintained
at a steady level, and, what is of supreme importance, money
will be kept of unchanging value. With an advancing civilization,
in which a large volume of business is conducted on a basis of credit
extending over long periods, it is of the uttermost importance that
money, which is the measure of all equities, should be kept unchanging
in value through time.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p006" id="Page_p006">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">EFFECT OF A REDUCTION IN THE MONEY-VOLUME.</p>

<p>A reduction in the volume of money relatively to population and
business, or, (to state the proposition in another form) a volume
which remains stationary while population and business are increasing,
has the effect of increasing the value of each unit of money, by
increasing its purchasing power.</p>

<p>It is only within a comparatively recent period that an increasing
value in the money unit could produce such widespread disturbance
of industry as it produces to-day. In the rude periods of society
commerce was by barter; and even for thousands of years after the
introduction of money, credit, where known at all, was extremely
limited. Under such circumstances changes in the volume and in
the value of money, while operating to the disadvantage of society
as a whole, could not instantly or seriously affect any one individual.
An increase of 25 per cent. in one year in the value of the money
unit&mdash;a change which now, by reason of existing contracts or
debts, would entail universal bankruptcy and ruin&mdash;would not be
seriously felt by a community in which no such contracts or debts
existed, in which payments were immediate or at short intervals,
and each individual parted with his money almost as soon as he
received it.</p>

<p>Such proportion of the annual increase in the value of the money
unit as could attach to any one month, week, or day would be
wholly insignificant, and as most transactions were closed on the
spot, no appreciable loss could accrue to any individual. Such loss
as did accrue was shared in and averaged among the whole community,
making it the veriest trifle upon any individual. But how
is it in our day?</p>


<p class="caption">THAT EFFECT INTENSIFIED AS CIVILIZATION ADVANCES.</p>

<p>The inventions of the past one hundred years have established a
new order of the ages. The revolution of industry and commerce,
effected by the adaptation of steam and other forces of nature to the
uses of man, have given to civilization an impetus exceeding anything
known in the former experience of mankind. Under the operation
of the new system, the rapidity and intensity with which,
within that period, civilization has developed, is due in great part
to an economic feature unknown to ancient civilization and practically
unknown even to civilized society until the present century.
That feature is the time-contract, by which alone leading minds are
enabled to project in advance enterprises of magnitude and moment.
It is only through intelligent and far-seeing plans and projections
that in a complex and minutely classified system of industry great
bodies of men can be kept in uninterrupted employment.</p>

<p>We have 22,000,000 workmen in this country. In order that they
may be kept uninterruptedly employed it is absolutely necessary
that business contracts and obligations be made long in advance.
Accordingly, we read almost daily of the inception of industrial undertakings
requiring years to fulfill. It is not too much to say that
the suspension for one season of the making of time-contracts would
close the factories, furnaces, and machine shops of all civilized
countries.</p>

<p>The natural concomitant of such a system of industry is the elaborate
system of debt and credit which has grown up with it, and is
indispensable to it. Any serious enhancement in the value of the
unit of money between the time of making a contract or incurring a
debt and the date of fulfillment or maturity always works hardship
and frequently ruin to the contractor or debtor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p007" id="Page_p007">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Three-fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted
on borrowed capital. Three-fourths of the homes and farms
that stand in the name of the actual occupants have been bought
on time, and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged for the
payment of some part of the purchase-money.</p>

<p>Under the operation of a shrinkage in the volume of money this
enormous mass of borrowers, at the maturity of their respective debts,
though nominally paying no more than the amount borrowed, with
interest, are, in reality, in the amount of the principal alone, returning
a percentage of value greater than they received&mdash;more than in
equity they contracted to pay and oftentimes more, in substance, than
they profited by the loan. To the man of business this percentage
in many cases constitutes the difference between success and failure.
Thus a shrinkage in the volume of money is the prolific source of
bankruptcy and ruin. It is the canker that, unperceived and unsuspected,
is eating out the prosperity of our people. By reason of the
almost universal inattention to the nature and functions of money
this evil is permitted, unobserved, to work widespread ruin and disaster.
So subtle is it in its operations that it eludes the vigilance
of the most acute. It baffles all foresight and calculation; it sets at
naught all industry, all energy, all enterprise.</p>


<p class="caption">CONTRAST OF EFFECTS PRODUCED BY AN INCREASING AND A DECREASING MONEY-VOLUME.</p>

<p>The difference in the effects produced by an increasing and a
decreasing money-volume has not escaped the attention of observant
writers.</p>

<p>David Hume, in his Essay on Money, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is certain that since the discovery of the mines in America industry has increased
in all the nations of Europe. * * We find that in every kingdom into
which money begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly, everything takes
a new face; labor and industry gain life; the merchant becomes more enterprising,
the manufacturer more diligent and skillful, and even the farmer follows his plow
with greater alacrity and attention.  * * * It is of no manner of consequence with
regard to the domestic happiness of a state whether money be in a greater or less
quantity. The good policy of the magistrate consists only in keeping it, if possible,
still increasing; because by that means he keeps alive a spirit of industry in the
nation and increases the stock of labor, in which consists all real power and riches.
A nation whose money decreases is actually at that time weaker and more miserable
than another nation which possesses no more money, but is on the increasing
hand.</p></div>

<p>William H. Crawford, Secretary of the Treasury, in a report to
Congress, dated 12th February, 1820, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All intelligent writers on currency agree that when it is decreasing in amount
poverty and misery must prevail.</p></div>

<p>Mr. R. M. T. Hunter, in a report to the United States Senate
in 1852, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Of all the great effects produced upon human society by the discovery of America,
there were probably none so marked as those brought about by the great influx
of the precious metals from the New World to the Old. European industry had
been declining under the decreasing stock of the precious metals and an appreciating
standard of values; human ingenuity grew dull under the paralyzing influences
of declining profits, and capital absorbed nearly all that should have been
divided between it and labor. But an increase of the precious metals, in such
quantity as to check this tendency, operated as a new motive power to the machinery
of commerce. Production was stimulated by finding the advantages of a
change in the standard on its side. Instead of being repressed by having to pay
more than it had stipulated for the use of capital, it was stimulated by paying
less. Capital, too, was benefited, for new demands were created for it by the
new uses which a general movement in industrial pursuits had developed; so
that if it lost a little by a change in the standard, it gained much more in the
greater demand for its use, which added to its capacity for reproduction, and to
its real value.</p>

<p>The mischief would be great, indeed, if all the world were to adopt but one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p008" id="Page_p008">[8]</a></span>
the precious metals as the standard of value. To adopt gold alone would diminish
the specie currency more than one-half; and the reduction the other way, should
silver be taken as the only standard, would be large enough to prove highly disastrous
to the human race.</p></div>

<p>The Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, 1859 (article Precious Metals, by J.
R. McCulloch), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A fall in the value of the precious metals, caused by the greater facility of
their production, or by the discovery of new sources of supply, depends in no degree
on theories of philosophers or the decision of statesmen or legislators,
but is the result of circumstances beyond human control; and although, like a fall
of rain after a long course of dry weather, it may be prejudicial to certain classes,
it is beneficial to an incomparably greater number, including all who are engaged
in industrial pursuits, and is, speaking generally, of great public or national advantage.</p></div>

<p>Ernest Seyd, 1868 (Bullion, page 613), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Upon this one point all authorities on the subject are agreed, to wit, that the
large increase in the supply of gold has given a universal impetus to trade, commerce,
and industry, and to general social development and progress.</p></div>

<p>The American Review (1876) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Diminishing money and falling prices are not only oppressive upon debtors, of
whom, in modern times, states are the greatest, but they cause stagnation in business,
reduced production, and enforced idleness. Falling markets annihilate profits,
and as it is only the expectation of gain which stimulates the investment of
capital in operations, inadequate employment is found for labor, and those who are
employed can only be so upon the condition of diminished wages. An increasing
amount of money, and consequently augmenting prices, are attended by results
precisely the contrary. Production is stimulated by the profits resulting from
advancing prices; labor is consequently in demand and better paid, and the general
activity and buoyancy insure to capital a wider demand and higher remuneration.</p></div>


<p class="caption">PRICE THE INDEX OF THE VALUE OF MONEY.</p>

<p>There can be no truer index of the value of money than the general
range of prices. Price is the mercury by the rise and fall of
which the heat and struggle of industrial and business life are daily
measured and made plain. Where the tendency of this indicator
continues downward, there is no more certain sign that money is increasing
in value.</p>

<p>During a period of falling prices the fear of impending calamity
hangs like a pall over the business of the country. Notwithstanding
unremitting efforts, men feel themselves constantly on the edge
of disaster. Gloomy foreboding and timidity take the place of confidence
and courage.</p>

<p>A shrinking volume of money is the most insidious foe with which
civilization has to contend.</p>

<p>It is my firm conviction that the inexpressible miseries inflicted
upon mankind by war, pestilence, and famine have been less cruel,
unpitying, and unrelenting than the persistent and remorseless
exactions which this inexorable enemy has made upon society. As
the volume of money contracts prices decline, and with the decline
of prices comes stagnation of industry, and the relegation to idleness
of thousands of willing workmen. Capitalists become unwilling
to invest their money in enterprises that employ labor while
the products of that labor are constantly decreasing in price. During
all periods of falling prices therefore money capital is withdrawn
from active industry and seeks investment in bonds and other forms
of money-futures yielding fixed incomes. For although the rate of
interest in many such cases may be low, the capitalist is compensated
for this by the enhancement in the purchasing power of each
dollar of the principal and by the necessarily greater command it
secures over the products of labor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p009" id="Page_p009">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Avoiding the very purpose for which it was devised, money at
such times seeks seclusion and declines to circulate. Its owner
finds that he can better afford to leave it idle in a vault or bury it in
the earth, than subject it to the probability of diminution by investing
it in business on a constantly falling market. Thus, contrary
to all principles of progress and of natural justice, the man who
keeps his money idle, and deprives society of its use, is rewarded
by an unearned increment, while he who puts his money into active
business, where industry and labor may profit by it is punished by
unmerited loss.</p>

<p>Under such conditions it is impossible for a community to reach
that degree of material progress which, under proper circumstances,
it would readily attain. At every turn distress and discouragement
stare the people in the face. In every town and village
men, willing to work, stand idle. Even their misfortune does
not end with themselves, for not only are they a tax upon their
friends, lessening to some extent the meager income of those who
give them temporary assistance, but their necessary and eager competition
for the little work that offers, tends to reduce the compensation
of those to whom they are thus indebted. Stores, workshops,
and factories, unoccupied and unused, are found in every direction.
Crime increases, bankruptcies multiply, and even though the aggregate
of wealth augments, it is unjustly distributed, and consequently
barren of beneficent results.</p>


<p class="caption">A GLANCE AT THE HISTORY OF MONEY.</p>

<p>The system of relying upon the precious metals as money has long
been known as the Automatic system. Accurately, it should be
called the <i>Accidental</i> system. It has been called "automatic" because,
so long as money was made to depend solely upon the yield
of the mines, the supply regulated itself by what was believed to be
a natural method, namely, by the expenditure of labor in its production,
and was limited only by the rude obstacles which nature
opposes to the production of the metals. The necessity of expending
this labor placed the money volume of any country beyond the
control of the kings and conquerors who, in the primitive periods of
society, exercised despotic sway over their subjects. It was undoubtedly
better for the people of those early times to risk the
accidents of production than the follies and sinister designs of rulers.</p>

<p>This automatic system grew out of barter. It is a survival from
the period when articles were exchanged directly, not for gold and
silver as money, but for gold and silver as commodities&mdash;on the basis
of their cost of production&mdash;as in the case of the articles for which
they were exchanged.</p>

<p>There have been the same evolutions of progress in money as in
all other things. In the rude original of society no kind of money
was possible. The first trade was by barter, after which, some one
or more commodities attainable in the vicinage, and in general use
and demand were selected as the common media through which
all exchanges were filtered. The use for that purpose of various
metals by weight followed next, and, at a succeeding stage, gold,
silver, and copper by weight, and after this their use in the form of
coins, the value of which coincided with the bullion-value, which
must necessarily be the case when free coinage is permitted.</p>

<p>It may be not uninteresting in this connection to have a general
view of the materials which, at different epochs of the world's history,
have been used as money. I therefore present a tabular statement
giving those particulars in chronological order.</p>

<p>An analysis of this table will show how carefully even the most
primitive communities guarded against a too restricted money volume.</p>

<p>The materials chosen to serve the purpose of money in each country
during the early history of society were, it will be observed, such
as at the time and place would be of sufficient quantity or volume to
insure against any sudden deprivation of supply. In countries where
the chase was common, the skins of wild animals were used as money;
in maritime communities, shells; in pastoral countries, cattle; in the
early history of agriculture, grain; in early mining periods, base
metal; in primitive manufacturing ages, nails, glass, musket-balls,
strips of cotton, etc.</p>

<p>As communities developed, and commerce between them began,
substances somewhat common to all countries, portable and indestructible,
such as the precious metals, came to be more, and other
substances less, resorted to. By reason of their great beauty those
metals were always in demand, even among barbarous peoples, for
purposes of ornament and decoration. Because of their universal
use for such purposes they came to be recognized as things for which
anything else could with safety be exchanged, and as society advanced,
and it came to be recognized that some medium should be
adopted in which to make all exchanges, those metals were naturally
selected for the purpose, so that, together, they became, as it were,
a common denominator of value. Their selection proved a convenient
method of storing away wealth in a form that commanded at all
times every other form of wealth. They had always passed by weight
wherever used, but as society became better organized, and its methods
more complex, it became necessary, in order to insure against
fraud, to form them into pieces convenient for handling, and to invest
them distinctly with the function of money, so that, by law,
they became a universal solvent for debts and demands, the stamp
of the government placed on the coin testifying to its weight and
fineness.</p>

<p>Both metals, as shown by the table, have been concurrently used
as money for thousands of years&mdash;not only since the dawn of history,
but from a period anterior to any historical records. The oldest
annals show that they had already been employed as circulating
media and that their relative values, or the ratio of their exchange
for one another, had already been established. Gold and silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p013" id="Page_p013">[13]</a></span>
were used as money in Palestine as early as the year 1900 B. C. We
read in the Bible that Abraham weighed to Ephron the Hittite 400
shekels of silver, "current money with the merchant." An inscription
on the temple of Karnak, of the date of 1600 B. C. mentions
those metals as materials in which tribute was paid.</p>

<p>But long anterior even to these dates, both metals had been used,
as, among the relics of the bronze age of the prehistoric era, ornaments
of both gold and silver have been found. Gold, being the
less abundant of the two metals, has had the higher value; but the
ratio between the two has been marvelously steady, taking into
account the great sweep of ages during which they have been used
as money. This will be seen by reference to the following tables of
ratios. I will first take their relative values during ancient times.</p>

<p>By reference to the foregoing table it will be observed that the increase
in the supply of gold in Europe, consisting of the spoils of the
Orient, gathered by Alexander the Great, and brought by him to
Greece, had the effect of decreasing the value of that metal so that
instead of being exchangeable at the ratio of 1 to about 13&frac12; of silver,
as formerly, gold became depressed, 1 ounce of it exchanging
for only 10 ounces of silver. Later, when Julius C&aelig;sar extended his
conquering arms into Gaul, and sent to Rome the accumulations of
treasure amassed by him, the value of gold by reason of the increased
supply was again depressed, so that an ounce of it was exchangeable
for only 8.93 ounces of silver. With these exceptions it may be said
that the relation of silver to gold for sixteen hundred years before
the time of Christ had varied only from the ratio of 1 to 12 to that of
1 to 13.33. Silver at no time during all this period fell below 13.50
to 1 of gold.</p>

<p>Looking, now, at the relative values of gold and silver from the time
of Christ to the discovery of America, we find the ratio between the
two metals to be as follows:</p>

<p>By the foregoing table it will be seen that in the three hundred
and seventy-five years from 1497 to 1872 the maximum separation of
the metals was only as 1 to 16.25&mdash;notwithstanding the widest divergencies
during that long period in the yield of the two metals
from the mines. It will be observed that all the later quotations are
from the London market, but it is a significant fact that in France,
where, by the law of 7 Germinal, <i>An</i> XI, (1803,) free coinage was permitted
to both metals, at the ratio of 15&frac12; of silver to 1 of gold, for a
period of seventy years, and until the coinage of silver was limited,
there was at no time the slightest variance from that relation.</p>

<p>When silver was deprived of the full money function, and all the
money-work of society was placed on gold, the metals began to separate.
The following table shows the degree of that separation from
year to year:</p>

<p>The foregoing figures show that it is only since the legislative proscription
of silver by Germany and the United States, and the closing
of all the European mints to its coinage, that any material
change took place in the ratio between the two metals, which conclusively
demonstrates that the present divergence in the relative
values of the two metals is directly due to the legal outlawry of silver
and not to natural causes.</p>

<p>Not only has the concurrent use of the two metals as money had the
sanction of all time, but the approval of the greatest minds of history,
and, when not blinded by self-interest, the approval of practical
and experienced financial minds. So well recognized is this
fact that I need only cite a few instances of such approval.</p>

<p>Alexander Hamilton said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To annul the use of either of the metals as money is <i>to abridge the quantity of
circulating medium</i>, and is liable to all the objections which arise from a comparison
of the <i>benefits of a full with the evils of a scanty circulation</i>. (Report to Congress,
1791.)</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p017" id="Page_p017">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to Hamilton, indorsed this view,
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I return you the report on the mint. I concur with you that the unit <i>must stand
on both metals</i>. (Letter to Hamilton, February, 1792.)</p></div>

<p>In his "Recherches sur l'or et sur l'argent," 1843, L&eacute;on Fanchet
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If all the nations of Europe adopted the system of Great Britain, the price of
gold would be raised beyond measure, and we should see produced in Europe a
most lamentable result. The Government can not decree that legal tender shall
be only gold, in place of silver, for that would be to decree a revolution, and the
most dangerous of all, because it would be a revolution leading to unknown results
(<i>qui marcherait vers l'inconnu</i>).</p></div>

<p>In a memoir read before the French Institute in 1868, M. Wolowski
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The suppression of silver would bring on a veritable revolution. Gold would
augment in value with a rapid and constant progress, which would break the faith
of contracts and aggravate the situation of all debtors, including the nation. It
would add at one stroke of the pen at least three milliards to the twelve milliards
of the public debt.</p></div>

<p>In a debate in the French Senate on January 28, 1870, Senator Dumas
eloquently pleaded for caution in dealing with a subject of such
farreaching importance as the demonetization of one of the money
metals. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those who approach these questions for the first time decide them at once.
Those who study them with care hesitate. Those who are obliged practically to
decide doubt and stop, overwhelmed with the weight of the enormous responsibility.</p>

<p>The quantities of the precious metals which are now sufficient may become insufficient,
and we should proceed with great prudence before we diminish that
which constitutes a part of the riches of the human race. Sometimes gold takes
the place of silver. Sometimes silver takes the place of gold. <i>This keeps up the
general equilibrium.</i> Nobody can guaranty that the present vast production of
gold will continue. The <i>placers</i> are found on the surface of the earth, and may
be exhausted by the very facility of working them. Silver presents itself in the
form of subterranean veins. Science may contribute to accelerate its extraction.
In presence of the unknown, which dominates the future, we should practice a
prudent reserve.</p></div>

<p>Before a French monetary convention in 1869 testimony was given
by M. Wolowski, by Baron Rothschild, and by M. Rouland, governor
of the Bank of France.</p>

<p>M. Wolowski said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The sum total of the precious metals is reckoned at fifty milliards, one-half gold
and one-half silver. If, by a stroke of the pen, they suppress one of these metals
in the monetary service, they double the demand for the other metal, to the ruin
of all debtors.</p></div>

<p>M. Rouland, governor of the Bank of France, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have not to do with ideal theories. The two moneys have actually co-existed
since the origin of human society. They co-exist because the two together
are necessary, by their quantity, to meet the needs of circulation. This necessity
of the two metals, has it ceased to exist? Is it established that the quantity of
actual and prospective gold is such that we can now renounce the use of silver
without disaster?</p></div>

<p>Baron Rothschild said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The simultaneous employment of the two precious metals is satisfactory and
gives rise to no complaint. Whether gold or silver dominates for the time being,
it is always true that the two metals concur together in forming the monetary circulation
of the world, and it is the general mass of the two metals combined which
serves as the measure of the value of things. The suppression of silver would
amount to a veritable destruction of values without any compensation.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p018" id="Page_p018">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>At the session (October 30, 1873) of the Belgian Monetary Commission,
Professor Laveleye, one of the most luminous writers on economic
subjects, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Debtors, and among them the state, have the right to pay in gold or silver, and
this right can not be taken away without disturbing the relation of debtors and
creditors, to the prejudice of debtors, to the extent of perhaps one-half, certainly
of one-third. To increase all debts at a blow (<i>brusquement</i>) is a measure so violent,
so revolutionary, that I can not believe that the Government will propose it
or that the Chambers will vote it.</p></div>


<p class="caption">WHY WAS THE AUTOMATIC SYSTEM INTERFERED WITH?</p>

<p>Some thirteen years ago, as Chairman of the Monetary Commission
appointed by Congress to investigate the causes of the changes
in the relative values of the precious metals, I submitted to this
body a report, in which I took occasion to refer to the motives which
evidently influenced the creditor classes of the western world in destroying
the automatic system of money. From that Report I quote
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The world has generally favored, theoretically if not practically, the automatic
metallic system, and adjusted its business to it. Some nations adopted one metal
as their standard, and some the other, and some adopted both. Those that adopted
both metals served as a balance-wheel to steady with exactness their relative value.
The practical effect of all of this was the same as if all nations had adopted both,
because it secured the entire stock of both at a fixed equivalency for the transaction
of the business of the world. While some nations have changed their money
metal, or, having had paper money, have resumed specie payments in one metal,
the policy of a general demonetization of one of the metals was first broached only
about twenty years ago. About ten years later a formidable propaganda was organized
to fasten that policy upon the commercial world.</p>

<p>This new school of financial theorists advocate the retention of metal as the
material of money, but favor its subjection to governmental interference in every
respect. Whenever new mines are discovered, or old ones yield or promise to
yield more abundantly, instead of freely accepting their product in accordance
with the automatic theory, they advocate its rejection through the restriction or
the absolute prohibition of the coinage of either or both metals, or through the
limitation or the abolition of the legal-tender function of one of them. Whenever
the interests of the creditor and income classes seem to be in danger of being impaired
by an increase in the volume and decrease in the value of money, or in
other words, by a general rise in prices, these modern theorists are clamorous in
double-standard countries for the demonetization of one of the money metals, and
in single-standard countries for the shifting of the money function from the metal
which promises the most to the one that promises the least abundant supply.
They are extremely anxious for the retention of the <i>material</i> of which the money-standard
is composed when such material is rising in value and prices are falling,
and exceedingly apprehensive of the evil and inconvenience which they predict
as sure to result from changing it.</p>

<p>Whenever a fall in prices occurs, through either a natural or artificial contraction
in the volume of money, they maintain that it is due to antecedent inflation
and extravagance, or to overproduction through persistent and reckless industry;
if the contraction be natural, that it can not be helped, and if artificial, that though
it may inflict great temporary losses on the masses of the people, it will be sure to
result in their ultimate benefit, and they console the sufferers with the comforting
assurance that such contraction is necessary in order to reach the lowest depths
of that "<i>hard pan</i>" whose foundations they have previously undermined by demonetizing
one of the metals, and upon which alone they claim that money, capital,
and labor can securely and harmoniously rest. But when the material composing
the standard is falling in value and prices are rising, they immediately
discover that the maintenance of the value of the standard is the all-important
consideration, and that its material is of no importance whatever and should be at
once changed to "<i>redress the situation</i>." After having reduced one of the metals to
a commodity by depriving it of the money function, these theorists complacently
point to the resulting fluctuations in the value as a justification of the act producing
them, and as a conclusive proof of the unfitness for money of the demonetized
metal. * * *</p>

<p>Metallic money, on this theory, is no longer automatic, but is as completely subjected
to governmental control for all injurious purposes as paper money. But,
unlike paper money, the control over this kind of metallic money can only be exercised
in the baneful direction of decreasing its volume, and thereby making
property cheaper and money scarcer and dearer.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p019" id="Page_p019">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This is a one-sided system, which can operate only in the interest of the security
creditor, the usurer, and pawnbroker, whom it enables, through the falling prices
which itself occasions, to swallow up the shrunken resources of the debtor, but
is impotent to protect the interests of the unsecured business creditor, the debtor,
or society, when, from any cause, the supply of the money metals becomes deficient.</p>

<p>The world has expended a vast amount of labor in the production of the precious
metals, and has made great sacrifices in upholding the automatic metallic
system of money, and has a right to insist that it shall be consistently let alone to
work out its own conclusions, or that it be abandoned.</p>
</div>

<p>The history of the subsequent struggle to remonetize silver only
serves to illustrate and emphasize the correctness of that statement
of the case.</p>

<p>Between 1810 and 1849, according to Tooke and Newmarch (recognized
authorities on the subject), gold increased in value 145 per
cent. which is equivalent to a fall in the general range of prices of
59 per cent. No movement was then made or suggestion offered by
the debtors, or by any class of the community, to add any new
money-metal to the metals already in use, with the view of increasing
the volume of money, so that the equity of time contracts might
be maintained, and the value of the unit of money kept at a steady
and unchanging level.</p>

<p>But as soon as the discoveries of gold were made in the alluvial
deposits of California and Australia, or rather as soon as it was suspected
that money would thereby become considerably increased
in volume, the annuitants and income classes, the creditors everywhere,
took steps to avert what they characterized as a great calamity.
They openly declared their purpose, by every means in their
power, to prevent a decline in the value of money, so that the purchasing
power of their incomes might not be reduced. They determined
to go to any length in order to prevent the rise of prices
which their aggressive instincts led them to fear would follow the
additions to the money volume of the world by the natural and much
needed yield of the mines.</p>

<p>The fiat therefore went forth that one of the metals must be discarded.</p>


<p class="caption">THE PROPOSITION FIRST MADE TO DEMONETIZE GOLD.</p>

<p>If anything were needed to demonstrate that the reason for the demonetization
of silver was the cupidity of the creditor classes&mdash;the
money-lenders, annuitants, and those in receipt of fixed incomes&mdash;and
that it was not any defect inhering in the metal silver, nor any
change in its adaptability to subserve the purposes of money, it is to
be found in the significant fact that the metal first selected for demonetization
was not silver but gold&mdash;that metal which has since
become the idol of the money-changers, and which is now declared
to be the only "natural" money. The openly-avowed determination
was to increase the value of money, and in order to accomplish that
purpose the metal which promised the largest yield was to be condemned
and stripped of its ancient monetary function. So strongly
was this determination set forth, so earnestly was it presented, and
so urgently pressed on the ground of duty that its achievement came
to be regarded as the fulfillment of a high moral purpose.</p>

<p>It was with gold then as it came to be with silver afterward,
and as it always is with whatever interferes with the interests of
privileged classes, intrenched in power and prerogative,&mdash;the determination
to destroy it being arrived at, measures were taken to prove
that the public good required its destruction. While the purpose
was to discard the metal, whether gold or silver, which threatened
most immediately and seriously to reduce the purchasing power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p020" id="Page_p020">[20]</a></span>
money, the argument was that a decrease in the purchasing power of
money was a calamity against the happening of which every energy
should be directed.</p>

<p>The privileged classes found then, as they find now, able and ingenious
advocates and defenders among the literary and educated
guilds of the period. The celebrated De Quincy, in England, attempted
to prove, and to his own satisfaction did prove upon figures
drawn from his fears and a brilliant imagination, that the least
yield of gold to be expected from the mines of California and Australia
for an indefinite period in the future, was the yearly sum of
$350,000,000.</p>

<p>M. Chevalier, in France, vehemently proclaimed the necessity of
discarding one of the money metals, and that one not silver but gold.
In his work upon the "Fall of Gold" M. Chevalier, in 1856, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The quantity of gold annually thrown on the general market approaches in
round numbers a milliard of francs ($200,000,000). Those two countries (California
and Australia) must yet for a long series of years produce gold in such quantities
and on such conditions as to render a marked decline in its value inevitable.</p>

<p>It is absolutely certain that so vast a production should be accompanied with a
great reduction in value.</p>

<p>In no direction can a new outlet be seen sufficiently large to absorb the extraordinary
production of gold which we are now witnessing, so as to prevent a fall in
its value.</p>

<p>Unless, then, we possess a very robust faith in the immobility of human affairs,
we must regard the fall in the value of gold as an event for which we should prepare
without loss of time.</p></div>

<p>The "preparation" which Chevalier advocated was the discarding
of that metal which gave promise of the greatest abundance.
He did not attempt to hide his purpose. He boldly stated that his
object was to enhance the value of money. This object was also
clearly expressed on a later occasion by another distinguished advocate
of dear money, Mr. Victor Bonnet, of France, in the Journal des
Economistes. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The world is now saturated with the precious metals, and if there is any danger
against which it is necessary to guard, it is that this saturation should become
greater. * * *</p>

<p>If the annual production of gold is now reduced to 500,000,000 francs, let us thank
Heaven for it, and let us wish that it may not be too rapidly increased, whereby
we should be embarrassed. It is the too great abundance and not the scarcity of
metallic money which is to be apprehended.</p></div>


<p class="caption">GOLD DEMONETIZED.</p>

<p>In 1857 the German states and Austria demonetized gold; and had
it not been for the opposition of France, which insisted on retaining
the double standard, the movement might have become general on
the continent. With England, however, nothing could be done.
More than a generation had passed since it had declared for the
single standard of gold, and its creditors and income classes&mdash;the
shrewdest, most adept, and watchful of financiers&mdash;did not believe
that the large yields of gold would long continue.</p>

<p>The creditor classes of the continent, finding England immovable
and realizing that the object sought by the English creditors was
identical with their own, namely, the increase in the value of money
and the depression of prices, concluded that the common purpose
could be as well served by the demonetization of one as by that of
the other. This conclusion was emphasized by developments on the
Comstock lode whose bountiful and beneficent yield of silver was
the fitting supplement to the great discoveries of gold on the Pacific
coast. The danger of a decline in the value of money was more imminent
than ever. The annuitants became alarmed. Commissions
were sent from Europe to the Pacific coast to investigate the sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p021" id="Page_p021">[21]</a></span>ject.
The United States, too, sent a commissioner to examine into
the condition and prospects of the Comstock, and, imbued with many
of the characteristics of De Quincey and Chevalier, the United
States commissioner, in 1868, reported that if all other mines were
worked with the machinery used on the Comstock "their yield
would flood the world."</p>

<p>Like many of the present opponents of silver he was endowed with
the gift of prophecy, and accordingly we find him confidently predicting
that other and innumerable rich lodes of silver would be
found on the Pacific coast which would be worked with great profit.
The attack on gold was immediately changed to a combined attack
on silver. From that period till the present no means have been
left untried to belittle and degrade that metal, and also to disparage
those who are in favor of continuing it as one of the money
metals of the world.</p>

<p>It was then announced with all the dogmatism of authority that
silver was unfit to be used as money. Defects were suddenly discovered
in it that the scrutiny of three thousand years had failed to
disclose. Its weight and bulk were found to be insuperable obstacles
to its use as money. Yet the specific gravity of silver is no
greater now than it has been for all the ages during which it has
been used as money by all mankind, nor is it any heavier or more
bulky than it was in 1851 or 1857, when Belgium, Germany, and
Austria demonetized gold and made the "heavy," "bulky," and "inconvenient"
metal, silver, their only money metal. Silver can now
be transported from place to place with less risk and at no greater
expense than gold, and at much less cost than at any previous
period in the history of the world.</p>

<p>The objection that silver is too heavy for the pocket is an objection
common to all metallic money. We see hardly any gold in
circulation in this country&mdash;infinitely less than of silver. When our
people have a choice as to the form in which they will take money
they prefer paper representatives as being the most convenient. The
extraordinary perfection to which the arts of the engraver and paper
maker have been brought gives paper money a security against
counterfeiting and imitation far superior to any immunity which
can be claimed for the metals. The marvellous inventions of modern
times in the form of safes and vault-locks render it a matter of
practically no risk to store the metals, both silver and gold, so
that paper representatives of them may be issued. These representatives
are preferred by the general mass of the people, and have
almost entirely occupied the channels of circulation to the exclusion
of both metals. A silver certificate for $1,000 weighs no more
than a gold certificate for the same amount.</p>


<p class="caption">THE MOTIVE FOR DEMONETIZING SILVER.</p>

<p>The motive for the demonetization of silver was precisely the
same that had previously inspired the demonetization of gold. The
object was to demonetize one of the metals&mdash;that metal which promised
the greatest abundance, and which would contribute most
largely to maintaining at an equitable level the general range of
prices. The motive in both cases was to aggrandize the privileged
classes&mdash;the income and the creditor classes of the world&mdash;and by
means of a subtle and sinister manipulation of the money volume,
whose effects it is not always easy to trace to their true cause, to
practically confiscate the reward of the hard toil of the masses. To
all intent and purpose the design was to establish a new system of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p022" id="Page_p022">[22]</a></span>
slavery for the western world, of which the debtor classes among the
white races should be the victims.</p>

<p>When demonetization was determined on there was no pretense
that there was any difficulty in maintaining a parity between the two
metals at the established ratio.</p>

<p>In the official r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the doings of the French monetary commission
of 1869 the arguments upon both sides were summed up.</p>

<p>In behalf of the gold standard it was said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The rise in price which has taken place within twenty years in a great number
of articles of merchandise is evidently due to many causes, such as war, bad
harvests, and increase in consumption; but it is very probable that the depreciation
of the precious metals has contributed to it, since there has been a striking
coincidence between the rise of prices and the production of the new mines of
gold and silver. The annual production of the two metals, which was only
$80,000,000 in 1847, exceeds now $200,000,000. It has nearly tripled, and it is easy
to see that the real value of the metals has diminished. It is difficult to estimate
exactly what the diminution is, but whatever it may be it demands the attention
of governments, because it affects unfavorably all that portion of the population
whose income, remaining nominally the same, undergoes a yearly diminution
of purchasing power. As governments control the weight and standard of
money, they ought so far as possible to assure its value. And as it is admitted
that the tendency of the metals is to depreciate, this tendency should be arrested
by demonetizing one of them.</p></div>

<p>In behalf of the double standard it was replied as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Many economists argue that the precious metals, having become very abundant,
have lost 10 or 15 per cent. of their value, and that the situation must be redressed
by making money scarcer by demonetizing silver. To this it may be answered
that the great discoveries of gold of the last twenty years have injured nobody.
The new mass of gold, spreading over the whole world, has found employment in
stimulating all forms of business, and, as a consequence, the value of gold has
fallen very little. According to Mr. Newmarch, the mass of gold and silver has
augmented 3 per cent. per annum, while the mass of exchanges has augmented
more than 3 per cent. per annum, so that the equilibrium has been maintained.
And the present is an especially inopportune time to demonetize silver, because
the annual production of gold has been falling off for several years. It was
$200,000,000 in 1853, and it is now not more than $140,000,000. What will happen
to the civilized world if silver is demonetized and if gold shall then fail?</p></div>


<p class="caption">THE MOTIVE OF ENGLAND.</p>

<p>England did not adopt the gold standard until she was in a position
to become the principal creditor nation. When her forges,
furnaces, spindles, and looms were ready to supply manufactured
goods to all the world, she saw that all countries and peoples would
be compelled to pour their treasures into her lap. Her insular
position and great navy guarantied her against external assault.
Released from the anxieties and labors incident to the Napoleonic
wars, with a sturdy population of trained mechanics, and with
fields of coal and iron in abundance, she was well adapted to become
the "workshop of the world." With colonial possessions in every
sea, and with Continental Europe in ceaseless unrest, England could
rely on customers who could themselves produce nothing but raw
material and would be obliged to buy her finished products.</p>

<p>The field of industry had been recently broadened by basic inventions
of unparalleled importance&mdash;the steam-engine, the power loom,
the spinning-jenny, and a multiplicity of other devices that increased
a hundred fold the efficiency of artisan labor. England knew that
her trade would in the main be a foreign trade and her financial
dealings largely with foreign governments. She knew that from the
people of the continent, impoverished by years of struggle for existence
against the attacks of Napoleon, she could not expect immediate
payments in cash, or in commodities. Time bonds and other deferred
obligations were the media in which for the most part she
received pay, she made interest and principal payable in gold alone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p023" id="Page_p023">[23]</a></span>
and if before the date of payment the value of money should increase
it would not be to the disadvantage of the creditor. Whatever
we may think of the <i>ethics</i> of this policy, we can have no difficulty
in understanding its <i>motive</i>.</p>


<p class="caption">ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE MOTIVE.</p>

<p>As to the object which England had in view in demonetizing silver
we are left in no sort of doubt. It has been candidly admitted by
many of her financiers and publicists. The reason for her stolid adherence
to the gold standard now is the same for which she originally
demonetized silver. Her income and creditor classes are daily
in receipt of an unearned increment to their wealth by reason of that
demonetization. More candid than the advocates in this country of
the single gold standard, the writers and press of Great Britain openly
avow the object. No better testimony to the fact can be adduced
than that supplied by the royal commission appointed in 1886 to inquire
into the changes in the relative values of the precious metals.</p>

<p>At page 90, Part II, of the final report of that body, section 128,
the commission say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It must be remembered, too, that this country is largely a creditor country, of
debts payable in gold, and any change which entails a rise in the price of commodities
generally; that is to say, a diminution of the purchasing power of gold
would be to our disadvantage.</p></div>

<p>Before the British Royal Commission of 1868 on International
Coinage, Mr. Jacob Behren, an eminent British merchant and member
of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, after answering special
and technical questions, was asked, in conclusion, "if there was
anything else he wished to state." His reply was (p. 13):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I would only state that, in my opinion, the general introduction of gold all over
the world has been one of the greatest possible blessings to England. I believe
that England would be now the very poorest country in the world if the silver
standard abroad had been kept up, and gold had not been generally introduced.
Gold would otherwise have been very much reduced in value, and we should have
had all the gold poured into England. All the debts owing to us would have been
paid in the depreciated currency; and, therefore, I believe that England ought to
have taken the lead in the introduction of a gold currency abroad. We ought to
be very thankful that it has been introduced, and we ought to give every facility
to its circulation.</p></div>

<p>Sir Lyon Playfair, in a speech delivered in the English Parliament
on April 18, 1890, according to the report in the London Times of
the day following, said that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The true policy of England as the chief creditor nation of the world was to keep
perfect independence, and to refuse participation in any entangling conference
on our monetary system.</p></div>

<p>And, according to the same report, Sir Lyon Playfair, referring to
the holding of the metals together by law, said that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It was quite true that, if you yoked a cart-horse to a racer, the strength of both
would be increased but the speed of the racer would be sacrificed.</p></div>

<p>Gold is the "racer" whose "speed" must not be sacrificed, no matter
how much injury may be effected by its tendency to greater and
greater gain.</p>

<p>The weight of the enormous burden which is imposed on gold can
not be better illustrated than by a statement of this same Sir Lyon
Playfair, made in the same speech. According to the London Times
of April 19, he said that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The liabilities of the banks of Great Britain to the public amounted to &pound;621,000,000,
or about the amount of the national debt of England; but the amount of
coin or bullion to meet this liability was only &pound;35,000,000; or, deducting from
each side of the account &pound;8,000,000 locked up in the Notes Department of the
Bank of England, it was &pound;27,000,000; or only 4&frac12; per cent. of liabilities.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p024" id="Page_p024">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>On the same occasion Mr. Goschen, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
delivered an able speech, in which he gave his facts, his eloquence,
and his logic to the struggling masses of his countrymen by maintaining
the wisdom of remonetization of silver, but gave his conclusions
and his policy to the creditor classes by recommending no
disturbance of present conditions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I have contended&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">said the Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noidt">and am prepared still to contend, that I should prefer the currency of the world
to depend upon two metals rather than upon one metal. To those views I gave
expression in 1878. * * * I have always looked upon silver and gold not as
antagonistic to each other; not as being metals the price of one of which would
necessarily fall when the other rose, but I have looked upon them as partners who
together were doing the work of the currency of the world.</p></div>

<p>The English creditor classes have not been without able coadjutors
in this country. We have noticed for the last twelve or fourteen
years that zealous advocates of the gold standard, the advantages of
which are not confined to Great Britain, are to be found among the
creditor classes of the United States.</p>

<p>If the toilers of this country, from the proceeds of whose labor these
exactions have to be paid, had as little influence on the legislation of
the United States as the toilers of England have on the legislation of
that country, the creditor classes and financiers of the United States
might be as frank as those of Great Britain in admitting the object of
maintaining the single gold standard.</p>

<p>How graphically, though unintentionally, does the English poet,
Waller, in the following verse, express the advantage which the gold
standard gives to creditors everywhere, and the self-satisfaction with
which they contemplate life:</p>

<p class="poem">
The taste of hot Arabia's spice we know,<br />
Free from the scorching sun that makes it grow.<br />
Without the worm, in Persia's silk we shine,<br />
And, without planting, drink of every vine.<br />
To dig for wealth we weary not our limbs,<br />
Gold, though the heaviest metal, hither swims.<br />
Ours is the harvest where the Indians mow.<br />
We plow the deep, and reap what others sow.<br />
</p>


<p class="caption">THE MOTIVE OF GERMANY.</p>

<p>When Germany, intoxicated by her victory over France, and in
order to further cripple a fallen foe from whom she had exacted
$1,000,000,000 in gold, demonetized silver, she inflicted on her people
by the fall of prices consequent on the increase in the value of money,
more misery than all her armies of horse and foot had been able to
inflict on France. France, on the contrary, notwithstanding this
unprecedented war tribute, by keeping a sufficient volume of money
in circulation to maintain, and even advance, her range of prices,
emerged in a few years from the consequences of the greatest disaster
in her history, conscious of a triumph more complete than Germany
had achieved by all the military splendor of the war. The ransom
exacted of France was received back by her almost as soon as paid,
in exchange for the products of her industry. It is not a sign of
prosperity, Mr. President, when hundreds of thousands of people,
the best bone and sinew of a nation, are found annually emigrating;
and it is a coincidence which I merely mention, in passing,
that as soon as the effects of demonetization of silver had had time
to make themselves felt in Germany, a veritable hegira of its people
took place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p025" id="Page_p025">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>From 1873 to 1889, the emigration from Germany numbered 1,546,000
persons.</p>

<p>Students of social science everywhere recognize the statistics of illegitimacy
and of suicides as among the most powerful evidences of
monetary distress. By reference to those statistics we find that notwithstanding
the large emigration during that period the number of
illegitimate births in Germany increased from 161,294 in 1883 to 169,645
in 1888. The suicides in Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Baden&mdash;the
leading states of the German Empire&mdash;increased from 179 for each
million of population in 1868 to 196 for each million of the population
in 1876 and to 218 for each million of the population in 1882. In
Prussia alone the number of suicides in 1876 was 151 per million,
while in 1882 it was 191 per million.</p>

<p>This is part of the price which the toiling masses of Germany are
paying for the gold standard experiment, which, without their consent
their imperial government foisted upon them.</p>

<p>Bismarck made the mistake that many able men in all countries
of the western world have made and continue to make, namely, that
of attributing the commanding position of Great Britain in the commercial
and industrial world to her adoption of the gold standard.
Bismarck mistook for cause and effect what was a mere coincidence,
the result of exceptional conditions, as did those of our legislators
in 1873, who happened to know anything whatever of the nature of
the act demonetizing silver. The belief of some of the most far-sighted
statesmen of Great Britain has been that she secured her
position, not by reason of the gold standard, but in spite of it.</p>

<p>In a speech delivered at Glasgow, in November, 1873, after the
alteration by Germany in her monetary standard, Mr. Disraeli said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The monetary disturbance which has occurred, and is now to a certain extent
acting very injuriously upon trade, I attribute to the great changes which the
Governments of Europe are making in reference to their standard of value. Our
gold standard is not the cause of our commercial prosperity, but the consequence
of that prosperity. It is quite evident that we must prepare ourselves for great
convulsions in the money market, not occasioned by speculation or any of the old
causes which have been alleged, but by a new cause with which we are not sufficiently
acquainted.</p></div>

<p>And again in March, 1879, when the effects of the decreasing volume
of money were making themselves more and more felt, Mr. Disraeli,
then Lord Beaconsfield, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>All this time the produce of the gold mines of Australia and California has been
regularly diminishing, and the consequence is that, while these great alterations
on the continent in favor of a gold currency have been made, notwithstanding that
increase of population which alone requires a considerable increase of currency to
carry on its transactions, the amount of the currency itself is yearly diminishing,
until a state of affairs has been brought about by gold production exactly the reverse
of that which it produced at first. Gold is every day appreciating in value,
and as it appreciates the lower become prices. It is not impossible that, as affairs
develop, the country may require that some formal investigation should be made
of the causes which are affecting the value of the precious metals, and the effect
which the change in the value of the precious metals has upon the industries of
the country, and upon the continual fall of prices.</p></div>

<p>In reaching their conclusions, Bismarck and others ignored the
fundamental principle that a gold supply that might be sufficient
for one country with a gold standard, and might even result in a
measure of prosperity to that country, would be wholly insufficient
if other countries should adopt the same standard and should enter
upon a keen competition and rivalry for the acquisition of gold.</p>

<p>The adoption of that standard by Germany and France was therefore
not only destructive of their own prosperity, but was a stunning
blow at the prosperity of England and all other gold-using
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p026" id="Page_p026">[26]</a></span>countries. In taking England for his model, Bismarck had not the
condition of the toiling masses before his mind, but the glamour of
prosperity which surrounded the creditor-barons.</p>

<p>The unprejudiced observer can not fail to perceive that the $370,000,000
coined under the Limited Coinage Act of the United States
of 1878, supplementing the gold stock of the western world, postponed
great industrial and financial crises. But the elements of
these crises are gathering, and, unless relief be soon forthcoming,
will burst upon the world with crushing severity.</p>


<p class="caption">DEMONETIZATION IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>If we are surprised that the sordid selfishness of the privileged
classes of Europe should have induced them to perpetrate so gross an
act of injustice, we are reminded that the legislation of monarchical
countries has usually been controlled in the interest of the privileged
classes. But what shall be said in defense of the demonetization of
silver by the United States? No such stupendous act of folly and
injustice was ever before perpetrated by the representatives of a
free people.</p>

<p>Our position differed materially from that of Great Britain. This
was not a creditor nation. Our people did not, and do not, own thousands
of millions of dollars of foreign bonds, on which to receive semi-annual
interest in a constantly appreciating money, which would
have to be paid from the current earnings of foreign labor. Instead,
therefore, of our demonetization unjustly enriching our creditor-classes
at the expense of foreigners, it enabled the creditors at home
here to rob and despoil the debtors among their own countrymen.
Instead of despoiling the Canadian, the Australian, the East Indian,
the Egyptian, or the Turk, the spoliation arranged for by our adoption
of the gold standard was a spoliation of the debtors in our own
communities. In so far, however, as our debt was held abroad, it
provided for a spoliation of our citizens by the foreign bondholders
also. And as nearly all our public debt was so held, we had presented
to us in 1873 the extraordinary spectacle of representatives,
sent here to enact laws for the welfare and advancement of our own
people, devoting all their energies, whether aware of it or not, to
the upbuilding of the fortunes of the moneyed aristocracies of other
countries, at the expense of the producers of the United States.</p>


<p class="caption">CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY AT THE TIME.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment the condition of this country at the time
when this amazing piece of legislation was enacted.</p>

<p>The Republic was but just recovering from an exhausting war,
which loaded it with a national debt approaching $3,000,000,000.
There were also State, county, city, and town debts aggregating
many more thousands of millions, with railroad and other corporate
bonds and debts aggregating yet other thousands of millions and
private debts of indefinite and unascertainable amount, represented
largely by mortgages on real estate. This constituted an aggregate
whose burden might naturally be presumed to be sufficient to tax
all the resources of the people. Although some portion of those
debts has been liquidated and the national bonds have been refunded
at lower rates of interest, yet we all know that in this age all municipal
and corporate debts, if not national debts, are practically perpetual.
No sooner is one form of bond liquidated than another takes
its place; no sooner is one public improvement completed than another
is begun.</p>

<p>At the time silver was demonetized it might well have been sup<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p027" id="Page_p027">[27]</a></span>posed
that a sufficiently large unearned increment had already been
realized by the foreign and domestic holders of United States bonds.
The greater portion of the debt of the Government was, when incurred,
made payable simply in "lawful money"&mdash;the interest alone
being payable in coin. Yet in March, 1869, the bond-holders secured
the passage of an act of Congress, entitled "An act to strengthen the
public credit," containing a pledge to pay in coin or its equivalent
not merely the interest, but the principal of all national obligations
not specially provided to be paid otherwise.</p>


<p class="caption">THE COURSE OF THE CREDITORS.</p>

<p>And again, when in 1870 Congress was about to provide for a refunding
of the public debt, these clamorous creditors, not satisfied
with having got the bonds at rates much below their face value, and
not satisfied with the pledge to pay in coin&mdash;a pledge made long
after the contract was made and the debt incurred&mdash;insisted that
not only should the new bonds be payable in coin, but in order to
guard against any possible interpretation which might work to their
detriment they did what has rarely been done in the history of monetary
legislation, insisted that even the very <i>standard</i> of that coin
should be fixed and nominated in the bond. They were willing to take
no chances. They were not willing to place confidence in the sense
of equity and fair dealing of the people of the United States. They
held before Congress the covert threat that if the new issue of bonds
did not provide for payment in "coin," instead of "lawful money,"
and did not prescribe the precise standard of coin in which they
were to be payable, it would be difficult if not impossible to place
the bonds on the market.</p>

<p>So, by the refunding act of July 14, 1870, Congress provided for
the payment in "coin of the present standard value," that is to say,
in either gold dollars of 25.8 grains of gold, nine-tenths fine, or in
silver dollars of 412&frac12; grains of silver, nine-tenths fine, at the option
of the United States. But even this extreme advantage to the creditors
over payment in "lawful money" of the United States, in which
the bonds were bought, and in which they were legally payable, was
insufficient. All but the most ingenious would imagine that having
thus provided for payment in coin then bearing a considerable premium
over the current money of the Republic, and having the very
standard of that coin fixed in the act, the highest point of vantage
had been reached. One device, however, and only one, remained by
which the money of the payment could be still further increased in
value, and this device did not escape the watchful eye or cunning
hand of the public creditors.</p>

<p>They clearly saw that if by legislative enactment they could secure
the rejection of one of the money-metals they would succeed
in enormously increasing the value of the metal retained. This they
accomplished by the demonetization of silver, and thus by striking
down one-half the automatic money of the world and devolving the
money function exclusively on the other half, added thousands of
millions of dollars to the burden of the debt.</p>


<p class="caption">THE PRETENSE TO "STRENGTHEN THE PUBLIC CREDIT."</p>

<p>It will be observed that this anxiety to strengthen the public
credit was evinced by the bondholders <i>after</i> and not before the
bonds were in their possession. No anxiety for the public credit
was manifested by them at a time when the Government might be
able to reap advantage from it. The Government having parted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p028" id="Page_p028">[28]</a></span>
with the bonds at a heavy discount, their selling price in the market
became a matter of no direct pecuniary importance to the people of
the United States.</p>

<p>The "strengthening of the public credit" that was to be effected
by the act of March 16, 1869, consisted of a rise in the price of the
bonds for the benefit of the holder, at a time when they were no
longer the property of the Government but of private individuals.
The real effect of the act, therefore, was not in any way to benefit
the Government but greatly to enrich, by an increment unearned
and unbargained for, a few men who had already been greatly enriched
by their dealings with the United States. The title of the
act should have read "An act to strengthen the bank account and
credit of the holders of United States bonds."</p>

<p>The excuse and apology for the act was that by its passage the refunding
process then contemplated, and afterward provided for by
the refunding act of 1870 might be rendered more certain of success;
but if any advantage accrued from that cause, it was lost, and much
more with it, by the increase which the act of 1869 effected in the
burden of the bonded obligation, by pledging the nation to a payment
in a medium much more valuable than the medium provided
for in the contract. And, again, in 1873 when all the bonds provided
for by the refunding act of 1870 had been sold and had passed out of
the hands of the Government, another act was passed, intended by the
money-lenders again to strengthen the public credit, and again to
the disadvantage of the people and to the exclusive and enormous
advantage of the bondholders. It bore the innocent title of "An
act revising and amending the laws relative to the mints, assay offices,
and coinage of the United States." This act, bearing on its face
no suggestion of any change more serious than that of regulating the
petty details of mint management, has proved to be an act of momentous
consequence to the people of this country. This is the act
that demonetized the silver dollar, which it did by merely omitting
that coin from the enumeration of the coins of the United States.</p>


<p class="caption">DEMONETIZATION WHOLLY UNJUSTIFIABLE.</p>

<p>Among all the explanations that have been made to account for
that demonetization by a Congress of the United States, I have
never heard any reason advanced which constituted a justification
for it. To my mind, in view of all the circumstances&mdash;in the face of
the herculean difficulties by which the nation was surrounded, in
the face of the sacrifices which our citizens had made to preserve
the Republic, and in the face of all that had already been done by an
over-generous people, proud of their national strength, and jealous
of their national honor, to satisfy the rapacious demands of the
money-lenders&mdash;in view, I say, of all these facts, the demonetization
of silver by the United States must be regarded as one of those historic
blunders that are worse than crimes. It was the child of Ignorance
and Avarice, and is already the prolific parent of enforced
idleness, poverty, and misery.</p>

<p>It is to undo as far as possible the effects of the blunder of 1873
that new legislation is now imperatively demanded by the people.
While the past can not be recalled, the present is ours, and the
pressing duty of to-day is to provide for the future. The demand
comes from all sections of the country that a remedy for the depressed
industrial conditions caused by the legislation of 1873, be
applied at the earliest moment. And what better remedy could
be applied than absolutely to reverse that legislation and to put the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p029" id="Page_p029">[29]</a></span>
monetary position of this country back to exactly where it was when
that wrong was committed?</p>

<p>Some twelve years ago an attempt was made to apply a remedy,
but the attempt was only partially successful. Instead of resulting
in free coinage, it resulted in the passage of the bill which authorized
the coinage of not less than two nor more than four million dollars'
worth of silver per month. On that occasion a financial debate
of great interest and importance was had in this Chamber and in the
other House of Congress. The proposition to remonetize silver or
to increase the silver coinage was vigorously opposed, but the arguments
then presented by the advocates of remonetization never have
been, and never can be, refuted.</p>

<p>In fact, but rarely has there been any attempt made to answer
those arguments. Puerile attempts at wit, and diatribes of abuse are
all that the silver men have heard in sixteen years in answer to the
contentions they have made in favor of the remonetization of silver.</p>


<p class="caption">EDUCATIONAL EFFECT OF DISCUSSION.</p>

<p>With that debate, Mr. President, long pending and eagerly maintained
on both sides, there began in this country an educational
movement among the masses, that is destined to have far-reaching
consequence. The public attention was fastened, as it had never
been fastened before, on the subject of money, and on the forces
which govern its value, and up to this time that attention has never
flagged. As a result we find the great body of our people to-day&mdash;the
farmers and artisans of the country&mdash;after years of reflection and discussion
in their lyceums and trade organizations, adopting to a large
extent the views then presented by the advocates of an increased
money volume&mdash;views which at the time were contemptuously derided
by the advocates of contraction and of gold.</p>

<p>The cry for relief appropriately now comes from the farmers, the
artisans, and the laboring classes, as well as from the young, the
enterprising, the thoughtful, of all classes, who have not inherited
wealth, but are hewing out for themselves the rugged path to success.
It is they who have had to bear the exactions of the system
which has prevailed. It is from the proceeds of their labor that the
extortions have been paid. If objection be made that the character
of relief proposed is not indorsed in financial circles, or by the literary
guild or professional political economists that surround them,
the sufficient reply is that the world can not wait for the correction
of abuses by those who are profiting by them. In the nature of
things, all movements for reform must be initiated by those who
can not lose by the installation of justice.</p>

<p>But there are others besides the laboring masses who are working
in the cause of humanity. There are noble, unselfish, and altruistic
men in all the countries of civilization, who see the wrong and are
indefatigable in their efforts to set it right.</p>

<p>I will read a cable dispatch recently addressed to me by Mr. Henry
H. Gibbs, formerly governor of the Bank of England, and now president
of the Bimetallic League of Great Britain:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>May</i> 6.&mdash;The friends of silver deeply regret the death of Senator Beck,
whose services in the cause of monetary reform are warmly appreciated on
this side of the Atlantic. The bimetallist party of the United Kingdom, now
including over one hundred members of the House of Commons, attach the greatest
value to the debate about to commence in your illustrious chamber. We fully
recognize not only that the support afforded to silver by your legislation during
the last twelve years has helped the protect the industrial world from an acute monetary
crisis, but also that the debates in Congress have served more than all else
to educate our people to recognition of the important issues involved. We believe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p030" id="Page_p030">[30]</a></span>
also that the increase and coinage of silver contemplated by Congress will restore,
wholly or considerably, your coinage rates, and will thus make international settlement
of this complex question comparatively easy. We anticipate further and
with much confidence, that the advance in the price of silver which must follow
your action will stimulate both the export and the other trades of your country,
and, while tending to the prosperity of your agricultural classes, will also assist
the manufacturing industries of the United Kingdom and the whole body of our
wage-earners.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Moreton Frewen, of London, an able writer on economic
subjects, whose recent work on the "The Economic Crisis" I commend
to the careful perusal of Senators, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It may, indeed, be affirmed, without fear of contradiction, that legislation arranged
in the interest of a certain class, first by Lord Liverpool in this country,
and again by Sir Robert Peel at the instigation of Mr. Jones Loyd and other wealthy
bankers, which was supplemented recently by simultaneous anti-silver legislation
in Berlin and Washington at the instance of the great financial houses&mdash;this
legislation has about doubled the burden of all national debts by an artificial
enhancement of the value of money.</p>

<p>The fall of all prices induced by this cause has been on such a scale that while
in twenty years the National debt of the United States quoted in dollars has been
reduced by nearly two-thirds, yet the value of the remaining one-third, measured
in wheat, in bar iron, or bales of cotton, is considerably greater&mdash;is a greater
demand draft on the labor and industry of the nation than was the whole debt at
the time it was contracted. The aggravation of the burdens of taxation induced
by this so-called "appreciation of gold," which is no natural appreciation, but has
been brought about by class legislation to increase the value of the gold which is
in a few hands, requires but to be explained to an enfranchised democracy,
which will know how to protect itself against further attempts to contract the
currency and to force down prices to the confusion of every existing contract.</p>

<p>Of all classes of middle-men, bankers have been by far the most successful in
intercepting and appropriating an undue share of produced wealth. While the
modern system of banking and credit may be said to be even yet in its infancy,
that portion of the assets of the community which is to-day in the strong boxes
of the bankers would, if declared, be an astounding revelation of the recent
profits of this particular business; and not only has the business itself become a
most profitable monopoly, but its interests in a very few hands are diametrically
opposed to the general interests of the majority. By legislation intended to contract
the currency and force down all prices, including wages, the price paid for
labor, the money owner has been able to increase the purchase power of his sovereign
or dollar by the direct diminution of the price of every kind of property
measured in money.</p></div>


<p class="caption">UNFULFILLED PROPHECIES.</p>

<p>During the debate on the limited coinage bill, not content with
abuse of the advocates of the measure; with flimsy criticism of it
and specious arguments against it, its opponents in and out of Congress
indulged in diverse prophecies and predictions. They pictured
forth the lamentable results that would follow its passage, and the
direful consequences that would ensue from an increase of the circulating
medium of the country. Among the results confidently predicted
were the following: that the silver would not circulate at
all, and again that it would circulate to the exclusion of gold, which
metal, we were informed, would flow out of this country with a velocity
and in a volume theretofore unknown; that we should be unable
to redeem our paper money in gold; that we should be precipitated
into a silver vortex; that an inflation of the currency would follow,
which would ruinously raise prices of all commodities and that this
inflation would result in an unprecedented contraction. We were
charged with forcing upon the public creditors a dollar worth only
ninety cents. We were warned that the passage of the bill would
indefinitely postpone the refunding of the public debt, and would
lower the price and impair the value of our national securities. It
was charged that we were setting on foot a new and irrepressible
conflict between two great sections of the country&mdash;the East and
the West. We were charged with uttering a debased coin; with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p031" id="Page_p031">[31]</a></span>
lowering the standard of American credit; with tarnishing the
integrity and honor of our country before foreign nations, and with
unprecedented moral turpitude in setting an example of flagrant and
shameless national dishonesty.</p>

<p>The men of the far West, and of the Pacific slope especially, were
the particular targets of this abuse. They were denounced by some
as "lunatics," by others as dangerous and unworthy demagogues, because,
as was charged, their constituents, if not themselves, were directly
interested in the restoration of the ancient right of silver to full
recognition as one of the money metals. For their benefit resort was
had to every epithet which the English language afforded. In
holding them up to public scorn the rich and varied vocabulary of
odium and opprobrium was exhausted.</p>

<p>These prophecies of disaster were united in by the professors of political
economy in all the Eastern colleges, by the President of the
United States, by the Secretary of the Treasury, by the leading American
newspapers, by the principal public men and journals of Great
Britain, if not of all Europe; and, of course, by all bankers, money-lenders,
and professional financiers the world over.</p>

<p>And now, Mr. President, how many of all those alarming prognostications
by all these distinguished prophets have been fulfilled?
Not one! On the contrary, it is not too much to say that the public
credit of the United States is to-day the highest in the world. It
does not stand merely in line with that of other first-rate powers;
it stands at the head. Our gold, silver, and paper money stand at
a parity with each other. If a full measure of relief was not realized
by the passage of that bill it is because the coinage of $4,000,000 a
month was left optional with the Secretary of the Treasury, instead
of being made mandatory on him.</p>

<p>But it is hardly necessary to assert that the predicted inflation of
prices has not been observed as a consequence of the coinage of $2,000,000
a month. While the issuance of that amount has not, with our
rapidly increasing population and wealth, been sufficient to arrest
the downward tendency of prices, it has undoubtedly prevented them
from falling much lower. Without that coinage, we should have had
industrial depression, chronic and somber, with consequences of untold
disaster.</p>

<p>But the result which gave most apprehension to those who advocated
the gold standard, the evil which they regarded as on the whole
the most threatening and direful of all the evils that were to result
from even so small an increase in the money volume as that bill provided
for, was the outflow of gold. They ridiculously under-estimated
the tremendous money-absorbing power of this great country.
And as if to emphasize to all the world the complete absurdity of
their alleged fears&mdash;this apprehension has been conspicuously and notoriously
set at naught by the constant inflow of gold. On the 30th
of June, 1878, the amount of gold coin and bullion in the Treasury
and in monetary circulation in this country is officially reported to
have been $213,199,977, and this amount is probably much over-estimated.
On November 1, 1889, we had more than three times as
much&mdash;the amount of gold in circulation and in the Treasury being
reported as $689,000,000.</p>

<p>"Experience," says Dr. Johnson, "is the great test of truth, and
is perpetually contradicting the theories of men," and the last experience,
Mr. President, is the best.</p>

<p>If the professors of political economy, the Eastern newspaper editors,
and the professional financiers were then so seriously mistaken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p032" id="Page_p032">[32]</a></span>
ought they not to be a little modest now in making predictions, especially
in renewing predictions that have been already discredited?
They can not point to a single instance in which their prophesy has
not been falsified by the event. So humiliating a failure on the part
of the professors, in a realm of which they boastfully claimed to be
masters, so complete an overthrow of these "experts" by men who
were ridiculed and derided as rural financiers and crazy theorists,
ought to put the advocates of the gold standard on their guard
against a like defeat on this occasion. They are pressed for reasons
to account for the utter miscarriage of their prophecies. They are
left without a shadow of consolation except that the coinage of
$2,000,000 worth of silver bullion each month has not succeeded in
placing silver at a par with gold. They affect to believe that the
advocates of silver in 1878 expected that that metal, under the very
limited demand of $2,000,000 a month, would be brought to a level
with gold, which, owing to the demonetization of silver, had risen
abnormally and ruinously in value.</p>

<p>No such belief was ever entertained or expressed. On the contrary
it was repeatedly asserted by the advocates of silver that so long
as the entire yield of gold from all the mines of the world (in 1878,
$119,000,000) was invested with the full money function and had free
access to all mints to be transmuted into coin, it could not be expected
that the conferring of the legal-tender function upon a sum so comparatively
trifling as one-fourth the yield of silver (the yield in 1878
being $99,000,000) would have the effect of placing it on a level with
gold.</p>

<p>It is, however, a significant fact that every silver dollar that has
been coined under that act is at a parity with gold, and will to-day
buy as much of all the objects of human desire as will the gold dollar.
Nay, more, silver bullion&mdash;disparaged and discredited as it is by being
shorn of the money function, and denied access to the mints, instead
of decreasing in purchasing power, has maintained so steady a relation
to commodities that 412&frac12; grains of uncoined silver will exchange
for as much to-day as would the coined dollar, whether of silver or
gold, in 1873, when the full money function attached equally to both
metals. If this be true&mdash;and I shall presently demonstrate it beyond
refutation&mdash;what an utter perversion of terms it is to say that silver
has fallen in value!</p>


<p class="caption">WILL REMONETIZATION PLACE US ALONGSIDE INDIA.</p>

<p>We are solemnly warned that the full remonetization of silver in the
United States would place us alongside India and the other barbarous
countries of the world. This brilliant piece of reasoning is advanced
with great confidence, and is intended to be conclusive of the argument
against silver. But, Mr. President, India is no more barbarous
now than it was in 1873&mdash;before our silver dollar was demonetized.
India is no more barbarous now than it was in 1857, when Germany
demonetized gold and placed herself "alongside" India. Neither is
Germany any more civilized now than then. We did not at that
time hear any complaint, either in the United States or Europe,
that the use of silver as money placed any one nation more than any
other in dangerous affiliation with the civilization of India. We
have never heard it charged against France that its civilization was
brought any nearer that of India by the immense quantity of silver
money in France. Neither did we hear it charged against the United
States up to 1873 that we were "alongside," or dangerously close to
the barbarous nations by our use of silver as money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p033" id="Page_p033">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to 1834 we had no metallic money other than silver in our circulation,
and up to 1850 we had much more silver in circulation
than gold. Were we "alongside" India then? Where were the wise
and patriotic men of our country at those periods? History fails to
record any protest on their part that we were placing ourselves
"alongside" India or any other of the barbarous nations of the world
by our use of silver and our recognition of its full money power. All
the nations of the earth used silver and accorded it full recognition
as money equally with gold up to 1819. Was all Christendom at
that time "alongside" India? When, in that year, Great Britain
sundered the silver link that from time immemorial had kept her
"alongside" India and the other barbarous nations and, for selfish
reasons of her own, arising from her position as a creditor of all
other nations, decided to recognize gold only as money, was any
evidence afforded of a sudden advance in the civilization of Great
Britain? Was the emergence of that nation from the benumbing
companionship of India and the other barbaric countries into the
glittering and refulgent light of the gold dispensation signalized, as
would be expected, by a corresponding improvement in the condition
of the people?</p>

<p>On the contrary, the history of the time informs us that as a consequence
of the passage of the bill by Parliament in 1819, compelling
payments in gold, prices rapidly fell, cotton in particular sinking
in the short space of three months to one-half its former level. Within
six months all prices had fallen one-half, and showed no signs of
improvement for the next three years. By reason of the contraction
of the currency the industry of the nation was congealed, as is a
flowing stream by the severity of an arctic winter. Alarm became
universal; confidence and activity ceased. Bankruptcies increased
in 1819 more than 50 per cent. over the number of the previous year.
Meetings were held throughout England in which the people called
on the government to devise some means of redressing the situation.
So universal was the distress that the owners of land in England,
who in 1819 numbered 160,000 were in seven years, by forced sales
and foreclosure of mortgages on the smaller farms, reduced to 30,000,
and one in every seven of the population lived on organized charity.
All this was but a part of the price which the people of England paid
for a policy imposed on them by the creditor classes among their own
number. The condition of industry and disorganization of labor led
to frequent and serious conflicts between the people and the military.
They also led to commercial crises without number, and England,
by demonetizing silver and thus ceasing to be "alongside"
India, became the seat of panics, as Egypt had long been of the
plague and India of the cholera.</p>

<p>As a contrast to this I will merely cite the change in the condition
of India within the past seventeen years. When the Western world
discarded silver as money and, as a consequence, India received a
larger supply of it than ever before, that barbarous nation, as is universally
admitted, made progress by leaps and bounds. No country
on earth has in the same time made such advances in material prosperity
and in all the elements that conduce to the comfort and happiness
of a people. Notwithstanding the alleged debasement of
silver, no sooner had its increased inflow into India begun than the
industries of a vast continent were established and set in motion,
and a substantial part of the activity and prosperity that were wont
to pervade some of the industries of the United States has, by that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p034" id="Page_p034">[34]</a></span>
demonetization, been transferred to fields of wheat, and fields and
factories of cotton 10,000 miles distant.</p>

<p>What really placed us alongside such barbarous countries as India
was the demonetization of silver. It was by that demonetization
that the people of Europe were enabled, with gold, to buy silver at
30 per cent. discount, which, when shipped to India and coined into
rupees, would buy as much wheat as could ever have been bought
with that coin. There has been no decrease whatever in the purchasing
power of the rupee in India. This was equivalent to buying
wheat at 30 per cent. below the price theretofore paid for it, and
thus the farmers of the United States were by demonetization placed
"alongside" the barbarous people of India. Their wheat had to
compete in the European markets with the wheat of India, and it
is this competition that placed them "alongside" India. The farmer
of this country, therefore, by demonetization of silver, was compelled
to compete with under-paid and half-starved ryots. And so it was
that our cotton planters, by the demonetization of silver, were
placed alongside the barbarous people of India. It is this degrading
competition that places a highly civilized people alongside a barbarous
one.</p>

<p>The advocates of the single gold standard deem even silver money
much better money than greenbacks. Does it then follow that when
greenbacks were our only money&mdash;good enough money to carry the
nation through the greatest war in all history&mdash;we were "alongside"
or underneath the barbarous nations of the world? It is not the
form, or the material of a nation's money that fixes its status relatively
to other nations. That is accomplished by the vitality, the energy,
the intellectuality and effective force of its people. The United
States can never be placed "alongside" any barbarous nation, except
by compelling our people to compete with barbarous peoples&mdash;compelling
them to sell the products of American labor at prices regulated
by the cost of labor and manner of living in barbarous countries.
As well might it be said that we are alongside the barbarous
people of India because we continue to produce wheat and cotton.</p>

<p>The distinguishing feature of all barbarous nations is the squalor
of their working classes. The reward of their hard toil is barely
enough to maintain animal existence. A civilized people are placed
alongside a barbarous one when, in their means of livelihood, the
foundation of their civilization, they are made to compete with the
barbarians. That was the result accomplished for the farmers and
planters of the United States when silver was demonetized.</p>


<p class="caption">CREDITORS AND DEBTORS.&mdash;A COMPARISON OF MOTIVES.</p>

<p>All movements for the increase of the monetary circulation are
ascribed by the money-lenders and creditor classes to the unworthy
desire on the part of the debtors to escape their just obligations.
But if motives are to be brought in question, the rule should work
both ways. No note is taken of the motive of the creditor classes in
securing a contraction of the circulation. Whatever the apparent
purpose of contraction, and however specious the arguments advanced
in its justification, the real object has always been to increase
the purchasing power of money. In all countries, and throughout all
time, it is the cupidity of the creditor classes and annuitants, and
their desire to increase the value of the money unit that has brought
about a shrinkage in the money volume. Unlike the great masses of
the people, who were ignorant of the effects to be naturally expected
from such a shrinkage, the annuitants and moneyed men very well
understood that the value of every pound or dollar depended on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p035" id="Page_p035">[35]</a></span>
number of pounds or dollars that were in circulation; the larger
the total number out, the smaller the purchasing power of each; the
smaller the total number out, the greater the purchasing power of
each.</p>

<p>Loaners of capital are not usually those who entertain further hope
of personal achievement. When men realize fortunes it is rarely that
they conserve the faculty of initiative; they find no special delight
in novelty; they look so carefully to security in the use of money that
the spirit of adventure is restrained. The realization of a fortune is
usually the labor of a life-time, and few men who reach the goal care
to retrace their steps to enter again upon a struggle that demands all
the strength, the momentum, and the intrepidity of youth. Men of
assured incomes therefore are disposed to take their ease, and society
must look, for its material progress and development, to those who
have a career to make, with the ambition and the power to make it.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable circumstance, Mr. President, that throughout the
entire range of economic discussion in gold-standard circles, it seems
to be taken for granted that a change in the value of the money
unit is a matter of no significance, and imports no mischief to society,
so long as the change is in one direction. Who has ever
heard from an Eastern journal any complaint against a contraction
of our money volume; any admonition that in a shrinking volume
of money lurk evils of the utmost magnitude? On the other hand
we have been treated to lengthy homilies on the evils of "inflation,"
whenever the slightest prospect presented itself of a decrease in the
value of money&mdash;not with the view of giving the debtor an advantage
over the lender of money, but of preventing the unconscionable
injustice of a further increasing value in the dollars
which the debtor contracted to pay. Loud and resounding protests
have been entered against the "dishonesty" of making payments
in "depreciated dollars." The debtors are characterized as
dishonest for desiring to keep money at a steady and unwavering
value. If that object could be secured, it would undoubtedly be
to the interest of the debtor, and could not possibly work any injustice
to the creditor. It would simply assure to both debtor and
creditor the exact measure for which they bargained. It would enable
the debtor to pay his debt with exactly the amount of sacrifice
to which, on the making of the debt, he undertook to submit, in
order to pay it.</p>


<p class="caption">WHO ARE THE DEBTORS?</p>

<p>In all discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside
the equities involved by sneering at the debtors. But, Mr. President,
debt is the distinguishing characteristic of modern society. It is
through debt that the marvelous developments of nineteenth century
civilization have been effected. Who are the debtors in this
country? Who are the borrowers of money? The men of enterprise,
of energy, of skill, the men of industry, of foresight, of calculation,
of daring. In the ranks of the debtors will be found a large
preponderance of the constructive energy of every country. The
debtors are the upbuilders of the national wealth and prosperity;
they are the men of initiative, the men who conceive plans and set
on foot enterprises. They are those who by borrowing money enrich
the community. They are the dynamic force among the people.
They are the busy, restless, moving throng whom you find in all
walks of life in this country&mdash;the active, the vigorous, the strong,
the undaunted.</p>

<p>These men are sustained in their efforts by the hope and belief that
their labors will be crowned with success. Destroy that hope and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p036" id="Page_p036">[36]</a></span>
you take away from society the most powerful of all the incentives to
material development; you place in the pathway of progress an obstacle
which it is impossible to surmount.</p>

<p>The men of whom I have spoken are undoubtedly the first who are
likely to be affected by a shrinkage in the volume of money.</p>

<p>The highest prosperity of a nation is attained only when all its
people are employed in avocations suited to their individual aptitudes,
and when a just money system insures an equitable distribution
of the products of their industry. With our present complex
civilization, in order that men may have constant employment, it is
indispensable that work be planned and undertakings projected
years in advance. Without an intelligent forecast of enterprises
large numbers of workmen must periodically be relegated to idleness.
Enterprises that take years to complete must be contracted
for in advance, and payments provided for.</p>

<p>A constant but unperceived rise in the value of the dollar with
which those payments must be made, baffles all plans, thwarts all
calculation, and destroys all equities between debtor and creditor.
If we can not intelligently regulate our money volume so as to
maintain unchanging the value of the money unit, if we can not
preserve our people from the blighting effects which an increase in
the measuring power of the money unit entails upon all industry, to
what purpose is our boasted civilization?</p>

<p>By the increase of that measuring power all hopes are disappointed,
all purposes baffled, all efforts thwarted, all calculations
defied. This subtle enlargement in the measuring power of the
unit of money (the dollar) affects every class of the working community.
Like a poisonous drug in the human body, it permeates
every vein, every artery, every fiber and filament of the industrial
structure. The debtor is fighting for his life against an enemy he
does not see, against an influence he does not understand. For,
while his calculations were well and intelligently made, and the
amount of his debts and the terms of his contracts remain the same,
the weight of all his obligations has been increased by an insidious
increase in the value of the money unit.</p>


<p class="caption">EFFECTS OF A SHRINKING VOLUME OF MONEY.</p>

<p>As to the benumbing consequences following a shrinkage in the
volume of money, the testimony of history is briefly reviewed in the
report of the Monetary Commission to which I have already referred,
and from which I read the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>At the Christian era the metallic money of the Roman Empire amounted to
$1,800,000,000. By the end of the fifteenth century it had shrunk to less than
$200,000,000. During this period a most extraordinary and baleful change took
place in the condition of the world. Population dwindled and commerce, arts,
wealth, and freedom all disappeared. The people were reduced by poverty and
misery to the most degraded conditions of serfdom and slavery. The disintegration
of society was almost complete. The conditions of life were so hard that
individual selfishness was the only thing consistent with the instinct of self-preservation.
All public spirit, all generous emotions, all the noble aspirations of
man shriveled and disappeared as the volume of money shrunk and as prices
fell.</p>

<p>History records no such disastrous transition as that from the Roman Empire
to the Dark Ages. Various explanations have been given of this entire breaking
down of the frame-work of society, but it was certainly coincident with a shrinkage
in the volume of money, which was also without historical parallel. The
crumbling of institutions kept even step and pace with the shrinkage in the stock
of money and the falling of prices. All other attendant circumstances than these
last have occurred in other historical periods unaccompanied and unfollowed by
any such mighty disasters. It is a suggestive coincidence that the first glimmer
of light only came with the invention of bills of exchange and paper substitutes,
through which the scanty stock of the precious metals was increased in efficiency.
But not less than the energizing influence of Potosi and all the argosies of
treas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p037" id="Page_p037">[37]</a></span>ure from the New World were needed to arouse the Old World from its comatose
sleep, to quicken the torpid limbs of industry, and to plume the leaden wings of
commerce. It needed the heroic treatment of rising prices to enable society to
reunite its shattered links, to shake off the shackles of feudalism, to relight and
uplift the almost extinguished torch of civilization. That the disasters of the
Dark Ages were caused by decreasing money and falling prices, and that the recovery
therefrom and the comparative prosperity which followed the discovery
of America were due to an increasing supply of the precious metals and rising
prices, will not seem surprising or unreasonable when the noble functions of
money are considered. Money is the great instrument of association, the very
fiber of social organism, the vitalizing force of industry, the protoplasm of civilization,
and as essential to its existence as oxygen is to animal life. Without money
civilization could not have had a beginning; with a diminishing supply it must
languish, and, unless relieved, finally perish.</p>

<p>Symptoms of disasters similar to those which befell society during the Dark
Ages were observable on every hand during the first half of this century. In 1809
the revolutionary troubles between Spain and her American colonies broke out.
These troubles resulted in a great diminution in the production of the precious
metals, which was quickly indicated by a fall in general prices. As already stated
in this report, it is estimated that the purchasing power of the precious metals increased
between 1809 and 1848 fully 145 per cent., or, in other words, that the general
range of prices was 60 per cent. lower in 1848 than it was in 1809. During this
period there was no general demonetization of either metal and no important fluctuation
in the relative value of the metals, and the supply was sufficient to keep
their stock good against losses by accident and abrasion. But it was insufficient
to keep the stock up to the proper correspondence with the increasing demand of
advancing populations.</p>

<p>The world has rarely passed through a more gloomy period than this one. Again
do we find falling prices and misery and destitution inseparable companions. The
poverty and distress of the industrial masses were intense and universal, and, since
the discovery of the mines of America, without a parallel. In England the suffering
of the people found expression in demands upon Parliament for relief, in
bread riots, and in immense Chartist demonstrations. The military arm of the
nation had to be strengthened to prevent the all-pervading discontent from ripening
into open revolt. On the Continent the fires of revolution smoldered everywhere,
and blazed out at many points, threatening the overthrow of states and
the subversion of social institutions.</p>

<p>Whenever and wherever the mutterings of discontent were hushed by the fear
of increased standing armies, the foundations of society were honey-combed by
powerful secret political associations. The cause at work to produce this state
of things was so subtle, and its advance so silent, that the masses were entirely
ignorant of its nature. They had come to regard money as an institution fixed
and immovable in value, and when the price of property and the wages of labor
fell, they charged the fault, not to the money, but to the property and the employer.
They were taught that the mischief was the result of overproduction.
Never having observed that overproduction was complained of only when the
money stock was decreasing, their prejudices were aroused against labor-saving
machinery. They were angered at capital, because it either declined altogether
to embark in industrial enterprises or would only embark in them upon the condition
of employing labor at the most scanty remuneration. They forgot that
falling prices compelled capital to avoid such enterprises on any other condition,
and for the most part to avoid them entirely. They did not comprehend that
money in shrinking volume was the prolific parent of enforced idleness and poverty,
and that falling prices divorced money capital, from labor, but they none the
less felt the paralyzing pressure of the shrinking metallic shroud that was closing
around industry.</p>

<p>The increased yield of the Russian gold fields in 1846 gave some relief and served
as a parachute to the fall in prices, which might otherwise have resulted in a great
catastrophe. But the enormous metallic supplies of California and Australia
were all needed to give substantial and adequate relief. Great as these supplies
were, their influence in raising prices was moderate and soon entirely arrested by
the increasing populations and commerce which followed them. In the twenty-five
years between 1850 and 1876 the money stock of the world was more than
doubled, and yet at no time during this period was the general level of prices
raised more than 18 per cent. above the general level of 1848.</p>

<p>A comparison of this effect of an increasing volume of money after 1848 with
the effect of a decreasing volume between 1809 and 1848 strikingly illustrates how
largely different in degree is the influence upon prices of an increasing or decreasing
volume of money. The decrease of the yield of the mines since about 1865,
while population and commerce have been advancing, has already produced unmistakable
symptoms of the same general distrust, non-employment of labor, and
political and social disquiet, which have characterized all former periods of shrinking
money.</p></div>

<p class="caption">THE FALL OF PRICES SINCE 1873.</p>

<p>It is a fact not disputed anywhere but universally admitted, that
for many years past the prices of all articles entering into general
consumption among the people have been steadily falling. It is
obvious that the industrial conditions prevailing since 1873 are but
a repetition of those above described as following 1809&mdash;with falling
prices, constant unrest, and universal discontent.</p>

<p>The following table, compiled from figures published by the Bureau
of Statistics of the Treasury Department, shows the average
range of export prices of the articles named for each year since 1873:</p>

<p>To show from another source the same general fact of the decline
of prices, I quote from an article published in the New York Tribune
early in 1886.</p>

<p>The New York Tribune is pretty good authority. These figures
are undoubtedly from the calculations and from the pen of Mr.
Grosvenor, of the editorial staff of that able journal, formerly editor
and proprietor of the "Public," whose estimates of prices have, in my
judgment, been more correctly made than those of any other statistician
in the world. The article is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Quotations of about two hundred articles are compared since 1860, and the
amount of money is ascertained which would purchase, at different dates, of these
various articles, quantities corresponding as closely as possible to their ascertained
consumption in 1880, the date of the last census. Among the articles compared
are wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, beans and pease, mess pork, bacon, ham, live
hogs, lard, fresh beef, tallow, live sheep, poultry, butter, cheese, eggs, milk, hay,
potatoes, turnips, cabbage, onions, apples, raisins, sugar, brown and crushed; molasses,
coffee, tea, tobacco, whisky, malt and hops, mackerel, codfish, salt, rice,
nutmegs, cloves, pepper, cotton, print-cloths and standard sheeting, wool of different
qualities, blankets, carpets, flannels, leather, boots, shoes, hides, silk, India rubber,
iron (pig and bar), nails, steel rails, coal, oil (crude and refined), tin and tin
plates, copper, lead, hemp, lumber, spruce and pine, oak, ash, walnut, and white
wood, lath, brick, lime, turpentine, linseed oil, soap, glass, paper, white lead, and
twelve other kinds of paints, fertilizers, and over fifty kinds of drugs and chemicals.</p>

<p>It is not only clear from this comparison that the prices of 1885 have been the
lowest in our history for twenty-five years, but that there has been a general tendency
toward lower prices. From 1866 to 1871, and again from 1872 until 1885, prices
fell quite steadily. Indeed, had not the short crop of 1881 caused a temporary advance
in the spring of 1882, the range of January, 1880, would have been the highest
of the later period, and it might have been said that the present era of declining
prices had continued with little intermission for six years. None will fail to
observe how swift and sharp the advances have been&mdash;about 12 per cent. from
November, 1871, to May, 1872, and 25&frac12; per cent. from October, 1878, to January, 1880.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p040" id="Page_p040">[40]</a></span>
But these spasmodic advances, by which the general tendency downward is interrupted,
only serve to make it more clear that prices have been tending irresistibly
toward a lower level than that of 1860, not only during the period of paper depreciation,
but since gold has been the measure of value.</p></div>

<p>In order to show that the United States are not alone in their complaint
of falling prices, but that the complaint is universal, and in
order that we may have before us a broad view of the field of general
prices, I submit a table showing the relation to each other of the
range of prices from 1809 to 1849, by decades, based on the prices of
fifty leading articles of commerce, prepared by the distinguished
Professor Jevons and published in the London Economist for May
8, 1869.</p>

<p>Taking the range of prices of 1849 as a datum line (the range for
that year being the lowest of the century) Mr. Jevons works backward
to 1809, when the revolt of the South American colonies against
the authority of Spain shut off at a blow the supplies of the precious
metals, and set on foot a money famine from which the world knew
no relief till the discovery of the mines of California and Australia.</p>

<p>Professor Jevons's figures are as follows, the prices of 1849 being
represented by 100:</p>

<p>From these figures it will be observed that the fall from 1809 to 1849,
a period of forty years, was as 245 to 100, or 59 per cent.</p>

<p>By the next table which I submit, that of Dr. Soetbeer, it will be
seen that the general range of prices rose gradually from 1849 to
1873, in the last of which years the figures bore to those of 1849 the
relation of 138 to 100. It has never been denied that this rise was due
to the increase in the world's money supply by the yield of the precious
metals from the mines of California and Australia, the effects of
which, however, as will be seen by the table, were not felt on prices
till 1853&mdash;five years after John Marshall's discovery of the yellow
metal in the tail-race at Sutter's mills. Yet, because it interferes with
the pecuniary interests of a large and influential class, it is vehemently
denied that the fall of prices since 1873 is due to a decrease in
the volume of the money caused by the demonetization of silver in
that year throughout the western world.</p>

<p>From and after that year, as will be perceived by an examination of
the figures; in other words, from the year when one-half the world's
money supply was deprived of the money function, we find an almost
uninterrupted decline of prices. The figures of 1873 and 1885 will be
seen to bear to one another the relation of 138 to 108, or a fall of 22
per cent. in twelve years. Should the fall continue at that rate without
interruption&mdash;and there is no reason apparent why it should not,
we shall in forty years have witnessed a decline of 72 per cent. in
the general range of prices&mdash;a decline considerably greater than that
from 1809 to 1849. And these are not the figures of bimetallists or
silver "theorists," but of pronounced advocates of the single standard
of gold. Where, I would inquire, is the fall of prices to stop?</p>

<p>Dr. Soetbeer's table represents the general average price of one-hundred
leading articles of commerce each year for a period of nearly
forty years. He takes as a basis the general range of gold prices pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p041" id="Page_p041">[41]</a></span>vailing
between 1847 and 1850, and calling that range 100, shows the
relative standing toward it of the general range of prices for subsequent
years, up to 1885.</p>

<p>Mr. Sauerbeck, also an advocate of the gold standard, and whose
work has the approval of the Statistical Society, takes as a datum
line the prices ruling from 1867 to 1870. Rating those at 100 he
finds that by 1873 prices had risen to 111, by 1886 they had fallen to
69, and by September, 1887, to 68.7. He declares the average prices
for the first nine months of 1887 to have been the lowest reached for
a hundred years.</p>


<p class="caption">BOTH GOLD AND SILVER VARIABLE IN VALUE.</p>

<p>The fact that the metals have separated considerably since 1873,
and that silver bullion now sells at less than par value of $1.29 per
ounce, is taken to signify that silver has fallen&mdash;not that gold has
risen. This proceeds from the assumption that whenever a change
takes place in the relation between gold and any other article the
change must necessarily be in the other article. This assumption,
in turn, is based on the absurd idea that calling gold a "standard"
will insure it against change.</p>

<p>Among political economists it is a well-recognized principle that
neither gold or silver is exempt from the universal application of
the law of supply and demand. That law governs gold and silver,
not only as commodities, but as money, and governs as well all
other kinds of money that may be used. And while the advocate of
the single gold standard is at all times ready to concede the truth of
this assertion as to silver, he is confident that it does not and can
not apply to gold; that the economic law which makes supply and
demand a regulator of value is suspended as to gold.</p>

<p>That a metallic money, whether of gold or silver, is very far from
being stable is admitted by innumerable authorities, of whom I will
cite only a few.</p>

<p>Dr. Adam Smith, in his "Wealth of Nations," book 1, chapter 5,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gold and silver, like every other commodity, vary in their value. The discovery
of the abundant mines of America reduced in the sixteenth century the
value of gold and silver in Europe to about a third of what it had been before.
This revolution in their value, though perhaps the greatest, is by no means the
only one of which history gives some account.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p042" id="Page_p042">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Increase the scarcity of gold to a certain degree and the smallest bit of it may
be more precious than a diamond.</p></div>

<p>John Locke, "Considerations, etc., in relation to money" (published
in 1691), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The greater scarcity of money enhances its price and increases the scramble;
there being nothing that does supply the want of it; the lessening of its quantity,
therefore, always increases its price and makes an equal portion of it exchange
for a greater of any other thing.</p></div>

<p>Prof. Francis A. Walker, "Money," etc., page 210, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gold and silver do, over long periods, undergo great changes of value and become
in a high degree deceptive as a measure of the obligation of the debtor of
the claim of the creditor. Thus Professor Jevons estimates that the value of
gold fell between 1789 and 1809, 46 per cent., that from 1809 to 1849 it rose 145 per
cent., while in twenty years after 1849 it fell again at least 20 per cent.</p></div>

<p>Jevons, "Money and Exchange," chapter 6, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In respect to steadiness of value the metals are probably less satisfactory, regarded
as a standard of value, than many other commodities, such as corn.</p></div>

<p>And again, in chapter 24 of the same work, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We are too much accustomed to look upon the value of gold as a fixed datum
line in commerce; but in reality it is a very variable thing.</p></div>

<p>Sir Archibald Alison (England, in 1815 and 1845), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The coining of gold and silver, which is universal in all civilised nations, and affixing
to them one definite and permanent value by authority of law, has no effect
whatever in preventing the fluctuations in the real value of the current coin of
the realm.</p></div>

<p>Professor Laughlin, of Harvard, in his work on Political Economy
(page 72), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is quite evident that the name dollar does not always have the same value,
although people often think it does. We get into the habit of using names without
thinking what they really mean. The 23.22 grains in a gold dollar may be exchanged
sometimes for more, sometimes for less, of other commodities. When it
is exchanged for less, its value has fallen relatively to all other commodities, and,
even if the name dollar remains the same, its value has fallen. One must then
offer more dollars than before for the same commodities. That is, when money
falls in value, prices rise; when money rises in value, prices fall.</p>

<p>Now, we shall say a few words in regard to another function, a means of paying
long contracts, or debts which run over a long term of years.</p>

<p>Suppose that I loaned you in 1880, $1,000 for twenty years. In that year the
$1,000 bought a certain quantity of corn, wheat, sugar, salt, wood, hats, and shoes.
In 1900, when you are to pay me back the $1,000 in money, if prices have changed,
you may give me back the same amount of money, but you will not return to me
the same purchasing power over other things. If for some reason prices have
fallen between 1880 and 1900, it will take less money to buy the same quantity as
before of corn, wheat, etc. If so, the $1,000 you return me in 1900 will be of more
value than the $1,000 I gave you, and it would be unjust to oblige you to give me
more than you borrowed. If, on the other hand, prices have risen, then the $1,000
in money would buy me less than before, so that I should lose. * * * Hence,
the value of money (gold or silver) does not remain the same for any length of
time; and the precious metals, while they are very satisfactory for exchanges
which do not take very long to complete, can not serve as a proper measure of
value during a long term or years.</p></div>

<p>Ricardo, the greatest authority on the gold standard, the financial
writer, more highly regarded throughout the world than any other
that has ever appeared in Great Britain, whose logical utterances
have never failed to attract the attention of mankind, stated the true
condition of things in 1810, and advocated the true policy for Great
Britain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p043" id="Page_p043">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>In his "Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency," Ricardo
makes the following statement, which I commend to the careful
attention of the advocates of the single gold standard:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>While a standard is used, we are subject to only such a variation in the value
of money as the standard itself is subject to; but against such variation there is
no possible remedy, and late events have proved that, during periods of war, when
gold and silver are used for the payment of large armies distant from home, those
variations are much more considerable than has been generally allowed. This
admission only proves that gold and silver are not so good a standard as they have
been hitherto supposed&mdash;that they are themselves subject to greater variations
than it is desirable a standard should be subject to. They are, however, the best
with which we acquainted.</p>

<p>If any other commodity less variable could be found, it might very properly be
adopted as the future standard of our money, provided it had all the other qualities
which fitted it for that purpose; but while these metals are the standard the
currency should conform in value to them, and whenever it does not, and the market
price of bullion is above the mint price, the currency is depreciated. This
proposition is unanswered and is unanswerable. Much inconvenience arises from
using two metals as a standard of our money; and it has long been a disputed
point whether gold or silver should by law be made the principal or sole standard
of money. In favor of gold it may be said, that its greater value under a small
bulk eminently qualifies for a standard in an opulent country.</p></div>

<p>And I may here remark that it requires an opulent country to
maintain the single gold standard, and the country does maintain it
at very great expense. I do not wonder that he thought an opulent
country, a creditor country, the only one that ought to adopt it, for
no other country can afford to adopt it. But, like many people who
in attempting to improve their condition in society attempt luxuries
and extravagances which they can not maintain and which force
them back into the ranks from which they came, so nations in attempting
to establish the gold standard may find themselves reduced
from opulence to poverty.</p>

<p>Ricardo continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But this very quality subjects to greater variations of value during periods of
war or extensive commercial discredit, when it is often collected and hoarded, and
may be urged as an argument against its use. The only objection to the use of
silver as the standard is its bulk, which renders it unfit for the large payments
required in a wealthy country; but this objection is entirely removed by the substituting
of paper money as the general circulation medium of the country. Silver,
too, is much more steady in its value in consequence of its demand and supply
being more regular; and, as all foreign countries regulate the value of their money
by the value of silver, there can be no doubt that on the whole silver is preferable
to gold as a standard, and should be permanently adopted for that purpose.</p></div>

<p>Innumerable additional citations from authors of repute could be
adduced to fortify this position.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the fluctuations in the value or purchasing
power of both gold and silver have always been admitted by
scientific writers. They were so well understood three centuries
ago that in Queen Elizabeth's reign (1576) the British Parliament
directed that the rents reserved in the long leases of certain college
lands should be payable, not in money, but in wheat. And at various
times during the past seventy years propositions have been
formulated to substitute for gold and silver as a standard of value
for deferred payments, a tabular statement of the prices of the principal
articles of commerce, to be made by official authority and
published from time to time, by the average of which the fluctuations
of gold could be ascertained and proper allowance made for
them in the settlement of time transactions. Professor Jevons, Prof.
Francis A. Walker, and other political economists of note have expressed
approval of such a tabular standard for long-time contracts,
as securing greater equity than would gold as a measure of values.</p>

<p>Those who now assert that silver has fallen and that gold has not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p044" id="Page_p044">[44]</a></span>
risen in value arrive at this conclusion by a very safe process of
reasoning. First, to show that silver has fallen they measure it by
gold alone, without reference to the general range of prices; and
then to prove that gold has not risen they make it the measure of
itself. An increase or decrease of the value of either can not be ascertained
by reference to the other, and certainly not by constituting
either of them a standard by which to judge itself. It would of
course be forever impossible to show any change in the value of gold
or silver, or of anything else, measuring it by itself. It is only by
looking at the relations which both metals bear respectively to a considerable
range of commodities generally dealt in as well as to each
other, that it can be ascertained with certainty what has happened.</p>

<p>Not only upon consideration of all the facts I have given, but upon
the logic of the situation, it must be obvious that gold has risen and
will continue to rise in value as long as its volume decreases and the
demand for it increases. Since 1860, when 77 per cent.
of the combined yield of the two metals, it has diminished not only
in relative proportion to the yield of silver, but it has diminished
absolutely. For the five years ending with 1860 the yield of gold
throughout the world was $137,000,000 a year; for the five years
ending 1889 the yield was but $110,000,000 a year. If, as claimed
by the advocates of the single gold standard, an increase in the yield
of silver decreases the value of silver, by what system of logic can
they deny that a decrease in the supply of gold increases the value of
gold?</p>

<p>In a late issue of the London Economist, that of April 26, 1890, I
find an editorial article relating to the recent discussion on bimetallism
in the British House of Commons. That article comments
somewhat sharply on Mr. Smith's assertion that "a conspiracy had
been formed among the financial class in Europe and America to get
rid of silver as full-valued money in order to increase the value of
gold, in which their revenues are paid." In the course of his comments
the editor, by "confession and avoidance," admits our whole
contention as to the rise of gold and the fall, as a natural consequence,
of the prices of commodities. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It may not be amiss, however, to point out that the increase in the exchangeable
value of gold has been by no means such a gain to the financial class as he
in common with many others suppose; for advantage has been very largely taken
of it to cut down the return upon the capital which the financial classes have invested.
It has favored debt conversion schemes, and it has been one of the influences
that have caused the rate of interest in general to decline so decidedly,
that, all round, the yield of investments is now very appreciably lower than it was
fifteen years ago. The idea that the creditor class have realized unmixed gains
and the debtor class have suffered unmitigated losses by the alteration in the purchasing
power of gold is thus altogether fallacious. There has in their case, as
in all others, been a species of compulsory give and take. Each has gained and
each has lost something, and now that the process of readjustment has been carried
so far it would be unwise to the last degree to unsettle everything again by
such legislation as the bimetallists propose.</p></div>

<p>The editor of the Economist is to be commended for at least one
thing. He does not quibble as to the most important point in the
bimetallic controversy. He frankly admits that gold has risen, and
does not, as some others do, attribute the fall of prices to improvements
in methods of production.</p>

<p>He also admits that coincidently with and caused by the rise in
gold there has been a great decline in the rates of interest, and,
strangely, claims that the debtor is compensated for the rise in the
value of money by the ability to convert the debt into one bearing a
lower rate of interest, or, as he calls it, resorting to "debt-conversion
schemes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p045" id="Page_p045">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>He does not inform us how any compensation can be made to the
the debtor for the time the debt has been running, as to which it can
not be converted, nor for the enhanced amount exacted from the current
earnings of labor by the rise in the value of money to pay taxes
and the expenses of Government, nor for the loss entailed on the
debtor whose property is mortgaged on long time, where the holder of
the mortgage refuses to convert it into an obligation bearing a lower
rate of interest than originally contracted for. He suggests no method
by which to make whole those who have lost their property through
sheriff's sale by reason of falling prices and the rise in the value of
money. Neither does he state how long it will be before the next
confiscation is to take place, by reason of the continued operation of
the cause that produced the first. But he has been frank enough
to concede (what is never disputed except when the money question
is under discussion) that there has been a rise in the exchangeable
value of gold, and conceded its natural sequence, a fall in the
rates of interest.</p>


<p class="caption">IMPROVED METHODS OF PRODUCTION.</p>

<p>In order to justify their position it becomes necessary for the advocates
of continued demonetization of silver to insist that the fall
of prices is not due to the rise in the value of gold but to improved
methods of production.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause to which it is to be ascribed, the undoubted
fact is that a fall of prices throughout the western world set in
concurrently with the reduction of the world's money volume by the
demonetization of silver. It was well understood at the time by
those who had given consideration to the subject that demonetization
alone would effect that result. This is manifest from an article
in the London Daily News, a paper of exceedingly large circulation,
quoted in the Journal of the Statistical Society of England for 1873,
page 395. Referring to the adoption of the single gold standard by
Germany the Daily News said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As the annual new supply of gold throughout the world is reckoned at little
more than &pound;20,000,000 ($100,000,000), and the usual demand for miscellaneous purposes
is very large, it follows that, if the German Government perseveres in its
policy, the strain upon the existing stocks and currencies of gold will be most severe.
For a time, at least, unless the annual production of gold should suddenly increase,
the money markets of the world are likely to be perturbed by this bullion scarcity,
and the fall in the value of gold&mdash;&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">which means the rise in prices that for some time had prevailed;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">of which so much has been heard, will be checked or reversed.</p></div>

<p>The yield of gold did not "suddenly increase," and the intelligent
prophecy of the Daily News was fully realized, not merely to the
extent of a check to the rising prices; (or, as it is styled by the Daily
News, a check to the "fall in the value of gold,") but to the extent
of an immediate rise in the value of that metal, and a persistent and
deplorable fall in the general range of prices.</p>

<p>This prophecy that the "fall in the value of gold" would be
checked by the demonetization of silver; or, better, reversed by it,
was welcome reading to the creditor and income classes of England
and of the world.</p>

<p>That it was "reversed," and the value of gold appreciated, is as
plain as that; one being subtracted from two, there is but one for a
remainder.</p>

<p>The immediate fall in prices of commodities was the natural, the
anticipated, and the deliberately intended result of that movement.</p>

<p>But we are now assured that this fall is not due to any monetary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p046" id="Page_p046">[46]</a></span>
cause, but to the greater efficiency of machinery in the production
of commodities.</p>

<p>No advocate of an increased volume of money denies that in a few
departments of manufacture there have since 1873 been improvements
tending to economize labor and cheapen products; but they
emphatically deny and challenge proof that improvements of mere
detail in the manufacture of some articles will account for the extraordinary
fall of price since that time in almost every product of industry.
We are also told that the development of the system of transportation,
both by land and sea, have tended to lower the price of commodities
to the consumers. I grant it. But we had those improvements
before 1873.</p>

<p>The inventions made between 1873 and 1890, the period of falling
prices, were no more important or radical in their effect on industry,&mdash;tended
no more to cheapen commodities, than did those
from 1850 to 1873, the period of rising prices. Indeed the inventions
which preceded 1873 were as a whole much greater in scope, more
far-reaching in result, and more revolutionary in their effects on industry,
than those of the later period. All the great basic improvements
had been invented, and had been incorporated with the industrial
system of all civilized countries long before 1873, if we
except the electric light and the telephone. We have had the steam
engine, the cotton gin, and the spinning-jenny since the last century;
the railroad and the steam-ship since the '30's; the telegraph, the
mechanical reaper, steam-plow, and other agricultural labor-saving
devices since the '40's; the sewing machine since 1854, and the Bessemer
process and steel rail since 1857.</p>

<p>The forced construction into which their position drives the advocates
of the gold standard is well illustrated in a recent number of
a magazine of high standing in this country, in which I find the
following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But if it be demurred, does not a debt incurred, say, ten years ago require to-day
more wheat or iron for its satisfaction than the sum could have bought when
first borrowed? Certainly, but the wheat or iron represents no more labor now
then it did ten years ago, and its increase in quantity stands for the new efficiency
which applied science has bestowed on toil.</p></div>

<p>Observe how deftly the writer places iron, in the manufacture of
which there have admittedly been some improvements, in the same
category with wheat, in the production of which the improvements
within any recent period have been of the most trifling character.
It will be exceedingly difficult to convince the farmers of this country,
whose mortgages are eating up the proceeds of their labor,
that the enormous decrease in the debt-paying power of their products
is made up to them in "the new efficiency which applied
science has bestowed on toil."</p>

<p>As well might it be maintained that the rise of prices and the concurrent
wave of universal prosperity, experienced after 1849, was not
due to the increase of the world's money stock from the mines of California
and Australia, but to some sudden, unaccountable, and complete
loss of all improvements theretofore attained in the arts and
industries of the world.</p>


<p class="caption">EFFECT OF CHECKS AND CLEARING-HOUSES.</p>

<p>But it is said that checks, notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and the
facilities afforded by clearing-houses effect such economy in the use
of money that it goes farther now than formerly, and that therefore
so large a volume of money as was formerly needed is not needed at
present. It is sought thus to escape the conclusion that the fall of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p047" id="Page_p047">[47]</a></span>
prices is the result of a shrinkage of the volume of money, or at least
to imply that if the money volume has been shrinking the agencies
mentioned have served to mitigate, if not entirely to counteract, the
effects of such shrinkage. This is in substance to claim that however
contracted the money volume of a country may become, the
system of checks and clearing-houses&mdash;on the principle of the compensating
balance&mdash;will expand in a proportion directly corresponding
to the contraction of the currency; that the greater the reduction
of the volume of money in the country the greater the increase in
the transactions of the clearing-house.</p>

<p>Nothing more absurd could be conceived. If this view were correct,
it would make no difference whether the amount of money in
circulation were large or small; a million dollars would be as efficacious
as $100,000,000, and even one dollar as effective as a million dollars;
and if we suppose the last dollar to have disappeared from circulation,
then, according to the sweeping and pretentious claims set
up for the clearing-house system, we could dispense altogether with
the use of money and rely exclusively on checks, drafts, and bills of
exchange.</p>

<p>That checks and clearing-houses are a great convenience to commerce
is not denied. They serve to a certain extent to make more
effective the money volume of a country. By the clearing house system
of off-setting the demands of the several banks, one against the
other, and requiring payment in cash of the balances only, large
amounts of loans may remain undisturbed and greater stability of
industrial conditions be secured.</p>

<p>Clearing-houses, however, were not established primarily for the
convenience of commerce, but for the profit of bankers. Whatever
amounts of money are economized by means of those institutions
bring compensation, by way of interest, to the banks. We may,
therefore, rely upon their being utilized to the utmost under all circumstances.</p>

<p>But, however much checks and clearing-houses may economize
the use of money, they are no novel devices. They are not some
untried and newly-invented instrumentalities. Checks have been
in use ever since the invention of banks. The clearing-house system
was established in this country in 1853. Contributing, as it does
contribute, to the pecuniary profit of the banks by making possible
an economy in the use of invested money, which the banks have
loaned out, and on which they are drawing interest, the system has
grown with the growth of the business of the country. It will
undoubtedly continue to grow, but with no greater acceleration
than population and business will warrant.</p>

<p>As it has been a part of the banking machinery of the country for
nearly forty years, and during that period has been utilized to the
utmost, the conditions of its existence and utilization have long since
become static conditions. The demands for currency have borne relation
to the needs of business, with clearing-house facilities in full
sight and operation; and at all seasons, in the adjustment of prices,
those facilities have had full force and effect. Assuming that at any
given period the business of the country were conducted with a given
volume of money, <i>plus</i> a certain volume of clearing house exchanges,
then, at a later period, an increase of business would demand an increase
in the volume of money, <i>plus</i> a proportionate increase in the
volume of clearing-house exchanges; having had this system in
full and effective use for forty years, it is as absurd to ascribe
the <i>fall</i> of prices in the last half of that period to any economy in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p048" id="Page_p048">[48]</a></span>
the use of money effected by the clearing-house system as it would
be to ascribe to the same cause the directly opposite effect&mdash;the <i>rise</i>
of prices&mdash;that took place in the first half of the same period.</p>


<p class="caption">THE PROOF AFFORDED BY THE FALL OF INTEREST.</p>

<p>If further proof were needed that gold has risen in value, it is, as
I maintain, to be found in the coincident fact of a decrease of rates
of interest on first-class securities. That decrease has kept even
step and pace with the rise in the value of money.</p>

<p>The rise in the value of gold, as shown by comparison with large
numbers of articles of commerce, has been between 35 and 40 per
cent. The rate of interest on gilt-edged securities shows a corresponding
decline. But unfortunately for the struggling people of the
country, the fall in the rate of interest on farm mortgages and on
property remote from money centers has been nothing like so great,
nor has it been so great as the fall in the price of agricultural lands,
and in the products of labor.</p>

<p>I hold, therefore, that a new axiom should be added to the science
of political economy; namely, that as the purchasing power of money
increases, its income producing power decreases, and in about the
same ratio; and conversely, when the purchasing power of money
decreases, its income-producing power increases. In other words,
when prices rise interest rises; when prices fall interest falls. When
money is increasing in volume and decreasing in value, prices rise,
and its investment in productive enterprises becomes more profitable,
and as a consequence interest rises. When it is decreasing in volume
and consequently increasing in value, prices fall, investment in
property and productive enterprises become precarious and unprofitable,
and, as a consequence, it avoids them, and seeks investment
in bonds and gilt-edged securities, aptly termed "money-futures,"
which for years have been increasing and continue to increase.</p>

<p>Some thirteen years ago I indulged in a little prophecy concerning
the rates of interest. I take no great credit to myself for it, but
in 1877&mdash;four years after the demonetization of silver&mdash;before the
rates of interest had materially fallen, and when the same contention
was made that is made now, namely, that money was cheap because
interest was low, and that the policies of the country were
wise because our credit stood on such a high plane, I submitted to
Congress the report of the Monetary Commission, from which I
quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Money can be borrowed readily only upon such securities as bonds which are
based on the unlimited tax-levying power of the Government, or upon the bonds
and stocks of first-class trunk-lines of railroad corporations, whose freight and
fare rates are practically a tax upon the entire population and resources of the
regions which they traverse and supply. The competition among capitalists to
loan money on these more ample securities has become very keen, and such securities
command money at unprecedentedly low rates. These low and lowering rates
of interest, instead of denoting financial strength and industrial prosperity, are a
gauge of increasing prostration. Large accumulations of money in financial centers,
instead of being caused by the overflow of a healthful circulation, or even a
proof of a sufficient circulation, are unmistakable evidence of a congested condition
caused by a decreasing and insufficient circulation. The readiness with
which Government bonds bearing a very low rate of interest are taken, instead of
showing that the credit of the Government has improved, is melancholy evidence
of the prostrated condition to which industry and trade have been reduced.</p>

<p>There need be no haste in refunding the public debt at the rates now proposed
and considered low. Unless the progress of the commercial world in the policy of
contracting money by demonetizing silver is checked, bonds bearing a much lower
rate of interest than any yet offered will be gladly accepted by capitalists here and
in Europe. When the money stock is diminishing and prices are falling, the lender
not only receives interest, but finds a profit in the greatly increased value of the
principal when it is returned to him. A loan of money made in 1809, if repaid in 1848,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p049" id="Page_p049">[49]</a></span>
would have been repaid with an addition of 145 per cent. in the purchasing power
of principal and interest, besides all the interest paid. Those who have loaned
money to this Government since 1861 have already received nearly as much in the
increased value of their principal as in interest, and all the probabilities are, in
respect to the four per cent. thirty-year national bonds now being negotiated, if
they are redeemed in gold, that more profit will be made by the augmentation in
the value of principal through interest. Indeed the signs of the times are, that
the bonds of a country possessing the unbounded resources and stable institutions
of the United States, payable in gold at the end of thirty years without any interest
whatever, would, through the increase of the value of that metal, prove a most
profitable investment.</p></div>

<p>All the facts of the situation to-day fully bear out the statements
I then made.</p>

<p>So determined are the advocates of the single gold standard in
defending the wisdom of its maintenance that facts whose existence
would at ordinary times be readily admitted, are, during a discussion
of the money question, pointedly denied. For example, within
the past few weeks we have seen in various eastern newspaper contributions
from prominent writers taking direct issue with the advocates
of silver as to the prevalence of general distress throughout
the country. They declare that there is no such distress, assert that
they have looked for it in vain, and derisively inquire where it is.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best authority I can cite in response to this inquiry
is the principal commercial daily journal of the east, the New York
Journal of Commerce, itself one of the most ardent and uncompromising
advocates of the gold standard. In an editorial article in
its issue of January 11, 1890, that journal said:</p>

<p class="caption">FAILURES IN BUSINESS.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>The public have been startled by the announcement that during the year 1889
there were 11,719 business failures in the United States, against 10,587 in 1888 and
9,740 in 1887. The estimated liabilities of last year's insolvents were $140,359,000
and the assets were $70,599,000, against $120,242,000 liabilities and $61,999,000 assets
for the failures of the previous year. Thus the failures in 1889 were more in number
and far greater in liabilities than for 1888, and the proportion of assets to the
obligations shows that the total insolvency was more disastrous. Why in a season
of profound peace, with no blighting frosts or withering droughts, and the
most abundant yield from the field, forest, and mine so many in business have
gone to the wall, no one seems able to answer. Many have tried their hand at a
solution of the problem, and not one, as far as we can discover, has satisfied even
himself with the result of his investigations.</p></div>


<p class="caption">HAS SILVER FALLEN?</p>

<p>In order to ascertain whether silver really has or has not fallen
in value, it is necessary that all the facts be taken into account
and the situation looked at from a correct point of view. If a person
be seated in a boat that is headed to the stream and wishes to test
whether or not he is making headway he must keep in view not the
stream, but the shore. The occupant of a railroad car who observes
a moving train on a contiguous and parallel track, frequently thinks
his own train at a stand-still, when in fact it may be in motion.</p>

<p>Whenever a rise or fall appears to take place in the price of any
one article or commodity, that is to say whenever a difference takes
place in the relation which that article bears to money&mdash;all other
commodities remaining unchanged&mdash;such difference must naturally
and properly be attributed to changed conditions affecting the commodity,
and not to a change in the value of money. But wherever
there is a fall in prices throughout the whole range of commodities
then it is clear that this change is mainly due to a change in the value
of money. Such however is the force of education and habit that
the masses of the people are slow to suspect any change in the
standard by which they have been accustomed to gauge or measure
all values. Indeed they find it difficult to understand how un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p050" id="Page_p050">[50]</a></span>der
any circumstances any change can take place in it. Having
their eyes fixed on the standard, and on that alone, they naturally
attribute to the articles measured, and not to the standard, any
difference that may seem to arise in the relation they bear to each
other.</p>

<p>But the apparent is not always the real. Nothing seems more
warranted by the evidence of our senses than that the earth is a
stationary object, while the sun revolves around it. For thousands
of years the world was convinced of the truth of the geocentric
theory of the universe, and millions of men have lived and died in
the confident belief that this planet was immovably fixed in space,
while the sun was a rolling and ever-shifting body. Even yet,
among the mass of mankind, so ever-present is this impression,
derived from ocular demonstration, that in spite of the declarations
of science, the world continues in common use the phrases
which originally described the process that took place, as men understood
it; hence we speak of the "rising" and the "setting"
of the sun. In the same way we speak of the rise or fall in the
value of commodities, without being particular to note whether the
change that has taken place is strictly a change in the value of the
article itself or a change in the money with which its value is measured.
Perhaps I can best illustrate my meaning by an allegory:</p>


<p class="caption">THE BATTLE OF THE STANDARDS. THE ALLEGORY OF THE CLOCKS.</p>

<p>In an ancient village there once stood a gold clock, which, ever
since the invention of clocks had been the measure of time for the
people of that village. They were proud of its beauty, its workmanship,
its musical stroke, and the unfailing regularity with which it
heralded the passing hours. This clock had been endeared to all
the inhabitants of the village by the hallowed associations
with which it was identified. Generation after generation it had
called the children from far and wide to attend the village school,
its fresh morning peal had set the honest villagers to labor; its noon-day
notes had called them to refreshment; its welcome evening
chime had summoned them to rest. From time immemorial, on all
festive occasions, it had rung out its merry tones to assemble the
young people on the green; and on the Sabbath it had advertised
to all the countryside the hour of worship in the village church.
So perfect was its mechanism that it never needed repair. So
proud were the people of this wonderful clock that it became the
standard for all the country round about, and the time which it
kept came to be known as the gold standard of time, which was universally
admitted to be correct and unchanging.</p>

<p>In the course of time there wandered that way a queer character,
a clockmaker, who being fully instructed in the inner workings of
time-tellers, and not having inherited the traditions of that village,
did not regard this clock with the veneration accorded to it by the
natives. To their astonishment he denied that there was really any
such thing as a gold standard of time; and in order to prove that the
material, gold, did not monopolize all the qualities characteristic
of clocks, he placed alongside the gold clock, another clock, of silver,
and set both clocks at 12 noon. For a long time the clocks
ran along in almost perfect accord, their only disagreement being
that of an occasional second or two, and even that disagreement
only at rare intervals, such as might naturally occur with the best
of clocks. But the Council of the village, in their admiration for
the gold clock, passed an ordinance requiring that all the weights
(the motive power) of the silver clock, except one, be removed from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p051" id="Page_p051">[51]</a></span>
it, and attached to those of the gold clock. Instantly the clocks began
to fall apart, and one day, as the sun was passing the meridian, the
hands of the gold clock were observed to indicate the hour of 1, while
those of the silver clock indicated 12.15. At this everybody in the
village ridiculed the silver clock, derided the silver standard, and
hurled epithets at the individual who had had the temerity to
doubt the infallibility of the gold standard.</p>

<p>Finally, the divergence between the clocks went so far that it
was noon by the gold standard when it was only 6 a. m. by the
silver standard, so that those who were guided by the gold standard,
not withstanding that it was yet the gray of the morning, insisted
on eating their mid-day meal, because the gold standard indicated
that it must be noon. And when the sun was high in the
heavens, and its light was shining warm and refulgent on the dusty
streets of the village, those who observed the gold standard had already
eaten supper and were preparing for bed.</p>

<p>But this state of things could not last. It was clear that the difference
between the standards must be reconciled, or all industry
would be disarranged and the village ruined.</p>

<p>Discussion was rife among the villagers as to the cause of the difference.
Some said the silver clock had lost time; others that both
clocks had lost time, but the silver clock more than the gold; while
others again asserted that both clocks had gained time, but that the
gold clock had gained more than the silver clock.</p>

<p>While this discussion was at its height a philosopher came along
and observing the excitement on the subject remarked, "By measuring
two things, one against the other, you can never arrive at any
determination as to which has changed. Instead of disputing as to
whether one clock has lost or another gained would it not be well to
consult the sun and the stars and ascertain exactly what has happened."</p>

<p>Some demurred to this because, as they asserted, the gold standard
was unchanging and was always right no matter how much it might
seem to be wrong; others agreed that the philosopher's advice should
be taken. Upon consulting the sun and the stars it was discovered
that what had happened was that both clocks had gained in time
but that the gain of the silver clock had been very slight, while that
of the gold clock had been so great as to disturb all industry and
destroy all correct sense of time.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this demonstration, there were many who adhered
to the belief that the gold standard was correct and unchanging,
and insisted that what appeared to be its aberrations were not
in reality due to any fault of the gold clock, but to some convulsion
of nature by which the solar system had been disarranged and the
planets made to move irregularly in their orbits.</p>

<p>Some of the people also remembered having heard at the village
inn, from travellers returning from the East, that silver clocks were
the standard of time in India and other barbarous countries, while
in countries of a more advanced civilization gold clocks were the
standard. They therefore feared that the use of the silver clock
might have the effect of degrading the civilization of the village by
placing it alongside India and other barbarous countries. And although
the great mass of the people really believed, from the demonstration
made, that the silver standard of time was the better one,
yet this objection was so momentous that they were puzzled what
course to pursue, and at last advices were consulting the manufacturers
of gold clocks as to what was best to be done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p052" id="Page_p052">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Now our gold standard men are in the position of those who first
refuse to look at anything beyond the two things, gold and silver,
to see what has happened, and who, when it is finally demonstrated
that all other things retain their former relations to silver, still persist
that the law which makes gold an unchanging standard of
measure is more immutable than that which holds the stars in their
courses. If they will compare gold and silver with commodities in
general, to see how the metals have maintained their relations, not
to one another but to all other things, they will find that instead of
a fall having taken place in the value of silver, the change that has
really taken place is a rise in the value of both gold and silver, the
rise in silver being relatively slight while that of gold has been
ruinously great. And those who do not shut their eyes to the truth
must see that the change of relation between the metals has been
effected by depriving silver of its legal-tender function, as the want
of accord between the clocks was brought about by depriving the
silver clock of a portion of its motive power&mdash;the weights. The
only thing that has prevented a greater divergency between the
metals is the limited coinage by the United States&mdash;the single weight
that, withheld from the gold clock, prevented its more ruinous
gain.</p>


<p class="caption">THE PURCHASING POWER OF SILVER IN 1873 AND 1889.</p>

<p>If I can show that for a period of seventeen years, since its demonetization
in 1873, silver has lost none of its purchasing power, none of
its command over commodities; that is to say, if I can show that 412&frac12;
grains of silver to-day, uncoined, and shorn by hostile legislation of
its principal element of value&mdash;the money use&mdash;will buy as much as
would 412&frac12; grains of silver in 1873 (when our silver dollar bore a premium
over gold) of all the articles that enter into the daily consumption
of the people, it must be manifest that silver has not fallen in
value.</p>

<p>I present a table which I shall ask to have inserted in the <span class="smcap">Record</span>
as part of my remarks, showing the purchasing power of 412&frac12; grains
of silver, nine-tenths fine, in 1873 and 1890, respectively, so far as
concerns several leading articles of daily consumption.</p>

<p>The table is as follows:</p>

<p>From this table it conclusively appears that while in 1873 the standard
silver dollar of 412&frac12; grains, which then bore a premium over
the gold dollar, would purchase four-fifths of a bushel of wheat; to-day
the same quantity of silver, without the advantage of coinage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p053" id="Page_p053">[53]</a></span>
and merely as bullion, will also buy four-fifths of a bushel of wheat&mdash;the
only difference between the figures for the two years being that
at the present time 412&frac12; grains of silver bullion, as will be seen by the
table, will buy a fraction of a bushel more than would 412&frac12; grains of
coined silver in 1873.</p>

<p>If, then, silver has fallen, it is manifestly not in its relation to wheat.</p>

<p>By the same table it is shown that the silver dollar of 1873, containing
412&frac12; grains of silver, nine-tenths fine, would purchase one
and eight-tenths bushels of corn; in 1890, a like number of grains of
silver, uncoined and estimated at its gold value, will purchase one
and nine-tenths bushels of corn. Here again the advantage is
slightly in favor of the 412&frac12; grains of silver bullion of 1890. This
shows conclusively that silver has not fallen in its relation to corn.</p>

<p>The figures of the same table show that in 1873 a coined silver dollar
of 412&frac12; grains would buy 5<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></small> pounds of cotton; to-day 412&frac12; grains
of uncoined silver will buy 6&frac34; pounds of cotton. From this it appears
that silver has not fallen relatively to cotton, the great staple
of universal use, but that, on the contrary, it has advanced somewhat
in its purchasing power when compared with that article.</p>

<p>In order to present the question from another point of view I submit
another table showing the number of grains of silver that are
required in 1890 and the number which were required in 1873 to buy
a bushel of wheat, a bushel of corn, &amp;c., by which it will even more
clearly appear that silver has not fallen in value in respect to commodities.</p>

<p>From this table it will be seen that in 1873 it required 474 grains
of standard silver, in the form of coined dollars, to buy one bushel
of wheat; in 1890, only 468 grains of standard silver (and that merely
in bullion form, or in other words, at its market value) are required
to buy a bushel of wheat. This does not show that silver has fallen
in value, in its relation to wheat, but, on the contrary, that it has
risen in value.</p>

<p>In 1873 it required 224 grains of silver to buy a bushel of corn;
to-day only 209 grains of silver are required to buy the same quantity.
These figures fail to prove that silver has fallen in value, in
its relation to corn. On the contrary, again, it has risen.</p>

<p>In 1873 a pound of cotton could not be had for less than 77&frac12; grains
of silver; to-day the same pound of cotton can be bought for 61<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p054" id="Page_p054">[54]</a></span>
grains of silver. Silver, therefore, has not fallen, but risen in value
in its relation to cotton.</p>

<p>In 1873 96 grains of silver were required to buy one dozen eggs;
to-day only 76 grains of silver are required to buy the same quantity
of eggs. Silver therefore has not fallen but risen in value, in its relation
to eggs.</p>

<p>These comparisons might be continued with the same results as to
a great majority of the articles entering into general use.</p>

<p>These figures demonstrate that in its relation to all commodities
that enter into the daily consumption, silver has not fallen in
value, but, as is clearly seen, while holding a remarkably steady
ratio to commodities, has slightly increased in value, as is shown
by the fact that a less number of grains of the metal are to-day
required to purchase the same quantity of the commodities mentioned
than were required in 1873.</p>

<p>In relation to what, then, is it that silver has fallen? As it has
not fallen in relation to commodities, there remains but one thing
in relation to which it can be said to have fallen, and that one thing
is gold. The phrase "the fall of silver" is the ingenious and cunning
invention by which it is sought to cast on that metal the discredit
of depreciation rather than subject gold to the suspicion of
any change whatever. The term to correctly describe what has
taken place would be "the rise of gold;" but that term is scrupulously
avoided, as implying that gold does not remain immovably
fixed. That gold has risen, however, admits of no doubt, except to
those who willfully shut their eyes to facts of common observation.
The true test of the increasing or decreasing value of any one thing
is not to compare it with any other one thing, but with a large range
of commodities generally dealt in. It is not of so much importance
to know how much gold can be bought with a given amount of silver,
as it is to know how much bread, how much meat, and how
much clothing can be bought, and how much of all the things that
are necessary to the comfort and well-being of the people can be
bought with that amount of silver.</p>


<p class="caption">PROOF THAT GOLD HAS RISEN.</p>

side the gold prices of a number of leading commodities of commerce
in 1873 and 1889, respectively, and the amount in silver bullion

</table></div>

<p>What does an examination of this table show? It shows beyond
dispute that gold has risen in value.</p>

<p>A bushel of wheat that, according to the figures of the Bureau of
Statistics cost $1.14 in gold or silver in 1873, and which, as will be
seen by the table, still commands $1.12 in silver bullion, will to-day
bring only 87 cents in gold.</p>

<p>A pound of cotton that in 1873 cost the purchaser, in gold or silver,
16 cents, and which still commands 13 cents in silver bullion, will
bring only 10 cents in gold.</p>

<p>A pound of cheese that in 1873 cost the purchaser 11<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></small> cents in
gold or silver, and which now brings 12 cents in silver bullion, will
bring only 9 cents in gold.</p>

<p>A barrel of flour which in 1873 cost the purchaser $6.60 in gold or
silver, and which to-day commands $6.02 in silver bullion, will bring
but $4.70 in gold.</p>

<p>A pound of butter that in 1873 brought 18.4 cents in gold or silver,
and now commands 20.8 cents in silver bullion, will bring but 16.6
cents in gold.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that 412&frac12; grains of uncoined silver will to-day buy
as much of the leading articles of commerce as the coined gold dollar
would buy in 1873, yet the advocates of the gold standard characterize
it as a 72-cent dollar. Then the gold dollar of 1873 was a 72-cent dollar.
If the gold dollar of to-day be an honest and equitable dollar, that of
1873, which was worth much less, was a swindling and dishonest one;
and if gold continues to advance as it has been advancing, and with
the declining output of that metal there is no reason why it should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p056" id="Page_p056">[56]</a></span>
not, it will be but a short time before any other kind of dollar whose
value may be equal to that of the present gold dollar will be stigmatized
as a swindling 72-cent dollar. There never was a dollar
coined that did not legally and practically contain 100 cents. But
the creditors stigmatize a dollar of the value of the gold and silver
dollar of 1873 as a 72-cent dollar. May not the debtors, with much
more propriety, denounce the gold dollar of to-day as a 140-cent
dollar?</p>

<p>According to the admissions of the royal commission of England,
the gold dollar of to-day is to the producers of this country, measured
by their products, already at a premium of between 30 and 40 per cent.
over the gold dollar of 1873. The advocates of the gold standard have
no sympathy with our farmers and manufacturers who have to pay, in
commodities, a premium of 30 to 40 per cent. on gold, to meet their engagements,
but express extreme anxiety at the bare possibility that a
few importers might have to pay even a small premium in any form.
They insist that the money system of a population of 65,000,000, shall,
like an inverted pyramid, be made to rest upon its apex in order to enable
a few importers, most of whom are residents of foreign countries,
to make their payments abroad in gold.</p>

<p>Verily, Mr. President, the single gold standard is an expensive
luxury for our people to maintain.</p>

<p>Those who deride silver as a money-metal indulge in feeble attempts
at sarcasm by inquiring why we do not advocate the use of tin and
brass as money. They speak and write as though the idea of using
silver as money were a recent discovery or invention of people engaged
in silver mining. They also ignore the fact that the standard
silver dollar of the United States, which, with much satisfaction, they
stigmatize as a 72-cent dollar, requires a gold dollar to obtain it. It
is worth a gold dollar in London, in Berlin, in Vienna, in Saint Petersburg,
in Madrid, in Havana, and in all countries having commercial
relations with the United States. It can at once be exchanged into
the money of any country with only the slight deduction of cost of
shipment to this country&mdash;as is the case in the United States with
notes of the Bank of England, which are redeemable in gold.</p>

<p>Our silver dollar is not money in foreign countries&mdash;and it is to our
advantage that it is not&mdash;for were it money anywhere else than in
this country, we could not rely on its remaining here to maintain that
steadiness of prices indispensable to prosperity. But if any of our
silver dollars are found abroad, let no one suppose he can get them
by tendering 412&frac12; grains of silver bullion for each dollar. He will find
it will cost him precisely as much gold as it passes for in the United
States.</p>


<p class="caption">SOME EFFECTS OF THE RISE OF GOLD.</p>

<p>If a cotton planter in 1873 owed $10,000 he could then have paid it
with 60,975 pounds of cotton. To-day, by reason of the increased
command which gold has over commodities, it would take 101,010
pounds of cotton to pay that $10,000; not withstanding that the
money in which the debtor has paid the interest has each year become
more valuable than it was at the time he contracted to pay it.</p>

<p>The cotton manufacturer of the East who in 1873 owed $10,000
could then have paid it with 70,422 yards of uncolored cotton cloth;
to-day owing to the rise in the value of gold it would require 147,059
yards to pay that debt, without taking into account the amount lost
by the debtor in the greater sacrifice he had year by year to make to
pay the interest.</p>

<p>The farmer of the North and West who in 1873 owed $10,000 could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p057" id="Page_p057">[57]</a></span>
then have paid it with 8,733 bushels of wheat; to-day it would require
11,446 bushels of wheat to liquidate that debt, though he, too, has
year by year been "cinched" through the progressive increase in the
value of the money in which the interest has been paid. Or he could,
in 1873, have paid his debt with 1,514 barrels of flour; to-day it would
take 2,126 barrels of flour to pay the same debt.</p>

<p>The property of the country is fast passing into the hands of the
creditors, and if the iniquitous system is not reversed the condition
of our American farmers will be that of the farmers of gold-standard
countries. Instead of owning their farms they will be tenants
and rent-payers&mdash;a condition but little in advance of that which
prevailed in feudal days.</p>

<p>Machiavelli, describing a turbulent period in the history of Florence,
said:</p>

<div class="poem"><p>The people perished, but the brigands throve.</p></div>

<p>The brigandage of the Middle Ages, whether in Italy or elsewhere,
was a criminal defiance of law, but it was pursued at some risk, and
under manifest disadvantages. The brigand took his life in his hands.
He knew that his calling was unlawful; and, although ruthless in his
work, the method by which he exacted ransom of his occasional victim
was less destructive to the prosperity of the community than
the legalized brigandage of to-day by which, through a vicious system
of money, the great mass of the people are despoiled of their
property. The distinguishing characteristic of the brigandage of
the nineteenth century is that it scrupulously observes all legal
forms, and is conducted in the name of honor, honesty, good morals
and "sound finance." Mortgages are foreclosed only in accordance
with law, and the unearned increment which results from the increased
and increasing value of the money is transferred from the
debtor to the creditor, with punctilious regard for the statutes.</p>

<p>The demands of the brigand were enforced with guns and pistols;
those of the creditor are enforced with bonds and mortgages; both
exactions cruel and unjust, one by violence, the other by law. But,
in the latter case, so indirect is the method of operation that many
of those who are benefited by it are unaware of the perpetration of
any wrong. So subtle is the process that the change seems to be
only a change in the price of commodities, and thousands of men
who would scorn consciously to exact from any one more than a
just return for money loaned are beneficiaries of this vicious and
ruinous system.</p>

<p>With regard to the great body of the working masses it is sometimes
said they have no cause for complaint, that their condition now
is better than ever before.</p>

<p>But, Mr. President, it is not enough that men are better off than
they have been. When we reflect that nine-tenths of the inventions
and improvements constituting all the material features of the civilization
of this century have been made by working men, it is manifest
that they are entitled to much more of the comforts and convenience
of life than are now accessible to them. By watchful, repeated,
and aggressive efforts through their trade organizations, the
working men in many branches have been enabled to keep wages from
sinking, and occasionally to secure an advance; but, during a period
of falling prices, what is gained in this way by those who are kept
at work is lost to the working class as a whole by the remission to
idleness of part of their number.</p>

<p>The statisticians who seem to be employed by some propaganda to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p058" id="Page_p058">[58]</a></span>
prove by figures that prosperity prevails, point exultantly to the
fact that the wages of the working people seem constantly to have
increased while prices are falling, and they cite this to prove that
low prices are consistent with prosperity. They leave entirely out
of the account the large numbers of workmen who of necessity are
relegated to idleness on account of the lack of profit in business.</p>

<p>If you go into the workshops of any large manufacturing enterprise,
while prices are low and lowering, and ask the managers what
they now do when a strike occurs among the workmen, they will tell
you they find it impossible to shut down, because they have contracts
extending through time that they must fill, but, they add, "We pay
the wages demanded and we reduce the number of the employed."</p>

<p>If there are a thousand workmen employed, getting $2 each per
day, that would be a wage fund of $2,000 a day. If, when prices
fall and business becomes dull, the employer should want to reduce
the pay of each workman to $1.50 a day, and if the workmen, by
striking, should prevent that decrease, and if, then, 25 per cent. of
their number should be discharged, the loss to the working class, as
a body, and to the community at large, would be the same as though
the wages were reduced to $1.50 a day. Until these people who present
statistics can show us how many laborers are left out of employment
there is no possibility of arriving at any correct conclusion as to
what the wage fund is and how much wages are paid.</p>

<p>The loss to society is much greater when 25 per cent. of the people
are unemployed than if all continued at work upon a 25 per cent. reduction
of wages, because the relegation to idleness of 25 per cent.
of the workmen reduces the producing force, and lessens correspondingly
the aggregate annual production.</p>


<p class="caption">THE INTEREST OF THE MINING STATES IN THE REMONETIZATION OF SILVER.</p>

<p>Those who in the Senate and in the other House of Congress, represent
mining constituencies are taunted with the selfish purpose
of advancing the interests of their own States at the expense of those
of the country. It is sought to discredit the State which I have the
honor in part to represent on this floor, on the ground that the people,
being largely silver miners, have a personal interest in the remonetization
of silver.</p>

<p>The silver miners, Mr. President, need no defense here or elsewhere.
They have asked no favors from the Government, and ask none now.
They are bold, adventurous, and self-reliant men, who have wandered
across alkaline deserts, and over pathless mountains, braved
the assaults of hostile savages, the miasma of the Isthmus and the
storms of the Cape, and have planted the flag of a high civilization
on the western confines of this Republic. No more patriotic or public-spirited
class of citizens can be found within the borders of the
Union. Their business is an honorable one. When they entered
upon it they, in common with other citizens, had the warrant of
time, and the authority of all writers and thinkers on political economy,
for the belief that silver was, and would ever be, a money metal,
entitled to that full credit which from time immemorial had been
accorded to it. Silver, equally with gold, had been consecrated by
all the ages to the money use, and was dedicated to such use by the
Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>When the Constitution declared that Congress should have power
"to coin money and regulate the value thereof" and that "no State
shall * * * make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment
of debts," it warranted the belief on the part of all who adopted
the calling and undertook the business of mining, that gold and silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p059" id="Page_p059">[59]</a></span>
would continue to be money metals in the sense in which they had
been for thousands of years in the past. The silver miners were warranted
in presuming that when the Constitution esteemed so highly
the legal-tender function in the two metals, gold and silver, as that
it prohibited the States from making anything a legal tender except
coin of those two metals, it would not warrant the Congress of the
United States in taking from one of those metals the power of legal
tender and conferring that imperial function exclusively on the other.
Silver mining is a business requiring for its successful prosecution
skill, experience, and energy, while nine-tenths of the gold of the
world has come from placers; requiring neither organization, capital,
nor skilled labor.</p>

<p>The production of gold is much more a matter of accident and much
more liable to fluctuation than is the case with silver. The silver
miners therefore had a right to believe that so long as 23.22 grains of
pure gold should be entitled to recognition as one dollar, 371.25 grains
of pure silver would continue to be entitled to like recognition as one
dollar, and would possess the legal-tender function as such, for the
liquidation of all debts, public and private. On the strength of this
warranty of the Constitution, and of the unbroken experience of the
ages, large sums of money were invested in mining property and in
the employment of labor to develop the mines of the country. On the
strength of this belief and conviction, shared in by all the people of
the United States, that gold and silver would both remain the money
metals of the world, debts to an enormous extent were incurred, and
it was confidently believed that both metals would for all time be
available for the payment of those debts.</p>

<p>The silver-miners had learned from the history of mining, as well as
from hard and bitter experience, that the mines might at any moment
cease to yield, in which case their occupation would be gone and the
capital invested would be a total loss. But they did not suppose that
the verdict of all time would be reversed, or that the implied warranty
of the Constitution of the United States would be disregarded. They
did not believe that either one of the money metals would ever be
demonetized. And if a doubt had entered their minds on that subject,
they would naturally suppose that gold rather than silver would
be demonetized, gold being too limited in quantity to answer alone
the purposes of money in a rapidly advancing civilization; its yield
being uncertain and capricious and the prospect of a continued and
sufficient supply becoming less from year to year.</p>

<p>But, Mr. President, the degree of special interest which the mining
States have in this measure is not to be compared with that of
the other States of the Union.</p>

<p>According to the report of the Director of the Mint, the total quantity
of silver produced in the United States in the eleven years from
1878 to 1888 inclusive was 406,210,000 fine ounces. According to the
same authority the commercial value of that silver was $436,260,000,
and the coinage value $525,145,000. A very simple process of arithmetic
shows that the difference between the commercial and the
coinage value of that silver was $88,885,000, or an average of $8,080,544
each year. Assuming that amount to have been the annual difference
between the coinage and commercial value of silver for the five
years preceding 1878, we must add to the $88,885,000 the sum of
$40,402,220, making a total of $129,287,220 as the amount which the
silver miners, not of Nevada but of the whole United States in the
seventeen years ending 1889, lost by the demonetization of silver.</p>

<p>Having thus demonstrated in dollars and cents the degree of self<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p060" id="Page_p060">[60]</a></span>ishness
which, as is charged, is the motive of the miners in advocating
the remonetization of silver, let us glance at the degree of selfishness
which may be said to impel other classes of the community to advocate
the same cause.</p>


<p class="caption">THE INTEREST OF THE NON-MINING STATES IN REMONETIZATION.</p>

<p>The price of cotton for the year 1873, in gold or silver (then of
equal power), was 16.4 cents per pound. The price in 1889 was 9.9
cents.</p>

<p>The yield of cotton for 1889 was 7,000,000 bales, or 3,500,000,000
pounds.</p>

<p>Had not silver been demonetized that cotton would have brought
as good a price to-day as it did in 1873. At the price of 1873 the account
would have stood 3,500,000,000 pounds, at 16.4 cents, $574,000,000.
At the price of 1889 the account stands 3,500,000,000 pounds,
at 9.9 cents, $345,500,000, showing a loss in debt-paying and tax-paying
power on cotton alone (only one article of merchandise) in the
single year 1889, by reason of the fall in prices caused by the demonetization
of silver, of $227,500,000.</p>

<p>Having shown that the loss to the silver miners by the discount
on silver for the seventeen years from 1873 to 1889 was less than
$130,000,000, it will be seen that the loss in one single year to the
cotton planters of the United States is greater by $90,000,000 than
the total loss for the entire seventeen years to the silver miners of
the country.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as the cotton crop of 1889 was exceptionally large,
I will, for the purpose of my computation, discard it, and assume
instead that an average yield for the years between 1873 and 1889
would be 5,000,000 bales per annum&mdash;which is a fair average and by
no means high&mdash;5,000,000 bales, of 500 pounds each, are equal to
2,500,000,000 pounds.</p>

<p>At the price of 1873 the result of each year would be 2,500,000,000
pounds, at 16.4 cents, $410,000,000.</p>

<p>According to the figures given by the Bureau of Statistics the average
price received each year of the seventeen was 13.1 cents per
pound; 2,500,000,000 pounds, at 13.1 cents per pound, equal $327,000,000,
showing a difference of $83,000,000; that being the average each
separate year for seventeen years, or a total sum for the entire period
of $1,411,000,000, which represents the loss in debt- and tax-paying
power suffered by the cotton planters by reason of the demonetization
of silver.</p>

<p>This is the enormous tribute which has been exacted of the cotton
industry of this country in behalf of the gold "standard," and of
those who, for their own pecuniary advantage, cunningly induced
the Congress of the United States to demonetize silver. This is the
sum which the planters of this country have lost in debt-paying and
tax-paying power by that mad act of folly. As will be seen at a
glance, it is a loss vastly in excess of that suffered by the silver States
in the discount on the price of silver bullion.</p>

<p>So that, if the silver miners are taunted with having a personal
interest in the success of the movement for the full remonetization
of silver, the cotton planter must be placed in the same category,
and with ten-fold more reason.</p>

<p>A like computation with regard to wheat will show a loss in debt-paying
and tax-paying power of not less than $100,000,000 a year to
the farmers of the North and West, by reason of the demonetization
of silver&mdash;a total of $1,700,000,000 in the article of wheat alone in
seventeen years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p061" id="Page_p061">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus a loss, wholly unnecessary, of more than $3,000,000,000 in
debt-paying and tax-paying power is shown to have been inflicted
on the farmers and cotton planters of this country.</p>

<p>In comparison with this enormous loss to farmers and planters,
how paltry is the loss of $8,000,000 a year suffered by the silver
miners.</p>

<p>But, however large the direct loss to the debtors and to the country
by reason of falling prices, the losses that are indirect are of infinitely
greater magnitude, and stand out like a great mountain of
wrong superimposed upon the most deserving class in the community,
whose interests it should be the paramount duty of Government
to protect, a wrong more calamitous in its consequences than
any of the multitudinous wrongs which a shrinking volume of money
inflicts upon society.</p>


<p class="caption">THE ENORMOUS LOSS OF POTENTIAL WEALTH THROUGH INVOLUNTARY IDLENESS.</p>

<p>The political economist, Mr. President, deals with property <i>in esse</i>,
and producers employed. I propose for a moment to deal with property
<i>in posse</i> and producers unemployed. The wealth which the political
economist discusses is realized wealth; that to which I now
briefly invite your serious consideration is the wealth that might
be, and would be, brought into existence were the energies of all
the people utilized. For, while it has attracted but little attention
from writers on economic science, it will be found upon examination
that the non-employment of its members is incomparably the greatest
loss which an increase in the value of money and the consequent disorganization
of industry inflicts on society.</p>

<p>The great writers and thinkers on economic subjects discuss with
care the elements that enter into the production and distribution of
wealth. They follow in detail the manufactured article through
all its stages, from the crude material to the finished product; and,
when completed, they conduct it through the intricate channels by
which it reaches the hands of the consumer. The greatest consideration
is bestowed upon the labor employed and the wealth resulting
therefrom, but scarcely any thought is given to the immeasurable
mass of potential wealth not produced, but lying latent in the brains
and hands of the millions who are condemned to involuntary idleness.</p>

<p>While no mere sum in arithmetic can represent the enormous loss
suffered by a nation through this cause, let us see whether we can
arrive by figures at an approximate conception, at least, of the loss of
wages which it entails upon the working masses, and the corresponding
loss of wealth to the country.</p>

<p>The most thorough and painstaking investigation into the conditions
of labor in this country has been that which for many years
has been conducted by the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor. Its work
has been universally admitted to be free from bias, and devoid of all
attempt to establish any special hobby, or to force, by figures, the
proof of any preconceived theory.</p>


<p class="caption">SOME STATISTICS OF THE UNEMPLOYED.</p>

<p>An examination of the work of that bureau shows that, in 1887,
there were 816,470 persons engaged in wage earning in the State of
Massachusetts. Of those, 241,589, or nearly 30 per cent., were idle
during some part of the year&mdash;ranging from one to six or more
months. The average of their unemployed time was about four
months, or one-third of the year.</p>

<p>Now, 240,000 people idle for one-third of their whole time is equivalent,
in money loss, to the total idleness of one-third of that num<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p062" id="Page_p062">[62]</a></span>ber,
or 80,000 people, for the entire year. The whole number of
persons enrolled for labor in the State being 816,470, this is equivalent
to the total idleness of one-tenth of the people engaged in all
occupations.</p>

<p>If a number equivalent to one-tenth of the people in all occupations
are idle twelve months in the year in a State like Massachusetts,
where labor is better organized, better classified, and more efficiently
ordered than elsewhere in this country, it can not be presumed that
any other State of the Union will exhibit a smaller proportion of
unemployed laborers.</p>

<p>The Census Report of 1880 states the number of persons employed
in all occupations as 17,392,099, out of a population of 50,155,783, or
a percentage of 34.68 of the entire population. Our present population
being not less than 65,000,000, if we assume, as we are warranted
in doing, that a like proportion of the population is engaged in occupations
of all sorts, it is clear that we have to-day a working population
of 22,254,000 persons.</p>

<p>Accepting as correct the careful deductions from the Reports of
the Massachusetts Bureau of Labor that a number equivalent to ten
per cent. of the people are always out of employment we find that at
the present time there are 2,250,000 persons involuntarily idle in this
country. How faintly does the term "the army of the unemployed"
describe this vast number of eager and willing men seeking in vain
the opportunity to earn a livelihood for themselves and families.</p>

<p>Were the business of the country in the active condition in which
it could not avoid being if our money system were perfectly adjusted
to industry, and if employers were competing for laborers
with the same degree of eagerness that laborers are competing for
employment, the average wage of a day for a working man would
not be less than $2. This would make but the moderate sum of $50 a
month for each workman, which, under the most thrifty system of
household economy, can not be considered more than enough for
the support of an American family.</p>


<p class="caption">THE WAGE LOSS FROM INVOLUNTARY IDLENESS.</p>

<p>By multiplying the number of persons thus shown to be idle, by
this moderate average wage, we arrive at the amount of $4,500,000
as the daily sum which is lost to the wage earners of the United
States by the non-employment of labor. This is a money loss of
$27,000,000 a week, $117,000,000 a month, or the amazing sum of
$1,404,000,000 a year. A saving of this sum for a year and three
months would pay our entire national debt. This being the loss in
a single year, we can imagine (making due allowance for difference
in the numbers of the population) how stupendous has been the loss
to the nation during the past seventeen years, a loss exceeding incomparably
all other losses whatsoever.</p>

<p>If a crop of wheat be lost, it is appropriately noted as a public misfortune;
if a city be burned down, or swept away by flood, it is
properly regarded as a great national calamity, and the sympathies
of all the people go out in unstinted measure to the sufferers. But
here is a loss as real and as deplorable as any ever caused by flood
or fire&mdash;a loss whose consequences, while not so apparent, are as destructive
to national prosperity as the burning of ten cities, or the
occurrence of one hundred and forty Johnstown disasters every year,
and always to the people who can least afford it. Yet it passes
almost wholly unheeded except by the sufferers.</p>

<p>A war that would take a million of men from industry and deprive
the country of the production which would result from their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p063" id="Page_p063">[63]</a></span>
labors, would be regarded as a calamity of unsurpassable magnitude,
yet a shrinkage in the volume of money relatively to population
withdraws much more than that number from productive
pursuits, and without the salutary discipline and restraints of military
life, subjects them to conditions of which the unavoidable results
are poverty and crime.</p>

<p>Imagine, Mr. President, the unhappiness, discontent, and even despair
implied in the mere statement that 2,000,000 men are constantly
out of employment; (or, what amounts to the same thing, that three
times that number are idle for four months in the year!) Imagine,
what it means to the working people of this country to be deprived
of the enormous sum of $1,400,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>But, aside from the effect on the individual, what benumbing consequences
are entailed upon the nation by the idleness of so large a
number of its people. The loss of the wealth which the labor of those
men might have created is a loss never to be retrieved. When the
money volume of a country is sufficient to keep prices from falling,
and thus to encourage capital to seek productive enterprises, in
which labor is employed, every willing man is kept at work, and no
country can enjoy any higher degree of prosperity than when all its
people are employed, and the products of their labor equitably distributed.</p>

<p>Much, I believe, of the prejudice against silver money arises from
an idea, conscientiously entertained, by many, that gold money has
the greater "intrinsic value." I shall, therefore, Mr. President, at
the risk of being a little abstruse, discuss that point.</p>


<p class="caption">THE MEANING OF VALUE.</p>

<p>No discussion of the subject of money can be intelligently conducted
without a correct conception of the meanings attaching to the
terms employed. For a misconception of those meanings is the root
of much of the confusion and difficulty by which the subject is surrounded.</p>

<p>"Value" is a word which, of necessity, is more frequently used&mdash;and,
I will add, more frequently misused and misunderstood&mdash;than
any other employed in the discussion of economic science. Volumes
have been written upon it, and yet, from the daily misapplication of
the word in leading magazines and newspapers, it is evident that its
meaning is very imperfectly understood.</p>

<p>The idea involved in the word "Value" is so broad and pervasive
that within the limits of a speech it would be impossible to discuss
it in all its bearings. I shall not, therefore, at this time, do more
than present what I conceive to be a basic definition of it.</p>

<p>Value is human estimation placed upon desirable objects whose
quantity is limited, and whose acquisition involves sacrifice. In
order that an object may have value it must not only be the subject
of human desire, but there must be a limitation of its quantity, and
its acquisition must demand a sacrifice from him who would obtain
it. The term "intrinsic value" is used by many writers with a total
disregard of the idea involved in the word <i>value</i>. An article may
have estimable qualities that are intrinsic, but no article whatever
can have intrinsic value. Its "value" is the mental estimation of
its qualities, as modified by the limitations of its quantity and the
amount of sacrifice necessary to obtain it. In other words, value is
subjective, not objective. In economic discussion, however, value
is treated as though it resided in the object, rather than in the mind,
and while, for convenience, I may occasionally use it in that sense,
it is important to bear in mind the distinction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p064" id="Page_p064">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>In that acceptation, value is usually divided into value-in-use,
and value-in-exchange. Certain esteemed qualities of an object
may make it of great value-in-use; but unless its acquisition demand
sacrifice, it can have no value-in-exchange. It is only with
this class of value that economists deal. No matter how important
the intrinsic qualities of any article may be, if there be no limitation
of its quantity and its acquisition requires no sacrifice, it can have no
value in the sense in which the word "value" is used in political
economy. The air has qualities inestimable to mankind; it must be
regarded as incomparably the most useful of all the objects of
human desire; yet it has no value because there is no limitation
of its quantity. By reason of its universality and accessibility, air
requires no sacrifice to get it. If, however, circumstances should
render air limited in quantity it is conceivable that it might become
of surpassing value. A man confined in the "Black Hole" of Calcutta
would give a fortune for free access to air. So water, where
freely obtainable, without sacrifice, although indispensable to life,
has no value in the economic sense&mdash;no value in exchange. But
when not so obtainable, as in populous cities, where sacrifice of time
and labor would be necessary to obtain it from river, lake, or spring,
people pay for the convenience of having it in their homes. The indispensable
prerequisites of value in all objects are utility&mdash;either
actual or attributed&mdash;combined with limitation of quantity and the
sacrifice necessary to be made in order to obtain it.</p>

<p>But value is not a property inhering in any article itself.  It is not
intrinsic. If the value were inherent or intrinsic it could not be
taken away.</p>

<p>To illustrate: A generation ago the cradle with which wheat was
harvested was said to possess intrinsic value. It was undoubtedly
one of the most useful of all the articles needed by man. All that
was then in that machine is in it still, yet the value is gone. Had
the value been something that was intrinsic, had it resided in the
object, and not in the mind, that cradle would still be worth all that
it ever was. So, on the other hand, an article may possess most
estimable qualities, but if those qualities are not known or recognized
by the human mind the article will have no value.</p>

<p>A few years ago cotton seed had no value as an article of general
commerce. To-day it is exceedingly valuable, because it has been
found to possess estimable qualities not before suspected.</p>

<p>Indeed so strongly does the idea of value rest upon the estimation
of the mind that it is not even necessary for an article to possess in
reality any desirable quality whatever in order to have value. It
will be sufficient if such quality is popularly attributed to it. Numbers
of instances could be cited in which there was present no element
of value except limitation of quantity, added to a mere belief,
or conception of the mind, that the article had desirable qualities.
Many will remember that a few years ago a herb called "Cundurango"
was introduced into this country from Central America. It
was generally believed to possess healing qualities in cases of cancer,
and so came to have great value. As soon as this popular illusion
was dispelled the article ceased to have even the slightest
value.</p>

<p>Land being indestructible and irremovable, is believed to be the
embodiment of the idea of intrinsic value. Take, then, a lot on
Madison Avenue, New York; it is worth perhaps a thousand times
as much as a lot of equal size in a village remote from the city.
What proportion of its high price is derived from what is called its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p065" id="Page_p065">[65]</a></span>
greater "intrinsic" value? A lot on that fashionable thoroughfare
has no intrinsic attribute, or quality, that is not equally the attribute
or quality of the village lot. The difference in its value, or,
more correctly, the difference in the estimation in which it is held,
as compared with that attaching to the village lot, is derived wholly
from circumstances that are extrinsic, not from qualities that are
intrinsic.</p>

<p>The action of society in utilizing land in the neighborhood of the
city lot by building up around it gives that lot a value greater than
one of equal size elsewhere.</p>

<p>But in order that a thing may subserve a useful or beneficent purpose
it is not necessary that the quality which enables it to subserve
that purpose should be intrinsic or inherent in the thing itself.</p>

<p>To apply this reasoning to the subject under discussion&mdash;whatever
intrinsic qualities the metal, gold, may possess, they confer no force
whatever on gold-money.</p>


<p class="caption">WHAT IS MONEY?</p>

<p>The money of a country is that thing, whatever it may be, which
is commonly accepted in exchange for labor or property and in payment
of debts, whether so accepted by force of law, or by universal
consent. Its value does not arise from the intrinsic qualities which
the material of which it is made may possess, but depends entirely
on the extrinsic qualities which law, or general consent, may
confer.</p>

<p>Money is of transcendent importance to civilization. It is the
physical agency to which society has assigned the function of measuring
all equities, and it is the sole agency upon which that incomparable
function has been conferred. It is in terms of money that
society computes the material value of all human sacrifice, alike the
highest effort of genius and the daily toil and sweat of the millions
who labor.</p>

<p>In order to measure equitably the natural and inevitable mutations
in the value of other things, money should itself be of unchanging
value. That is to say, any given amount of money should, so far as
human foresight can regulate it, require at all times an equal amount
of sacrifice for its acquisition. Thus, in the case of a contract
made to-day, requiring the payment of a dollar twelve months hence,
that dollar when due should exact from the debtor precisely that
amount of sacrifice, and no more, which would be required had he
paid the debt the day after contracting it.</p>

<p>No one will deny that the most important quality that money
can possess is that it shall truthfully measure and state equities.</p>

<p>As I have shown by the figures heretofore cited, gold has risen in
value between 30 and 40 per cent. since the demonetization of silver.
It is not therefore so faithful a measure of value as is silver, which
as illustrated by a variety of examples, has maintained almost undisturbed
its relation to commodities.</p>


<p class="caption">THE VALUE OF MONEY, AS SUCH, NOT IN THE MATERIAL BUT IN THE STAMP. MONEY
IS AN ORDER FOR PROPERTY AND SERVICES.</p>

<p>The logic of the situation, and the reasoning of all the leading authorities
on money, lead irresistibly to the conclusion that its value
does not reside in the material, but in the stamp; in other words,
on the legal-tender function impressed on that material. It is an
order for property and services.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p066" id="Page_p066">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Aristotle, writing of money, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Money by itself * * * has value only by law, and not by nature; so that a
change of convention between those who use it is sufficient to deprive it of all its
value and power to satisfy all our wants.</p></div>

<p>And again he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But with regard to a future exchange (if we want nothing at present) money
is, as it were, our security that it may take place when we do want something.</p></div>

<p>John Locke, in "Considerations," etc., regarding money, published in 1691, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mankind, having covenanted to put an imaginary value upon gold and silver, by
reason of their durableness scarcity, and not being very liable to be counterfeited,
have made them, by general consent, the common pledges, whereby men are assured,
in exchange for them, to receive equally valuable things to those they
parted with, for any quantity of those metals; by which means it comes to pass
that the intrinsic value regard in those metals, made the common barter, is nothing
but the quantity which men give or receive of them; they having, as money,
no other value but as pledges to procure what one wants or desires.</p></div>

<p>Baudeau, reputed one of the most eminent of an early school of
French economists, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Coined money in circulation is nothing, as I have said elsewhere, but effective
titles on the general mass of useful and agreeable enjoyment which cause the
well-being and propagation of the human race.</p>

<p>It is a kind of a bill of exchange, or order payable at the will of the bearer.</p></div>

<p>Adam Smith says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A guinea may be considered as a bill for a certain quantity of necessaries and
conveniences upon all the tradesmen in the neighborhood.</p></div>

<p>Jevons's "Money and Exchanges," chapter 8, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those who use coins in ordinary business need never inquire how much metal
they contain. Probably not one person in two thousand in this kingdom knows,
or need know, that a sovereign should contain 123.27447 grains of standard gold.</p>

<p>Money is made to go. People want coin, not to keep in their own pockets, but
to pass it off into their neighbors' pockets.</p></div>

<p>Henry Thornton, in his work on Paper Credit, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Money of every kind is an order for goods. It is so considered by the laborer,
when he receives it, and it is almost instantly turned into money's worth. It is
merely in instrument by which the purchasable stock of the country is distributed
with convenience and advantage among the several members of the community.</p></div>

<p>John Stuart Mill says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The pounds or shillings which a person receives are a sort of ticket or order
which he can present for payment at any shop he pleases, and which entitle him
to receive a certain value of any commodity that he makes choice.</p></div>

<p>McLeod, Elements of Banking, Chapter I, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When persons take a piece of money in exchange for services, or products, they
can neither eat it, nor drink it, nor clothe themselves with it. The only reason
why they take it is, because they believe they can exchange it away whenever
they please for other things which they require.</p></div>

<p>On that view of money McLeod feels justified in styling it credit,
and he quotes in support of such a use of the term credit, Burke's
description of gold and silver as "the two great recognized species
that represent the lasting conventional credit of mankind."</p>

<p>Prof. Francis A. Walker, Money, Trade, etc., page 25, speaking
of carved pebbles, glass beads, shells and red feathers, used as money
in certain countries at certain times, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>They were good money, though serving no purpose but ornament and decoration.
They were desired by the community in general; men would give for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p067" id="Page_p067">[67]</a></span>them the fruits of their labor, knowing that with them they could obtain most
conveniently in time, in form, and in amount, the fruits of the labor of others.</p></div>

<p>On page 30 he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Men take money with the expectation of parting with it; this is the use to
which they mean to put it.</p></div>

<p>Again, Mr. Walker says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Money is that which passes freely from hand to hand throughout the community,
in final discharge of debts and full payment for commodities, being accepted
equally without reference to the character or credit of the person who offers it,
and without the intention of the person who receives it to consume it, or enjoy it,
or apply it to any other use than, in turn, to tender it to others in discharge of
debts or payment for commodities.</p></div>

<p>Even Bonamy Price, who is wedded to the gold standard, in his
Principles of Currency, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gold, in the form of money or coin, is not sought for its own sake, as an article
of consumption. It must never be regarded as valuable except for the work it
performs, so long as it remains in the state of coin. It can be converted at pleasure
into an end, into an article of consumption, by being sold; till then it is a
mere tool.</p></div>

<p>How many people ever so "convert" it that earn it?</p>

<p>The great philosopher, Bishop Berkeley, one of the most acute reasoners,
in my judgment, that modern times have produced, in the
"Querist," published in 1710, propounds the following pertinent and
suggestive questions:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whether the terms "crown," "livre," "pound sterling," etc., are not to be considered
as exponents, or denominations? And whether gold, silver, and paper are
not tickets or counters for reckoning, recording, or transferring such denominations?
Whether, the denominations being retained, although the bullion were
gone, things might not nevertheless be rated, bought, and sold, industry promoted
and a circulation of commerce obtained?</p></div>

<p>Dugald Stewart, professor of moral philosophy in the University
of Edinburgh, in his Lectures on Political Economy (Part I, Book
II), said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When gold is converted into coin, its possessor never thinks of anything but its
exchangeable value, or supposes a coffer of guineas to be more valuable because
they are capable of being transferred into a service of plate for his own use.
Why then should we suppose that, if the intrinsic value of gold and silver were
completely annihilated, they might not still perform, as well as now, all the functions
of money, supposing them to retain all those recommendations (durability,
divisibility, etc.) formerly stated, which give them so decided a superiority over
everything else which could be employed for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Supposing the supply of the precious metals at present afforded by the mines to
fail entirely the world over, there can be little doubt that all the plate now in existence
would be gradually converted into money, and gold and silver would soon
cease to be employed in the ornamental arts. In this case a few years would
obliterate entirely all trace of the intrinsic value of these metals, while their value
would be understood to arise from those characteristical qualities (divisibility,
durability, etc.) which recommend them as media of exchange. I see no reason
why gold and silver should not have maintained their value as money, if they had
been applicable to no other purposes than to serve as money. I am therefore disposed
to think, with Bishop Berkeley, whether the true idea of money, as such, be
not altogether that of a ticket or counter.</p></div>

<p>Appleton's Cyclopedia, defining money, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Anything which freely circulates from hand to hand, as a common acceptable
medium of exchange in any country, is in such country money, even though it
ceases to be such, or to possess any value in passing into another country. In a
word, an article is determined to be money by reason of the performance by it of
certain functions, without regard to its form or substance.</p></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p068" id="Page_p068">[68]</a></span></p>


<p class="caption">BASTIAT'S DESCRIPTION OF THE CROWN PIECE.</p>

<p>Bastiat, in his "Harmonies Economiques," describing money, used
the following illustration:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>You have a crown piece. What does it mean in your hands? If you can read
with the eye of the mind the inscription it bears, you can distinctly see these
words: Pay to the bearer a service equivalent to that which he has rendered to
society. Value received and stated, proved and measured by that which in on
me.</p></div>

<p>No words could more correctly describe the unit in a properly
regulated system of money. And notwithstanding the attempt to
discredit silver coinage, no piece of money, as I have already shown,
would better answer, by its steadiness of value, this description of
Bastiat's than would the American silver dollar if silver were remonetized.</p>

<p>So far as it applied to gold Bastiat's description was much nearer
accuracy in his day than it is in ours. In his life-time the mints of
France and of the Continent were open for the coinage of silver
equally with gold, and the money supply of the world was not constantly
narrowing by being limited to the yield of a single metal
whose annual output would hardly more than meet the demand for
the arts.</p>

<p>Were Bastiat alive at this time he would reform his description so
as to make it read as follows: "You have an American gold piece.
You have had it hoarded in a bank vault for fifteen years. What
does it mean in your hands? If you can read with the eye of the
mind the inscription it bears, you can distinctly see these words:
'Pay to the bearer 50 per cent. more service than he has rendered to
society; value not received or stated on me, but resulting from a cunning
manipulation of the law of legal tender, through the influence
of the holders of gold and of obligations payable therein, and as a
reward to the bearer for having had this money hid away and for depriving
society of its use for seventeen years.'"</p>

<p>When people are found everywhere working for money and not
for the things which they really need, it is clear that they are working
for money, not because of the material of which it is composed,
but because it is an order for property which they can at any time
obtain by parting with the money. To modify and elaborate Bastiat's
description of the crown piece, it might be said of the Money
Unit of the United States under a properly regulated system:</p>

<p>"You have a dollar. What does it mean in your hands? If you
can read with the eye of the mind the inscription it bears, you can
distinctly see these words: To all to whom this may come: Greeting.
This is a dollar&mdash;a unit of money&mdash;part of the great instrumentality
created by society to effect the multitudinous exchanges
of property and services among men. The amount of its command
is constant, because the increase in the volume of money is regulated
by the sovereign authority of the nation, with strict regard to
the increase of population and demand&mdash;hence the value of this unit
remains unchanging through time. It is an order for all property
on sale, and all services for hire; the proportionate amount of such
property and service to which its possessor is entitled being fixed
by the universal competition to get it."</p>


<p class="caption">GRESHAM'S LAW.</p>

<p>Many persons fear an outflow of gold from the operation of what
is known as "Gresham's law," namely, that "bad money will expel
good." Sir Thomas Gresham, a financier of Elizabeth's time, stated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p069" id="Page_p069">[69]</a></span>
that if a number of the gold or silver coins of any given denomination
were deprived of part of their pure metal, and so made cheaper
than the remainder, a successful circulation of the coins thus deprived
would result in the melting up or exportation of the coins of
standard weight. Writing of this, Mr. Jevons ("Money and the
Mechanism of Exchange," American edition, page 84) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gresham's remarks concerning the inability of good money to drive out bad
only referred to moneys of one kind of metal. * * * The people, as a general rule,
do not reject the better, but pass from hand to hand indifferently the heavy and the
light coins, because their only use for the coin is as a medium of exchange. It is
those who are going to melt, export, hoard, or dissolve the coins of the realm, or
convert them into jewelry and gold leaf, who carefully select for their purposes
the new heavy coins&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">and avoid the light or abraded coins.</p>

<p>There is, however, a theorem which applies to all money, but
which was recognized long before Gresham's time&mdash;although it has
been erroneously called an "extension" of the law or theorem of
Gresham.</p>

<p>That theorem is this: If, in any country, there are two forms of
money, each of which is a full legal tender, and one of which can be
obtained with less sacrifice than the other, the one requiring the least
sacrifice will be the cheaper, and if the unit of that cheaper money
will perform in every respect the same function in the payment of
debts and settlement of all obligations that can be performed by the
dearer money, then, for obvious reasons, the cheaper money will come
into universal use, and the dearer money will disappear. But it
does not follow that the cheaper money is bad money nor the dearer
money good money.</p>

<p>The best money is always the money of the contract, that is to say
a money whose dollar, whatever it may be made of, is equal in value
to the dollar of the contract. If the money of the contract is the
cheapest money, then that is the best money, that is the honest
money, and that is the only tolerable money.</p>

<p>If that be the sort of "cheap" money that drives out the dear
money, then manifestly the dear money is bad money.</p>

<p>A distinguished official of the Government, who was before a committee
of this body the other day, insisted that the proposed Treasury
notes should be redeemed in the "best money." I asked him what
was the "best money." "Why," he said, "the money that is worth
the most." Now, it strikes me, Mr. President, that if you have borrowed
a dollar, and, through a badly regulated money-system, are
made to pay a dollar worth 25 per cent. more than the dollar you borrowed,
you are not paying the best money, but the worst money; not
an honest dollar, but a swindling and dishonest dollar.</p>


<p class="caption">THE CREDITORS' DEMAND FOR THE "BEST MONEY."</p>

<p>The creditors tell us that all they want is "good money." They
and their friends glibly insist that all obligations must be paid in
"the best money." This is the delicate and plausible euphemism resorted
to in order to gloss over and, if possible, hide from the world
the odious and repulsive fact that what the creditors always want
is the <i>dearest</i> money&mdash;the money that costs the people the most sweat
and toil to obtain and which, as time passes, grows dearer and
dearer.</p>

<p>This cry for "the best money" is at last beginning to be recognized
for what it is&mdash;the cunning device of creditors to "catch the
conscience" of the people and play upon the sense of fairness that
characterizes the great mass of mankind. These interested parties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p070" id="Page_p070">[70]</a></span>
affect to believe that gold is, by nature, the only money metal, ignoring
the fact that until silver was displaced by hostile legislation it
was, and for four thousand years had been, the principal money metal
of the world. But they will no longer be permitted to hide their sinister
purpose under the cloak of a demand for the "best money." The
masses of the people are aroused on this subject and are beginning to
understand it.</p>

<p>According to all fair canons of construction the best money should
be and is a money of unchanging value, a money that exacts from
the debtor the same amount of sacrifice that he bargained for, and
which is all that the creditor is equitably entitled to receive. In
other words, the money of the contract, not a money whose exactions
are increasing at the rate of 2 per cent. per annum. As McCulloch
says, debts being stated in dollars and cents, it is not possible for the
creditor openly to augment his debtor's obligation by changing the
figures of the debt.</p>

<p>But, Mr. President, while they can not change the figures of the
debt, they are enabled, by a crafty manipulation of the money-volume,
to do that which, to the debtor, means the same thing; as
the following story will illustrate:</p>

<p>A usurer of the coarser type had lent $10,000 on a neighboring
farm, for which amount he took the farmer's note, secured by a
mortgage on the property. He coveted the farm, and in his anxiety
to secure it took his banker into his confidence. He informed the
banker that he wanted to get possession of this farm, but it would
bring $15,000 under the hammer, and he did not care to pay so much
for it. "I have a subtle chemical," said he, "by which I can obliterate
from the note and mortgage all trace of the rightful amount
($10,000), and that done, I can insert $15,000. Then, with the genuine
signatures on the note and mortgage I can bring suit, and as
the farm will not bring more than the face of the note, I shall succeed
to the property."</p>

<p>His friend, the banker, however, advised against this course, which
he characterized as not only dishonest, but vulgar, and as subjecting
the perpetrator of the act to serious penalties. "Honesty" said the
banker, "is the best policy." "But," he continued, "I can suggest a
plan by which you may accomplish the same end without running
counter to law, or the views of society. Why not join our propaganda
in advocacy of 'honest money.' Gold is decreasing in quantity,
and as the world has been ransacked for it in vain, it is likely
to continue decreasing. If we can strike down the twin metal, silver,
and devolve the entire money function on gold, it will double
the purchasing power of money. Then the foreclosure of your
mortgage will be sure to take your neighbor's farm, and probably
leave him in your debt besides. Instead of being punished for this,
you will receive the plaudits of the 'best society' for the <i>finesse</i> you
have displayed and the firm stand you have taken in favor of honest
money, and you will take high rank among 'the wisest and most
conservative of our financiers.' If your neighbor makes any objection
to your action, you may be able to secure his incarceration as a
lunatic, but if not, he will come to be regarded in the community as
a dishonest 'crank' who wishes to pay his debts in a depreciated
money; for it is the constant and assiduous care of our guild to teach
that only the dearest money, that which is the most difficult for the
laborer, the farmer, and the mechanic to get, is honest money, and
the dearer it is the more honest it is."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p071" id="Page_p071">[71]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">ALL MONEY SHOULD BE LEGAL TENDER.</p>

<p>To be of the fullest service to civilization whatever medium is used
to do the work of money should have full money power; that is to
say, it should be a legal tender. It is not sufficient that it will satisfy
the demands of the Government for taxes.</p>

<p>Whatever is given out by the Government in payment for services
rendered (and there is no other way by which payments can be made
from the Treasury) should carry with it to him who has rendered
the service and receives the payment, the absolute assurance that in
any need, or in any contingency, it will serve him as money. There
is no other means by which society can be saved from the effects of
panics and monetary crises.</p>

<p>With a watchful and intelligent regulation of the money volume,
and with the legal tender function attached to everything that is in
use as money, and doing the money work, so that it will serve as a
universal solvent, panics will be impossible. Under present conditions
when panics come, credit money&mdash;money not endowed with
the legal-tender function, which, under ordinary circumstances, has
always been accepted, is refused, and thousands of millions of dollars'
worth of property have been confiscated by creditors, because
of the scarcity of legal-tender money. As time advances and the
method of doing business on credit becomes more and more extended,
the more palpable it becomes that society can preserve itself from
these periodical convulsions only by broadening, under proper regulation,
the legal-tender basis on which, in the ultimate analysis, all
business rests.</p>


<p class="caption">MONEY A MEASURE OF VALUE.</p>

<p>There is nothing upon which the prosperity and happiness of a
people so much depend as on the integrity of their measure of values.</p>

<p>It is universally admitted that after the making of a contract requiring
future delivery of a specified number of pounds, bushels, or
yards of any commodity, it would be subversive of all equity and
justice to change the capacity of the measure constituting the foundation
of the contract. These measures, to be just, must remain unchanged.
But how infinitely more important is it that money, which
is the measurer of all other measures, should itself be unchanged?
Of what avail is it that the subordinate measures remain intact
while this, the supreme measure, into which all others are finally resolved,
is constantly changing? Its "value" is but another name
for its purchasing or measuring power. In the case of all time contracts,
therefore, any change in the value of money works a destruction
of equity, and one of the first objects of society should be to
maintain and enforce equities at all times and in all places. This,
so far as money can effect it, can only be done by an intelligent regulation
of the volume in circulation.</p>

<p>In a note to his edition of Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations,"
(page 502) Mr. J. R. McCulloch says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Money is not a mere commodity, it is also the standard or the measure by which
to estimate and compare the value of everything else that is bought and sold, and
if it be, as it undoubtedly is, the duty of Government to adopt every practicable
means for rendering all foot-rules of the same length, and all bushels of the same
capacity, it is still more incumbent upon it to omit nothing that may serve to
render money, or the measure of value&mdash;a measure which is undoubtedly of the
greatest importance&mdash;uniform or steady in its value.</p></div>

<p>Though a measure of value, money is a much more complicated
instrument than a yard-stick, pound weight, or bushel. Were it
not so, a child could fix value with the same precision as an adult.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p072" id="Page_p072">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>As value resides in human estimation, it will frequently vary as
to the same object. An intending purchaser may have one notion
of the value of an article, an intending seller another. Money,
therefore, is a measure of value in the sense that it is a measure of
the average human judgment&mdash;from which results price. As Mr.
McCulloch says, no means known to science or art should be left untried
to keep the value of money unchanging.</p>

<p>When a man promises to deliver money or makes any time contract,
he makes a mental calculation as to what amount of property, or of
the product of his labor, will enable him to meet his engagement.
If he be a farmer, raising wheat, there passes through his mind the
sacrifice and toil necessary to raise it, and the quantity he can raise;
if a cotton manufacturer the cost of spindles, of looms, and steam-engines;
the wages of labor and interest on plant.</p>

<p>I knew a cotton manufacturer who wanted $10,000. His business
was good. He was sober, honest, and industrious; had a thorough
knowledge of his trade; managed his employ&eacute;s himself, and took
the greatest pains to conduct his business on the strictest business
principles. He wanted the money to make some improvements in
his factory. He knew how many spindles and looms he had; how
much could be done with a pound of cotton, how much it cost, and
how much each spindle and loom would do. He said to a capitalist,
"I know all about cotton spinning and weaving, and do not know
anything about this thing called money, but I want $10,000 of it."
Said he, "My cloth is worth 10 cents a yard; it sells at that rate in
unlimited quantities by wholesale; nobody can make it any cheaper;
but I am not working a gold mine; I am not manufacturing legal-tender
paper money, and the only way I can get money is to swap
my cotton cloth for it. I will give you my note for 100,000 yards of
cotton cloth, which will be equal to $10,000, and will pay 2 inches a
yard each year as interest."</p>

<p>This was satisfactory to the capitalist, and the note was made,
signed, and delivered accordingly, and the improvements were made
in the factory.</p>

<p>During the year everything went smoothly; the spindles and looms
worked well, repairs to machinery were light; cotton had been
bought at proper rates; and no improved processes had been discovered
or applied in the production of cotton-cloth. There was no
hitch in any direction.</p>

<p>At the appointed time, the creditor called for his cloth. "I am
ready," said the debtor, "to pay the hundred thousand yards of cotton
cloth, with interest." When he came to measure it off, however,
he was astounded to find he was short. Some painful suspicions
crossed his mind. It seemed as though somebody had either robbed
him of cloth, or else he had not manufactured as much of it as he
had supposed. There did not seem to be so many yards of the cloth
as there ought to be. He knew he had used the same number of
pounds of cotton that it had been his custom to use for 100,000 yards
of cloth and for 200,000 inches of cloth in addition; still, there was
no denying the fact of the shortage.</p>

<p>He measured it again and again, and had finally to admit that he
was unable to keep his engagement. This was a source of great
distress to him. He could not sleep that night. But, the creditor
being importunate, the cotton manufacturer next morning borrowed
enough cloth from the proprietor of a neighboring factory and paid
his obligation. But, not understanding how his carefully made plans
had failed, and in order to avoid similar mistakes in the future, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p073" id="Page_p073">[73]</a></span>
had an examination made of the yard-stick and found that instead
of being 36 inches long the yard-stick he had used was 40 inches.</p>

<p>In talking the matter over with his neighbor, the cotton manufacturer
said: "I have been swindled; they 'rung in' on me a lengthened
yard-stick, by the measurement of which I have paid my debt,
and I have therefore paid in reality more than I contracted to pay."</p>

<p>"Well," said the friend, "I do not see that you are any worse off
than I am. I borrowed as much as you did, and at the same time;
but I agreed to pay my debt in money, and gave my note for $10,000
with interest. The increased command over cloth acquired by the
dollars I have had to pay, caused by the demonetization of silver,
has juggled me out of as much cloth as you have been juggled out
of by the lengthened yard-stick. But you have one recourse; you
can put into the penitentiary the man who 'rung in' the lengthened
yard-stick on you, while the increase in the value of the dollar which
I have paid has been effected in the name of the gold standard and
honest money, and leaves me without recourse."</p>

<p>In its ultimate analysis, money is the yard-stick, the bushel and
the pound weight of commerce.</p>

<p>When you shrink the volume of money, and so increase the measuring
power of the dollar, you lengthen the yard-stick, enlarge the
specific gravity of the pound and the cubical content of the bushel,
in violation of all equities.</p>

<p>It is utterly impossible to secure a proper regulation of the money
volume with gold alone, the yield of which has declined from an
average of $130,000,000 a year between 1851 and 1873 to $105,000,000
a year between 1873 and 1889.</p>


<p class="caption">THE VALUE OF MONEY FIXED BY THE COMPETITION TO GET IT.</p>

<p>Everybody admits that the value of all other things is regulated by
the play against each other of the forces of supply and demand. No
reason has been or can be given why the value of the unit of money
is not subject to this law.</p>


<p class="caption">WHAT IS THE DEMAND FOR MONEY?</p>

<p>The demand for money is equivalent to the sum of the demands
for all other things whatsoever, for it is through a demand first made
on money that all the wants of man are satisfied. The demand for
money is instant, constant, and unceasing and is always at a maximum.
If any man wants a pair of shoes, or a suit of clothes, he does
not make his demand first on the shoemaker, or clothier. No man
except a beggar makes a demand directly for food, clothes, or any
other article. Whether it be to obtain clothing, food, or shelter&mdash;whether
the simplest necessity or the greatest luxury of life&mdash;it is on
money that the demand is first made. As this rule operates throughout
the entire range of commodities it is manifest that the demand for
money equals at least the united demands for all other things.</p>

<p>While population remains stationary, the demand for money will
remain the same. As the demand for one article becomes less, the
demand for some other which shall take its place becomes greater.
The demand for money therefore must ever be as pressing and urgent
as the needs of man are varied, incessant, and importunate.</p>


<p class="caption">WHAT IS THE SUPPLY OF MONEY?</p>

<p>Such being the demand for money, what is the supply? It is the
total number of units of money in circulation (actual or potential)
in any country.</p>

<p>The force of the demand for money operating against the supply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p074" id="Page_p074">[74]</a></span>
is represented by the earnest, incessant struggle to obtain it. All
men, in all trades and occupations, are offering either property or
services for money. Each shoemaker in each locality is in competition
with every other shoemaker in the same locality, each hatter
is in competition with every other hatter, each clothier with every
other clothier, all offering their wares for units of money. In this
universal and perpetual competition for money, that number of
shoemakers that can supply the demand for shoes at the smallest
average price (excellence of quality being taken into account) will
fix the market value of shoes in money; and conversely, will fix the
value of money in shoes. So with the hatters as to hats, so with the
tailors as to clothes, and so with those engaged in all other occupations
as to the products respectively of their labor.</p>


<p class="caption">NO ALTERNATIVE FOR MONEY.</p>

<p>The transcendant importance of money, and the constant pressure
of the demand for it may be realized by comparing its utility with
that of any other force that contributes to human welfare.</p>

<p>In all the broad range of articles that, in a state of civilization,
are needed by man, the only absolutely indispensable thing is money.
For everything else there is some substitute&mdash;some alternative; for
money there is none. Among articles of food, if beef rise in price,
the demand for it will diminish, as a certain proportion of the people
will resort to other forms of food. If, by reason of its continued scarcity,
beef continue to rise, the demand will further diminish, until
finally it may altogether cease and center on something else.  So in
the matter of clothing. If any one fabric become scarce, and consequently
dear, the demand will diminish, and, if the price continue
rising, it is only a question of time for the demand to cease and be
transferred to some alternative.</p>

<p>But this can not be the case with money. It can never be driven
out of use. There is not, and there never can be, any substitute for
it. It may become so scarce that one dollar at the end of a decade
may buy ten times as much as at the beginning; that is to say, it
may cost in labor or commodities ten times as much to get it, but at
whatever cost, the people must have it. Without money the demands
of civilization could not be supplied.</p>

<p>Money was the most potent instrumentality in the evolution of
society from a low to a high plane of civilization. It is valueless
to man in isolation. It is indispensable to man in organized society.
It is as necessary for the proprietary distribution of wealth
as railroads and steamships are to its physical distribution. The
aggregate force of the demand for money in any country depends
upon the numbers of the population; with a stationary population
the demand is steady, with an increasing population the demand
increases, and in order to maintain undisturbed the equation
of supply and demand the volume of money should be increased in
at least a ratio corresponding to that of the increase of population.</p>

<p>There are certain circumstances that to some extent disturb
the relations between population and money supply, such as the
broadening of the areas of population, and the multiplication of
money centers. These circumstances might render necessary a larger
percentage of increase in the money volume than would be indicated
by the increase of the population.</p>

<p>But under any circumstances the smallest money-increase that
will suffice to maintain the equity of time contracts is an increase
corresponding to the increase of numbers of the population.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p075" id="Page_p075">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Under conditions of unvarying demand and unvarying supply
the value of the unit of money would be unvarying. If as population
and demand increase the supply of money be proportionately increased,
there is no possibility of a change in the value of the unit
of money.</p>

<p>The constant and unceasing effort to exchange services and all
forms of property, which have but limited command over the objects
of human desire, for money, that sole instrumentality that has unlimited
command over such objects, is, and ever will be, eager, intense,
and unwavering.</p>

<p>With population and consequent demand rapidly increasing how
do the advocates of the gold standard expect to increase the money
volume of the country in this proportion, while the yield of gold, instead
of increasing in proportion to demand, is every day becoming
less and less capable of meeting the requirements of the arts alone?</p>


<p class="caption">THE QUANTITY OF MONEY IN CIRCULATION SHOULD INCREASE IN A RATIO NOT LESS
THAN THE RATIO OF INCREASE OF POPULATION.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that if the population of a country be increased
by any given percentage there will be a proportionate increase in the
demand for all articles that supply human needs. If the population
increases by 3 per cent., there will be needed 3 per cent. more house-room,
3 per cent. more furniture, 3 per cent. more food, 3 per cent.
more of all things that enter into consumption. These things can
only be got by a demand first made on money. Then why not 3 per
cent. more money?</p>

<p>The present monetary circulation of this country including gold,
silver, and paper, is represented to be $1,700,000,000. As our population
doubles in thirty years, the rate of increase is 3<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></small> per cent.</p>

<p>If the money volume be not increased by a proportion at least as
great as this, the true relation between the supply of money and the
demand for it will not be maintained. The demand increasing as
the population increases, while the supply either does not increase
at all or increases in a degree incommensurate with the demand, the
money volume shrinks and the purchasing power of the unit becomes
greater by reason of the increased keenness of competition to
get it. This is but another mode of stating that the prices of all
products of human labor decline. Prices falling, business ceases to
be profitable, stores and work-shops close, and men are relegated to
idleness.</p>


<p class="caption">THE QUANTITATIVE THEORY OF MONEY&mdash;THE VALUE OF EACH DOLLAR DEPENDS ON
THE NUMBER OF DOLLARS OUT.</p>

<p>Thus by the universal competition to get it the value of the dollar
is made to depend upon the number of dollars that are out. This
is a principle that lies at the very foundation of the science of money.
The law, stated broadly, is that the value of each unit of money in
any country at any given time depends on the whole number of units
in circulation in that country. The larger the number of units out,
population remaining the same, the less must be the value of each
unit; the smaller the number of units out, population remaining
the same, the greater the value of each.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the variance sometimes found between the premises
and the conclusions of economic writers, there is no economist
of repute who does not admit this to be a fundamental principle.</p>

<p>On the theory I have propounded therefore 3<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></small> per cent. of
$1,700,000,000, or $56,000,000, is the minimum amount of money that
should be added to the currency of this country during the present
year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p076" id="Page_p076">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Assuming the population of to-day to be 65,000,000 and the ratio
of its annual increase 3<small><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></small> per cent., the population of next year will
be 67,166,600. The percentage of monetary increase to be provided
for that year should therefore be baaed on the increased number.
And so on for each succeeding year.</p>

<p>I have thought best to collate a variety of citations from the most
distinguished authorities on financial economy to support my contention
that, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the value of each dollar depends on the
number of dollars in circulation.</p>

<p>John Locke, in his "Considerations," etc., published in 1690, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Money, while the same quantity of it is passing up and down the kingdom in
trade, is really a standing measure of the falling and rising value of other things
in reference to one another, and the alteration in price is truly in them only. But
if you increase or lessen the quantity of money current in traffic in any place, then
the alteration of value is in the money.</p></div>

<p>Locke further said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The value of money in any one country, is the present quantity of the current
money in that country, in proportion to the present trade.</p></div>

<p>The historian, Hume, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is not difficult to perceive that it is the total quantity of the money in circulation,
in any country, which determines what portion of that quantity shall exchange
for a certain portion of the goods or commodities of that country.</p>

<p>It is the proportion between the circulating money and the commodities in the
market which determines the price.</p></div>

<p>Fichte says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The amount of money current in a state represents everything that is purchasable
on the surface of the state. If the quantity of purchasable articles increases

<p>James Mill, in his treatise on political economy, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And again, in whatever degree, therefore, the quantity of money is increased or

<p>John Stuart Mill (Political Economy) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The value of money, other things being the same, varies inversely as its quantity;
every increase of quantity lowering the value, and every diminution raising
it in a ratio exactly equivalent.</p></div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Alterations in the cost of the production of the precious metals do not act upon
the value of money, except just in proportion as they increase or diminish its
quantity.</p></div>

<p>Ricardo (reply to Bosanquet) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The value of money in any country is determined by the amount existing. * * *</p>

<p>That commodities would rise or fall in price in proportion to the increase or diminution
of money, I assume as a fact that is incontrovertible. * * *</p></div>

<p>Ricardo further says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There can exist no depreciation in money but from excess; however debased a
coinage may become, it will preserve its mint value; that is to say, it will pass in
circulation for the intrinsic value of the bullion which it ought to contain, provided
it be not in too great abundance.</p></div>

<p>In this case Ricardo's illustration is the supposed case of a country
actually using one million gold pieces each containing 100 grains.
He maintains that they would be of the same purchasing power, if
the Government took out 1 grain, or even 50 grains, the quantity remaining
the same, but that if, from the grains so deducted, an addi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p077" id="Page_p077">[77]</a></span>tional
number of pieces were struck, a corresponding depreciation
would result.</p>

<p>William Huskisson ("The Depreciation of the Currency," 1819),
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If the quantity of gold in a country whose currency consists of gold should be
increased in any given proportion, the quantity of other articles and the demand
for them remaining the same, the value of any given commodity measured in the
coin of that country would be increased in the same proportion.</p></div>

<p>Sir James Graham says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The value of money is in the inverse ratio of its quantity; the supply of commodities
remaining the same.</p></div>

<p>Torrens, in his work on Political Economy, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Gold is a commodity governed, as all other commodities are governed, by the
law of supply and demand. If the value of all other commodities, in relation to
gold, rises and falls as their quantities diminish or increase, the value of gold in
relation to commodities must rise and fall as its quantity is diminished or increased.</p></div>

<p>Wolowski says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The sum total of the precious metals is reckoned at 50 milliards, one-half gold
and one-half silver. If, by a stroke of the pen, they suppress one of these metals
in the monetary service, they double the demand for the other metal, to the ruin
of all debtors.</p></div>

<p>Cernuschi says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The purchasing power of money is in direct proportion to the volume of money
existing.</p></div>

<p>Prof. Francis A. Walker, in his work on "Money" (page 57),
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The value of money in any country is determined by the amount existing.</p>

<p>Its [money's] power of acquisition depends not on its substance, but on its
quantity. [Paulus, author of the Pandects, sixth century.]</p></div>

<p>Professor De Colange, in the American Cyclopedia of Commerce,
article on "Money," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The rate at which money exchanges for other things is determined by its quantity. * * *</p>

<p>Supposing the amount of trade and mode of circulation to remain stationary, if
the quantity of money be increased, its value will fall, and the price of other commodities
will proportionally rise, as the latter will then exchange against a greater
amount of money; if, on the other hand, the quantity of money be reduced, its
value will be raised, and prices in a corresponding degree diminished, as commodities
will then have to be exchanged for a less amount of money. * * *</p>

<p>In whatever degree, therefore, the quantity of money is increased or diminished,
other things remaining the same, in that same proportion the value of the whole
and of every part is reciprocally diminished or increased.</p></div>

<p>A curtailment of the volume of money in a country will, <i>ceteris
paribus</i>, increase the value of the money of that country. All the
authorities agree that this law applies to all forms of money, whatever
the material; so that it applies to paper money with precisely
the same force that it applies to metallic money.</p>

<p>Mr. Stanley Jevons, in his work on "Money and the Mechanism of
Exchange," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is plenty of evidence to prove that an inconvertible paper money, if carefully
limited in quantity, can retain its full value. Such was the case with the
Bank of England notes for several years after the suspension of specie payments
in 1797, and such is the case with the present notes of the Bank of France.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Gallatin said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>If in a country which wants and possesses a metallic currency of seventy millions
of dollars, a paper currency to the same amount should be substituted, the
seventy millions in gold and silver, being no longer wanted for that purpose, will
be exported, and the returns may be converted into a productive capital, and add
an equal amount to the wealth of the country.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p078" id="Page_p078">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>In his Proposal for an Economic and Secure Currency Ricardo
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A well regulated paper currency is so great an improvement in commerce, that
I should greatly regret if prejudice should induce us to return to a system of less
utility. The introduction of the precious metals for the purposes of money may
with truth be considered as one or the most important steps toward the improvement
of commerce and the arts of civilized life; but it is no less true, that with the
advancement of knowledge and science, we discover that it would be another improvement
to banish them again from the employment to which, during a less enlightened
period, they had been so advantageously applied.</p></div>

<p>Mr. J. R. McCulloch, in commenting on the principles of money
laid down by Ricardo, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He examined the circumstances which determine the value of money * * *
and be showed that * * * its value will depend on the extent to which it may
be issued compared with the demand. This is a principle of great importance;
for, it shows that intrinsic worth is not necessary to a currency, and that provided
the supply of paper notes, declared to be a legal tender, be sufficiently limited,
their value may be maintained on a par with the value of gold, or raised to any
higher level. If, therefore, it were practicable to devise a plan for preserving the
value of paper on a level with that of gold, without making it convertible into
coin at the pleasure of the holder, the heavy expense of a metallic currency would
be saved.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that if there were perfect security that the power of
issuing paper money would not be abused; that is, if there were perfect security
for its being issued in such quantities, as to preserve its value relatively to the
mass of circulating commodities nearly equal, the precious metals might be
entirely dispensed with, not only as a circulating medium, but also as a standard
to which to refer the value of paper.</p>

<p>In adopting a paper circulation&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">Says Lord Overstone&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">we must unavoidably depend for a maintenance of its due value upon the
adoption of a strict and judicious rule for the regulation of its amount.</p></div>

<p>Lord Overstone further declared that:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The value of the paper currency results from its being kept at the same amount
the metallic currency would have been.</p></div>

<p>Alexander Baring, in his evidence before the secret committee of
the House of Lords in 1819, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The reduction of paper would produce all those effects which arise from the reduction
in the amount of money in any country.</p></div>

<p>Prof. F. A. Walker says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Let me repeat, money is to be known by its doing a certain work. Money is
not gold, though gold may be money; sometimes gold is money, and sometimes it
is not. Money is no one thing, no group of many things having any material property
in common. On the contrary, anything may be money; and anything, in
a given time and place, is money which then and there performs a certain function.
Always and everywhere that which does the money-work is the money-thing.</p></div>

<p>Sir Archibald Alison says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The suspension of specie payment in 1797, making bank notes a legal tender
receivable for taxes by providing Great Britain with an adequate internal currency,
averted the catastrophe then so general upon the Continent, and gave it
at the same time an extraordinary degree of prosperity. Such was the commencement
of the paper system in Great Britain, which ultimately produced such astonishing
effects, and brought the struggle [of the Napoleonic wars] to a triumphant
close.</p></div>


<p class="caption">THE TRUE MONEY STANDARD.</p>

<p>The true money standard of any country is not the material of
which the money is made. The standard is not a concrete object,
but a numerical relation. It is the relation between the number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p079" id="Page_p079">[79]</a></span>
units composing the monetary circulation of the country and the
numbers of the population.</p>

<p>It is the legal-tender function that constitutes money. It is the
power which the law imparts to any material to pay debts and
liquidate obligations. It can not for a moment be doubted that the
money function, being conferred by the supreme authority, is the
all-sufficient guarantee of the money value. There is no necessity
for re-enforcing that value with any inferior value that may attach
to the material on which the money stamp is placed. The money
function is immeasurably the most important that can be conferred
by society upon any material, and it is absurd to urge that that
function is not of itself sufficient for the maintenance of the value
of money. All the value that money can possibly have&mdash;the totality
of value that can exist in the shape of money in any country&mdash;will
attach to anything upon which the sovereign authority stamps it,
whether the material on which the stamp is placed be gold, silver,
paper, or anything else. Legislators or executive officers of the
Government, by increasing or decreasing the volume of money, correspondingly
decrease or increase the value of each unit of that
money. For no matter how many or how few the units may be, the
total value of the money of the country will be comprised within
the total number of those units. A change in the number of the
units effects a proportionate change in the value of each unit, and
whatever the value of the unit may be, it is of the utmost importance
that that value should remain undisturbed.</p>

<p>It is absurd to maintain that a gold unit, which, as time goes on,
is constantly increasing in purchasing power; is a better unit than
a unit of any other material that maintains unchanging value
through time.</p>

<p>Whenever the business of the country accommodates itself to a
given number of units, the only question for the Government to
deal with is to maintain that value as free from disturbance as
possible; and according to all authorities on political economy that
can only be done by increasing or decreasing the number of units in
circulation in accordance with the demands of increasing or decreasing
population.</p>

<p>If it be admitted that one of the most important offices of government
is to see that the equities are preserved between its citizens
(and if this be not so, to what purpose are our courts of equity
instituted?), then it can not be denied that it is one of the highest
offices of government to see that money, which measures all
equities, and which must for all time continue to be the principal
measure in the service of civilized society, shall be of unchanging
value. It is impossible to secure this characteristic of uniformity
in the value of money if we are to select as the only material on
which to stamp the money function a substance whose yearly production
is becoming more and more limited, and the prospect of
whose sufficient yield becomes less and less encouraging.</p>


<p class="caption">IF SILVER REMAIN DEMONETIZED AND GOLD CONTINUE DECREASING, WHERE IS THE
WORLD'S FUTURE MONEY SUPPLY TO COME FROM?</p>

<p>If the distinguished authorities I have quoted are correct, that a
diminution of the volume of money increases the value of the
money unit&mdash;which is but another form of stating that it lowers
prices and produces stagnation, distress, and discontent,&mdash;what good
reason can be offered by the advocates of the gold standard for confining
the business of this rapidly growing country to a basis of
gold, when it is well known that the entire stocks of gold and silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p080" id="Page_p080">[80]</a></span>
together are now insufficient to serve the purpose of the world's
money, and have to be supplemented and re-enforced by large issues
of paper notes? Do they not reflect that the production of gold is
constantly diminishing and is likely to continue to diminish? And
do they not know that our population is growing at the rate of
over 3 per cent. per annum and will double in thirty years? Do
they mean that the money volume which serves a population of
65,000,000, and is far below the needs of that population, will suffice
for the 130,000,000 of the next generation? To be sure, if we are to
take no note of prices, the question is a simple one.</p>

<p>But prices must be taken into account. The entire money question
is one of prices. When it is said that money is scarce, what is
meant is that business is depressed and that money is difficult to
get, at the present range of prices. Should prices fall 25 per cent.
money would be found plentiful enough to conduct exchange at the
lower range. But when prices fall, goods sell below cost, business
is unprofitable, workshops are closed, and men are thrown into idleness.
If lowering prices do not affect injuriously either the business
or the prosperity of the country, then it makes no difference what
the volume of money may be; a small amount will meet the requirements
as well as a large amount. In that case, the gold standard is
as good as any.</p>

<p>But if gold alone is sufficient to bear all the enormous monetary
burdens of the Western world, why do the advocates of the gold
standard admit the necessity for any more circulation? To be logical,
instead of favoring an increase of credit money, which has always
lurking within it an element of danger to the business of the
community, they should demand the retirement of the $347,000,000 of
greenbacks and the $350,000,000 of coined silver, and base the business
of the country exclusively on what they call "honest money."
If that should be done all that could happen would be a fall in prices.
Judging by the experience of the past it would not be surprising if
the next move of the gold-standard men would be an agitation for
the retirement and cancellation of the greenbacks. Such a movement
is fully in harmony with the opinions of the gold-standard
advocates for the past twenty years. Indeed, the Secretary of the
Treasury who took charge of the finances at the opening of the last
Administration, himself a banker, recommended the demonetization
of the greenbacks almost as vigorously as he opposed silver.</p>


<p class="caption">MONEY VALUABLE ONLY FOR THE IMPORTANT SERVICE IT PERFORMS.</p>

<p>Money is valuable rather for the service which it performs than
for the material of which it is composed.</p>

<p>When we consider the transcendantly important character of the
service which money performs&mdash;when we reflect that, without it,
the achievement of an advanced civilization would be impossible,
we can not escape the conclusion that, compared with the value of
that service, the commodity value of any material on which the
money function may be stamped is too trifling to merit serious
attention.</p>

<p>This will be made clear by reflection on the necessities of the situation.</p>

<p>So long as society chooses to maintain the automatic or metallic
money-system, it must be obvious that to escape the evils that would
result from a sudden and overwhelming increase in the supply of the
money-material as compared with the entire stock in existence, and
the infinitely more serious evils that would result from a wholly insufficient
yearly addition to that stock, it must have on hand an enor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p081" id="Page_p081">[81]</a></span>mous
accumulation of the metals on which the stamp is placed. It
must be manifest that no material would be fit for universal acceptance
for so important a function as money unless there were available
so great a quantity of it that no sudden shock could be inflicted on
society by ordinary fluctuations in the current yield, or in the current
consumption in the arts.</p>

<p>But, in the nature of things, a supply sufficient to effect that result
would be so enormous as practically to destroy the market value of
the material as a mere commodity if the money function and use
were withdrawn from it.</p>


<p class="caption">THE MONEY DEMAND, NOT THE COMMODITY DEMAND, THAT GIVES GOLD ITS VALUE.</p>

<p>Mr. Giffen the statistician of the London Board of Trade, in an
article recently published in an English magazine, berating and
deriding the bi-metallists, maintains that it is not the demand for gold
as money, but for gold as a commodity, to be used in the arts, that determines
its value.</p>

<p>To prove his case, Mr. Giffen states that the supply of gold is about
$95,000,000 per annum, the annual demand for the arts $60,000,000, or
about two-thirds of the annual supply; while the demand for money
is only $35,000,000, or about one-third that supply. He therefore
argues that the art demand, being the greater of the two, contributes
more largely to the maintenance of the value of gold than does the
demand for that article as money. It is hardly necessary to point
out the absurdity of this claim.</p>

<p>The commodity demand in any one year is not made upon the current
year's supply, but upon the entire amount in existence, which,
is estimated to be about $4,000,000,000. If the demand for the arts
entirely ceased, would the addition, to the money volume, of the
$60,000,000 now used in the arts produce any appreciable effect on
the value of the $4,000,000,000 in existence?</p>

<p>On the other hand, what is the demand on gold for the money use?
All the labor and all the salable property of the western world are
constantly offered in exchange for it. It is a moderate estimate to
assume that each dollar is earned, demanded, and paid once a week,
or fifty times in each year. This constitutes a total annual money
demand of $200,000,000,000, compared with which colossal sum how
inconsequential is the commodity demand of $60,000,000 in maintaining
the value of gold.</p>

<p>The amount of gold annually used in the arts is not very definitely
ascertained, but in 1886 it was estimated by the then Director of the
United States Mint to be $46,000,000 per annum. Mr. Giffen estimated
it at $60,000,000. It is my opinion that the arts forage on the money-stock
of gold to the extent of about the entire annual yield. The
bullion or commodity value of that metal being determined by its
money value, whoever desires to use it for any purpose other than
money, takes the bullion at its coinage value, or else melts up the
coin.</p>

<p>Were gold demonetized and deprived of its money function, and
its demand confined solely to that arising from its adaptability for
various other purposes, the present stock of that metal on hand and
in use as money would, according to the estimates of the director of
the mint, supply the art demand for more than seventy-five years to
come. But, assuming that the estimate of the Director of the Mint
is too low, and that my own is nearer the truth, there is at least fifty
years' supply on hand. Were there fifty or seventy-five years' supply
of any other commodity on hand in the market, what would be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p082" id="Page_p082">[82]</a></span>
commercial value of that commodity? What would be the value of
copper, of brass, or of iron, if there were fifty or seventy-five years'
supply of either of those metals in the market for disposal at one
time? Nobody can pretend that any commodity of which there is
an available supply on hand equivalent to the whole demand for
fifty or seventy-five years can have any but the most trifling value.</p>

<p>Contrary, therefore, to the generally received conviction that the
commodity demand is the dominating force in fixing the value of
gold I maintain and insist that the commodity demand, if entering
into the account at all, is insignificant. It is the supremely important
<i>money</i>-demand, as correlated to the supply, that fixes the value
of all money of every description whatsoever.</p>

<p>The demand for gold as a commodity is limited and fluctuating,
but when that metal is invested by law with the higher function of
money, and thus constituted a common denominator of all values,
that limited and fluctuating demand is changed to an unlimited and
constant one, which fixes its value for other and inferior uses. If
the commodity-demand for gold were, as many believe it to be,
essential to its acceptance as money, it would be a great misfortune
to society. The happiness and prosperity of the world, if not wholly
dependent upon, are largely influenced by, steadiness in the value
of money, and this can not exist without steadiness in its volume.
Whatever demand exists for gold as a commodity can only affect the
volume of money injuriously&mdash;that is to say, by decreasing it. The
admonition of history is that a deficiency in the money-supply is
more probable, and infinitely more to be feared than an excess, and
this deficiency is, in great measure, caused by the insidious and constant
encroachment, upon the precious metals, of demands for them
for other than the money use. When we contrast the magnitude of
the world's interests and equities, which rest on steadiness in the
value of money, with the comparative unimportance of the uses of
the metals as commodities, it becomes apparent that the subjection
of the value of money to disturbance from the demands for gilded
signs, looking-glasses, bangles and breast-pins, is an evil for which
society is but poorly compensated by the benefits derived from such
uses.</p>

<p>Whatever other quality gold may posses than as the bearer of the
money function is inconsistent with the healthful and proper exercise
of the task assigned it as such. Whenever any portion of the metal
is used for any other purpose than money it destroys the money and
thus changes the value of every unit of money in circulation, for,
at already stated&mdash;other things remaining unchanged&mdash;the value
of each dollar depends on the number of dollars that are out. Without
forewarning, and with out knowledge on the part of the people,
large amounts of the money volume, on which so infinite a number of
equities rest, and on the basis of which all debts and time contracts
have been entered into, are, as it were, surreptitiously abstracted
and appropriated to other and always inferior uses, for by far the
highest and noblest use of any material upon which the money function
has been conferred, is the money use. No other use can possibly
be so high or so noble as that of maintaining all equities undisturbed.</p>

<p>It seems unworthy a highly developed civilization which, as to
all subjects other than money, regulates its affairs by the application
of intelligence, and bases its policies upon exact data, scientifically
ascertained and correctly applied, to depend for its money system
upon the accidents, make-shifts, and expedients to which primitive
society, by reason of the limitation of its powers and the undeveloped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p083" id="Page_p083">[83]</a></span>
condition of the human mind and hand, was compelled to resort. If
the quantitative theory of money be correct&mdash;if the money standard
be, as I insist it is, a steady and duly proportioned numerical relation
existing between the units of population and units of money&mdash;it
is the duty of society and government to see that as far as practicable
that principle is put into operation.</p>

<p>The history of the production of the precious metals from the remotest
ages demonstrates that under the automatic system of money
this can only be effected by the unrestricted coinage of, and conferring
the full legal-tender function on, both metals.</p>


<p class="caption">THE PROPOSITION THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD LEND MONEY ON THE SECURITY
OF REAL ESTATE.</p>

<p>If a change in the whole number of money units in circulation
relatively to population and business do not affect the value of each
unit, then no objection can be found to the proposition recently presented
in the Senate by the distinguished Senator from California,
which created some surprise among Senators. The resolution of
that Senator contemplates a loan by the Government to holders of
real estate based upon the security of the property; and the issue
of a large amount of Treasury notes for that purpose. Certainly, if
a dollar, in order to perform properly the money function, must have
in it or back of it a dollar's worth of material, there can be no
safer security found than that suggested by the Senator from California,
namely, the arable land of the United States.</p>

<p>It is the most absolutely secure of all securities; it can neither
run away nor be stolen, it can not be burnt up, lost, or destroyed.</p>

<p>Arable land is, in and of itself, capable of supplying all basic wants,
and must be always in demand, while gold, so far as concerns any
use to which it is, or can be applied, might be dispensed with altogether,
with scarcely any inconvenience to society.</p>

<p>Certainly money based on land would seem to be better than
money based on gold. Senators who are sticklers for so-called "intrinsic
value" money, and "full-value" money, should be found
supporting that proposition. But it must, on reflection, be obvious
that, other things remaining unchanged, whenever the total number
of units of money (or dollars) in the circulation of a country increases,
the value of each unit will decrease. It is an axiom of political economy
that no amount of increase in the number of units of money in a
country increases the aggregate value of the money of that country.</p>

<p>The aggregate value of the money in circulation in a country, can,
<i>ceteris paribus</i>, be increased only by an increase of population and
business, that is to say, by an increase in the demand for it.</p>

<p>If, without increase of population, the money of a country be increased
from, say, $1,000,000,000 to $2,000,000,000, the effect would
be not to add to the aggregate value of the money of the country,
but to decrease the value or purchasing power of each unit of the
money, so that it would take ten dollars to buy what had before
cost but five.</p>


<p class="caption">GOLD A FETICH&mdash;DEMAND FOR A STANDARD OF JUSTICE.</p>

<p>The history of the world affords no example of a money system regulated
by human prescience and intelligent calculation. It is not too
much to say that the money system of the world&mdash;the most important
associative instrumentality of civilization, in so far as it is not
controlled for their own advantage by the creditor classes&mdash;is practically
the result of accident. We are even less logical than the ancients,
for they availed themselves of the entire supply of money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p084" id="Page_p084">[84]</a></span>
possible to their civilization and development. They used the full
yield of both silver and gold, while we, in order to line the pockets
of a privileged caste of money-lenders, reduce the money volume to
the lowest possible minimum by discarding one of those metals and
making all debts payable in the other.</p>

<p>Gold has been erected into a fetich by methods familiar to the
pagan priesthood, who forbade investigation of the claims of their
idol to the superstitious veneration of their followers. The quality
of a universal standard claimed for gold has been set up by the
classes which, like that priesthood, had interests to be served by
the superstition. All things else may be subjected to the test of
reason and argument, but the slightest approach to a scrutiny of
the claims of gold as a much-vaunted universal standard of valuation
has been repelled by interested casuists and sophists who constitute
the sacred guard of the temple of the idol.</p>

<p>The people of this country, Mr. President, begin very seriously to
doubt the sacredness of a so-called standard by which they have been
robbed of thousands of millions of dollars&mdash;a standard that despoils
and impoverishes the toiling masses, in order to swell the plethoric
pockets of the privileged few. From all parts of the Republic we
learn that the people have become aroused on this subject, that they
have discovered gold to be a standard, not of valuation, but of spoliation
and confiscation.</p>

<p>The world at large shares to a great extent in the doubts entertained
by the people of this country as to the orthodoxy of the continuing
worship of gold. Throughout all Europe the suspicion is
beginning to make itself felt, among those who have no personal
interest at stake, that the constantly appreciating value of this
metal bodes no good to society, however advantageous it may be to
the moneyed classes, and especially the money lenders. It begins
to be feared that there may be too long a persistence in this artificial
standard, and that the pressure upon the people, in the fall of prices
and the increase of the burden of debt and of taxes, which multiply
with time, may have serious consequences upon public order. The
stock of gold, never half enough to meet the wants of the people
anywhere, is year by year being drawn upon more and more for use
in the arts, while the yield from the mines is decreasing, and giving
no promise of any material increase from any quarter.</p>

<p>The pressing need of the time, the standard for which the people
are calling, is a standard of equity, a standard of justice, a standard
that shall measure fairly and impartially the rights of both parties to
a contract, that will not wrongfully and stealthily add to the burden
of the obligation on either side, that will not, under the guise of fair
dealing, rob one of the parties for the benefit of the other. The first
indispensable step to a realization of that standard is the full restoration
of silver to its rightful position as a part of the money of the
world.</p>

<p>In any discussion of the question, it would be uncharitable not
to make allowance for the force, on many conscientious minds, of
what, to the free and unprejudiced inquirer, can only be regarded
as an absurd and meaningless superstition, which, notwithstanding
the advance of thought in other directions, still persists in disarranging
the industries and vexing the civilization of an enlightened
age. It is to the strength of this obdurate superstition that we must
ascribe the horror with which many minds contemplate the possible
loss to the country of a part of its gold.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p085" id="Page_p085">[85]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">FEAR OF THE OUTFLOW OF GOLD.</p>

<p>Any prospect of the outflow of gold is regarded as the opening of
a veritable Pandora's box, from which must issue forth all the evils
that can afflict mankind.</p>

<p>It is to this fear, no doubt conscientiously entertained, that we
must attribute the declaration of the President of the United States
that we do not dare to tread on the edge of so dangerous a peril. It
is not difficult to make the statement, but it will be very difficult to
prove that we stand on the edge of any peril whatever, if most or
even all our gold should go.</p>

<p>We heard this same apprehension expressed, and with equal, if not
greater, force twelve years ago, when the silver question was before
this body. We were then assured by the ablest of our so-called
"financiers" that the country would be denuded of its gold and that
all manner of dreadful catastrophies would result. The prospect was
represented to be appalling, although I do not remember that any
reasons were given to show how or why gold should leave the country,
nor that any statement was made as to exactly how this country
would suffer if it did leave.</p>

<p>For my own part, Mr. President, I regard it as a matter of very
little consequence whether gold goes out or not. Certainly if, in
order to retain gold, we must sacrifice justice, then I say let gold go.</p>

<p>It is not of so much consequence that we should retain gold for the
benefit of a small coterie of importers as that we should preserve
the equity of time contracts between the millions of our own people
who import no foreign goods. It is monstrous to think of violating
all equities in time transactions&mdash;and nine out of every ten of our
domestic business transactions are of that character&mdash;for the absurd
and inconsequent purpose of keeping in this country some particular
commodity, whether it be designated as money or otherwise.</p>

<p>The hoarding or the outflow of gold is a hardship when, under the
law, somebody is obliged to have it, as was the case during the war,
when gold alone would pay duties on imports. Combinations to hoard
gold at that time frequently involved great loss to the importer.
But thanks to the silver legislation of 1878 and other legislation making
our Treasury notes receivable for customs dues, no damage could
now result from any attempted corner in gold.</p>

<p>The creditors of this country never can convince the enterprising
and energetic people who form the debtor class that it is to our interest
that a certain material shall be kept in the country as money,
if the expense of keeping it is that the debtors shall continue to be
despoiled as they have been for the past fifteen years.</p>

<p>If we can only retain gold at the expense of steady and unwavering
prices, and at the expense of a steady and unchanging value in
money, then the quicker gold goes out the better. The constantly
increasing value of gold by reason of its increasing scarcity means
the constantly increasing burden of all debt, and involves the final
absorption of all the property of the country by the creditor classes.
Under the operation of the present system, by which prices are constantly
falling and money is constantly increasing in value, the
surplus earnings of the people are flowing in a steady stream into
the vaults of money-lending institutions, and into the pockets of
creditors.</p>

<p>In a very intelligent article published in a late number of an influential
magazine&mdash;the Political Science Quarterly&mdash;there is the
significant statement, apparently derived from the best sources, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p086" id="Page_p086">[86]</a></span>
in the year 1879-'80, one-half of all the mortgages in the State of
Indiana were foreclosed.</p>

<p>It were better for society that property should at once be confiscated
than that the great masses of the people in every community
should have to struggle through years of painful and exhausting effort
in the face of constantly falling prices and then in a large
percentage of cases to lose their property at last. But this can not
be avoided so long as we attempt to keep up what is called the gold
standard. It is a necessary consequence of the gold standard that we
shall have the scale of prices that obtains in gold standard countries
If the presence of gold in this country is to destroy our people, who
doubts that it should go? If its presence is to result in the destruction
of equity and justice, who doubts that it should go?</p>

<p>Nearly every witness who testified before the secret committee of
the House of Commons in 1857 agreed that gold could only be held
by paralysing the business of the country. It is estimated by witnesses
who testified before that committee, that in the panic of 1847,
in Great Britain, the property of the country, by reason of the measures
rendered necessary to maintain the single gold standard, was depreciated
$1,500,000,000. I commend that report to the careful and
serious perusal of the advocates of the single gold standard in this
country.</p>

<p>Among the witnesses before the committee were John Stuart Mill,
Lord Overstone, and many other men distinguished in the world of
letters and finance. I am informed by the Librarian of Congress that
there is but one copy of the work in the United States. It would be
well worth while for Congress to order a number of copies of it
printed, for there is no work with which I am acquainted that contains
so much practical information as to the working of the single
gold standard. According to the testimony taken before that committee,
the experience of Great Britain since 1819 shows that gold
alone, even when re-enforced by paper money convertible exclusively
into gold, instead of being a beneficent instrument of valuation, has
proved a cruel instrument of injustice.</p>

<p>A brief consideration of the causes which affect the movement of
gold will not be out of place in this connection.</p>


<p class="caption">RATIONALE OF THE MOVEMENT OF GOLD.</p>

<p>Why is it that gold leaves country and goes to another? For
one reason only&mdash;the advantage of its owner. Whenever he can make
a profit by sending it out, the gold goes; and the period when that
profit can be made is indicated when the prices of goods that are internationally
dealt in are either rising in the country which it leaves
or falling in the country to which it goes. It is only to pay for importable
goods that gold ever leaves the country in which the owner
resides. Being an international money, and receivable everywhere
at its full face value, gold loses nothing by transfer; hence it is
sent wherever it will for the time being have the greatest purchasing
power.</p>

<p>Whenever the general range of prices in this country of commodities
internationally dealt in becomes than higher than the general range
of the same commodities abroad, it is manifest that then gold can
used to advantage by purchasing those articles abroad and selling
them here. If the gold that goes out goes from stock that has been
hoarded here, the outflow has no immediate or direct effect upon
prices in this country, although, by increasing or "inflating" the
volume of money abroad it assists in raising prices there, and thus
tends to secure for our exported products a better price in the foreign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p087" id="Page_p087">[87]</a></span>
market. But if the gold goes from the amount that is in active circulation
here, and if the void created by this outflow is not filled
with other forms of money, such as silver, or paper, it results in a reduction
of the volume of money in actual use in this country, while
at the same time increasing the volume of money abroad.</p>

<p>This increase in the foreign money stock causes a rise of prices
abroad, while the corresponding reduction of our currency causes
a proportionate fall of prices here, hence there is a constant tendency
to an equilibrium of prices of all articles of international
commerce.</p>

<p>No outflow of gold would follow a rise of prices here except in so
far as that rise affected articles internationally dealt in. No rise of
prices of such articles as we do not import would tend in any way
to drive out gold. If, for example, raw cotton should increase in
price in this country, that fact would not tend to drive out gold, because
we do not import raw cotton. But should the prices of articles
of manufactured cotton rise here above what those same articles could
be bought for in any foreign country our merchants would send abroad
for them, provided that, after paying the freight charges and customs
dues, they could make a profit on them.</p>

<p>So, also, if crockery-ware were made in this country, and its price
should rise to, say, double the present price, then, instead of buying
the American, or home-made article, our crockery merchants, finding
that they could buy in England, France, or Germany cheaper than
they could buy in this country, would decline to buy the American
crockery, and would send abroad for any article, provided that, after
paying freight charges and customs dues, they could sell it here at a
profit. That would tend to increase the shipments of gold to foreign
countries.</p>

<p>That an outflow of gold does not follow from a rise of general
prices, but only of prices of articles of international trade, is manifest
from the fact that if land becomes cheap in other countries, gold
does not leave this country to buy it. When real estate is cheap in
Brazil, or Australia, or in Germany, France, or even England, the
owners of gold in this country do not send it abroad to make purchases
of real estate.</p>

<p>So wages of labor may rise in this country, or compensation for all
manner of services that must be performed here, and gold would not
leave as a consequence. But if cloth were cheaper&mdash;quality considered,&mdash;in
England, France, or Germany, or at the remotest ends of
the earth,&mdash;than in this country, our merchants would send gold for it
in order to sell it here at a profit.</p>

<p>Altogether too much importance is attached to the possession of a
large stock of gold, unless that stock form part of the active circulation
of the country. So long as it remains in circulation it sustains
prices and develops industry and internal commerce. But the
tendency of gold being to find the most profitable field for operation,
its continued presence in the country can never be relied upon.</p>

<p>When we take gold from other countries prices in those countries
fall, owing to the reduction of the volume of money there; and owing
also to the action of the foreign banks in immediately raising their
rates of discount on commercial paper and suddenly calling loans. As
there is less money left in such country with which to pay for commodities,
we are obliged to accept lower prices for the products we
ship to it.</p>

<p>The larger the stock of gold, therefore, accumulated by us the lower,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p088" id="Page_p088">[88]</a></span>
necessarily, must be the price which we can receive for our surplus
agricultural products.</p>

<p>In order to maintain parity between the metals, it is not necessary
for us to have all the gold we now have; $200,000,000, or even
$100,000,000 of gold, would maintain that parity. The parity between
the metals can never be broken until all the gold leaves, and
provided we retain one or two hundred million, the rest can not be
placed more advantageously than where our languishing surplus
products must be sold.</p>

<p>When gold leaves this country it is because prices here are rising.
Prices are now lower than they have been since 1847. Must they
continue declining in order that we may be able to retain all our
gold? It is manifestly impossible for the people of this country
to prosper with a constantly lowering range of prices. It is equally
impossible for the present level of prices to be maintained with a
constantly increasing demand for, and as constantly diminishing
a supply of, gold. It is universally admitted that an increase in the
money circulation of this country at the present time is an exigent
necessity. The advocates of the single gold standard, while admitting
that we must increase our money volume, the effect of which
must be to maintain, if it does not raise, the level of prices here,
insist that we shall let none of our gold go in order that prices abroad
may rise.</p>

<p>Mr. BLAIR. May I ask the Senator a question?</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. BLAIR. Does the Senator mean to be understood that the
falling of prices is an absolute demonstration of the increased value
of the money without limitation?</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. I have already, in the early portion of my
remarks, had occasion to state that when a fall in prices was brought
about by a larger subordination of the forces of nature to the uses of
man, as where the comforts and conveniences of life could be produced
with less sacrifice than before, it was not an injury to society,
but in advantage. In other words, if, by a certain amount of sacrifice
seventeen year ago, only one pair of shoes could be produced,
and if by the same sacrifice two pairs could be now produced, there
would be a lowering of the price of shoes to about one-half of what
it was seventeen years ago, which would be a very great benefaction
to mankind.</p>

<p>But, as I then stated, there is one certain sign that that is not, except
to the slightest extent, the cause of the present universal fall
of prices. When prices fall owing to improvements in manufacture,
business revives, the masses of the people are at work, those who
toil find themselves possessed of more of the comforts, of the conveniences,
and even of the luxuries of life than before. They are
better contented with their condition, and more buoyant and hopeful
than before. On such occasions money becomes more and more
in demand than it was before, and instead of being hoarded is put
into active and productive business where it will make a profit. But
when interest falls, pari passu, with the fall of prices, it shows that
the fall of prices is not due, except in the smallest degree, to improved
methods of production, but to the increased value of money.</p>

<p>Mr. BLAIR. I was not controverting the Senator's theory as to
the existing facts in this country, but I understood him to be laying
down an absolute principle, applicable under all circumstances and
in all times, that the fall of prices is a demonstration of the increased
value of money. I supposed that the fall in prices resulting from a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p089" id="Page_p089">[89]</a></span>
protective tariff was beneficial, and not an indication of an increase
in the value of money, and that that fall of price was not owing to
the increased value of money, but was by improved machinery and
all that. So it is possible that some of the fall in prices in this
country may be owing to increased facility in the matter of production
and to the beneficial operations of the protective tariff.</p>

<p>Mr. JONES of Nevada. Mr. President&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. REAGAN. If the Senator from Nevada will permit me, I wish
to ask the Senator from New Hampshire if he means to be understood
as assuming that a protective tariff reduces the value of the
commodities produced?</p>

<p>Mr. BLAIR. I was simply asking for information of the Senator
from Nevada, and he can answer that question much better than I;
but the Senator from Texas understands very well that I do believe
a protective tariff reduces prices.</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. Mr. President, so far as a tariff has the
effect of reducing prices in any country, it is not by reason of the
levying of any certain percentage of duty on the imported goods.
The first effect of the tariff certainly always must be to raise prices.
The fundamental theory of the tariff is&mdash;whether it be correct or not
I am not now discussing&mdash;that by that tariff you place the price of
manufactured goods up to a range at which they can be produced in
the country in which the tariff is levied, and upon the level of the
range of wages and manner of living which obtain in that country.
By so doing, if you have a proper volume of money, you set all
your people at work, and keep them at work at a variety of occupations.
In such case every forge, furnace, and factory becomes a
school, every machine-shop an academy, and every cunning device
and invention becomes a lesson, teaching the people how to deal with
the subtle forces of the universe. So far as this country is concerned
the theory of the tariff is that 65,000,000 people should have a varied
and complete system of manufactures, which should supply practically
all their own wants, instead of an abnormal proportion of them
being driven into the single occupation of farming and relying on
foreign manufacturers to supply such finished products as they need.
To draw out and develop the aptitudes of a people a large variety
of occupations is indispensable. When all men are employed at their
aptitudes new inventions multiply, progress is accelerated, and the
secrets of nature are more rapidly unfolded. Hence the McCormick
reaper; hence the sewing-machine, that great instrument which
clothes the world, because of the discovery that the eye of the needle
should be at the point; hence the air-brake, the telegraph, the electric
light, and thousands of other inventions that a protected people
originate and develop, which would perhaps not have been originated
or might have been long delayed if it had not been for the discouragement
to imports caused by the tariff, and the encouragement
to our people to go into manufactures by which their varied talents
are drawn out and cultivated.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that eventually as our conditions improve, increasing
numbers of our people will by degrees emerge from agricultural
and enter manufacturing pursuits. A tariff, by stimulating the
organization and development of industries, trains men to greater skill
and perfection of workmanship in a variety of departments, and with
greater skill comes greater efficiency of labor, and so greater economy
of time. In that way the prices of certain products are in time reduced;
but that is not a reduction of which any one complains.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p090" id="Page_p090">[90]</a></span></p>
<p>The true cause of the present discontent will not be found in the
protective tariff, but in the exactions of the single gold standard.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago England was on the gold standard. It is on
the gold standard to-day; yet prices in England are 35 per cent.
lower than they were fifteen years ago. There being no reason why
there should be any change in the trend of prices, so long as a fierce
contest for the possession of gold shall be waged between England,
France, Germany, and the United States, we are justified in assuming
that a proportionate decline of prices will continue. That means
a further decline of 30 or 35 per cent. in prices during the next fifteen
years. Where is this tendency to stop? and if it does not stop, how
long will it be before the masses of the people become the bond slaves
of the creditors? It is shocking to the moral sense of mankind that a
few money-lenders and bondholders should thus be able, silently and
insidiously, to wreck the business of every country in the world by
constantly increasing the value of the money unit.</p>

<p>While admitting the necessity of more monetary circulation, our
gold standard friends fail to show us how it is possible for an increase
in the volume of money to benefit our merchants, farmers, or mechanics
if the prices that prevail in gold standard countries are to prevail
here; for that is what the gold standard means for us, Mr. President.
It means that the prices that rule in gold standard countries are to
rule here.</p>

<p>The extreme indefiniteness with which the term "gold standard"
is used has so befogged the relation which gold money bears to industry
and commerce that people lose sight of the essential feature
of that relation. It is impossible to have a clear conception of the
gold standard without keeping in view exactly what is implied by
the term. What men must mean in this country by "the gold
standard" is not the touch of the metal, for they never touch it,
and rarely, if ever, see it. The maintenance of the gold standard
here simply means the maintenance here of the range of prices that
prevail in gold-using countries; that is to say, that low and lowering
range of prices rendered necessary by the attempt to measure the
value of the constantly increasing mass of the products of industry
in all the western world by the constantly diminishing volume of
gold. No relief can come to the toiling masses of this country until
we can lift our prices above those that now prevail in gold-using
countries.</p>

<p>Even if our prices remain as they are and do not increase, gold
will eventually leave the country if it continue to increase in value
as it has been increasing during the past fifteen years. We have
been enabled to maintain the gold standard here for the past twelve
years notwithstanding a considerable addition of money other than
gold to our currency, but we have been able to do so only because
other countries have been using an equal or greater amount of money
other than gold. We have been using no greater proportion of silver
or paper money than other countries having the gold standard are
using, hence we have been able to maintain their level of prices and
still keep the metals together. But whenever we shall attempt to
prevent a further fall or prices in this country, it will be impossible
for us to retain our gold so long as prices in gold-using countries continue
to decline as they have been declining. Gold will leave as
quickly because of contraction abroad as of inflation here, if by "inflation"
is meant a coinage of money sufficient to maintain prices at
a steady level.</p>

<p>Should gold leave the country, then, in order to supply its place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p091" id="Page_p091">[91]</a></span>
in order to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in prices, and prevent a further
fall from the present low range, we should need to have as many
dollars of silver in circulation as there are now dollars of gold. Gold
would go out only because our prices were rising, and as it went
prices would cease to rise. That process might continue until three
or four hundred million dollars of gold had gone. In all this, where
would be the disadvantage to our people?</p>

<p>Considering the rapidly increasing population and wealth of this
country, all the silver that can be procured from the mines will be
necessary to maintain the level of prices and to keep pace with the
increasing demands for money. If, however, it slightly exceeds&mdash;and
it could not at the utmost more than slightly exceed&mdash;the amount
actually demanded by increasing population and business, the over-plus
of each year would take a great many years to drive gold out
of the country, dollar for dollar. For, when prices here, of things
internationally dealt in, are at an equilibrium with prices of the
same articles abroad, gold can not go any faster than silver comes in.</p>


<p class="caption">IF $2,500,000 SILVER PER MONTH HAS NOT DRIVEN OUT GOLD, HOW MUCH WILL DO SO?</p>

<p>For twelve years past we have had a silver coinage of nearly
$2,500,000 a month, yet no gold has been driven out. Having tested
the capacity of that quantity of silver to drive out gold, we find that
instead of driving it out its coinage has resulted rather in bringing
gold in. For, to whatever cause the influx of gold may be ascribed,
it is unquestionable that the gold has come, and it has needed all that
gold, and all the silver that we have coined, to maintain international
prices here.</p>

<p>It is admitted by all that gold can not go out except by reason of
a rise in this country of the prices of articles of international commerce
beyond the prices of the same articles prevailing abroad. It
is only then that it becomes more profitable to send out gold in payment
for our foreign purchases than to send out commodities&mdash;the
products of our own country. Commodities will always be sent out
in payment for other commodities so long as it is more profitable to
send them than gold, and when, by reason of low prices prevailing
abroad and high prices here, it is no longer profitable to send out
commodities, purchasers send out gold, but only because it is to their
advantage to do so.</p>

<p>Now, having seen that the coinage of $2,500,000 of silver each
month was insufficient to so raise prices in this country as to induce
gold to go abroad, but that on the contrary it resulted in an influx
and accumulation of a large amount of gold, we may safely assume
that only so much of the amount of silver which Congress shall now
provide for as exceeds $2,500,000 a month will have any influence
in raising prices in this country above international prices, and so
providing a stimulus for gold to go abroad in payment for commodities
imported into this country.</p>

<p>If the amount of silver which shall be now provided should be,
say, $5,000,000 a month, the excess over the present coinage would
be $2,500,000 a month. This, then, would be the amount that would
drive out gold. As one dollar of silver would drive out no more than
one dollar in gold, no more than $2,500,000 could go out monthly.
That would leave in circulation the same amount of money that is
in circulation now. There would still be no increase in the money
volume of the country, and, with no increase in the volume of
money, prices here would not rise above international prices. At
the rate of $2,500,000 a month, it would take twenty years to drive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p092" id="Page_p092">[92]</a></span>
out $600,000,000 of the $700,000,000 of gold now in this country. It
would take even longer than that, because the $600,000,000 driven
out would tend to raise international prices abroad, and so check
the outflow of gold from here.</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. Will the Senator yield to me for a question,
or does he prefer to go on?</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. I am always ready to answer a question.</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. I do not want to interfere with the Senator's
line of argument, or with his speech in any form, but it does seem
to me that there is something fallacious about the Senator's argument,
or else my judgment and the experience of the world is all
wrong. I wanted to ask the Senator this question: If it be known
that the Government of the United States, if you please, by such an
increase of the silver coinage in this country as will be produced by
the free coinage of silver, to which theory, as I understand, the Senator
is fully committed&mdash;if that be the theory of the Government
hereafter by the command of Congress, I want to ask the Senator if
he broadly and boldly asserts that no gold can be driven out of the
country to a greater extent than dollar for dollar for the silver that
comes in?</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. Absolutely; I say so.</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. Then I want to ask the Senator another question,
which seems to be pertinent. Does the Senator assert that if a
72-cent dollar, the value in bullion of a silver dollar during the year
1889, as has been furnished us by the Director of the Mint and the
Secretary of the Treasury, were coined without limit (I say without
limit, the limit being, of course, the amount of bullion that is brought
to the Treasury to coined), and the people of this country who
have been in favor of a safe and honest currency, a currency either
gold or as good as gold, which the Treasury has been able to maintain,
having forced no silver upon the people if they did not wish it,
and in that way the silver dollar having been maintained equal to
the gold dollar, I want to know, with the people of this country
to-day the holders of $500,000,000 of gold, how it is possible for the
Senator to believe that with a 72-cent dollar to take its place the
gold coin would circulate for a single week, or a single day, or a
single hour? If they have the gold will they not hold it?</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. The Senator has so involved his question
with his argument that I can scarcely get at what he wants me to
answer.</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. The question I want the Senator to answer
is this: Will the people of this country, the financiers of this country,
the banks, the moneyed men holding $500,000,000 of gold, with a
certainty of the free coinage of silver and going to a silver basis, for
that is what it means, put their gold in circulation, or will they
hoard it? Will it disappear?</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. I scarcely know what the Senator means
by a "silver basis." He talks about a 72-cent dollar. We have
never seen a 72-cent dollar. The papers in the East have told
us that the silver dollar was worth 72 cents. I recollect talking
on that subject once with some Senators in the cloak-room. During
the conversation one of the Senate pages brought me a telegram, on
which he said the telegraph messenger had told him there were 50
cents due. I give the page a silver dollar and said to him: "I have
been informed by some very respectable and intellectual gentlemen
in here, some of them now candidates for the Presidency even, that this dollar
is worth only 75 cents. I do not want to cheat a little boy. Take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p093" id="Page_p093">[93]</a></span>
this out, and if the boy thinks it worth only 75 cents he can send me
back 25 cents, and if he thinks it is worth a dollar he can send me back
50 cents. I will leave it to him." The page brought back 50 cents
and said the telegraph boy told him he did not know what those old
"duffers" in there might say, but it was as good a dollar as he
wanted and was very hard to get. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>The Senator talks about the bullion value as though that had anything
whatever to do with the value of the dollar. I have attempted
to demonstrate that the material that was in the dollar has nothing
whatever to do with it. Let me illustrate. Suppose the entire supply
of silver of the world to-day were $60,000,000. Suppose the
law limited the coinage of it to $58,000,000, and every dollar coined
was at par with gold. Suppose there were a demand for half a
million dollars of silver, to be used in the arts, and that the remainder
($1,500,000) of uncoined silver were barred from the imperial
money use. That supposes a supply of $2,000,000 left after satisfying
the requirements for coinage, and supposes only half a million
dollars' demand for use in all the arts. In that case there
would be a $2,000,000 supply bearing down a half million dollars'
art demand, or a proportion between supply and demand of 4
to 1. Suppose that under those circumstances silver bullion went
to 50 cents an ounce. Would the Senator then say that 50 cents an
ounce was the value of the $58,000,000, and all the rest of the coined
silver of the western world, while by coining another million and a
half, which would be nothing to a country like this, all the silver
would be at par with gold? Every ounce of silver coined in Europe
and the United States is at par with gold, a thousand or twelve
hundred million dollars of it to-day in France, $200,000,000 in Germany,
$370,000,000 of it here. We are not dealing with the price of
silver bullion, that portion of silver that is deprived of its immemorial
use as money. We do not say what the commodity demand
for silver may make that worth. Such a consideration has no bearing
whatever on the value of money.</p>

<p>I will suppose that in some one county of the United States a law
were passed that the wheat grown in that particular county should
have no right to go through the grist-mill, and that that wheat, as
it might very naturally do, being deprived of use, fell to one-half the
price of the wheat grown elsewhere in the country. Would the
price of the wheat of that one county thus under interdiction and
denied the grist be a fair gauge by which to measure the value of
the entire wheat crop of the country? Manifestly not. All we have
to do is to take up the little "slack" of silver, and all of it will at
once be at par with gold; then we shall hear no more about the "commodity
value" of silver. That is the contention that the bimetallists
make.</p>

<p>Mr. HEARST. It will be $1.29.</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. It will be $1.29 an ounce in one week&mdash;in
three days&mdash;in fact the very moment you give it back its ancient
right of coinage and restore to it its full money power. You coin of
gold all that is brought to the mint, and you deny to a certain
portion of silver that same long-established privilege, and then you
measure the value of the whole supply of silver by that of the little
fraction that is not coined, and which therefore has to find a market
as a commodity.</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. Then, if the Senator will permit me, he necessarily
proposes that the Government of the United States shall take
up all this "slack," as he calls it, in the surplus quantity of silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p094" id="Page_p094">[94]</a></span>
and shall use it in the coinage. The mints of Europe being closed
against the coinage of silver, there is no other place where it will be
coined. Now, if the Government of the United States should use all
the surplus silver in the country, which has simply forced the price
down since we remonetized silver in 1878 more than 20 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. Gold has risen 35 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. Then I think the Senator's argument is upon
this idea and upon this plan, that after we are upon a silver basis,
as we should be most assuredly, there would be no inequality in the
money, because it would be all silver.</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. And no inequality between it and gold.</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. Certainly not, because there would be no gold
in circulation. But let me ask the Senator another question. While
he can use his short-legged silver dollar for the payment of debts,
when he comes to make a new obligation would not the price of the
goods assume a price equal to the difference between gold and silver?
In other words, while you can use a debased currency for the payment
of debts, if a legislative decree requires that you shall accept
it, you can not use it for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. I can not understand the Senator. We
have not provided any "short-legged" dollar. The Senator is assuming
a good many facts and attempting to adjust me to them. I
ask the Senator to wait until he has heard my argument, and I
invite the Senator then to make reply to it.</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. I am sorry that I interfered with the Senator.</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. It was no interference on the part of the
Senator, except that I can not separate the Senator's questions from
the argument and assumptions that he makes. As to the outflow of
gold, as I have said, it would take a long time for even $400,000,000
of it go. The amount of gold driven out would tend to raise prices
abroad by making money more plentiful there, and so check the outflow
of gold from here. When Senators speak about $600,000,000 of
gold being withdrawn from circulation here a question that is a little
curious arises. What are these people who own it going to do with
that gold after they have withdrawn it from circulation? Are they
going to invest it in Great Britain? Are they going to invest it in
France? Are they going to the Cape of Good Hope to invest it? If
they are they will reverse the policy that English capitalists are pursuing
now and have been pursuing for years&mdash;bringing their gold
over here for investment. The Senator tells us that gold is to disappear
from circulation. What will the owners do with it? Where
and in what are they going to invest it?</p>

<p>Mr. McPHERSON. It will be held for a premium.</p>

<p>Mr. JONES, of Nevada. But who will buy it at a premium? Who
needs it at all? For what purpose is it needed? Who is going to
pay any premium for it? Nobody is "short" on it, and there is no
law which forces anybody to have it.</p>

<p>Mr. President, nobody wants it enough to give a premium for it.
It is only worth what is daily paid in the markets of the world and
nobody is going to pay a premium for it. It is a bogie with which
to frighten the people who demand reform in the currency of this
country. Let them withdraw their gold.</p>

<p>I tell the Senator it is not the men who hoard the gold in vaults
who maintain or promote the prosperity of this country, but the
toilers in the wheat-fields and on the farms of the country, the men
who work in the planing mills, the forges, the furnaces, the factories,
and in all our institutions of industry. It is they that bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p095" id="Page_p095">[95]</a></span>
us our prosperity, and not these people who are gambling for premiums
on gold.</p>

<p>Let them gamble among themselves; let who lose and let who win,
the people care nothing. The people of the United States are going
to institute a money that shall install and maintain justice as between
the citizens of this country, and they will not be impeded. I can tell
the Senator that neither his party nor the Republican party will ever
impede the march that this great country is about to make&mdash;the first
in the world, I am glad to say&mdash;in adjusting to the demands of industry
and commerce, that great instrument, money, the non-adjustment
of which, as I have already stated, has, in my belief,
caused more misery than was ever caused by war, pestilence, and
famine.</p>

<p>But to resume at the point where I was interrupted:</p>

<p>The gold going out would tend constantly to restore the equilibrium
between our prices and those of the gold-using countries,
making the proportion of the gold outflow each year less than that
of the year before. If there be included in this computation the
remaining $100,000,000 of gold, which would remain after the outflow
of the $600,000,000, we shall be compelled to come to the conclusion
that the time when our stock of gold can be driven out will
be almost indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p>But even should all our gold go by reason of the remonetization
of silver, it will not be to the injury of the gold standard, but to
its great advantage, and to the equally great advantage of the
masses of the people, as well of this country, which the gold may
leave, as of all countries to which it may go. It will make the
"gold standard" consistent with the prosperity of the countries
maintaining it. But instead of preserving the gold standard of to-day,
which is a standard of wrong, it will inaugurate a gold standard
that will approximate to a standard of justice.</p>

<p>The new "gold standard" that would be established by the outflow
of our gold would be a standard of prices resulting from the
influx into England, France, and Germany, the principal gold-using
countries of Europe, of more than $600,000,000 of money.</p>

<p>So considerable an addition to their money-stock would raise
prices in those countries, and by remaining there, would, with the
current production, which we could spare to them, tend to maintain
prices at a steady level. Such a condition would be an inestimable
boon to the overburdened masses of Europe, and their prosperity
would not be attained at the expense of the people of the United
States. We could well afford to let gold go, since, by the coinage
of silver, our own money volume would not be reduced. The rise
of prices which it would effect in Europe would not only, as I
have stated, secure better prices for our exported goods, but would
undoubtedly enable us to maintain prices here at a substantial parity
with those of Europe&mdash;that is to say, with those of the new, more
rational and more beneficent gold standard which would be established
by the full remonetization of silver in this country.</p>


<p class="caption">PRACTICALLY NO GOLD MONEY IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>But, aside altogether from this consideration, the gold that we
already have is really a surplus&mdash;it is practically a dead and useless
article. Gold, Mr. President, can not with entire truth be said at
the present time to form any part of the money of this country.
Who but a bank clerk ever sees a gold piece? With the exception
of a few million dollars on the Pacific coast, gold is not really in cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p096" id="Page_p096">[96]</a></span>culation
in this country. It is performing no useful function whatsoever.
While I am engaged in delivering these remarks I venture
to say no Senator within the sound of my voice has in his pocket a
single gold coin of any denomination whatever, or any paper representative
of one.</p>

<p>This is the answer to the fear expressed by some Senators that
when those who hold gold shall observe the enlargement of the money
circulation by the issue of the proposed Treasury notes they will
be likely to hoard it. They are already hoarding it. Every body
knows that that is about all that gold is used for in this country.
It is hardly possible for it to be hoarded to any greater extent than
it is at the present time. So little is this metal in circulation that
I do not deem it any exaggeration to say that there are millions of
people in the United States, "native here, and to the manner born,"
who have never in all their lives seen a gold coin.</p>

<p>How absurd, then, is the claim that any loss is to be suffered by
the alleged future hoarding of gold, or that any calamity can occur
to 65,000,000 people by the disappearance of that which has long
since disappeared.</p>


<p class="caption">THE ARGUMENT BASED ON OUR BALANCE OF TRADE.</p>

<p>One of the staple arguments of the advocates of the single gold
standard is, that if our stock of gold were greatly reduced we should
be unable to make payments to foreign countries in case the balance
of trade turned against us. It is only through an excess of imports
over exports that gold could go, and this country now produces of
nearly all articles almost all that it consumes. With the exception
of two years there has not been a balance of trade against us for
fourteen years, as the following table will show:</p>

<p>By this table it is seen that the only gold-using countries having
a balance of trade against us are Canada, $868,317; France,
$23,446,577; Greece, $823,824; Germany, $13,739,952; Italy,
$5,387,301; Sweden and Norway, $367,850; Turkey, $4,687,731&mdash;making
a total balance against us in gold-using countries,
$49,321,452&mdash;against which we have a balance in our favor with
Great Britain alone of over $200,000,000.</p>

<p>The balance against us in favor of all the silver using countries
could of course be readily settled in silver; and by carefully noting
the figures of the table last given it will be seen that it is in the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p098" id="Page_p098">[98]</a></span>
degree improbable that there will ever be a balance of trade against
us in the gold using countries, taken as a whole.</p>

<p>Hence it is clear that if we had no gold at all we could readily
settle all foreign balances that might be against us.</p>

<p>Nations, however, ultimately, and on the whole, square their accounts
with commodities. Every nation must buy what it wants
with its own products. In this country especially have we nothing
to fear, because any temporary balance against us could always be
met by the yield from our own mines. No country has any difficulty
by reason of my difference in money systems in buying what any
other nation has to sell.</p>

<p>This view is supported by all writers on political economy. I need
quote but one. Professor Cairnes, professor of political economy in
the University College of London, in his able work on "Some unsettled
questions in political economy" (1874), says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It appears to me that the influence attributed by many able writers in the United
States to the depreciation of the paper currency as regards its effects on the foreign
trade of the country is, in a great degree, purely imaginary. An advance in
the scale of prices, <i>measured in gold</i>, in a country, if not shared by other countries,
will at once affect its foreign trade, giving an impulse to importations and checking
the exportation of all commodities other than gold. A similar effect is very
generally attributed by American writers to the action on prices of the greenback
inconvertible currency.</p>

<p>But it may easily be shown that this is a complete illusion. Foreigners do not
send their products to the United States to take back greenbacks in exchange.
The return which they look for is either gold or the commodities of the country; and
if these have risen in price in proportion as the paper money has been depreciated,
how should the advance in paper prices constitute an inducement for them to send
their goods thither? The nominal gain in greenbacks on the importation is exactly
balanced by the nominal loss when those greenbacks came to be converted
into gold or commodities. The gain may, in particular cases, exceed the loss, but,
if it does, the loss will also, in other cases, exceed the gain. On the whole, and on
an average, they can not but be the equivalents of each other.</p></div>

<p>Mr. President, the best place in the world where we can have gold
is not in the Treasury of the United States, not in any sub-treasury,
but in circulation, if not in our own country, then, in the foreign
countries where our surplus products are sold. That is where gold
would do us the most good by making money plentiful and prices
correspondingly high. It does us no good here whatever, locked up
as it always is, and doing none of the work of money, but simply reduces
to the minimum the tax-paying and debt-paying power of our
wheat- and cotton-growing communities.</p>

<p>An unjust money should not be tolerated, whatever the material of
which it may be composed, and the people of this country will not
tolerate it. They do not fear the outflow of gold. If, in order to retain
it, they must continue to lose as they have been losing for the
past fifteen years, they will favor its going, and raise a shout of joy
when it does go. With a perfect money system in our own country
the range of our domestic prices would continue stable and equitable
without regard to the prices of foreign countries. Our foreign trade
would take care of itself, and whatever the balances might be, they
would be much oftener in our favor than against us, and in reality
concern only the importing merchant and not the Government or
the people of the United States. The difficulty of gold-using countries
to get our money, in which to pay us the balances they would
owe us, would be much greater than our difficulty in getting their
money, in which to pay them the occasional balances we might owe
them.</p>

<p>Much the more serious question, (if it be a serious question at
all, which I deny) is how they shall get our money, not how we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p099" id="Page_p099">[99]</a></span>
shall get theirs. As the balances would be for the most part in our
favor, it is for them to take such steps as may be necessary in order
to pay us. But there is no just reason to apprehend difficulty in
either case. A great country like the United States will have no
trouble in buying the money of any other country at equitable
rates&mdash;at rates regulated by the purchasing powers of the moneys of
the two countries, respectively.</p>

<p>No country in the history of the world, having a money local to
itself, has ever found the slightest difficulty in buying, upon ratios
determined by the relative purchasing powers of the two kinds of
money, a sufficient amount of foreign exchange (which simply means
the money of another country) to meet all adverse balances of trade.</p>

<p>While earnestly advocating the full remonetization of silver and
the maintenance in this country of a money volume sufficient to insure
a steady level of prices and an unchanging value in the money
unit, I entirely disclaim any desire for an inflation of the currency.
My contention is that without silver we can not keep prices from
further decline, and can not have enough money to serve the growing
needs of population, industry, and commerce.</p>

<p>At the same time I can not refrain from expressing the conviction
that, as between inflation and contraction, no careful student of history
and of economic science can for a moment hesitate in deciding
that the evils inflicted on society by contraction have been longer
in duration and infinitely greater in degree than any that have ever
resulted from inflation. During all periods in which there has been a
generous increase in the money-volume of a country or of the world,
activity and prosperity have been its accompaniment. I challenge
the citation of an instance to the contrary.</p>

<p>With a volume of money increasing at a rate sufficient to meet the
demands of a growing population, and especially if the money be
such as will not leave the country, but, under all circumstances,
will remain in it, to sustain prices, preserve equities, and reward
labor, no country with a proper co&ouml;rdination of its industries can
be otherwise than prosperous.</p>

<p>The property of mobility&mdash;of fluidity&mdash;which is so much lauded in
gold, is precisely the property least to be desired in the money of a
country, if that property of mobility or fluidity is to keep alternately
bringing money into and taking it out of the country, disturbing
prices and disarranging equities. When it comes, if it enters into
circulation, prices rise; when it goes, prices fall, and thus, instead of
having a steady and level platform of prices on which the trade and
industry of the Republic may rest, like the firm and level platform
of liberty upon which all our citizens stand, we whose business it is
to "see that the Republic take no harm," furnish our people with an
"inclined plane" of finance on which all their business must be conducted.
Men buying this month at the elevated end of the platform
find themselves selling next month at the depressed end.</p>

<p>Whenever in the history of a country there has been least reliance
on international money (gold) and more reliance on merely national
money (even of paper when reasonable limits were placed upon its
quantity), prosperity has been everywhere present. I need not recall
to the minds of Senators the wave of prosperity that swept over
this country when it was without any international money and
resorted to the "greenback" currency.</p>

<p>When, as a result of the Franco-German war, France was deprived
of international money, suspended specie payments, and resorted to
a properly limited paper currency, her progress was unbounded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p100" id="Page_p100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>No period in the history of Great Britain can compare for activity,
prosperity, or achievement, with the twenty years preceding 1816,
when specie payments were suspended, and during which period, as
testified to by witnesses before the secret committee of Parliament,
the discount rate of the Bank of England did not buffer a single
change; whereas from that period to 1847 the rate was changed
sixteen times, and from 1847 to 1874 as many as 274 times, the fluctuations
being sometime of the most violent character.</p>

<p>When gold threatens to leave Great Britain the rate of discount
at the Bank of England is raised, with the view of discouraging, if
not preventing, the outflow. Raising the rate of discount is like
putting the brakes on a railroad train; lowering the rate is like
letting off the brakes.</p>

<p>These changes were not due to any greater demand for money
but to the movements of gold. There was frequently, in the condition
of business, no warrant whatever for a rise in the rate of
discount. The only reason for it was to prevent gold from performing
what "our most conservative financiers" denominate its
"noble" function of "mobility"&mdash;of "fluidity"&mdash;namely, the
function of going "where it was wanted." This function of going
"where it is wanted" is described as the great "mission" of
gold, and it is assumed that it will never be wanted at more than
one place at a time. Yet hear what the chancellor of the exchequer
of Great Britain said a few days ago in the House of Commons:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I admit that, as interested in the commerce and monetary system of this country
I feel a kind of shame that on the occasion of &pound;2,000,000 or &pound;3,000,000 of gold being
taken from this country to Brazil, or any other country, it should immediately
have the effect of causing a monetary alarm throughout the country. (Speech of
the chancellor of the exchequer in the House of Commons, April 18, 1890.)</p></div>

<p>This is a suggestive admission, from so well-informed a source, as
to the operation of the single gold standard. I commend it to those
who would circumscribe and hamper the prosperity of this country
by making gold alone the standard of all values.</p>

<p>I have thought it necessary, Mr. President, to state what I conceive
to be the true principles of the science of money, the principles that,
with the progress of time and growth of intelligence, must prevail
the world over; because, without a clear understanding of the relation
which the quantity of money in a country bears to the prosperity
and happiness of its people, there would be no justification for an
addition of either silver, gold, or any other form of money to the
quantity already in circulation. If the value of money depends on
quantity, then, as long as the world adheres to the automatic theory
of money, my contention is that all the silver produced from all the
mines of the world should be transmuted into coin; and even then,
if the wants of the world continue to increase as they have been increasing,
it is only a question of time, and that not far distant, when
the combined supply of both metals will be insufficient to maintain
the equities in time transactions.</p>

<p>The world having decreed to stand by the automatic system we are
now dealing with the question as a practical one.</p>

<p>The only relief that can be had is to adhere strictly to that system,
and give it full scope. Remove all legislative restrictions and let the
world have the full benefit of all the precious metals that are yielded
by the mines.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p101" id="Page_p101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">THE WORLD'S SUPPLY OF GOLD AND SILVER.</p>

<p>Since for thousands of years the world recognized both silver and
gold as money, can anybody tell what has happened to render one
of them unfitted for the money use?</p>

<p>No argument based on fluctuations in the current supplies of either
of the metals can militate against the use of both as money. The
fluctuation in the annual yield of both, taken together, is much less
violent and less frequent than the fluctuation of either taken separately.
By the use of both, society has much greater security against
the evil of an insufficient money volume. While a large yield, now
of one, and again of the other, has taken place, there is no instance
in the history of the world of an extraordinary yield of both occurring
simultaneously, except in the single instance of the first discovery
of the mines of America. When the gold mines have been yielding
largely, there has been no special increase of silver, and during
the period when silver has been produced in comparatively large
quantities the gold mines have been less productive.</p>

<p>This will be illustrated by the following table showing the yield of
both gold and silver, from the discovery of America to the present
time.</p>

<p>From this table it will be seen that from 1801 to 1820 the average
yearly yield of gold was $9,710,500; of silver, $36,847,500&mdash;four of
silver to one of gold.</p>

<p>From 1821 to 1840 the average yearly yield of gold was $11,466,000;
of silver, $21,964,000&mdash;two of silver to one of gold.</p>

<p>From 1841 to 1860 the average yearly yield of gold was $85,150,000;
of silver, $34,826,500&mdash;two and a half of gold to one of silver.</p>

<p>From 1861 to 1880 the yearly average yield of gold was $117,991,850;
of silver, $68,043,900&mdash;nearly two of gold for one of silver.</p>

<p>From 1881 to 1889 the yearly average yield of gold was $105,500,000:
of silver, $122,540,388&mdash;one-sixth more silver than gold.</p>

<p>From those figures it is plain that no continuous, extraordinary
yield of silver, such as might warrant the slightest fear of an unnecessary
addition to the money volume, is to be expected. On the other
hand the continuous drain of gold for use in the arts, as dentistry,
gold plate, jewelry, gilding, and articles of decoration generally, is
seriously encroaching upon the annual supply.</p>

<p>Both metals possess in common, and neither in any different degree
from the other, all the qualities which are recognized as necessary in
a commodity money. Silver enjoys in an equal degree with gold the
quality of indestructibility, of divisibility, of malleability, and of
resistance to chemical changes. The stock of both existing in the
world (the product of all time) is estimated to be about equal, the
production of the past 500 years being set down as&mdash;</p>

<p>That silver mining has not proved exceptionally profitable in this
country is proved by the comparatively small number that have engaged
in the business. This country has been thoroughly explored in
the search for additional mines without any of great value being discovered.
The allurements of the business lie in its uncertainty; and
for the occasional prize that is drawn thousands of blanks are found.
There is always enough hope of results to induce continued effort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p103" id="Page_p103">[103]</a></span>
but there is also sufficient doubt and discouragement to deter an undue
number from engaging in the business.</p>

<p>The mines of Mexico have been worked for hundreds of years; and
up to 1873 the business of silver mining in that country had all the
stimulus that a parity at 15&frac12; to 1 could give to it. It is not, therefore,
probable that any material increase of output can be expected
from that quarter.</p>

<p>Conceding, for the sake of the argument, the eventual possibility of
so superabundant a yield of silver as to work injury and inequity to
the interests of creditors, is it not manifest that it is in the power of
society at all times to remedy the evil by a limitation of the coinage?
And on the other hand, is it not equally manifest that for an
insufficient supply there is no remedy?</p>

<p>If great mountains of silver should be discovered, does not Congress
meet constantly? If there should seem to be too much, could
not the coinage be readily limited to prevent depreciation? But,
on the other hand, when we dedicate the monetary function solely
to one metal, of which there is manifestly and admittedly the world
over an insufficient supply, where is the remedy? What can Congress
do to enlarge that supply? Absolutely nothing.</p>


<p class="caption">THE GOLD USED IN THE ARTS.</p>

<p>The Director of the United States Mint a few years ago estimated
that of the $100,000,000 gold annually produced from the mines of
the world $46,000,000 are consumed in the manufacture of jewelry,
gold plate, plated ware, gold-leaf, etc., and in various processes of
dentistry.</p>

<p>The single standard of gold, therefore, is maintained by the creditor
nations in the face of the admitted fact that but $50,000,000 of
that metal are annually added to the money stocks.</p>

<p>Not only is this encroachment of the commodity demand on the
money supply becoming greater year by year, with the growth of
population, but the supply of gold from the mines is itself becoming
less, having declined from an average of $137,000,000 between
1856 and 1860 (the period of greatest yield from California and
Australia), to an average of $107,000,000 for the past ten years.
Of the entire gold supply of the world, nine-tenths of it have come
from placer mines, readily discoverable and easily worked, because
requiring little or no capital. All known fields of those are practically
exhausted, and there is no reasonable prospect of the discovery
of others. Hardy, adventurous, and skillful miners from the United
States, and capitalists from all countries, have ransacked the world
in vain for new fields of gold. Why, then, with the knowledge of
those facts before us, should we discard from the full money use and
function the only metal that gives to the world any prospect of relief
from the money famine from which civilization is now suffering
and from which, if silver be not speedily restored to its ancient
use and function, the world is destined to suffer much more?</p>

<p>If it be conceivable that the demonetization of either metal were
necessary, why demonetize that which promises the greater and
more steady yield? If for any reason society should decide that one
of the metals should be discarded, should it not rather be that one
which promises the smaller future yield, than that which promises
the larger?</p>

<p>Silver is the money-metal best suited to the mass of the people,
and to the variety and character of transactions that constitute the
interchanges of daily life. The supplies of both metals if united by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p104" id="Page_p104">[104]</a></span>
law, in the full money function, would have a steadiness of value
which can not be attained by either separately.</p>


<p class="caption">TREASURY NOTES SHOULD NOT BE REDEEMED IN BULLION</p>

<p>The proposition to redeem the proposed treasury notes in silver
bullion or in anything but lawful money of the United States will
never meet the approval of the people.</p>

<p>What the people of this country want is money, and what they
should have is money. These notes will represent full value received,
the evidence of which is the bullion in possession of the
Government. When issued, they will enter into circulation. They
will have to do the work of money among the people. They will
go to make up the volume of the currency. On the basis of that
volume each dollar acquires a certain value, and represents a given
amount of sacrifice. On that volume, and on those conditions, bargains
will be made, prices established, debts contracted, values adjusted,
and equities created. If any portion of that money be withdrawn
from circulation (for that is what "redemption" means)
without an equivalent amount of money in some other form being
issued to take its place, the circulation will to that extent be
contracted, every dollar in circulation will increase in value, prices
will fall, property-values established on the basis of the larger circulation
will shrink, and equities will be destroyed.</p>

<p>The redemption of any number of those notes in silver bullion
means the withdrawal of many dollars of money from circulation
and the destruction of so much of the money of the country. Money
is not a thing that can be destroyed with impunity. It should be
kept in use among the people. It is to industry what the blood is
to the human body; it is the life-giving and life-sustaining medium.
The money volume of a country should not be subject to frequent and
violent changes. In a new and growing country, it should be characterized
by that steady accretion that characterizes the increase in the
quantity of blood in the human body as it progresses from infancy to
maturity. It is no more unreasoning, empirical, or unscientific to be
alternately withdrawing blood from, and injecting blood into, a human
body than to be constantly contracting and expanding the money
volume of the country. And as activity of circulation of the blood
is essential to the health of the body, so activity of circulation in
money is indispensable to the well-being of society. The possession
of no mere commodity, whatever its value, will compensate a
country for the destruction of any considerable portion of its money,
upon the entire volume of which vast equities rest.</p>


<p class="caption">MONEY SHOULD BE REDEEMABLE IN ALL THINGS.</p>

<p>Money should be redeemed in all things; not in one thing alone.
The peculiar characteristic of true money, that which distinguishes
it from all other things whatsoever and constitutes it a prime factor
in civilization, is that it is at all times redeemable in any thing that
is on sale. Being an order for property, it should be redeemed in any
form of disposable property which the holder may desire.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A guinea&mdash;</p></div>

<p class="noidt">said Adam Smith&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">may be considered as a bill for a certain quantity of necessaries and conveniences
upon all the tradesmen in the neighborhood.</p></div>

<p>Any form of money, the condition of whose existence depends on
redeemability in one thing alone, can not be money in the full sense,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p105" id="Page_p105">[105]</a></span>
and whenever an urgent demand for real money springs up the other
ceases altogether to be money.</p>

<p>The redemption of money should be reciprocal between the Government
and the people and between and among all individuals in
the community. It should not only be redeemable by the Government
by acceptance for taxes but also redeemable by and among the
people for all property for sale and services for hire. Its quantity
should be so regulated as that its unit (the dollar) should neither
increase nor diminish in value, and it should be kept constantly in
circulation, and not be permitted to lie uselessly in the Treasury.
Any other money than this is to a certain extent counterfeit; it is
false money, because when most needed it fails to be money and has
to be "redeemed" in something else (gold) which can not be got
except at ruinous sacrifice.</p>

<p>It is of the very essence of money&mdash;its pith and marrow and protoplasm&mdash;that
it should be a legal tender, a universal solvent, the ultimate
of payment, and redeemable, at the prices ruling, in everything
that is on sale. If the volume of such money be properly regulated,
while there may from time to time be variations in the prices
of particular articles, the general range of prices will be maintained
practically undisturbed.</p>

<p>What an absurdity it is for the Government to put its stamp on one
thing in order to make it redeemable in another thing imprinted
with the same stamp, but which nobody wants except for the purpose
of getting a third thing that could have been got just as well
without the intervention of the second. As well might he who,
wanting water, is given a silver cup wherewith to get it, but on going
to the spring is forbidden to drink until he exchanges his silver
cup for a gold one.</p>

<p>The real reason why it is insisted that all other things than gold
shall be exchangeable into gold is that gold is getting dearer by reason
of decreasing supply and increasing populations. The necessity
for convertibility into gold implies that, in ordinary times, a range
of prices higher than the gold range will prevail, and when, by reason
perhaps of increased activity of business, redemption comes to
be demanded prices are at once precipitated to those of the gold
standard and below, to the great advantage of the creditor classes,
who, as owners of bonds, may be considered in the language of the
stock exchange "long" on money, and to the equally great injury
of the producing class, who, being in debt, may be considered as having
sold money "short."</p>

<p>The supreme consideration is that the money of a country shall be
so regulated as that prices may not fall from any cause inhering in
the money system. The value of money&mdash;in other words, the sacrifice
necessary to obtain it&mdash;should be no greater at one time than at
another. In order to effect that object of prime consequence, to maintain
the value of money unchanging, there should be no hesitancy
whatever in changing the material of which it is made.</p>

<p>Nobody who has reflected on the subject for a moment doubts that
what gave "value" or exchangeable power to the greenback was
not the promise made on its face, without date, to pay a dollar, but
the inscription on its back which declared it a legal tender for all
dues and demands, public and private, except duties on imports. It
was a misfortune to mankind that the words "promise to pay" were
printed on it, because by it millions were led to believe that the
"value" or exchangeable power resided in the promise instead of in
the legal-tender power conferred upon it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p106" id="Page_p106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no object in redeeming in gold, except to maintain gold
prices, that is to say, the range of prices prevailing in gold-using
countries, and as those prices are constantly trending downward, any
country that insists on maintaining the gold standard must accept the
consequences in a corresponding fall of prices. The advocates of the
gold standard, in effect, maintain that no matter to what extreme
prices may fall, we must be content&mdash;we must bow in humble submission
to the inevitable, since, in their view, it is more necessary to
maintain the sacredness of the gold standard than to establish justice,
promote prosperity, or to maintain equity in all time transactions.</p>

<p>It is in no way necessary, on account of any intrinsic or inherent
quality of gold, that should have that particular metal, and that
alone, for money.</p>

<p>It is boasted that gold is a universal measure. Why is it universal?
Why is gold accepted in every country of the world? Not because
the gold is wanted for any quality inherent in the metal, but
because it is an order for property in gold-using countries, such as England,
France, and Germany, whose trade is largely a foreign trade.
At whatever rate gold will exchange in England, it will exchange in
all countries having trade relations with England, because it is an
order for goods in a country with which they are dealing. Will not
the money of this country equally, and for like reasons, whether gold
or silver, have acceptability in every country with which the United
States have trade relations? Not for any quality inherent in the
metal, but because it is an order for property in the United States.
Will it not be willingly accepted by those who wish to buy in this
country?</p>


<p class="caption">POSSIBLE EFFECT OF REDEMPTION IN BULLION.</p>

<p>In order to see the effect of the redemption of these Treasury notes
in bullion, we have but to look at the possibilities of the situation.
Suppose there were in the Treasury $300,000,000 worth of that bullion,
which, by the taking up, little by little, and month by month,
of the amount not used in the arts, would be taken by the Treasury
at or about par. Then, suppose that for any reason, such as fear of
approaching panic or otherwise, $100,000,000 of the Treasury notes
were suddenly presented for redemption, and canceled, and the bullion
as suddenly put on the market, what would it be worth? What
would gold bullion be worth if it had not the privilege of coinage,
and if $100,000,000 of it, deprived of the money use, was suddenly put
on the market? Can there be a doubt that the abrupt output of so
large a quantity would have the effect of immediately and enormously
depreciating its value? In the case under consideration, the
result would be that the silver remaining in the Treasury would
not bring one-fourth the sum necessary to redeem the outstanding
Treasury notes, so that not only would a heavy loss result to the
Government, but, by reason of the sudden and serious contraction
of the money volume, an infinitely greater loss would result to all the
people.</p>

<p>But if it be deemed a remote contingency that any extraordinary
amount would in that manner be suddenly taken from the Treasury,
there is another danger which can not be put aside as improbable,
but which, on the contrary, is to be looked for with almost absolute
certainty, and to my mind, constitutes an irremovable and insurmountable
objection to any system of bullion redemption.</p>

<p>A large number of merchants in London need, monthly, millions
of dollars worth of silver to make payments in India. They will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p107" id="Page_p107">[107]</a></span>
naturally want to get it at the lowest price, and it is not to their
advantage to intensify the competition for it. On the contrary, it
is to their direct advantage to depress the price to the lowest possible
point.</p>

<p>As the Treasury of the United States would buy silver at the lowest
price, the London merchants would refuse to enter the open market
in competition with our Government for its purchase. But no
sooner could the silver be stored in the vaults of the Treasury, than the
agents of the London merchants would appear, and before any opportunity
had offered for a favorable change in the price of the bullion,
could present as many millions of these notes as might suit their purpose,
and receive bullion therefor. A Secretary of the Treasury who
conscientiously believed that it was his duty to maintain the gold
standard at all hazards, would naturally feel compelled&mdash;certainly
it would be in his power&mdash;to put out whatever amount of bullion he
might deem necessary to accomplish that purpose, even if it all had
to go.</p>

<p>Thus the United States Treasury would become the convenient
and capacious conduit through which silver should immediately
flow from this country to England, depriving our people, notwithstanding
the legislative measures for their relief, of practically all
use of silver as money, inasmuch as the four and a half-million
dollars of Treasury notes would be withdrawn and canceled about
as soon as issued.</p>

<p>Thus would our Treasury Department be made practically the purchasing
agent in this country of any syndicate or combination of
English merchants who might desire silver for the East India trade.</p>

<p>If it be said that no Secretary of the Treasury would attempt thus
to defeat the will of the people as expressed in the law, the sufficient
reply is that a conscientious man who believes that the honor of the
United States is pledged to the maintenance of the gold standard,
and that it is indispensable to the prosperity of the people, will exercise
all the power vested in him by law to prevent a departure
from that standard, and will regard himself as for the time being
the savior of the Republic by keeping it from "the edge of so dangerous
a peril" as the execution of the people's will.</p>

<p>Certainly no man will deny to the present Secretary of the Treasury
entire rectitude of motive in all his conduct. From the well-known
fact that since the passage of the limited coinage act of 1878
all our Secretaries have refrained from purchasing more silver than
they were compelled to do by the mandatory provision of that law,
it is reasonable to infer that none of them, if called upon to execute
a law containing a silver bullion redemption clause, such as is suggested,
would feel called upon to make a net purchase of more than
$2,000,000 worth in each month; and that none of them would hesitate
to exchange for Treasury notes all the monthly purchases of
bullion in excess of that amount.</p>


<p class="caption">A PLANK FROM THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM.</p>

<p>I must be pardoned for directing the attention of Senators on this
side of the Chamber to a short declaration of the last Republican
National Convention:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Republican party is in favor of the use of both gold and silver as money.</p></div>

<p>If party platforms mean anything that clause meant that the Republican
party went before the country pledged to the use and to the
equal and non-discriminating use of both silver and gold as money.
It was well known that throughout the entire West the question<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p108" id="Page_p108">[108]</a></span>
of the remonetization of silver was deemed of vital importance, and
party orators and the party press, throughout that entire section
were severe in their denunciation of the prior administration of
its unfriendly attitude toward silver.</p>

<p>I wish in all solicitude and sincerity to advise my Republican
friends of the East that this plank in the party platform was construed
by the Republicans of the West to mean precisely what it
says. They are looking with confidence to this Congress for such
action as will fittingly embody in the statutes the principle laid down
by the party now in the responsible direction of the Government.</p>


<p class="caption">SHALL WE BE FLOODED WITH SILVER?</p>

<p>We are told that if silver is given free access to the mints we
shall be flooded with it from all parts of the world. Does anybody
show where the flood of silver is to come from? Where are the reservoirs
that contain it? Not in England, where it is difficult for the
people even to get a sufficiency of it for small change to transact the
business of the country: not in Germany, where the scarcity of money
was so pressing that the government had to abandon the idea of selling
silver. Though the stock in France is large her people will never
give it up. Silver has been the "shield and buckler" of the French
Republic. All she has is coined at the ratio of 15&frac12; ounces of silver to
1 of gold, and its shipment to this country would involve a loss to
France, not only of the 3 per cent. difference between the French relation
(15&frac12; to 1) and ours (which is 16 to 1), but of 3 per cent. additional
in the cost of gathering and shipping it. And after that
could only exchange them for Treasury notes. The silver stock in
India and the Orient is performing indispensable duty as money, and
no "flood" of it can be expected from that quarter. From time immemorial
India has been absorbing all the surplus silver of the
world. She has never got so much as to appease her appetite for
more. So insatiable is her desire for that metal that she has long
been known as the "Sink of Silver." China has not a piece of the
metal that she can dispose of. Mexico has no stock whatever of silver
on hand, except the limited number of coined pieces forming her
moderate money circulation, and not a dollar of it can be spared. No
country of Central or South America has any surplus silver. Every
piece of coined silver in every country in the world is part of the monetary
circulation of that country, and even when of short weight and
classified as a mere "token" is passing at par as full valued money.
No gain could possibly accrue, therefore, to the owners of coined silver
anywhere by shipping it to this country for any purpose, and
there is no surplus stock of bullion anywhere.</p>

<p>If anybody doubts this statement let him make the attempt in all
the money centers of the world to buy from accumulated stock even
$5,000,000 worth of it. He will fail to get it in London, Paris, Berlin,
Calcutta, New York, or San Francisco, or in all combined. There is
no source from which to get silver except the current supply from
the mines, and whatever that is now it is not likely ever greatly to
increase. The occupation of mining is not attractive to many, and
in the nature of the case the number who follow it will always be
comparatively few. The Argonauts of old were but a small band of
hardy adventurers; those of the new era are destined to bear no
larger proportion to the population. But even were this not so, nature
herself draws the line. To the eye of the experienced prospector
silver mines are as discernible on the surface of the earth as
are mountains, and the world has been explored in vain for further
"finds." Those who talk, therefore, of "floods" of silver coming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p109" id="Page_p109">[109]</a></span>here for coinage simply show their ignorance of existing conditions.</p>

<p>I may add that of all the shafts that have been sunk for silver
mines in the world where they have found silver croppings on top
in ninety-nine out of every hundred, and I think I am stating it
moderately, the veins have not penetrated the earth, mineralized,
fertilized, to the depth of 50 feet, rarely have they penetrated the earth
to a depth exceeding 1,200 feet, and the most prolific yield of silver
mines has been from a depth not exceeding 800 feet.</p>

<p>The very fact, Mr. President, that, with all the world searching
for gold and silver mines&mdash;a search that has continued throughout
all history&mdash;the amount of the two metals yielded by the mines is
about equal, shows that the historical relation existing between them
is the relation at which they can be profitably produced.</p>

<p>It is apparent that if there were a great advantage in the production
of silver over gold, at the relation of 15&frac12; to 1, that advantage
would be seen in the largely preponderant production of silver;
but instead we find that the result of thousands of years of mining
has given us about equal quantities of both metals.</p>


<p class="caption">CAN THE UNITED STATES ALONE HOLD THE METALS AT A PARITY?</p>

<p>We are told that the United States, unaided, can not, if it would,
restore silver to a parity with gold&mdash;that no one nation acting alone
can achieve so difficult a feat. But it is incapable of denial that
throughout all vicissitudes of production of gold and silver from
1803 to 1873 the law of France&mdash;one nation alone&mdash;accomplished it.</p>

<p>As I have shown in greater detail elsewhere, by reference to the
table of annual production of the metals, it will be observed that
from 1803 to 1820, the production was in the proportion of four dollars
of silver to one of gold; from 1821 to 1840 two of silver to one
of gold, from 1841 to 1850 one dollar of silver, to one of gold, from 1851
to 1860 four dollars of gold to one of silver, from 1861 to 1865 three
of gold to one of silver, from 1866 to 1870 two of gold to one of silver,
in 1871 and 1872 one-and-a-half of gold to one of silver. Notwithstanding
these extreme variations in the relative annual production
the law of France constituted a ligature sufficient to hold the metals
in line at the ratio of 15&frac12; to 1, and this not for France alone but
for the whole world. If that period does not offer sufficient proof of
the power of law, under varying conditions of supply, to tie the
metals together and keep them so, no degree of proof will suffice,
for the vacillations of their relative production have been greater
during this century than at any former period in the history of the
world.</p>


<p class="caption">IS AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT NECESSARY?</p>

<p>If that could be done by a nation with a population of 25,000,000
to 35,000,000, what difficulty could be experienced by a nation of
65,000,000 in accomplishing the same result?  Yet we are told that
international agreement is necessary to restore silver to its ancient
right as a full-money metal. Those who suggest such an agreement
forget that while this nation is a borrower of money, the first and
principal nation to demonetize silver is the greatest money lender
known to history. Is it for a moment to be supposed that the shrewd
English creditor classes will enter into any agreement which will
deprive them of the spoils of so delicate and ingenious a system
of usury; a system not only not banned by law, but, on the contrary,
having the special approval and protection of statutes, and the active
support and approval of all the complaisant moralists, philosophers,
and financiers of the age?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p110" id="Page_p110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>While they are dilligently gathering in the proceeds of this operation
a diversion is kept up for the occupation and amusement of
dilettant financiers and economists, by invoking a discussion of the
ratio that should be maintained between the metals. The ratio is
the pretext on which conference after conference has been called.</p>

<p>The advocates of the single gold standard contend that hostile
legislation had no influence in effecting the separation of the metals,
and that the reversal of that legislation can not and will not restore
them to a parity unless the principal commercial nations of the
western world join in the work of rehabilitation. As illustrating
the force of law on the relation of the metals I will read a suggestive
paragraph from the report of the Royal Commission of England
(1886), Part I, section 192:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Now, undoubtedly, the date which forms the dividing line between an epoch
of approximate fixity in the relative value of gold and silver, and one of marked
instability, is the year when the bimetallic system which had previously been in
force in the Latin Union ceased to be in full operation, and we are irresistibly led
to the conclusion that the operation of that system, established as it was in countries
the population and commerce of which were considerable, exerted a material
influence upon the relative value of the two metals.</p>

<p>So long as that system was in force we think that, notwithstanding the changes
in the production and use of the precious metals, it kept the market price of silver
approximately steady at the ratio fixed by law between them, namely, 15&frac12; to
1. Nor does it appear to us <i>a priori</i> unreasonable to suppose that the existence
in the Latin Union of a bimetallic system with a ratio of 15&frac12; to 1 fixed between
the two metals should have been capable of keeping the market price of silver
steady at approximately that ratio.</p></div>

<p>The paragraph quoted ascribes the effect thus produced to the bimetallic
treaty of the Latin Union, a combination of Italy, Belgium,
Switzerland, and France, entered into in 1865 for the purpose of
maintaining similar conditions of coinage. But it will be observed
that, so far as the ratio was concerned, precisely the same effect had
been produced by France alone during the sixty-two years from the
passage of its law of 1803 to 1865.</p>

<p>Not only did the French law keep the metals together at a time
when the larger annual yield was of silver, but it kept them together
when the larger annual yield was of gold. Had not that law
been in operation during the '50's, when a flood of gold poured from
the mines of California and Australia, gold would have fallen, as in
early times it more than once fell, to the ratio of 1 to 10, at which
but 10 ounces of silver (instead of 15&frac12;) would buy an ounce of gold.
Thus the law of one country alone, a country then of not one-half
the present population of the United States, held the metals together,
so that to whatever extent gold fell in relation to commodities
from 1848 to 1865, by reason of the large output of the mines,
silver fell to the same extent, notwithstanding the enormous decrease
in its production relatively to gold during that period.</p>

<p>What is claimed for law in this connection is not that it directly
controls the relative values of gold and silver any more than of anything
else, but that on the slightest separation of the metals there
instantly arises, under the law of the double standard, a demand for
the cheaper metal, while the demand for the dearer one is suspended.
In this way the double standard accommodates itself to the law of
supply and demand, which is admitted to be the governing factor in
the determination of value. It is not contended that a small or insignificant
country could keep the metals together, but all experience
goes to show that a great nation like the United States would
have no difficulty whatever in doing so.</p>

<p>So thoroughly are the advantages of the gold standard to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p111" id="Page_p111">[111]</a></span>
creditor classes recognized in England that the English Commissioners,
who, for form's sake, have been sent to the several monetary
conferences held on the continent, have never been invested by their
Government with any power whatever. And it is but a few weeks
since the House of Commons overwhelmingly voted down a proposition
made in good faith by Mr. Samuel Smith, looking to the calling
of a new conference, which was supported by petitions to Parliament
signed by 60,000 persons not merely as individuals, but as representing
large organizations of the toilers of England.</p>

<p>The ratio is not the difficulty. Those who wanted silver demonetized
do not want it added to the money volume of the world at any
ratio. Why then shall we wait? Macauley, commenting on the
impregnability of intrenched prerogative, observed that if the
announcement of the discovery of the law of gravitation had militated
against the personal interests of any vested or privileged
class, its general acceptance might have been long postponed.
Shall we, then, postpone relief to the suffering industries of this
country till we can secure from the privileged classes, from the
money-lenders of the world, an agreement to cease their exactions?</p>

<p>No, Mr. President, we need not wait, and we <i>will</i> not wait. All
that is necessary is to <i>act</i>, and so far as the rules of order and of parliamentary
procedure will permit, we propose to act, promptly and
decisively. The world can not expect the initiatory movement for
any change to be taken by those whose interests are served by the
continuance of present conditions. Such conditions being consistent
with their own welfare, they find no difficulty in arriving at the
conclusion that they are for the welfare of society at large.</p>

<p>The dogma that cupidity is a synonym for virtue will never fail to
find ready converts among the beneficiaries.</p>

<p class="caption">CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>I predict that the restoration of silver to its birthright, Mr. President,
will mark an epoch in the history of this country. It will
place in circulation an amount of money commensurate with our
increasing population. It will give assurance to our languishing
industries that the volume of our circulating medium is not to continue
shrinking, and that the tendency of prices shall no longer be
downward. It will increase the wages of labor and the prices of
the products of labor; it will reduce the price of bonds and other
forms of money futures, it will lighten, but not inequitably, the
burden of mortgages; it will increase largely, though not unjustly,
the debt-paying and tax-paying power of the people. It will loosen
the grasp of the creditor from the throat of the debtor.</p>

<p>By the remonetization of silver, money will cease to be the object
of commerce, and will again become its beneficent instrument. Activity
will replace stagnation, movement will supplant inertia, courage
will banish fear; confidence will dispel doubt; hope will supersede
despair.</p>

<p>The lifting up of silver to its rightful plane by the side of gold
will set in motion all the latent energies of the people. It will banish
involuntary idleness, by putting every willing man to work. It will
revive business, and reanimate the heart and hope of the masses.
Capital, no longer fearing a fall in prices, will turn into productive
avenues. The hoards of money lying idle in the bank vaults will
come out to bless and enrich alike their owners and the community<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_p112" id="Page_p112">[112]</a></span>
at large; while the millions of dollars now invested at low interest
in gilt-edged securities will seek more profitable investment in the
busy field of industry, where they will be utilized in the payment
of wages and the consequent dissemination of comfort and happiness
among the people.</p>

<p>And this it will accomplish not for the United States alone, but
for civilization. For it is not too much to say, Mr. President, that
upon the decision of this question depend consequences more momentous
than upon that of any other question of public policy within
the memory of this generation. In a broader sense than any other
question attracting the general attention of mankind it is a question
of civilization. It embodies the hopes and aspirations of our
race.</p>

<p>The act of Congress which shall happily solve it will constitute
a decree of emancipation as veritable as any that ever freed serf
from thraldom, but more universal in its application. It will proclaim
the freedom of the white race the world over, it will lift the
bowed head of labor, it will hush the threnody of toil. It will inaugurate
the true renaissance&mdash;a renaissance of <i>prosperity</i>, without
which industry, learning, science, literature, art, are but as apples
of Sodom. (Applause in the galleries.)</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
