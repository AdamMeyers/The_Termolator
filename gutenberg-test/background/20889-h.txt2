THIS little book scarcely needs a
preface, as it speaks sufficiently for itself. It is for the most part
the result of studies on the spot of everything of interest connected
with the various sparkling wines which it professes to describe. Neither
pains nor expense have been spared to render it both accurate and
complete, and the large number of authentic engravings with which it is
illustrated will conduce, it is hoped, to its value.

AND

OTHER SPARKLING WINES.




I.       The Origin of Champagne.


The Early Vineyards of the Champagne       Their Produce esteemed by
Popes and Kings, Courtiers and Prelates       Controversy regarding the
rival Merits of the Wines of Burgundy and the Champagne       Dom
Perignon’s happy Discovery of Sparkling Wine       Its Patrons under
Louis Quatorze and the Regency       The Ancient Church and Abbey of
Hautvillers       Farre and Co.’s Champagne Cellars       The Abbey of
St. Peter now a Farm       Existing Remains of the Monastic
Buildings       The Tombs and Decorations of the Ancient
Church       The Last Resting-Place of Dom Perignon       The Legend of
the Holy Dove       Good Champagne the Result of Labour, Skill, Minute
Precaution, and Careful Observation.


Strong men, we know, lived before
Agamemnon; and strong wine was made in the fair province of Champagne
long before the days of the sagacious Dom Perignon, to whom we are
indebted for the sparkling vintage known under the now familiar name.
The chalky slopes that border the Marne were early recognised as
offering special advantages for the culture of the vine. The priests and
monks, whose vows of sobriety certainly did not lessen their
appreciation of the good things of this life,
10

and the produce of whose vineyards usually enjoyed a higher reputation
than that of their lay neighbours, were clever enough to seize upon the
most eligible sites, and quick to spread abroad the fame of their wines.
St. Remi, baptiser of Clovis, the first Christian king in France, at the
end of the fifth century left by will, to various churches, the
vineyards which he owned at Reims and Laon, together with the “vilains”
employed in their cultivation. Some three and a half centuries later we
find worthy Bishop Pardulus of Laon imitating Paul’s advice to Timothy,
and urging Archbishop Hincmar to drink of the wines of Epernay and Reims
for his stomach’s sake. The crusade-preaching Pope, Urban      II., who
was born among the vineyards of the Champagne, dearly loved the wine of
Ay; and his energetic appeals to the princes of Europe to take up arms
for the deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre may have owed some of their
eloquence to his favourite beverage.

The red wine of the Champagne sparkled on the boards of monarchs in
the Middle Ages when they sat at meat amidst their mailclad chivalry,
and quaffed mighty beakers to the confusion of the Paynim. Henry of
Andely has sung in his fabliau of the “Bataille des Vins,” how,
when stout Philip Augustus and his chaplain constituted themselves the
earliest known wine-jury, the crûs of Espernai, Auviler,
Chaalons, and Reims were amongst those which found most favour in their
eyes, though nearly a couple of centuries elapsed before Eustace
Deschamps recorded in verse the rival merits of those of Cumières and
Ay. King Wenceslaus of Bohemia, a      mighty toper, got so royally
drunk day after day upon the vintages of the Champagne, that he forgot
all about the treaty with Charles VI., that had formed the pretext of
his visit to France, and would probably have lingered, goblet in hand,
in the old cathedral city till the day of his death, but for the
presentation of a little account for wine consumed, which sobered him to
repentance and led to his abrupt departure. Dunois, Lahire,
Xaintrailles, and their fellows, when they rode with Joan of Arc to the
coronation of Charles VII., drank the same generous fluid, through
helmets
11

barred, to the speedy expulsion of the detested English from the soil of
France.

The vin d’Ay       vinum Dei as Dominicus Baudoin punningly
styled it       was, according to old Paulmier, the ordinary drink of
the kings and princes of his day. It fostered bluff King Hal’s fits of
passion and the tenth Leo’s artistic extravagance; consoled
Francis      I. for the field of Pavia, and solaced his great rival in
his retirement at St. Just. All of them had their commissioners at Ay to
secure the best wine for their own consumption. Henri Quatre, whose
vendangeoir is still shown in the village, held the wine in such
honour that he was wont to style himself the Seigneur d’Ay, just as
James of Scotland was known as the Gudeman of Ballangeich. When his son,
Louis XIII., was crowned, the wines of the Champagne were the only
growths allowed to grace the board at the royal banquet. Freely too did
they flow at the coronation feast of the Grand Monarque, when the crowd
of assembled courtiers, who quaffed them in his honour, hailed them as
the finest wines of the day.

But the wines which drew forth all these encomiums were far from
resembling the champagne of modern times. They were not, as has been
asserted, all as red as burgundy and as flat as port; for at the close
of the sixteenth, century some of them were of a fauve or
yellowish hue, and of the intermediate tint between red and white which
the French call clairet, and which our old writers translate as
the “complexion of a cherry” or the “colour of a partridge’s eye.” But,
as a rule, the wines of the Champagne up to this period closely
resembled those produced in the adjacent province, where Charles the
Bold had once held sway; a      resemblance, no doubt, having much to do
with the great medical controversy regarding their respective merits
which arose in 1652. In that year a young medical student, hard pressed
for the subject of his inaugural thesis, and in the firm faith that


“None but a clever dialectician
Can hope to become a good physician,
And that logic plays an important part
In the mystery of the healing art,”

12


propounded the theory that the wines of Burgundy were preferable to
those of the Champagne, and that the latter were irritating to the
nerves and conducive to gout. The faculty of medicine at Reims naturally
rose in arms at this insolent assertion. They seized their pens and
poured forth a deluge of French and Latin in defence of the wines of
their province, eulogising alike their purity, their brilliancy of
colour, their exquisite flavour and perfume, their great keeping powers,
and, in a word, their general superiority to the Burgundy growths. The
partisans of the latter were equally prompt in rallying in their
defence, and the faculty of medicine of Beaune, having put their learned
periwigs together, enunciated their views and handled their opponents
without mercy. The dispute spread to the entire medical profession, and
the champions went on pelting each other with pamphlets in prose and
tractates in verse, until in 1778       long after the bones of the
original disputants were dust and their lancets rust       the faculty
of Paris, to whom the matter was referred, gave a final and formal
decision in favour of the wines of the Champagne.

Meanwhile an entirely new kind of wine, which was to carry the name
of the province producing it to the uttermost corners of the earth, had
been introduced. On the picturesque slopes of the Marne, about fifteen
miles from Reims, and some four or five miles from Epernay, stands the
little hamlet of Hautvillers, which, in pre-revolutionary days, was a
mere dependency upon a spacious abbey dedicated to St. Peter. Here the
worthy monks of the order of St. Benedict had lived in peace and
prosperity for several hundred years, carefully cultivating the acres of
vineland extending around the abbey, and religiously exacting a tithe of
all the other wine pressed in their district. The revenue of the
community thus depending in no small degree upon the vintage, it was
natural that the post of “celerer” should be one of importance. It
happened that about the year 1688 this office was conferred upon a
worthy monk named Perignon. Poets and roasters, we know, are born, and
not made; and the monk in question seems to have been a heaven-born
cellarman, with a
13

strong head and a discriminating palate. The wine exacted from the
neighbouring cultivators was of all qualities       good, bad, and
indifferent; and with the spirit of a true Benedictine, Dom Perignon hit
upon the idea of “marrying” the produce of one vineyard with that of
another. He had noted that one kind of soil imparted fragrance and
another generosity, and discovered that a white wine could be made from
the blackest grapes, which would keep good, instead of turning yellow
and degenerating like the wine obtained from white ones. Moreover, the
happy thought occurred to him that a piece of cork was a much more
suitable stopper for a bottle than the flax dipped in oil which had
heretofore served that purpose.

The white, or, as it was sometimes styled, the grey wine of the
Champagne grew famous, and the manufacture spread throughout the
province, but that of Hautvillers held the predominance. To Dom Perignon
the abbey’s well-stocked cellar was a far cheerfuller place than the
cell. Nothing delighted him more than


“To come down among this brotherhood
Dwelling for ever underground,
Silent, contemplative, round and sound,
Each one old and brown with mould,
But filled to the lips with the ardour of youth,
With the latent power and love of truth,
And with virtues fervent and manifold.”

Ever busy among his vats and presses, barrels and bottles, Perignon
alighted upon a discovery destined to be most important in its results.
He found out the way of making an effervescent wine       a      wine
that burst out of the bottle and overflowed the glass, that was twice as
dainty to the taste, and twice as exhilarating in its effects. It was at
the close of the seventeenth century that this discovery was
made       when the glory of the Roi Soleil was on the wane, and with it
the splendour of the Court of Versailles. Louis XIV., for whose especial
benefit liqueurs had been invented, recovered a gleam of his youthful
energy as he sipped the creamy foaming vintage that enlivened his dreary
têtes-à-têtes with the widow of Scarron. It found its chief
patrons
14

however, amongst the bands of gay young roysterers, the future <ins
class = "mycorr" title = "printed without accent">roues of
the Regency, whom the Duc d’Orléans and the Duc de Vendôme had gathered
round them, at the Palais Royal and at Anet. It was at one of the famous
soupers d’Anet that the Marquis de Sillery       who had turned
his sword into a pruning-knife, and applied himself to the cultivation
of his paternal vineyards on the principles inculcated by the celerer of
St. Peter’s       first introduced the sparkling wine bearing his name.
The flower-wreathed bottles, which, at a given signal, a      dozen of
blooming young damsels scantily draped in the guise of Bacchanals placed
upon the table, were hailed with rapture, and thenceforth sparkling wine
was an indispensable adjunct at all the petits soupers of the
period. In the highest circles the popping of champagne-corks seemed to
ring the knell of sadness, and the victories of Marlborough were in a
measure compensated for by this happy discovery.

Why the wine foamed and sparkled was a mystery even to the very
makers themselves; for as yet Baume’s <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"first ‘e’ unreadable">aerometer was unknown, and the connection
between sugar and carbonic acid undreamt of. The general belief was that
the degree of effervescence depended upon the time of year at which the
wine was bottled, and that the rising of the sap in the vine had
everything to do with it. Certain wiseacres held that it was influenced
by the age of the moon at the time of bottling; whilst others thought
the effervescence could be best secured by the addition of spirit, alum,
and various nastinesses. It was this belief in the use and efficacy of
drugs that led to a temporary reaction against the wine about 1715, in
which year Dom Perignon departed this life. In his latter days he had
grown blind, but his discriminating taste enabled him to discharge his
duties with unabated efficiency to the end. Many of the tall tapering
glasses invented by him have been emptied to the memory of the old
Benedictine, whose remains repose beneath a black marble slab in the
chancel of the archaic abbey church of Hautvillers.








THE VINEYARDS AND ABBEY OF HAUTVILLERS. (p. 14)

Time and the iconoclasts of the great Revolution have spared but
little of the royal abbey of St. Peter where Dom
15

Perignon lighted upon his happy discovery of the effervescent quality of
champagne. The quaint old church, scraps of which date back to the 12th
century, the remnants of the cloisters, and a couple of ancient
gateways, marking the limits of the abbey precincts, are all that remain
to testify to the grandeur of its past. It was the proud boast of the
brotherhood that it had given nine archbishops to the see of Reims, and
two-and-twenty abbots to various celebrated monasteries, but this pales
beside the enduring fame it has acquired from having been the cradle of
the sparkling vintage of the Champagne.








THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MESSRS. CHARLES FARRE       CO., AT HAUTVILLERS.
(p.      15)

It was in the budding springtime when we made our pilgrimage to
Hautvillers across the swollen waters of the Marne at Epernay. Our way
lay for a time along a straight level poplar-bordered road, with verdant
meadows on either hand, then diverged sharply to the left and we
commenced ascending the vine-clad hills, on a narrow plateau of which
the church and abbey remains are picturesquely perched. Vines climb the
undulating slopes to the summit of the plateau, and wooded heights rise
up beyond, affording shelter from the bleak winds sweeping over from the
north. As we near the village of Hautvillers we notice on our left hand
a couple of isolated buildings overlooking a small ravine with their
bright tiled roofs flashing in the sunlight. These prove to be a branch
establishment of Messrs. Charles Farre and Co., a      well-known
champagne firm having its head-quarters at Reims. The grassy space
beyond, dotted over with low stone shafts giving light and ventilation
to the cellars beneath, is alive with workmen unloading waggons densely
packed with new champagne bottles, while under a neighbouring shed is a
crowd of women actively engaged in washing the bottles as they are
brought to them. The large apartment aboveground, known as the
cellier, contains wine in cask already blended, and to bottle
which preparations are now being made. On descending into the cellars,
which, excavated in the chalk and of regular construction, comprise a
series of long, lofty, and well-ventilated galleries, we find them
stocked with bottles of fine wine reposing in huge compact piles ready
for transport to the head establishment, where they
16

will undergo their final manipulation. The cellars consist of two
stories, the lowermost of which has an iron gate communicating with the
ravine already mentioned. On passing out here and looking up behind we
see the buildings perched some hundred feet above us, hemmed in on every
side with budding vines.






THE PORTE DES PRESSOIRS, HAUTVILLERS.

The church of Hautvillers and the remains of the neighbouring abbey
are situated at the farther extremity of the village, at the end of its
one long street, named, pertinently enough, the Rue de Bacchus. Passing
through an unpretentious gateway we find ourselves in a spacious
courtyard, bounded by buildings somewhat complex in character. On our
right rises the tower of the church with the remains of the old
cloisters, now walled-in and lighted by small square windows, and
propped up by heavy buttresses. To the left stands the residence of the
bailiff, and beyond it an 18th-century château on the site of the
17

abbot’s house, the abbey precincts being bounded on this side by a
picturesque gateway tower leading to the vineyards, and known as the
“porte des pressoirs,” from its contiguity to the existing wine-presses.
Huge barn-like buildings, stables, and cart-sheds inclose the court on
its remaining sides, and roaming about are numerous live stock,
indicating that what remains of the once-famous royal abbey of St. Peter
has degenerated into an ordinary farm. To-day the abbey buildings and
certain of its lands are the property of Messrs. <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "dieresis missing in original">Moët and Chandon, the great
champagne manufacturers of Epernay, who maintain them as a farm, keeping
some six-and-thirty cows there with the object of securing the necessary
manure for the numerous vineyards which they own hereabouts.





The dilapidated cloisters, littered with old casks, farm implements,
and the like, preserve ample traces of their former architectural
character, and the Louis Quatorze gateway on the northern side of the
inclosure still displays above its arch a grandiose carved shield, with
surrounding palm-branches and half-obliterated bearings. Vine-leaves and
bunches of grapes
18

decorate some of the more ancient columns inside the church, and
grotesque mediæval monsters, such as monkish architects habitually
delighted in, entwine themselves around the capitals of others. The
stalls of the choir are elaborately carved with cherubs’ heads,
medallions and figures of saints, cupids supporting shields, and free
and graceful arabesques of the epoch of the Renaissance. In the chancel,
close by the altar steps, are a couple of black marble slabs, with Latin
inscriptions of dubious orthography, the one to Johannes Royer, who died
in 1527, and the other setting forth the virtues and merits of Dom
Petrus Perignon, the discoverer of champagne. In the central aisle a
similar slab marks the resting-place of Dom Thedoricus
Ruynart       obit 1709       an ancestor of the Reims Ruinarts, and
little square stones interspersed among the tiles with which the side
aisles of the church are paved record the deaths of other members of the
Benedictine brotherhood during the 17th and 18th centuries. Several
large pictures grace the walls of the church, the most interesting one
representing St. Nivard, Bishop of Reims, and his friend, St. Berchier,
designating to some mediæval architect the site the contemplated abbey
of St. Peter was to occupy. There was a monkish legend that about the
middle of the 7th century this pair of saints set out in search of a
suitable site for the future monastery. The way was long, the day was
warm, and St. Nivard and St. Berchier as yet were simply mortal. Weary
and faint, they sat them down to rest at a spot identified by tradition
with a vineyard at Dizy, belonging to-day to the Messrs. Bollinger, but
at that period forming part of the forest of the Marne. St. Nivard fell
asleep with his head on his companion’s lap, and the one in a dream, and
the other with waking eyes, saw a snow-white dove       the same, firm
believers in miracles suggested, which had brought down the holy oil for
the anointment of Clovis at his coronation at Reims       flutter
through the wood, and finally alight on the stump of a tree.

In those superstitious times such a significant omen was not to be
disregarded, the site thus miraculously indicated was at once decided
upon, the high altar of the abbey church being
19

erected upon the precise spot where the tree stood on which the
snow-white dove had alighted.





The celerer of St. Peter’s found worthy successors, and thenceforward
the manufacture and the popularity of champagne went on steadily
increasing, until to-day its production is carried on upon a scale and
with an amount of painstaking care that would astonish its originator.
For good champagne does not rain down from the clouds, or gush out from
the rocks, but is the result of incessant labour, patient skill, minute
precaution, and careful observation. In the first place, the soil
imparts to the natural wine a special quality which it has been found
impossible to imitate in any other quarter of the globe. To the wine of
Ay it lends a flavour of peaches, and to that of Avenay the savour of
strawberries; the vintage of Hautvillers, though fallen from its former
high estate, is yet marked by an unmistakably nutty taste; while that of
Pierry smacks of the locally-abounding flint, the well-known pierre à
fusil flavour. So on the principle that a little leaven leavens the
whole lump, the produce of grapes grown in the more favoured vineyards
is added in certain proportions to secure certain special
characteristics, as well as to maintain a fixed standard of
excellence.

Red Wine formerly celebrated.


With
the exception of certain famous vineyards of the Rhône, the vinelands of
the Champagne may, perhaps, be classed among the most picturesque of the
more notable vine districts of France. Between Paris and Epernay even,
the banks of the Marne present
21

a series of scenes of quiet beauty. The undulating ground is everywhere
cultivated like a garden. Handsome châteaux and charming country houses
peep out from amid luxuriant foliage. Picturesque antiquated villages
line the river’s bank or climb the hill sides, and after leaving La
Ferté-sous-Jouarre, the cradle of the Condés, all the more favoured
situations commence to be covered with vines.

This is especially the case in the vicinity of
Château-Thierry       the birthplace of La Fontaine       where the view
is shut in on all sides by vine-clad slopes, which the spring frosts
seldom spare. Hence merely one good vintage out of four gladdens the
hearts of the peasant proprietors, who find eager purchasers for their
produce among the lower-class manufacturers of champagne. In the same
way the petit vin de Chierry, dexterously prepared and
judiciously mingled with other growths, often figures as “Fleur de
Sillery” or “Ay Mousseux.” In reality it is not until we have passed the
ornate modern Gothic château of Boursault, erected in her declining
years by the wealthy Veuve Clicquot, by far the shrewdest manipulator of
the sparkling products of Ay and Bouzy of her day, and the many towers
and turrets of which, rising above umbrageous trees, crown the loftiest
height within eyeshot of Epernay, that we find ourselves within that
charmed circle of vineyards whence champagne       the wine, not merely
of princes, as it has been somewhat obsequiously termed, but essentially
the vin de société       is derived.

The vinelands in the vicinity of Epernay, and consequently near the
Marne, are commonly known as the “Vineyards of the River,” whilst those
covering the slopes in the neighbourhood of Reims are termed the
“Vineyards of the Mountain.” The Vineyards of the River comprise three
distinct divisions       first, those lining the right bank of the Marne
and enjoying a southern and south-eastern aspect, among which are Ay,
Hautvillers, Cumières, Dizy, and Mareuil; secondly, the Côte d’Epernay
on the left bank of the river, of which Pierry, Moussy, and Vinay form
part; and thirdly, the Côte d’Avize (the region par excellence of
white grapes), which stretches towards the south-east, and
22

includes the vinelands of Cramant, Avize, Oger, Le Mesnil, and Vertus.
The entire vineyard area is upwards of 40,000 acres.

The Champagne vineyards most widely celebrated abroad are those of Ay
and Sillery, although the last-named are really the smallest in the
Champagne district. Ay, distant only a few minutes by rail from Epernay,
is in the immediate centre of the vinelands of the river, having Mareuil
and Avenay on the east, and Dizy, Hautvillers, and Cumières on the west.
Sillery, on the other hand, lies at the foot of the so-called Mountain
of Reims, and within an hour’s drive of the old cathedral city.

The pleasantest season of the year to visit the Champagne is
certainly during the vintage. When this is about to commence, the
vintagers       some of whom come from Sainte Menehould, forty miles
distant, while others hail from as far as Lorraine       are summoned at
daybreak by beat of drum in the market-places of the villages adjacent
to the vineyards, and then and there a price is made for the day’s
labour. This is generally either a franc and a half, with food
consisting of three meals, or two francs and a half without food,
children being paid a franc and a half. The rate of wage satisfactorily
arranged, the gangs start off to the vineyards, headed by their
overseers.

It was on one of those occasional sunshiny days in the early part of
October (1871) when I first visited Ay, the vineyard of golden plants,
the unique premier crû of the Wines of the River. The road lay
between two rows of closely-planted poplar-trees reaching almost to the
village of Dizy, whose quaint grey church tower, with its gabled roof,
is dominated by the neighbouring vine-clad slopes, which extend from
Avenay to Venteuil, some few miles beyond Hautvillers, the cradle, so to
speak, of the vin mousseux of the Champagne.

Everywhere was bustle and excitement; every one was big with the
business in hand. In these ordinarily quiet little villages the majority
of the inhabitants were afoot, the feeble feminine half with the
juveniles threading their way through the rows of vines half-way up the
mountain, basket on arm, while the sturdy masculine portion were mostly
passing to and fro between
23

the press-houses and the wine-shops. Carts piled up with baskets, or
crowded with peasants from a distance on their way to the vineyards,
jostled the low railway trucks laden with bran-new casks, and the
somewhat rickety cabriolets of the agents of the big champagne houses,
reduced to clinch their final bargain for a hundred or more
pièces of the peerless wine of Ay, beside the reeking
wine-press.

There was a pleasant air of jollity over all, for in the
wine-producing districts every one participates in the interest excited
by the vintage, which influences the takings of all the artificers and
all the tradespeople, bringing grist to the mill of the baker and the
bootmaker, as well as to the café and the cabaret. The various
contending interests were singularly satisfied, the vintagers getting
their two francs and a half a day, and the men at the pressoirs their
three francs and their food. The plethoric
commissionaires-en-vins wiped their perspiring foreheads with
satisfaction at having at last secured the full number of hogsheads they
had been instructed to buy       at a high figure it was true, still
this was no disadvantage to them, as their commission mounted up all the
higher. And, as regarded the small vine proprietors, even the
thickest-skulled among them, who make all their calculations on their
fingers, could see at a glance that they were gainers, for, although the
crop was no more than half an average one, yet, thanks to the
ill-disguised anxiety of the agents to secure all the wine they
required, prices had gradually crept up until they doubled those of
ordinary years, and this with only half the work in the vineyard and at
the wine-press to be done.

On leaving Dizy the road runs immediately at the base of the
vine-clad slopes, broken up by an occasional conical peak detaching
itself from the mass, and tinted from base to summit with
richly-variegated hues, in which deep purple, yellow, green, grey, and
crimson by turns predominate. Dotting these slopes like a swarm of huge
ants are a crowd of men, women, and children, intent on stripping the
vines of their luscious-looking fruit. The men are mostly in blue
blouses, and the women in closely-fitting neat white caps, or wearing
old-fashioned
24

unbleached straw-bonnets of the contemned coal-scuttle type. They detach
the grapes with scissors or hooked knives, technically termed
“serpettes,” and in some vineyards proceed to remove all damaged,
decayed, or unripe fruit from the bunches before placing them in the
baskets hanging on their arms, the contents of which are from time to
time emptied into a larger basket resembling a deep clothes-basket in
shape, numbers of these being dispersed about the vineyard for the
purpose, and invariably in the shade. When filled they are carried by a
couple of men to the roadside, along which dwarf stones carved with
initials, and indicating the boundaries of the respective properties,
are encountered every eight or ten yards, into such narrow strips are
the vineyards divided. Large carts with railed open sides are
continually passing backwards and forwards to pick these baskets up, and
when one of them has secured its load it is driven slowly       in order
that the grapes may not be shaken       to the neighbouring pressoir, so
extreme is the care observed throughout every stage of the process of
champagne manufacture.

In many of the vineyards the grapes are inspected in bulk instead of
in detail before being sent to the wine-press. The hand-baskets, when
filled, are all brought to a particular spot, where their contents are
minutely examined by some half-dozen men and women, who pluck off all
the bruised, rotten, and unripe berries, and fling them aside into a
separate basket. In one vineyard we came upon a party of girls,
congregated round a wicker sieve perched on the top of a large tub by
the roadside, who were busy sorting the grapes, pruning away the
diseased stalks, and picking off all the doubtful berries, and letting
the latter fall through the interstices of the sieve, the sound fruit
being deposited in large baskets standing by their side, which, as soon
as filled, were conveyed to the pressoir.









A VINTAGE SCENE IN THE CHAMPAGNE. (p. 24)

The picking ordinarily commences with daylight, and the vintagers
assert that the grapes gathered at sunrise always produce the lightest
and most limpid wine. Moreover by plucking the grapes when the early
morning sun is upon them they are
25

believed to yield a fourth more juice. Later on in the day, too, spite
of all precautions, it is impossible to prevent some of the detached
grapes from partially fermenting, which frequently suffices to give a
slight excess of colour to the must, a      thing especially to be
avoided       no matter how rich and ripe the fruit may be       in a
high-class champagne. When the grapes have to be transported in open
baskets for some distance to the press-house, jolting along the road
either in carts or on the backs of mules, and exposed to the torrid rays
of a bright autumnal sun, the juice expressed from the fruit, however
gently the latter may be squeezed, is occasionally of a positive purple
tinge, and consequently useless for conversion into champagne.

On the right of the road leading from Dizy to Ay we pass a vineyard
called Le Léon, which tradition asserts to be the one whence Pope Leo
the Magnificent, the patron of Michael Angelo, Raffaelle, and Da Vinci,
drew his supply of Ay wine. The village of Ay lies right before us at
the foot of the vine-clad slopes, with the tapering spire of its ancient
church rising above the neighbouring hills and cutting sharply against
the bright blue sky. The vineyards, which spread themselves over a
calcareous declivity, have mostly a full southern aspect, and the
predominating vines are those known as golden plants, the fruit of which
is of a deep purple colour. After these comes the plant vert
doré, and then a moderate proportion of the plant gris, the
latter a white variety, as its name implies. A      limited quantity of
wine from white grapes is likewise made in the neighbouring vineyards of
Dizy.

We visited the pressoir of the principal producer of vin brut
at Ay, who, although the owner of merely five hectares, or about twelve
and a half acres of vines, expected to make as many as 1,500 pièces of
wine that year, mainly of course from grapes purchased from other
growers. One peculiarity of the Champagne district is that, contrary to
the prevailing practice in the other wine-producing regions of France,
where the owner of even a single acre of vines will crush his grapes
himself, only a limited number of vine-proprietors press their own
grapes. The
26

large champagne houses, possessing vineyards, always have their
pressoirs in the neighbourhood, and other large vine-proprietors will
press the grapes they grow, but the multitude of small cultivators
invariably sell the produce of their vineyards to one or other of the
former at a certain rate, either by weight or else per caque,
a      measure estimated to hold sixty kilogrammes (equal to <ins class
= "mycorr" title = "spacing typical for this text">132lbs.) of
grapes. The price which the fruit fetches varies of course according to
the quality of the vintage and the requirements of the manufacturers. In
1873, in all the higher-class vineyards, as much as two francs and a
quarter per kilogramme (10d. per lb.) were paid, or between treble and
quadruple the average price. And yet the vintage was a most
unsatisfactory one owing to the deficiency of sun and abundance of wet
throughout the summer. The market, however, was in great need of wine,
and the fruit while still ungathered was bought up at most exorbitant
prices by the spéculateurs who supply the vin brut to the
champagne manufacturers.

Carts laden with grapes were continually arriving at the pressoir,
and after discharging their loads, and having them weighed, kept driving
off for fresh ones. Four powerful presses of recent invention, each
worked by a large fly-wheel requiring four sturdy men to turn it, were
in operation. The grapes were spread over the floor of the press in a
compact mass, and on being subjected to pressure       again and again
repeated, the first squeeze only giving a high-class wine       the must
filtered through a wicker basket into the reservoir beneath, whence,
after remaining a certain time to allow of its ridding itself of the
grosser lees, it is pumped through a gutta-percha tube into the casks.
The wooden stoppers of the bungholes, instead of being fixed tightly in
the apertures, are simply laid over them, and after the lapse of ten or
twelve days fermentation usually commences, and during its progress the
must, which is originally of a pale pink tint, fades to a light straw
colour. The wine usually remains undisturbed until Christmas, when it is
drawn off into fresh casks, and delivered to the purchaser.

On our way from Ay to Mareuil, along the lengthy Rue de
27

Châlons, we looked in at the little auberge at the corner of the
Boulevard du Sud, where we found a crowd of coopers and others connected
in some way with the vintage taking their cheerful glasses round. The
walls of the room were appropriately enough decorated with capering
bacchanals squeezing bunches of purple grapes and flourishing their
thyrsi about in a very tipsy fashion. All the talk       and there was
an abundance of it       had reference to the yield of this particular
vintage and the high rate the Ay wine had realised. Eight hundred francs
the pièce of two hundred litres, equal to forty-four gallons, appeared
to be the price fixed by the agents of the great champagne houses, and
at this figure the bulk of the vintage was disposed of before a single
grape passed through the wine-press.

At Mareuil, which is scarcely more than a mile from Ay, owing to the
steepness of the slopes and to the roads through the vineyards being
impracticable for carts, the grapes were being conveyed to the
press-houses in baskets slung across the backs of mules and donkeys,
who, on account of their known partiality for the ripe fruit, were most
of them muzzled while thus employed. The vin brut here, inferior
of course to that of Ay, found a ready market at from five to six
hundred francs the pièce.





From Mareuil we proceeded to Avenay, a tumbledown little village in
the direction of Reims, and the vineyards of which were of greater
repute in the 13th century than they are to-day. Its best wine, extolled
by Saint Evremond, the epicurean Frenchman, who emigrated to the gay
court of Charles      II. at Whitehall to escape a gloomy cell in the
Bastille, is vintaged up the slopes of Mont Hurlé. At Avenay we found
the yield had been little more than the third of an average one, and
that the wine from the first pressure of the grapes had been sold for
five hundred francs the pièce. Here we tasted some very fair still red
wine, made from the same grapes as champagne, remarkably deep in colour,
full of body, and with that slight sweet bitterish flavour
characteristic of certain of the better-class growths of the south of
France. On leaving Avenay we ascended the hills to Mutigny, and wound
28

round thence to Cumières, on the banks of the Marne, finding the vintage
in full operation all throughout the route. The vineyards of
Cumières       classed as a second crû       join those of Hautvillers
on the one side and Damery on the other       the latter a cosy little
river-side village, where the “bon Roi Henri” sought relaxation
from the turmoils of war in the society of the fair Anne du
Puy       “sa belle hôtesse,” as the gallant Béarnais was wont to
style her. Damery too claims to be the birthplace of Adrienne
Lecouvreur, the celebrated actress of the Regency, and mistress of the
Maréchal de Saxe who coaxed her out of her £30,000 of savings to enable
him to prosecute his suit with the obese Anna Iwanowna, niece of Peter
the Great, which, had he only been successful in, would have secured the
future hero of Fontenoy the coveted dukedom of Courland.

The vineyards of the Côte d’Epernay, south of the Marne, extend
eastward from beyond Boursault, on whose wooded height Madame Clicquot
built her fine château, in which her granddaughter,
29

the Comtesse de Mortemart, to-day resides. They then follow the course
of the river, and after winding round behind Epernay diverge towards the
south-west. The vines produce only black grapes, and many of the
vineyards are of great antiquity, one at Epernay, known as the Closet,
having been bequeathed under that name six and a half centuries ago to a
neighbouring Abbey of St. Martin. A      short drive along the high road
leading from Epernay to Troyes brings us to the village of Pierry cosily
nestling amongst groves of poplars in the valley of the Cubry, with some
half-score of châteaux of the last century belonging to well-to-do
wine-growers of the neighbourhood, screened from the road by umbrageous
gardens. Vines mount the slopes that rise around, the higher summits
being crowned with forest, while here and there some pleasant village
shelters itself under the brow of a lofty hill. Near Pierry many cellars
have been excavated in the chalky soil, to the flints prevalent in which
the village is said to owe its name.





The entrances to these cellars are closed by iron gateways, and on
the skirts of the vineyards we come upon whole rows of them
picturesquely overgrown with ivy.
30

Early in the last century the wine vintaged in the Clos St. Pierre,
belonging to an abbey of this name at Châlons, acquired a high
reputation through the care bestowed upon it by Brother Jean Oudart,
whose renown almost rivalled that of Dom Perignon himself, and to-day
the Pierry vineyards, producing exclusively black grapes, hold a high
rank among the second-class crûs of the Marne.

Crossing the Sourdon, a little stream which, bubbling up in the midst
of huge rocks in the forest of Epernay, rushes down the hills and
mingles its waters with that of the Cubry, we soon reach Moussy, where
the vineyards, spite of their long pedigree and southern aspect, also
rank as a second crû. Still skirting the vine-clad slopes we come to
Vinay, noted for an ancient grotto       the comfortless abode of some
rheumatic anchorite       and a pretended miraculous spring to which
fever-stricken pilgrims to-day credulously resort. The water may
possibly merit its renown, but the wine here produced is very inferior,
due no doubt to the class of vines, the meunier being the leading
variety cultivated. At Ablois St. Martin, picturesquely perched partway
up a slope in the midst of hills covered with vines and crowned with
forest trees, the Côte d’Epernay ends, and the produce becomes of a
choicer character.

The Côte d’Avize lies to the south-east, so that we have to retrace
our steps to Pierry and follow the road which there branches off,
leaving the vineyards of Chavot, Monthelon, and Grauves, of no
particular note, on our right hand. We pass through Cuis, where the
slopes, planted with both black and white varieties of vines, are
extremely abrupt, and eventually reach Cramant, one of the grand
premiers crûs of the Champagne. From the vineyards around this
picturesque little village, and extending along the somewhat precipitous
Côte de Saran       a      prominent object on which is M.      Moët’s
handsome château       there is vintaged a wine from white grapes
especially remarkable for lightness and delicacy and the richness of its
bouquet, and an admixture of which is essential to every first-class
champagne cuvée.

From Cramant the road runs direct to Avize, a large thriving
31

village, lying at the foot of vineyard slopes, where numerous champagne
firms have established themselves. Its prosperity dates from the
commencement of the last century, when the Count de Lhery cleared away
the remains of its ancient ramparts, filled up the moat, and planted the
ground with vines, the produce of which was found admirably suited for
the sparkling wines then coming into vogue. To-day the light delicate
wine of Avize is classed, like that of Cramant, as a premier crû.
It is the same with the wine of Oger, lying a little to the south, while
the neighbouring growths of Le Mesnil hold a slightly inferior rank. The
latter village and its grey Gothic church lie under the hill in the
midst of vines that almost climb the forest-crowned summit. The stony
soil hereabouts is said to be better adapted to the cultivation of white
than of black grapes, besides which the wines of Le Mesnil are
remarkable for their effervescent properties.

Vertus forms the southern limit of the Côte d’Avize, and the vineyard
slopes subsiding at their base into a broad expanse of fertile fields,
and crested as usual with dense forest, rise up behind the picturesque
old town which the English assailed and partly burnt five centuries ago,
spite of its fortifications, of which to-day a dilapidated gateway alone
remains. The church is ancient and curious, and a few quaint old houses
are here and there met with, notably one with a florid Gothic window
enriched with a moulding of grapes and vine-leaves. The vineyards of
Vertus were originally planted with vines from Burgundy, and in the 14th
century yielded a red wine held in high repute, while later on the
Vertus growths formed the favourite beverage of William III. of England.
To-day the growers find it more profitable to make white instead of red
wine from their crops of black grapes, the former commanding a good
price for conversion into vin mousseux, it being in the opinion
of some manufacturers especially valuable for binding a cuvée
together. The wine of Vertus ranks among the second-class champagne
crûs.

33

The
smallest of the Champagne vineyards are those of Sillery, and yet no
wine of the Marne enjoys a greater renown, due originally to the
intelligence and energy of the Maréchale d’Estrées, the clever daughter
of a Jew financier, who brought the wine of Sillery prominently into
notice during the latter half of the seventeenth century. She had
vineyards at Mailly, Verzy, and Verzenay, as well as at Sillery, and
concentrated their produce in the capacious cellars of her château,
afterwards sending it forth with her own guarantee, under the general
name of Sillery, which, like Aaron’s serpent, thus swallowed up the
others. The Maréchale’s social position enabled her to secure for her
wines the recognition they really merited, added to which she was a keen
woman of business. She also possessed much taste, and whenever she gave
one of her rare entertainments nothing could be more exquisite or more
magnificent. At the same time, she was so sordid that when her daughter,
who was covered with jewels, fell down at a ball, her first cry was, not
like Shylock’s, “my daughter,” but “my diamonds,” as rushing forward she
strove to pick up, not the fallen dancer, but her scattered gems.

The drive from Reims to Sillery has nothing attractive about it.
A      long, straight, level road bordered by trees intersects a broad
tract of open country, skirted on the right by the Petite Montagne of
Reims, with antiquated villages nestled among the dense woodland. After
crossing the Châlons line of railway       near where one of the new
forts constructed for the defence of Reims rises up behind the villages
and vineyards of Cernay and Nogent l’Abbesse       the country becomes
more undulating. Poplars border the broad Marne canal, and a low fringe
of foliage marks the course of the languid river Vesle, on the banks of
which is Taissy, famous in the old days for its wines, great favourites
with Sully, and which almost lured Henri Quatre from his allegiance to
the vintages of Ay and Arbois that he loved so well.

To the left rises Mont de la Pompelle, where the first Christians of
Reims suffered martyrdom, and where in 1658 the Spaniards under Montal,
when attempting to ravage the vineyards of the district, were repulsed
with terrible slaughter by the Remois
34

militia, led on by Grandpré. A      quarter of a century ago the low
ground on our right near Sillery was planted with vines by
M.      Jacquesson, the owner of the Sillery estate, and a large
champagne manufacturer at Châlons, who was anxious to resuscitate the
ancient reputation of the domain. Under the advice of Dr. Guyot, the
well-known writer on viticulture, he planted the vines in deep trenches,
which led to the vineyards being punningly termed Jacquesson’s
celery beds. To shield the vines from hailstorms prevalent in the
district, and the more dangerous spring frosts, so fatal to vines
planted in low-lying situations, long rolls of straw-matting were stored
close at hand with which to roof them over when needful. These
precautions were scarcely needed, however; the vines languished through
moisture at the roots, and eventually were mostly rooted      up.

After again crossing the railway, we pass the trim, restored turrets
of the famous château of Sillery, with its gateways, moats, and
drawbridges, flanked by trees and floral parterres. It was here that the
Maréchale d’Estrées carried on her successful business as a marchande
de vins, and the pragmatic and pedantic Comtesse de Genlis,
governess of the Orleans princes, spent, as she tells us, the happiest
days of her life. The few thriving vineyards of Sillery cover a gentle
eminence which rises out of the plain, and present on the one side an
eastern and on the other a western aspect. To-day the Vicomte de Brimont
and M.      Fortel of Reims, the latter of whom cultivates about forty
acres of vines, yielding ordinarily about 300 hogsheads, are the only
wine-growers at Sillery. Before pressing his grapes       of course for
sparkling wine       M.      Fortel has them thrown into a trough, at
the bottom of which are a couple of grooved cylinders, each about eight
inches in diameter, and revolving in contrary directions, the effect of
which, when set in motion, is to disengage the grapes partially from
their stalks. Grapes and stalks are then placed under the press, which
is on the old cyder-press principle, and the must runs into a reservoir
beneath, whence it is pumped into large vats, each holding from 250 to
500 gallons. Here it remains from six to eight hours, and is then run
off into casks, the spigots
35

of which are merely laid lightly over the holes, and in the course of
twelve days the wine begins to ferment. It now rests until the end of
the year, when it is drawn off into new casks and delivered to the
buyer, invariably one or other of the great champagne houses, who
willingly pay an exceptionally high price for it. The second and third
pressures of the grapes yield an inferior wine, and from the husks and
stalks eau-de-vie, worth about five shillings a gallon, is
distilled.

The wine known as Sillery sec is a full, dry, pleasant-flavoured, and
somewhat spirituous amber-coloured wine. Very little of it is made
now-a-days, and most that is comes from the adjacent vineyards of
Verzenay and Mailly, and is principally reserved by the growers for
their own consumption. One of these candidly admitted to me that the old
reputation of the wine had exploded, and that better white Bordeaux and
Burgundy wines were to be obtained for less money. In making dry
Sillery, which locally is esteemed as a valuable tonic, it is essential
that the grapes should be subjected to only slight pressure, while to
have it in perfection it is equally essential that the wine should be
kept for ten years in the wood according to some, and eight years in
bottle according to others, to which circumstance its high price is in
all probability to be attributed. In course of time it forms a deposit,
and has the disadvantage common to all the finer still wines of the
Champagne district of not travelling well.

Beyond Sillery the vineyards of Verzenay unfold themselves, spreading
over the extensive slopes and stretching to the summit of the steep
height to the right, where a windmill or two is perched. Everywhere the
vintagers are busy detaching the grapes with their little hook-shaped
serpettes, the women all wearing projecting, close-fitting
bonnets, as though needlessly careful of their anything but blonde
complexions. Long carts laden with baskets of grapes block the narrow
roads, and donkeys, duly muzzled, with baskets slung across their backs,
toil up and down the steeper slopes. Half way up the principal hill,
backed by a dense wood and furrowed with deep trenches, whence soil has
been removed for manuring the vineyards, is the
36

village of Verzenay, overlooking a veritable sea of vines. Rising up in
front of the old grey cottages, encompassed by orchards or gardens, are
the white walls and long red roofs of the vendangeoirs belonging to the
great champagne houses       Moët and Chandon, Clicquot, G.      H.
Mumm, Roederer, Deutz and Geldermann, and others       all teeming with
bustle and excitement, and with the vines almost reaching to their very
doors. Moët and Chandon have as many as eight presses in full work, and
own no less than 120 acres of vines on the neighbouring slopes, besides
the Clos de Romont       in the direction of Sillery, and yielding a
wine of the Sillery type       belonging to M.      Moët Romont. At
Messrs. G.      H. Mumm’s the newly-delivered grapes are either being
weighed and emptied into one of the pressoirs, or else receiving their
first gentle squeeze. Verzenay ranks as a premier crû, and for
three years in succession       1872, 3, and      4       its wines
fetched a higher price than either those of Ay or Bouzy. In 1873 the
vin brut commanded the exceptionally large sum of 1,030 francs
the hogshead of 44 gallons. All the inhabitants of Verzenay are vine
proprietors, and several million francs are annually received by them
for the produce of their vineyards from the manufacturers of champagne.
The wine of Verzenay, remarkable for its body and vinosity, has always
been held in high repute, which is more than can be said for the probity
of the inhabitants, for according to an old Champagne
saying       “Whenever at Verzenay ‘Stop thief’ is cried every one takes
to his heels.”









THE VINEYARDS OF VERZENAY. (p. 36.)

Just over the mountain of Reims is the village of Verzy, the
vineyards of which adjoin those of Verzenay, and are almost exclusively
planted with white grapes, the only instance of the kind to be met with
in the district. In the clos St. Basse, however       taking its name
from the abbey of St. Basle, of which the village was a dependency, and
where Edward III. of England had his head-quarters during the siege of
Reims       black grapes alone are grown, and its produce is almost on a
par with the wines of Verzenay. Southwards of Verzy are the third-class
crûs of Villers-Marmery and Trépail.

37

On leaving Reims on our excursion to the vineyards of Bouzy we pass the
quaint old church of St. Remi, one of the sights of the Champagne
capital, and notable among other things for its magnificent ancient
stained-glass windows, and the handsome modern tomb of the popular
Remois saint. It was here in the middle ages that that piece of priestly
mummery, the procession of the herrings, used to take place at dusk on
the Wednesday before Easter. Preceded by a cross the canons of the
church marched in double file up the aisles, each trailing a cord after
him, with a herring attached. Every one’s object was to tread on the
herring in front of him, and prevent his own herring from being trodden
upon by the canon who followed behind       a      difficult enough
proceeding which, if it did not edify, certainly afforded much amusement
to the lookers-on.

Soon after crossing the canal and the river Vesle we leave the grey
antiquated-looking village of Cormontreuil on our left, and traverse a
wide stretch of cultivated country streaked with patches of woodland.
Occasional windmills dot the distant heights, while villages nestle
among the trees up the mountain sides and in the quiet hollows. Soon a
few vineyards occupying the lower slopes, and thronged by bands of
vintagers, come in sight, and the country too gets more picturesque. We
pass successively on our right hand Rilly, producing a capital red wine,
then Chigny, and afterwards Ludes, all three more or less up the
mountain, with vines in all directions, relieved by a dark background of
forest trees. In the old days the Knights Templars of the Commanderie of
Reims had the right of vinage at Ludes, and exacted their modest
“pot” (about half a gallon) per pièce on all the wine the village
produced. On our left hand is Mailly, the vineyards of which join those
of Verzenay, and yield a wine noted for finesse and bouquet. From
the wooded knolls hereabouts a view is gained of the broad plains of the
Champagne, dotted with white villages and scattered homesteads among the
poplars and the limes, the winding Vesle glittering in the sunlight, and
the dark towers of Notre Dame de Reims, with all their rich Gothic
fretwork, rising majestically above the distant city.

38

At one vendangeoir we visited at Mailly between 350 and 400 pièces of
wine were being made at the rate of some thirty pièces during the long
day of twenty hours, five men being engaged in working the old-fashioned
press, closely resembling a cyder press, and applying its pressure
longitudinally. The must was emptied into large vats, holding about 450
gallons, and remained there for two or three days before being drawn off
into casks. Of the above thirty pièces, twenty resulting from the first
pressure were of the finest quality, four produced by the second
pressure were partly reserved to replace what the first might lose
during fermentation, the residue serving for second-class champagne. The
six pièces which came from the final pressure, after being mixed with
common wine of the district, were converted into champagne of inferior
quality.

We now cross the mountain, sight Ville-en-Selve       the village in
the wood       among the distant trees, and eventually reach Louvois,
whence the Grand Monarque’s domineering war minister derived his
marquisate, and where his château, a      plain but capacious edifice,
may still be seen nestled in a picturesque and fertile valley, and
surrounded by lordly pleasure grounds. Soon afterwards the vineyards of
Bouzy appear in sight, with the prosperous-looking little village rising
out of the plain at the foot of the vine-clad slopes stretching to
Ambonnay, and the glittering Marne streaking the hazy distance. The
commodious new church was indebted for its spire, we were told, to the
lucky gainer       who chanced to be a native of Bouzy       of the
great gold ingot lottery prize, value £16,000, drawn some years ago. The
Bouzy vineyards occupy a series of gentle inclines, and have the
advantage of a full southern aspect. The soil, which is of the customary
calcareous formation, has a marked ruddy tinge, indicative of the
presence of iron, to which the wine is in some degree indebted for its
distinguishing characteristics       its delicacy, spirituousness, and
pleasant bouquet. Vintagers are passing slowly in between the vines, and
carts laden with grapes come rolling over the dusty roads. The mountain
which rises behind is scored up its sides and fringed with foliage at
its
39

summit, and a small stone bridge crosses the deep ravine formed by the
swift descending winter torrents.








THE VINEYARDS OF BOUZY. (p. 38.)

The principal vineyard proprietors at Bouzy, which ranks, of course,
as a premier crû, are M.      Werlé, M.      Irroy, and Messrs.
Moët and Chandon, the first and last of whom have capacious vendangeoirs
here, M.      Irroy’s pressing-house being in the neighbouring village
of Ambonnay. M.      Werlé possesses at Bouzy from forty to fifty acres
of the finest vines, forming a considerable proportion of the entire
vineyard area. At the Clicquot-Werlé vendangeoir, containing as many as
eight presses, about 1,000 pièces of wine are made annually. At the time
of our visit, grapes gathered that morning were in course of delivery,
the big basketfuls being measured off in caques       wooden
receptacles, holding two-and-twenty gallons       while the florid-faced
foreman ticked them off with a piece of chalk on the head of an adjacent
cask.








PRESSING GRAPES AT M. WERLÉ’S VENDANGEOIR AT BOUZY. (p. 39)

As soon as the contents of some half-hundred or so of these baskets
had been emptied on to the floor of the press, the grapes undetached
from their stalks were smoothed compactly down, and a moderate pressure
was applied to them by turning a huge wheel, which caused the screw of
the press to act       a      gradual squeeze rather than a powerful
one, and given all at once, coaxing out, it was said, the finer
qualities of the fruit. The operation was repeated as many as six times;
the yield from the three first pressures being reserved for conversion
into champagne, while the result of the fourth squeeze would be applied
to replenishing the loss, averaging 7½ per cent., sustained by the must
during fermentation. Whatever comes from the fifth pressure is sold to
make an inferior champagne. The grapes are subsequently well raked
about, and then subjected to a couple of final squeezes, known as the
rébêche, and yielding a sort of piquette, given to the
workmen employed at the pressoir to drink.

The small quantity of still red Bouzy wine made by M. Werlé at the
same vendangeoir only claims to be regarded as a wine of especial mark
in good years. The grapes before being placed beneath the press are
allowed to remain in a vat for as many as
40

eight days. The must undergoes a long fermentation, and after being
drawn off into casks is left undisturbed for a couple of years. In
bottle, where, by the way, it invariably deposits a sediment, which is
indeed the case with all the wines of the Champagne, still or sparkling,
it will outlive, we were told, any Burgundy.

Still red Bouzy has a marked and agreeable bouquet and a most
delicate flavour, is deliciously smooth to the palate, and to all
appearances as light as a wine of Bordeaux, while in reality it is quite
as strong as Burgundy, to the finer crûs of which it bears a slight
resemblance. It was, I      learnt, most susceptible to travelling,
a      mere journey to Paris being, it was said, sufficient to sicken
it, and impart such a shock to its delicate constitution that it was
unlikely to recover from it. To attain perfection, this wine, which is
what the French term a vin vif, penetrating into the remotest
corners of the organ of taste, requires to be kept a couple of years in
wood and half-a-dozen or more years in bottle.

From Bouzy it was only a short distance along the base of the vine
slopes to Ambonnay, where there are merely two or three hundred acres of
vines, and where we found the vintage almost over. The village is girt
with fir trees, and surrounded by rising ground fringed with solid belts
or slender strips of foliage. An occasional windmill cuts against the
horizon, which is bounded here and there by scattered trees. Inquiring
for the largest vine proprietor we were directed to an open
porte-cochère, and on entering the large court encountered half-a-dozen
labouring men engaged in various farm occupations. Addressing one whom
we took to be the foreman, he referred us to a wiry little old man, in
shirt-sleeves and sabots, absorbed in the refreshing pursuit of turning
over a big heap of rich manure with a fork. He proved to be
M.      Oury, the owner of I forget how many acres of vines, and a
remarkably intelligent peasant, considering what dunderheads the French
peasants as a rule are, who had raised himself to the position of a
large vine proprietor. Doffing his sabots and donning a clean blouse, he
conducted us into his little salon, a      freshly-painted apartment
about eight
41

feet square, of which the huge fireplace occupied fully one-third, and
submitted patiently to our catechizing.

At Ambonnay, as at Bouzy, they had that year, M. Oury said, only half
an average crop; the caque of grapes had, moreover, sold for exactly the
same price at both places, and the wine had realised about 800 francs
the pièce. Each hectare (2½ acres) of vines had yielded 45 caques of
grapes, weighing some 2¾ tons, which produced 6½ pièces, equal to 286
gallons of wine, or at the rate of 110 gallons per acre. Here the grapes
were pressed four times, the yield from the second pressure being used
principally to make good the loss which the first sustained during its
fermentation. As the squeezes given were powerful ones, all the best
qualities of the grapes were by this time extracted, and the yield from
the third and fourth pressures would not command more than 80 francs the
pièce. The vintagers who came from a distance received either a franc
and a half per day and their food, consisting of three meals, or two
francs and a half without food, the children being paid thirty sous.
M.      Oury further informed us that every year vineyards came into the
market, and found ready purchasers at from fifteen to twenty thousand
francs the hectare, equal to an average price of £300 the acre. Owing to
the properties being divided into such infinitesimal portions, they were
rarely bought up by the large champagne houses, who preferred not to be
embarrassed with the cultivation of such tiny plots, but to buy the
produce from their owners.

There are other vineyards of lesser note in the neighbourhood of
Reims producing very fair wines which enter more or less into the
composition of champagne. Noticeable among these are Ville-Dommange and
Sacy, south-west of Reims, and Hermonville and St. Thierry       where
the Black Prince took up his quarters during the siege of
Reims       north-west of the city. The still red wine of St. Thierry,
which recalls the growths of the Médoc by its tannin, and those of the
Côte d’Or by its vinosity, is to-day almost a thing of the past, it
being found here as elsewhere more profitable to press the grapes for
sparkling in preference to still wine.

Protecting the Vines against them       Dr. Guyot’s System       The
Parasites that Prey upon the Vines.


In
the Champagne the old rule holds good       poor soil, rich product;
grand wine in moderate quantity. Four descriptions of vines are chiefly
cultivated, three of them yielding black grapes, and all belonging to
the Pineau variety, from which the grand Burgundy wines are produced,
and so styled from the clusters taking the conical form of the pine. The
first is the franc pineau, the plant doré of Ay, producing small round
grapes, with thickish skins of a bluish black tint, and sweet and
refined in flavour. The next is the plant vert doré, more robust and
more productive than
43

the former, but yielding a less generous wine, and the berries of which
are dark and oval, very thin skinned and remarkably sweet and juicy. The
third variety is the plant gris, or burot, as it is styled in the Côte
d’Or, a      somewhat delicate vine, whose fruit has a brownish tinge,
and yields a light and perfumed wine. The remaining species is a white
grape known as the épinette, a      variety of the pineau blanc, and
supposed by some to be identical with the chardonnet of Burgundy, which
yields the famous wine of Montrachet. It is met with all along the Côte
d’Avize, notably at Cramant, the delicate and elegant wine of which
ranks immediately after that of Ay and Verzenay. The épinette is a
prolific bearer, and its round transparent golden berries, which hang in
no very compact clusters, are both juicy and sweet. It ripens, however,
much later than either of the black varieties.

There are several other species of vines cultivated in the Champagne
vineyards, notably the common meunier, or miller, bearing black grapes,
and prevalent in the valley of Epernay, and which takes its name from
the circumstance of the young leaves appearing to have been sprinkled
with flour. There are also the black and white gouais, the meslier,
a      prolific white variety yielding a wine of fair quality, the black
and white gamais, the leading grape in the Mâconnais, and chiefly found
in the Vertus vineyards, together with the tourlon, the marmot, and half
a score of others.

The soil of the Champagne vineyards is chalk, with a mixture of
silica and light clay, combined with a varying proportion of oxide of
iron. The vines are almost invariably planted on rising ground, the
lower slopes which usually escape the spring frosts producing the best
wines. The new vines are placed very close together, there often being
as many as six within a square yard. When two or three years old they
are ready for the operation of provinage universally practised in the
Champagne, and which consists in burying in a trench, from 6 to 8 inches
deep, dug on one side of the plant, the two lowest buds of the two
principal shoots, left when the vine was pruned for this especial
purpose. The shoots thus laid underground are dressed with a light
44

manure, and in course of time take root and form new vines, which bear
during their second year. This operation is performed in the spring, and
is annually repeated until the vine is five years old, the plants thus
being in a state of continual progression, a      system which accounts
for the juvenescent aspect of the Champagne vineyards, where none of the
wood of the vines showing aboveground is more than three years old. When
the vine has attained its fifth year it is allowed to rest for a couple
of years, and then the pruning is resumed, the shoots being dispersed in
any direction throughout the vineyard. The plants remain in this
condition henceforward, merely requiring to be renewed from time to time
by judicious provining.





The vines are supported by stakes, when of oak costing sixty francs
the thousand; and as in the Champagne a close system of plantation is
followed, no less than 24,000 stakes are required on every acre of land,
making the cost per acre of propping up the vines upwards of £57, or
double what it is in the Médoc and quadruple what it is in Burgundy.
These stakes are set up in the spring of the year by men or women, the
former of whom force them into the ground by pressing against them with
their chest, which is protected with a shield of stout leather. The
women use a mallet, or have recourse to a special appliance, in working
which the foot plays the principal part. The latter method is the least
fatiguing, and in some localities
45

is practised by the men. An expert labourer will set up as many as 5,000
of these stakes in the course of the day. After the vines have been hoed
around their roots they are secured to the stakes, and the tops are
broken off at a shoot to prevent them from growing above the regulation
height, which is ordinarily from 30 to 33 inches. They are liberally
manured with a kind of compost formed of the loose friable soil dug out
from the sides of the mountain, and of supposed volcanic origin, mixed
with animal and vegetable refuse. The vines are shortened back while in
flower, and in the course of the summer the ground is hoed a second and
a third time, the object being, first, to destroy the superficial roots
of the vines and force the plants to live solely on their deep roots;
and, secondly, to remove all pernicious weeds from round about them.
After the third hoeing, which takes place in the middle of August, the
vines are left to themselves until the period of the vintage. When this
is over the stakes supporting the vines are pulled up and stacked
46

in compact masses, with their ends out of the ground, the vine, which is
left curled up in a heap, remaining undisturbed until the winter, when
the earth around it is loosened. In the month of February it is pruned
and sunk into the earth, as already described, so as to leave only the
new wood aboveground. Owing to the vines being planted so closely
together they starve one another, and numbers of them perish. When this
is the case, or the stems get broken during the vintage, their places
are filled up by provining.





The vignerons of the Champagne regard the numerous stakes which
support the vines as affording some protection against the white frosts
of the spring. To guard against the dreaded effects of these frosts,
which invariably occur between early dawn and sunrise, and the loss
arising from which is estimated to amount annually to 25 per cent. some
of the cultivators place heaps of hay, faggots, dead leaves,      c.,
about twenty yards apart, taking care to keep them moderately damp. When
a frost is feared the heaps on the side of the vineyard whence the wind
blows are set light to, whereupon the dense smoke which rises spreads
horizontally over the vines, producing the same result as an actual
cloud, intercepting the rays of the sun, warming the atmosphere, and
converting the frost into dew. Among other methods adopted to shield the
vines from frosts is the joining of branches of broom together in the
form of a fan, and afterwards fastening them to the end of a pole, which
is placed obliquely in the ground, so that the fan may incline over the
vine and protect it from the sun’s rays. A      single labourer can
plant, it is said, as many as eight thousand of these fans in the ground
in the course of a long day.

Dr. Guyot’s system of roofing the vines with straw matting, to
protect them alike against frost and hailstorms, is very generally
followed in low situations in the Champagne, the value of the wine
admitting of so considerable an expense being incurred. This matting,
which is about a foot and a half in width, and in rolls of great length,
is fastened either with twine or wire to the vine stakes, and it is
estimated that half-a-dozen
47

men can fix nearly 11,000 yards of it, or sufficient to roof over
2½      acres of vines, during an ordinary day.





Owing to the system of cultivation by rejuvenescence, and the
constant replenishing of the soil by well-compounded manures, the
Champenois <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "no hyphen in original">winegrowers
entertain great hopes that their vineyards
will escape the ravages of the phylloxera vastatrix. According to Dr.
Plonquet of Ay they are already the prey of no less than fifteen
varieties of insects, which feed upon the leaves, stalks, roots, or
fruit of the vines. Between 1850 and 1860 the vineyards of Ay were
devastated by the pyrale, a      species of caterpillar, which feeds on
the young leaves and shoots until the vine is left completely bare. The
insect eventually becomes transformed into a small white butterfly, and
deposits its eggs either in the crevices of the stakes or in the stalks
of the vine. All the efforts made to rid the vineyards of this scourge
proved ineffectual until the wet and cold weather of 1860 put a stop to
the insect’s ravages. More recently it has been discovered that its
attacks can be checked by sulphurous acid.

The
special characteristic of champagne is that its manufacture only just
commences where that of other wines ordinarily ends. The must flows
direct from the press into capacious reservoirs, whence it is drawn off
into large vats, and after being allowed to clear, is transferred to
casks holding some forty-four<a class = "tag" name = "tagA" id = "tagA"
href = "#noteA">A gallons each. Although the bulk of the new-made
49

wine is left to repose at the vendangeoirs until the commencement of the
following year, still when the vintage is over numbers of long narrow
carts laden with casks of it are to be seen rolling along the dusty
highways leading to those towns and villages in the Marne where the
manufacture of champagne is carried on. Chief amongst these is the
cathedral city of Reims, after which comes the rising town of Epernay,
stretching to the very verge of the river, then Ay, nestled between the
vine-clad slopes and the Marne canal, with the neighbouring village of
Mareuil, and finally Avize, in the centre of the white grape district
southwards of Epernay. Châlons, owing to its distance from the
vineyards, would scarcely draw its supply of wine until the new year.
The first fermentation lasts from a fortnight to a month, according as
to whether the wine be mou       that is, rich in sugar       or
the reverse. In the former case fermentation naturally lasts much longer
than when the wine is vert or green. This active fermentation is
converted into latent fermentation by transferring the wine to a cooler
cellar, as it is essential it should retain a large proportion of its
natural saccharine to ensure its future effervescence. The casks have
previously been completely filled, and their bungholes tightly stopped,
a      necessary precaution to guard the wine from absorbing oxygen, the
effect of which would be to turn it yellow and cause it to lose some of
its lightness and perfume. After being racked and fined, the produce of
the different vineyards is now ready for mixing together in accordance
with the traditional theories of the various manufacturers, and should
the vintage have been an indifferent one a certain proportion of old
reserved wine of a good year enters into the blend.

The mixing is usually effected in gigantic vats holding at times as
many as 12,000 gallons each, and having fan-shaped appliances inside,
which, on being worked by handles, ensure a complete amalgamation of the
wine. This process of marrying wine on a gigantic scale is technically
known as making the cuvée. Usually four-fifths of wine from black
grapes are tempered by one-fifth of the juice of white ones. It is
necessary that the
50

first should comprise a more or less powerful dash of the finer growths
both of the Mountain of Reims and of the River, while, as regards the
latter, one or other of the delicate vintages of the Côte d’Avize is
essential to the perfect cuvée. The aim is to combine and develop
the special qualities of the respective crûs, body and vinosity being
secured by the red vintages of Bouzy and Verzenay, softness and
roundness by those of Ay and Dizy, and lightness, delicacy, and
effervescence by the white growths of Avize and Cramant. The proportions
are never absolute, but vary according to the manufacturer’s style of
wine and the taste of the countries which form his principal markets.
The wine at this period being imperfectly fermented and crude, the
reader may imagine the delicacy and discrimination of palate requisite
to judge of the flavour, finesse, and bouquet which the cuvée is
likely eventually to develop.

These, however, are not the only matters to be considered. There is,
above everything, the effervescence, which depends upon the quantity of
carbonic acid gas the wine contains, and this, in turn, upon the amount
of its natural saccharine. If the gas be present in excess, there will
be a shattering of bottles and a flooding of cellars; and if there be a
paucity the corks will refuse to pop, and the wine to sparkle aright in
the glass. Therefore the amount of saccharine in the cuvée has to
be accurately ascertained by means of a glucometer; and if it fails to
reach the required standard, the deficiency is made up by the addition
of the purest sugar-candy. If, on the other hand, there be an excess of
saccharine, the only thing to be done is to defer the final blending and
bottling until the superfluous saccharine matter has been absorbed by
fermentation in the cask.

The cuvée completed, the blended wine, now resembling in taste
and colour an ordinary acrid white wine, and giving to the uninitiated
palate no promise of the exquisite delicacy and aroma it is destined to
develop, is drawn off again into casks for further treatment. This
comprises fining with some gelatinous substance, and, as a precaution
against ropiness and other maladies, liquid tannin is at the same time
frequently added to supply
51

the place of the natural tannin which has departed from the wine with
its reddish hue at the epoch of its first fermentation.

The operation of bottling the wine next ensues, when the Scriptural
advice not to put new wine into old bottles is rigorously followed. For
the tremendous pressure of the gas engendered during the subsequent
fermentation of the wine is such that the bottle becomes weakened and
can never be safely trusted again. It is because of this pressure that
the champagne bottle is one of the strongest made, as indicated by its
weight, which is almost a couple of pounds. To ensure this unusual
strength it is necessary that its sides should be of equal thickness and
the bottom of a uniform solidity throughout, in order that no particular
expansion may ensue from sudden changes of temperature. The neck must,
moreover, be perfectly round and widen gradually towards the shoulder.
In addition       and this is of the utmost consequence       the inside
ought to be perfectly smooth, as a rough interior causes the gas to make
efforts to escape, and thus renders an explosion imminent. The
composition of the glass, too, is not without its importance, as a
manufactory established for the production of glass by a new process
turned out champagne bottles charged with alkaline sulphurets, and the
consequence was that an entire cuvée was ruined by their use,
through the reciprocal action of the wine and these sulphurets. The
acids of the former disengaged hydrosulphuric acid, and instead of
champagne the result was a new species of mineral water.





Most of the bottles used for champagnes come from the factories of
Loivre (which supplies the largest quantity), Folembray, Vauxrot, and
Quiquengrogne, and cost on the average from 28 to 30 francs the hundred.
They are generally tested by a practised hand, who, by knocking them
sharply together, professes to be able to tell from the sound that they
give the substance of the glass and its temper. The washing of the
bottles is invariably performed by women, who at the larger
establishments accomplish it with the aid of machines, sometimes
provided with a revolving brush, although small glass beads
52

are more generally used by preference. After being washed every bottle
is minutely examined to make certain of its perfect purity.





With the different champagne houses the mode of bottling the wine,
which may take place any time between April and August, varies in some
measure, still the tirage, as this operation is called, is
ordinarily effected as follows:       The wine is emptied from the casks
into vats or tuns of varying capacity, whence it flows through pipes
into oblong reservoirs, each provided with a row of syphon taps, on to
which the bottles are slipped, and from which the wine ceases to flow
directly the bottles become filled. Men or lads remove the full bottles,
replacing them by empty ones, while other hands convey them to the
corkers, whose guillotine machines are incessantly in motion; next the
agrafeurs secure the corks by means of an iron staple, termed an
agrafe; and then the bottles are conveyed either to a capacious
apartment aboveground, known as a cellier, or to a cool cellar,
according
53

to the number of atmospheres the wine may indicate. It should be
explained that air compressed to half its volume acquires twice its
ordinary force, and to a quarter of its volume quadruple this
force       hence the phrase of two, four, or more atmospheres. The
exact degree of pressure is readily ascertained by means of a manometer,
an instrument resembling a pressure gauge, with a hollow screw at the
base which is driven through the cork of the bottle. A      pressure of
5¾      atmospheres constitutes what is styled a “grand mousseux,” and
the wine exhibiting it may be safely conveyed to the coolest
subterranean depths, for no doubt need be entertained as to its future
effervescent properties. Should the pressure, however, scarcely exceed
4      atmospheres, it is advisable to keep the wine in a cellier
aboveground that it may more rapidly acquire the requisite sparkling
qualities. If fewer than 4      atmospheres are indicated it would be
necessary to pour the wine back into the casks again, and add a certain
amount of cane sugar to it, but such an eventuality very rarely happens,
thanks to the scientific formulas and apparatus which enable the degree
of pressure the wine will show to be determined beforehand to a nicety.
Still mistakes are sometimes made, and there are instances where
charcoal fires have had to be lighted in the cellars to encourage the
effervescence to develop itself.

The bottles are placed in a horizontal position and stacked in rows
of varying length and depth, one above the other, to about the height of
a man, and with narrow laths between them. Thus they will spend the
summer providing all goes well, but in about three weeks’ time the
process of gas-making inside the bottles is at its height, and may cause
an undue number of them to burst. The glucometer notwithstanding, it is
impossible to check a certain amount of breakage, especially when a hot
season has caused the grapes, and consequently the raw wine, to be
sweeter than usual. Moreover when once casse or breakage sets in
on a large scale, the temperature of the cellar is raised by the volume
of carbonic acid gas let loose, which is not without its effect on the
remaining bottles. The only remedy is at once
54

to remove the wine to a lower temperature when this is practicable.
A      manufacturer of the pre-scientific days of the last century
relates how one year, when the wine was rich and strong, he only
preserved 120 out of 6,000 bottles; and it is not long since that
120,000 out of 200,000 were destroyed in the cellars of a well-known
champagne firm. Over-knowing purchasers still affect to select a wine
which has exploded in the largest proportion as being well up to the
mark as regards its effervescence, and profess to make inquiries as to
its performances in this direction.

It is evident that in spite of the teachings of science the bursting
of champagne bottles has not yet been reduced to a minimum, for whereas
in some cellars it averages 7 and 8 per cent., in others it rarely
exceeds 2½ or      3. In the month of October, the first and severest
breakage being over, the newly-bottled wine is definitively stacked in
the cellars in piles from two to half-a-dozen bottles deep, from six to
seven feet high, and frequently a hundred feet or upwards in length.
Usually the bottles remain in their horizontal position for about
eighteen or twenty months, though some firms, who pride themselves upon
shipping perfectly matured wines, leave them thus for double this space
of time. All this while the temperature to which the wine is exposed is,
as far as practicable, carefully regulated; for the risk of breakage,
though greatly diminished, is never entirely at an end.





By this time the fermentation is over, but in the interval,
commencing from a few days after the bottling of the wine, a      loose
dark-brown sediment has been forming which has now settled on the lower
55

side of the bottle, and to get rid of which is a delicate and tedious
task. The bottles are placed sur pointe, as it is
termed       that is to say, slantingly in racks with their necks
downwards, the inclination being increased from time to time to one more
abrupt. The object of this change in their position is to cause the
sediment to leave the side of the bottle where it has gathered; it
afterwards becomes necessary to twist and turn it, and coagulate it, as
it were, until it forms a kind of muddy ball, and eventually to get it
well down into the neck of the bottle, so that it may be finally
expelled with a bang when the temporary cork is removed and the proper
one adjusted. To accomplish this the bottles are sharply turned in one
direction every day for at least a month or six weeks, the time being
indefinitely extended until the sediment shows a disposition to settle
near the cork. The younger the wine the longer the period necessary for
the bottles to be shaken, new wine often requiring as much as three
months. Only a thoroughly practised hand can give the right amount of
revolution and the requisite degree of slope; and in some of the cellars
that we visited men were pointed out to us who had acquired such
dexterity as to be able at a pinch to shake with their two hands as many
as 50,000 bottles in a single day.

Some of these men have spent thirty or forty years of their lives
engaged in this perpetual task. Fancy being entombed all alone day after
day in vaults which are invariably dark and gloomy, and often cold and
dank, and being obliged to twist sixty to seventy of these bottles every
minute throughout the day of twelve hours. Why the treadmill and the
crank with their periodical respites must be pastime compared to this
maddeningly monotonous occupation, which combines hard labour, with the
wrist at any rate, with next to solitary confinement. One can understand
these men becoming gloomy and taciturn, and affirming that they
sometimes see devils hovering over the bottle-racks and frantically
shaking the bottles beside them, or else grinning at them as they pursue
their humdrum task. Still it may be taken for granted that the men who
reach
56

this stage are accustomed to drink freely of raw spirits, and merely pay
the penalty resulting from over-indulgence.





In former times the bottles used to be placed with their heads
downwards on tables pierced with holes, from which they had to be
removed and agitated. In 1818, however, a      man named Muller, in the
employment of Madame Clicquot, suggested that the bottles should remain
in the tables whilst being shaken, and further that the holes should be
cut obliquely so that the bottles might recline at varying angles. His
suggestions were privately adopted by Madame Clicquot, but eventually
the improved plan got wind, and the system now prevails throughout the
Champagne. When the bottles have gone through their regular course of
shaking they are examined before a lighted candle to ascertain whether
the deposit has fallen and the wine become perfectly clear. Sometimes it
happens that, twist these men never so wisely, the deposit refuses to
stir, and takes the shape of a bunch of thread technically called a
“claw,” or an adherent mass styled a “mask.” When this is the case an
57

attempt is made to start it by tapping the part to which it adheres with
a piece of iron, the result being frequently the sudden explosion of the
bottle. As a precaution, therefore, the workman protects his face with a
wire-mask or gigantic wire spectacles, which give to him a ghoul-like
aspect.





The cellars of the champagne manufacturers are very varied in
character. The wine that has been grown on the chalky hills undergoes
development in vaults burrowed out of the calcareous strata underlying
the entire district. In excavating these cellars the sides and roofs are
frequently worked smooth and regular as finished masonry. The larger
ones are composed of a number of spacious and lofty galleries, sometimes
parallel with
58

each other, but often ramifying in various directions, and evidently
constructed on no definite plan. They are of one, two, and, in rare
instances, of three stories, and now and then consist of a series of
parallel galleries communicating with each other, lined with masonry,
and with their stone walls and vaulted roofs resembling the crypt of
some conventual building. Others of ancient date are less regular in
their form, being merely so many narrow low winding corridors, varied,
perhaps, by recesses hewn roughly out of the chalk, and resembling the
brigands’ cave of the melodrama, while a certain number of the larger
cellars at Reims are simply abandoned quarries, the broad and lofty
arches of which are suggestive of the nave and aisles of some Gothic
church. In these varied vaults, lighted by solitary lamps in front of
metal reflectors, or by the flickering tallow candles which we carry in
our hands, we pass rows of casks filled with last year’s vintage or
reserved wine of former years, and piles after piles of bottles of
vin brut in seemingly endless sequence       squares, so to
speak, of raw champagne recruits awaiting their turn to be thoroughly
drilled and disciplined. These are varied by bottles reposing necks
downwards in racks at different degrees of inclination according to the
progress their education has attained. Reports caused by exploding
bottles now and then assail the ear, and as the echo dies away it
becomes mingled with the rush of the escaping wine, cascading down the
pile and finding its way across the sloping sides of the floor to the
narrow gutter in the centre. The dampness of the floor and the shattered
fragments of glass strewn about show the frequency of this kind of
accident. The spilt wine, which flows along the gutter into reservoirs,
is usually thrown away, though there is a story current to the effect
that the head of one Epernay firm cooks nearly everything consumed in
his house in the fluid thus let loose in his cellars.

In these subterranean galleries we frequently come upon parties of
workmen engaged in transforming the perfected vin brut into
champagne. Viewed at a distance while occupied in their monotonous task,
they present in the semi-obscurity a series of picturesque
Rembrandt-like studies. One of the end
59

figures in each group is engaged in the important process of
dégorgement, which is performed when the deposit, of which we
have already spoken, has satisfactorily settled in the neck of the
bottle. Baskets full of bottles with their necks downwards are placed
beside the operator, who stands before an apparatus resembling a cask
divided vertically down the middle. This nimble-figured manipulator
seizes a bottle, holds it for a moment before the light to test the
clearness of the wine and the subsidence of the deposit; brings it,
still neck downwards, over a small tub at the bottom of the apparatus
already mentioned; and with a jerk of the steel hook which he holds in
his right hand loosens the agrafe securing the <ins class =
"mycorr" title = "comma in original: possibly intentional">cork,
Bang goes the latter, and with it flies out the sediment and a
small glassful or so of wine, further flow being checked by the
workman’s finger, which also serves to remove any sediment yet remaining
in the bottle’s neck. Like many other clever tricks, this looks very
easy when adroitly performed, though a novice would probably empty the
bottle by the time he had discovered that the cork was out. Occasionally
a bottle bursts in the dégorgeur’s hand, and his face is
sometimes scarred from such explosions. The sediment removed, he slips a
temporary cork into the bottle, and the wine is ready for the important
operation of the dosage, upon the nature and amount of which the
character of the perfected wine, whether it be dry or sweet, light or
strong, very much depends.

Different manufacturers have different recipes, more or less complex
in character, and varying with the quality of the wine and the country
for which it is intended; but the genuine liqueur consists of nothing
but old wine of the best quality, to which a certain amount of
sugar-candy and perhaps a dash of the finest cognac spirit has been
added. The saccharine addition varies according to the market for which
the wine is destined: thus the high-class English buyer demands a dry
champagne, the Russian a wine sweet and strong as “ladies’ grog,” and
the Frenchman and German a sweet light wine. To the extra-dry champagnes
a modicum dose is added, while the so-called “brut” wines receive
no more than from one to three per cent. of liqueur<ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text has comma">.

60

In some establishments the dose is administered with a tin can or ladle;
but more generally an ingenious machine of pure silver and glass which
regulates the percentage of liqueur to a nicety is employed. The
dosage accomplished, the bottle passes to another workman known
as the égaliseur, who fills it up with pure wine. Should a pink
champagne be required, the wine thus added will be red, although
manufacturers of questionable reputation sometimes employ the solution
known as teinte de Fismes. The égaliseur in turn hands the
bottle to the corker, who places it under a machine furnished with a
pair of claws, which compress the cork to a size sufficiently small to
allow it to enter the neck of the bottle, and a suspended weight, which
in falling drives it home. These corks, which are principally obtained
from Catalonia and Andalucia, cost more than twopence each, and are
delivered in huge sacks resembling hop-pockets. Before they are used
they have been either boiled in wine, soaked in a solution of tartar, or
else steamed by the cork merchants, both to prevent their imparting a
bad flavour to the wine and to hinder any leakage. They are commonly
handed warm to the corker, who dips them into a small vessel of wine
before making use of them. Some firms, however, prepare their corks by
subjecting them to cold water douches a day or two beforehand.
The ficeleur receives the bottle from the corker, and with a
twist of the fingers secures the cork with string, at the same time
rounding its hitherto flat top. The metteur de fil next affixes
the wire with like celerity; and then the final operation is performed
by a workman seizing a couple of bottles by the neck and whirling them
round his head, as though engaged in the Indian-club exercise, in order
to secure a perfect amalgamation of the wine and the liqueur.





The final manipulation accomplished, the agitated course of existence
through which the wine has been passing of late comes to an end, and the
bottles are conveyed to another part of the establishment, where they
repose for several days, or even weeks, in order that the mutual action
of the wine and the liqueur upon each other may be complete. When the
time arrives for despatching
61

them they are confided to feminine hands to have their dainty toilettes
made, and are tastefully labelled and either capsuled, or else have
their corks and necks imbedded in sealing-wax, or swathed in gold or
silver foil, whereby they are rendered presentable at the best-appointed
tables.

Thus completed champagne sets out on its beneficial pilgrimage to
promote the spread of mirth and lightheartedness, to drive away dull
care and foment good-fellowship, to comfort the sick and cheer the
sound. Wherever civilisation penetrates, champagne sooner or later is
sure to follow; and if Queen Victoria’s morning drum beats round the
world, its beat is certain to be echoed before the day is over by the
popping of champagne-corks. Now-a-days the exhilarating wine graces not
merely princely but middle-class dinner-tables, and is the needful
adjunct at every petit souper in all the gayer capitals of the
world. It gives a flush to beauty at garden-parties and picnics,
sustains the energies of the votaries of Terpsichore until the hour of
dawn, and imparts to many a young gallant the necessary courage to
declare his passion. It enlivens the dullest of réunions, brings
smiles to the lips of the sternest cynics, softens the most irascible
tempers, and loosens the most taciturn tongues.
62

The grim Berliner and the gay Viennese both acknowledge its enlivening
influence. It sparkles in crystal goblets in the great capital of the
North, and the Moslem wipes its creamy foam from his beard beneath the
very shadow of the mosque of St. Sophia; for the Prophet has only
forbidden the use of wine, and of a surety       Allah be
praised!       this strangely-sparkling delicious liquor, which gives to
the true believer a foretaste of the joys of Paradise, cannot be wine.



At the diamond-fields of South Africa and the diggings of Australia the
brawny miner who has hit upon a big bit of crystallised carbon, or a
nugget of virgin ore, strolls to the “saloon” and shouts for champagne.
The mild Hindoo imbibes it quietly, but approvingly, as he watches the
evolutions of the Nautch girls, and his partiality for it has already
enriched the Anglo-Bengalee vocabulary and London slang with the word
“simkin.” It is transported on camel-backs across the deserts of Central
Asia, and in frail canoes up the mighty Amazon. The two-sworded Daimio
calls for it in the tea-gardens of Yokohama, and the New Yorker, when
not rinsing his stomach by libations of iced-water, imbibes it freely at
Delmonico’s. Wherever civilised man has set his foot       at the base
of the Pyramids and at the summit of the Cordilleras, in the mangrove
swamps of Ashantee and the gulches of the Great Lone Land, in the wilds
of the Amoor and on the desert isles of the Pacific       he has left
traces of his presence in the shape of the empty bottles that were once
full of the sparkling vintage of the Champagne.

The
cellars of the great champagne manufacturers of Reims are scattered in
all directions over the historical old city. They undermine its
narrowest and most insignificant streets, its broad and handsome
boulevards, and on the eastern side extend to its more distant
outskirts. Messrs. Werlé and Co., the successors of the famous Veuve
Clicquot-Ponsardin, have their offices and cellars on the site of a
former Commanderie of the Templars in an ancient quarter of the city,
and strangers passing by the spot would scarcely imagine that under
their feet hundreds of busy hands are incessantly at work, disgorging,
dosing, shaking, corking, storing, wiring, labelling, capsuling, waxing,
tinfoiling,
64

and packing hundreds of thousands of bottles of champagne destined for
all parts of the civilised world.

The house of Clicquot, established in the year 1798 by the husband of
La Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin, who died in 1866, in her 89th year, was
indebted for much of the celebrity of its wine to the lucky accident of
the Russians occupying Reims in 1814 and 1815, and freely requisitioning
the sweet champagne stored in the widow’s capacious cellars. Madame
Clicquot’s wines were slightly known in Russia prior to this date, but
the officers of the invading army, on their return home, proclaimed
their merits throughout the length and breadth of the Muscovite Empire,
and the fortune of the house was made. Madame Clicquot, as every one
knows, amassed enormous wealth, and succeeded in marrying both her
daughter and granddaughter to counts of the ancien régime.








MADAME VEUVE CLICQUOT AT EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE.
(From the Painting by Léon Coignet.) (p. 64)

The present head of the firm is M. Werlé, who comes of an old
Lorraine family although born in the ancient free imperial town of
Wetzlar on the Lahn, where Goethe lays the scene of his “Sorrows of
Werther,” the leading incidents of which really occurred here.
M.      Werlé entered the establishment, which he has done so much to
raise to its existing position, so far back as the year 1821. His care
and skill, exercised over more than half a century, have largely
contributed to obtain for the Clicquot brand that high repute which it
enjoys to-day all over the world. M.      Werlé, who has long been
naturalised in France, was for many years Mayor of Reims and President
of its Chamber of Commerce, as well as one of the deputies of the Marne
to the Corps Législatif. He enjoys the reputation of being the richest
man in Reims, and, like his late partner, Madame Clicquot, he has also
succeeded in securing brilliant alliances for his children, his son,
M.      Alfred Werlé, having married the daughter of the Duc de
Montebello, while his daughter espoused the son of M.      Magne,
Minister of Finance under the Second Empire.








THE CLICQUOT-WERLÉ ESTABLISHMENT AT REIMS. (p. 65)

Half-way down the narrow tortuous Rue du Temple is an ancient
gateway, on which may be traced the half-effaced sculptured heads of
Phœbus and Bacchus. Immediately in front is a
65

green porte-cochère forming the entrance to the Clicquot-Werlé
establishment, and conducting to a spacious trim-kept courtyard, set off
with a few trees, with some extensive stabling and cart-sheds on the
left, and on the right hand the entrance to the cellars. Facing us is an
unpretending-looking edifice, where the
66

firm has its counting-houses, with a little corner tower surmounted by a
characteristic weathercock consisting of a figure of Bacchus seated
astride a cask beneath a vine-branch, and holding up a bottle in one
hand and a goblet in the other. The old Remish Commanderie of the
Knights Templars existed until the epoch of the Great Revolution, and
to-day a few fragments of the ancient buildings remain adjacent to the
“celliers” of the establishment, which are reached through a pair of
folding-doors and down a flight of stone steps, and whence, after being
furnished with lighted candles, we set out on our tour of inspection,
entering first of all the vast cellar of St. Paul, where the thousands
of bottles requiring to be daily shaken are reposing necks downwards on
the large perforated tables which crowd the apartment. It is a
peculiarity of the Clicquot-Werlé establishment that each of the
cellars       forty-five in number, and the smallest a vast
apartment       has its special name. In the adjoining cellar of St.
Matthew other bottles are similarly arranged, and here wine in cask is
likewise stored. We pass rows of huge tuns, each holding its twelve or
thirteen hundred gallons of fine reserved wine designed for blending
with more youthful growths; next are threading our way between seemingly
endless piles of hogsheads filled with later vintages, and anon are
passing smaller casks containing the syrup with which the vin
préparé is dosed. At intervals we come upon some square opening in
the floor through which bottles of wine are being hauled up from the
cellars beneath in readiness to receive their requisite adornment before
being packed in baskets or cases according to the country to which they
are destined to be despatched. To Russia the Clicquot champagne is sent
in cases containing sixty bottles, while the cases for China contain as
many as double that number.






REMAINS OF THE COMMANDERIE AT REIMS.

The ample cellarage which the house possesses has enabled
M.      Werlé to make many experiments which firms with less space at
their command would find it difficult to carry out on the same
satisfactory scale. Such, for instance, is the system of racks in which
the bottles repose while the wine undergoes its diurnal
67

shaking. Instead of these racks being, as they commonly are, at almost
upright angles, they are perfectly horizontal, which, in M.      Werlé’s
opinion, offers a material advantage, inasmuch as the bottles are all in
readiness for disgorging at the same time instead of the lower ones
being ready before those above, as is the case when the ancient system
is followed, owing to the uppermost bottles getting less shaken than the
others.

After performing the round of the celliers we descend into the
caves, a      complete labyrinth of gloomy underground corridors
excavated in the bed of chalk which underlies the city, and roofed and
walled with solid masonry, more or less blackened by age. In one of
these cellars we catch sight of rows of work-people engaged in the
operation of dosing, corking, securing, and shaking the bottles of wine
which have just left the hands of the dégorgeur by the dim light
of half-a-dozen tallow candles. The latest invention for liqueuring the
wine is being employed. Formerly, to prevent the carbonic acid gas
escaping from the bottles while the process of liqueuring was going on,
it was necessary to press a gutta-percha ball connected with the
machine, in order to force the escaping gas back. The new machine,
however, renders this unnecessary, the gas by its own power and
composition forcing itself back into the wine.

In the adjoining cellar of St. Charles are stacks of bottles awaiting
the manipulation of the dégorgeur, while in that of St. Ferdinand
men are engaged in examining other bottles before lighted candles to
make certain that the sediment is thoroughly dislodged and the wine
perfectly clear before the disgorgement is effected. Here, too, the
corking, wiring, and stringing of the newly-disgorged wine are going on.
Another flight of steps leads to the second tier of cellars, where the
moisture trickles down the dank dingy walls, and save the dim light
thrown out by the candles we carried, and by some other far-off
flickering taper stuck in a cleft stick to direct the workmen, who with
dexterous turns of their wrists give a twist to the bottles, all is
darkness. On every side bottles are reposing in various attitudes, the
majority in huge square piles on their sides, others in racks
68

slightly tilted, others, again, almost standing on their heads, while
some, which through over-inflation have come to grief, litter the floor
and crunch beneath our feet. Tablets are hung against each stack of wine
indicating its age, and from time to time a bottle is held up before the
light to show us how the sediment commences to form, or explain how it
eventually works its way down the neck of the bottle, and finally
settles on the cork. Suddenly we are startled by a loud report
resembling a pistol-shot, which reverberates through the vaulted
chamber, as a bottle close at hand explodes, dashing out its heavy
bottom as neatly as though it had been cut by a diamond, and dislocating
the necks and pounding in the sides of its immediate neighbours. The
wine trickles down, and eventually finds its way along the sloping sides
of the slippery floor to the narrow gutter in the centre.

Ventilating shafts pass from one tier of cellars to the other,
enabling the temperature in a certain measure to be regulated, and
thereby obviate an excess of breakage. M.      Werlé estimates that the
loss in this respect during the first eighteen months of a cuvée
amounts to 7      per cent., but subsequently is considerably less. In
1862 one champagne manufacturer lost as much as 45 per cent. of his wine
by breakages. The Clicquot cuvée is made in the cave of St.
William, where 120 hogsheads of wine are hauled up by means of a crane
and discharged into the vat daily as long as the operation lasts. The
tirage or bottling of the wine ordinarily commences in the middle
of May, and occupies fully a month.









RENAISSANCE HOUSE AT REIMS, IN WHICH MADAME CLICQUOT RESIDED.
(p.      69)

M. Werlé’s private residence is close to the establishment in the Rue
du Temple, and here he has collected a small gallery of high-class
modern paintings by French and other artists, including Meissonnier’s
“Card-players,” Delaroche’s “Beatrice Cenci on her way to Execution,”
Fleury’s “Charles      V. picking up the brush of Titian,” various works
by the brothers Scheffer, Knaus’s highly-characteristic genre
picture, “His Highness on a Journey,” and several fine portraits, among
which is one of Madame Clicquot, painted by Léon Coignet, when she was
69

eighty years of age, and another of M.      Werlé by the same artist,
regarded as a chef-d’œuvre. Before her father’s death Madame
Clicquot used to reside in the Rue de Marc, some short distance from the
cellars in which her whole existence centered, in a handsome Renaissance
house, said to have had some connection with the row of palaces that at
one time lined the neighbouring and then fashionable Rue du Tambour.
This, however, is extremely doubtful. A      number of interesting and
well-preserved bas-reliefs decorate one of the façades of the house
looking on to the court. The figures are of the period of François
Premier and his son Henri      II., who inaugurated his reign with a
comforting edict for the Protestants, ordaining that blasphemers were to
have their tongues pierced with red-hot irons, and heretics to be burnt
alive, and who had the ill-luck to lose his eye and life through a
lance-thrust of the Comte de Montgomerie, captain of his Scotch guards,
whilst jousting with him at a tournament held in honour of the marriage
of his daughter Isabelle with the gloomy widower of Queen Mary of
England, of sanguinary fame.





The first of these bas-reliefs represents two soldiers of the Swiss
guard, the next a Turk and a Slav tilting at each other, and then comes
a scroll entwined round a thistle, and inscribed with this enigmatical
motto: “Giane le sur ou rien.” In the third bas-relief a couple of
passionate Italians are winding up a
70

gambling dispute with a hand-to-hand combat, in the course of which
table, cards, and dice have got cantered over; the fourth presenting us
with two French knights, armed cap-à-pie, engaged in a tourney;
while in the fifth and last a couple of German lansquenets essay their
gladiatorial skill with their long and dangerous weapons. Several years
back a tablet was discovered in one of the cellars of the house,
inscribed “Ci-gist vénérable religieux maîstre Pierre Derclé, docteur en
théologie, jadis prieur de céans. Priez Dieu pour luy. 1486,” which
would almost indicate that the house had originally a religious
character, although the warlike spirit of the bas-reliefs decorating it
renders any such supposition with regard to the existing building
untenable.

The Messrs. Werlé own numerous acres of vineyards, comprising the
very finest situations in the well-known districts of Verzenay, Bouzy,
Le Mesnil, and Oger, at all of which places they have vendangeoirs or
pressing-houses of their own. Their establishment at Verzenay contains
seven presses, that at Bouzy eight, at Le Mesnil six, and at Oger two,
in addition to which grapes are pressed under their own supervision at
Ay, Avize, and Cramant in vendangeoirs belonging to their friends.

Since the death of Madame Clicquot the legal style of the firm has
been Werlé and Co., successors to Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin, the mark, of
which M.      Werlé and his son are the sole proprietors, still
remaining “Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin,” while the corks of the bottles are
branded with the words “V.      Clicquot-P.      Werlé,” encircling the
figure of a comet. The style of the wine       light, delicate, elegant,
and fragrant       is familiar to all connoisseurs of champagne. What,
however, is not equally well known is that within the last few years the
firm, in obedience to the prevailing taste, have introduced a perfectly
dry wine of corresponding quality to the richer wine which made the
fortune of the house.

The house of M. Louis Roederer, founded by a plodding German named
Schreider, pursued the sleepy tenor of its way for years, until all at
once it felt prompted to lay siege to the
71

Muscovite connection of La Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin and secure a market
for its wine at Moscow and St. Petersburg. It next opened up the United
States, and finally introduced its brand into England. The house
possesses cellars in various parts of Reims, and has its offices in one
of the oldest quarters of the city       namely, the Rue des Élus, or
ancient Rue des Juifs, records of which date as far back as 1103. These
offices are at the farther end of a courtyard beyond which is a second
court, where carts being laden with cases of champagne seemed to
indicate that some portion of the shipping business of the house is here
carried on. M.      Louis Roederer refused our request for permission to
visit his establishments, so that it is only of their external
appearance that we are able to speak. One of them       the façade of
which is rather imposing, and which has a carved head of Bacchus
surmounting the porte-cochère       is situated in the Boulevard
du Temple, while the principal establishment, a      picturesque range
of buildings of considerable extent, is in the neighbouring Rue de la
Justice.

The old-established firm of Heidsieck and Co., which has secured a
reputation in both hemispheres for its famous Monopole and Dry Monopole
brands, has its cellars scattered about Reims, the central ones, where
the wine is prepared and packed, being situated in the narrow winding
Rue Sedan, at no great distance from the Clicquot-Werlé establishment.
The original firm dates back to 1785, when France was struggling with
those financial difficulties that a few years later culminated in that
great social upheaving which kept Europe in a state of turmoil for more
than a quarter of a century. Among the archives of the firm is a patent,
bearing the signature of the Minister of the Prussian Royal Household,
appointing Heidsieck and Co. purveyors of champagne to Friedrich William
III. The champagne-drinking Hohenzollern par excellence, however,
was the son and successor of the preceding, who, from habitual
over-indulgence in the exhilarating sparkling beverage during the last
few years of his reign, acquired the sobriquet of King
Clicquot.

On passing through the large porte-cochère giving entrance to
72

Messrs. Heidsieck’s principal establishment, one finds oneself in a
small courtyard with the surrounding buildings overgrown with ivy and
venerable vines. On the left is a dwelling-house enriched with elaborate
mouldings and cornices, and at the farther end of the court is the
entrance to the cellars, surmounted by a sun-dial bearing the date 1829.
The latter, however, is no criterion of the age of the buildings
themselves, as these were occupied by the firm at its foundation,
towards the close of the last century. We are first conducted into an
antiquated-looking low cellier, the roof of which is sustained with rude
timber supports, and here bottles of wine are being labelled and packed,
although this is but a mere adjunct to the adjacent spacious
packing-room provided with its loading platform and communicating
directly with the public road. At the time of our visit this hall was
gaily decorated with flags and inscriptions, the day before having been
the fête of St. Jean, when the firm entertain the people in their employ
with a banquet and a ball, at which the choicest wine of the house
liberally flows. From the packing-room we descend into the cellars,
which, like all the more ancient vaults in Reims, have been constructed
on no regular plan. Here we thread our way between piles after piles of
bottles, many of which having passed through the hands of the disgorger
are awaiting their customary adornment. The lower tier of cellars is
mostly stored with vin sur pointe, and bottles with their necks
downwards are encountered in endless monotony along a score or more of
long galleries. The only variation in our lengthened promenade is when
we come upon some solitary workman engaged in his monotonous task of
shaking his 30,000 or 40,000 bottles per diem.

The disgorging at Messrs. Heidsieck’s takes place, in accordance with
the good old rule, in the cellars underground, where we noticed large
stocks of wine three and five years old, the former in the first stage
of sur-pointe, and the latter awaiting shipment. It is a
speciality of the house to ship only matured wine, which is necessarily
of a higher character than the ordinary youthful growths, for a few
years have a wonderful influence in
73

developing the finer qualities of champagne. At the time of our visit,
in the spring of 1877, when the English market was being glutted with
the crude, full-bodied wine of 1874, Messrs. Heidsieck were continuing
to ship wines of 1870 and 1872, beautifully rounded by keeping and of
fine flavour and great delicacy of perfume, and of which the firm
estimated they had fully a year’s consumption still on hand.

Messrs. Heidsieck and Co. have a handsome modern establishment in the
Rue Coquebert       a      comparatively new quarter of the city where
champagne establishments are the rule       the courtyard of which,
alive with workmen at the time of our visit, is broad and spacious,
while the surrounding buildings are light and airy, and the cellars
lofty, regular, and well ventilated. In a large cellier here, where the
tuns are ranged side by side between the rows of iron columns supporting
the roof, the firm make their cuvée; here too the bottling of
their wine takes place, and considerable stocks of high-class reserve
wines and more youthful growths are stored ready for removal when
required by the central establishment. The bulk of Messrs. Heidsieck’s
reserve wines, however, repose in the outskirts of Reims, near the Porte
Dieu-Lumière, in one of the numerous abandoned chalk quarries, which of
late years the champagne manufacturers have discovered are capable of
being transformed into admirable cellars.

In addition to shipping a rich and a dry variety of the Monopole
brand, of which they are sole proprietors, Messrs. Heidsieck export to
this country a rich and a dry Grand Vin Royal. It is, however, to their
famous Monopole wine, and especially to the dry variety, which must
necessarily comprise the finest growths, that the firm owe their
principal celebrity.

Establishment and Renaissance House       His Cellars in the Cour St.
Jacques and Outside the Porte Dieu-Lumière.


Messrs. G. H. Mumm and Co.
have their chief establishment in the Rue Andrieux, in an open quarter
of the city, facing the garden attached to the premises of
M.      Werlé, and only a short distance from the grand triumphal arch
known as the Gate of Mars, by far the most important Roman remain of
which the
75

Champagne can boast. The head of the firm, Mr. G.      H. Mumm, is the
grandson of the well-known P.      A. Mumm, the large shipper of hocks
and moselles, and is the only surviving partner in the champagne house
of Mumm and Co., established at Reims in 1825, and joined by Mr.
G.      H. Mumm so far back as the year 1838. The firm not only ship
their wine largely to England, but head the list of shipments to the
United States, where their brand is held in high repute, with nearly
half a million bottles, being more than twice the quantity shipped by
M.      Louis Roederer       who comes third on the list in
question       and a fourth of the entire shipments of champagne to the
United States.

The establishment of Messrs. G. H. Mumm and Co., in the Rue Andrieux,
is of comparatively modern construction. A      large
porte-cochère conducts to a spacious courtyard, bordered with
sheds, beneath which huge stacks of new bottles are piled and having a
pleasant garden lying beyond. On the left is a large vaulted cellier,
where the operations of disgorging, liqueuring, and corking the wine are
performed, and which communicates with the vast adjoining packing
department. From this cellier entrance is gained to the cellars beneath,
containing a million bottles of vin brut in various stages of
development. This forms, however, merely a portion of the firm’s stock,
they having another three millions of bottles stored in the cellars of
their establishment in the Rue Coquebert, where a scene of great
animation presented itself at the time of our visit, several scores of
women being engaged in washing bottles for the tirage, which,
although it was early in May, had already commenced. The bottles, filled
with water, and containing a certain quantity of glass beads in lieu of
the customary shot, which frequently leave minute particles of
lead       deleterious alike to health and the flavour of the
wine       adhering to the inside surface of the glass, are placed
horizontally in a frame, and by means of four turns of a handle are made
to perform sixty-four rapid revolutions. The beads are then transferred
to other bottles, which are subjected in their turn to the same
revolving process.

The cuvée, commonly composed of from two to three thousand
76

casks of wine from various vineyards, with a due proportion of
high-class vintages, is made in a vat holding 4,400 gallons. The
tirage or bottling is effected by means of two large tuns placed
side by side, and holding twelve hogsheads of wine each. Pipes from
these tuns communicate with a couple of small reservoirs, each of them
provided with half-a-dozen self-acting syphon taps, by means of which a
like number of bottles are simultaneously filled. Only one set of these
taps are set running at a time, as while the wine is being drawn off
from one tun the other is being refilled from the casks containing the
cuvée by means of a pump and leathern hose, which empties a cask
in little more than a couple of minutes. Three gangs of eight men each
can fill, cork, and secure with agrafes from 35,000 to 40,000
bottles during the day. The labour is performed partly by men regularly
employed by the house and partly by hands engaged for the purpose, who
work, however, under the constant inspection of overseers appointed by
the firm.








THE TIRAGE OR BOTTLING OF CHAMPAGNE
AT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MESSRS. G.      H.
MUMM       CO. (p.      76.)

At Messrs. G. H. Mumm’s the champagne destined for shipment has the
heads of the corks submerged in a kind of varnish, with the object of
protecting them from the ravages of insects, and preventing the string
and wire from becoming mouldy for several years. In damp weather, when
this varnish takes a long time to dry, after the bottles have been
placed in a rack with their heads downwards to allow of any superfluous
varnish draining from the corks, the latter are subjected to a moderate
heat in a machine pierced with sufficient holes to contain 500 bottles,
and provided with a warming apparatus in the centre. Here the bottles
remain for about twenty minutes.

Messrs. G. H. Mumm and Co. have a capacious vendangeoir at Verzenay,
near the entrance to the village when approaching it from Reims. The
building contains four presses, three of which are worked with large
fly-wheels requiring several men to turn them, while the fourth acts
with a screw applied by means of a long pole. At the vintage 3,600
kilogrammes, or nearly 8,000lbs., of grapes are put under each press,
a      quantity sufficient to yield eight to ten hogsheads of wine of
forty-four
77

gallons each, suitable for sparkling wine, besides three or four
hogsheads of inferior wine given to the workmen to drink. The pressing
commences daily at six in the morning, and lasts until midnight; yet the
firm are often constrained to keep their grapes in the baskets under a
cool shed for a period of two days. This cannot, however, be done when
they are very ripe, as the colouring matter from the skins would become
extracted and give a dark and objectionable tint to the wine.








MESSRS. G. H. MUMM       CO.’S VENDANGEOIR AT VERZENAY. (p. 77)

Messrs. G. H. Mumm and Co. ship four descriptions of
champagne       Carte Blanche, a      pale, delicate, fragrant wine of
great softness and refined flavour; a      perfectly dry variety of the
foregoing, known as their Extra Dry; also an Extra Quality and a First
Quality       both high-class wines, though somewhat lower in price than
the two preceding.

Within a few minutes’ walk of Messrs. G. H. Mumm’s       past the
imposing Gate of Mars, in the midst of lawns, parterres, and
gravel-walks, where coquettish nursemaids and their charges stroll,
accompanied by the proverbial piou-piou       is the principal
establishment of M.      Gustave Gibert, whose house claims to-day half
a century of existence. On this spot formerly stood the feudal castle of
the Archbishops of Reims, demolished nearly three centuries ago. By whom
this stronghold was erected is somewhat uncertain. The local chronicles
state that a château was built at Reims by Suelf, son of Hincmar, in
922, and restored by Archbishop Henri de France two and a half centuries
later. War or other causes, however, seems to have rendered the speedy
rebuilding of this castle necessary, as a new Château des Archevêques
appears to have been erected at Reims by Henri de Braine between 1228
and 1230. The circumstance of the Archbishops of Reims being dukes and
peers as well as primates of the capital of the Champagne accounts for
their preference for a fortified place of residence at this turbulent
epoch.

On the investiture of a new archbishop it was the custom for him to
proceed in great pomp from the château to the church of Saint Remi, with
a large armed guard and a splendid retinue of ecclesiastical, civil, and
military dignitaries escorting him.
78

The pride of the newly-created “duke and peer” having been thus
gratified, the “prelate” had to humble himself, and on the morrow walked
barefooted from the church of St. Remi to the cathedral. After the
religious wars the château was surrendered to Henri IV., and in 1595 the
Remois, anxious to be rid of so formidable a fortress, which, whether
held by king or archbishop, was calculated to enforce a state of passive
obedience galling to their pride, purchased from the king the privilege
to demolish it for the sum of 8,000 crowns. Tradition asserts that the
Remish Bastille was destroyed in a single day, but this is exceedingly
improbable. Its ruins certainly were not cleared away until the close of
the century.








THE CELLIERS AND CELLARS OF M. GUSTAVE GIBERT.
(Near the Porte de Mars, Reims.) (p. 78.)

When the old fortress was razed to the ground its extensive vaults
were not interfered with, but many long years afterwards were
transformed into admirable cellars for the storage of champagne. Above
them are two stories of capacious celliers where the wine is blended,
bottled, and packed, the vaults themselves comprising two tiers of
cellars which contain wine both in cask and bottle. M.      Gibert’s
remaining stocks are stored in the ancient vaults of the abbey of St.
Peter, in the heart of the city, and in the roomy cellars which underlie
the old Hôtel des Fermes in the Place Royale, where in the days of the
ancien régime the farmers-general of the province used to receive
its revenues. On the pediment of this edifice is a bas-relief with
Mercury, the god of commerce, seated beside a nymph and surrounded by
children engaged with the vintage and with bales of wool, and evidently
intended to symbolise the staple trades of the capital of the Champagne.
A      bronze statue rises in the centre of the Place which from its
Roman costume and martial bearing might be taken for some hero of
antiquity did not the inscription on the pedestal apprise us that it is
intended for the “wise, virtuous, and magnanimous Louis XV.,”
a      misuse of terms which has caused a transatlantic Republican to
characterise the monument as a brazen lie. Leading out of the Place
Royale is the Rue de Cérès, in which there is a modernised 16th-century
house claiming to be the birthplace of Jean
79

Baptiste Colbert, son of a Reims wool-merchant, and the famous minister
who did so much to consolidate the finances which the royal voluptuary,
masquerading at Reims in Roman garb, afterwards made such dreadful
havoc      of.








THE PLACE ROYALE AT REIMS,
SHOWING THE ENTRANCE TO THE CELLARS OF
M.      GUSTAVE GIBERT. (p.      79)

M. Gustave Gibert possesses pressing-houses at Ay and Bouzy, and has
moreover at both these places accommodation for large reserve stocks of
wine in wood. As all the wines which he sends into the market are
vintaged by himself, he can ensure their being of uniform high quality.
His Vin du Roi is notable for perfume, delicacy, perfect
effervescence, and that fine flavour of the grape which characterises
the grand wines of the Champagne. It is a great favourite with the King
of Sweden and Norway, and the labels on the bottles bear his name and
arms. M.      Gibert’s brand has acquired a high reputation in the North
of Europe, and having of late years been introduced into England, is
rapidly making its way there. The merits of the wines have been again
and again publicly recognised, no less than ten medals having been
successively awarded M.      Gibert at the Exhibitions of Toulouse in
1858, Bordeaux in 1859, Besançon in 1860, Metz and Nantes in 1861,
London in 1862, Bayonne and Linz in 1864, and Oporto and Dublin in 1865.
This long list of awards has led to the wines being placed “hors
concours,” nevertheless M.      Gibert continues to submit them to
competition whenever any Exhibition of importance takes place. The wines
are shipped to England, Germany, Russia, and Northern Europe, Spain and
Portugal, Calcutta, Java, Melbourne, and Hong-Kong, besides being
largely in request for the Paris market.

On quitting M. Gibert’s central establishment we proceed along the
winding, ill-paved Rue de Mars, past the premises of Messrs. Jules Mumm
and Co., an offshoot from the once famous firm of P.      A. Mumm and
Co., to the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville, in one corner of which stands a
massive and somewhat pretentious-looking house, dating back to the time
of Louis Quatorze. Here are the offices of Ruinart père et fils, who
claim to rank as the oldest existing house in the Champagne. The head of
the firm, the Vicomte de Brimont, is a collateral descendant
80

of the Dom Ruinart, whose remains repose nigh to those of the
illustrious Dom Perignon in the abbey church of Hautvillers. From the
Place de l’Hôtel de Ville we proceed through the narrow Rue du Tambour,
originally a Roman thoroughfare, and during the Middle Ages the locality
where the nobility of Reims principally had their abodes. Half-way up
this street, in the direction of the Place des Marchés, stands the
famous House of the Musicians, one of the most interesting architectural
relics of which the capital of the Champagne can boast. It evidently
dates from the early part of the fourteenth century, but by whom it was
erected is unknown. Some ascribe it to the Knights Templars, others to
the Counts of Champagne, while others suppose it to have been the
residence of the famous Counts de la Marck, who in later times diverged
into three separate branches, the first furnishing Dukes of Cleves and
Julich to Germany and Dukes of Nevers and Counts of Eu to France, while
the second became Dukes of Bouillon and Princes of Sedan, titles which
passed to the Turennes when Henri de la Tour d’Auvergne, Vicomte de
Turenne, married the surviving heiress of the house. The third branch
comprised the Barons of Lumain, allied to the Hohenzollerns. Their most
famous member slew Louis de Bourbon, Archbishop of Liège, and flung his
body into the Meuse, and subsequently became celebrated as the Wild Boar
of the Ardennes, of whom all readers of Quentin Durward will
retain a lively recollection.

To return, however, to the House of the Musicians. A probable
conjecture ascribes the origin of the quaint mediæval structure to the
Brotherhood of Minstrels of Reims, who in the thirteenth century enjoyed
a considerable reputation, not merely in the Champagne, but throughout
the North of France. The house takes its present name from five seated
statues of musicians, larger than life-size, occupying the Gothic niches
between the first-floor windows, and resting upon brackets ornamented
with grotesque heads. It is thought that the partially-damaged figure on
the left-hand side was originally playing a drum and a species of
clarionet. The next one evidently has the
81

remnants of a harp in his raised hands. The third or central figure is
supposed merely to have held a hawk upon his wrist; whilst the fourth
seeks to extract harmony from a dilapidated bagpipe; and the fifth, with
crossed legs, strums complacently away upon the fiddle. The ground floor
of the quaint old tenement is to-day an oil and colour shop, the front
of which is covered with chequers in all the tints of the rainbow.





Leading from the Rue du Tambour is the Rue de la Belle Image, thus
named from a handsome statuette of the Virgin which formerly decorated a
corner niche; and beyond is the Rue St. Hilaire, where Messrs. Barnett
et fils, trading under the
82

designation of Périnet et fils, and the only English house engaged in
the manufacture of champagne, have an establishment which is certainly
as perfect as any to be found in Reims. Aboveground are several large
store-rooms, where vintage casks and the various utensils common to a
champagne establishment are kept, and a capacious cellier, upwards of
150 feet in length, with its roof resting on huge timber supports. Here
new wine is stored preparatory to being blended and bottled, and in the
huge tun, holding nearly 3,000 gallons, standing at the further end, the
firm make their cuvée, while adjacent is a room where stocks of
corks and labels, metal foil, and the like are kept.

There are three stories of cellars       an exceedingly rare thing
anywhere in the Champagne       all constructed in solid masonry on a
uniform plan       namely, two wide galleries running parallel with each
other and connected by means of transverse passages. Spite of the great
depth to which these cellars descend they are perfectly dry; the
ventilation, too, is excellent, and their different temperatures render
them especially suitable for the storage of champagne, the temperature
of the lowest cellar being 6° Centigrade (43° Fahrenheit), or one degree
Centigrade below the cellar immediately above, which, in its turn is two
degrees below the uppermost one of all. The advantage of this is that
when the wine develops an excess of effervescence any undue proportion
of breakages can be checked by removing the bottles to a lower cellar
and consequently into a lower temperature.









THE CELLIER AND CELLARS OF PÉRINET ET FILS AT REIMS. (p. 82)

The first cellars we enter are closely stacked with wine in bottle,
which is gradually clearing itself by the formation of a deposit, while
in an adjoining cellar on the same level the operations of disgorging,
liqueuring, and corking are going on. In the cellars immediately beneath
bottles of wine repose in solid stacks ready for the dégorgeur,
while others rest in racks in order that they may undergo their daily
shaking. In the lowest cellars reserved wine in cask is stored, as it
best retains its natural freshness and purity in a very cool place. All
air is carefully excluded from the casks, any ullage is immediately
checked, and as evaporation is continually going on the casks
83

are examined every fortnight, when any deficiency is at once
replenished. At Messrs. Périnet et fils’, as at all the first-class
establishments, the vin brut is a mélange comprising the
produce of some of the best vineyards, and has every possible attention
paid to it during its progressive stages of development.

Champagnes of different years were here shown to us, all of them
soft, light, and delicate, and with that fine flavour and full perfume
which the best growths of the Marne alone exhibit. Among several
curiosities submitted to us was a still Verzenay of the year 1857, one
of the most delicate red wines it was ever our fortune to taste. Light
in body, rich in colour, of a singularly novel and refined flavour, and
with a magnificent yet indefinable bouquet, the wine was in every
respect perfect. Not only was the year of the vintage a grand one, but
the wine must have been made with the greatest possible care and from
the most perfect grapes for so delicate a growth to have retained its
flavour in such perfection, and preserved its brilliant ruby colour for
such a length of time.

From the samples shown to us of Périnet et fils’ champagne, we were
prepared to find that at some recent tastings in London, the particulars
of which have been made public, their Extra Sec took the first place at
each of the three severe competitions to which it was subjected.

M. Duchâtel-Ohaus’s central establishment is in the Rue des Deux
Anges, one of the most ancient streets of Reims, running from the Rue
des Élus to the Rue de Vesle, and having every window secured by iron
gratings, and every door thickly studded with huge nails. These
prison-like façades succeed each other in gloomy monotony along either
side of the way, the portion of M.      Duchâtel-Ohaus’s residence which
faces the street being no exception to the general rule. Once within its
court, however, and quite a different scene presents itself. Before us
is a pleasant little flower-garden with a small but charming Renaissance
house looking on to it, the windows ornamented with elaborate mouldings,
and surmounted by graceful sculptured heads, while at one corner rises a
tower with a sun-dial displayed on its front.
84

Here and in an adjoining house the canons of the Cathedral were
accustomed to reside in the days when four-fifths of Reims belonged to
the Church.



 -->








From the garden we enter a capacious cellier where the blending and
bottling of the wine takes place, and in the neighbouring packing-room
encounter a score of workpeople filling, securing, and branding a number
of cases about to be despatched by rail. From the cellier we pass to the
cellars situated immediately underneath, and which, capacious though
they are, do not suffice for M.      Duchâtel’s stock, portions of which
are stored in some ancient vaults near the market-place, and in the Rue
de Vesle behind the church of St. Jacques. This church, originally built
85

at the close of the twelfth century, is hemmed in on all sides by old
houses, above which rises its tapering steeple surmounted by a medieval
weathercock in the form of an angel. A      life-size statue of the
patron saint decorates the Gothic gateway leading to the church, from
which a troop of Remish urchins in the charge of some Frères de la
Doctrine Chrétienne emerge as we pass      by.

The Cour St. Jacques, where M. Duchâtel’s cellars are situated, may
be reached by passing through the church, the interior of which presents
a curious jumble of architectural styles from early Gothic to late
Renaissance. One noteworthy object of art which it contains is a
life-size crucifix carved by Pierre Jacques, a      Remish sculptor of
the days of the Good King Henri, and from an anatomical point of view a
perfect chef-d’œuvre. The cellars we have come to inspect are two
stories deep, and comprise numerous ancient cavernous compartments, such
as are found in all the older quarters of Reims, and usually in the
vicinity of some church, convent, or clerical abode. It has been
suggested that they were either crypts for sacred retirement and prayer,
dungeons for the punishment of recreant brethren, or tombs for the dead;
but it is far more probable that in the majority of instances they
served then as now simply for the storage of the choice vintages of the
Marne, for we all know the monks of old were tipplers of no ordinary
capacity, who usually contrived to secure the best that the district
provided. These vaults of M.      Duchâtel’s, in which a considerable
stock of the fine wine of 1874 is stored, are from two to three
centuries old, and probably belonged to the curés of St. Jacques. They
are of considerable extent, are well ventilated, and are walled and
roofed with stone. M.      Duchâtel’s remaining stock reposes in some
new cellars       certain transformed chalk quarries outside the Porte
Dieu-Lumière, comprising broad lofty galleries and vast circular
chambers       fifty feet or so in height and well lighted from
above.

At M. Duchâtel-Ohaus’s we tasted a variety of fine samples of his
brand, including a beautiful wine of 1868 and an almost equally good one
of 1870, with some of the excellent vintage of 1874, which was then
being prepared for shipment.

Few
large manufacturing towns like Reims       one of the most important of
those engaged in the woollen manufacture in France       can boast of
such fine promenades and such handsome boulevards as the capital of the
Champagne. As the ancient
87

fortifications of the city were from time to time razed, their site was
levelled and generally planted with trees, so that the older quarters of
Reims are almost encircled by broad and handsome thoroughfares,
separating the city, as it were, from its outlying suburbs. In or close
to the broad Boulevard du Temple, which takes its name from its
proximity to the site of the ancient Commanderie of the Templars,
various champagne manufacturers, including M.      Louis Roederer,
M.      Ernest Irroy, and M.      Charles Heidsieck, have their
establishments, while but a few paces off, in the neighbouring Rue
Coquebert, are the large and handsome premises of Messrs. Krug
and      Co.









M. ERNEST IRROY’S ESTABLISHMENT AT REIMS. (p. 87)

The offices of M. Ernest Irroy, who is known in Reims not merely as a
large champagne grower and shipper, but also as a distinguished amateur
of the fine arts, taking a leading part in originating local exhibitions
and the like, are attached to his private residence, a      handsome
mansion flanked by a large and charming garden in the Boulevard du
Temple. The laying out of this sylvan oasis is due to M.      Vadré, the
head gardener of the city of Paris, who contributed so largely to the
picturesque embellishment of the Bois de Boulogne. M.      Irroy’s
establishment, which comprises a considerable range of buildings grouped
around two courtyards, is immediately adjacent, although its principal
entrance is in the Rue de la Justice. The vast celliers, covering an
area of upwards of 3,000 square yards, and either stocked with wine in
cask or used for packing and similar purposes, afford the requisite
space for carrying on a most extensive business. The cellars beneath
comprise three stories, two of which are solidly roofed and lined with
masonry, while the lowermost one is excavated in the chalk. They are
admirably constructed on a symmetrical plan, and their total surface is
very little short of 7,000 square yards. Spite of the great depth to
which these cellars descend they are perfectly dry, the ventilation is
good, and their temperature moreover is remarkably cool, one result of
which is that M.      Irroy’s loss from breakage never exceeds four per
cent. per annum. M.      Irroy holds a high position as a
vineyard-proprietor in the Champagne, his
88

vines covering an area of nearly 86 acres. At Mareuil and Avenay he owns
some twenty-five acres, at Verzenay and Verzy about fifteen, and at
Ambonnay and Bouzy forty-six acres. His father and his uncle, whose
properties he inherited or purchased, commenced some thirty years ago to
plant vines on certain slopes of Bouzy possessing a southern aspect, and
he has followed their example with such success both at Bouzy and
Ambonnay that in 1873 the Reims Agricultural Association conferred upon
him a silver-gilt medal for his plantations of vines. M.      Irroy owns
vendangeoirs at Verzenay, Avenay, and Ambonnay; and at Bouzy,
where his largest vineyards are, he has built some excellent cottages
for his labourers. He has also constructed a substantial bridge over the
ravine which, formed by winter torrents from the hills, intersects the
principal vineyard slopes of Bouzy.

M. Ernest Irroy’s wines, prepared with scrupulous care and rare
intelligence, have been known in England for some years past, and are
steadily increasing in popularity. They are emphatically connoisseurs’
wines. The best West-end clubs, such as White’s, Arthur’s, the old
Carlton, and the like, lay down the cuvées of this house in good
years as they lay down their vintage ports and finer clarets, and drink
them, not in a crude state, but when they are in perfection       that
is, in five to ten years’ time. M.      Irroy exports to the British
colonies and to the United States the same fine wines which he ships to
England.









LABOURERS AT WORK IN M. ERNEST IRROY’S BOUZY VINEYARDS. (p. 88.)

From M. Irroy’s we proceeded to Messrs. Binet fils and Co., whose
establishment in the Rue de la Justice is separated from that of
M.      Irroy merely by a narrow path, and occupies the opposite side of
the way to the principal establishment of M.      Louis Roederer. The
firm of Binet fils and Co. was founded many years ago, but for a long
time they sold their wines principally to other shippers on the Reims
and Epernay markets, where their cuvées were held in high repute, and
only of recent years have they applied themselves to the shipping trade.
Their establishment has two entrances, one in the Rue de la Justice, and
the other in the Boulevard du Champ de Mars. On passing through
89

the former we find ourselves in a courtyard of considerable area, with a
range of celliers in the rear and a low building on the left, in which
the offices are installed. In the first cellier we encounter cases and
baskets of champagne all ready to be despatched by rail, with women and
men busily engaged in labelling and packing other bottles which continue
to arrive from the cellars below in baskets secured to an endless chain.
Beyond this range of celliers is another courtyard of smaller dimensions
where there are additional celliers in which wines of recent vintages in
casks are stored.

The vaults, which are reached by a winding stone staircase, are
spacious, and consist of a series of parallel and uniform galleries hewn
in the chalk without either masonry supports or facings. Among the solid
piles of bottles which here hem us in on all sides are a considerable
number of magnums and imperial pints reserved for particular
customers       the former more especially for certain military messes,
at which the brand of Binet fils and Co. is held in deserved esteem. We
tasted here       in addition to several choice sparkling wines,
including a grand vin brut, vintage 1865       a      still Ay of
the year 1870, and some still Bouzy of 1874. The former,
a      remarkably light and elegant wine, was already in fine condition
for drinking, while the latter, which was altogether more vinous, deeper
in colour, and fuller in body needed the ripening influence of time to
bring it to perfection. Through their agents, Rutherford, Drury, and
Co., Messrs. Binet fils and Co. achieved a great success in England with
their still Sillery, vintage 1857, and subsequently with their superb
creaming vin brut, vintage 1865, of which we have just spoken,
and which is still to be met with at London clubs of repute.

Some short distance from and parallel with the Rue de la Justice is
the Rue Jacquart, where Messrs. Charles Farre and Co., of whose
establishment at Hautvillers we have already spoken, have their offices
and cellars. We enter a large courtyard, where several railway vans are
being laden with cases of wine from the packing-hall beyond, and in the
tasting-room adjoining find wine being tested prior to bottling, to
ascertain the amount of saccharine
90

it contains. This was accomplished by reducing a certain quantity of
wine by boiling down to one-sixth, when the saccharometer should
indicate 13° of sugar to ensure each bottle containing the requisite
quantity of compressed carbonic acid gas.

Messrs. Farre’s cellars, comprising eighteen parallel galleries
disposed in two stories, are both lofty and commodious, and are mainly
of recent construction, the upper ones being solidly walled with
masonry, while those below are simply excavated in the chalk. Here, as
elsewhere, one performed a lengthened promenade between piles after
piles of bottles of the finer vintages and a seemingly endless
succession of racks, at which workmen were engaged in dislodging the
sediment in the wine by the dim light of a tallow candle. It was here
that we were assured the more experienced of these men were capable,
when working with both hands, of shaking the enormous number of 50,000
bottles a day, or at the rate of seventy to the minute.

The fine wines of Messrs. Charles Farre and Co. have long enjoyed a
well-deserved celebrity, and at the Paris Exhibition of 1855 the firm
secured the highest medal awarded to champagnes. The high repute in
which the brand is held on the Continent is evidenced by the fact that
the Prussian and other courts are consumers of Messrs. Farre’s wines.
The firm not only number England, Germany, Austria, Russia, and Northern
Europe, and, as a matter of course, France, among their customers, but
also several of the British colonies and North and South America as
well.

The new establishment of Messrs. Fisse, Thirion, and Co., in the
erection of which they have largely profited by their experience and the
various resources of modern science, is situated in the Place de
Betheny, in the vicinity of the railway goods station and the local
shooting range, largely resorted to at certain seasons of the year, when
the crack shots of the Champagne capital compete with distinguished
amateurs from different parts of France and the other side of the
Channel.









MESSRS. FISSE, THIRION       CO.’S ESTABLISHMENT AT REIMS.
(p.      91)

On entering the courtyard through the iron gate to the right of the
dwelling-houses of the resident partners       flanked by
91

gardens brilliant with flowers and foliage       we first reach the
offices and tasting-rooms, and then the entrance to the cellars.
A      speciality of this important pile of building is that everything
employed in its construction is of stone, brick, or iron, wood having
been rigorously excluded from it. In the rear of the courtyard, which
presents that aspect of animation common to flourishing establishments
in the Champagne, is the principal cellier, with a small building in
front, where a steam-pump for pumping up water from the chalk is
installed, while at right angles with the cellier are the stables and
bottle-sheds. The large cellier, which is 20 feet high and 80 feet
broad, will be no less than 260 feet in length when completed. It
contains two stories, the floors of both of which are cemented, the
lower story being roofed with small brick arches connected by iron
girders, and the upper one with tiles resting on iron supports. The
cement keeps the temperature remarkably cool in the lower cellier where
wine in cask is stored, the upper cellier being appropriated to wine in
racks sur pointe, bales of corks, and the wicker-baskets and
cases in which the wine is packed.

The preparation of the wines in cask and the bottling take place in
the lower of the two celliers, a      mere lad being enabled, by the aid
of the mechanism provided, to bottle from six to eight thousand bottles
a day. A      single workman can cork about 4,500 bottles, which a
second workman secures with metal agrafes before they are lowered into
the cellars. The latter are of two stories, each being divided into
three long parallel galleries 20 feet high and 23 feet wide, vaulted
with stone and floored with cement. Bordering the endless stacks of
bottles are small gutters, into which the wine flows from the exploded
bottles. Lofty, well ventilated, and beautifully cool, the temperature
invariably ranging from 45° to 47° Fahrenheit, these
capitally-constructed cellars combine all that is required for a
champagne establishment of the first class. The breakage has never
exceeded 3      per cent., whereas in some old cellars which the firm
formerly occupied in the centre of the city, their breakage on one
occasion amounted to ten times this quantity.

92






At Fisse, Thirion, and Co.’s, after the wine has been disgorged and
liqueured, the corks are secured neither with string nor wire, but a
special metal fastener is employed for the purpose. This consists of a
triple-branched agrafe, provided with a kind of hinge. A      tiny toy
needle-gun suspended to the agrafe is pulled outwards and turned over
the top of the bottle, whereupon the fastening becomes instantly
disengaged, and anything like trouble, uncleanliness, or annoyance is
entirely avoided. The operation is so easy that a mere child can open a
bottle of champagne, secured by this patent fastener, as easily and
rapidly as a grown-up man.

The firm of Fisse, Thirion, and Co. succeeded that of Fisse,
Fraiquin, and Co.       established originally at Reims in 1821       in
1864, when the brand of the house was already well known on the
Continent, more especially in Belgium and Holland. Since that time the
wines have been largely introduced into England and the United States,
and the firm, who have secured medals at many of the recent exhibitions,
to-day have agents in the English and Dutch Indies and the various
European settlements in China. Several descriptions of wine are shipped
by the house, the finest being their dry Cuvée Reservèe and their
fragrant soft-tasting Cachet d’Or.

Nigh
the cathedral of Reims and in the rear of the archiepiscopal palace
there runs a short narrow street known as the Rue
94

Vauthier le Noir, and frequently mentioned in old works relating to the
capital of the Champagne. The discovery of various pillars and statues,
together with a handsome Gallo-Roman altar, whilst digging some
foundations in 1837, points to the fact that a Pagan temple formerly
occupied the site. The street is supposed to have taken its name,
however, from some celebrated gaoler, for in mediæval times here stood
“la prison de bonne semaine.” On the site of this prison a château was
subsequently built where Mary Queen of Scots is said to have resided in
the days when her uncle, Cardinal Charles de Lorraine, was Lord
Archbishop of Reims. Temple, prison, and palace have alike disappeared,
and where they stood there now rises midway between court and garden a
handsome mansion, the residence of Madame Pommery, head of the
well-known firm of Pommery and Greno. To the left of the courtyard,
which is entered through a monumental gateway, are some old buildings
bearing the sculptured escutcheon of the beautiful and luckless Stuart
Queen, while to the right are the offices, with the manager’s sanctum,
replete with artistic curiosities, the walls being completely covered
with remarkable specimens of faïence, including Rouen, Gien, Palissy,
Delft, and majolica, collected in the majority of instances by Madame
Pommery in the villages around Reims. Here we were received by
M.      Vasnier, who at once volunteered to accompany us to the cellars
of the firm outside the city. Messrs. Pommery and Greno originally
carried on business in the Rue Vauthier le Noir, where there are
extensive cellars, but their rapidly-increasing connection long since
compelled them to emigrate beyond the walls of Reims.





In close proximity to the Rue Vauthier le Noir is the Rue des
Anglais, so named from the English Catholic refugees who, flying from
the persecutions of our so-called Good Queen Bess, here took up their
abode and established a college and a seminary. They rapidly acquired
great influence in Reims, and one of their number, William Gifford, was
even elected archbishop. At the end of this street, nigh to Madame
Pommery’s, there stands an old house with a corner tower and rather
handsome
95

Renaissance window, which formerly belonged to some of the clergy of the
cathedral, and subsequently became the “Bureau Général de la Loterie de
France,” abolished by the National Convention in 1793.





The Rue des Anglais conducts into the Rue de l’Université, where a
few remnants of the old University, founded by Cardinal Charles de
Lorraine (1538-74), attract attention, notably a conical-capped corner
tower, the sculptured ornaments at the base of which have crumbled into
dust beneath the corroding tooth of Time. From the Rue de l’Université
our way lies along the Boulevard du Temple to the Porte Gerbert, about a
mile beyond which there rises up the curious castellated structure in
which the Pommery establishment is installed, and whose tall towers
command a view of the whole of Reims and its environs. As we drive up
the Avenue Gerbert we espy on the right an isolated crumbling Roman
tower, a      remnant of the days when Reims disputed with Trèves the
honour of being
96

the capital of Belgic Gaul. Close at hand, and almost under the walls of
the old fortifications, is a grotto to which an ancient origin is
likewise ascribed. In another minute we reach the open iron gates of
Messrs. Pommery’s establishment, flanked by a picturesque porter’s
lodge, and proceeding up a broad drive alight under a Gothic portico at
the entrance to the spacious and lofty cellier. Iron columns support the
roof of this vast hall, at one end of which is the office and
tasting-room, provided with a telegraphic apparatus by means of which
communication is carried on with the Reims bureaux. Stacked up on every
side of the cellier, and when empty often in eight tiers, are rows upon
rows of casks, 4,000 of which contain wine of the last vintage,
sufficient for a million bottles of champagne.
97

The temperature of this hall is carefully regulated; the windows are
high up near the roof, the sun’s rays are rigidly excluded, so that a
pleasant coolness pervades the apartment. On the left-hand side stands
the huge tun, capable of containing 5,500 gallons of wine, in which the
firm make their cuvée, with the monogram P and G, surmounting the
arms of Reims, carved on its head. A      platform, access to which is
gained by a staircase in a side aisle, runs round this tonneau; and boys
stand here when the wine is being blended, and by means of a handle
protruding above the cask work the paddle-wheels placed inside, thereby
securing the complete amalgamation of the wine, which has been hoisted
up in casks and poured through a metal trough into the tonneau.
Adjoining are the chains and lifts worked by steam by means of which
wine is raised and lowered from and to the cellars beneath, one lift
raising or lowering eight casks, whether full or empty, in the space of
a minute.









THE POMMERY ESTABLISHMENT, IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF REIMS. (p. 96)

At the farther end of the hall a Gothic door, decorated with
ornamental ironwork, leads to the long broad flight of steps 116 in
number and nearly twelve feet in width, conducting to the suite of lofty
subterranean chambers where bottles of vin brut repose in their
hundreds of thousands in slanting racks or solid
98

piles, passing leisurely through those stages of development necessary
to fit them for the dégorgeur. Altogether there are thirty large
shafts, which were originally quarries, and are now connected by
spacious galleries. This side of Reims abounds with similar quarries,
which are believed to have served as places of refuge for the
Protestants at the time of the League and after the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes, and it is even conjectured that the early Christians,
the followers of St. Sixtus and St. Sinicus, here hid themselves from
their persecutors. Since the cellars within the city have no longer
sufficed for the storage of the immense stocks required through the
development of the champagne trade, these vast subterranean galleries
have been successfully utilised by various firms. Messrs. Pommery, after
pumping out the water with which the chambers were filled, proceeded to
excavate the intersecting tunnels, shore up the cracking arches, and
repair the flaws in the chalk with masonry, finally converting these
abandoned quarries into magnificent cellars for the storage of
champagne. No less than £60,000 was spent upon them and the castellated
structure aboveground. The underground area is almost 240,000 square
feet, and a million bottles of champagne can be stored in these
capacious vaults.











HEAD OVERSEER AT
POMMERY AND GRENO’S.




Madame Pommery made a great mark with her splendid cuvée of
1868, and since this time her brand has become widely popular, the
Pommery Sec especially being highly appreciated by connoisseurs.

On leaving Messrs. Pommery’s we retrace our steps down the Avenue
Gerbert, bordered on either side with rows of plane-trees, until we
reach the treeless Avenue de Sillery, where Messrs. de Saint Marceaux
and Co.’s new and capacious establishment is installed. The principal
block of building is flanked by two advanced wings inclosing a
garden-court, set off with flowers and shrubs, and from the centre of
which rises a circular shaft, covered in with glass, admitting light and
air to the cellars below. In the building to the left the wine is
received on its arrival from the vineyard, and here are ranged hundreds
of casks replete with the choice crûs of Verzenay, Ay, Cramant,
and Bouzy, while
99

some thousands of bottles ready for labelling are stocked in massive
piles at the end of the packing-hall in the corresponding wing of the
establishment. Here, too, a      tribe of workpeople are arraying the
bottles with gold and silver headdresses and robing them in pink paper,
while others are filling, securing, marking, and addressing the cases or
baskets to Hong-Kong, San Francisco, Yokohama, Bombay, London, New York,
St. Petersburg, Berlin, or Paris.









THE PACKING HALL OF MESSRS. DE SAINT-MARCEAUX AT REIMS. (p. 99)

The wine in cask, stored in the left-hand wing, after having been
duly blended in a vast vat holding over 2,400 gallons, is drawn off into
bottles, which are then lowered down a shaft to the second tier of
cellars by means of an endless chain, on to which the baskets of bottles
are swiftly hooked. The workman engaged in this duty, in order to
prevent his falling down the shaft, has a leather belt strapped round
his waist, by means of which he is secured to an adjoining iron column.
We descend into the lower cellars down a flight of ninety-three broad
steps       a      depth equal to the height of an ordinary six-storied
house       and find no less than four-and-twenty galleries excavated in
the chalk, without any masonry supports, and containing upwards of a
million bottles of champagne. The length of these galleries varies, but
they are of a uniform breadth, allowing either a couple of racks with
wine sur pointe, or stacks of bottles, in four rows on either
side, with an ample passage down the centre.

The upper range of cellars comprises two large arched galleries of
considerable breadth, one of which contains wine in wood and wine sur
pointe, while the other is stocked with bottles of wine heads
downward, ready to be delivered into the hands of the
dégorgeur.












BAS-RELIEF NEAR THE
PORTE DIEU-LUMIÈRE.




MM. de St. Marceaux and Co. have the honour of supplying the King of
the Belgians, the President of the French Republic, and several German
potentates, with an exceedingly delicate champagne known as the Royal
St. Marceaux. The same wine is popular in Russia and other parts of
Europe, just as the Dry Royal of the firm is much esteemed in the United
States.
100

The brand of the house most appreciated in this country is its Carte
d’Or, a      very dry wine which, in conjunction with the firm’s Extra
Quality, secured the first place at a recent champagne competition in
England.

In the neighbourhood of the Pommery and de St. Marceaux
establishments numerous other champagne manufacturers have their cellars
formed from the abandoned quarries so numerous on this side of the city.
Of some of these firms we have already spoken, but there remain to be
mentioned Messrs. Kunklemann and Co., Ruinart père et fils, George
Goulet, Jules Champion, Théophile Roederer,      c. The cellars of the
three last-named are immediately outside the Porte Dieu-Lumière, near
which is a house with a curious bas-relief on its face, the subject of
which has been a source of much perplexity to local antiquaries.

Those
magnates of the champagne trade, <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text reads ‘Mesrs.’">Messrs.
Moët and Chandon, whose famous “star”
brand is familiar in every part of the civilised globe, and whose
half-score miles of cellars contain as many million bottles of champagne
as there are millions of inhabitants in most of the secondary European
states, have their head-quarters at Epernay in a spacious
château       in that street of châteaux named the Rue du Commerce, but
commonly known as the Faubourg de la Folie       which is approached
through handsome iron gates, and has beautiful gardens in the rear
extending in the direction of the River Marne. The existing firm dates
from the year 1833, but the family of Moët       conjectured to have
originally come from the Low Countries       had already been associated
with the champagne wine trade for well-nigh a century previously. If the
Moëts came from Holland they must have established themselves in the
Champagne at a very early date, for the annals of Reims record that in
the fifteenth century Jean and Nicolas Moët were échevins of the
city. A      Moët was present in that capacity at the coronation of
Charles VII. in 1429, when Joan of Arc stood erect by the principal
altar of the cathedral with her sacred banner in her hand, and for
having contributed to repulse an attempt on the part of the English to
prevent the entrance of the Royal party into the city, the Moëts were
subsequently ennobled by the same monarch. A      mural tablet in the
church of St. Remi records the death of D.      G. Moët, Grand Prior, in
1554, and nine years later we find Nicol Moët claiming exemption at
Epernay from the payment of tailles on the ground of his being a
noble. An old commercial book preserved in the family archives shows
that in the year 1743       at the epoch when the rashness of the Duc de
Grammont saved the English army under George      II. from being cut to
pieces at Dettingen       a      descendant of the foregoing, one Claude
Louis Nicolas Moët, who owned considerable vineyard
103

property in the vicinity of Epernay, decided upon embarking in the wine
trade. It is his son, however, Jean Remi Moët, born in 1758, who may be
looked upon as the veritable founder of the present commerce in
Champagne wines, which, thanks to his efforts, received a wonderful
impulse, so that instead of the consumption of the vintages of the Marne
being limited as heretofore to the privileged few, it spread all over
the civilised world.

At Messrs. Moët and Chandon’s we had the opportunity of inspecting
some of the old account-books of the firm, and more particularly those
recording the transactions of Jean Remi Moët and his father. The first
sales of sparkling wine, on May 23rd, 1743, comprised 301 bottles of the
vintage of 1741 to Pierre Joly, wine-merchant, bon des douze chez le
Roi, whatever that may mean, at Paris; 120 bottles to Pierre Gabriel
Baudoin, also bon des douze, at Paris; and a similar quantity to
the Sieur Compoin, keeping the “hotellerie ditte la pestitte Escurie,”
Rue du Port Maillart, at Nantes in Brittany. The entry specifies that
the wine for Nantes is to be left at Choisy-le-Roi, and taken by land to
Orleans by the carters of that town, who are to be found at the Ecu
d’Orléans, Porte St. Michel, Paris, the carriage as far as Choisy being
4      livres 10 deniers (about 4      francs) for the two half-baskets,
and to Paris 3      livres 15 deniers the basket.

Between 1750 and ’60, parcels of wine were despatched to Warsaw,
Vienna, Berlin, Königsberg, Dantzig, Stettin, Brussels, and Amsterdam;
but one found no mention of any sales to England till the year 1788,
when the customers of the firm included “Milord” Farnham, of London, and
Messrs. Felix Calvert and Sylvin, who had a couple of sample bottles
sent to them, for which they were charged five shillings. In the same
year Messrs. Carbonnell, Moody, and Walker (predecessors of the
well-known existing firm of Carbonnell and Co.) wrote in French for two
baskets, of ten dozens each, of vin de champagne “of good body,
not too charged with liqueur, but of excellent taste, and not at all
sparkling!” while the Chevalier Colebrook, writing from Bath,
requests that 72 bottles of champagne may
104

be sent to his friend the Hon. John Butler, Molesworth Street, Dublin,
“who if contented with the wine will become a good customer, he being
rich, keeping a good house, and receiving many amateurs of vin de
champagne.” Shortly afterwards the chevalier himself receives 50
bottles of still wine, vintage 1783. In 1789 120 bottles of champagne,
vintage 1788, are supplied to “Milord” Findlater, of London       an
ancestor, no doubt, of the wine-merchants of the same name carrying on
business to-day, and whom the <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "dieresis missing in original">Moëts
in their simplicity dubbed a
“Milord”       and in 1790 the customers of the house include Power and
Michel, of 44, Lamb Street, London, and Manning, of the St. Alban
Tavern, the latter of whom is supplied on March 30th with 130 bottles of
champagne at three livres, or two “schillings,” per bottle; while a
month later Mr. Lockart, banker, of 36, Pall Mall, is debited with 360
bottles, vintage 1788, at three shillings.









WASHING BOTTLES AT MESSRS. MOËT       CHANDON’S, EPERNAY.
(p.      105)

In this same year M. Moët despatches a traveller to England named
Jeanson, and his letters, some two hundred in number, are all preserved
in the archives of the house. On the 17th May, 1790, he writes from
London as follows:       “As yet I have only gone on preparatory and
often useless errands. I      have distributed samples of which I have
no news. Patience is necessary, and I endeavour to provide myself with
it. How the taste of this country has changed since ten years ago!
Almost everywhere they ask for dry wine, but at the same time require it
so vinous and so strong that there is scarcely any other than the wine
of Sillery which can satisfy them.... To-morrow I dine five miles from
here, at M.      Macnamara’s. We shall uncork four bottles of our wine,
which will probably be all right.” In May, 1792, Jean Remi Moët is
married, and thenceforward assumes the full management of the house. On
December 20 of the year following, when the Reign of Terror was fairly
inaugurated, we find the accounts in the ledger opened to this or the
other “citoyen.” The orthodox Republican formula, however, did not long
continue, and “sieur” and “monsieur” resumed their accustomed places,
showing that Jean Remi Moët had no sympathy with the Jacobin faction of
the day. In 1805 he became
105

Mayor of Epernay, and between this time and the fall of the Empire
received Napoleon several times at his residence, as well as the Empress
Josephine and the King of Westphalia. The Emperor, after recapturing
Reims from the Allies, came on to Epernay, on which occasion he
presented M.      Moët with the cross of the Legion of Honour. In 1830
the latter was arbitrarily dismissed from his mayoralty by Charles X.,
but was speedily reinstated by Louis Philippe, though he did not retain
his office for long, his advanced age compelling him to retire from
active life in the course of 1833. At this epoch the firm, which, since
1807 had been known as Moët and Co., was remodelled under the style of
Moët and Chandon, the two partners being M.      Victor Moët, son of the
outgoing partner, and M.      P.      G. Chandon, the descendant of an
old ennobled family of the Mâconnais, who had married M.      Jean Remi
Moët’s eldest daughter. The descendants of these gentlemen are to-day at
the head of the business, the partners being on the one hand
M.      Victor Moët-Romont and M.      C.      J.      V. Auban
Moët-Romont; and on the other, MM.      Paul and Raoul Chandon de
Briailles.

Facing Messrs. Moët and Chandon’s offices at Epernay is a range of
comparatively new buildings, with its white façade ornamented with the
well-known monogram M.      and      C., surmounted by the familiar
star. It is here that the business of blending and bottling the wine is
carried on. Passing through the arched gateway access is obtained to a
spacious courtyard, where carts laden with bottles are being
expeditiously lightened of their fragile contents by the busy hands of
numerous workmen. Another gateway on the left leads into the spacious
bottle-washing room, which from the middle of May until the middle of
July presents a scene of extraordinary animation. Bottle-washing
apparatus, supplied by a steam-engine with 20,000 gallons of water per
diem, are ranged in fifteen rows down the entire length of this hall,
and nearly 200 women strive to excel each other in diligence and
celerity in their management, a      practised hand washing from 900 to
1,000 bottles in the course of the day. To the right of this salle de
rinçage, as it is styled,
106

bottles are stacked in their tens of thousands, and lads furnished with
barrows, known as diables, hurry to and fro, conveying these to
the washers, or removing the clean bottles to the adjacent courtyard,
where they are allowed to drain, prior to being taken to the salle de
tirage or bottling room.








MESSRS. MOËT       CHANDON’S VENDANGEOIR AT BOUZY. (p. 106)

Before, however, the washing of bottles on this gigantic scale
commences, the “marrying” or blending of the wine is accomplished in a
vast apartment, 250 feet in length and 100 feet broad, during the early
spring. The casks of newly-vintaged wine which have been stowed away
during the winter months, in the extensive range of cellars hewn out of
the chalk underlying Epernay, where they have slowly fermented, are
mixed together in due proportions in huge vats, each holding upwards of
12,000 gallons. Some of this wine is the growth of Messrs. Moët and
Chandon’s own vineyards, of which they possess as many as 900 acres
(giving constant employment to 800 labourers and vinedressers) at Ay,
Avenay, Bouzy, Cramant, Champillon, Chouilly, Dizy, Epernay, Grauves,
Hautvillers, Le Mesnil, Moussy, Pierry, Saran, St. Martin, Verzy, and
Verzenay, and the average annual cost of cultivating which is about £40
per acre. At Ay the firm own 210 acres of vineyards; at Cramant and
Chouilly, nearly 180 acres; at Verzy and Verzenay, 120 acres; at Pierry
and Grauves, upwards of 100 acres; at Hautvillers, 90 acres; at Le
Mesnil, 80 acres; at Epernay, nearly 60 acres; and at Bouzy, 55 acres.
Messrs. Moët and Chandon, moreover, possess vendangeoirs, or
pressing-houses, at Ay, Bouzy, Cramant, Epernay, Hautvillers, Le Mesnil,
Pierry, Saran, and Verzenay, in which the large number of 40 presses are
installed. At these vendangeoirs no less than 5,450 pièces of fine white
wine, sufficient for 1,360,000 bottles of champagne, are annually
made       that is, 1,200 pièces at Ay, 1,100 at Cramant and Saran, 800
at Verzy and Verzenay, and smaller quantities at the remaining
establishments. All these establishments have their celliers and their
cellars, together with cottages for the accommodation of the numerous
vinedressers in the employment of the firm.








BOTTLING CHAMPAGNE AT MESSRS. MOËT       CHANDON’S, EPERNAY.
(p.      107)

Extensive as are the vineyards owned by Messrs. Moët and
107

Chandon, the yield from them is utterly inadequate to the enormous
demand which the great Epernay firm are annually called upon to supply,
and large purchases have to be made by their agents from the growers
throughout the Champagne. The wine thus secured, as well as that grown
by the firm, is duly mixed together in such proportions as will ensure
lightness with the requisite vinosity, and fragrance combined with
effervescence, a      thorough amalgamation being effected by stirring
up the wine with long poles provided with fan-shaped ends. If the
vintage be indifferent in quality the firm have scores of huge tuns
filled with the yield of more favoured seasons to fall back upon to
ensure any deficiencies of character and flavour being supplied.

The casks of wine to be blended are raised from the cellars, half a
dozen at a time, by means of a lift provided with an endless chain, and
worked by the steam-engine of which we have already spoken. They are
emptied, through traps in the floor of the room above, into the huge
vats which, standing upon a raised platform, reach almost to the
ceiling. From these vats the fluid is allowed to flow through hose into
rows of casks stationed below. Before being bottled the wine reposes for
a certain time, is next duly racked and again blended, and is eventually
conveyed through silver-plated pipes into oblong reservoirs, each fitted
with a dozen syphon-taps, so arranged that directly the bottle slipped
on to one of them becomes full the wine ceases to flow.





Upwards of 200 workpeople are employed in the salle de tirage
at Messrs. Moët and Chandon’s, which, while the operation of bottling is
going on, presents a scene of bewildering activity. Men and lads are
gathered round the syphon-taps briskly removing the bottles as they
become filled, and supplanting them by empty ones. Other lads hasten to
transport the filled bottles on trucks to the corkers, whose so-called
“guillotine” machines send the corks home with a sudden thud. The corks
being secured with agrafes the bottles are placed in large flat
baskets called manettes, and wheeled away on tracks, the quarts
being deposited in the cellars by means of lifts, while the pints slide
108

down an inclined plane by the aid of an endless chain, which raises the
trucks with the empty baskets at the same time the full ones make their
descent into the cellars. What with the incessant thud of the corking
machines, the continual rolling of iron-wheeled trucks over the concrete
floor, the rattling and creaking of the machinery working the lifts, the
occasional sharp report of a bursting bottle, and the loudly-shouted
orders of the foremen, who display the national partiality for making a
noise to perfection, the din becomes at times all but unbearable. The
number of bottles filled in the course of the day naturally varies,
still Messrs. Moët and Chandon reckon that during the month of June a
daily average of 100,000 are taken in the morning from the stacks in the
salle de rinçage, washed, dried, filled, corked, wired, lowered
into the cellars and carefully arranged in symmetrical order. This
represents a
109

total of two and a half million bottles during that month alone.

The bottles on being lowered into the cellars, either by means of the
incline or the lifts, are placed in a horizontal position, and with
their uppermost side daubed with white chalk, are stacked in layers from
two to half-a-dozen bottles deep with narrow oak laths between. The
stacks are usually about six or seven feet high and 100 feet and upwards
in length. Whilst the wine is thus reposing in a temperature of about
55° Fahrenheit, fermentation sets in, and the ensuing month is one of
much anxiety. Thanks, however, to the care bestowed, Messrs. Moët and
Chandon’s annual loss from bottles bursting rarely exceeds three per
cent., though fifteen was once regarded as a respectable and
satisfactory average. The broken glass is a perquisite of the workmen,
the money arising from its sale, which at the last distribution amounted
to no less than 20,000 francs, being divided amongst them every couple
of years.





The usual entrance to Messrs. Moët and Chandon’s Epernay
cellars       which, burrowed out in all directions, are of the
aggregate length of nearly seven miles, and have usually between
11,000,000 and 12,000,000 bottles and 25,000 casks of wine stored
therein       is through a wide and imposing portal, and down a long and
broad flight of steps. It is, however, by the ancient and less imposing
entrance, through which more than one crowned head has condescended to
pass, that we set forth on our lengthened tour through these intricate
underground galleries       this subterranean city with its miles of
streets, crossroads, open spaces, tramways, and stations devoted solely
to champagne. A      gilt inscription on a black marble tablet testifies
that “on the 26th July, 1807, Napoleon the Great, Emperor of the French,
King of Italy, and Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine, honoured
commerce by visiting the cellars of Jean Rémi Moët, Mayor of Epernay,
President of the Canton, and Member of the General Council of the
Department,” within three weeks of the signature of the treaty of
Tilsit. Passing down the flight of steep slippery steps traversed by the
victor of
110

Eylau and Jena, access is gained to the upper range of vaults,
brilliantly illuminated by the glare of gas, or dimly lighted by the
flickering flame of tallow-candles, upwards of 60,000lbs. of which are
annually consumed. Here group after group of the small army of 350
workmen employed in these subterranean galleries are encountered engaged
in the process of transforming the vin brut into champagne. At
Messrs. Moët and Chandon’s the all-important operation of liqueuring the
wine is effected by aid of machines of the latest construction, which
regulate the quantity administered to the utmost nicety. The corks are
111

branded by being pressed against steel dies heated by gas, by women who
can turn out 3,000 per day apiece, the quantity of string used to secure
them amounting to nearly ten tons in the course of the year.

There is another and a lower depth of cellars to be explored to which
access is gained by trapholes in the floor       through which the
barrels and baskets of wine are raised and lowered       and by flights
of steps. From the foot of the latter there extends an endless vista of
lofty and spacious passages hewn out of the chalk, the walls of which,
smooth as finished masonry, are lined with thousands of casks of raw
wine, varied at intervals by gigantic vats. Miles of long, dark-brown,
dampish-looking galleries stretch away to the right and left, and though
devoid of the picturesque festoons of fungi which decorate the London
Dock vaults, exhibit a sufficient degree of mouldiness to give them an
air of respectable antiquity. These multitudinous galleries, lit up by
petroleum-lamps, are mostly lined with wine in bottles stacked in
compact masses to a height of six or seven feet, only room enough for a
single person to pass being left. Millions of bottles are thus arranged,
the majority on their sides, in huge piles, with tablets hung up against
each stack to note its age and quality; and the rest, which are
undergoing daily evolutions at the hands of the twister, at various
angles of inclination. In these cellars there are nearly 11,000 racks in
which the bottles of vin brut rest sur pointe, as many as
600,000 bottles being commonly twisted daily.

The way runs on between regiments of bottles of the same size and
shape, save where at intervals pints take the place of quarts; and the
visitor, gazing into the black depths of the transverse passages to the
right and left, becomes conscious of a feeling that if his guide were
suddenly to desert him he would feel as hopelessly lost as in the
catacombs of Rome. There are two galleries, each 650 feet in length,
containing about 650,000 bottles, and connected by 32 transverse
galleries, with an aggregate length of 4,000 feet, in which nearly
1,500,000 bottles are stored. There are, further, eight galleries, each
500 feet in
112

length, and proportionably stocked; also the extensive new vaults,
excavated some five or six years back, in the rear of the then-existing
cellarage, and a considerable number of smaller vaults. The different
depths and varying degrees of moisture afford a choice of temperature of
which the experienced owners know how to take advantage. The original
vaults, wherein more than a century ago the first bottles of champagne
made by the infant firm were stowed away, bear the name of Siberia, on
account of their exceeding coldness. This section consists of several
roughly-excavated low winding galleries, resembling natural caverns, and
affording a striking contrast to the broad, lofty, and regular-shaped
corridors of more recent date.









THE PACKING HALL AT MESSRS. MOËT AND CHANDON’S, EPERNAY. (p. 112)

When the proper period arrives for the bottles to emerge once more
into the upper air they are conveyed to the packing-room,
a      spacious hall 180 feet long and 60 feet broad. In front of its
three large double doors waggons are drawn up ready to receive their
loads. The seventy men and women employed here easily foil, label, wrap,
and pack up some 10,000 bottles a day. Cases and baskets are stacked in
different parts of this vast hall, at one end of which numerous trusses
of straw used in the packing are piled. Seated at tables ranged along
one side of the apartment women are busily occupied in pasting on labels
or encasing the necks of bottles in gold or silver foil, whilst
elsewhere men, seated on three-legged stools in front of smoking
caldrons of molten sealing-wax of a deep green hue, are coating the
necks of other bottles by plunging them into the boiling fluid. When
labelled and decorated with either wax or foil the bottles pass on to
other women, who swathe them in pink tissue-paper and set them aside for
the packers, by whom, after being deftly wrapped round with straw, they
are consigned to baskets or cases, to secure which last no less than
10,000lbs. of nails are annually used. England and Russia are partial to
gold foil, pink paper, and wooden cases holding a dozen or a couple of
dozen bottles of the exhilarating fluid, whereas other nations prefer
waxed necks, disdain pink paper,
113

and insist on being supplied in wicker baskets containing fifty bottles
each.

Some idea of the complex character of so vast an establishment as
that of Messrs. Moët and Chandon may be gathered from a mere enumeration
of their staff, which, in addition to twenty clerks and 350 cellarmen
proper, includes numerous agrafe-makers and corkcutters, packers and
carters, wheelwrights and saddlers, carpenters, masons, slaters and
tilers, tinmen, firemen, needlewomen,      c., while the inventory of
objects used by this formidable array of workpeople comprises no fewer
than 1,500 distinct heads. A      medical man attached to the
establishment gives gratuitous advice to all those employed, and a
chemist dispenses drugs and medicines without charge. While suffering
from illness the men receive half-pay, but should they be laid up by an
accident met with in the course of their work full salary is invariably
awarded to them. As may be supposed, so vast an establishment as this is
not without a provision for those past work, and all the old hands
receive liberal pensions from the firm upon retiring. Every year Messrs.
Moët and Chandon give a banquet or a ball to the people in their
employ       usually after the bottling of the wine is
completed       when the hall in which the entertainment takes place is
handsomely decorated and illuminated with myriads of coloured lamps.

It is needless to particularise Messrs. Moët and Chandon’s wines,
which are familiar to all drinkers of champagne. Their famous “star”
brand is known in all societies, figures equally at clubs and
mess-tables, at garden parties and picnics, dinners and soirées,
and has its place in hotel cartes all over the world. One of the
best proofs of the wine’s universal popularity is found in the
circumstance that as many as 1,000 visitors from all parts of the world
come annually to Epernay and make the tour of Messrs. Moët and Chandon’s
spacious cellars.

A little beyond Messrs. Moët and Chandon’s, in the broad Rue du
Commerce, we encounter a heavy, ornate, pretentious-looking château, the
residence of M.      Perrier-Jouët, which presents a striking contrast
to the almost mean-looking premises opposite,
114

where the business of the firm is carried on. M.      Perrier-Jouët is
the fortunate grandson of the Sieur Perrier Fissier, a      little
Epernay grocer, who some eighty years or so ago used to supply corks,
candles, and string to the firm of Moët and Co., and who, when the
profits arising from this connection warranted his doing so, discarded
his grocer’s sleeves and apron and blossomed forth as a competitor in
the champagne trade. Perrier-Jouët and Co.’s offices are situated on the
left-hand side of a courtyard surrounded by low buildings, which serve
as celliers, store-houses, packing-rooms, and the like. From an inner
courtyard where piles of bottles are stacked under open sheds, the
cellars themselves are reached. Previous to descending into these we
passed through the various buildings, in one of which a party of men
were engaged in disgorging and preparing wine for shipment. In another
we noticed one of those heavy beam presses for pressing the grapes which
the more intelligent manufacturers regard as obsolete, while in a third
was the cuvée vat, holding no more than 2,200 gallons. In making
their cuvée the firm commonly mix one part of old wine to three
parts of new. An indifferent vintage, however, necessitates the
admixture of a larger proportion of the older growth. The cellars, like
all the more ancient ones at Epernay, are somewhat straggling and
irregular, still they are remarkably cool, and on the lower floor
remarkably damp as well. This, however, would appear to be no
disadvantage, as the breakage in them is calculated never to exceed 2½
per cent.

The firm have no less than five qualities of champagne, and at one of
the recent champagne competitions at London, where the experts engaged
had no means of identifying the brands submitted to their judgment,
Messrs. Perrier-Jouët’s First Quality got classed below a cheaper wine
of their neighbours Messrs. Pol Roger and Co., and very considerably
below the Extra Sec of Messrs. Périnet et fils, and inferior even to a
wine of De Venoge’s, the great Epernay manufacturer of common class
champagnes.

Champagne establishments, combined with the handsome residences of
the manufacturers, line both sides of the long,
115

imposing Rue du Commerce at Epernay. On the left hand is a succession of
fine châteaux, commencing with one belonging to M.      Auban Moët,
whose terraced gardens overlook the valley of the Marne, and command
views of the vine-clad heights of Cumières, Hautvillers, Ay, and
Mareuil, and the more distant slopes of Ambonnay and Bouzy, while on the
other side of the famous Epernay thoroughfare we encounter beyond the
establishments of Messrs. Moët and Chandon and Perrier-Jouët the ornate
monumental façade which the firm of Piper and Co.       of whom Messrs.
Kunkelmann and Co. are to-day the successors       raised some years
since above their extensive cellars. A      little in the rear of the
Rue du Commerce is the well-ordered establishment of Messrs. Roussillon
and Co., the extension of whose business of late has necessitated their
removal to these capacious premises. The wines of the firm enjoy a high
reputation in England, France, and Russia, and have secured favourable
recognition at the Paris, Philadelphia, and other Exhibitions. Their
stock includes considerable quantities of the older vintages, it being a
rule of the house never to ship crude young wines. It is on their dry
varieties that Messrs. Roussillon and Co. especially pride themselves,
and some of the fine wine of 1874 that was here shown to us was as
remarkable for its delicacy as for its fragrance.









COURTYARD OF MESSRS. POL ROGER’S ESTABLISHMENT AT EPERNAY.
(p.      115)

In a side street at the farther end of the Rue du Commerce stands a
château of red brick, overlooking on the one side an extensive
pleasure-garden, and on the other a spacious courtyard, bounded by
celliers, stables, and bottle-sheds, all of modern construction and on a
most extensive scale. These form the establishment of Messrs. Pol Roger
and Co., settled for many years at Epernay, and known throughout the
Champagne for their large purchases at the epoch of the vintage. From
the knowledge they possess of the best crûs, and their relations with
the leading vineyard proprietors, they are enabled whenever the wine is
good to acquire large stocks of it. Having bottled a considerable
quantity of the fine wine of 1874, they resolved to profit by the
exceptional quality of this vintage to commence shipping champagne to
England, where their agents,
116

Messrs. Reuss, Lauteren, and Co., have successfully introduced the new
brand.

Passing through a large open gateway we enter the vast courtyard of
the establishment, which, with arriving and departing carts       the
first loaded with wine in cask or with new bottles, and the others with
cases of champagne       presents rather an animated scene. Under a roof
projecting from the wall of the vast cellier on the right hand a tribe
of “Sparnaciennes”       as the feminine inhabitants of Epernay are
termed       are occupied in washing bottles in readiness for the coming
tirage. The surrounding buildings, most substantially constructed, are
not destitute of architectural pretensions.

The extensive cellier, the area of which is 23,589 square feet, is
understood to be the largest single construction of the kind in the
Champagne district. Built entirely of iron, stone and brick, its
framework is a perfect marvel of lightness. The roof, consisting of rows
of brick arches, is covered above with a layer of Portland cement, in
order to keep it cool in summer and protect it against the winter cold,
two most desirable objects in connection with the manipulation of
champagne. Here an endless chain of a new pattern enables wine in bottle
to be lowered and raised with great rapidity to or from the cellars
beneath       lofty and capacious excavations of two stories, the lowest
of which is reached by a flight of no less than 170 steps.

Epernay, unlike Reims, has little of general interest to attract the
stranger. Frequently besieged and pillaged during the Middle Ages, and
burnt to the ground by the dauphin, son of François      I., the town,
although of some note as far back as the time of Clovis, exhibits to-day
no evidence whatever of its great antiquity. The thoroughfare termed the
Rempart de la Tour Biron recalls a memorable incident which transpired
during the siege of the town by Henri IV. While the king was
reconnoitring the defences a cannon-ball aimed at his waving white plume
took off the head of the Maréchal Biron at the moment Henri’s hand was
resting familiarly on the maréchal’s shoulder. Strange to say, the king
himself escaped unhurt.

The
historic bourgade of Ay is within a short walk of the station on
the line of railway connecting Epernay with Reims. The road lies across
the light bridge spanning the Marne canal, the tall trees fringing which
hide for a time the clustering houses; still we catch sight of the
tapering steeple of the antique church rising sharply against the green
vine-covered slopes and the fleecy-clouded summer sky. We soon reach the
Place de l’Hôtel de Ville, and continuing onward in the direction of the
steep hills which shelter the town on the north, come to a
massive-looking corner house in front of the broad porte-cochère
of which some railway carts laden with cases of champagne are standing.
Passing through the gateway we find ourselves in an open court, with a
dwelling-house to the right and a range of buildings in front where the
offices of Messrs. Deutz and Geldermann are installed. This is the
central establishment of the firm, whose Extra Dry “Gold Lack” and
“Cabinet” champagnes have long been favourably known in England. Here
are spacious celliers for disgorging and finishing off the wine,
a      large packing-hall, and rooms where bales of corks and other
accessories of the trade are stored, the operations of making the
cuvées and bottling being accomplished in an establishment some
little distance off.









VIEW OF AY FROM THE BANKS OF THE MARNE CANAL. (p. 117.)

Proceeding thither, we find an elegant château with a charming
terraced garden, lying at the very foot of the vine-clad slopes, and on
the opposite side of the road some large celliers where wine in wood is
stored, and where the cuvées of the firm, consisting usually of
upwards of 50,000 gallons each, are made in a vat of gigantic
proportions, furnished with a raised platform at one end for the
accommodation of the workman who agitates the customary paddles. When
the wine is completely blended it is drawn off into casks disposed for
the purpose in the cellar below, as shown in the accompanying engraving,
and after being fined it rests for about a month to clear itself. To
each of these
119

casks of newly-blended wine a portion of old wine is added separately,
and at the moment of bottling the whole is newly amalgamated.








DRAWING OFF THE CUVÉE AT DEUTZ       GELDERMANN’S, AY. (p. 118)

Adjoining M. Deutz’s château is the principal entrance to the
extensive cellars of the firm, to which, at the time of our visit,
considerable additions were being made. In excavating a gallery the
workmen commence by rounding off the roof, and then proceed to work
gradually downwards, extracting the chalk, whenever practicable, in
blocks suitable for building purposes, which being worth from three to
four shillings the square yard help to reduce the cost of the
excavation. When any serious flaws present themselves in the sides or
roof of the galleries, they are invariably made good with masonry.








EXCAVATING DEUTZ       GELDERMANN’S NEW CELLARS, AY. (p. 119)

This range of cellars now comprises eight long and lofty galleries no
less than 17 feet wide, and the same number of feet in height, and of
the aggregate length of 2,200 yards. These spacious vaults, which run
parallel with each other, and communicate by means of cross passages,
underlie the street, the château, the garden, and the vineyard slopes
beyond, and possess the great advantage of being always dry. They are
capable, we were informed, of containing several million bottles of
champagne in addition to a large quantity of wine in cask.

Messrs. Deutz and Geldermann possess vineyards at Ay, and own a large
vendangeoir at Verzenay, where in good years they usually press 500
pièces of wine. They, moreover, make large purchases of grapes at Bouzy,
Cramant, Le Mesnil, Pierry,      c, and invariably have these pressed
under their own superintendence. Beyond large shipments to England,
Messrs. Deutz and Geldermann transact a considerable business with other
countries, and more especially with Germany, where their brand has been
for years one of the most popular, and is to-day the favourite at
numerous regimental messes and the principal hotels.

The old château of Ay, which dates from the early part of the last
century, belongs to-day to the Count de Mareuil, a      member of the
firm of Ayala and Co., one of the leading establishments
120

of the famous Marne-side crû. Perched half-way up the slope, covered
with “golden plants,” which rises in the rear of the village, the
château, with its long façade of windows, commands the valley of the
Marne for miles, and from the stately terraced walk, planted with
ancient lime-trees, geometrically clipped in the fashion of the last
century, a      splendid view of the distant vineyards of Avize,
Cramant, Epernay, and Chouilly is obtained. The château formed one of a
quartette of seignorial residences which at the commencement of the
present century belonged to Balthazar Constance Dangé-Dorçay, whose
ancestors had been lords of Chouilly under the ancien régime.
Dorçay had inherited from an aunt the châteaux of Ay, Mareuil,
Boursault, and Chouilly, together with a large patrimony in land and
money; but a mania for gambling brought him to utter ruin, and he
dispossessed himself of money, lands, and châteaux in succession, and
was reduced, in his old age, to earn a meagre pittance as a
violin-player at the Paris Opera House. The old château of Boursault,
which still exists contiguous to the stately edifice raised by Mme.
Clicquot on the summit of the hill, was risked and lost on a single game
at cards by this pertinacious gamester, whose pressing pecuniary
difficulties compelled him to sell the remaining châteaux one by one.
That of Ay was purchased by M.      Froc de la Boulaye, and by him
bequeathed to his cousin the Count de Mareuil, whose granddaughter
became the wife of one of the Messrs. Ayala, and whose son is to-day
their partner.









MESSRS. AYALA       CO.’S ESTABLISHMENT AT AY. (p. 121)

The offices of the firm adjoin the château, and rather higher up the
hill is their very complete establishment, picturesquely situated in a
hollow formed by some excavations, with the thickly-planted vine-slopes
rising above its red-tiled roof. The boldly-designed basement, the
ascending sweep conducting to the extensive celliers and the little
centre belfry give a character of originality to the building. Carts
laden with cases of champagne are leaving for the railway station, casks
of wine are being transferred from one part of the establishment to
another, bottles are being got ready for the approaching tirage, and in
121

the packing department, installed in one of the three celliers into
which the story aboveground is divided, quite an animated scene presents
itself. Iron columns support the roofs of this and its companion
celliers, where the firm make their cuvée, and the bottling of
the wine takes place. On descending into the basement beneath, the
popping of corks and the continual clatter of machinery intimate that
the disgorging and re-corking of the wine are being accomplished, and in
the dim light we discern groups of workmen engaged in the final
manipulation which champagne has to undergo, while fresh relays of wine
are arriving from the cellars by the aid of endless chains. There are
two stories of these cellars which, excavated in the chalk, extend under
the road and wind round beneath the château, the more modern galleries
being broad, lofty, and admirably ventilated, and provided with supports
of masonry wherever the instability of the chalk rendered this
requisite. After a lengthened promenade through them we come to the
ancient vaults extending immediately under the grounds of the château,
where every particle of available space is utilised, and some difficulty
is found in passing between the serried piles of bottles of vin
brut       mostly the fine wine of 1874       which rise
continuously on either side.





Within a hundred yards of the open space, surrounded by houses of
different epochs and considerable diversity of design, where the Ay
market is weekly held, and in one of the narrow winding streets common
to the town, an escutcheon, with a bunch of grapes for device,
surmounting a lofty gateway, attracts attention. Within, a      trim
courtyard, girt round with orange-trees in bright green boxes, and
clipped in orthodox fashion, affords access to the handsome residence
and offices of M.      Duminy, well-known in England
122

and America as a shipper of high-class champagnes, and whose Parisian
connection is extensive. On the right-hand side of the courtyard is the
packing-room, and through the cellars, which have an entrance here, one
can reach the celliers in an adjoining street, where the cuvée is
made and the bottling of the wine accomplished.

M. Duminy’s cellars are remarkably old, and consequently of somewhat
irregular construction, being at times rather low and narrow, as well as
on different levels. In addition, however, to these venerable vaults,
packed with wines of 1869, ’70, ’72, and ’74, M.      Duminy has various
subterranean adjuncts in other parts of Ay, and is at present engaged in
constructing, at the foot of his vineyards up the mountain slope,
a      noble establishment which includes a vast court, upwards of a
thousand square yards in extent, wherein are installed capacious
bottle-racks and bottle-washing machines of the latest improved
manufacture. Here are also handsome and extensive celliers, together
with immense underground cellars, comprising broad and lofty galleries
of regular design, the whole being constructed with a completeness and
studied regard for convenience which bid fair to render this
establishment when finished the model one of the Champagne district.

The house was originally founded so far back as 1814 by
M.      Taverne-Richard, who was intimately connected with the principal
vineyard proprietors of the district. In 1842 this gentleman took his
son-in-law, M.      Duminy, father of the present proprietor of the
establishment, into partnership, and after the retirement of
M.      Taverne he gave a great impetus to the business, and succeeded
in introducing his light and delicate wines into the principal Paris
hotels and restaurants. During its two-thirds of a century of existence
the house has invariably confined itself to first-class wines, taking
particular pride in shipping fully-matured growths. Besides its own
large reserve of these, it holds considerable stocks long since disposed
of, and now merely awaiting the purchasers’ orders to be shipped.

123

A few paces beyond M. Duminy’s we come upon an antiquated,
decrepit-looking timber house, with its ancient gable bulging over as
though the tough oak brackets on which it rests were at last grown weary
of supporting their unwieldy burthen. Judging from the quaint carved
devices, this house was doubtless the residence of an individual of some
importance in the days when the principal European potentates had their
commissioners installed at Ay to secure them the finest vintages.
Continuing our walk along the same narrow winding street, we soon reach
the establishment of Messrs. Bollinger, whose house, founded in the year
1829, claims to be the first among the Ay firms who shipped wines to
foreign countries generally, including England, where the brand has long
been held in high repute. Messrs. Bollinger, besides being shippers of
champagne, are extensive vineyard proprietors, owning vinelands at
Bouzy, Verzenay, and Dizy. A      vineyard of theirs at the latter
place, known as “La Grange,” is said to have formerly belonged to the
monks who founded the abbey of St. Peter at Hautvillers, the legend
connected with which we have already related.

A couple of large gateways offer access to the spacious courtyard of
Messrs. Bollinger’s establishment; a      handsome dwelling-house
standing on the right, and a small pavilion, in which the offices are
installed, while on the left hand and in the rear of the courtyard rises
a range of buildings of characteristic aspect, appropriated to the
business of the firm. In one of the celliers, which has its
open-raftered roof supported by slim metal columns, we found the tirage
going on, the gang of workmen engaged in it filling, corking, and
lowering into the cellars some 20,000 bottles a day. In one corner of
the apartment stood the large cuvée tun       capable of holding
some 50 hogsheads       in which the blending of the wine is effected,
and in an adjoining cellier women were briskly labelling and wrapping up
the completed bottles of champagne. The cellars, constructed some fifty
years ago at a cost of nearly £12 the superficial yard, are faced
entirely with stone, and are
124

alike wide and lofty; this is especially the case with four of the more
modern galleries excavated in 1848, and each 160 feet in length. Besides
the foregoing, Messrs. Bollinger possess other cellars in Ay, where they
store their reserve wines both in bottle and in the wood.

On the northern side of Ay, some little distance from the vineyard
owned by them, the firm of Pfungst frères       Cie. have their cellars,
the entrance to which lies just under the lofty vine-clad ridge. Messrs.
Pfungst frères lay themselves out exclusively for the shipment of
high-class champagnes, and the excellent growths of the Ay district
necessarily form an important element in their carefully-composed
cuvées. A      considerable portion of their stock consists of
reserves of old wine, and we tasted here a variety of samples of
finely-matured champagnes of 1868 and ’70, as well as the vintages of
1872 and ’74. All of these wines were of superior quality, combining
delicacy and fragrance with dryness, the latter being their especial
feature. In addition to their business with England, Messrs. Pfungst
frères ship largely to India and the United States.






It is on this side of the town that the fine old Gothic church,
dating as far back as the twelfth century, is situated. Many of the
mouldings and the capitals of the columns both inside and outside the
building are covered over with grape-laden vine-branches, and the
sculptured figure of a boy bearing a basket of grapes upon his head
surmounts the handsome Renaissance doorway, seemingly to indicate the
honour in which the
125

vine       the source of all the prosperity of the little town       was
held both by the mediæval and later architects of the edifice. Nigh to
the church stands the old house with its obliterated carved escutcheons,
known traditionally as the Vendangeoir of Henri Quatre. This monarch
loved the wine of the place almost as well as his favourite vintage of
Arbois, and dubbed himself, as we have already mentioned, Seigneur of
Ay, whose inhabitants he sought to gratify by confirming the charter
which centuries before had been granted to the town.






Within half-an-hour’s walk of Ay, in an easterly direction, is the
village of Mareuil, a      long straight street of straggling houses,
bounded by trees and <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "text unchanged">garden-plats,
with vine-clad hills rising abruptly
behind on the one side, and the Marne canal flowing placidly by on the
other. The archaic church, a      mixture of the Romanesque and Early
Gothic, stands at the farther end of the village, and some little
distance on this side of it is a massive-looking eighteenth-century
building, spacious enough to accommodate a regiment of horse, but
conventual rather than barrack-like in aspect, from the paucity of
windows looking on to the road. A      broad gateway leads into a
spacious courtyard to the left of which stands a grand château, while on
the right there rises an ornate round tower of three stories, from the
gallery on the summit of which a fine view over the valley of the Marne
is obtained. The buildings inclosing the court on three sides comprise
press-houses, celliers, and packing-rooms,
126

an antiquated sundial marking the hour on the blank space above the
vines that climb beside the entrance gateway. The more ancient of these
tenements formed the vendangeoir of the Dukes of Orleans at the time
they owned the château of Mareuil, purchased in 1830 by the Duke de
Montebello, son of the famous Marshal Lannes, and minister and
ambassador of Louis Philippe and Napoleon III.








THE MONTEBELLO ESTABLISHMENT AT MAREUIL. (p. 126)

The acquisition of this property, to which were attached some
important vineyards, led, several years later, to the duke’s founding,
in conjunction with his brothers, the Marquis and General Count de
Montebello, a      champagne firm, whose brand speedily acquired a
notable popularity. To-day the business is carried on by their sons and
heirs, for all the original partners in the house have followed their
valiant father to the grave. Struck down by an Austrian cannon-ball in
the zenith of his fame, the career of Marshal Lannes, brief as it was,
furnishes one of the most brilliant pages in French military annals.
Joining the army of Italy as a volunteer in 1796, he was made a colonel
on the battle-field in the gorges of Millesimo, when Augereau’s bold
advance opened Piedmont to the French. He fought at Bassano and Lodi,
took part in the assault of Pavia and the siege of Mantua, and at
Arcola, when Napoleon dashed flag in hand upon the bridge, Lannes was
seriously wounded whilst shielding his general from danger. He
afterwards distinguished himself in Egypt, and led the van of the French
army across the Alps, displaying his accustomed bravery both at
Montebello and Marengo. At Austerlitz, where he commanded the right wing
of the army, he greatly contributed to the victory, and at Jena,
Friedland, and Eylau his valour was again conspicuous. Sent to Spain, he
defeated the Spaniards at Tudela, and took part in the operations
against Saragossa. Wounded at the battle of Essling, when the Archduke
Charles inflicted upon Napoleon      I. the first serious repulse he had
met with on the field of battle, the valiant Lannes expired a few days
afterwards in the Emperor’s arms.








CHÂTEAU OF MAREUIL, BELONGING TO THE DUKE OF MONTEBELLO. (p. 127.)

We were met at Mareuil, on the occasion of our visit, by
127

Count Alfred Ferdinand de Montebello, the present manager of the house,
and conducted by him over the establishment. In the press-house, to the
left of the courtyard, were two of the ponderous presses used in the
Champagne, for, like all other large firms, the house makes its own
wine. Grapes grown in the Mareuil vineyards arrive here in baskets slung
across the backs of mules, muzzled so that while awaiting their loads
they may not devour the fruit within reach. In a cellier adjoining the
press-house stands a large vat, capable of holding 50 pièces of wine,
with a crane beside it for hauling up the casks when the cuvée is
made. Here the tirage likewise takes place, and in the range of
buildings, roofed with glass, in the rear of the tower, the bottled wine
is labelled, capped with foil, and packed in cases for transmission to
Paris, England, and other places abroad.

A double flight of steps, decorated with lamps and vases, leads to
the handsome offices of the firm, situated on the first floor of the
tower, while above is an apartment with a panelled ceiling, gracefully
decorated with groups of Cupids engaged in the vintage and the various
operations which the famous wines of the Mountain and the River undergo
during their conversion into champagne. On the ground floor of the tower
a low doorway conducts to the spacious cellars, which, owing to the
proximity of the Marne, are all on the same level as well as constructed
in masonry. The older vaults, where the Marquis de Pange, a      former
owner of the château, stored the wine which he used to sell to the
champagne manufacturers, are somewhat low and tortuous compared with the
broad and lofty galleries of more recent date, which have been
constructed as the growing connection of the firm obliged them to
increase their stocks. Spite, however, of numerous additions, portions
of their reserves have to be stored in other cellars in Mareuil.
Considerable stocks of each of the four qualities of wine supplied by
the firm are being got ready for disgorgement, including Cartes Noires
and Bleues, with the refined Carte Blanche and the delicate Crêmant,
which challenge comparison with brands of the highest repute.

In the adjacent château, the gardens of which slope down
128

to the Marne canal, there are various interesting portraits, with one or
two relics of the distinguished founder of the Montebello family,
notably Marshal Lannes’s gold-embroidered velvet saddle trappings, his
portrait and that of Marshal Gerard, as well as one of Napoleon      I.,
by David, with a handsome clock and candelabra of Egyptian design,
a      bust of Augustus Cæsar, and a portrait of the Regent
d’Orléans.

Another champagne house of standing at Mareuil is that of
Bruch-Foucher and Co., whose establishment is situated near the village
mairie. Entering by a lofty porte-cochère, we notice on the left hand a
spacious packing-room, where men and women are expeditiously completing
some shipping order, while beyond are the offices, looking on to a
terraced garden whence a pleasant view is gained of the verdant valley
of the Marne. From the packing-room a broad staircase leads to the
cellars beneath, which can also be reached from a venerable range of
buildings on the opposite side of the road, where young wines and old
cognac spirit, used in the preparation of the liqueur, are stored in the
wood.

In one of these ancient celliers is a vast tun, capable of containing
nearly 5,000 gallons, carved over with an elaborate device of vineleaves
and bunches of grapes entwined around overflowing cornucopia and bottles
of champagne. This handsome cask, in which the firm make their
cuvée, is a worthy rival of the sole antique ornamental tun that
still reposes in the Royal cellars at Wurzburg. In Messrs. Bruch-Foucher
and Co.’s capacious cellars, faced and vaulted with stone, from eight to
nine hundred thousand bottles of wine are stored. The cellars form a
single story, and extend partly under the adjacent vineyard slopes,
deriving light and ventilation from numerous shafts which are
occasionally no less than 150 feet in height. Messrs. Bruch-Foucher and
Co., who are owners of vineyards at Mareuil, ship three qualities of
champagne, the finest being their Carte d’Or and their Monogram Carte
Blanche. Their chief business is with England, Germany, and the United
States, where their brands enjoy considerable repute.

Avize,
situated in the heart of the Champagne white grape district, may be
reached from Epernay by road through Pierry and Cramant or by the
Châlons Railway to Oiry Junction, between which station and Romilly
there runs a local line, jocularly termed the chemin de fer de
famille, from the general disregard displayed by the officials for
anything approaching to punctuality. Avize can scarcely be styled a
town, and yet its growing proportions are beyond those of an ordinary
village. It lies pleasantly nestled among the vines, sheltered by bold
ridges on the north-west, with the monotonous plains of La Champagne
pouilleuse, unsuited to the cultivation of the vine, stretching away
eastward in the direction of Châlons. Avize cannot pretend to the same
antiquity as its neighbour Vertus, and lacks the many picturesque
vestiges of which the latter can boast. Its church dates back only to
the 15th century, although the principal doorway in the Romanesque style
evidently belongs to a much earlier epoch. There is a general air of
trim prosperity about the place, and the villagers have that well-to-do
appearance common to the inhabitants of the French wine districts. Only
at vintage time, however, are there any particular outdoor signs of
activity, although half a score of champagne firms have their
establishments here, giving employment to the bulk of the population,
and sending forth their two or three million bottles of the sparkling
wine of the Marne annually.









MAKING THE CUVÉE AT MESSRS. GIESLER’S, AT AVIZE. (p.131)

Proceeding along the straight level road leading from the station to
the village we encounter on our right hand the premises of Messrs.
Giesler and Co., the reputation of whose brand is universal. When
M.      Giesler quitted the firm of P.      A. Mumm, Giesler, and Co.,
at Reims, in 1838, he removed to Avize and founded the present extensive
establishment. Entering through a large open gateway we find ourselves
within a spacious courtyard with a handsome dwelling-house in the rear,
and all the signs of a champagne business of magnitude apparent.
A      spiral staircase conducts to the counting-house on the first
story of a range of buildings on the left hand, the ground floor of
which is divided into celliers. Passing through
131

a door by the side of this staircase we enter a large hall where the
operation of bottling the wine is going on. Four tuns, each holding five
ordinary pièces of wine, and raised upon large blocks of wood, are
standing here, and communicating with them are bottling syphons of the
type commonly employed in the Champagne. Messrs. Giesler do not usually
consign the newly-bottled wine at once to the cellars, but retain it
aboveground for about a fortnight in order that it may develop its
effervescent qualities more perfectly. We find many thousands of these
bottles stacked horizontally in the adjoining celliers, in one of which
stands the great cuvée tun wherein some fifty hogsheads of the
finest Champagne growths are blended together at one time, two hundred
hogsheads being thus mingled daily while the cuvées are in
progress. The casks of wine having been hoisted from the cellars to the
first floor by a crane, and run on to a trough, their bungs are removed,
and the wine flows through an aperture in the floor into the huge tun
beneath, its amalgamation being accomplished by the customary fan-shaped
appliances, set in motion by the turning of a wheel. In an adjacent room
is the machine used for mixing the liqueur which Messrs. <ins class =
"mycorr" title = "text reads ‘Griesler’">Giesler add so sparingly
to their light and fragrant wines.

There are a couple of floors above these celliers, the uppermost of
which is used as a general store, while in the one beneath many
thousands of bottles of vin brut repose sur pointe, either
in racks or on tables as at the Clicquot-Werlé establishment. This
latter system requires ample space, for as the remueur, or
workman who shakes the bottles, is only able to use one hand, the
operation of dislodging the sediment necessarily occupies a much longer
time than is requisite when the bottles rest in racks.

132






PREPARING THE LIQUEUR AT MESSRS. GIESLER’S.

The buildings on the opposite side of the courtyard comprise a large
packing-hall, celliers where the wine is finished off, and rooms where
corks and such-like things are stored. Here, too, is the entrance to the
cellars, of which there are three tiers, all lofty and well-ventilated
galleries, very regular in their construction, and faced with either
stone or brick. In these extensive vaults are casks of fine reserved
wines for blending with youthful vintages, and bottles of vin
brut, built up in solid stacks, that may be reckoned by their
hundreds of thousands. At Messrs. Giesler’s the disgorging of the wine
is accomplished in
133

a small cellier partially underground, and the temperature of which is
very cool and equable. The dégorgeurs, isolated from the rest of
the workpeople, are carrying on their operations here by candlelight. So
soon as the sediment is removed the bottles are raised in baskets to the
cellier above, where the liqueuring, re-corking, stringing, and wiring
are successively accomplished. By pursuing this plan the loss sustained
by the disgorgement is believed to be reduced to a minimum.

Extensive as these premises are they are still insufficient for the
requirements of the firm, and across the road is a spacious building
where new bottles are stored and the washing of the bottles in
preparation for the tirage takes place. By the aid of the machinery
provided, sixteen women, assisted by a couple of men, commonly wash some
fifteen or sixteen thousand bottles in the course of a day. Here, too,
stands one of the two large presses with which at the epoch of the
vintage a hundred pièces of wine are pressed every four-and-twenty
hours. The remaining press is installed in a cellier at the farther end
of the garden on the other side of the road. Messrs. Giesler possess
additional presses at their vendangeoir at Bouzy, and during the vintage
have the command of presses at Ay, Verzenay, Vertus, Le Mesnil,      c.,
it being a rule of theirs always to press the grapes within a few hours
after they are gathered to obviate their becoming bruised by their own
weight and imparting a dark colour to the wine, a      contingency
difficult to guard against in seasons when the fruit is over-ripe. The
firm own vineyards at Avize, and have agreements with vine-proprietors
at Ay, Bouzy, Verzenay, and elsewhere, to purchase their crops regularly
every year. Messrs. Giesler’s brand has secured its existing high repute
solely through the fine quality of the wines shipped by the
house       wines which are known and appreciated by all real
connoisseurs of champagne.

From Messrs. Giesler’s it is merely a short walk to the establishment
of M.      Charles de Cazanove, situated in the principal street of
Avize. On entering the court we encountered a tame young boar engaged in
the lively pursuit of chasing some
134

terrified hens, while a trio of boarhounds, basking on the sunny
flagstones, contemplated his proceedings with lazy indifference. Boars
abound in the woods hereabouts, and hunting them is a favourite pastime
with the residents, and the young boar we had noticed proved to be one
of the recent captures of the sons of M.      de Cazanove, who are among
the warmest partisans of the exciting sport. Many of the boars found in
the woods around Reims journey thither, it is said, by night from the
famous forest of the Ardennes       the scene of Rosalind’s wanderings
and Touchstone’s eccentricities as set forth in As You Like It,
and whose gloomy depths and tangled glens shelter to-day not merely
boars but wolves as well.

In the Champagne it is no longer the fashion


“With javelin’s point a churlish swine to gore,”


nor to hunt the boar on horseback, as is still the case in Burgundy.
When the presence of one or more of these animals is signalled in the
neighbourhood, a      party starts off accompanied by dogs and armed
with double-barrelled rifles. A      circle having been formed round the
boar’s lair the dogs are set to draw him out, while the chasseurs
keep on the alert so as not to allow him to escape through their circle
alive. In this manner a few score of boars are killed every year in the
woods round about Reims and Epernay.









VINEYARDS OF AVIZE AND CRAMANT FROM THE GARDEN OF M. C. DE CAZANOVE.
(p.      135.)

The house of M. Charles de Cazanove was established in 1843 by its
present proprietor on the foundation of a business which had been in
existence since 1811. Compared with the monumental grandeur of some of
the great Reims and Epernay establishments the premises present a simple
and modest aspect, nevertheless they are capacious and commodious,
besides which the growing business of the house has led to the
acquisition of additional cellarage in other parts of Avize. More
important than all, however, is the quality of the wine with which these
cellars are stocked, and following the rule observed by champagne firms
of the highest repute, it has been a leading principle with M.      de
Cazanove always to rely upon the choicer growths       those
135

light, delicate, and fragrant wines of the Marne which throw out the
true aroma of the flower of the vine. M.      de Cazanove, who is
distinguished for his knowledge of viticulture, occupies an influential
position at Avize, being Vice-President of the Horticultural Society of
the Marne, and a member of the committee charged with guarding the
Champagne vineyards against the invasion of the phylloxera. His own
vines include only those fine varieties to which the crûs of the Marne
owe their great renown. He possesses an excellent vineyard at Grauves,
near Avize, and his mother-in-law, Madame Poultier, of Pierry, is one of
the principal vine-growers of the district.

M. de Cazanove’s wines are much appreciated in Paris, where his
business is very extensive. His shipments to England are also
considerable, but from the circumstance of some of his principal
customers importing the wine under special brands of their own, the
brand of the house is not so widely known as we should have
expected.

From M. de Cazanove’s terraced garden in the rear of his
establishment a fine view is obtained of one of the most famous
viticultural districts of the Champagne, yielding wines of remarkable
delicacy and exquisite bouquet. On the left hand rises up the mountain
of Avize, its summit fringed with dense woods, where in winter the wild
boar has his lair. In front stretch the long vine-clad slopes of
Cramant, with orchards at their base, and the housetops of the village
and the spire of the quaint old church just peeping over the brow of the
hill. To the right towers the bold forest-crowned height of Saran with
M.      Moët’s château perched half-way up its north-eastern slope, and
fading away in the hazy distance are the monotonous plains of the
Champagne.

We have already explained that the wines of Avize and Cramant rank as
premiers crûs of the white grape district, and that every
champagne manufacturer of repute mingles one or the other in his
cuvée. The white grapes are usually gathered a fortnight or three
weeks later than the black varieties, but in other respects the
vintaging of them is the same. The grapes
136

undergo the customary minute examination by the éplucheuses, and
all unripe, damaged, and rotten berries being thrown aside, the fruit is
conveyed with due care to the press-houses in the large baskets known as
paniers mannequins. The pressing takes place under exactly the
same conditions as the pressing of the black grapes; the must, too, is
drawn off into hogsheads to ferment, and by the end of the year, when
the active fermentation has terminated, the wine is usually clear and
limpid.

At Rilly-la-Montagne, on the line of railway between Reims and
Epernay, Roper frères       Cie., late of Epernay, now have their
establishment. Starting from the latter place we pass Ay and Avenay, and
then the little village of Germaine in the midst of the forest, and nigh
the summit of the mountain of Reims, with its “Rendezvous des Chasseurs”
in immediate proximity to the station. Finally we arrive at Rilly,
which, spite of its isolated situation, has about it that aspect of
prosperity common to the more favourable wine districts of France. This
is scarcely surprising when the quality of its wines is taken into
consideration. The still red wine of Rilly has long enjoyed a high local
reputation, and to-day the Rilly growths are much sought after for
conversion into champagne. White wine of 1874 from black grapes fetched,
we were informed, as much as from 600 to 700 francs the pièce, while the
finer qualities from white grapes realised from 300 to 400 francs.
Messrs. Roper frères       Cie. are the owners of some productive
vineyards situated on the high road to Chigny and Ludes.

The establishment of Roper frères is adjacent to a handsome modern
house standing back from the road in a large and pleasant garden,
bounded by vineyards on two of its sides. In the celliers all the
conveniences pertaining to a modern champagne establishment are to be
found, while extending beneath the garden are the extensive cellars of
the firm, comprising two stories of long and spacious galleries
excavated in the chalk, their walls and roofs being supported whenever
necessary by masonry. A      curious feature about these cellars is that
the roots of the larger trees in the garden above have penetrated
through
137

the roof of the upper story and hang pendent overhead like innumerable
stalactites. Here after the comparatively new wine of 1874 had been
shown to us       including samples of the Vin Brut or natural
champagne of which the firm make a speciality at a moderate
price       some choice old champagnes were brought forth, including the
fine vintages of 1865, 1857, and 1846. The latter wine had of course
preserved very little of its effervescence, still its flavour was
exceedingly fine, being soft and delicate to a degree. At the Vienna
Exhibition of 1873 and the London Exhibition of 1874 the collection of
champagnes exhibited by Roper frères met with favourable recognition
from the international juries.





Our tour through the Champagne vineyards and wine-cellars here comes
to an end. It is true there are important establishments at Châlons,
notably those of Jacquesson et fils, the Perriers, Freminet et fils, and
Jacquard frères, the cellars of the first-named being, perhaps,
unrivalled in the Champagne. As, however, any description of these
establishments would be little else than a recapitulation of something
we have already said, we content ourselves with merely notifying their
existence, and bring our Facts about Champagne to a close with the
translation of a poem from the pen of M.      Amaury de Cazanove of
Avize:       

CHAMPAGNE.


Less for thy grace and glory, land of
ours,

Than for thy dolour, dear;
Let the grief go, and here       

Here’s to thy skies, thy women and thy flowers!
France! take the toast, thy women and thy roses,

France! to thy wine, more wealth unto thy store!

And let the lips a grievous memory closes

Smile their proud smile once more!


Swarthy Falernian, Massica the Red,

Were ye the nectars poured
At the great gods’ broad board?

No, poor old wines, all but in name long dead,
Nectar’s Champagne, the sparkling soul of mirth,

That bubbling o’er with laughing gas,
Flashes gay sunbeams in the glass,

And like our flag goes proudly round the earth.

138



“I am the blood Burgundian sunshine makes;

A fine old feudal knight
Of bluff and boisterous might,

Whose casque feels       ah, so heavy when one wakes!”
“And I, the dainty Bordeaux, violets’

Perfume, and whose rare rubies gourmets prize.

My subtile savour gets

In partridge wings its daintiest allies.”


Ah, potent chiefs, Bordeaux and Burgundy.

If we must answer make,
This sober counsel take:

Messeigneurs, sing your worth less haughtily,
For ’tis Champagne, the sparkling soul of mirth,

That bubbling o’er with laughing gas,
Flashes gay sunbeams in the glass,

And like our flag goes proudly round the earth.


Aye, ’tis the true, the typic wine of France;

Aye, ’tis our heart that sparkles in our eyes,

And higher beats for every dire mischance;

It was the wit that made our fathers wise,

That made their valour gallant, gay,

When plumes were stirr’d by winds of waving swords,
And chivalry’s defiance spoke the words:

“À vous, Messieurs les Anglais, les premiers!”


Let the dull beer-apostle till he’s hoarse

Vent his small spleen and spite,
Fate fill his sleepless night

With nightmares of invincible remorse!
We sing Champagne, the sparkling soul of mirth,

That bubbling o’er with laughing gas,
Flashes gay sunbeams in the glass,

And like our flag goes proudly round the earth.

After
the Champagne Anjou is the French province which ranks next in
importance for its production of sparkling wines. Vintaged on the banks
of the Loire, these are largely consigned to the English and other
markets, labelled Crême de Bouzy, Sillery and Ay Mousseux, Cartes Noires
and Blanches, and the like, while their corks are branded with the names
of phantom firms, supposed to be located at Reims and Epernay. As a rule
these wines come from around Saumur, but they are not necessarily the
worse on that account, for the district produces capital sparkling
wines, the finer qualities of which improve greatly by being kept for a
few years. One curious thing shown to us at Saumur was the album of a
manufacturer of sparkling wines containing examples of the many hundred
labels ticketed with which his produce had for years past been sold. Not
one of these labels assigned to the wines the name of their real maker
or their true birthplace, but introduced them under the auspices of
mythical dukes and counts, as being manufactured at châteaux which are
so many “castles in Spain,” and as coming from Ay, Bouzy, Châlons,
Epernay, Reims, and Verzenay, but never by any chance from Saumur.









THE VINEYARDS OF THE COTEAU DE SAUMUR. (p. 141)

Being produced from robuster growths than the sparkling wines of the
Department of the Marne, sparkling saumur will always lack that
excessive lightness which is the crowning grace
141

of fine champagne, still it has only to be kept for a few years instead
of being drunk shortly after its arrival from the wine-merchant for its
quality to become greatly improved and its intrinsic value to be
considerably enhanced. We have drunk sparkling saumur that had been in
bottle for nearly twenty years, and found the wine not only remarkably
delicate, but, singular to say, with plenty of effervescence.

To an Englishman Anjou is one of the most interesting of the ancient
provinces of France. It was the cradle of the Plantagenet Kings, and
only ten miles from Saumur still repose the bones of Henry, the first
Plantagenet, and Richard of the Lion Heart, in the so-called Cimetière
des Rois of the historic abbey of Fontevrault. The famous vineyards of
the Coteau de Saumur, eastward of the town and bordering the Loire,
extend as far as here, and include the communes of Dampierre, Souzay,
Varrains, Chacé, Parnay, Turquant, and Montsoreau, the last-named within
three miles of Fontevrault, and chiefly remarkable through its seigneur
of ill-fame, Jean de Chambes, who instigated his wife to lure Boissy
d’Amboise to an assignation in order that he might more surely poignard
him. Saumur is picturesquely placed at the foot of this bold range of
heights near where the little river Thouet runs into the broad and rapid
Loire. A      massive-looking old château perched on the summit of an
isolated crag stands out grandly against the clear sky and dominates the
town, the older houses of which crouch at the foot of the lofty hill and
climb its steepest sides. The restored antique Hôtel de Ville, in the
pointed style, with its elegant windows, graceful belfry, and florid
wrought-iron balconies, stands back from the quay bordering the Loire.
In the rear is the Rue des Payens, whither the last of the Huguenots of
this “metropolis of Protestantism,” as it was formerly styled, retired,
converting their houses into so many fortresses to guard against being
surprised by their Catholic adversaries. Adjacent is the steep tortuous
Grande Rue, of which Balzac       himself a Tourangeau       has given
such a graphic picture in his Eugénie Grandet, the scene of which
is laid at Saumur. To-day, however,
142

only a few of its ancient carved timber houses, quaint overhanging
corner turrets, and fantastically-studded massive oak doors have escaped
demolition.

The vineyards of the Coteau de Saumur, yielding the finest wines, are
reached by the road skirting the river, the opposite low banks of which
are fringed with willows and endless rows of poplars, which at the time
of our visit were already golden with the fading tints of autumn.
Numerous fantastic windmills crown the heights, the summit of which is
covered with vines, varied by dense patches of woodland. Here, as
elsewhere along the banks of the Loire, the many abandoned quarries
along the face of the hill have been turned by the peasants into cosy
dwellings by simply walling-up the entrances while leaving, of course,
the necessary apertures for doors and windows. Dampierre, the first
village reached, has many of these cave-dwellings, and numbers of its
houses are picturesquely perched up the sides of the slope. The holiday
costumes of the peasant women encountered in the neighbourhood of Saumur
are exceedingly quaint, their elaborate and varied head-dresses being
counterparts of coiffures in vogue so far back as three and four
centuries ago.

Quitting the banks of the river, we ascend a steep tortuous road shut
in on either side by high stone walls       for hereabouts all the best
vineyards are scrupulously inclosed       and finally reach the summit
of the heights, whence a view is gained over what the Saumurois proudly
style the grand valley of the Loire. Everywhere around the vintage is
going on. The vines are planted rather more than a yard apart, and those
yielding black grapes are trained, as a rule, up tall stakes, although
some few are trained espalier fashion. Women dexterously detach the
bunches with pruning-knives and throw them into the
seilles       small squat buckets with wooden handles       the
contents of which are emptied from time to time into baskets       the
counterpart of the chiffonnier’s hotte, and coated with pitch
inside so as to close all the crevices of the wickerwork       which the
portes-bastes carry slung to their backs. When white wine is
being made from black
143

grapes for sparkling saumur the grapes are conveyed in these baskets
forthwith to the underground pressoirs in the neighbouring villages
before their skins get at all broken in order that the wine may be as
pale as possible in colour.

The black grape yielding the best wine in the Saumur district is the
breton, said to be the same as the carbinet-sauvignon, the leading
variety in the grand vineyards of the Médoc. Other species of black
grapes cultivated around Saumur are the varennes, yielding a soft and
insipid wine of no kind of value, and the liverdun, or large gamay, the
prevalent grape in the Mâconnais, and the same which in the days of
Philippe-le-Hardi the parlements of Metz and Dijon interdicted
the planting and cultivation of. The prevalent white grapes are the
large and small pineau blanc, the bunches of the former being of an
intermediate size, broad and pyramidal in shape, and with the berries
close together. These have fine skins, are oblong in shape, and of a
transparent yellowish-green hue tinged with red, are very sweet and
juicy, and as a rule ripen late. As for the small pineau, the bunches
are less compact, the berries are round and of a golden tint, are finer
as well as sweeter in flavour, and ripen somewhat earlier than the fruit
of the larger variety.

We noticed as we drove through the villages of Champigny and
Varrains       the former celebrated for its fine red wines, and more
especially its crû of the Clos des Cordeliers       that hardly any of
the houses had windows looking on to the narrow street, but that all
were provided with low openings for shooting the grapes into the cellar
where, when making red wine, they are trodden, but when making white
wine, whether from black or white grapes, they are invariably pressed.
Each of the houses had its ponderous porte-cochère and low narrow portal
leading into the large inclosed yard at its side, and over the high
blank walls vines were frequently trained and pleasantly varied their
dull grey monotony.

The grapes on being shot into the openings just mentioned fall
through a kind of tunnel into a reservoir adjacent to the heavy press,
which is invariably of wood and of the old-fashioned
144

cumbersome type. They are forthwith placed beneath the press and usually
subjected to five separate squeezes, the must from the first three being
reserved for sparkling wine, while that from the two latter, owing to
its being more or less deeply tinted, only serves for table wine. The
must is at once run off into casks in order that it may not ferment on
the grape-skins and imbibe any portion of their colouring matter. Active
fermentation speedily sets in and lasts for a fortnight or three weeks
according to whether the temperature chances to be high or low.

The vintaging of the white grapes takes place about a fortnight later
than the black grapes, and is commonly a compound operation, the best
and ripest bunches being first of all gathered just as the berries begin
to get shrivelled and show symptoms of approaching rottenness. It is
these selected grapes that yield the best wine. The second gathering,
which follows shortly after the first, includes all the grapes remaining
on the vines, and yields a wine perceptibly inferior in quality. The
grapes on their arrival at the press-house are generally pressed
immediately and the must is run off into tuns to ferment. At the
commencement these tuns are filled up every three or four days to
replace the fermenting must which has flowed over; afterwards any waste
is made good at the interval of a week, and then once a fortnight, the
bungholes of the casks being securely closed towards the end of the
year, by which time the first fermentation is over.

It should be noted that the Saumur sparkling wine manufacturers draw
considerable supplies of the white wine required to impart lightness and
effervescence to their vin préparé from the Vouvray vineyards.
Vouvray borders the Loire a few miles from the pleasant city of Tours,
which awakens sinister recollections of truculent Louis XI., shut up in
his fortified castle of Plessis-lez-Tours, around which Scott has thrown
the halo of his genius in his novel of Quentin Durward. On
proceeding to Vouvray from Tours we skirt a succession of poplar-fringed
meadows stretching eastward in the direction of Amboise along
145

the right bank of the Loire; and after a time a curve in the river
discloses to view a range of vine-clad heights extending some distance
beyond the village of Vouvray. Our route lies past the picturesque ruins
of the abbey of Marmoûtier and the Château des Roches       one of the
most celebrated castles of the Loire       the numerous excavations in
the soft limestone ridge on which they are perched being converted as
usual into houses, magazines, and wine-cellars. We proceed through the
village of Rochecorbon, and along a road winding among the spurs of the
Vouvray range, past hamlets, half of whose inhabitants live in these
primitive dwellings hollowed out of the cliff, and finally enter the
charming Vallée Coquette, hemmed in on all sides with vine-clad slopes.
Here a picturesque old house, half château half homestead, was pointed
out to us as a favourite place of sojourn of Balzac, who speaks of this
rocky ridge as “inhabited by a population of vine-dressers, their houses
of several stories being hollowed out in the face of the cliff, and
connected by dangerous staircases hewn in the soft stone. Smoke curls
from most of the chimneys which peep above the green crest of vines,
while the blows of the cooper’s hammer resound in several of the
cellars. A      young girl trips to her garden over the roofs of these
primitive dwellings, and an old woman, tranquilly seated on a ledge of
projecting rock, supported solely by the thick straggling roots of the
ivy which spreads itself over the disjointed stones, leisurely turns her
spinning-wheel regardless of her dangerous position.” The picture
sketched by the author of La Comédie Humaine, some forty years
ago, has scarcely changed at the present day.

At the point where the village of Vouvray climbs half-way up the
vine-crested ridge the rapid-winding Cise throws itself into the Loire,
and on crossing the bridge that spans the tributary stream we discern on
the western horizon, far beyond the verdant islets studding the swollen
Loire, the tall campaniles of Tours Cathedral, which seem to rise out of
the water like a couple of Venetian towers. Vouvray is a trim little
place, clustered round about with numerous pleasant villas in the midst
of charming gardens. The modern château of Moncontour here
146

dominates the slope, and its terraced gardens, with, their
fantastically-clipped trees and geometric parterres, rise tier above
tier up the face of the picturesque height that overlooks the broad
fertile valley, with its gardens, cultivated fields, patches of
woodland, and wide stretches of green pasture which, fringed with
willows and poplars, border the swollen waters of the Loire. Where the
river Brenne empties itself into the Cise the Coteau de Vouvray slopes
off towards the north, and there rise up the vine-clad heights of
Vernou, yielding a similar but inferior wine to that of Vouvray. The
village of Vernou is nestled under the hill, and near the porch of its
quaint little church a venerable elm tree is pointed out as having been
planted by Sully, Henry IV.’s able Minister. Here, too, an ancient wall,
pierced with curious arched windows, and forming part of a modern
building, is regarded by popular tradition as belonging to the palace in
which Pépin-le-Bref, father of Charlemagne, lived at Vernou.

The communes of Dampierre, Souzay, and Parnay, in the neighbourhood
of Saumur, produce still red wines rivalling those of Champigny, besides
which all the finest white wines are vintaged hereabouts       in the
Perrière, the Poilleux, and the Clos Morain vineyards, and in the
Rotissans vineyard at Turquant. Wines of very fair quality are also
grown on the more favourable slopes extending southwards along the
valley of the Thouet, and comprised in the communes of Varrains, Chacé,
St. Cyr-en-Bourg, and Brézé. The whole of this district, by the way,
abounds with interesting archæological remains. While visiting the
vineyards of Varrains and Chacé we came upon a couple of
dolmens       vestiges of the ancient Celtic population of the valley of
the Loire singularly abundant hereabouts. Brézé, the marquisate of which
formerly belonged to Louis XVI.’s famous grand master of the
ceremonies       immortalized by the rebuff he received from
Mirabeau       boasts a noble château on the site of an ancient
fortress, in connection with which there are contemporary excavations in
the neighbouring limestone, designed for a garrison of 500 or 600 men.
Beyond the vineyards of Saint-Florent, westward of Saumur and on the
banks
147

of the Thouet, is an extensive plateau partially overgrown with vines,
where may be traced the remains of a Roman camp. Moreover, in the
southern environs of Saumur, in the midst of vineyards producing
exclusively white wines, is one of the most remarkable dolmens known.
This imposing structure, perfect in all respects save that one of the
four enormous stones which roof it in has been split in two, and
requires to be supported, is no less than 65 feet in length, 23 feet in
width, and 10 feet high.






DOLMEN AT BAGNEUX, NEAR SAUMUR.

At Saint-Florent, the pleasant little suburb of Saumur, skirting the
river Thouet, and sheltered by steep hills formed of soft limestone,
offering great facilities for the excavation of extensive cellars, the
largest manufacturer of Saumur sparkling wines has his establishment.
Externally this offers but little to strike the eye. A      couple of
pleasant country houses, half hidden by spreading foliage, stand at the
two extremities of a spacious and well-kept garden, beyond which one
catches a glimpse of some outbuildings sheltered by the vine-crowned
cliff, in which a labyrinth of gloomy galleries has been hollowed out.
Here
148

M.      Ackerman-Laurance, the extent of whose business ranks him as
second among the sparkling wine manufacturers of the world, stores
something like 10,000 casks and several million bottles of wine.

At the commencement of the present century, in the days when, as
Balzac relates in his Eugénie Grandet, the Belgians bought up
entire vintages of Saumur wine, then largely in demand with them for
sacramental purposes, the founder of the Saint-Florent house commenced
to deal in the ordinary still wines of the district. Nearly half a
century ago he was led to attempt the manufacture of sparkling wines,
but his efforts to bring them into notice failed, and he was on the
point of abandoning his enterprise when an order for one hundred cases
revived his hopes, and led to the foundation of the present vast
establishment. As already mentioned, for many miles all the heights
along the Loire have been more or less excavated for stone for building
purposes, so that every one hereabouts who grows wine or deals in it has
any amount of cellar accommodation ready to hand. It was the vast extent
of the galleries which M.      Ackerman père discovered already
excavated at Saint-Florent that induced him to settle there in
preference to Saumur. Extensive, however, as the original vaults were,
considerable additional excavations have from time to time been found
necessary; and to-day the firm is still further increasing the area of
its cellars, which already comprise three principal avenues, each the
third of a mile long, and no fewer than sixty transverse galleries, the
total length of which is several miles. One great advantage is that the
whole are on the ordinary level.

Ranged against the black uneven walls of the more tortuous ancient
vaults which give access to these labyrinthine corridors are thousands
of casks of wine       some in single rows, others in triple
tiers       forming the reserve stock of the establishment. As may be
supposed, a      powerful vinous odour permeates these vaults, in which
the fumes of wine have been accumulating for the best part of a century.
After passing beneath a massive stone arch which separates the old
cellars from the new, a      series of
149

broad and regularly-proportioned galleries are reached, having bottles
stacked in their tens of thousands on either side. Overhead the roof is
perforated at regular intervals with circular shafts, affording both
light and ventilation, and enabling the temperature to be regulated to a
nicety. In these lateral and transverse galleries millions of bottles of
wine in various stages of preparation are stacked.









THE CELLARS OF M. ACKERMAN-LAURANCE AT SAINT-FLORENT.
LABELLING AND PACKING SPARKLING SAUMUR.<ins
class = "mycorr" title = "parenthesis missing"> (p.
150.)

We have explained that in the Champagne it is the custom for the
manufacturers of sparkling wine to purchase considerable quantities of
grapes from the surrounding growers, and to press these themselves, or
have them pressed under their own superintendence. At Saumur only those
firms possessing vineyards make their own vin brut, the bulk of
the wine used for conversion into sparkling wine being purchased from
the neighbouring growers. On the newly-expressed must arriving at
M.      Ackerman-Laurance’s cellars it is allowed to rest until the
commencement of the ensuing year, when half of it is mixed with wine in
stock belonging to last year’s vintage, and the remaining half is
reserved for mingling with the must of the ensuing vintage. The blending
is accomplished in a couple of colossal vats hewn out of the rock, and
coated on the inside with cement. Each of these vats is provided with
200 paddles for thoroughly mixing the wine, and with five pipes for
drawing it off when the amalgamation is complete. Usually the
cuvée will embrace 1,600 hogsheads, or 80,000 gallons of wine,
almost sufficient for half a million bottles. A      fourth of this
quantity can be mixed in each vat at a single operation, and this mixing
is repeated again and again until the last gallon run off is of
precisely the same type as the first. For the finer qualities of
sparkling saumur the proportion of wine from the black grapes to that
from white is generally at the rate of three or four to one. For the
inferior qualities more wine from white than from black grapes is
invariably used. Only in the wine from white grapes is the effervescent
principle retained to any particular extent; but, on the other hand, the
wine from black grapes imparts both quality and vinous character to the
blend.

150

The blending having been satisfactorily accomplished, the wine is stored
in casks, never perfectly filled, yet with their bungholes tightly
closed, and slowly continues its fermentation, eating up its sugar,
purging itself, and letting fall its lees. Three months later it is
fined. It is rarely kept in the wood for more than a year, though
sometimes the superior qualities remain for a couple of years in cask.
Occasionally it is even bottled in the spring following the vintage;
still, as a rule, the bottling of sparkling saumur takes place during
the ensuing summer months, when the temperature is at the highest as
this insures to it a greater degree of effervescence. At the time of
bottling its saccharine strength is raised to a given degree by the
addition of the finest sugar-candy, and henceforward the wine is
subjected to precisely the same treatment as is pursued with regard to
champagne.

It is in a broad but sombre gallery of the more ancient
vaults       the roughly-hewn walls of which are black from the combined

disgorging the wine of its sediment, adding the syrup, filling up the

impart very little light, but a couple of resplendent metal reflectors,
which at a distance one might fancy to be some dragon’s flaming eyes,
combined with the lamps placed near the people at work, effectually
illuminate the spot.






THE CELLARS OF M. LOUIS DUVAU AÎNÉ AT THE CHÂTEAU OF VARRAINS.

Another considerable manufacturer of sparkling saumur is
M.      Louis Duvau aîné, owner of the château of Varrains, in the
village of the same name, at no great distance from the Coteau de
Saumur. His cellars adjoin the château, a      picturesque but somewhat
neglected structure of the last century, with sculptured medallions in
high relief above the lower windows, and florid vases surmounting the
mansards in the roof. In front is a large rambling court shaded with
acacia and lime trees, and surrounded by outbuildings, prominent among
which is a picturesque
151

dovecote, massive at the base as a martello tower, and having an elegant
open stone lantern springing from its bell-shaped roof. The cellars are
entered down a steep incline under a low stone arch, the masonry above
which is overgrown with ivy in large clusters and straggling creeping
plants. We soon come upon a deep recess to the right, wherein stands a
unique cumbersome screw-press, needing ten or a dozen men to work the
unwieldy capstan which sets the juice flowing from the crushed grapes
into the adjacent shallow trough. On our left hand are a couple of
ancient reservoirs, formed out of huge blocks of stone, with the
entrance to a long vaulted cellar filled with wine in cask. We advance
slowly in the uncertain light along a succession of gloomy galleries
with moisture oozing from their blackened walls and roofs, picking our
way between bottles of wine stacked in huge square piles and rows of
casks ranged in tiers. Suddenly a broad flood of light shooting down a
lofty shaft throws a Rembrandtish effect across a spacious and most
melodramatic-looking cave, roughly hewn out of the rock, and
152

towards which seven dimly-lighted galleries converge. On all sides a
scene of bustling animation presents itself. From one gallery men keep
arriving with baskets of wine ready for the disgorger; while along
another bottles of wine duly dosed with syrup are being borne off to be
decorated with metal foil and their distinctive labels. Groups of
workmen are busily engaged disgorging, dosing, and re-corking the
newly-arrived bottles of wine; corks fly out with a succession of loud
reports suggestive of the irregular fire of a party of skirmishers;
a      fizzing, spurting, and spluttering of the wine next ensues, and
is followed by the incessant clicking of the various apparatus employed
in the corking and wiring of the bottles.

Gradual inclines conduct to the two lower tiers of galleries, for the
cellars of M.      Duvau consist of as many as three stories. Down below
there is naturally less light, and the temperature, too, is sensibly
colder. Advantage is taken of this latter circumstance to remove the
newly-bottled wine to these lower vaults whenever an excessive
development of carbonic acid threatens the bursting of an undue
proportion of bottles, a      casualty which among the Saumur sparkling
wine manufacturers ranges far higher than with the manufacturers of
champagne. For the economy of time and labour a lift, raised and lowered
by means of a capstan worked by horses, is employed to transfer the
bottles of wine from one tier of cellars to another.

The demand for sparkling saumur is evidently on the increase, for
M.      Duvau, at the time of our visit, was excavating extensive
additional cellarage. The subsoil at Varrains being largely composed of
marl, which is much softer than the tufa of the Saint-Florent coteau,
necessitated the roofs of the new galleries being worked in a particular
form in order to avoid having recourse to either brickwork or masonry.
Tons of this excavated marl were being spread over the soil of
M.      Duvau’s vineyard in the rear of the château, greatly, it was
said, to the benefit of the vines, whose grapes were all of the black
variety; indeed, scarcely any wine is vintaged from white grapes in the
commune of Varrains.

153

At M. Duvau’s we went through a complete scale of sparkling saumurs,
commencing with the younger and less matured samples, and ascending step
by step to wines a dozen and more years old. Every year seemed to
produce an improvement in the wine, the older varieties gaining greatly
in delicacy and softening very perceptibly in flavour.

Another sparkling saumur manufacturer of note is M. Alfred Rousteaux,
to-day the sole proprietor of the well-known brand of Morlet and
Rousteaux, a      firm established for many years at Saint-Florent.
M.      Rousteaux’s cellars here are excavated in the tufa cliff which
rises behind the little suburban village, and are all on one level. The
galleries, though somewhat winding and irregular, are broad and roomy,
and in them about 400,000 bottles of wine undergoing the necessary
treatment are piled up in stacks or placed sur pointe. The
original firm had only been in existence a few years when they found
that their Saint-Florent establishment was inadequate to the
requirements of a largely-increasing business, and they started the
branch establishment of La Perrière at Saint-Cyr, near Tours, but on the
opposite bank of the Loire. Here are a handsome residence and gardens,
a      spacious court, and convenient celliers where the bottling of the
wine is effected, together with extensive and well-constructed cellars
in which a like quantity of wine to that contained in the cellars at
Saint-Florent is stored. With his finer sparkling wines
M.      Rousteaux mixes a certain proportion of wine from the Champagne
district, and thus secures a degree of lightness unattainable when the
cuvée is exclusively composed of Saumur vintages. At La Perrière
M.      Rousteaux has a vineyard of upwards of sixty acres, yielding the
best wine of the district, which is noted, by the way, for its excellent
growths. Hereabouts a succession of vineyard slopes stretch from one to
another of the many historic châteaux along this portion of the Loire,
the romantic associations of which render the Touraine one of the most
interesting provinces of France. Near Tours besides the vineyards of
Saint-Cyr are those of Joué and Saint-Avertin; the two last situate on
the opposite
154

bank of the Cher, where the little town of Joué, perched on the summit
of a hill in the midst of vineyards, looks over a vast plain known by
the country people as the Landes de Charlemagne, the scene, according to
local tradition, of Charles Martel’s great victory over the Saracens.
The Saint-Avertin vineyards extend towards the east, stretching almost
to the forest of Larçay, on the borders of the Cher, where Paul Louis
Courier, the famous vigneron pamphleteer of the Restoration, noted alike
for his raillery, wit, and satire, fell beneath the balls of an
assassin. A      noticeable crû in the neighbourhood of Tours is that of
Cinq Mars, the ruined château of which survives as a memorial of the
vengeance of Cardinal Richelieu, who, after having sent its owner to the
scaffold, commanded its massive walls and towers to be razed “à
hauteur d’infamie” as we see them now.

Finding that sparkling wines were being made in most of the
wine-producing districts of France, where the growths were sufficiently
light and of the requisite quality, Messrs. E.      Normandin and Co.
conceived the idea of laying the famous Bordeaux district under
contribution for a similar purpose, and, aided by a staff of experienced
workmen from Epernay, they have succeeded in producing a sparkling
sauternes. Sauternes, as is well known, is one of the finest of white
wines, soft, delicate, and of beautiful flavour, and its transformation
into a sparkling wine has been very successfully accomplished. Messrs.
Normandin’s head-quarters are in the thriving little town of
Châteauneuf, in the pleasant valley of the Charente, and within fifteen
miles of Angoulême, a      famous old French town, encompassed by
ancient ramparts and crumbling corner towers, and which, dominated by
the lofty belfry of its restored semi-Byzantine cathedral, rising in a
series of open arcades, spreads itself picturesquely out along a
precipitous height, watered at its base by the rivers Anguienne and
Charente. Between Angoulême and Châteauneuf vineyard plots dotted over
with walnut trees, or simple rows of vines divided by strips of ripening
maize, and broken up at intervals by bright green pastures, line both
banks of the river Charente. The surrounding country is
155

undulating and picturesque. Poplars and elms fringe the roadsides,
divide the larger fields and vineyards, and screen the cosy-looking
red-roofed farmhouses, which present to the eyes of the passing tourist
a succession of pictures of quiet rural prosperity.





Châteauneuf communicates with the Sauternes district by rail, so that
supplies of wine from there are readily obtainable. Vin de
Colombar       a      famous white growth which English and Dutch
cruisers used to ascend the Charente to obtain cargoes of when the Jerez
wines were shut out from England by the Spanish War of
Succession       vintaged principally at Montignac-le-Coq, also enters
largely into Messrs. Normandin and Co.’s sparkling sauternes
cuvée. This colombar grape is simply the semillon       one of
the leading varieties of the Sauternes district       transported to the
Charente. The remarkably cool cellars
156

where the firm store their wine, whether in wood or bottle, have been
formed from some vast subterranean galleries whence centuries ago stone
was quarried, and which are situated about a quarter of an hour’s drive
from Châteauneuf, in the midst of vineyards and cornfields. The wine is
invariably bottled in a cellier at the head establishment, but it is in
these cellars where it goes through the course of careful treatment
similar to that pursued with regard to champagne.





In order that the delicate flavour of the wine may be preserved the
liqueur is prepared with the finest old sauternes, without any addition
of spirit, and the dose is administered with the most improved modern
appliance, constructed of silver, and provided with crystal taps. At the
Concours Régional d’Angoulême of 1877, the jury, after recording that
they had satisfied themselves by the aid of a chemical analysis that the
samples of sparkling sauternes submitted to their judgment were free
from any foreign ingredient, awarded to Messrs. Normandin and Co. the
only gold medal given in the Group of Alimentary Products.

Encouraged, no doubt, by the success obtained by Messrs. Normandin
and Co. with their sparkling sauternes, the house of Lermat-Robert and
Co., of Bordeaux, have recently introduced a sparkling barsac, samples
of which were submitted to the jury at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.

Jura Wines       Their Vintaging and Subsequent Treatment       Their
High Alcoholic Strength and General Drawbacks.


Sparkling
wines are made to a considerable extent in Burgundy, notably at Beaune,
Nuits, and Dijon, and though as a
158

rule heavier and more potent than the subtile and delicate-flavoured
wines of the Marne, still some of the higher qualities, both of the red
and white varieties, exhibit a degree of refinement which those familiar
only with the commoner kinds can scarcely form an idea of. At the Paris
Exhibition of 1878 we tasted, among a large collection of the sparkling
wines of the Côte d’Or, samples of Chambertin, Romanée, and Vougeot of
the highest order. Although red wines, they had the merit of being
deficient in that body which forms such an objectionable feature in
sparkling wines of a deep shade of colour. M.      Regnier, the
exhibitor of sparkling red vougeot, sent, moreover, a      white
sparkling wine from the species of grape known locally as the clos blanc
de Vougeot. These wines, as well as the Chambertin, came from the Côte
de Nuits, the growths of which are generally considered of too vigorous
a type for successful conversion into sparkling wine, preference being
usually given to the produce of the Côte de Beaune. Among the sparkling
burgundies from the last-named district were samples from Savigny,
Chassagne, and Meursault, all famous for their fine white wines.





Burgundy ranks as one of the oldest viticultural regions of Central
Europe, and for centuries its wines have been held in the highest
renown. In the Middle Ages both the wines and vines of this favoured
province passed as presents from one royal personage to another, just as
grand cordons are exchanged between them now-a-days. The
fabrication of sparkling wine, however, dates no further back than some
sixty years or so. The system of procedure is much the same as in the
Champagne, and, as there, the wine is mainly the produce of the pineau
noir and pineau blanc varieties of grape. At the vintage, in order to
avoid bruising the ripened fruit and to guard against premature
fermentation, the grapes are conveyed to the pressoirs in baskets
instead of the large oval vats termed balonges, common to the
district. They are placed beneath the press as soon as possible, and for
superior sparkling wines only the juice resulting from the first
pressure and known as the mère goutte, or mother drop, is
employed. For the ordinary
159

wines that expressed at the second squeezing of the fruit is mingled
with the other. The must is at once run off into casks which have been
previously sulphured to check, in a measure, the ardour of the first
fermentation and lighten the colour of the newly-made wine. Towards the
end of October, when this first fermentation is over, the wine is
removed to the cellars, or to some other cool place, and in December it
is racked into other casks. In the April following it is again racked to
insure its being perfectly clear at the epoch of bottling in the month
of May. The sulphuring of the original casks having had the effect of
slightly checking the fermentation and retaining a certain amount of
saccharine in the wine, it is only on exceptional occasions that the
latter is artificially sweetened previous to being bottled.

A fortnight after the tirage the wine commonly attains the stage
known as grand mousseux, and by the end of September the breakage
will have amounted to between 5 and 8 per cent., which necessitates the
taking down the stacks of bottles and piling them up anew. The wine as a
rule remains in the cellars for fully a couple of years from the time of
bottling until it is shipped. Posing the bottles sur pointe,
agitating them daily, together with the disgorging and liqueuring of the
wine, is accomplished precisely as in the Champagne.

Among the principal manufacturers of sparkling burgundies are Messrs.
André and Voillot, of Beaune, whose sparkling white Romanée, Nuits, and
Volnay are well and favourably known in England; M.      Louis Latour,
also of Beaune, and equally noted for his sparkling red Volnay, Nuits,
and Chambertin, as for his
160

sparkling white varieties; Messrs. Maire et fils, likewise of Beaune;
M.      Labouré-Goutard and Messrs. Geisweiller et fils, of Nuits;
Messrs. Marey and Liger-Belair, of Nuits and Vôsne; and M.      Regnier,
of Dijon.

In the department of the Yonne       that is, in Lower
Burgundy       sparkling wines somewhat alcoholic in character have been
made for the last half-century at Tonnerre, where the Chevalier d’Eon,
that enigma of his epoch, was born. The Tonnerre vineyards are of high
antiquity, and for sparkling wines the produce of the black and white
pineau and the white morillon varieties of grape is had recourse to. The
vintaging is accomplished with great care, and only the juice which
flows from the first pressure is employed. This is run off immediately
into casks which are hermetically closed when the fermentation has
subsided. The after-treatment of the wine is the same as in the
Champagne. Sparkling wines are likewise made at Epineuil, a      village
in the neighbourhood of Tonnerre, and at Chablis, so famous for its
white wines, about ten miles distant.

An effervescing wine known as the Vin d’Arbanne is made at
Bar-sur-Aube, some fifty miles north-east of Tonnerre, on the borders of
Burgundy, but actually in the province of Champagne, although far beyond
the limits to which the famed viticultural district extends. It was at
Bar-sur-Aube where the Bastard de Bourbon, chief of the sanguinary gang
of écorcheurs (flayers), was sewn up in a sack and flung over the
parapet of the old stone bridge into the river beneath by order of
Charles VII.; and here, too, Madame de la Motte, of Diamond Necklace
notoriety, was married, and in after years made a parade of the
ill-gotten wealth she had acquired by successfully fooling that
infatuated libertine the Cardinal Prince de Rohan, until her
ostentatious display was cut short by her arrest. This Vin d’Arbanne is
produced from pineaux and white gamay grapes, which, after being
gathered with care at the moment the dew falls, are forthwith pressed.
The wine is left on its lees until the following February, when it is
racked and fined, the bottling taking place when the moon is at the full
in March.

161

Red and white sparkling wines are made to a small extent at Saint-Lager,
in the Beaujolais, from wine vintaged in the Mont-Brouilly vineyards,
one of the best known of the Beaujolais crûs. Mont-Brouilly is a lofty
hill near the village of Cercie, and is covered from base to summit on
all its sides with vines of the gamay species, rarely trained at all,
but left to trail along the ground at their own sweet will. At the
vintage, as we witnessed it, men and women       young, middle-aged, and
old       accompanied by troops of children, were roaming all over the
slopes dexterously nipping off the bunches of grapes with their thumb
and finger nails and flinging them into the little wooden tubs with
which they were provided. The pressing of the grapes and the
after-treatment of the wine destined to become sparkling are the same in
the Beaujolais as in Upper and Lower Burgundy.

The red, straw, and yellow wines of the Jura have long had a high
reputation in the East of France, and the vin jaune of Arbois, an
ancient fortified town on the banks of the Cuisance, besieged and sacked
in turn by Charles of Amboise, Henri IV., and Louis XIV., was one of the
favourite beverages of the tippling Béarnais who styled himself Seigneur
of Ay and Gonesse, and who acquired his liking for it while sojourning
during the siege of Arbois at the old Château des Arsures. In one of
Henri Quatre’s letters to his minister Sully we find him observing,
“I      send you two bottles of Vin d’Arbois, for I know you do not
detest it.” A      couple of other bottles of the same wine are said to
have cemented the king’s reconciliation with Mayenne, the leader of the
League, and the lover of La Belle Gabrielle is moreover credited with
having composed at his mistress’s table some <ins class = "mycorr" title
= "spelling unchanged">doggrel rhymes in honour of the famous Jura
crû:       


“Come, little page, serve us aright,

The crown is often heavy to bear;

So fill up my goblet large and light

Whenever you find a vacancy there.

This wine is surely no Christian wight,

And yet you never complaint will hear
That it’s not baptised with water clear.

162

Down my throat I pour
The old Arbois;

And now, my lords, let us our voices raise,
And sing of Silenus and Bacchus the praise!”

In more modern times the Jura, not content with the fame of the
historic yellow wines of Arbois and the deservedly-esteemed straw wines
of Château-Châlon, has produced large quantities of sparkling wine, the
original manufacture of which commenced as far back as a century ago.
To-day the principal seats of the manufacture are at Arbois and
Lons-le-Saulnier, the latter town the capital of the department and one
of the most ancient towns of France. Originally founded by the Gauls on
the banks of the Vallière, in a little valley bordered by lofty hills,
which are to-day covered with vines, it was girded round with
fortifications by the Romans. Subsequently the Huns and the Vandals
pillaged it; then the French and the Burgundians repeatedly contested
its possession, and it was only definitively acquired by France during
the reign of Louis XIV. Rouget de l’Isle, the famous author of the
“Marseillaise,” was born at Lons-le-Saulnier, and here also Marshal Ney
assembled and harangued his troops before marching to join Napoleon,
whom he had promised Louis XVIII. to bring back to Paris in an iron
cage.

The vineyards whence the principal supplies for these sparkling wines
are derived are grouped at varying distances around Lons-le-Saulnier at
L’Etoile, Quintigny, Salins, Arbois, St. Laurent-la-Roche, and Pupillin,
with the Jura chain of mountains rising up grandly on the east. The best
vineyards at L’Etoile       which lies some couple of miles from
Lons-le-Saulnier, surrounded by hills, planted from base to summit with
vines       are La Vigne Blanche, Montmorin, and Montgenest. At
Quintigny, the wines of which are less potent than those of Arbois, and
only retain their effervescent properties for a couple of years, the
Paridis, Prémelan, and Montmorin vineyards are held in most repute,
while at Pupillin, where a soft agreeable wine is vintaged, the
principal vineyards are the Faille and the Clos. The vine cultivated for
the production of sparkling wines are chiefly the
163

savagnin, or white pineau, the melon of Poligny, and the poulsard,
a      black variety of grape held locally in much esteem.





At the vintage, which commences towards the end of October and lasts
until the middle of the following month, all the rotten or unripe grapes
are carefully set aside and the sound ones only submitted to the action
of a screw-press. After the must has flowed for about half-an-hour the
grapes are newly collected under the press and the screw again applied.
The produce of this double operation is poured into a vat termed a
sapine, where it remains until bubbles are seen escaping through
the chapeau that forms on the surface of the liquid. The must is
then drawn off       sometimes after being fined       into casks, which
the majority of wine-growers previously impregnate with the fumes of
sulphur. When in cask the wine is treated in one of two ways; either the
casks are kept constantly filled to the bunghole, causing the foam which
rises to the surface during the fermentation to flow over, and thereby
leave the wine comparatively clear, or else the casks are not completely
filled, in which case the wine requires to be racked several times
before it is in a condition for fining. This latter operation is
effected about the commencement of February, and a second fining follows
if the first one fails to render the wine perfectly clear. At the
tirage, which invariably takes place in
164

April, the Jura wines rarely require any addition of sugar to insure an
ample effervescence. After bottling they are treated in exactly the same
manner as the vintages of the Marne are treated by the great champagne
manufacturers. In addition to white sparkling wine a pink variety, with
natural effervescent properties, is made by mixing with the savagnin and
melon grapes a certain proportion of the poulsard species, from which
the best red wines of the Jura are produced.

One of the principal sparkling wine establishments at
Lons-le-Saulnier is that of M.      Auguste Devaux, founded in the year
1860. He manufactures both sweet and dry wines, which are sold largely
in France and elsewhere on the Continent, and have lately been
introduced into England. Their alcoholic strength is equivalent to from
25° to 26° of proof spirit, being largely above the dry sparkling wines
of the Champagne, which the Jura manufacturers regard as a positive
advantage rather than an obvious drawback. M.      Devaux’s principal
brand is the Fleur de l’Etoile, of which, he has white, pink, and
amber-coloured varieties, quoted by him at merely three francs the
bottle for the grand years.

Besides being too spirituous, the sparkling wines of the Jura are
deficient in refinement and delicacy. The commoner kinds, indeed,
frequently have a pronounced unpleasant flavour, due to the nature of
the soil, to careless vinification, or to the inferior quality of
liqueur with which the wines have been dosed. Out of some fifty samples
of all ages and varieties which in my capacity of juror I tasted at the
Paris Exhibition I cannot call to mind one that a real connoisseur of
sparkling wines would care to admit to his table.

Water       Blanquette of Limoux and How it is
Made       Characteristics of this Overrated Wine.


Sparkling
wines are made after a fashion in several of the southern provinces of
France       in Auvergne, at Clermont-Ferrand, under the shadow of the
lofty Puy de Dôme; in Guienne, at Astaffort, the scene of a bloody
engagement during the
166

Wars of Religion in which the Protestant army was cut to pieces when
about to cross the Garonne; at Nérac, where frail Marguerite de Valois
kept her dissolute Court, and Catherine de Médicis brought her flying
squadron of fascinating maids of honour to gain over the Huguenot
leaders to the Catholic cause; and at Cahors, the Divina, or divine
fountain of the Celts, and the birthplace of Pope John XXII., of Clement
Marot, the early French poet, and of Léon Gambetta; in Dauphiné, at Die,
Saint-Chef, Saint-Péray, and Largentière, so named after some abandoned
silver mines, and where the vines are cultivated against low walls
rising in a series of terraces from the base to the summit of the lofty
hills; and in Languedoc, at Brioude, where St. Vincent, the patron saint
of the vinedressers, suffered martyrdom, and where it is the practice to
expose the must of the future sparkling wine for several nights to the
dew in order to rid it of its reddish colour; also at Linardie, and,
more southward still, at Limoux, whence comes the well-known
effervescing Blanquette.

Principal among the foregoing is the excellent wine of Saint-Péray,
commonly characterised as the champagne of the South of France. The
Saint-Péray vineyards border the Rhône some ten miles below the
Hermitage coteau       the vines of which are to-day well-nigh destroyed
by the phylloxera       but are on the opposite bank of the river. Our
visit to Saint-Péray was made from Valence, in which dull southern city
we had loitered in order to glance at the vast Hôtel du
Gouvernement       where octogenarian Pius VI., after being spirited
away a prisoner from Rome and hurried over the Alps in a litter by order
of the French Directory, drew his last breath while silently gazing
across the rushing river at the view he so much admired       and to
discover the house in the Grande Rue, numbered      4, in an attic of
which history records that Napoleon      I., when a sub-lieutenant of
artillery in garrison at Valence, resided, and which he quitted owing
three and a-half francs to his pastrycook.

We crossed the Rhône over one of its hundred flimsy suspension
bridges, on the majority of which a notice warns you
167

neither to smoke nor run, and were soon skirting the base of a lofty,
bare, precipitous rock, with the “horns of Crussol,” as the peasants
term two tall pointed gables of a ruined feudal château, perched at the
dizzy edge, and having a perpendicular fall of some five or six hundred
feet below. The château, which formerly belonged to the Dukes of Uzès,
recognised by virtue of the extent of their domains as premiers pairs
de France, was not originally erected in close proximity to any such
formidable precipice. The crag on which it stands had, it seems, been
blasted from time to time for the sake of the stone, until on one
unlucky occasion when too heavy a charge of powder was employed, the
entire side of the rock, together with a considerable portion of the
château itself, were sent flying into the air. The authorities,
professing to regard what remained of the edifice as an historical
monument of the Middle Ages, hereupon stepped in and prohibited the
quarry being worked for the future.

Passing beneath the cliff, one wound round to the left and dived into
a picturesque wooded dell at the entrance to a mountain pass, then
crossed the rocky bed of a dried-up stream and drove along an avenue of
mulberry-trees, which in a few minutes conducted us to Saint-Péray,
where one found the vintage in full operation. Carts laden with tubs
filled with white and purple grapes, around which wasps without number
swarmed, were arriving from all points of the environs and crowding the
narrow streets. Any quantity of grapes were seemingly to be had for the
asking, for all the pretty girls in the place were gorging themselves
with the luscious-looking fruit. In the coopers’ yards bran-new casks
were ranged in rows in readiness for the newly-made wine, and through
open doorways, and in all manner of dim recesses, one caught sight of
sturdy men energetically trampling the gushing grapes under their bare
feet, and of huge creaking wine-presses reeking with the purple juice.
It was chiefly common red wine, of an excellent flavour, however, that
was being made in these nooks and corners, the sparkling white wine,
known as Saint-Péray, being manufactured in larger establishments, and
on more scientific principles. It
168

is from a white species of grape known as the petite and grosse
rousette       the same which yields the white Hermitage       that the
champagne of the south is produced, and the vineyards where they are
cultivated occupy all the more favourable slopes immediately outside the
village, the most noted being the Coteau-Gaillard, Solignaes, Thioulet,
and Hungary.

Although there is a close similarity between the manufacture of
champagne and the effervescing wine of Saint-Péray, there are still one
or two noteworthy variations. For a wine to be sparkling it is requisite
that it should ferment in the bottle, a      result obtained by bottling
it while it contains a certain undeveloped proportion of alcohol and
carbonic acid, represented by so much sugar, of which they are the
component parts. This ingredient has frequently to be added to the
Champagne wines to render them sparkling, but the wine of Saint-Péray in
its natural state contains so much sugar that any addition would be
deleterious. This excess of saccharine enables the manufacturer to
dispense with some of the operations necessary to the fabrication of
champagne, which, after fermenting in the cask, requires a second
fermentation to be provoked in the bottle, whereas the Saint-Péray wine
ferments only once, being bottled immediately it comes from the
wine-press.

The deposit in the wine after being impelled towards the neck of the
bottle is got rid of by following the same system as is pursued in the
Champagne, but no liqueur whatever is subsequently added to the wine. On
the other hand, it is a common practice to reduce the over-sweetness of
sparkling Saint-Péray in years when the grapes are more than usually
ripe by mixing with it some old dry white wine.

At Saint-Péray we visited the cellars of M. de Saint-Prix, one of the
principal wine-growers of the district. The samples of effervescing wine
which he produced for us to taste were of a pale golden colour, of a
slightly nutty flavour, and with a decided suggestion of the spirituous
essence known to be concentrated in the wine, one glass of which will go
quite as far towards elevating a person as three glasses of champagne.
169

Keeping the wine for a few years is said materially to improve its
quality, to the sacrifice, however, of its effervescent properties.
M.      de Saint-Prix informed us that he manufactured every year a
certain quantity of sparkling Côte-Rotie, Château-Grillé, and Hermitage.
The principal markets for the Saint-Péray sparkling wines       the
production of which falls considerably short of a million bottles per
annum       are England, Germany, Russia, Holland, and Belgium.





The other side of the Rhône is fruitful in minor sparkling wines,
chief amongst which is the so-called Clairette de Die, made at the town
of that name, a      place of some splendour, as existing antiquities
show, in the days of the Roman dominion in Gaul. Later on, Die was the
scene of constant struggles for supremacy between its counts and
bishops, one of the latter having been massacred by the populace in
front of the cathedral doorway       ever since known by the sinister
appellation of the Porte Rouge       and Catholics and Huguenots alike
devastated the town in the troublesome times of the Reform. Clairette de
Die is made principally from the blanquette or malvoisie variety of
grape, which, after the stalks have been removed, is both trodden with
the feet and pressed. The must is run off immediately into casks, and
four-and-twenty hours later it is racked into other casks,
a      similar operation being performed every two or three days for the
period of a couple of months, when the fermentation having subsided the
wine is fined and usually bottled in the following March. Newly-made
Clairette de Die is a sweet sparkling wine, but it loses its natural
effervescence after a
170

couple of years, unless it has been treated in the same manner as
champagne, which is rarely the case. The wine enjoys a reputation
altogether beyond its merits.

In addition to the well-known Clairette, some of the wine-growers of
Die make sparkling white and rose-coloured muscatels of superior
quality, which retain their effervescent properties for several years.
A      sparkling wine is also made some ten miles from Die, on the road
to Saillans, in a district bounded on the one side by the waters of the
Drôme, and on the other by strange mountains with helmet-shaped crests.
The centre of production is a locality called Vercheny, composed of
several hamlets, one of which, named Le Temple, was the original home of
the family of Barnave. The impressionable young deputy to the National
Assembly formed one of the trio sent to bring back the French royal
family from Varennes after their flight from Paris. It will be
remembered how, under the influence of Marie Antoinette and Madame
Elizabeth, Barnave became transformed during the journey into a faithful
partisan of their unhappy cause, and that he eventually paid the penalty
of his devotion with his life.

In the extreme south of France, and almost under the shadow of the
Pyrenees, a      sparkling wine of some repute is made at a place called
Lagrasse, about five-and-twenty miles westward of Narbonne, the
once-famous Mediterranean city, the maritime rival of Marseilles, and in
its palmy days, prior to the Christian era, a      miniature Rome, with
its capitol, its curia, its decemvirs, its consuls, its prætors, its
questors, its censors, and its ediles, and which boasted of being the
birthplace of three Roman Emperors. To-day Narbonne has to content
itself with the humble renown derived from its delicious honey and its
characterless full-bodied red wines. Limoux, so celebrated for its
Blanquette, lies a long way farther to the west, behind the Corbières
range of mountains that join on to the Pyrenees, and the jagged peaks,
deep barren gorges, and scarred sides of which have been witness of many
a desperate struggle during the century and a half when they formed the
boundary between France and Spain.

171

We arrived at Limoux just too late for the famous fête of the Black
Virgin, which lasts three weeks, and attracts crowds of southern
pilgrims to the chapel of Our Lady of Marseilles, perched on a little
hill some short distance from the town, with a fountain half-way up it,
whose water issues drop by drop, and has the credit of possessing
unheard-of virtues. The majority of pilgrims, however, exhibit a decided
preference for the new-made wine over the miraculous water, and for
one-and-twenty days something like a carnival of inebriety prevails at
Limoux.

Blanquette de Limoux derives its name from the species of grape it is
produced from, and which we believe to be identical with the malvoisie,
or malmsey. Its long-shaped berries grow in huge bunches, and dry
readily on the stalks. The fruit is gathered as tenderly as possible,
care being taken that it shall not be in the slightest degree bruised,
after which it is spread out upon a floor to admit of the sugar it
contains becoming perfect. The bad grapes having been carefully picked
out, and the pips extracted from the remaining fruit, the latter is now
trodden, when the must, after being filtered through a strainer, is
placed in casks, where it remains fermenting for about a week, during
which time any overflow is daily replenished by other must reserved for
the purpose. The wine is again clarified and placed in fresh casks with
the bungholes only lightly closed until all sensible fermentation has
ceased, when they are securely fastened up. The bottling takes place in
the month of March, and the wine is subsequently treated much after the
same fashion as sparkling Saint-Péray, excepting that it is generally
found necessary to repeat the operation of dégorgement three, if
not as many as four times.

Blanquette de Limoux is a pale white wine, the saccharine properties
of which have become completely transformed into carbonic acid gas and
alcohol. It is, consequently, both dry and spirituous, deficient in
delicacy, and altogether proves a great disappointment. At its best it
may, perhaps, rank with sparkling Saint-Péray, but unquestionably not
with any average champagne.

The
reader is by this time aware that sparkling wines are not indebted for
their effervescent properties to any particular variety of vine or
quality of soil, although some species of
173

grapes yield a wine possessing a higher degree of effervescence than
others. Any wine, in fact, can be rendered sparkling, although only
wines of a certain lightness of body and which are at the same time
delicate and clean to the taste       being devoid of anything
approaching to a goût de terroir       are really suited to the
purpose. Given a wine containing sufficient saccharine, either natural
or applied, and duly regulate its temperature, and it is easy enough to
render it sparkling. The Germans discovered this long ago when they
first transformed the acidulous wines of the Rhine into what we term
sparkling hocks.

The rise of this industry dates from the epoch of the final downfall
of Napoleon      I., when the officers of the armies of occupation
acquired more than a passing liking for the exhilarating products of
Clicquot and Moët, carrying it, in fact, home with them, and so
disseminating a taste for the sparkling wines of France throughout the
North of Europe. In Germany the wealthy few only were able to indulge in
it, and the consumption was for a long time exceedingly limited. When,
however, after many years of peace, riches began to accumulate, some
shrewd men set themselves to ascertain whether the German wines could
not be rendered sparkling like the French. This was satisfactorily and
speedily settled in the affirmative; but the great difficulty was to
find the requisite capital for the large preliminary investment
necessary to the establishment of a manufactory of sparkling wine on
even a moderate scale, and from which no return could be counted on for
the first three years. Eventually this was overcome; but the new wines,
being in the first instance altogether different in character from
champagne, found but little favour in the country of their production.
It was different, however, in England, where they speedily succeeded in
establishing themselves under the designations of sparkling hock and
sparkling moselle, and from this time forward they have retained their
position in the English market.

It is generally asserted that sparkling wines were first manufactured
in Germany more than half a century ago from the
174

inferior Neckar grape both at Esslingen and Heilbronn       the latter
rendered memorable by the exploits of Götz von Berlichingen, whose iron
hand distributed blows which effectually “cured headache, toothache, and
every other human malady.” Subsequently, towards 1830, a      former
chef de cave at Madame Clicquot’s establishment at Reims came to
Herr Lauteren, of Mayence, and suggested to him to engage in the
manufacture of sparkling Rhine wines, a      proposal which the latter
soon afterwards profited by; and eight years later Herr Rambs, of
Trèves, vineyard proprietor and wine-merchant, aided by a French
cellarman, made the earliest attempt to manufacture sparkling moselles,
their first trials in this direction resulting in a breakage amounting
to fifty per cent.

For some years the great anxiety of manufacturers of sparkling hocks
was to render their wines as much as possible like champagne, which was
only to be accomplished by disguising their true flavour and dosing them
largely with syrup. In this form they satisfied, and indeed still
satisfy, their German and Russian consumers; but of late years England
has set the example of a decided preference for the drier kinds of
sparkling wines, the result being that the character of the wines
destined for the English market has undergone a complete change.






THE AHR VALLEY.

Next to its sweetness the principal difference between German
champagne, or Moussirender Rheinwein as it is usually called, for
Continental consumption, and sparkling hocks designed for the English
and other markets, consists in the former being made principally from
black grapes, pressed immediately they are gathered and not allowed to
ferment in their skins, while the latter are made almost exclusively
from white grapes. The vineyards yielding the black grapes used for
these sparkling wines are mainly situated at Ingelheim, midway between
Bingen and Mayence, and in the Ahr valley, between Coblenz and Cologne.
At the black grape vintage, which precedes the gathering of the white
varieties by some three or four weeks, the fruit is conveyed to the
press in high tubs, carried on men’s backs, and holding about 40lbs.
apiece. The old wooden presses
175

are mostly employed, although of late small transportable presses with
iron screws, and of French manufacture, are coming into use. In order
that the wine may be pale in colour, the grapes, which, like those of
the Champagne, are of the pineau variety, are pressed as soon as
possible after the gathering; the pressure applied is, moreover, rapid
and not too strong, and the must is separated forthwith from the skins
and stalks. On the other hand, the white grapes used in the making of
German sparkling wine, and which are almost exclusively of the far-famed
riesling species, are treated precisely as when making still Rhine
wine       that is, they are crushed in the vineyards by means of
grape-mills, and afterwards pressed in the usual way. The must for
sparkling wines, whether from black or white grapes, is run at once into
casks to ferment. If possible it is conveyed in large casks known as
stucks       immediately after the pressing, and before fermentation
begins       to the manufacturer’s cellars in town; but if this cannot
be accomplished it remains in the cellars of the district until the
first fermentation is over, which is in December or January. It is then
racked off its lees, and the produce of
176

black and white grapes is blended together, only a small proportion of
the former entering into the composition of true sparkling hock, which
should retain in a marked degree the subtile and fragrant perfume of the
riesling grape.

The process pursued in the manufacture of sparkling hocks is the same
as that followed with regard to champagnes. The quantity of grape sugar
generated in these Northern German latitudes being far from large, both
hocks and moselles invariably need a small addition of saccharine,
previous to their being put into bottle, to insure the requisite
effervescence, whereas in the Champagne the practice of adding sugar
with this object is not the uniform rule. After the wine is bottled it
remains in a cool cellar for eighteen months or a couple of years, being
constantly shaken during this period, in the same way as champagne, in
order to force the sediment to deposit itself near to the cork. By this
time the added as well as the natural sugar contained in the wine has
become converted into alcohol and carbonic acid; and after the sediment
has been expelled from the bottle the operation of dosing, or
flavouring, the wine takes place.

Sparkling hocks intended both for the German and Russian markets are
frequently almost cloying in their sweetness, as much as one-fifth of
syrup being often added to four-fifths of wine. The sparkling moselles,
too, for Russia, and not unfrequently for England also, are largely
dosed with the preparation of elder-flowers, which imparts to them their
well-known muscatel flavour and perfume. The manufacturers say they are
doing their best to abandon this absurd practice of artificially
perfuming sparkling moselles; but many of their customers, and
especially those in the English provinces, stipulate for the scented
varieties, possibly from an erroneous belief in their superiority.
Effervescing Rhine wines of the highest class have a marked and refined
flavour, together with a very decided natural bouquet. Moreover, they
retain their effervescent properties for a considerable time after being
uncorked, and appear to the taste as light, if not precisely as
delicate, as the finer
177

champagnes, although in reality such is not the case; for all sparkling
hocks possess greater body than even the heaviest champagnes, and
cannot, therefore, be drunk with equal freedom.

Great impetus was given to the manufacture of German sparkling wines
during the war of 1870, when the Champagne was in a measure closed to
the outside world. At this epoch the less scrupulous manufacturers,
instigated by dishonest speculators, boldly forged both the brands on
the corks and the labels on the bottles of the great Reims and Epernay
firms, and sent forth sparkling wines of their own production to the
four quarters of the globe as veritable champagnes of the highest class.
The respectable houses acted more honestly, and, as it turned out, with
better policy, for by maintaining their own labels and brands they
extended the market for their produce, causing German sparkling wines to
be introduced under their true names into places where they had never
penetrated before, the result being a considerable increase in the
annual demand, even after the stores of the champagne manufacturers were
again open to all the world.

Owing to this increased demand, and the deficient supply of suitable
Rhine wines at a moderate price, the manufacturers of sparkling hocks
are reduced to buy much of their raw wine at a distance, and are to-day
large purchasers of the growths of the Palatinate, which are less
delicate than the vintages of the Rheingau, besides being deficient in
that fine aroma which distinguishes genuine hock. A      leading
manufacturer computes that between four-and-a-half and five million
bottles of sparkling wine are made annually in Germany, where there are
no fewer than fifty manufacturing establishments. The principal market
is Great Britain, which consumes some two millions of bottles annually;
a      million bottles are drunk at home; while the remainder is divided
among the North of Europe, the United States, India, Australia, China,
and Japan. The cheapness of these wines is, no doubt, largely in their
favour.








MESSRS. DEINHARD       CO.’S NEW ESTABLISHMENT AT COBLENZ.
(p.      178)

At Coblenz, the capital of Rhenish Prussia, and one of the strongest
fortresses in the world, the so-called blue Moselle
178

mingles its waters with those of the Rhine, and hence the original Roman
name of Confluentia. With so favourable a situation it is not surprising
that the city should be the abode of several important firms trading in
the wines of the two rivers. At the head of these is the well-known
house of Deinhard and Co., dealing extensively both in the magnificent
still vintages of the Rheingau and the Moselle, and the higher-class
sparkling wines of these districts. In the resident partner, Herr Julius
Wegeler, I      was pleased to meet again my courteous colleague of the
Wine Jury of the Vienna Exhibition, and accompanied by him I went over
their establishment on the Clemens Platz       one of the most perfect
and admirably appointed in Germany. The firm was founded in 1798 by Herr
F.      Deinhard, who in 1806, when Coblenz was in the hands of the
French, secured a ninety-nine years’ lease of some cellars under an old
convent at the low rental of 30 francs per annum, and to-day this
curious document exists amongst the archives of the firm. Rents of
wine-cellars were low enough in those days of uncertainty and peril,
when commerce was at a standstill and Europe gazed panic-stricken on the
course of warlike events; nevertheless, for such a trifle as 30 francs a
year of course no very extensive entrepôt could have been rented. To-day
Messrs. Deinhard’s new cellars on the Clemens Platz alone cover an area
of nearly 43,000 square feet, besides which they have several other
vaults stored with wine in various quarters of the city, the whole
giving employment to upwards of eighty workmen and a score of coopers.
Their Clemens Platz establishment was only completed in the autumn of
1875, when it was formally inaugurated in presence of the Empress
Augusta, who left behind her the following graceful memento of her
visit:       


“In grateful attachment to Coblenz, in full appreciation of a work which
does honour to the town and to the firm, I      wish continued
prosperity to both.


Augusta,


“German Empress and Queen of Prussia.”








MESSRS. DEINHARD       CO.’S NEW CELLARS AT COBLENZ. (p. 179.)

The proximity of the establishment to the Rhine did not allow of the
cellars being excavated to a greater depth than 30
179

feet below the surface       a      mere trifle when compared with the
depth of many vaults in the Champagne. Any lower excavation, however,
would have been attended with danger, and as it is, when the Rhine rose
to an unusual height in March, 1876, the water percolated through the
soil and inundated the lower cellars to a height of 5      feet. Above
these vaults is a corresponding range of buildings of picturesque design
and substantial construction, divided like the cellars into three
aisles, each 210 feet in length and 23 feet broad. One of the arches of
the façade looking on to the courtyard is decorated with a graceful and
characteristic bas-relief, an engraving of which is subjoined.





The cellars, containing 1,400 stucks, as they are termed, of still
wines       the stuck being equal to 1,500 bottles       present a
striking appearance with their long vistas of vaulted arcades, admirably
built of brick, and illuminated by innumerable gas jets, aided by
powerful reflectors at the extremities of the three aisles. The
capacious elliptical-headed casks, ranged side by side in uninterrupted
sequence, contain the choicest German vintages, including the grand
wines of the Rheingau       Johannisberger, Steinberger, Rudesheimer,
Rauenthaler, and the like; the red growths of Assmannshausen and
Walporzheim; Deidesheimers,
180

with rare bouquets and of tender tonical flavour; Liebfrauenmilch, of
flowery perfume; the finest Moselles from Josefshof and Scharzhofberg,
Brauneberg and Berncastel, with other growths too numerous to mention,
of grand years, and from the best situations.

The sparkling wines stored in separate vaults form to-day an
important item in Messrs. Deinhard’s business. In 1843 the firm made
their first cuvée, consisting of less than 10,000 bottles. Four years
later their cuvée amounted to over 50,000 bottles. A      falling off
was shown during the revolutionary epoch, and business only recovered
its normal condition in 1851, since which time it has gradually
increased as the wines have grown in favour, until in 1875 the tirage of
1874 vintage wines exceeded half a million bottles.






VINEYARDS IN THE AHR VALLEY.

Messrs. Deinhard draw their supplies of wine from white grapes, for
conversion into sparkling wines, from the Rhine, the Main, the Moselle,
and the Palatinate, giving preference to the produce of the riesling
grape, as to this the wine is indebted for its natural bouquet. The
proportion of wine from black grapes, mingled with the other wines, is
vintaged by themselves in the Ahr valley and at Ingelheim on the Rhine.
The Ahr, in summer a rippling streamlet and in winter a rushing torrent,
falls into the Rhine about twenty miles below Coblenz. The soil of the
neighbouring hills seems peculiarly adapted for the growth of black
grapes, one of the best of German red wines being produced in the
vineyards adjacent to the village of Walporzheim. In order that the wine
may be as pale as possible, the black grapes are pressed as soon after
gathering as they can be, and only the juice resulting from the first
pressure is reserved, the subsequently extracted must being sold to the
small growers of the neighbourhood. The newly-made wine is brought in
casks to Coblenz, and rests for eight weeks while completing its
fermentation. It is then racked into stucks and double stucks, and is
blended in casks of the latter capacity during the early part of the
following year, great care being taken to preserve the bouquet of the
white grapes, with which view, contrary to the practice followed in the
181

Champagne, only a moderate proportion of wine from black grapes enters
into the blend.











ON THE BRIDGE AT
RECH, AHR VALLEY.




Next comes the fining, and four weeks afterwards the wine is newly
racked. The bottling takes place during May or June, when any deficiency
of natural saccharine in the wine is supplied by the addition of pure
sugar-candy. At Messrs. Deinhard’s the wine is bottled at a temperature
of 72° Fahr., and the bottles remain resting on large stone tables until
the fermentation is completed, and the saccharine is converted into
alcohol and carbonic acid gas. This result is commonly obtained in
ordinary hot weather in eight days’ time, most of the breakage taking
place during this interval. If on being tested with a manometer the wine
should indicate too high a pressure, it is at once removed to a cool
cellar, consequently the average total breakage rarely exceeds 2¼
182

per cent. The wine is now left quiet for at least a year, and if
possible for two years, after which the bottles are placed on stands in
the customary inverted position, and shaken daily for a period of six
weeks, in order to dislodge the sediment and force it against the cork.
German workmen are far less expert at this operation than their fellows
in the Champagne, as few of the former can manage more than their
four-and-twenty thousand bottles per diem. The disgorgement and
liqueuring of the wine is accomplished at Messrs. Deinhard’s and other
German establishments in precisely the same fashion as is followed in
the Champagne.

The dry sparkling hocks we tasted here had the real riesling flavour
and the fine natural perfume common to this grape. In preparing them no
attempt had been made to imitate champagne; but, on the other hand,
every care had been taken to preserve the true hock character with its
distinguishing freshness of taste combined with a lightness which wines
containing liqueur in excess could never have exhibited. The sparkling
moselles, too, depended not on any imparted muscatel flavour and
perfume, but on their own natural bouquet and the flavour they derive
from the schistous soil in which these wines are grown.

the romantic Liebenstein and
Sterrenberg, the legendary Lurlei, the tribute-exacting Pfalz, and the
old town of Bacharach, famous in the Middle Ages for its wine
mart       we eventually come to Lorch, where the Wisper brook flows
into the Rhine, and the grand wine-producing district known as the
Rheingau begins. A      few miles higher up are the vineyards of
Assmannshausen, dominated by the Niederwald, and yielding the finest red
wine in all Germany. Then passing by Bishop Hatto’s legendary tower we
emerge from the gorge of the Rhine and soon reach Rüdesheim, crouched at
the foot of lofty terraced vineyards, which, according to doubtful
tradition, were planted with Burgundy and Orleans vines by Charlemagne.
Rüdesheim, like other antiquated little Rhine-side towns, boasts its
ancient castle with its own poetical
185

legend, while many modern houses have sprung up there of late years, and
signs of further development are apparent on all sides. In the outskirts
of the town there are a couple of sparkling wine establishments, the one
nigh the railway station on the western side belonging to Messrs.
Dietrich and Co., while eastwards on a picturesque slope overlooking the
Rhine, and in the midst of extensive pleasure-grounds, is the
establishment of Messrs. Ewald and Co., who date from the year 1858, and
rank to-day amongst the leading shippers of sparkling hocks and moselles
to England.









MESSRS. EWALD       CO.’S ESTABLISHMENT AT RÜDESHEIM. (p. 185)

Here are handsome and capacious buildings aboveground, and two floors
of cellars comprising five vaults, each 160 feet in length and 30 feet
broad. The lower vaults, 40 feet from the surface, are arched over and
walled with stone, while the upper ones are faced with brick, both being
floored with concrete and slanting towards the centre to allow of the
wine from bottles that have burst running off. Each range of cellars is
separately ventilated by shafts, generally kept open in winter and
closed in the summer so as to maintain a temperature not exceeding 47°
Fahr. in the lower cellars and under 52° in those above. Moreover, with
the view of conducing to this result the cellars have an ice well
communicating with them.

Late in the spring, when the newly-bottled wine indicates a
sufficient number of atmospheres to insure a satisfactory effervescence,
it is deposited in the lower vaults, the upper ones being devoted to
reserve wines in wood and wines awaiting the process of disgorgement, or
undergoing their daily shaking in order to force the deposit against the
cork. Aboveground there are rooms for storing the liqueur, the corks,
and the packing-cases, and in a spacious apartment, provided with three
lifts for communicating with the cellars beneath, the wine is blended
and bottled, and in due time disgorged and packed. In very warm weather,
however, it is found preferable for the disgorging and its attendant
operations to be performed in the cooler temperature of the cellars.
Messrs. Ewald formerly tested the strength of their bottles with a
manometer before
186

using them, but for some time past they have given up the practice,
feeling convinced that it was productive of more harm than good. Glass
is an amorphous and unelastic substance which, although it will stand a
high pressure once, often succumbs when put to a second test by the
action of the fermenting wine. The firm calculate their annual breakage
at from 2½ to 3 per cent.

Messrs. Ewald being installed almost in the heart or the Rheingau can
readily draw their supplies of wine from the most favoured localities.
Johannisberg is within a few miles of Rüdesheim, and in those years
when, owing to the grapes not having thoroughly ripened, the wine is
only of intermediate value as a still wine, it serves admirably for
conversion into sparkling wine, retaining as it does its powerful
bouquet. Ingelheim, too, noted for its vineyards of black grapes, whose
produce is much sought after for blending with the finer sparkling Rhine
wines, is only a few miles higher up the river, on the opposite bank.
The drier varieties of sparkling hocks and moselles shipped by Messrs.
Ewald to England have the merit of retaining all the fine flavour and
natural perfume of the higher-class growths from which, as a rule, these
wines are prepared.









THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MATHEUS MÜLLER AT ELTVILLE. (p. 186)

Above Rüdesheim the waters of the Rhine expand, the left bank of the
river, if still lofty, is no longer precipitous, while the right
continues almost flat so soon as the Rochusberg is left behind. Between
here and Eltville all the more celebrated vineyards of the Rheingau are
passed in rapid succession       Geisenheim-Rothenberg, Johannisberg,
Steinberg, Marcobrunn, Kiedrich-Grafenberg, Rauenthal, and others. At
Eltville       the former capital of the Rheingau, and where Gunther, of
Schwarzburg, resigned his crown to Charles IV., and died poisoned, it is
said, by his successful rival       we find one of the most extensive
wine establishments in Germany, that of Matheus Müller, who enjoys a
high reputation in England both for his still and sparkling hocks and
moselles. His stock ordinarily consists of from 800 to 1,000
stuck       equivalent to a quarter of a million gallons       of still
Rhine and Moselle wines, much of it of the
187

best years, and from vineyards of repute, together with nearly a million
bottles of sparkling wines stored in his cellars at Eltville and on the
road to Erbach, the aggregate length of which is some 3,400 feet. The
sparkling wines repose in long cool vaulted galleries similar to many
cellars in the Champagne, while the still wines are stored in capacious
subterranean halls each 100 yards in length.





For his higher-class sparkling hocks Herr Müller derives his
principal supplies from the Rheingau, partly from his own vineyards at
Eltville, Rauenthal, and Hattenheim, and partly by purchases at Erbach,
Hallgarten, Œstrich, Winkel, Johannisberg, Geisenheim, and Rudesheim;
while for his best sparkling moselles, Berncastel, Graach, Trèves, and
the Saar districts are laid under contribution. The Palatinate growths
of Dürkheim, Deidesheim, Mussbach, Haardt, Rhodt,      c., serve as the
basis for the medium and cheaper sparkling hocks, and for sparkling
moselles of a corresponding character such wines as Zeltinger,
Rachtiger, Erdener, Aldegonder, Winninger,      c., are used. Ingelheim
and Heidesheim furnish the wine from black grapes necessary in a
subordinate degree to all sparkling hocks, and very freely had recourse
to when it is desired to impart a champagne character to the wine, as is
commonly the case when this is intended for consumption in Germany. Herr
Müller invariably presses the black grapes himself, in order that the
wine may be as light in colour as possible. As the house annually lays
down large stocks of vin brut it is under no necessity of
188

drawing upon them until they have attained the requisite maturity and
developed all their finer qualities.

The dry sparkling hocks and moselles, such as are shipped by Herr
Müller to England and its colonies, receive a large addition of liqueur
when destined for the Russian market. His sparkling Johannisberger and
high-class sparkling moselle from Rheingau and Moselle wines of superior
vintages are of delicate flavour and great softness, and are frequently
shipped without any liqueur whatever. Besides Moussirender Rheinwein of
a champagne character, and largely consumed in Germany and Belgium, Herr
Müller makes a veritable champagne from wine imported by him from the
Champagne district. His shipments also include red sparkling
Assmannshauser       the result of a blend of Assmannshauser,
Ingelheimer, and other red Rhenish wines       aromatic and full-bodied,
and dry or moderately sweet according to the country to which it is
intended to be exported.









ENTRANCE TO LAUTEREN SOHN’S ESTABLISHMENT, MAYENCE. (p. 188)

The trade in German sparkling wines has numerous representatives at
Mayence       the sec of St. Boniface, the apostle of the Germans, and
the birthplace of Gutenberg, whose fame is universal. The pioneer of
printing was born in a house at the corner of the Emmerans and Pfandhaus
gasse, the site of which is to-day occupied by the residence of three
members of the firm of C.      Lauteren Sohn, established at Mayence so
far back as 1794, and one of the first in Germany to devote itself to
the manufacture of sparkling wines. In 1830 the firm profited by an
offer made to them by a cellarman who had been for many years in the
service of Madame Clicquot at Reims. The Emmerans-gasse, where the chief
establishment of the firm is situated, is in the older quarter of
Mayence       in the midst of a network of intricate winding streets
bordered by picturesque tall gabled houses and edifices of the Spanish
type where ornamental oriel windows with quaint supports, medallions,
and bas-reliefs of varied design continually catch the eye, and saints
look down upon one from almost every corner. Passing under the gateway
of the house where Gutenberg was born, and in the rear of
189

which Lauteren Sohn have their offices, cooperage, and cellars for still
wines, we notice on our left hand a tablet commemorating the birth of
the inventor of printing in these terms:       


“Gensfleisch House. Family residence of the inventor of the art of
printing, John Gensfleisch of Gutenberg, who in the year 1398 was here
born. Christian Lauteren has dedicated on the site of the ancient house
this memorial to the immortal inventor, Jan. 29, 1825.”

Messrs. Lauteren’s cellars for sparkling wines extend mainly under an
old monastery, and comprise a succession of large vaulted galleries
connected by narrow passages with arched entrances. Here are stacked
some 800,000 bottles of wine in varying conditions of maturity. Messrs.
Lauteren bottle their wines in August, instead of fully two months
earlier according to the usual practice, in the belief that the system
they pursue is more conducive to perfect effervescence, besides being
attended with less breakage, owing to the newly-bottled wine escaping
the heat of the summer. All the arrangements at this establishment are
very complete. There is a place for everything, and everything is to be
found in its place. Adjoining the courtyard, where new bottles are
stacked beneath open ornamental sheds, are the tasting-room and the
apartment where the operations of disgorging, dosing, and re-corking are
performed. The liqueur added by the firm to their sparkling wines is
kept in bottle from three to five years before being used. In the
tasting-room we were shown a variety of sparkling hocks and moselles,
the former with all the distinguishing characteristics of fine Rhine
wine, the older samples having gained considerably in softness.
A      dry Cabinet specimen submitted to us exhibited a fine bouquet and
much delicacy of flavour. The moselles we found particularly
interesting, made as they were of genuine wines from some of the best
vineyards of the Moselle district.

The largest German sparkling wine establishment is at Hochheim,
which, although, situated on the banks of the Main, and several miles
distant from its confluence with the Rhine, has curiously enough
supplied us with a generic name under which we inconsistently class the
entire produce of the Rhine
190

vineyards. Behind the Hochheim railway station there rises a long low
slope, planted from base to summit with vines, a      portion of which
are screened on the north by a plain-looking church and a
weather-stained deanery. The vines thus sheltered yield the famous Dom
Dechanei, the finest Hochheimer known. Some short distance off in a
westerly direction are the extensive premises of the Hochheim Sparkling
Wine Association, whose brands are well known in England. The firm of
Burgeff and Co., whose business the association acquired in 1858 and
subsequently considerably extended, was founded in 1837. At this
establishment all the arrangements are of the most perfect character.
The bottles are cleaned by a machine employing ten persons, and turning
out several thousand bottles a day. All the bottles moreover, before
being used, have their strength tested by an ingenious apparatus which
subjects them to three or four times the pressure they are likely to
undergo when filled with wine. Pumps, bottle-washing machine, and the
revolving casks in which the sugar is dissolved for the liqueur, are all
moved by steam, and the association even manufactures the gas used for
lighting up the establishment. We tasted here several sparkling hocks
distinguished by their high flavour and refinement, with sparkling
moselles vintaged in the best localities and equally excellent in
quality.

Sparkling hocks and moselles are made by Messrs. Stock and Sons at
Creuznach, a      favourite watering-place in the romantic Nahe valley,
noted for the picturesque porphyry cliffs which occasionally rise
precipitously at the river’s edge. Creuznach, where a capital wine is
vintaged, on the southern slopes of the Schlossberg, is at no great
distance from Bingen. Messrs. Stock and Sons’ establishment dates from
1862, and their sparkling wines are mainly made from white grapes, only
about one-eighth of white wine from black grapes entering into their
composition. The latter is vintaged at Ingelheim, the grapes being
pressed under the firm’s own superintendence, and only the must
resulting from the first squeeze of the press being used. The wine from
riesling grapes is usually from the
191

Rhine, and with it is mingled a certain quantity of wine vintaged on the
Hessian plain. The vintage generally occurs at the end of October, and
the firm remove the new wine to their cellars at Creuznach early in the
ensuing spring, and bottle it in the May or June following. They make
both dry and sweet varieties of sparkling wines, and their principal
markets are England, Germany, the East and West Indies, the United
States, and Australia.






BINGEN.

The establishment of G. C. Kessler and Co. at
Esslingen       formerly one of the most important of the free imperial
cities, and picturesquely situated on the Neckar       was founded as
far back as 1826, and claims to be the oldest sparkling wine factory in
Germany. The wine employed comes from vineyards
192

in the vicinity of Heilbronn, and others in the Rheingau and the Grand
Duchy of Baden, and is more or less a blend of the clevener, traminer,
rulander, riesling, and elbling varieties of grape. The vintage takes
place in October, and the bottling of the wine is effected during the
following summer. Messrs. Kessler and Co. treat their wines after the
system pursued at the Clicquot champagne establishment, in which the
founder of the Esslingen house held an important position for a period
of nearly twenty years. The wines are prepared sweet or dry according to
the market they are destined for. The principal business of the firm is
with Germany, but they also export to England, the United States, the
East Indies, and Australia. Their wines have met with favourable
recognition at various exhibitions, notably that of Paris in 1867, when
a silver medal was awarded them; and at Vienna in 1873, where they
received a medal for progress.






THE NECKAR AT HEIDELBERG.

Wurzburg, one of the most antiquated and picturesque of German
cities, is noted for its sparkling Franconian wines vintaged
193

partly in the vineyards that overspread the tall chalk hills which close
in around the quaint old university town. The most famous of these
vineyards are the Leist and the Stein, the first-named sloping downward
towards the Main from the foot of the picturesque Marienberg fort,
which, perched on the summit of a commanding height, dominates the city
and forms so conspicuous an object in all the views of it. The extensive
buildings of the fort not only shield the vines from the winds, but
reflect the sun’s rays upon them, thereby materially conducing to the
perfect ripening of the grapes at a much earlier period than is
customary. The Stein vineyard is situated on the opposite side of the
Main, and when viewed from the picturesque bridge, studded with
incongruous colossal statues       such as Joseph and the Virgin Mary in
close proximity to Charlemagne and Pépin       seems to rise up as an
immense rampart behind the city. Here the river acts as a reflector,
throwing back the sun’s rays on the lower portions of the slope, where
the finest wine is naturally vintaged. An altogether inferior growth is
produced on the hill to the north, known as the Middle Stein, and also
in the Harfe vineyard, situated in the rear of the latter. The prevalent
vines in the Würzburg district are the riesling, the traminer, the
elbling, and the rulander, or pineau gris.

The first sparkling wine establishment at Würzburg was founded in
1842 by Herr Oppmann, the Royal cellar-master, who died in 1866. The
position held by this individual was one of considerable importance, for
the King of Bavaria is the largest wine-grower in his own dominions, and
stores the produce of his vineyards in the famous cellars extending
beneath one of the wings of the deserted Residenz, erected at an epoch
when Würzburg was subject to episcopal rule. These cellars, vaulted in
stone, are on a vast scale, and possibly unequalled in the world. You
descend a broad flight of steps, flanked by ornamental iron balustrades,
and encounter half-way down a miniature tun, guarded by the Bavarian
lions posted in a niche in the wall. Following your guide with lighted
candles, you pass between rows upon rows of capacious casks filled with
the wine last
194

vintaged, and various wines of recent years; large metal
chandeliers       fantastically adorned with innumerable coloured
bottles and glasses, and designed to light up the cellars on festive
occasions       here and there descending from the arched roof.
Eventually you arrive at a gallery where huge casks are poised on
massive wooden frames in double tiers one above the other. These cellars
are said to be capable of holding upwards of 500 casks, but at the time
of our visit there were scarcely half that number, and only a mere
fraction of these were filled with wine. The cellars no longer contain
any of that archaic wine vintaged in 1546, for which they were formerly
celebrated. Indeed, all the historic vintages, once their boast, were
removed some years ago to Munich and deposited in the Royal cellars
there. Of the ancient ornamental tuns holding their ten thousand gallons
each, which the Würzburg cellars formerly contained, only a single one
remains, constructed in the year 1784. This tun, carved on the front
with the Bavarian arms, is about the dimensions of a fair-sized
apartment, and being no longer filled with wine, a      Diogenes of the
period might take up his abode in it with perfect comfort. Herr Michael
Oppmann, who has succeeded to the establishment founded by his father,
prepares several varieties of white sparkling Franconian wine, with two
kinds of red, and also sparkling hocks and moselles. The first-named
wines are vintaged in the best vineyards of Lower Franconia, in the
valley of the Main, and the Baden Oberland, the finer qualities being
principally produced from the black clevener grape, usually vintaged the
first or second week in October. The white grape vintage occurs some
fortnight or more later, and the wine is bottled either late in the
spring or during the coming summer. Its after-manipulation differs in no
respect from that pursued with reference to champagne. Herr Oppmann,
whose wines have met with favourable recognition at various foreign and
home Exhibitions, prepares both sweet and dry varieties. Their chief
market is Germany, although they are exported in fair quantities to
Belgium, England, and Northern Europe.











AT AHRWEILER.




Another sparkling wine establishment was founded at
195

Würzburg by Herr F.      A. Siligmuller in 1843. The wine from white
grapes employed by him is vintaged partly in his own vineyards on the
Stein and the Harfe, and partly in other Main vineyards, at
Randersacker, Escheradorf,      c., the wine used by him from red grapes
coming from the Baden Oberland around the so-called
Kaisers-stuhl       an isolated vine-clad dolerite mountain bordering
the Rhine, and on the verge almost of the Black Forest       and from
the neighbourhood of Offenburg, one of the ancient imperial free towns,
which has lately raised a statue to Sir Francis Drake, “the introducer,”
as the inscription says, “of the potato into Europe.” The vintage here,
which commences fully a fortnight earlier than around Würzburg, usually
takes place about the beginning of October, and the wine is bottled in
the height of the following summer. Herr Siligmuller’s wines, of which
there are four qualities, were awarded a medal for progress at the
Vienna Exhibition of 1873.

Sparkling
wines are made in various parts of Austria and Hungary, and of late
years their produce has been largely on the increase. At Voslau, in the
vicinity of the picturesque and
197

fashionable summer watering-place of Baden, about twenty miles south of
Vienna, Herr R.      Schlumberger, one of my colleagues on the wine jury
at the Vienna and Paris Exhibitions of 1873 and ’8, makes a white
sparkling Voslauer       introduced into England some years
since       from the blue portuguese, the burgundy (the pineau noir),
the rulander (the pineau gris), and the riesling varieties of grape. It
is, however, at Graz, the capital of Styria, picturesquely situated on
the river Mur, and surrounded by lofty mountains, where sparkling wines
are made upon the largest scale and with the most success. By far the
principal manufactory is that of Kleinoscheg Brothers, founded in the
year 1850, at an epoch when the larger Styrian wine-growers were
directing their attention to the general improvement of their vineyards.
The firm gained their knowledge of sparkling wines by practical
experience acquired in the Champagne itself, and to-day they
unquestionably produce some of the best sparkling wines that are made
out of France. They possess extensive vineyards of their own, and are
also large purchasers of wines from the best districts, including
Pettau, Radkersburg, the Picherergebirge, and Luttenberg, the latter
yielding the finest wine which Styria produces, vintaged from the mosler
or furmint       that is, the Tokay variety of grape.

White wine from the clevener grape, understood to be identical with
the pineau noir of Burgundy and the Champagne, and vintaged early in
October, forms the basis of the sparkling wines manufactured by
Kleinoscheg Brothers. The produce of several other grapes, however,
enters in a limited degree into the blend, including the riesling, the
rulander or pineau gris, and the portuguese, the gathering of which is
usually delayed several weeks later, and is sometimes even deferred
until the end of November. The first and second pressings of the black
grapes yield a white must as in the Champagne, while the third and
fourth give a pink wine of which the firm make a speciality.

The wines, which are treated precisely after the system pursued in
the Champagne, are bottled during the months of July
198

and August, and are made either sweet or dry according to the country
they are destined for. Considerable shipments of the dry pale Styrian
champagne take place to England, where the firm also send a delicate
sparkling muscatel and a sparkling red burgundy, which will favourably
compare with the best sparkling wines of the Côte d’Or. They have also a
large market for their wines in Austria, Germany, Italy, and
Switzerland, and export to British North America, the East Indies,
China, Japan, and Australia. From the year 1855 up to the present time
the firm of Kleinoscheg Brothers have been awarded no less than sixteen
medals for their sparkling wines at various important home and foreign
exhibitions.

At Marburg on the river Drave, in the vicinity of the Bacher
Mountains, which stretch far into Carinthia, and have their lower slopes
covered with vines, Herr F.      Auchmann has established a successful
sparkling wine manufactory. The raw wine comes from the vineyards around
Marburg and from Pettau, some ten or twelve miles lower down the Drave.
The vintage commonly lasts from the middle of October until the middle
of November. Black grapes of the clevener and portuguese varieties are
pressed as in the Champagne, so as to yield a white must, with which a
certain portion of white wine from the mosler or furmint grape is
subsequently mingled. The bottling takes place as early as April or May.
The wines are principally consumed in Austria, but are also exported to
Russia, Italy, Egypt, the Danubian Principalities, Australia,
     c.

Sparkling wines seem to be made in various parts of Hungary, judging
from the samples sent to the Vienna and Paris Exhibitions from Pesth,
Pressburg, Oedenburg, Pécs, Velencze, and Kolozsvár. Rose-colour wines
are evidently much in favour with the respective manufacturers, several
of whom make sparkling red wines as well, but with none of the success
of their Styrian neighbours. The best Hungarian sparkling wines we have
met with are those of Hubert and Habermann, made at Pressburg, the
former capital of Hungary, where its kings, after being crowned, used to
ride up the Königsberg brandishing the
199

sword of St. Stephen towards the four points of the compass in token of
their determination to defend the kingdom against all enemies. The white
sparkling wines are made exclusively from white grapes grown in the
neighbouring vineyards of Bösing, <ins class = "mycorr" title =
"spelling unchanged">Geñnau, and St. Georgen, but the firm make
red sparkling wines as well from the produce of the Ratzersdorf and
Wainor vineyards. The vintage takes place some time in October, and the
wines are bottled both in the spring and autumn, but never until they
are fully twelve months old. With these variations the system pursued
with regard to the wines is the same as is followed in the Champagne.
There are several other sparkling wine manufacturers at Pressburg, and
the principal market for these wines is Austro-Hungary, but shipments of
them are made to England, the United States, India, Roumania, and
Servia. The production of sparkling wine in Hungary is now estimated to
amount to one million bottles annually.

In Croatia Prince Lippe-Schaumburg has established a sparkling wine
manufactory at Slatina, where he produces a so-called
Riesling-Champagner, and it would appear from the collection of
Austro-Hungarian sparkling wines exhibited at Vienna by Herr Bogdan Hoff
of Cracow, that these wines are also made at Melnik, in Bohemia, at
Bisenz in Moravia, at Sebenicodi Maraschino in Dalmatia, at Botzen in
the Tyrol, at Tasnad in Transylvania, and at Weiss-Kirchen in the Banat.
All these wines had been submitted to examination at the Imperial
œno-chemical laboratory at Klosterneuberg, and one was not surprised to
find that the majority were pronounced to be of too robust a character
for transformation into sparkling wines.

Switzerland long since turned its attention to the manufacture of
sparkling wines, not, however, to meet the requirements of its own
population, but those of the many tourists with well-lined purses who
annually explore its valleys, lakes, and mountains. Neuchâtel champagne
has met with a certain amount of success, and at the present time there
are a couple of establishments devoted to its production, the best known
being that of Bouvier
200

frères. There are, moreover, sparkling wine manufactories at Vevay in
the Vaud Canton, and at Sion in the Valais. In the Canton of Neuchâtel
the best Swiss red wines are produced       notably Cortaillod and
Faverge of a ruby hue and Burgundy-like flavour       and the sparkling
wine manufacturers of the district wisely blend a considerable
proportion of wine from black grapes with that from white when making
their cuvées. Vaud, on the other hand, being noted for white
wines bearing some resemblance to certain Rhine growths, it is of these
that sparkling wines are exclusively made at Vevay.

The Vevay vineyards occupy the heights which skirt the Lake of Geneva
on its northern side. The innumerable terraces, steep and difficult of
access to the toiling vine-dresser, on which the vines are planted, are
the result of centuries of patient labour. Here the vine seems to
flourish at an altitude of more than 1,800 feet above the sea level. To
compensate for the deficiency of sunshine the leaves are largely
stripped from the vines so as to expose the fruit, and thereby assist
its ripening.

The sparkling wine factory at Sion, bordering the river Rhône, in the
Canton of the Valais, was established in 1872 by MM.      de Riedmatten
and De Quay, who derive their raw wine from vineyards in the immediate
neighbourhood, almost all of which have a southern exposure, and occupy
gentle slopes. The soil chiefly consists of a decomposed limestone
schist, locally termed “brisé.” In these vineyards, and more especially
the district known as the Clavaux, some of the best and most alcoholic
wines in Switzerland are produced.

The firm originally experimented with the choicer and more powerful
growths, and, as may be imagined, soon discovered they were not well
adapted for conversion into sparkling wines. To-day they limit
themselves to wines produced from what is known as the “fendant” variety
of grape, said by some to be identical with the German riesling, and by
others to be of the same type as the French chasselas. The vintage in
the Valais is the earliest in Switzerland, taking place in favourable
years at the close of September, but ordinarily in the course of
201

October. Some fine white candy syrup is added to the wine at the epoch
of bottling, in order to provoke the requisite effervescence, which it
does so effectually that the tirage is obliged to take place some time
between November and May, as at any other period the temperature would
be too high and the bottles would burst. MM.      Riedmatten and De Quay
have two varieties of sparkling wine       their Carte Blanche, which
goes under the name of Mont Blanc, and is rather sweet, and their Carte
Verte known as Glacier de Rhône, a      drier variety and finding a
readier sale.

Of late years, since many improvements have been effected in Italy
both in the cultivation of the vineyards and the vintaging of the wine,
numerous attempts have been made, although on the whole with but
indifferent success, to produce a good sparkling wine. The principal
seat of the manufacture is Asti, where the Societa Unione Enofila make
considerable quantities of a common strong sweet sparkling wine, as well
as a sparkling muscatel. Alessandria, Ancona, Bologna, Castagnolo,
Genoa, Modena, Naples, Palermo, and Treviso also profess to make
sparkling wines, but only in insignificant quantities. Alessandria
produces sparkling malmsey and red sparkling brachetto; and on the
Marquis Della Stufa’s estate of Castagnolo a sparkling wine is
manufactured from the currajola variety of grape, one of the best in the
Tuscan vineyards. The vines at Castagnolo are cultivated in accordance
with the French system, and at the vintage all unripe and unsound grapes
are thrown aside. There is an evident flavour of the muscat grape in the
Castagnolo sparkling wine, which has the merit of lightness and of being
well made. The alcoholic strength is equivalent to rather more than 20°
of proof spirit, and the highest quality wine is remarkable for its
excessive dryness in comparison with all other samples of Italian
sparkling wines that we have met with. Naples appears to confine itself
to producing sparkling white lacryma christi, for which, as a curiosity,
there exists a certain demand.

Spain of late years has shown itself equally ambitious with
202

Italy to achieve distinction in the production of sparkling wines, and
at the Paris Exhibition of 1878 there were samples from the majority of
the wine centres skirting the Mediterranean coast, including Gerona,
Barcelona, Tarragona, and Valencia. Other samples come from Logroño, in
the north of Spain; and years ago sparkling wine used to be made at
Villaviciosa, on the Bay of Biscay. To Paris there were also sent
samples of sparkling orange wine, an agreeable beverage, and
unquestionably preferable to the majority of Spanish sparkling wines
composed of the juice of the grape.

Greek sparkling wines, said to be of very fair quality, are made at
Athens, Corinth, and Tripoliza, and are exported in moderate quantities
to Russia. Algeria, too, is turning its attention to the production of
sparkling wines, but solely for home consumption, and at the Paris
Exhibition there was a sparkling wine from Uruguay, but of execrable
quality.

The sparkling wines of the Crimea and the Don, known in Russia
respectively as Krimski and Donski champagnes, are described as being
superior to much of the wine which passes in England under the name of
champagne. In Russia it is the fashion to speak contemptuously of them,
just as rhubarb and gooseberry champagne is spoken of in England, still
these Crimean and Don products are genuine wines, and, though somewhat
sweet, may be drunk with satisfaction and in moderate quantities with
impunity. One of the best Donski brands is that of Abrahamof, and as
much as six roubles per bottle is demanded for the finer qualities at
Novoi Tscherkash. About a million bottles of the Donski champagne are
exported annually, but the wine finds its principal market at the great
Russian fairs, where almost every important bargain is “wetted” with
sparkling Donski.

From
the earliest period of the colonisation of America the vine appears to
have attracted the attention of the settlers, and
204

it is said that as early as 1564 wine was made from the native grape in
Florida. The first attempts to establish a regular vineyard date,
however, from 1620, and would seem to have been made in Virginia with
European vines, the prospects having become sufficiently encouraging in
1630 for the colonists to send for French vine-dressers to tend their
plants. The latter were subsequently accused of ruining the vines by
their bad treatment, but most likely this was an error, it having since
been made evident that European vines cannot be successfully cultivated
east of the Rocky Mountains, where the phylloxera vastatrix prevails. It
was in vain that William Penn made repeated attempts to acclimatise
European vines in Pennsylvania, that the Swiss
emigrants       vine-growers from the Lake of Geneva       made similar
trials, they having expended ten thousand dollars to no purpose. In
vain, in Jessamine county, Kentucky, Pierre Legaud laboured in the
environs of Philadelphia, and Lakanal, the member of the French
Convention, experimented in Tennessee, Ohio, and Alabama; all their
efforts to introduce the Old World vines proved futile. The attempts
that were made by Swiss settlers at Vevay, in Indiana, with the
indigenous plants were more successful, and after a time they managed to
produce some palatable wine from the Schuylkill muscatel.

Towards the latter part of the 18th century the Mission Fathers had
succeeded in planting vineyards in California. It is known that in 1771
the vine was cultivated there, and the San Gabriel Mission in the county
of Los Angeles, some 300 miles S.E. of San Francisco, is said to have
possessed the first vineyard. A      prevalent belief is, that the vines
were from roots or cuttings obtained from either Spain or Mexico, but it
is also conjectured that they were some of the wild varieties known to
be scattered over the country, while a third theory suggests that as
attempts to make wine from the wild grapes would most likely have proved
a failure, the Fathers planted the seeds of raisins which had come from
Spain. The culture must have progressed rapidly, if, as stated, there
were planted at San Gabriel in a
205

single spring no fewer than 40,000 vines. These mission vines were
mainly of two sorts, the one yielding a white grape with a musky
flavour, and the other a dark blue fruit. The latter was the favourite,
doubtless from its produce bearing some resemblance to the red wines of
Old Castile.

From San Gabriel the planting of the vine extended from mission to
mission until each owned its patch of vineland. At the time of the
arrival of the Americans in 1846 the smallest of these was five acres in
extent, and others as many as thirty acres, and it is calculated the
average yield was from 700 to 1,000 gallons of wine per acre. This was
owing first to the exceeding richness of the soil, and secondly to its
being well irrigated. If the celebrated mission vine grown on one of the
sunny slopes overlooking the lovely Montecito valley near Santa Barbara
on the blue Pacific had many fellows in the Fathers’ vineyards, the
above estimate can hardly be an exaggerated one. The stem of this vine,
which is four feet four inches in circumference at the ground, rises
eight feet before branching out. The branches, under which the country
people are fond of dancing, and which are supported by fifty-two
trellises, extend over more than 5,000 square feet. This monster vine
produces annually from five to six tons of grapes, and one year it
yielded no fewer than 7,000 bunches, each from one to four pounds in
weight. It is irrigated by water from the hot springs, situated a few
miles distant, and is believed to be from half to three-quarters of a
century old.

Viticulture and vinification languished in the United States until
attention was called in 1826 to the catawba vine by Major Adlum, of
Georgetown, near Washington, who thought that by so doing he was
conferring a greater benefit on his country than if he had liquidated
its national debt. This vine, which is derived from the wild Vitis
labrusca, was first planted on an extensive scale by Nicholas
Longworth, justly looked upon as one of the founders of American
viticulture, and gradually supplanted all others, remaining for many
years the principal plant cultivated along the banks of the
Ohio       the so-called
206

“Rhine of America”       until, ceaselessly attacked by rot, mildew, and
leaf-blight, it was found necessary in many places to supplant it by
more robust varieties.

Mr. Longworth, about the year 1837, among his numerous experiments at
Cincinnati, included that of making sparkling wines from the catawba,
isabella, and other varieties of grapes, and to-day there are several
manufactories of sparkling catawba and other wines in the capital of
Ohio       the self-named “Queen city,” which its detractors have
jocularly dubbed Porcopolis on account of the immense trade done there
in smoked and salted pork. The chief sparkling wine establishments at
Cincinnati are those of Messrs. Werk and Sons, whose sparkling catawba
obtained a medal for progress at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873, and who
have, moreover, largely experimented with ives’ and virginia seedlings,
delaware and other grapes, in making effervescent wines, though only
with doubtful success. Another Cincinnati firm is that of Messrs. George
Bogen and Co., whose sparkling wines also met with recognition at
Vienna.

The reader will remember Longfellow’s well-known song extolling
catawba wine, which, with more than a poet’s licence, he ranks above the
best of the Old World vintages:       


“There grows no vine
By the haunted Rhine,

By Danube or Guadalquivir,

Nor on island nor cape,
That bears such a grape

As grows by the Beautiful River.


“Very good in its way
Is the Verzenay,

Or the Sillery, soft and creamy,

But Catawba wine
Has a taste more divine,

More dulcet, delicious, and dreamy.”

On Kelley’s Island, Erie county, also in the State of Ohio,
a      wine company, established in 1866, and trading principally in
still wines, makes sparkling wines upon a considerable scale exclusively
from the catawba variety of grape, which is cultivated in its highest
perfection both on the islands of Lake Erie and along a narrow
207

slip of territory not two miles long bordering the southern shore of the
lake, and also in the vicinity of Lake Keuka, near Hammondsport, N.Y.
The Kelley Island Wine Company, as it is styled, presses the grapes
between the middle of October and the end of November, and bottles from
about the 20th May until the commencement of July in the year following.
Its brands are Island Queen, Nonpareil, and Carte Blanche. Ninety-five
per cent. of the wines are dry, and the tendency of the market is in
favour of a still drier article. Shipments are principally confined to
the United States, the great centre of the trade being St. Louis, on the
Mississippi, which has its own sparkling wine establishments, and to-day
disputes with Chicago the title of Queen of the West. The company keep
some 100,000 bottles of sparkling wines in stock, and possess facilities
for bottling five times that quantity whenever the demand might warrant
such a step being taken. Of recent years, however, economy has been the
rule in American society, and the market for native sparkling wines at
any rate is to-day a reduced one.

At Hammondsport, south of Lake Keuka       in other words, Crooked
Lake       and in the State of New York, the establishments of the
Pleasant Valley and Urbana wine companies, devoting their attention to
both still and sparkling wines, are installed. The region, which
enthusiastic writers now term the Champagne of America, was colonised in
1793, and vines of the catawba and isabella varieties were first planted
for the purpose of making wine in 1854. At the present time there are
about 8,000 acres under cultivation with all the better species of
vines. The produce from black and white grapes is mingled for the
sparkling wines of the district. Of the former but two kinds are
considered suitable, the concord and the isabella, both being varieties
of the indigenous labrusca, or so-called foxy-flavoured grape. The
concord is a hardy and productive plant, producing large and compact
bunches of large round sweet grapes, yielding a wine of the obnoxious
foxy flavour. The isabella is an equally hardy and productive variety,
and its bunches are of good size, although not compact. Its berries,
208

too, are large, oval, and juicy, and marked by a strong musky aroma.

Of the white, or rather pale-coloured grapes       for their hue is
usually a reddish one       used for sparkling wines, the principal is
the catawba, also of the labrusca variety. The branches are large and
tolerably compact; the berries, too, are above the medium size, and have
a rich vinous and pronounced musky flavour. Other so-called white
species of grapes are the diana and the iona, both, of them seedlings of
the catawba; the delaware, the bunches of which are rather small but
compact, the berries round, extremely juicy and fresh-tasting, but sweet
and aromatic, the wine produced from which is noted for its fragrant
bouquet; and, lastly, the walter, a      variety obtained by crossing
the delaware with the diana. The bunches and berries of the walter are
of medium size; the flavour, like that of the delaware, is sweet and
aromatic; and the grape is, moreover, remarkable for its agreeable
bouquet.





The vintage usually commences about the end of September or the
commencement of October, and the grapes, after being carefully sorted,
are run through a small mill, which breaks the
209

skins, and admits of the juice running the more readily out when the
fruit is placed beneath the press. The latter is worked with a metal
screw, and the must is conducted through pipes or hose to casks holding
from two to four thousand gallons each, in which it ferments. During the
following May the wine is carefully blended, and the operation of
bottling commences and lasts for about two or three months. The
newly-bottled wine is at first stored in a warm place in order to start
the fermentation again, and when the bottles commence to burst it is
removed to the subterranean vaults, where it remains stacked in a
horizontal fashion until the time arrives to force the sediment down
upon the corks. This is accomplished precisely as in the Champagne, the
subsequent disgorging and liqueuring being also effected according to
the orthodox French system. Altogether a couple of years elapse between
the epoch of bottling and shipment, and during this interval each bottle
is handled upwards of two hundred times.

The Pleasant Valley Wine Company, established in 1860 for the
commerce of still wines, in which it continues to do an extensive
business, commenced five years later to make sparkling wines. It grows
its own grapes and consumes annually about 1,500 tons of fruit, bottling
from 200,000 to 300,000 bottles of sparkling wine in the course of the
year. Its brands are the Great Western, of which there is a dry and an
extra dry variety, the Carte Blanche, and the Pleasant Valley. Even the
extra dry variety of the first-named wine tastes sweet in comparison
with a moderately dry champagne, in addition to which its flavour,
though agreeable, is certainly too pronounced for a sparkling wine of
high quality. The wines, which secured a medal for progress at the
Vienna Exhibition of 1873, are sold in every city in the United States,
and the company also does a small but increasing trade with England and
South America.

The Urbana Wine Company, also established at Hammondsport at the same
epoch as its rival, deals, like the latter, in still wines as well. It
has three brands       the Gold Seal, of which
210

there is an extra dry variety, the Imperial, and the Royal Rose. At
Vienna a diploma of merit was awarded to these wines, for which a
considerable market is found throughout the United States and in the
West Indies and South America. The Urbana Wine Company produces
excellent sparkling wines of singular lightness and of delicate though
distinctive flavour. In our judgment the drier varieties are greatly to
be preferred. The prices of all the American sparkling wines are
certainly high, being almost equivalent to the price of first-class
champagnes taken at Reims and Epernay.

In California the manufacture of sparkling wines is carried on with
considerable success, and at the Vienna Exhibition the Buena Vista
Vinicultural Society of San Francisco was awarded a medal for progress
for the excellent samples it sent there. The society was originally
organised by Colonel Haraszthy, the pioneer in recent times of
Californian viticulture. It commenced manufacturing sparkling wines with
the assistance of experienced workmen from Epernay and Ay; but the
endeavours, extending over some three or four years, were attended with
but indifferent success, very few cuvées proving of fair quality,
whilst with the majority the wine had to be emptied from the bottles and
distilled into brandy. The son of Colonel Haraszthy subsequently
succeeded, in conjunction with Mr. Isidor Landsberger, of San Francisco,
in discovering the cause of these failures, and for ten years past the
wine has been constantly improving in quality owing to the increased use
of foreign grapes, which yield a vin brut with a delicate bouquet
and flavour approaching in character to the finer champagnes. The wine
is perfectly pure, no flavouring extracts or spirit being employed in
the composition of the liqueur, which, is composed merely of sugar-candy
dissolved in fine old wine. A      French connoisseur pronounces
sparkling Sonoma to be the best of American sparkling wines, “clean and
fresh, tasting, with the flavour of a middle-class Ay growth, as well as
remarkably light and delicate, and possessed of considerable
effervescence.” The Sonoma valley vineyards produce the lightest wines
of all the Californian growths, some
211

of the white varieties indicating merely 15° of proof spirit, and the
red ones no more than 17½°.

The vintage takes place towards the end of October, and the grapes
are gathered by Chinamen, who will each pick his 12 to 14 cwt. of grapes
a day for the wage of a dollar. Light wooden boxes are used for holding
the grapes, which are stripped from their stalks on their arrival at the
press-house, and then partially crushed by a couple of revolving
rollers. An inclined platform beneath receives them, and after the
expressed juice has been run off into cask they are removed to the
press, and the must subsequently extracted is added to that forced out
by the rollers. When white wine is being made from black grapes the
pressure is less continuous, and the must is of course separated at once
from the skins. The fermentation, which is violent for some ten or
twelve hours, ceases in about a fortnight, providing a temperature of
from 70° to 75° Fahr. is maintained in the vaults. The wine is racked at
the new year, and again before the blending and bottling of it in the
spring.

The Californian sparkling wines not only find a market in the eastern
States, but are sent across the Pacific to the Sandwich Islands, Japan,
China, and even to wine-producing Australia, which has not yet succeeded
in producing sparkling wines of its own.

The manufacture of spurious sparkling wines is carried on to some
extent in the United States. The raw wine is cleared by fining it with
albumen or gelatine and with alum; the latter substance imparting to it
great brilliancy. After being dosed with a flavoured syrup the wine is
charged like soda-water with carbonic acid gas by placing the bottles
under a fountain, and as this gas is derived from marble dust and
sulphuric acid, it is liable to be impregnated with both lead and
copper, which have the effect of disorganising alike the wine and the
consumers of it       nausea, headache, and other ills resulting from
drinking sparkling wines made under such conditions.

When
selecting a sparkling wine one fact should be borne in mind       that
just as, according to Sam Weller, it is the seasoning which makes the
pie mutton, beef, or veal, so it is the liqueur which renders the wine
dry or sweet, light or strong. A      really
213

palatable dry champagne, emitting the fragrant bouquet which
distinguishes all wines of fine quality, free from added spirit, is
obliged to be made of the very best vin brut, to which
necessarily an exceedingly small percentage of liqueur will be added. On
the other hand, a      sweet champagne can be produced from the most
ordinary raw wine       the Yankees even claim to have evolved it from
petroleum       as the amount of liqueur it receives completely masks
its original character and flavour. This excess of syrup, it should be
remarked, contributes materially to the wine’s explosive force and
temporary effervescence, but shortly after the bottle has been uncorked
the wine becomes disagreeably flat. A      fine dry wine, indebted as it
is for its sparkling properties to the natural sweetness of the grape,
does not exhibit the same sudden turbulent effervescence. It continues
to sparkle, however, for a long time after being poured into the glass
owing to the carbonic acid having been absorbed by the wine itself
instead of being accumulated in the vacant space between the liquid and
the cork, as is the case with wines that have been highly liqueured.
Even when its carbonic acid gas is exhausted a good champagne will
preserve its fine flavour, which the effervescence will have assisted to
conceal. Champagne, it should be noted, sparkles best in tall tapering
glasses; still these have their disadvantages, promoting as they do an
excess of froth when the wine is poured into them, and almost preventing
any bouquet which the wine possesses from being recognised.

Manufacturers of champagne and other sparkling wines prepare them dry
or sweet, light or strong, according to the markets for which they are
designed. The sweet wines go to Russia and Germany, the sweet-toothed
Muscovite regarding M.      Louis Roederer’s syrupy product as the
beau-idéal of champagne, and the Germans demanding wines with 20
or more per cent. of liqueur, or nearly quadruple the quantity that is
contained in the average champagnes shipped to England. France consumes
light and moderately sweet wines; the United States gives a preference
to the intermediate qualities; China, India, and other hot countries
stipulate for light dry wines; while the very strong
214

ones go to Australia, the Cape, and other places where gold and diamonds
and such-like trifles are from time to time “prospected.” Not merely the
driest but the very best wines of the best manufacturers, and commanding
of course the highest prices, are invariably reserved for the English
market. Foreigners cannot understand the marked preference shown in
England for exceedingly dry sparkling wines. They do not consider that
as a rule they are drunk during dinner with the plats, and not at
dessert, with all kinds of sweets, fruits, and ices, as is almost
invariably the case abroad.

Good champagne is usually of a pale straw colour, but with nothing of
a yellow tinge about it. When its tint is pinkish this is owing to a
portion of the colouring matter having been extracted from the skins of
the grapes       a      contingency which every pains are taken to
avoid, although, since the success achieved by the wine of 1874,
slightly pink wines are likely to be the fashion. The positive pink or
rose-coloured champagnes, such as were in fashion some thirty years ago,
are simply tinted with a small quantity of deep red wine. The alcoholic
strength of the drier wines ranges from 18° of proof spirit upwards, or
slightly above the ordinary Bordeaux, and under all the better-class
Rhine wines. Champagnes when loaded with a highly alcoholized liqueur
will, however, at times mark 30 degrees of proof spirit. The lighter and
drier the sparkling wine the more wholesome it is, the saccharine
element in conjunction with alcohol being not only difficult of
digestion, but generally detrimental to health.

The faculty are agreed that fine dry champagnes are among the safest
wines that can be partaken of. Any intoxicating effects are rapid but
exceedingly transient, and arise from the alcohol suspended in the
carbonic acid being applied rapidly and extensively to the surface of
the stomach. “Champagne,” said Curran, “simply gives a runaway rap at a
man’s head.” Dr. Druitt, equally distinguished by his studies upon wine
and his standing as a physician, pronounces good champagne to be “a true
stimulant to body and mind alike, rapid, volatile, transitory, and
harmless. Amongst the maladies which are benefited by
215

it,” remarks he, “is the true neuralgia, intermitting fits of
excruciating pain running along certain nerves, without inflammation of
the affected part, often a consequence of malaria, or of some other low
and exhausting causes. To enumerate the cases in which champagne is of
service would be to give a whole nosology. Who does not know the misery,
the helplessness of that abominable ailment, influenza, whether a severe
cold or the genuine epidemic? Let the faculty dispute about the best
remedy if they please; but a sensible man with a bottle of champagne
will beat them all. Moreover, whenever there is pain, with exhaustion
and lowness, then Dr. Champagne should be had up. There is something
excitant in the wine; doubly so in the sparkling wine, which the moment
it touches the lips sends an electric telegram of comfort to every
remote nerve. Nothing comforts and rests the stomach better, or is a
greater antidote to nausea.”

Champagne of fine quality should never be mixed with ice or iced
water; neither should it be iced to the extent champagnes ordinarily
are, for, in the first place, the natural lightness of the wine is such
as not to admit of its being diluted without utterly spoiling it, and in
the next, excessive cold destroys alike the fragrant bouquet of the wine
and its delicate vinous flavour. Really good champagne should not be
iced below a temperature of 50° Fahr., whereas exceedingly sweet wines
will bear icing down almost to freezing point, and be rendered more
palatable by the process. The above remarks apply to all kinds of
sparkling wine.

In the Champagne what may be termed a really grand vintage commonly
occurs only once, and never more than twice, in ten years. During the
same period, however, there will generally be one or two other tolerably
good vintages. In grand years the crop, besides being of superior
quality, is usually abundant, and as a consequence the price of the raw
wine is scarcely higher than usual. Apparently from this circumstance
the sparkling wine of grand vintages does not command an enhanced value,
as is the case with other fine wines. It is only when speculators
recklessly outbid each other for the grapes or
216

the vin brut, or when stocks are low and the vin brut is
really scarce, that the price of champagne appears to rise.

That superior quality does not involve enhanced price is proved by
the amounts paid for the Ay and Verzenay crûs in years of grand
vintages. During the present century these appear to have been 1802,
’06, ’11, ’18, ’22, ’25, ’34, ’42, ’46, ’57, ’65, ’68, and
’74       that is, thirteen grand vintages in nearly eighty years. Other
good vintages, although not equal to the foregoing, occurred in the
years 1815, ’32, ’39, ’52, ’54, ’58, ’62, ’64, and ’70. Confining
ourselves to the grand years, we find that the Ay wine of 1834, owing to
the crop being plentiful as well as good, only realised from 110 to 140
francs the pièce of 44 gallons, although for two years previously this
had fetched from 150 to 200 francs. In 1842 the price ranged from 120 to
150 francs, whereas the vastly inferior wine of the year before had
commanded from 210 to 275 francs. In 1846, the crop being a small one,
the price of the wine rose, and in 1857 the pièce fetched as much as
from 480 to 500 francs, still this was merely a trifle higher than it
had realised the two preceding years. In 1865 the price was 380 to 400
francs, and in 1868 about the same, whereas the indifferent vintages of
1871, ’72, and ’73 realised from 500 to 1,000 francs the pièce. It was
very similar with the wine of Verzenay. In 1834 the price of the pièce
ranged from 280 to 325 francs, or about the average of the three
preceding years. In 1846, the crop being scarce, the price rose
considerably, while in 1857, when the crop was plentiful, it fell to 500
francs, or from 5 to 20 per cent. below that of the two previous years,
when the yield was both inferior and less abundant. In 1865 the price
rose 33 per cent. above that of the year before; still, although
Verzenay wine of 1865 and 1868 fetched from 420 to 450 francs the pièce,
and that of 1874 as much as 900 francs, the greatly inferior vintages of
1872-73 commanded 900 and 1,030 francs the pièce.

Consumers of champagne, if wise, would profit by the circumstance
that quality has not the effect of causing a rise in prices, and if they
were bent upon drinking their favourite wine in perfection,
217

as one meets with it at the dinner-tables of the principal
manufacturers, who only put old wine of grand vintages before their
guests, they would lay down champagnes of good years in the same way as
the choicer vintages of port, burgundy, and bordeaux are laid down.
Champagne of 1874 was a wine of this description, with all its finer
vinous qualities well developed, and consequently needing age to attain
not merely the roundness but the refinement of flavour pertaining to a
high-class sparkling wine. Instead of being drunk a few months after it
was shipped in the spring and summer of 1877, as was the fate of much of
the wine in question, it needed being kept for three years at the very
least to become even moderately round and perfect. In the Champagne one
had many opportunities of tasting the grander vintages that had arrived
at ten, twelve, or fifteen years of age, and had thereby attained
supreme excellence. It is true their effervescence had moderated
materially, but their bouquet and flavour were perfect, and their
softness and delicacy something marvellous.





A great wine like that of 1874 will go on improving for ten years,
providing it is only laid down under proper conditions. These are,
first, an exceedingly cool but perfectly dry cellar, the temperature of
which should be as low as from 50° to 55° Fahr., or even lower if this
is practicable. The cellar, too, should be neither over dark nor light,
scrupulously clean, and sufficiently well ventilated for the air to be
continuously pure. It is requisite that the bottles should rest on their
sides to prevent the corks shrinking, and thus allowing both the
carbonic acid and the wine itself to escape. For laying down champagne
or any kind of sparkling wine an iron wine-bin is by far the best.
I      much prefer the patent “slider” bins made by Messrs.
W.      and      J. Burrow, of Malvern, they being better adapted to the
purpose than any other I am acquainted with. In these the bottles rest
on horizontal parallel bars of wrought-iron, securely riveted into
strong wrought-iron uprights, both at the back and in front. The bins
can be obtained of any size       that is, to hold as few as two or as
many as forty dozen       and they
218

can be had furnished with lattice doors, secured by a lock. One great
advantage is that with them there is no waste of space, for individual
compartments can be at once refilled with fresh bottles after the other
bottles have been removed. These “slider” bins are especially adapted
for laying down champagne, as they admit of the air circulating freely
around the bottles, thus conducing to the preservation of the metal foil
round their necks, and keeping the temperature of the wine both cool and
equable.






WINE-CELLAR FITTED WITH BURROW’S PATENT SLIDER BINS.

When binning the wine the bottles are held by their necks and slid
into their places with such ease and safety that a child might be
entrusted with the work. The bottles can be withdrawn from the bin with
equal or even greater facility. Breakage is avoided from each bottle
having an independent bearing, which prevents the upper bottles from
either falling
219

or weighing down upon those below, and thereby crashing together. The
larger engraving shows a wine-cellar fitted up entirely with. Burrow’s
patent “slider” wine-bins, while the smaller represents a bin adapted to
laying down twenty dozens of champagne, and the dimensions of which are
merely 5      feet 8      inches by 3      feet.

From the subjoined table it will be seen that the consumption
220

of champagne has almost trebled since the year 1844-5, a      period of
little more than thirty years. Another curious fact to note is the
immense increase in the exports of the wine during the three years
following the Franco-German war, when naturally both the exports and
home consumption of champagne fell off very considerably. No reliable
information is available as to the actual quantity of champagne consumed
yearly in England, but this may be taken in round numbers at about four
millions of bottles. The consumption of the wine in the United States
varies from rather more than a million and a half to nearly two million
bottles annually.

Distinguished gourmets are scarcely agreed as to the proper moment
when champagne should be introduced at the dinner-table. Dyspeptic Mr.
Walker, of “The Original,” laid it down that champagne ought to be
introduced very early at the banquet, without any regard whatever to the
viands it may chance to accompany. “Give champagne,” he says, “at the
beginning of dinner, as its exhilarating qualities serve to start the
guests, after which they will seldom flag. No other wine produces an
equal effect in increasing the success of a party       it invariably
turns the balance to the favourable side. When champagne goes rightly
nothing can well go wrong.” These precepts are sound enough, still all
dinner-parties are not necessarily glacial, and the guests are not
invariably mutes. Before champagne can be properly introduced at a
formal dinner the conventional glass of sherry or madeira should
supplement the soup, a      white French or a Rhine wine accompany the
fish, and a single glass of bordeaux prepare the way with the first
entrée for the sparkling wine, which, for the first round or two,
should be served, briskly and liberally. A      wine introduced thus
early at the repast should of course be dry, or, at any rate,
moderately      so.

We certainly do not approve of Mr. Charles Dickens’s dictum that
champagne’s proper place is not at the dinner-table, but solely at a
ball. “A      cavalier,” he said, “may appropriately offer at propitious
intervals a glass now and then to his danceress. There it takes its
fitting rank and position amongst feathers, gauzes,
221

lace, embroidery, ribbons, white satin, shoes, and eau-de-Cologne, for
champagne is simply one of the elegant extras of life.” This is all very
well, still the advantageous effect of sparkling wine at an ordinary
British dinner-party, composed as it frequently is of people pitchforked
together in accordance with the exigencies of the hostess’s
visiting-list, cannot be <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "spelling unchanged">gainsayed.
After the preliminary glowering at each
other, more Britannico, in the drawing-room, everybody regards it
as a relief to be summoned to the repast, which, however, commences as
chillily as the soup and as stolidly as the salmon. The soul of the
hostess is heavy with the anxiety of prospective dishes, the brow of the
host is clouded with the reflection that our rulers are bent upon
dragging us into war. Placed between a young lady just out and a dowager
of grimly Gorgonesque aspect, you hesitate how to open a conversation.
Your first attempts, like those of the Russian batteries on the Danube,
are singularly ineffectual, only eliciting a dropping fire of
monosyllables. You envy the placidly languid young gentleman opposite,
limp as his fast-fading camellia, and seated next to Belle Breloques,
who is certain, in racing parlance, to make the running for him. But
even that damsel seems preoccupied with her fan, and, despite her
aplomb, hesitates to break the icy silence. The two City friends
of the host are lost in mute speculation as to the future price of
indigo or Ionian Bank shares, while their wives seem to be mentally
summarising the exact cost of each other’s toilettes. Their daughters,
or somebody else’s daughters, are desperately jerking out monosyllabic
responses to feeble remarks concerning the weather, lawn tennis,
operatic débutantes, the gravel in the Row, the ill-health of the
Princess, and kindred topics from a couple of F.O. men. Little Snapshot,
the wit, on the other side of the Gorgon, has tried to lead up to a
story, but has found himself, as it were, frozen in the bud. When lo!
the butler softly sibillates in your ear the magic word “champagne,” and
as it flows, creaming and frothing, into your glass, a      change comes
over the spirit of your vision.

The hostess brightens, the host coruscates. The young lady
222

on your right suddenly develops into a charming girl, with becoming
appreciation of your pet topics and an astounding aptness for repartee.
The Gorgon thaws, and implores Mr. Snapshot, whose jests are popping as
briskly as the corks, not to be so dreadfully funny, or he will
positively kill her. Belle Breloques can always talk, and now her tongue
rattles faster than ever, till the languid one arouses himself like a
giant refreshed, and gives her as good as he gets. The City men
expatiate in cabalistic language on the merits of some mysterious
speculation, the prospective returns from which increase with each fresh
bottle. One of their wives is discussing the E.C.U. and the S.S.C. with
a hitherto silent curate, and the other is jabbering botany to a
red-faced warrior. The juniors are in full swing, and ripples of silvery
laughter rise in accompaniment to the beaded bubbles all round the
table. And all this is due to champagne, that great unloosener not
merely of tongues but of purse-strings, as is well known to the
secretaries of those charitable institutions which set the wine flowing
earliest at their anniversary dinners.



A few recipes for sparkling
wine cups gathered from various sources will conclude our work. Not
having personally tested these we leave the responsibility of them to
their respective authors       Soyer, Tovey, Terrington (“Cooling Cups
and Dainty Drinks”),      c.       premising that it is the merest folly
to use a high-class champagne or a fine sparkling hock for a beverage of
this description. Sparkling saumur, or the newly-introduced sparkling
sauternes, and the cheaper hocks and moselles, will do equally well at a
greatly reduced cost. In all cases, too, the kind of liqueur, the amount
of sugar, and the flavouring with borage, verbena, pine-apple, or
cucumber, may be varied to suit individual tastes. For soda or seltzer
water we have invariably substituted Apollinaris, which is far better
adapted for effervescent drinks of this description by reason of its
purity and softness, its freedom from any distinct flavour, and above
all its powerful natural effervescence.

223

Soyer’s elaborate recipe for champagne cup for a large party is as
follows:       


Prepare three ounces of oleo-saccharine by rubbing some lumps of sugar
against the outside of a lemon or Seville orange and scraping away the
sugar as it absorbs the essential oil contained in the rind of the
fruit. Put the oleo-saccharine with the juice of four lemons in a
vessel, add a quart bottle of Apollinaris water (Soyer says soda-water,
but Apollinaris is certainly preferable), and stir well together until
the sugar is dissolved. Then pour in one quart of syrup of orgeat and
whip the mixture up well with an egg whisk in order to whiten it. Next
add a pint of cognac brandy, a      quarter of a pint of Jamaica rum and
half a pint of maraschino; strain the whole into a bowl, adding plenty
of pounded ice if the weather is warm, and pour in three bottles of
champagne, stirring the mixture well with the ladle while doing so in
order to render the cup creamy and mellow.

A less potent and pretentious beverage, and better suited for a
summer drink, is the subjoined:       


Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar in a quart of Apollinaris
water. Add a wineglass of <ins class = "mycorr"
title = "spelling unchanged">curaçoa,
a sprig of green borage or a couple of slices
of cucumber with the juice and fine shavings of the outside peel of a
lemon, and a pound of bruised ice. After the whole has been well stirred
pour in the champagne and serve.

Other recipes are as follows:       


Prepare an ounce of oleo-saccharine, add to it a large wineglass of
maraschino, a      liqueur glass of cognac, and the juice of half a
lemon. Mix well together, and add several slices of pine-apple, and a
large lump or two of ice. On to this pour first a large bottle of
Apollinaris water, and next a bottle of sparkling wine.


Mix with the contents of a bottle of chablis or sauternes a liqueur
glass of chartreuse and a tablespoonful or two of powdered loaf sugar.
When the latter is dissolved throw in a pound and a half of pounded ice
and a sprig of borage. Pour over these a quart of Apollinaris water and
a bottle of sparkling saumur. For the chablis or sauternes half a bottle
of light claret may be substituted.


To a gill of good pale sherry add a liqueur glass of maraschino and a
few lumps of sugar which have been well rubbed over the rind of a
Seville orange, the juice of which is also to be added to the mixture.
After the sugar is dissolved throw in a sprig of borage or a slice or
two of cucumber and some pounded ice. Then add a quart bottle of
Apollinaris water and a bottle of champagne or some other sparkling
wine.

The following cup for a party of twenty is said to be of Russian
inspiration:       


Pour on to some sprigs of borage or a few slices of cucumber a pint of
sherry and half a pint of brandy, then rub off the fine outside peel of
a lemon with a few lumps of sugar, and add these with the strained juice
of the lemon and of three oranges. Pour into the mixture half a pint of
curaçoa,
a      wineglass of noyau, a      couple of bottles of German
seltzer-water, three bottles of soda-water, and three bottles of
champagne. Sweeten and ice to taste.

224

Here is a recipe for a cup made with chablis and sparkling red
burgundy:       


With a bottle of chablis mix a liqueur-glass of chartreuse and then
dissolve in it some powdered sugar. Add two pounds of ice in largish
lumps, a      slice or two of cucumber, and a sprig of lemon-scented
verbena, or substitute for these a few slices of pine-apple. Pour in a
quart bottle of Apollinaris water, mix well together, and add a bottle
of sparkling burgundy just before serving.

The following refer to sparkling hock and moselle cups:       


To a bottle of sparkling hock add a quarter of a pint of lemon water ice
and a liqueur glass of pine-apple syrup. After mixing them add a slice
of cucumber, a      lump or two of ice, and a bottle of Apollinaris
water.


Add to the strained juice of a couple of lemons an ounce and a half or
more of powdered loaf sugar and a wineglass of maraschino. Mix well, and
pour in a couple of bottles of iced sparkling hock and a large bottle of
iced Apollinaris water.


Dissolve a couple of ounces of sugar in a gill of dry sherry, add the
thin peel of half an orange, a      few slices of pine-apple, peaches,
or apricots, with some pounded ice, and then pour in a bottle of
sparkling moselle and a bottle of Apollinaris water.


With half a pint of lemon water ice mix a bottle of iced sparkling
moselle, add a few drops of elder-flower water and a bottle of iced
Apollinaris water. Instead of the lemon ice half the quantity of
pine-apple ice may be used with the juice of half a lemon, and the
elder-flower water may be dispensed with.

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
