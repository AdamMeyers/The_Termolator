COMMENTARY ON PLATES 45 &amp; 46.<br>
<br>
DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF FEMORAL HERNIA--<br>
ITS DIAGNOSIS, THE TAXIS, AND THE OPERATION.<br>
<br>
PLATE 45, Fig. 1.--The point, 3, from which an external inguinal hernia<br>
first progresses, and the part, 5, within which the femoral hernia<br>
begins to be formed, are very close to each other. The inguinal hernia,<br>
3, arising above, 5, the crural arch, descends the canal, 3, 3, under<br>
cover of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, obliquely<br>
downwards and inwards till it gains the external abdominal ring formed<br>
in the aponeurosis, and thence descends to the scrotum. The femoral<br>
hernia, commencing on a level with, 5, the femoral arch, descends the<br>
femoral canal, under cover of the fascia lata, and appears on the upper<br>
and forepart of the thigh at the saphenous opening, 6, 7, formed in the<br>
fascia lata; and thence, instead of descending to the scrotum, like the<br>
inguinal hernia, turns, on the contrary, up over the falciform process,<br>
6, till its fundus rests near, 5, the very place beneath which it<br>
originated. Such are the peculiarities in the courses of these two<br>
hernial; and they are readily accounted for by the anatomical relations<br>
of the parts concerned.<br>
<br>

PLATE 45.--FIGURE 1<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 45, Fig. 2.--There exists a very evident analogy between the<br>
canals through which both herniae pass. The infundibuliform fascia, 3,<br>
3, of the spermatic vessels is like the infundibuliform sheath, 9, 9, of<br>
the femoral vessels. Both sheaths are productions of the general fibrous<br>
membrane of the abdomen. They originate from nearly the same locality.<br>
The ring of the femoral canal, 12, is situated immediately below, but to<br>
the inner side of the internal inguinal ring, 3. The epigastric artery,<br>
1, marks the width of the interval which separates the two rings.<br>
Poupart's ligament, 5, being the line of union between the oblique<br>
aponeurosis of the abdominal muscle and the fascia lata, merely<br>
overarches the femoral sheath, and does not separate it absolutely from<br>
the spermatic sheath.<br>
<br>

PLATE 45.--FIGURE 2<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 45, Fig. 3.--The peritonaeum, 2, 3, closes the femoral canal, 12,<br>
at the femoral ring, in the same way as this membrane closes the<br>
inguinal canal at the internal inguinal ring, 3, Fig. 2, Plate 45. The<br>
epigastric artery always holds an intermediate position between both<br>
rings. The spermatic vessels in the inguinal tube, 3, 3, Fig. 2, Plate<br>
45, are represented by the round ligament in the female inguinal canal,<br>
Fig. 3, Plate 45. When the bowel is about to protrude at either of the<br>
rings, it first dilates the peritonaeum, which covers these openings.<br>
<br>

PLATE 45.--FIGURE 3<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 45, Fig. 4.--The place of election for the formation of any hernia<br>
is that which is structurally the weakest. As the space which the<br>
femoral arch spans external to the vessels is fully occupied by the<br>
psoas and iliacus muscles, and, moreover, as the abdominal fibrous<br>
membrane and its prolongation, the femoral sheath, closely embrace the<br>
vessels on their outer anterior and posterior sides, whilst on their<br>
inner side the membrane and sheath are removed at a considerable<br>
interval from the vessels, it is through this interval (the canal) that<br>
the hernia may more readily pass. The peritonaeum, 2, and crural septum,<br>
13, form at this place the only barrier against the protrusion of the<br>
bowel into the canal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="images/104P45F4_25.jpg"><img alt=""

 style="border: 2px solid ; width: 569px; height: 637px;"></a><br>
PLATE 45.--FIGURE 4<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 45, Fig. 5.--The hernia cannot freely enter the compartment, 10,<br>
occupied by the artery, neither can it enter the place 11, occupied as<br>
it is by the vein. It cannot readily pass through the inguinal wall at a<br>
point internal to, 9, the crural sheath, for here it is opposed by, 4,<br>
the conjoined tendon, and by, 8, Gimbernat's ligament. Neither will the<br>
hernia force a way at a point external to the femoral vessels in<br>
preference to that of the crural canal, which is already prepared to<br>
admit it. [Footnote] The bowel, therefore, enters the femoral canal, 9,<br>
and herein it lies covered by its peritonaeal sac, derived from that<br>
part of the membrane which once masked the crural ring. The septum<br>
crurale itself, having been dilated before the sac, of course invests it<br>
also. The femoral canal forms now the third covering of the bowel. If in<br>
this stage of the hernia it should suffer constriction, Gimbernat's<br>
ligament, 8, is the cause of it. An incipient femoral hernia of the size<br>
of 2, 12, cannot, in the undissected state of the parts, be detected by<br>
manual operation; for, being bound down by the dense fibrous structures<br>
which gird the canal, it forms no apparent tumour in the groin.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: The mode in which the femoral sheath, continued from the<br>
abdominal membrane, becomes simply applied to the sides of the vessels,<br>
renders it of course not impossible for a hernia to protrude into the<br>
sheath at any point of its abdominal entrance. Mr. Stanley and M.<br>
Cloquet have observed a femoral hernia external to the vessels.<br>
Hesselbach has also met with this variety. A hernia of this nature has<br>
come under my own observation. Cloquet has seen the hernia descend the<br>
sheath <span style="font-style: italic;">once </span>in front of the
vessels, and <span style="font-style: italic;">once</span> behind
them. These<br>
varieties, however, must be very rare. The external form has never been<br>
met with by Hey, Cooper, or Scarpa; whilst no less than six instances of<br>
it have come under the notice of Mr. Macilwain, (on Hernia, p. 293.)]<br>

PLATE 45.--FIGURE 5<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 45, Fig. 6.--The hernia, 2, 12, increasing gradually in size,<br>
becomes tightly impacted in the crural canal, and being unable to dilate<br>
this tube uniformly to a size corresponding with its own volume, it at<br>
length bends towards the saphenous opening, 6, 7, this being the more<br>
easy point of egress. Still, the neck of the sac, 2, remains constricted<br>
at the ring, whilst the part which occupies the canal is also very much<br>
narrowed. The fundus of the sac, 9*, 12, alone expands, as being free of<br>
the canal; and covering this part of the hernia may be seen the fascia<br>
propria, 9*. This fascia is a production of the inner wall of the canal;<br>
and if we trace its sides, we shall find its lower part to be continuous<br>
with the femoral sheath, whilst its upper part is still continuous with<br>
the fascia transversalis. When the hernia ruptures the saphenous side of<br>
the canal, the fascia propria is, of course, absent.<br>
<br>

PLATE 45.--FIGURE 6<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 46, Fig. 1.--The anatomical circumstances which serve for the<br>
diagnosis of a femoral from an inguinal hernia may be best explained by<br>
viewing in contrast the respective positions assumed by both complaints.<br>
The direct hernia, 13, traverses the inguinal wall from behind, at a<br>
situation corresponding with the external ring; and from this latter<br>
point it descends the scrotum. An oblique external inguinal hernia<br>
enters the internal ring, 3, which exists further apart from the general<br>
median line, and, in order to gain the external ring, has to take an<br>
oblique course from without inwards through the inguinal canal. A<br>
femoral hernia enters the crural ring, 2, immediately below, but on the<br>
inner side of, the internal inguinal ring, and descends the femoral<br>
canal, 12, vertically to where it emerges through, 6, 7, the saphenous<br>
opening. The direct inguinal hernia, 13, owing to its form and position,<br>
can scarcely ever be mistaken for a femoral hernia. But in consequence<br>
of the close relationship between the internal inguinal ring, 3, and the<br>
femoral ring, 2, through which their respective herniae pass, some<br>
difficulty in distinguishing between these complaints may occur. An<br>
incipient femoral hernia, occupying the crural canal between the points,<br>
2, 12, presents no apparent tumour in the undissected state of the<br>
parts; and a bubonocele, or incipient inguinal hernia, occupying the<br>
inguinal canal, 3, 3, where it is braced down by the external oblique<br>
aponeurosis, will thereby be also obscured in some degree. But, in most<br>
instances, the bubonocele distends the inguinal canal somewhat; and the<br>
impulse which on coughing is felt at a place above the femoral arch,<br>
will serve to indicate, by negative evidence, that it is not a femoral<br>
hernia.<br>
<br>

PLATE 46.--FIGURE 1<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 46, Fig. 2.--When the inguinal and femoral herniae are fully<br>
produced, they best explain their distinctive nature. The inguinal<br>
hernia, 13, descends the scrotum, whilst the femoral hernia, 9*, turns<br>
over the falciform process, 6, and rests upon the fascia lata and<br>
femoral arch. Though in this position the fundus of a femoral hernia<br>
lies in the neighbourhood of the inguinal canal, 3, yet the swelling can<br>
scarcely be mistaken for an inguinal rupture, since, in addition to its<br>
being superficial to the aponeurosis which covers the inguinal canal,<br>
and also to the femoral arch, it may be withdrawn readily from this<br>
place, and its body, 12, traced to where it sinks into the saphenous<br>
opening, 6, 7, on the upper part of the thigh. An inguinal hernia<br>
manifests its proper character more and more plainly as it advances from<br>
its point of origin to its termination in the scrotum. A femoral hernia,<br>
on the contrary, masks its proper nature, as well at its point of origin<br>
as at its termination. But when a femoral hernia stands midway between<br>
these two, points--viz. in the saphenous opening, 6, 7, it best exhibits<br>
its special character; for here it exists below the femoral arch, and<br>
considerably apart from the external abdominal ring.<br>
<br>

PLATE 46.--FIGURE 2<br>
<br>
<br>
PLATE 46, Fig. 3.--The neck of the sac of a femoral hernia, 2, lies<br>
always close to, 3, the epigastric artery. When the obturator artery is<br>
derived from the epigastric, if the former pass internal to the neck<br>
behind, 8, Gimbernat's ligament, it can scarcely escape being wounded<br>
when this structure is being severed by the operator's knife. If, on the<br>
other hand, the obturator artery descend external to the neck of the<br>
sac, the vessel will be comparatively remote from danger while the<br>
ligament is being divided. In addition to the fact that the cause of<br>
stricture is always on the pubic side, 8, of the neck of the sac, 12,<br>
thereby requiring the incision to correspond with this situation only,<br>
other circumstances, such as the constant presence of the femoral vein,<br>
11, and the epigastric artery, 1, determine the avoidance of ever<br>
incising the canal on its outer or upper side. And if the obturator<br>
artery, [Footnote] by rare occurrence, happen to loop round the inner<br>
side of the neck of the sac, supposing this to be the seat of stricture,<br>
what amount of anatomical knowledge, at the call of the most dexterous<br>
operator, can render the vessel safe from danger?<br>
<br>
[Footnote: M. Velpeau (Medecine Operatoire), in reference to the<br>
relative frequency of cases in which the obturator artery is derived<br>
from the epigastric, remarks, "L'examen que j'ai pu en faire sur<br>
plusieurs milliers de cadavres, ne me permet pas de dire qu'elle se<br>
rencontre un fois sur trois, ni sur cinq, ni meme sur dix, mais bien<br>
seulement sur quinze a vingt." Monro (Obs. on Crural Hernia) states this<br>
condition of the obturator artery to be as 1 in 20-30. Mr. Quain<br>
(Anatomy of the Arteries) gives, as the result of his observations, the<br>
proportion to be as 1 in 3-1/2, and in this estimate he agrees to a<br>
great extent with the observations of Cloquet and Hesselbach. Numerical<br>
tables have also been drawn up to show the relative frequency in which<br>
the obturator descends on the outer and inner borders of the crural ring<br>
and neck of the sac. Sir A. Cooper never met with an example where the<br>
vessel passed on the inner side of the sac, and from this alone it may<br>
be inferred that such a position of the vessel is very rare. It is<br>
generally admitted that the obturator artery, when derived from the<br>
epigastric, passes down much more frequently between the iliac vein and<br>
outer border of the ring. The researches of anatomists (Monro and<br>
others) in reference to this point have given rise to the question,<br>
"What determines the position of the obturator artery with respect to<br>
the femoral ring?" It appears to me to be one of those questions which<br>
do not admit of a precise answer by any mode of mathematical<br>
computation; and even if it did, where then is the practical inference?]<br>
<br>
The taxis, in a case of crural hernia, should be conducted in accordance<br>
with anatomical principles. The fascia lata, Poupart's ligament, and the<br>
abdominal aponeurosis, are to be relaxed by bending the thigh inwards to<br>
the hypogastrium. By this measure, the falciform process, 6, is also<br>
relaxed; but I doubt whether the situation occupied by Gimbernat's<br>
ligament allows this part to be influenced by any position of the limb<br>
or abdomen. The hernia is then to be drawn from its place above<br>
Poupart's ligament, (if it have advanced so far,) and when brought<br>
opposite the saphenous opening, gentle pressure made outwards, upwards,<br>
and backwards, so as to slip it beneath the margin of the falciform<br>
process, will best serve for its reduction. When this cannot be effected<br>
by the taxis, and the stricture still remains, the cutting operation is<br>
required.<br>
<br>
The precise seat of the stricture cannot be known except during the<br>
operation. But it is to be presumed that the sac and contained intestine<br>
suffer constriction throughout the whole length of the canal. [Footnote]<br>
Previously to the commencement of the operation, the urinary bladder<br>
should be emptied; for this organ, in its distended state, rises above<br>
the level of the pubic bone, and may thus be endangered by the incision<br>
through the stricture--especially if Gimbernat's ligament be the<br>
structure which causes it.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: "The seat of the stricture is not the same in all cases,<br>
though, in by far the greater number of instances, the constriction is<br>
relieved by the division upwards and inwards of the falciform process of<br>
the fascia lata, and the lunated edge of Gimbernat's ligament, where<br>
they join with each other. In some instances, it will be the fibres of<br>
the deep crescentic (femoral) arch; in others, again, the neck of the<br>
sac itself, and produced by a thickening and contraction of the<br>
subserous and peritonaeal membranes where they lie within the<br>
circumference of the crural ring."--<span style="font-style: italic;">Morton
</span>(Surgical Anatomy of the<br>
Groin p. 148).]<br>
<br>
An incision commencing a little way above Poupart's ligament, is to be<br>
carried vertically over the hernia, parallel with, but to the inner side<br>
of its median line. This incision divides the skin and subcutaneous<br>
adipose membrane, which latter varies considerably in quantity in<br>
several individuals. One or two small arteries (superficial pubic,
&amp;c.)<br>
may be divided, and some lymphatic bodies exposed. On cautiously turning<br>
aside the incised adipose membrane contained between the two layers of<br>
the superficial fascia, the fascia propria, 9, Figs. 4, 5, Plate 46, of<br>
the hernia is exposed. This envelope, besides varying in thickness in<br>
two or more cases, may be absent altogether. The fascia closely invests<br>
the sac, 12; but sometimes a layer of fatty substance interposes between<br>
the two coverings, and resembles the omentum so much, that the operator<br>
may be led to doubt whether or not the sac has been already opened. The<br>
fascia is to be cautiously slit open on a director; and now the sac<br>
comes in view. The hernia having been drawn outwards, so as to separate<br>
it from the inner wall of the crural canal, a director [Footnote] is<br>
next to be passed along the interval thus left, the groove of the<br>
instrument being turned to the pubic side. The position of the director<br>
is now between the neck of the sac and the inner wall of the canal. The<br>
extent to which the director passes up in the canal will vary according<br>
to the suspected level of the stricture. A probe-pointed bistoury is now<br>
to be slid along the director, and with its edge turned upwards and<br>
inwards, according to the seat of stricture, the following mentioned<br>
parts are to be divided--viz., the falciform process, 6; the inner wall<br>
of the canal, which is continuous with the fascia propria, 9;<br>
Gimbernat's ligament, 8; and the conjoined tendon, 4; where this is<br>
inserted with the ligament into the pectineal ridge. By this mode of<br>
incision, which seems to be all-sufficient for the liberation of the<br>
stricture external to the neck of the sac, we avoid Poupart's ligament;<br>
and thereby the spermatic cord, 3, and epigastric artery, 1, are not<br>
endangered. The crural canal being thus laid open on its inner side, and<br>
the constricting fibrous bands being severed, the sac may now be gently<br>
manipulated, so as to restore it and its contents to the cavity of the<br>
abdomen; but if any impediment to the reduction still remain, the cause,<br>
in all probability, arises either from the neck of the sac having become<br>
strongly adherent to the crural ring, or from the bowel being bound by<br>
bands of false membrane to the sac. In either case, it will be necessary<br>
to open the sac, and examine its contents. The neck of the sac is then<br>
to be exposed by an incision carried through the integument across the<br>
upper end of the first incision, and parallel with Poupart's ligament.<br>
The neck is then to be divided on its inner side, and the exposed<br>
intestine may now be restored to the abdomen.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: The finger is the safest director; for at the same time that<br>
it guides the knife it feels the stricture and protects the bowel. As<br>
all the structures which are liable to become the seat of<br>
stricture--viz., the falciform process, Gimbernat's ligament, and the<br>
conjoined tendon, lie in very close apposition, a very short incision<br>
made upwards and inwards is all that is required.]<br>
