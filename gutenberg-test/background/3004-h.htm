    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. PRESIDENT JEFFERSON'S COURT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rumble of President John Adams's coach had hardly died away in the
      distance on the morning of March 4,1801, when Mr. Thomas Jefferson entered
      the breakfast room of Conrad's boarding house on Capitol Hill, where he
      had been living in bachelor's quarters during his Vice-Presidency. He took
      his usual seat at the lower end of the table among the other boarders,
      declining with a smile to accept the chair of the impulsive Mrs. Brown,
      who felt, in spite of her democratic principles, that on this day of all
      days Mr. Jefferson should have the place which he had obstinately refused
      to occupy at the head of the table and near the fireplace. There were
      others besides the wife of the Senator from Kentucky who felt that Mr.
      Jefferson was carrying equality too far. But Mr. Jefferson would not take
      precedence over the Congressmen who were his fellow boarders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conrad's was conveniently near the Capitol, on the south side of the hill,
      and commanded an extensive view. The slope of the hill, which was a wild
      tangle of verdure in summer, debouched into a wide plain extending to the
      Potomac. Through this lowland wandered a little stream, once known as
      Goose Creek but now dignified by the name of Tiber. The banks of the
      stream as well as of the Potomac were fringed with native flowering shrubs
      and graceful trees, in which Mr. Jefferson took great delight. The
      prospect from his drawing-room windows, indeed, quite as much as anything
      else, attached him to Conrad's.
    </p>
    <p>
      As was his wont, Mr. Jefferson withdrew to his study after breakfast and
      doubtless ran over the pages of a manuscript which he had been preparing
      with some care for this Fourth of March. It may be guessed, too, that
      here, as at Monticello, he made his usual observations-noting in his diary
      the temperature, jotting down in the garden-book which he kept for thirty
      years an item or two about the planting of vegetables, and recording, as
      he continued to do for eight years, the earliest and latest appearance of
      each comestible in the Washington market. Perhaps he made a few notes
      about the "seeds of the cymbling (cucurbita vermeosa) and squash
      (cucurbita melopipo)" which he purposed to send to his friend Philip
      Mazzei, with directions for planting; or even wrote a letter full of
      reflections upon bigotry in politics and religion to Dr. Joseph Priestley,
      whom he hoped soon to have as his guest in the President's House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward noon Mr. Jefferson stepped out of the house and walked over to the
      Capitol&mdash;a tall, rather loose-jointed figure, with swinging stride,
      symbolizing, one is tempted to think, the angularity of the American
      character. "A tall, large-boned farmer," an unfriendly English observer
      called him. His complexion was that of a man constantly exposed to the sun&mdash;sandy
      or freckled, contemporaries called it&mdash;but his features were
      clean-cut and strong and his expression was always kindly and benignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from salvos of artillery at the hour of twelve, the inauguration of
      Mr. Jefferson as President of the United States was marked by extreme
      simplicity. In the Senate chamber of the unfinished Capitol, he was met by
      Aaron Burr, who had already been installed as presiding officer, and
      conducted to the Vice-President's chair, while that debonair man of the
      world took a seat on his right with easy grace. On Mr. Jefferson's left
      sat Chief Justice John Marshall, a "tall, lax, lounging Virginian," with
      black eyes peering out from his swarthy countenance. There is a dramatic
      quality in this scene of the President-to-be seated between two men who
      are to cause him more vexation of spirit than any others in public life.
      Burr, brilliant, gifted, ambitious, and profligate; Marshall,
      temperamentally and by conviction opposed to the principles which seemed
      to have triumphed in the election of this radical Virginian, to whom
      indeed he had a deep-seated aversion. After a short pause, Mr. Jefferson
      rose and read his Inaugural Address in a tone so low that it could be
      heard by only a few in the crowded chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who expected to hear revolutionary doctrines must have been
      surprised by the studied moderation of this address. There was not a
      Federalist within hearing of Jefferson's voice who could not have
      subscribed to all the articles in this profession of political faith.
      "Equal and exact justice to all men"&mdash;"a jealous care of the right of
      election by the people"&mdash;"absolute acquiescence in the decisions of
      the majority"&mdash;"the supremacy of the civil over the military
      authority"&mdash;"the honest payments of our debts"&mdash;"freedom of
      religion"&mdash;"freedom of the press"&mdash;"freedom of person under the
      protection of the habeas corpus"&mdash;what were these principles but the
      bright constellation, as Jefferson said, "which has guided our steps
      through an age of revolution and reformation?" John Adams himself might
      have enunciated all these principles, though he would have distributed the
      emphasis somewhat differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did Jefferson mean when he said, "We have called by different
      names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans&mdash;we are
      all Federalists." If this was true, what, pray, became of the revolution
      of 1800, which Jefferson had declared "as real a revolution in the
      principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form?" Even
      Jefferson's own followers shook their heads dubiously over this passage as
      they read and reread it in the news-sheets. It sounded a false note while
      the echoes of the campaign of 1800 were still reverberating. If Hamilton
      and his followers were monarchists at heart in 1800, bent upon
      overthrowing the Government, how could they and the triumphant Republicans
      be brethren of the same principle in 1801? The truth of the matter is that
      Jefferson was holding out an olive branch to his political opponents. He
      believed, as he remarked in a private letter, that many Federalists were
      sound Republicans at heart who had been stampeded into the ranks of his
      opponents during the recent troubles with France. These lost political
      sheep Jefferson was bent upon restoring to the Republican fold by avoiding
      utterances and acts which would offend them. "I always exclude the leaders
      from these considerations," he added confidentially. In short, this
      Inaugural Address was less a great state paper, marking a broad path for
      the Government to follow under stalwart leadership, than an astute effort
      to consolidate the victory of the Republican party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disappointing the address must have been to those who had expected a
      declaration of specific policy. Yet the historian, wiser by the march of
      events, may read between the lines. When Jefferson said that he desired a
      wise and frugal government&mdash;a government "which should restrain men
      from injuring one another but otherwise leave them free to regulate their
      own pursuits&mdash;" and when he announced his purpose "to support the
      state governments in all their rights" and to cultivate "peace with all
      nations&mdash;entangling alliances with none," he was in effect
      formulating a policy. But all this was in the womb of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was many weeks before Jefferson took up his abode in the President's
      House. In the interval he remained in his old quarters, except for a visit
      to Monticello to arrange for his removal, which indeed he was in no haste
      to make, for "The Palace," as the President's House was dubbed
      satirically, was not yet finished; its walls were not fully plastered, and
      it still lacked the main staircase-which, it must be admitted, was a
      serious defect if the new President meant to hold court. Besides, it was
      inconveniently situated at the other end of the, straggling, unkempt
      village. At Conrad's Jefferson could still keep in touch with those
      members of Congress and those friends upon whose advice he relied in
      putting "our Argosie on her Republican tack," as he was wont to say. Here,
      in his drawing-room, he could talk freely with practical politicians such
      as Charles Pinckney, who had carried the ticket to success in South
      Carolina and who might reasonably expect to be consulted in organizing the
      new Administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief posts in the President's official household, save one, were
      readily filled. There were only five heads of departments to be appointed,
      and of these the Attorney-General might be described as a head without a
      department, since the duties of his office were few and required only his
      occasional attention. As it fell out, however, the Attorney-General whom
      Jefferson appointed, Levi Lincoln of Massachusetts, practically carried on
      the work of all the Executive Departments until his colleagues were duly
      appointed and commissioned. For Secretary of War Jefferson chose another
      reliable New Englander, Henry Dearborn of Maine. The naval portfolio went
      begging, perhaps because the navy was not an imposing branch of the
      service, or because the new President had announced his desire to lay up
      all seven frigates in the eastern branch of the Potomac, where "they would
      be under the immediate eye of the department and would require but one set
      of plunderers to look after them." One conspicuous Republican after
      another declined this dubious honor, and in the end Jefferson was obliged
      to appoint as Secretary of the Navy Robert Smith, whose chief
      qualification was his kinship to General Samuel Smith, an influential
      politician of Maryland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appointment by Jefferson of James Madison as Secretary of State
      occasioned no surprise, for the intimate friendship of the two Virginians
      and their long and close association in politics led everyone to expect
      that he would occupy an important post in the new Administration, though
      in truth that friendship was based on something deeper and finer than mere
      agreement in politics. "I do believe," exclaimed a lady who often saw both
      men in private life, "father never loved son more than Mr. Jefferson loves
      Mr. Madison." The difference in age, however, was not great, for Jefferson
      was in his fifty-eighth year and Madison in his fiftieth. It was rather
      mien and character that suggested the filial relationship. Jefferson was,
      or could be if he chose, an imposing figure; his stature was six feet two
      and one-half inches. Madison had the ways and habits of a little man, for
      he was only five feet six. Madison was naturally timid and retiring in the
      presence of other men, but he was at his best in the company of his friend
      Jefferson, who valued his attainments. Indeed, the two men supplemented
      each other. If Jefferson was prone to theorize, Madison was disposed to
      find historical evidence to support a political doctrine. While Jefferson
      generalized boldly, even rashly, Madison hesitated, temporized, weighed
      the pros and cons, and came with difficulty to a conclusion. Unhappily
      neither was a good judge of men. When pitted against a Bonaparte, a
      Talleyrand, or a Canning, they appeared provincial in their ways and
      limited in their sympathetic understanding of statesmen of the Old World.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to that of Madison, Jefferson valued the friendship of Albert
      Gallatin, whom he made Secretary of the Treasury by a recess appointment,
      since there was some reason to fear that the Federalist Senate would not
      confirm the nomination. The Federalists could never forget that Gallatin
      was a Swiss by birth&mdash;an alien of supposedly radical tendencies. The
      partisan press never exhibited its crass provincialism more shamefully
      than when it made fun of Gallatin's imperfect pronunciation of English. He
      had come to America, indeed, too late to acquire a perfect control of a
      new tongue, but not too late to become a loyal son of his adopted country.
      He brought to Jefferson's group of advisers not only a thorough knowledge
      of public finance but a sound judgment and a statesmanlike vision, which
      were often needed to rectify the political vagaries of his chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last of his Cabinet appointments made, Jefferson returned to his
      country seat at Monticello for August and September, for he was determined
      not to pass those two "bilious months" in Washington. "I have not done it
      these forty years," he wrote to Gallatin. "Grumble who will, I will never
      pass those two months on tidewater." To Monticello, indeed, Jefferson
      turned whenever his duties permitted and not merely in the sickly months
      of summer, for when the roads were good the journey was rapidly and easily
      made by stage or chaise. There, in his garden and farm, he found relief
      from the distractions of public life. "No occupation is so delightful to
      me," he confessed, "as the culture of the earth, and no culture comparable
      to that of the garden." At Monticello, too, he could gratify his delight
      in the natural sciences, for he was a true child of the eighteenth century
      in his insatiable curiosity about the physical universe and in his desire
      to reduce that universe to an intelligible mechanism. He was by instinct a
      rationalist and a foe to superstition in any form, whether in science or
      religion. His indefatigable pen was as ready to discuss vaccination and
      yellow fever with Dr. Benjamin Rush as it was to exchange views with Dr.
      Priestley on the ethics of Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diversity of Jefferson's interests is truly remarkable. Monticello is
      a monument to his almost Yankee-like ingenuity. He writes to his friend
      Thomas Paine to assure him that the semi-cylindrical form of roof after
      the De Lorme pattern, which he proposes for his house, is entirely
      practicable, for he himself had "used it at home for a dome, being 120
      degrees of an oblong octagon." He was characteristically American in his
      receptivity to new ideas from any source. A chance item about Eli Whitney
      of New Haven arrests his attention and forthwith he writes to Madison
      recommending a "Mr. Whitney at Connecticut, a mechanic of the first order
      of ingenuity, who invented the cotton gin," and who has recently invented
      "molds and machines for making all the pieces of his [musket] locks so
      exactly equal that take one hundred locks to pieces and mingle their parts
      and the hundred locks may be put together as well by taking the first
      pieces which come to hand." To Robert Fulton, then laboring to perfect his
      torpedoes and submarine, Jefferson wrote encouragingly: "I have ever
      looked to the submarine boat as most to be depended on for attaching them
      [i. e., torpedoes].... I am in hopes it is not to be abandoned as
      impracticable."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not wholly affectation, therefore, when Jefferson wrote, "Nature
      intended me for the tranquil pursuits of science, by rendering them my
      supreme delight. But the enormities of the times in which I have lived,
      have forced me to take a part in resisting them, and to commit myself on
      the boisterous ocean of political passions." One can readily picture this
      Virginia farmer-philosopher ruefully closing his study door, taking a last
      look over the gardens and fields of Monticello, in the golden days of
      October, and mounting Wildair, his handsome thoroughbred, setting out on
      the dusty road for that little political world at Washington, where rumor
      so often got the better of reason and where gossip was so likely to
      destroy philosophic serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jefferson had been a widower for many years; and so, since his daughters
      were married and had households of their own, he was forced to preside
      over his menage at Washington without the feminine touch and tact so much
      needed at this American court. Perhaps it was this unhappy circumstance
      quite as much as his dislike for ceremonies and formalities that made
      Jefferson do away with the weekly levees of his predecessors and appoint
      only two days, the First of January and the Fourth of July, for public
      receptions. On such occasions he begged Mrs. Dolly Madison to act as
      hostess; and a charming and gracious figure she was, casting a certain
      extenuating veil over the President's gaucheries. Jefferson held, with his
      many political heresies, certain theories of social intercourse which ran
      rudely counter to the prevailing etiquette of foreign courts. Among the
      rules which he devised for his republican court, the precedence due to
      rank was conspicuously absent, because he held that "all persons when
      brought together in society are perfectly equal, whether foreign or
      domestic, titled or untitled, in or out of office." One of these rules to
      which the Cabinet gravely subscribed read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To maintain the principles of equality, or of pele mele, and prevent the
      growth of precedence out of courtesy, the members of the Executive will
      practise at their own houses, and recommend an adherence to the ancient
      usage of the country, of gentlemen in mass giving precedence to the ladies
      in mass, in passing from one apartment where they are assembled into
      another."
    </p>
    <p>
      The application of this rule on one occasion gave rise to an incident
      which convulsed Washington society. President Jefferson had invited to
      dinner the new British Minister Merry and his wife, the Spanish Minister
      Yrujo and his wife, the French Minister Pichon and his wife, and Mr. and
      Mrs. Madison. When dinner was announced, Mr. Jefferson gave his hand to
      Mrs. Madison and seated her on his right, leaving the rest to straggle in
      as they pleased. Merry, fresh from the Court of St. James, was aghast and
      affronted; and when a few days later, at a dinner given by the Secretary
      of State, he saw Mrs. Merry left without an escort, while Mr. Madison took
      Mrs. Gallatin to the table, he believed that a deliberate insult was
      intended. To appease this indignant Briton the President was obliged to
      explain officially his rule of "pole mele"; but Mrs. Merry was not
      appeased and positively refused to appear at the President's New Year's
      Day reception. "Since then," wrote the amused Pichon, "Washington society
      is turned upside down; all the women are to the last degree exasperated
      against Mrs. Merry; the Federalist newspapers have taken up the matter,
      and increased the irritations by sarcasms on the administration and by
      making a burlesque of the facts." Then Merry refused an invitation to dine
      again at the President's, saying that he awaited instructions from his
      Government; and the Marquis Yrujo, who had reasons of his own for
      fomenting trouble, struck an alliance with the Merrys and also declined
      the President's invitation. Jefferson was incensed at their conduct, but
      put the blame upon Mrs. Merry, whom he characterized privately as a
      "virago who has already disturbed our harmony extremely."
    </p>
    <p>
      A brilliant English essayist has observed that a government to secure
      obedience must first excite reverence. Some such perception, coinciding
      with native taste, had moved George Washington to assume the trappings of
      royalty, in order to surround the new presidential office with impressive
      dignity. Posterity has, accordingly, visualized the first President and
      Father of his Country as a statuesque figure, posing at formal levees with
      a long sword in a scabbard of white polished leather, and clothed in black
      velvet knee-breeches, with yellow gloves and a cocked hat. The third
      President of the United States harbored no such illusions and affected no
      such poses. Governments were made by rational beings&mdash;"by the consent
      of the governed," he had written in a memorable document&mdash;and rested
      on no emotional basis. Thomas Jefferson remained Thomas Jefferson after
      his election to the chief magistracy; and so contemporaries saw him in the
      President's House, an unimpressive figure clad in "a blue coat, a thick
      gray-colored hairy waistcoat, with a red underwaist lapped over it, green
      velveteen breeches, with pearl buttons, yarn stockings, and slippers down
      at the heels." Anyone might have found him, as Senator Maclay did, sitting
      "in a lounging manner, on one hip commonly, and with one of his shoulders
      elevated much above the other," a loose, shackling figure with no pretense
      at dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his dislike for all artificial distinctions between man and man,
      Jefferson determined from the outset to dispense a true Southern
      hospitality at the President's House and to welcome any one at any hour on
      any day. There was therefore some point to John Quincy Adams's witticism
      that Jefferson's "whole eight years was a levee." No one could deny that
      he entertained handsomely. Even his political opponents rose from his
      table with a comfortable feeling of satiety which made them more kindly in
      their attitude toward their host. "We sat down at the table at four,"
      wrote Senator Plumer of New Hampshire, "rose at six, and walked
      immediately into another room and drank coffee. We had a very good dinner,
      with a profusion of fruits and sweetmeats. The wine was the best I ever
      drank, particularly the champagne, which was indeed delicious."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the circle of his intimates that Jefferson appeared at his best,
      and of all his intimate friends Madison knew best how to evoke the true
      Jefferson. To outsiders Madison appeared rather taciturn, but among his
      friends he was genial and even lively, amusing all by his ready humor and
      flashes of wit. To his changes of mood Jefferson always responded. Once
      started Jefferson would talk on and on, in a loose and rambling fashion,
      with a great deal of exaggeration and with many vagaries, yet always
      scattering much information on a great variety of topics. Here we may
      leave him for the moment, in the exhilarating hours following his
      inauguration, discoursing with Pinckney, Gallatin, Madison, Burr,
      Randolph, Giles, Macon, and many another good Republican, and evolving the
      policies of his Administration.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. PUTTING THE SHIP ON HER REPUBLICAN TACK
    </h2>
    <p>
      President Jefferson took office in a spirit of exultation which he made no
      effort to disguise in his private letters. "The tough sides of our
      Argosie," he wrote to John Dickinson, "have been thoroughly tried. Her
      strength has stood the waves into which she was steered with a view to
      sink her. We shall put her on her Republican tack, and she will now show
      by the beauty of her motion the skill of her builders." In him as in his
      two intimates, Gallatin and Madison, there was a touch of that philosophy
      which colored the thought of reformers on the eve of the French
      Revolution, a naive confidence in the perfectability of man and the
      essential worthiness of his aspirations. Strike from man the shackles of
      despotism and superstition and accord to him a free government, and he
      would rise to unsuspected felicity. Republican government was the
      strongest government on earth, because it was founded on free will and
      imposed the fewest checks on the legitimate desires of men. Only one thing
      was wanting to make the American people happy and prosperous, said the
      President in his Inaugural Address "a wise and frugal government, which
      shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them
      otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement,
      and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned." This,
      he believed, was the sum of good government; and this was the government
      which he was determined to establish. Whether government thus reduced to
      lowest terms would prove adequate in a world rent by war, only the future
      could disclose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only in intimate letters and in converse with Gallatin and Madison
      that Jefferson revealed his real purposes. So completely did Jefferson
      take these two advisers into his confidence, and so loyal was their
      cooperation, that the Government for eight years has been described as a
      triumvirate almost as clearly defined as any triumvirate of Rome. Three
      more congenial souls certainly have never ruled a nation, for they were
      drawn together not merely by agreement on a common policy but by
      sympathetic understanding of the fundamental principles of government.
      Gallatin and Madison often frequented the President's House, and there one
      may see them in imagination and perhaps catch now and then a fragment of
      their conversation:
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallatin: We owe much to geographical position; we have been fortunate in
      escaping foreign wars. If we can maintain peaceful relations with other
      nations, we can keep down the cost of administration and avoid all the
      ills which follow too much government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President: After all, we are chiefly an agricultural people and if we
      shape our policy accordingly we shall be much more likely to multiply and
      be happy than as if we mimicked an Amsterdam, a Hamburg, or a city like
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madison (quietly): I quite agree with you. We must keep the government
      simple and republican, avoiding the corruption which inevitably prevails
      in crowded cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallatin (pursuing his thought): The moment you allow the national debt to
      mount, you entail burdens on posterity and augment the operations of
      government.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President (bitterly): The principle of spending money to be paid by
      posterity is but swindling futurity on a large scale. That was what
      Hamilton&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallatin: Just so; and if this administration does not reduce taxes, they
      will never be reduced. We must strike at the root of the evil and avert
      the danger of multiplying the functions of government. I would repeal all
      internal taxes. These pretended tax-preparations, treasure-preparations,
      and army-preparations against contingent wars tend only to encourage wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President (nodding his head in agreement): The discharge of the debt
      is vital to the destinies of our government, and for the present we must
      make all objects subordinate to this. We must confine our general
      government to foreign concerns only and let our affairs be disentangled
      from those of all other nations, except as to commerce. And our commerce
      is so valuable to other nations that they will be glad to purchase it,
      when they know that all we ask is justice. Why, then, should we not reduce
      our general government to a very simple organization and a very
      unexpensive one&mdash;a few plain duties to be performed by a few
      servants?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was precisely the matter of selecting these few servants which worried
      the President during his first months in office, for the federal offices
      were held by Federalists almost to a man. He hoped that he would have to
      make only a few removals any other course would expose him to the charge
      of inconsistency after his complacent statement that there was no
      fundamental difference between Republicans and Federalists. But his
      followers thought otherwise; they wanted the spoils of victory and they
      meant to have them. Slowly and reluctantly Jefferson yielded to pressure,
      justifying himself as he did so by the reflection that a due participation
      in office was a matter of right. And how, pray, could due participation be
      obtained, if there were no removals? Deaths were regrettably few; and
      resignations could hardly be expected. Once removals were decided upon,
      Jefferson drifted helplessly upon the tide. For a moment, it is true, he
      wrote hopefully about establishing an equilibrium and then returning "with
      joy to that state of things when the only questions concerning a candidate
      shall be: Is he honest? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the
      Constitution?" That blessed expectation was never realized. By the end of
      his second term, a Federalist in office was as rare as a Republican under
      Adams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The removal of the Collector of the Port at New Haven and the appointment
      of an octogenarian whose chief qualification was his Republicanism brought
      to a head all the bitter animosity of Federalist New England. The
      hostility to Jefferson in this region was no ordinary political
      opposition, as he knew full well, for it was compounded of many
      ingredients. In New England there was a greater social solidarity than
      existed anywhere else in the Union. Descended from English stock, imbued
      with common religious and political traditions, and bound together by the
      ties of a common ecclesiastical polity, the people of this section had, as
      Jefferson expressed it, "a sort of family pride." Here all the forces of
      education, property, religion, and respectability were united in the
      maintenance of the established order against the assaults of democracy.
      New England Federalism was not so much a body of political doctrine as a
      state of mind. Abhorrence of the forces liberated by the French Revolution
      was the dominating emotion. To the Federalist leaders democracy seemed an
      aberration of the human mind, which was bound everywhere to produce
      infidelity, looseness of morals, and political chaos. In the words of
      their Jeremiah, Fisher Ames, "Democracy is a troubled spirit, fated never
      to rest, and whose dreams, if it sleeps, present only visions of hell." So
      thinking and feeling, they had witnessed the triumph of Jefferson with
      genuine alarm, for Jefferson they held to be no better than a Jacobin,
      bent upon subverting the social order and saturated with all the heterodox
      notions of Voltaire and Thomas Paine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appointment of the aged Samuel Bishop as Collector of New Haven was
      evidence enough to the Federalist mind, which fed upon suspicion, that
      Jefferson intended to reward his son, Abraham Bishop, for political
      services. The younger Bishop was a stench in their nostrils, for at a
      recent celebration of the Republican victory he had shocked the good
      people of Connecticut by characterizing Jefferson as "the illustrious
      chief who, once insulted, now presides over the Union," and comparing him
      with the Saviour of the world, "who, once insulted, now presides over the
      universe." And this had not been his first transgression: he was known as
      an active and intemperate rebel against the standing order. No wonder that
      Theodore Dwight voiced the alarm of all New England Federalists in an
      oration at New Haven, in which he declared that according to the doctrines
      of Jacobinism "the greatest villain in the community is the fittest person
      to make and execute the laws." "We have now," said he, "reached the
      consummation of democratic blessedness. We have a country governed by
      blockheads and knaves." Here was an opposition which, if persisted in,
      might menace the integrity of the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely less vexatious was the business of appointments in New York where
      three factions in the Republican party struggled for the control of the
      patronage. Which should the President support? Gallatin, whose
      father-in-law was prominent in the politics of the State, was inclined to
      favor Burr and his followers; but the President already felt a deep
      distrust of Burr and finally surrendered to the importunities of DeWitt
      Clinton, who had formed an alliance with the Livingston interests to drive
      Burr from the party. Despite the pettiness of the game, which disgusted
      both Gallatin and Jefferson, the decision was fateful. It was no light
      matter, even for the chief magistrate, to offend Aaron Burr.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these worrisome details of administration, the President turned with
      relief to the preparation of his first address to Congress. The keynote
      was to be economy. But just how economies were actually to be effected was
      not so clear. For months Gallatin had been toiling over masses of
      statistics, trying to reconcile a policy of reduced taxation, to satisfy
      the demands of the party, with the discharge of the public debt. By
      laborious calculation he found that if $7,300,000 were set aside each
      year, the debt&mdash;principal and interest&mdash;could be discharged
      within sixteen years. But if the unpopular excise were abandoned, where
      was the needed revenue to be found? New taxes were not to be thought of.
      The alternative, then, was to reduce expenditures. But how and where?
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances the President and his Cabinet adopted the course
      which in the light of subsequent events seems to have been woefully
      ill-timed and hazardous in the extreme. They determined to sacrifice the
      army and navy. In extenuation of this decision, it may be said that the
      danger of war with France, which had forced the Adams Administration to
      double expenditures, had passed; and that Europe was at this moment at
      peace, though only the most sanguine and shortsighted could believe that
      continued peace was possible in Europe with the First Consul in the
      saddle. It was agreed, then, that the expenditures for the military and
      naval establishments should be kept at about $2,500,000&mdash;somewhat
      below the normal appropriation before the recent war-flurry; and that
      wherever possible expenses should be reduced by careful pruning of the
      list of employees at the navy yards. Such was the programme of humdrum
      economy which President Jefferson laid before Congress. After the exciting
      campaign of 1800, when the public was assured that the forces of Darkness
      and Light were locked in deadly combat for the soul of the nation, this
      tame programme seemed like an anticlimax. But those who knew Thomas
      Jefferson learned to discount the vagaries to which he gave expression in
      conversation. As John Quincy Adams once remarked after listening to
      Jefferson's brilliant table talk, "Mr. Jefferson loves to excite wonder."
      Yet Thomas Jefferson, philosopher, was a very different person from Thomas
      Jefferson, practical politician. Paradoxical as it may seem, the new
      President, of all men of his day, was the least likely to undertake
      revolutionary policies; and it was just this acquaintance with Jefferson's
      mental habits which led his inveterate enemy, Alexander Hamilton, to
      advise his party associates to elect Jefferson rather than Burr.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President broke with precedent, however, in one small particular. He
      was resolved not to follow the practice of his Federalist predecessors and
      address Congress in person. The President's speech to the two houses in
      joint session savored too much of a speech from the throne; it was a
      symptom of the Federalist leaning to monarchical forms and practices. He
      sent his address, therefore, in writing, accompanied with letters to the
      presiding officers of the two chambers, in which he justified this
      departure from custom on the ground of convenience and economy of time. "I
      have had principal regard," he wrote, "to the convenience of the
      Legislature, to the economy of their time, to the relief from the
      embarrassment of immediate answers on subjects not yet fully before them,
      and to the benefits thence resulting to the public affairs." This
      explanation deceived no one, unless it was the writer himself. It was
      thoroughly characteristic of Thomas Jefferson that he often explained his
      conduct by reasons which were obvious afterthoughts&mdash;an unfortunate
      habit which has led his contemporaries and his unfriendly biographers to
      charge him with hypocrisy. And it must be admitted that his preference for
      indirect methods of achieving a purpose exposed him justly to the
      reproaches of those who liked frankness and plain dealing. It is not
      unfair, then, to wonder whether the President was not thinking rather of
      his own convenience when he elected to address Congress by written
      message, for he was not a ready nor an impressive speaker. At all events,
      he established a precedent which remained unbroken until another
      Democratic President, one hundred and twelve years later, returned to the
      practice of Washington and Adams.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Federalists of New England are to be believed, hypocrisy marked the
      presidential message from the very beginning to the end. It began with a
      pious expression of thanks "to the beneficent Being" who had been pleased
      to breathe into the warring peoples of Europe a spirit of forgiveness and
      conciliation. But even the most bigoted Federalist who could not tolerate
      religious views differing from his own must have been impressed with the
      devout and sincere desire of the President to preserve peace. Peace!
      peace! It was a sentiment which ran through the message like the watermark
      in the very paper on which he wrote; it was the condition, the absolutely
      indispensable condition, of every chaste reformation which he advocated.
      Every reduction of public expenditure was predicated on the supposition
      that the danger of war was remote because other nations would desire to
      treat the United States justly. "Salutary reductions in habitual
      expenditures" were urged in every branch of the public service from the
      diplomatic and revenue services to the judiciary and the naval yards. War
      might come, indeed, but "sound principles would not justify our taxing the
      industry of our fellow-citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to happen
      we know not when, and which might not, perhaps, happen but from the
      temptations offered by that treasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      On all concrete matters the President's message cut close to the line
      which Gallatin had marked out. The internal taxes should now be dispensed
      with and corresponding reductions be made in "our habitual expenditures."
      There had been unwise multiplication of federal offices, many of which
      added nothing to the efficiency of the Government but only to the cost.
      These useless offices should be lopped off, for "when we consider that
      this Government is charged with the external and mutual relations only of
      these States,... we may well doubt whether our organization is not too
      complicated, too expensive." In this connection Congress might well
      consider the Federal Judiciary, particularly the courts newly erected, and
      "judge of the proportion which the institution bears to the business it
      has to perform." * And finally, Congress should consider whether the law
      relating to naturalization should not be revised. "A denial of citizenship
      under a residence of fourteen years is a denial to a great proportion of
      those who ask it"; and "shall we refuse to the unhappy fugitives from
      distress that hospitality which savages of the wilderness extended to our
      fathers arriving in this land?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The studied moderation of the message gave no hint of
     Jefferson's resolute purpose to procure the repeal of the
     Judiciary Act of 1801. The history of this act and its
     repeal, as well as of the attack upon the judiciary, is
     recounted by Edward S. Corwin in "John Marshall and the
     Constitution" in "The Chronicles of America."
</pre>
    <p>
      The most inveterate foe could not characterize this message as
      revolutionary, however much he might dissent from the policies advocated.
      It was not Jefferson's way, indeed, to announce his intentions boldly and
      hew his way relentlessly to his objective. He was far too astute as a
      party leader to attempt to force his will upon Republicans in Congress. He
      would suggest; he would advise; he would cautiously express an opinion;
      but he would never dictate. Yet few Presidents have exercised a stronger
      directive influence upon Congress than Thomas Jefferson during the greater
      part of his Administration. So long as he was en rapport with Nathaniel
      Macon, Speaker of the House, and with John Randolph, Chairman of the
      Committee on Ways and Means, he could direct the policies of his party as
      effectively as the most autocratic dictator. When he had made up his mind
      that Justice Samuel Chase of the Supreme Court should be impeached, he
      simply penned a note to Joseph Nicholson, who was then managing the
      impeachment of Judge Pickering, raising the question whether Chase's
      attack on the principles of the Constitution should go unpunished. "I ask
      these questions for your consideration," said the President deferentially;
      "for myself, it is better that I should not interfere." And eventually
      impeachment proceedings were instituted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this memorable first message, the President alluded to a little
      incident which had occurred in the Mediterranean, "the only exception to
      this state of general peace with which we have been blessed." Tripoli, one
      of the Barbary States, had begun depredations upon American commerce and
      the President had sent a small squadron for protection. A ship of this
      squadron, the schooner Enterprise, had fallen in with a Tripolitan
      man-of-war and after a fight lasting three hours had forced the corsair to
      strike her colors. But since war had not been declared and the President's
      orders were to act only on the defensive, the crew of the Enterprise
      dismantled the captured vessel and let her go. Would Congress, asked the
      President, take under consideration the advisability of placing our forces
      on an equality with those of our adversaries? Neither the President nor
      his Secretary of the Treasury seems to have been aware that this single
      cloud on the horizon portended a storm of long duration. Yet within a year
      it became necessary to delay further reductions in the naval establishment
      and to impose new taxes to meet the very contingency which the
      peace-loving President declared most remote. Moreover, the very frigates
      which he had proposed to lay up in the eastern branch of the Potomac were
      manned and dispatched to the Mediterranean to bring the Corsairs to terms.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. THE CORSAIRS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shortly after Jefferson's inauguration a visitor presented himself at the
      Executive Mansion with disquieting news from the Mediterranean. Captain
      William Bainbridge of the frigate George Washington had just returned from
      a disagreeable mission. He had been commissioned to carry to the Dey of
      Algiers the annual tribute which the United States had contracted to pay.
      It appeared that while the frigate lay at anchor under the shore batteries
      off Algiers, the Dey attempted to requisition her to carry his ambassador
      and some Turkish passengers to Constantinople. Bainbridge, who felt justly
      humiliated by his mission, wrathfully refused. An American frigate do
      errands for this insignificant pirate? He thought not! The Dey pointed to
      his batteries, however, and remarked, "You pay me tribute, by which you
      become my slaves; I have, therefore, a right to order you as I may think
      proper." The logic of the situation was undeniably on the side of the
      master of the shore batteries. Rather than have his ship blown to bits,
      Bainbridge swallowed his wrath and submitted. On the eve of departure, he
      had to submit to another indignity. The colors of Algiers must fly at the
      masthead. Again Bainbridge remonstrated and again the Dey looked casually
      at his guns trained on the frigate. So off the frigate sailed with the
      Dey's flag fluttering from her masthead, and her captain cursing lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage of fifty-nine days to Constantinople, as Bainbridge recounted
      it to the President, was not without its amusing incidents. Bainbridge
      regaled the President with accounts of his Mohammedan passengers, who
      found much difficulty in keeping their faces to the east while the frigate
      went about on a new tack. One of the faithful was delegated finally to
      watch the compass so that the rest might continue their prayers
      undisturbed. And at Constantinople Bainbridge had curious experiences with
      the Moslems. He announced his arrival as from the United States of America
      he had hauled down the Dey's flag as soon as he was out of reach of the
      batteries. The port officials were greatly puzzled. What, pray, were the
      United States? Bainbridge explained that they were part of the New World
      which Columbus had discovered. The Grand Seigneur then showed great
      interest in the stars of the American flag, remarking that, as his own was
      decorated with one of the heavenly bodies, the coincidence must be a good
      omen of the future friendly intercourse of the two nations. Bainbridge did
      his best to turn his unpalatable mission to good account, but he returned
      home in bitter humiliation. He begged that he might never again be sent to
      Algiers with tribute unless he was authorized to deliver it from the
      cannon's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President listened sympathetically to Bainbridge's story, for he was
      not unfamiliar with the ways of the Barbary Corsairs and he had long been
      of the opinion that tribute only made these pirates bolder and more
      insufferable. The Congress of the Confederation, however, had followed the
      policy of the European powers and had paid tribute to secure immunity from
      attack, and the new Government had simply continued the policy of the old.
      In spite of his abhorrence of war, Jefferson held that coercion in this
      instance was on the whole cheaper and more efficacious. Not long after
      this interview with Bainbridge, President Jefferson was warned that the
      Pasha of Tripoli was worrying the American Consul with importunate demands
      for more tribute. This African potentate had discovered that his brother,
      the Dey of Algiers, had made a better bargain with the United States. He
      announced, therefore, that he must have a new treaty with more tribute or
      he would declare war. Fearing trouble from this quarter, the President
      dispatched a squadron of four vessels under Commodore Richard Dale to
      cruise in the Mediterranean, with orders to protect American commerce. It
      was the schooner Enterprise of this squadron which overpowered the
      Tripolitan cruiser, as Jefferson recounted in his message to Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The former Pasha of Tripoli had been blessed with three sons, Hasan,
      Hamet, and Yusuf. Between these royal brothers, however, there seems to
      have been some incompatibility of temperament, for when their father died
      (Blessed be Allah!) Yusuf, the youngest, had killed Hasan and had spared
      Hamet only because he could not lay hands upon him. Yusuf then proclaimed
      himself Pasha. It was Yusuf, the Pasha with this bloody record, who
      declared war on the United States, May 10,1801, by cutting down the
      flagstaff of the American consulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      To apply the term war to the naval operations which followed is, however,
      to lend specious importance to very trivial events. Commodore Dale made
      the most of his little squadron, it is true, convoying merchantmen through
      the straits and along the Barbary coast, holding Tripolitan vessels laden
      with grain in hopeless inactivity off Gibraltar, and blockading the port
      of Tripoli, now with one frigate and now with another. When the terms of
      enlistment of Dale's crews expired, another squadron was gradually
      assembled in the Mediterranean, under the command of Captain Richard V.
      Morris, for Congress had now authorized the use of the navy for offensive
      operations, and the Secretary of the Treasury, with many misgivings, had
      begun to accumulate his Mediterranean Fund to meet contingent expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blockade of Tripoli seems to have been carelessly conducted by Morris
      and was finally abandoned. There were undeniably great difficulties in the
      way of an effective blockade. The coast afforded few good harbors; the
      heavy northerly winds made navigation both difficult and hazardous; the
      Tripolitan galleys and gunboats with their shallow draft could stand close
      in shore and elude the American frigates; and the ordnance on the American
      craft was not heavy enough to inflict any serious damage on the
      fortifications guarding the harbor. Probably these difficulties were not
      appreciated by the authorities at Washington; at all events, in the spring
      of 1803 Morris was suspended from his command and subsequently lost his
      commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the squadron of which Commodore Preble now took command was the
      Philadelphia, a frigate of thirty-six guns, to which Captain Bainbridge,
      eager to square accounts with the Corsairs, had been assigned. Late in
      October Bainbridge sighted a Tripolitan vessel standing in shore. He gave
      chase at once with perhaps more zeal than discretion, following his quarry
      well in shore in the hope of disabling her before she could make the
      harbor. Failing to intercept the corsair, he went about and was heading
      out to sea when the frigate ran on an uncharted reef and stuck fast. A
      worse predicament could scarcely be imagined. Every device known to Yankee
      seamen was employed to free the unlucky vessel. "The sails were promptly
      laid a-back," Bainbridge reported, "and the forward guns run aft, in hopes
      of backing her off, which not producing the desired effect, orders were
      given to stave the water in her hold and pump it out, throw overboard the
      lumber and heavy articles of every kind, cut away the anchors... and throw
      over all the guns, except a few for our defence.... As a last resource the
      foremast and main-topgallant mast were cut away, but without any
      beneficial effect, and the ship remained a perfect wreck, exposed to the
      constant fire of the gunboats, which could not be returned."
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers advised Bainbridge that the situation was becoming
      intolerable and justified desperate measures. They had been raked by a
      galling fire for more than four hours; they had tried every means of
      floating the ship; humiliating as the alternative was, they saw no other
      course than to strike the colors. All agreed, therefore, that they should
      flood the magazine, scuttle the ship, and surrender to the Tripolitan
      small craft which hovered around the doomed frigate like so many vultures.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time off this accursed coast Bainbridge hauled down his
      colors. The crews of the Tripolitan gunboats swarmed aboard and set about
      plundering right and left. Swords, epaulets, watches, money, and clothing
      were stripped from the officers; and if the crew in the forecastle
      suffered less it was because they had less to lose. Officers and men were
      then tumbled into boats and taken ashore, half-naked and humiliated beyond
      words. Escorted by the exultant rabble, these three hundred luckless
      Americans were marched to the castle, where the Pasha sat in state. His
      Highness was in excellent humor. Three hundred Americans! He counted them,
      each worth hundreds of dollars. Allah was good!
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, weary bondage awaited the captives. The common seamen were treated
      like galley slaves, but the officers were given some consideration through
      the intercession of the Danish consul. Bainbridge was even allowed to
      correspond with Commodore Preble, and by means of invisible ink he
      transmitted many important messages which escaped the watchful eyes of his
      captors. Depressed by his misfortune&mdash;for no one then or afterwards
      held him responsible for the disaster&mdash;Bainbridge had only one
      thought, and that was revenge. Day and night he brooded over plans of
      escape and retribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though to make the captive Americans drink the dregs of humiliation,
      the Philadelphia was floated off the reef in a heavy sea and towed safely
      into the harbor. The scuttling of the vessel had been hastily contrived,
      and the jubilant Tripolitans succeeded in stopping her seams before she
      could fill. A frigate like the Philadelphia was a prize the like of which
      had never been seen in the Pasha's reign. He rubbed his hands in glee and
      taunted her crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the frigate riding peacefully at anchor in the harbor was
      torture to poor Bainbridge. In feverish letters he implored Preble to
      bombard the town, to sink the gunboats in the harbor, to recapture the
      frigate or to burn her at her moorings&mdash;anything to take away the
      bitterness of humiliation. The latter alternative, indeed, Preble had been
      revolving in his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward midnight of February 16, 1804, Bainbridge and his companions were
      aroused by the guns of the fort. They sprang to the window and witnessed
      the spectacle for which the unhappy captain had prayed long and devoutly.
      The Philadelphia was in flames&mdash;red, devouring flames, pouring out of
      her hold, climbing the rigging, licking her topmasts, forming fantastic
      columns&mdash;devastating, unconquerable flames&mdash;the frigate was
      doomed, doomed! And every now and then one of her guns would explode as
      though booming out her requiem. Bainbridge was avenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      How had it all happened? The inception of this daring feat must be
      credited to Commodore Preble; the execution fell to young Stephen Decatur,
      lieutenant in command of the sloop Enterprise. The plan was this: to use
      the Intrepid, a captured Tripolitan ketch, as the instrument of
      destruction, equipping her with combustibles and ammunition, and if
      possible to burn the Philadelphia and other ships in the harbor while
      raking the Pasha's castle with the frigate's eighteen-pounders. When
      Decatur mustered his crew on the deck of the Enterprise and called for
      volunteers for this exploit, every man jack stepped forward. Not a man but
      was spoiling for excitement after months of tedious inactivity; not an
      American who did not covet a chance to avenge the loss of the
      Philadelphia. But all could not be used, and Decatur finally selected five
      officers and sixty-two men. On the night of the 3rd of February, the
      Intrepid set sail from Syracuse, accompanied by the brig Siren, which was
      to support the boarding party with her boats and cover their retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks later, the Intrepid, barely distinguishable in the light of a
      new moon, drifted into the harbor of Tripoli. In the distance lay the
      unfortunate Philadelphia. The little ketch was now within range of the
      batteries, but she drifted on unmolested until within a hundred yards of
      the frigate. Then a hail came across the quiet bay. The pilot replied that
      he had lost his anchors and asked permission to make fast to the frigate
      for the night. The Tripolitan lookout grumbled assent. Ropes were then
      thrown out and the vessels were drawing together, when the cry
      "Americanas!" went up from the deck of the frigate. In a trice Decatur and
      his men had scrambled aboard and overpowered the crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a crucial moment. If Decatur's instructions had not been
      imperative, he would have thrown prudence to the winds and have tried to
      cut out the frigate and make off in her. There were those, indeed, who
      believed that he might have succeeded. But the Commodore's orders were to
      destroy the frigate. There was no alternative. Combustibles were brought
      on board, the match applied, and in a few moments the frigate was ablaze.
      Decatur and his men had barely time to regain the Intrepid and to cut her
      fasts. The whole affair had not taken more than twenty minutes, and no one
      was killed or even seriously wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulling lustily at their sweeps, the crew of the Intrepid moved her slowly
      out of the harbor, in the light of the burning vessel. The guns of the
      fort were manned at last and were raining shot and shell wildly over the
      harbor. The jack-tars on the Intrepid seemed oblivious to danger,
      "commenting upon the beauty of the spray thrown up by the shot between us
      and the brilliant light of the ship, rather than calculating any danger,"
      wrote Midshipman Morris. Then the starboard guns of the Philadelphia, as
      though instinct with purpose, began to send hot shot into the town. The
      crew yelled with delight and gave three cheers for the redoubtable old
      frigate. It was her last action, God bless her! Her cables soon burned,
      however, and she drifted ashore, there to blow up in one last supreme
      effort to avenge herself. At the entrance of the harbor the Intrepid found
      the boats of the Siren, and three days later both rejoined the squadron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrilling as Decatur's feat was, it brought peace no nearer. The Pasha,
      infuriated by the loss of the Philadelphia, was more exorbitant than ever
      in his demands. There was nothing for it but to scour the Mediterranean
      for Tripolitan ships, maintain the blockade so far as weather permitted,
      and await the opportunity to reduce the city of Tripoli by bombardment.
      But Tripoli was a hard nut to crack. On the ocean side it was protected by
      forts and batteries and the harbor was guarded by a long line of reefs.
      Through the openings in this natural breakwater, the light-draft native
      craft could pass in and out to harass the blockading fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Commodore Preble's plan to make a carefully concerted attack upon
      this stronghold as soon as summer weather conditions permitted. For this
      purpose he had strengthened his squadron at Syracuse by purchasing a
      number of flat-bottomed gunboats with which he hoped to engage the enemy
      in the shallow waters about Tripoli while his larger vessels shelled the
      town and batteries. He arrived off the African coast about the middle of
      July but encountered adverse weather, so that for several weeks he could
      accomplish nothing of consequence. Finally, on the 3rd of August, a
      memorable date in the annals of the American navy, he gave the signal for
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new gunboats were deployed in two divisions, one commanded by Decatur,
      and fully met expectations by capturing two enemy ships in most
      sanguinary, hand-to-hand fighting. Meantime the main squadron drew close
      in shore, so close, it is said, that the gunners of shore batteries could
      not depress their pieces sufficiently to score hits. All these
      preliminaries were watched with bated breath by the officers of the old
      Philadelphia from behind their prison bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pasha had viewed the approach of the American fleet with utter
      disdain. He promised the spectators who lined the terraces that they would
      witness some rare sport; they should see his gunboats put the enemy to
      flight. But as the American gunners began to get the range and pour shot
      into the town, and the Constitution with her heavy ordnance passed and
      repassed, delivering broadsides within three cables' length of the
      batteries, the Pasha's nerves were shattered and he fled precipitately to
      his bomb-proof shelter. No doubt the damage inflicted by this bombardment
      was very considerable, but Tripoli still defied the enemy. Four times
      within the next four weeks Preble repeated these assaults, pausing after
      each bombardment to ascertain what terms the Pasha had to offer; but the
      wily Yusuf was obdurate, knowing well enough that, if he waited, the gods
      of wind and storm would come to his aid and disperse the enemy's fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after the fifth ineffectual assault that Preble determined on a
      desperate stroke. He resolved to fit out a fireship and to send her into
      the very jaws of death, hoping to destroy the Tripolitan gunboats and at
      the same time to damage the castle and the town. He chose for this
      perilous enterprise the old Intrepid which had served her captors so well,
      and out of many volunteers he gave the command to Captain Richard Somers
      and Lieutenant Henry Wadsworth. The little ketch was loaded with a hundred
      barrels of gunpowder and a large quantity of combustibles and made ready
      for a quick run by the batteries into the harbor. Certain death it seemed
      to sail this engine of destruction past the outlying reefs into the midst
      of the Tripolitan gunboats; but every precaution was taken to provide for
      the escape of the crew. Two rowboats were taken along and in these frail
      craft, they believed, they could embark, when once the torch had been
      applied, and in the ensuing confusion return to the squadron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somers selected his crew of ten men with care, and at the last moment
      consented to let Lieutenant Joseph Israel join the perilous expedition. On
      the night of the 4th of September, the Intrepid sailed off in the darkness
      toward the mouth of the harbor. Anxious eyes followed the little vessel,
      trying to pierce the blackness that soon enveloped her. As she neared the
      harbor the shore batteries opened fire; and suddenly a blinding flash and
      a terrific explosion told the fate which overtook her. Fragments of
      wreckage rose high in the air, the fearful concussion was felt by every
      boat in the squadron, and then darkness and awful silence enfolded the
      dead and the dying. Two days later the bodies of the heroic thirteen,
      mangled beyond recognition, were cast up by the sea. Even Captain
      Bainbridge, gazing sorrowfully upon his dead comrades could not recognize
      their features. Just what caused the explosion will never be known. Preble
      always believed that Tripolitans had attempted to board the Intrepid and
      that Somers had deliberately fired the powder magazine rather than
      surrender. Be that as it may, no one doubts that the crew were prepared to
      follow their commander to self-destruction if necessary. In deep gloom,
      the squadron returned to Syracuse, leaving a few vessels to maintain a
      fitful blockade off the hated and menacing coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away from the sound of Commodore Preble's guns a strange, almost
      farcical, intervention in the Tripolitan War was preparing. The scene
      shifts to the desert on the east, where William Eaton, consul at Tunis,
      becomes the center of interest. Since the very beginning of the war, this
      energetic and enterprising Connecticut Yankee had taken a lively interest
      in the fortunes of Hamet Karamanli, the legitimate heir to the throne, who
      had been driven into exile by Yusuf the pretender. Eaton loved intrigue as
      Preble gloried in war. Why not assist Hamet to recover his throne? Why
      not, in frontier parlance, start a back-fire that would make Tripoli too
      hot for Yusuf? He laid his plans before his superiors at Washington, who,
      while not altogether convinced of his competence to play the king-maker,
      were persuaded to make him navy agent, subject to the orders of the
      commander of the American squadron in the Mediterranean. Commodore Samuel
      Barron, who succeeded Preble, was instructed to avail himself of the
      cooperation of the ex-Pasha of Tripoli if he deemed it prudent. In the
      fall of 1804 Barron dispatched Eaton in the Argus, Captain Isaac Hull
      commander, to Alexandria to find Hamet and to assure him of the
      cooperation of the American squadron in the reconquest of his kingdom.
      Eaton entered thus upon the coveted role: twenty centuries looked down
      upon him as they had upon Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mere outline of what followed reads like the scenario of an opera
      bouffe. Eaton ransacked Alexandria in search, of Hamet the unfortunate but
      failed to find the truant. Then acting on a rumor that Hamet had departed
      up the Nile to join the Mamelukes, who were enjoying one of their seasonal
      rebellions against constituted authority, Eaton plunged into the desert
      and finally brought back the astonished and somewhat reluctant heir to the
      throne. With prodigious energy Eaton then organized an expedition which
      was to march overland toward Derne, meet the squadron at the Bay of Bomba,
      and descend vi et armis upon the unsuspecting pretender at Tripoli. He
      even made a covenant with Hamet promising with altogether unwarranted
      explicitness that the United States would use "their utmost exertions" to
      reestablish him in his sovereignty. Eaton was to be "general and
      commander-in-chief of the land forces." This aggressive Yankee alarmed
      Hamet, who clearly did not want his sovereignty badly enough to fight for
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The international army which the American generalissimo mustered was a
      motley array: twenty-five cannoneers of uncertain nationality,
      thirty-eight Greeks, Hamet and his ninety followers, and a party of
      Arabian horsemen and camel-drivers&mdash;all told about four hundred men.
      The story of their march across the desert is a modern Anabasis. When the
      Arabs were not quarreling among themselves and plundering the rest of the
      caravan, they were demanding more pay. Rebuffed they would disappear with
      their camels into the fastnesses of the desert, only to reappear
      unexpectedly with new importunities. Between Hamet, who was in constant
      terror of his life and quite ready to abandon the expedition, and these
      mutinous Arabs, Eaton was in a position to appreciate the vicissitudes of
      Xenophon and his Ten Thousand. No ordinary person, indeed, could have
      surmounted all obstacles and brought his balky forces within sight of
      Derne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supported by the American fleet which had rendezvoused as agreed in the
      Bay of Bomba, the four hundred advanced upon the city. Again the Arab
      contingent would have made off into the desert but for the promise of more
      money. Hamet was torn by conflicting emotions, in which a desire to
      retreat was uppermost. Eaton was, as ever, indefatigable and indomitable.
      When his forces were faltering at the crucial moment, he boldly ordered an
      assault and carried the defenses of the city. The guns of the ships in the
      harbor completed the discomfiture of the enemy, and the international army
      took possession of the citadel. Derne won, however, had to be resolutely
      defended. Twice within the next four weeks, Tripolitan forces were beaten
      back only with the greatest difficulty. The day after the second assault
      (June 10th) the frigate Constellation arrived off Derne with orders which
      rang down the curtain on this interlude in the Tripolitan War. Derne was
      to be evacuated! Peace had been concluded!
    </p>
    <p>
      Just what considerations moved the Administration to conclude peace at a
      moment when the largest and most powerful American fleet ever placed under
      a single command was assembling in the Mediterranean and when the land
      expedition was approaching its objective, has never been adequately
      explained. Had the President's belligerent spirit oozed away as the
      punitive expeditions against Tripoli lost their merely defensive character
      and took on the proportions of offensive naval operations? Had the
      Administration become alarmed at the drain upon the treasury? Or did the
      President wish to have his hands free to deal with those depredations upon
      American commerce committed by British and French cruisers which were
      becoming far more frequent and serious than ever the attacks of the
      Corsairs of the Mediterranean had been? Certain it is that overtures of
      peace from the Pasha were welcomed by the very naval commanders who had
      been most eager to wrest a victory from the Corsairs. Perhaps they, too,
      were wearied by prolonged war with an elusive foe off a treacherous coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      How little prepared the Administration was to sustain a prolonged
      expedition by land against Tripoli to put Hamet on his throne, appears in
      the instructions which Commodore Barron carried to the Mediterranean. If
      he could use Eaton and Hamet to make a diversion, well and good; but he
      was at the same time to assist Colonel Tobias Lear, American
      Consul-General at Algiers, in negotiating terms of peace, if the Pasha
      showed a conciliatory spirit. The Secretary of State calculated that the
      moment had arrived when peace could probably be secured "without any price
      and pecuniary compensation whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such expectations proved quite unwarranted. The Pasha was ready for peace,
      but he still had his price. Poor Bainbridge, writing from captivity,
      assured Barron that the Pasha would never let his prisoners go without a
      ransom. Nevertheless, Commodore Barron determined to meet the overtures
      which the Pasha had made through the Danish consul at Tripoli. On the 24th
      of May he put the frigate Essex at the disposal of Lear, who crossed to
      Tripoli and opened direct negotiations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The treaty which Lear concluded on June 4, 1805, was an inglorious
      document. It purchased peace, it is true, and the release of some three
      hundred sad and woe-begone American sailors. But because the Pasha held
      three hundred prisoners, and the United States only a paltry hundred, the
      Pasha was to receive sixty thousand dollars. Derne was to be evacuated and
      no further aid was to be given to rebellious subjects. The United States
      was to endeavor to persuade Hamet to withdraw from the soil of Tripoli&mdash;no
      very difficult matter&mdash;while the Pasha on his part was to restore
      Hamet's family to him&mdash;at some future time. Nothing was said about
      tribute; but it was understood that according to ancient custom each newly
      appointed consul should carry to the Pasha a present not exceeding six
      thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tripolitan War did not end in a blaze of glory for the United States.
      It had been waged in the spirit of "not a cent for tribute"; it was
      concluded with a thinly veiled payment for peace; and, worst of all, it
      did not prevent further trouble with the Barbary States. The war had been
      prosecuted with vigor under Preble; it had languished under Barron; and it
      ended just when the naval forces were adequate to the task. Yet, from
      another point of view, Preble, Decatur, Somers, and their comrades had not
      fought in vain. They had created imperishable traditions for the American
      navy; they had established a morale in the service; and they had trained a
      group of young officers who were to give a good account of themselves when
      their foes should be not shifty Tripolitans but sturdy Britons.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE SHADOW OF THE FIRST CONSUL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Bainbridge in forlorn captivity at Tripoli, Preble and Barron keeping
      anxious watch off the stormy coast of Africa, Eaton marching through the
      windswept desert, are picturesque figures that arrest the attention of the
      historian; but they seemed like shadowy actors in a remote drama to the
      American at home, absorbed in the humdrum activities of trade and
      commerce. Through all these dreary years of intermittent war, other
      matters engrossed the President and Congress and caught the attention of
      the public. Not the rapacious Pasha of Tripoli but the First Consul of
      France held the center of the stage. At the same time that news arrived of
      the encounter of the Enterprise with the Corsairs came also the
      confirmation of rumors current all winter in Europe. Bonaparte had secured
      from Spain the retrocession of the province of Louisiana. From every point
      of view, as the President remarked, the transfer of this vast province to
      a new master was "an inauspicious circumstance." The shadow of the
      Corsican, already a menace to the peace of Europe, fell across the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange chain of circumstances linked Bonaparte with the New World. When
      he became master of France by the coup d'etat of the 18th Brumaire
      (November 9, 1799), he fell heir to many policies which the republic had
      inherited from the old regime. Frenchmen had never ceased to lament the
      loss of colonial possessions in North America. From time to time the hope
      of reviving the colonial empire sprang up in the hearts of the rulers of
      France. It was this hope that had inspired Genet's mission to the United
      States and more than one intrigue among the pioneers of the Mississippi
      Valley, during Washington's second Administration. The connecting link
      between the old regime and the new was the statesman Talleyrand. He had
      gone into exile in America when the French Revolution entered upon its
      last frantic phase and had brought back to France the plan and purpose
      which gave consistency to his diplomacy in the office of Minister of
      Foreign Affairs, first under the Directory, then under the First Consul.
      Had Talleyrand alone nursed this plan, it would have had little
      significance in history; but it was eagerly taken up by a group of
      Frenchmen who believed that France, having set her house in order and
      secured peace in Europe, should now strive for orderly commercial
      development. The road to prosperity, they believed, lay through the
      acquisition of colonial possessions. The recovery of the province of
      Louisiana was an integral part of their programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Directory was still in power and Bonaparte was pursuing his
      ill-fated expedition in Egypt, Talleyrand had tried to persuade the
      Spanish Court to cede Louisiana and the Floridas. The only way for Spain
      to put a limit to the ambitions of the Americans, he had argued
      speciously, was to shut them up within their natural limits. Only so could
      Spain preserve the rest of her immense domain. But since Spain was
      confessedly unequal to the task, why not let France shoulder the
      responsibility? "The French Republic, mistress of these two provinces,
      will be a wall of brass forever impenetrable to the combined efforts of
      England and America," he assured the Spaniards. But the time was not ripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, was the policy which Bonaparte inherited when he became First
      Consul and master of the destinies of his adopted country. A dazzling
      future opened before him. Within a year he had pacified Europe, crushing
      the armies of Austria by a succession of brilliant victories, and laying
      prostrate the petty states of the Italian peninsula. Peace with England
      was also in sight. Six weeks after his victory at Marengo, Bonaparte sent
      a special courier to Spain to demand&mdash;the word is hardly too strong&mdash;the
      retrocession of Louisiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an odd whim of Fate that left the destiny of half the American
      continent to Don Carlos IV, whom Henry Adams calls "a kind of Spanish
      George III "&mdash;virtuous, to be sure, but heavy, obtuse,
      inconsequential, and incompetent. With incredible fatuousness the King
      gave his consent to a bargain by which he was to yield Louisiana in return
      for Tuscany or other Italian provinces which Bonaparte had just overrun
      with his armies. "Congratulate me," cried Don Carlos to his Prime
      Minister, his eyes sparkling, "on this brilliant beginning of Bonaparte's
      relations with Spain. The Prince-presumptive of Parma, my son-in-law and
      nephew, a Bourbon, is invited by France to reign, on the delightful banks
      of the Arno, over a people who once spread their commerce through the
      known world, and who were the controlling power of Italy,&mdash;a people
      mild, civilized, full of humanity; the classical land of science and art."
      A few war-ridden Italian provinces for an imperial domain that stretched
      from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Superior and that extended westward no one
      knew how far!
    </p>
    <p>
      The bargain was closed by a preliminary treaty signed at San Ildefonso on
      October 1, 1800. Just one year later to a day, the preliminaries of the
      Peace of Amiens were signed, removing the menace of England on the seas.
      The First Consul was now free to pursue his colonial policy, and the
      destiny of the Mississippi Valley hung in the balance. Between the First
      Consul and his goal, however, loomed up the gigantic figure of Toussaint
      L'Ouverture, a full-blooded negro, who had made himself master of Santo
      Domingo and had thus planted himself squarely in the searoad to Louisiana.
      The story of this "gilded African," as Bonaparte contemptuously dubbed
      him, cannot be told in these pages, because it involves no less a theme
      than the history of the French Revolution in this island, once the most
      thriving among the colonial possessions of France in the West Indies. The
      great plantations of French Santo Domingo (the western part of the island)
      had supplied half of Europe with sugar, coffee, and cotton; three-fourths
      of the imports from French-American colonies were shipped from Santo
      Domingo. As the result of class struggles between whites and mulattoes for
      political power, the most terrific slave insurrection in the Western
      Hemisphere had deluged the island in blood. Political convulsions followed
      which wrecked the prosperity of the island. Out of this chaos emerged the
      one man who seemed able to restore a semblance of order&mdash;the Napoleon
      of Santo Domingo, whose character, thinks Henry Adams, had a curious
      resemblance to that of the Corsican. The negro was, however, a ferocious
      brute without the redeeming qualities of the Corsican, though, as a leader
      of his race, his intelligence cannot be denied. Though professing
      allegiance to the French Republic, Toussaint was driven by circumstances
      toward independence. While his Corsican counterpart was executing his coup
      d'etat and pacifying Europe, he threw off the mask, imprisoned the agent
      of the French Directory, seized the Spanish part of the island, and
      proclaimed a new constitution for Santo Domingo, assuming all power for
      himself for life and the right of naming his successor. The negro defied
      the Corsican.
    </p>
    <p>
      The First Consul was now prepared to accept the challenge. Santo Domingo
      must be recovered and restored to its former prosperity&mdash;even if
      slavery had to be reestablished&mdash;before Louisiana could be made the
      center of colonial empire in the West. He summoned Leclerc, a general of
      excellent reputation and husband of his beautiful sister Pauline, and gave
      to him the command of an immense expedition which was already preparing at
      Brest. In the latter part of November, Leclerc set sail with a large fleet
      bearing an army of ten thousand men and on January 29, 1802, arrived off
      the eastern cape of Santo Domingo. A legend says that Toussaint looking
      down on the huge armada exclaimed, "We must perish. All France is coming
      to Santo Domingo. It has been deceived; it comes to take vengeance and
      enslave the blacks." The negro leader made a formidable resistance,
      nevertheless, annihilating one French army and seriously endangering the
      expedition. But he was betrayed by his generals, lured within the French
      lines, made prisoner, and finally sent to France. He was incarcerated in a
      French fortress in the Jura Mountains and there perished miserably in
      1803.
    </p>
    <p>
      The significance of these events in the French West Indies was not lost
      upon President Jefferson. The conquest of Santo Domingo was the prelude to
      the occupation of Louisiana. It would be only a change of European
      proprietors, of absentee landlords, to be sure; but there was a world of
      difference between France, bent upon acquiring a colonial empire and
      quiescent Spain, resting on her past achievements. The difference was
      personified by Bonaparte and Don Carlos. The sovereignty of the lower
      Mississippi country could never be a matter of indifference to those
      settlers of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio who in the year 1799 sent down
      the Mississippi in barges, keel-boats, and flatboats one hundred and
      twenty thousand pounds of tobacco, ten thousand barrels of flour,
      twenty-two thousand pounds of hemp, five hundred barrels of cider, and as
      many more of whiskey, for transshipment and export. The right of
      navigation of the Mississippi was a diplomatic problem bequeathed by the
      Confederation. The treaty with Spain in 1795 had not solved the question,
      though it had established a modus vivendi. Spain had conceded to Americans
      the so-called right of deposit for three years&mdash;that is, the right to
      deposit goods at New Orleans free of duty and to transship them to
      ocean-going vessels; and the concession, though never definitely renewed,
      was tacitly continued. No; the people of the trans-Alleghany country could
      not remain silent and unprotesting witnesses to the retrocession of
      Louisiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Jefferson's interest in the Mississippi problem of recent origin.
      Ten years earlier as Secretary of State, while England and Spain seemed
      about to come to blows over the Nootka Sound affair, he had approached
      both France and Spain to see whether the United States might not acquire
      the island of New Orleans or at least a port near the mouth of the river
      "with a circum-adjacent territory, sufficient for its support,
      well-defined, and extraterritorial to Spain." In case of war, England
      would in all probability conquer Spanish Louisiana. How much better for
      Spain to cede territory on the eastern side of the Mississippi to a safe
      neighbor like the United States and thereby make sure of her possessions
      on the western waters of that river. It was "not our interest," wrote Mr.
      Jefferson, "to cross the Mississippi for ages!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, then, a revival of an earlier idea when President Jefferson,
      officially through Robert R. Livingston, Minister to France, and
      unofficially through a French gentleman, Dupont de Nemours, sought to
      impress upon the First Consul the unwisdom of his taking possession of
      Louisiana, without ceding to the United States at least New Orleans and
      the Floridas as a "palliation." Even so, France would become an object of
      suspicion, a neighbor with whom Americans were bound to quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undeterred by this naive threat, doubtless considering its source, the
      First Consul pressed Don Carlos for the delivery of Louisiana. The King
      procrastinated but at length gave his promise on condition that France
      should pledge herself not to alienate the province. Of course, replied the
      obliging Talleyrand. The King's wishes were identical with the intentions
      of the French government. France would never alienate Louisiana. The First
      Consul pledged his word. On October 15, 1802, Don Carlos signed the order
      that delivered Louisiana to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the President was anxiously awaiting the results of his diplomacy,
      news came from Santo Domingo that Leclerc and his army had triumphed over
      Toussaint and his faithless generals, only to succumb to a far more
      insidious foe. Yellow fever had appeared in the summer of 1802 and had
      swept away the second army dispatched by Bonaparte to take the place of
      the first which had been consumed in the conquest of the island.
      Twenty-four thousand men had been sacrificed at the very threshold of
      colonial empire, and the skies of Europe were not so clear as they had
      been. And then came the news of Leclerc's death (November 2, 1802).
      Exhausted by incessant worry, he too had succumbed to the pestilence; and
      with him, as events proved, passed Bonaparte's dream of colonial empire in
      the New World.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the same time with these tidings a report reached the settlers
      of Kentucky and Tennessee that the Spanish intendant at New Orleans had
      suspended the right of deposit. The Mississippi was therefore closed to
      western commerce. Here was the hand of the Corsican.* Now they knew what
      they had to expect from France. Why not seize the opportunity and strike
      before the French legions occupied the country? The Spanish garrisons were
      weak; a few hundred resolute frontiersmen would speedily overpower them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * It is now clear enough that Bonaparte was not directly
     responsible for this act of the Spanish intendant. See
     Channing, "History of the United States," vol. IV, p. 312,
     and Note, 326-327.
</pre>
    <p>
      Convinced that he must resort to stiffer measures if he would not be
      hurried into hostilities, President Jefferson appointed James Monroe as
      Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary to France and Spain. He
      was to act with Robert Livingston at Paris and with Charles Pinckney,
      Minister to Spain, "in enlarging and more effectually securing our rights
      and interests in the river Mississippi and in the territories eastward
      thereof"&mdash;whatever these vague terms might mean. The President
      evidently read much into them, for he assured Monroe that on the event of
      his mission depended the future destinies of the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months passed before Monroe sailed with his instructions. He had ample
      time to study them, for he was thirty days in reaching the coast of
      France. The first aim of the envoys was to procure New Orleans and the
      Floridas, bidding as high as ten million dollars if necessary. Failing in
      this object, they were then to secure the right of deposit and such other
      desirable concessions as they could. To secure New Orleans, they might
      even offer to guarantee the integrity of Spanish possessions on the west
      bank of the Mississippi. Throughout the instructions ran the assumption
      that the Floridas had either passed with Louisiana into the hands of
      France or had since been acquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the packet bearing Monroe was buffeting stormy seas, the policy of
      Bonaparte underwent a transformation&mdash;an abrupt transformation it
      seemed to Livingston. On the 12th of March the American Minister witnessed
      an extraordinary scene in Madame Bonaparte's drawing-room. Bonaparte and
      Lord Whitworth, the British Ambassador, were in conversation, when the
      First Consul remarked, "I find, my Lord, your nation want war again." "No,
      Sir," replied the Ambassador, "we are very desirous of peace." "I must
      either have Malta or war," snapped Bonaparte. The amazed onlookers soon
      spread the rumor that Europe was again to be plunged into war; but, viewed
      in the light of subsequent events, this incident had even greater
      significance; it marked the end of Bonaparte's colonial scheme. Though the
      motives for this change of front will always be a matter of conjecture,
      they are somewhat clarified by the failure of the Santo Domingo
      expedition. Leclerc was dead; the negroes were again in control; the
      industries of the island were ruined; Rochambeau, Leclerc's successor, was
      clamoring for thirty-five thousand more men to reconquer the island; the
      expense was alarming&mdash;and how meager the returns for this colonial
      venture! Without Santo Domingo, Louisiana would be of little use; and to
      restore prosperity to the West India island&mdash;even granting that its
      immediate conquest were possible&mdash;would demand many years and large
      disbursements. The path to glory did not lie in this direction. In Europe,
      as Henry Adams observes, "war could be made to support war; in Santo
      Domingo peace alone could but slowly repair some part of this frightful
      waste."
    </p>
    <p>
      There may well have been other reasons for Bonaparte's change of front. If
      he read between the lines of a memoir which Pontalba, a wealthy and
      well-informed resident of Louisiana, sent to him, he must have realized
      that this province, too, while it might become an inexhaustible source of
      wealth for France, might not be easy to hold. There was here, it is true,
      no Toussaint L'Ouverture to lead the blacks in insurrection; but there was
      a white menace from the north which was far more serious. These
      Kentuckians, said Pontalba trenchantly, must be watched, cajoled, and
      brought constantly under French influence through agents. There were men
      among them who thought of Louisiana "as the highroad to the conquest of
      Mexico." Twenty or thirty thousand of these westerners on flatboats could
      come down the river and sweep everything before them. To be sure, they
      were an undisciplined horde with slender Military equipment&mdash;a
      striking contrast to the French legions; but, added the Frenchman, "a
      great deal of skill in shooting, the habit of being in the woods and of
      enduring fatigue&mdash;this is what makes up for every deficiency."
    </p>
    <p>
      And if Bonaparte had ever read a remarkable report of the Spanish Governor
      Carondelet, he must have divined that there was something elemental and
      irresistible in this down-the-river-pressure of the people of the West. "A
      carbine and a little maize in a sack are enough for an American to wander
      about in the forests alone for a whole month. With his carbine, he kills
      the wild cattle and deer for food and defends himself from the savages.
      The maize dampened serves him in lieu of bread .... The cold does not
      affright him. When a family tires of one location, it moves to another,
      and there it settles with the same ease. Thus in about eight years the
      settlement of Cumberland has been formed, which is now about to be created
      into a state."
    </p>
    <p>
      On Easter Sunday, 1803, Bonaparte revealed his purpose, which had
      doubtless been slowly maturing, to two of his ministers, one of whom,
      Barbs Marbois, was attached to the United States through residence, his
      devotion to republican principles, and marriage to an American wife. The
      First Consul proposed to cede Louisiana to the United States: he
      considered the colony as entirely lost. What did they think of the
      proposal? Marbois, with an eye to the needs of the Treasury of which he
      was the head, favored the sale of the province; and next day he was
      directed to interview Livingston at once. Before he could do so,
      Talleyrand, perhaps surmising in his crafty way the drift of the First
      Consul's thoughts, startled Livingston by asking what the United States
      would give for the whole of Louisiana. Livingston, who was in truth hard
      of hearing, could not believe his ears. For months he had talked, written,
      and argued in vain for a bit of territory near the mouth of the
      Mississippi, and here was an imperial domain tossed into his lap, as it
      were. Livingston recovered from his surprise sufficiently to name a
      trifling sum which Talleyrand declared too low. Would Mr. Livingston think
      it over? He, Talleyrand, really did not speak from authority. The idea had
      struck him, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some days later in a chance conversation with Marbois, Livingston spoke of
      his extraordinary interview with Talleyrand. Marbois intimated that he was
      not ignorant of the affair and invited Livingston to a further
      conversation. Although Monroe had already arrived in Paris and was now
      apprised of this sudden turn of affairs, Livingston went alone to the
      Treasury Office and there in conversation, which was prolonged until
      midnight, he fenced with Marbois over a fair price for Louisiana. The
      First Consul, said Marbois, demanded one hundred million francs.
      Livingston demurred at this huge sum. The United States did not want
      Louisiana but was willing to give ten million dollars for New Orleans and
      the Floridas. What would the United States give then? asked Marbois.
      Livingston replied that he would have to confer with Monroe. Finally
      Marbois suggested that if they would name sixty million francs, (less than
      $12,000,000) and assume claims which Americans had against the French
      Treasury for twenty million more, he would take the offer under
      advisement. Livingston would not commit himself, again insisting that he
      must consult Monroe.
    </p>
    <p>
      So important did this interview seem to Livingston that he returned to his
      apartment and wrote a long report to Madison without waiting to confer
      with Monroe. It was three o'clock in the morning when he was done. "We
      shall do all we can to cheapen the purchase," he wrote, "but my present
      sentiment is that we shall buy."
    </p>
    <p>
      History does not record what Monroe said when his colleague revealed these
      midnight secrets. But in the prolonged negotiations which followed Monroe,
      though ill, took his part, and in the end, on April 30, 1803, set his hand
      to the treaty which ceded Louisiana to the United States on the terms set
      by Marbois. In two conventions bearing the same date, the commissioners
      bound the United States to pay directly to France the sum of sixty million
      francs ($11,250,000) and to assume debts owed by France to American
      citizens, estimated at not more than twenty million francs ($3,750,000).
      Tradition says that after Marbois, Monroe, and Livingston had signed their
      names, Livingston remarked: "We have lived long, but this is the noblest
      work of our lives.... From this day the United States take their place
      among the powers of the first rank."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V. IN PURSUIT OF THE FLORIDAS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The purchase of Louisiana was a diplomatic triumph of the first magnitude.
      No American negotiators have ever acquired so much for so little; yet,
      oddly enough, neither Livingston nor Monroe had the slightest notion of
      the vast extent of the domain which they had purchased. They had bought
      Louisiana "with the same extent that it is now in the hands of Spain, and
      that it had when France possessed it, and such as it should be after the
      treaties subsequently entered into between Spain and other States," but
      what its actual boundaries were they did not know. Considerably disturbed
      that the treaty contained no definition of boundaries, Livingston sought
      information from the enigmatical Talleyrand. "What are the eastern bounds
      of Louisiana?" he asked. "I do not know," replied Talleyrand; "you must
      take it as we received it." "But what did you mean to take?" urged
      Livingston somewhat naively. "I do not know," was the answer. "Then you
      mean that we shall construe it in our own way?" "I can give you no
      direction," said the astute Frenchman. "You have made a noble bargain for
      yourselves, and I suppose you will make the most of it." And with these
      vague assurances Livingston had to be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first impressions of Jefferson were not much more definite, for, while
      he believed that the acquired territory more than doubled the area of the
      United States, he could only describe it as including all the waters of
      the Missouri and the Mississippi. He started at once, however, to collect
      information about Louisiana. He prepared a list of queries which he sent
      to reputable persons living in or near New Orleans. The task was one in
      which he delighted: to accumulate and diffuse information&mdash;a truly
      democratic mission gave him more real pleasure than to reign in the
      Executive Mansion. His interest in the trans-Mississippi country, indeed,
      was not of recent birth; he had nursed for years an insatiable curiosity
      about the source and course of the Missouri; and in this very year he had
      commissioned his secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to explore the great river
      and its tributaries, to ascertain if they afforded a direct and
      practicable water communication across the continent.

      The outcome of the President's questionnaire was a report submitted to
      Congress in the fall of 1803, which contained much interesting information
      and some entertaining misinformation. The statistical matter we may put to
      one side, as contemporary readers doubtless did; certain impressions are
      worth recording. New Orleans, the first and immediate object of
      negotiations, contained, it would appear, only a small part of the
      population of the province, which numbered some twenty or more rural
      districts. On the river above the city were the plantations of the
      so-called Upper Coast, inhabited mostly by slaves whose Creole masters
      lived in town; then, as one journeyed upstream appeared the first and
      second German Coasts, where dwelt the descendants of those Germans who had
      been brought to the province by John Law's Mississippi Bubble, an
      industrious folk making their livelihood as purveyors to the city. Every
      Friday night they loaded their small craft with produce and held market
      next day on the river front at New Orleans, adding another touch to the
      picturesque groups which frequented the levees. Above the German Coasts
      were the first and second Acadian Coasts, populated by the numerous
      progeny of those unhappy refugees who were expelled from Nova Scotia in
      1755. Acadian settlements were scattered also along the backwaters west of
      the great river: Bayou Lafourche was lined with farms which were already
      producing cotton; near Bayou Teche and Bayou Vermilion&mdash;the Attakapas
      country&mdash;were cattle ranges; and to the north was the richer grazing
      country known as Opelousas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing beyond the Iberville River, which was indeed no river at all but
      only an overflow of the Mississippi, the traveler up-stream saw on his
      right hand "the government of Baton Rouge" with its scattered settlements
      and mixed population of French, Spanish, and Anglo-Americans; and still
      farther on, the Spanish parish of West Feliciana, accounted a part of West
      Florida and described by President Jefferson as the garden of the
      cotton-growing region. Beyond this point the President's description of
      Louisiana became less confident, as reliable sources of information failed
      him. His credulity, however, led him to make one amazing statement, which
      provoked the ridicule of his political opponents, always ready to pounce
      upon the slips of this philosopher-president. "One extraordinary fact
      relative to salt must not be omitted," he wrote in all seriousness. "There
      exists, about one thousand miles up the Missouri, and not far from that
      river, a salt mountain! The existence of such a mountain might well be
      questioned, were it not for the testimony of several respectable and
      enterprising traders who have visited it, and who have exhibited several
      bushels of the salt to the curiosity of the people of St. Louis, where
      some of it still remains. A specimen of the salt has been sent to
      Marietta. This mountain is said to be 180 miles long and 45 in width,
      composed of solid rock salt, without any trees or even shrubs on it." One
      Federalist wit insisted that this salt mountain must be Lot's wife;
      another sent an epigram to the United States Gazette which ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Herostratus of old, to eternalize his name Sat the temple of Diana all in
      a flame; But Jefferson lately of Bonaparte bought, To pickle his fame, a
      mountain of salt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jefferson was too much of a philosopher to be disturbed by such gibes; but
      he did have certain constitutional doubts concerning the treaty. How, as a
      strict constructionist, was he to defend the purchase of territory outside
      the limits of the United States, when the Constitution did not
      specifically grant such power to the Federal Government? He had fought the
      good fight of the year 1800 to oust Federalist administrators who by a
      liberal interpretation were making waste paper of the Constitution.
      Consistency demanded either that he should abandon the treaty or that he
      should ask for the powers which had been denied to the Federal Government.
      He chose the latter course and submitted to his Cabinet and to his
      followers in Congress a draft of an amendment to the Constitution
      conferring the desired powers. To his dismay they treated his proposal
      with indifference, not to say coldness. He pressed his point, redrafted
      his amendment, and urged its consideration once again. Meantime letters
      from Livingston and Monroe warned him that delay was hazardous; the First
      Consul might change his mind, as he was wont to do on slight provocation.
      Privately Jefferson was deeply chagrined, but he dared not risk the loss
      of Louisiana. With what grace he could summon, he acquiesced in the advice
      of his Virginia friends who urged him to let events take their course and
      to drop the amendment, but he continued to believe that such a course if
      persisted in would make blank paper of the Constitution. He could only
      trust, as he said in a letter, "that the good sense of the country will
      correct the evil of construction when it shall produce its ill effects."
    </p>
    <p>
      The debates on the treaty in, Congress make interesting reading for those
      who delight in legal subtleties, for many nice questions of constitutional
      law were involved. Even granting that territory could be acquired, there
      was the further question whether the treaty-making power was competent
      irrespective of the House of Representatives. And what, pray, was meant by
      incorporating this new province in the Union? Was Louisiana to be admitted
      into the Union as a State by President and Senate? Or was it to be
      governed as a dependency? And how could the special privileges given to
      Spanish and French ships in the port of New Orleans be reconciled with
      that provision of the Constitution which, expressly forbade any preference
      to be given, by any regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports of one
      State over those of another? The exigencies of politics played havoc with
      consistency, so that Republicans supported the ratification of the treaty
      with erstwhile Federalist arguments, while Federalists used the old
      arguments of the Republicans. Yet the Senate advised the ratification by a
      decisive vote and with surprising promptness; and Congress passed a
      provisional act authorizing the President to take over and govern the
      territory of Louisiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast province which Napoleon had tossed so carelessly into the lap of
      the young Western Republic was, strangely enough, not yet formally in his
      possession. The expeditionary force under General Victor which was to have
      occupied Louisiana had never left port. M. Pierre Clement Laussat,
      however, who was to have accompanied the expedition to assume the duties
      of prefect in the province, had sailed alone in January, 1803, to receive
      the province from the Spanish authorities. If this lonely Frenchman on
      mission possessed the imagination of his race, he must have had some
      emotional thrills as he reflected that he was following the sea trail of
      La Salle and Iberville through the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. He
      could not have entered the Great River and breasted its yellow current for
      a hundred miles, without seeing in his mind's eye those phantom figures of
      French and Spanish adventurers who had voyaged up and down its turbid
      waters in quest of gold or of distant Cathay. As his vessel dropped anchor
      opposite the town which Bienville had founded, Laussat must have felt that
      in some degree he was "heir of all the ages"; yet he was in fact face to
      face with conditions which, whatever their historic antecedents, were
      neither French nor Spanish. On the water front of New Orleans, he counted
      "forty-five Anglo-American ships to ten French." Subsequent experiences
      deepened this first impression: it was not Spanish nor French influence
      which had made this port important but those "three hundred thousand
      planters who in twenty years have swarmed over the eastern plains of the
      Mississippi and have cultivated them, and who have no other outlet than
      this river and no other port than New Orleans."
    </p>
    <p>
      The outward aspect of the city, however, was certainly not American. From
      the masthead of his vessel Laussat might have seen over a thousand
      dwellings of varied architecture: houses of adobe, houses of brick, houses
      of stucco; some with bright colors, others with the harmonious half tones
      produced by sun and rain. No American artisans constructed the picturesque
      balconies, the verandas, and belvederes which suggested the semitropical
      existence that Nature forced upon these city dwellers for more than half
      the year. No American craftsmen wrought the artistic ironwork of
      balconies, gateways, and window gratings. Here was an atmosphere which
      suggested the Old World rather than the New. The streets which ran at
      right angles were reminiscent of the old regime: Conde, Conti, Dauphine,
      St. Louis, Chartres, Bourbon, Orleans&mdash;all these names were to be
      found within the earthen rampart which formed the defense of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inhabitants were a strange mixture: Spanish, French, American, black,
      quadroon, and Creole. No adequate definition has ever been formulated for
      "Creole," but no one familiar with the type could fail to distinguish this
      caste from those descended from the first French settlers or from the
      Acadians. A keen observer like Laussat discerned speedily that the Creole
      had little place in the commercial life of the city. He was your landed
      proprietor, who owned some of the choicest parts of the city and its
      growing suburbs, and whose plantations lined both banks of the Mississippi
      within easy reach from the city. At the opposite end of the social scale
      were the quadroons&mdash;the demimonde of this little capital&mdash;and
      the negro slaves. Between these extremes were the French and, in
      ever-growing numbers, the Americans who plied every trade, while the
      Spaniards constituted the governing class. Deliberately, in the course of
      time, as befitted a Spanish gentleman and officer, the Marquis de Casa
      Calvo, resplendent with regalia, arrived from Havana to act with Governor
      Don Juan Manuel de Salcedo in transferring the province. A season of
      gayety followed in which the Spaniards did their best to conceal any
      chagrin they may have felt at the relinquishment&mdash;happily, it might
      not be termed the surrender&mdash;of Louisiana. And finally on the 30th of
      November, Governor Salcedo delivered the keys of the city to Laussat, in
      the hall of the Cabildo, while Marquis de Casa Calvo from the balcony
      absolved the people in Place d'Armes below from their allegiance to his
      master, the King of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the brief term of twenty days Louisiana was again a province of
      France. Within that time Laussat bestirred himself to gallicize the
      colony, so far as forms could do so. He replaced the cabildo or hereditary
      council by a municipal council; he restored the civil code; he appointed
      French officers to civil and military posts. And all this he did in the
      full consciousness that American commissioners were already on their way
      to receive from him in turn the province which his wayward master had
      sold. On December 20, 1803, young William Claiborne, Governor of the
      Mississippi Territory, and General James Wilkinson, with a few companies
      of soldiers, entered and received from Laussat the keys of the city and
      the formal surrender of Lower Louisiana. On the Place d'Armes, promptly at
      noon, the tricolor was hauled down and the American Stars and Stripes took
      its place. Louisiana had been transferred for the sixth and last time. But
      what were the metes and bounds of this province which had been so often
      bought and sold? What had Laussat been instructed to take and give? What,
      in short, was Louisiana?
    </p>
    <p>
      The elation which Livingston and Monroe felt at acquiring unexpectedly a
      vast territory beyond the Mississippi soon gave way to a disquieting
      reflection. They had been instructed to offer ten million dollars for New
      Orleans and the Floridas: they had pledged fifteen millions for Louisiana
      without the Floridas. And they knew that it was precisely West Florida,
      with the eastern bank of the Mississippi and the Gulf littoral, that was
      most ardently desired by their countrymen of the West. But might not
      Louisiana include West Florida? Had Talleyrand not professed ignorance of
      the eastern boundary? And had he not intimated that the Americans would
      make the most of their bargain? Within a month Livingston had convinced
      himself that the United States could rightfully claim West Florida to the
      Perdido River, and he soon won over Monroe to his way of thinking. They
      then reported to Madison that "on a thorough examination of the subject"
      they were persuaded that they had purchased West Florida as a part of
      Louisiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what process of reasoning had Livingston and Monroe reached this
      satisfying conclusion? Their argument proceeded from carefully chosen
      premises. France, it was said, had once held Louisiana and the Floridas
      together as part of her colonial empire in America; in 1763 she had ceded
      New Orleans and the territory west of the Mississippi to Spain, and at the
      same time she had transferred the Floridas to Great Britain; in 1783 Great
      Britain had returned the Floridas to Spain which were then reunited to
      Louisiana as under French rule. Ergo, when Louisiana was retro-ceded "with
      the same extent that it now has in the hands of Spain, and that it had
      when France possessed it," it must have included West Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Livingston was able to convince himself by this logic, does not speak
      well for his candor or intelligence. He was well aware that Bonaparte had
      failed to persuade Don Carlos to include the Floridas in the retrocession;
      he had tried to insert in the treaty an article pledging the First Consul
      to use his good offices to obtain the Floridas for the United States; and
      in his midnight dispatch to Madison, with the prospect of acquiring
      Louisiana before him, he had urged the advisability of exchanging this
      province for the more desirable Floridas. Livingston therefore could not,
      and did not, say that Spain intended to cede the Floridas as a part of
      Louisiana, but that she had inadvertently done so and that Bonaparte might
      have claimed West Florida, if he had been shrewd enough to see his
      opportunity. The United States was in no way prevented from pressing this
      claim because the First Consul had not done so. The fact that France had
      in 1763 actually dismembered her colonial empire and that Louisiana as
      ceded to Spain extended only to the Iberville, was given no weight in
      Livingston's deductions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having the will to believe, Jefferson and Madison became converts to
      Livingston's faith. Madison wrote at once that in view of these
      developments no proposal to exchange Louisiana for the Floridas should be
      entertained; the President declared himself satisfied that "our right to
      the Perdido is substantial and can be opposed by a quibble on form only";
      and John Randolph, duly coached by the Administration, flatly declared in
      the House of Representatives that "We have not only obtained the command
      of the mouth of the Mississippi, but of the Mobile, with its widely
      extended branches; and there is not now a single stream of note rising
      within the United States and falling into the Gulf of Mexico which is not
      entirely our own, the Appalachicola excepted." From this moment to the end
      of his administration, the acquisition of West Florida became a sort of
      obsession with Jefferson. His pursuit of this phantom claim involved
      American diplomats in strange adventures and at times deflected the whole
      course of domestic politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first luckless minister to engage in this baffling quest was James
      Monroe, who had just been appointed Minister to the Court of St. James. He
      was instructed to take up the threads of diplomacy at Madrid where they
      were getting badly tangled in the hands of Charles Pinckney, who was a
      better politician than a diplomat. "Your inquiries may also be directed,"
      wrote Madison, "to the question whether any, and how much, of what passes
      for West Florida be fairly included in the territory ceded to us by
      France." Before leaving Paris on this mission, Monroe made an effort to
      secure the good offices of the Emperor, but he found Talleyrand cold and
      cynical as ever. He was given to understand that it was all a question of
      money; if the United States were willing to pay the price, the Emperor
      could doubtless have the negotiations transferred to Paris and put the
      deal through. A loan of seventy million livres to Spain, which would be
      passed over at once to France, would probably put the United States into
      possession of the coveted territory. As an honest man Monroe shrank from
      this sort of jobbery; besides, he could hardly offer to buy a territory
      which his Government asserted it had already bought with Louisiana. With
      the knowledge that he was defying Napoleon, or at least his ministers, he
      started for Madrid to play a lone hand in what he must have known was a
      desperate game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conduct of the Administration during the next few months was hardly
      calculated to smooth Monroe's path. In the following February (1804)
      President Jefferson put his signature to an act which was designed to give
      effect to the laws of the United States in the newly acquired territory.
      The fourth section of this so-called Mobile Act included explicitly within
      the revenue district of Mississippi all the navigable waters lying within
      the United States and emptying into the Gulf east of the Mississippi&mdash;an
      extraordinary provision indeed, since unless the Floridas were a part of
      the United States there were no rivers within the limits of the United
      States emptying into the Gulf east of the Mississippi. The eleventh
      section was even more remarkable since it gave the President authority to
      erect Mobile Bay and River into a separate revenue district and to
      designate a port of entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cool appropriation of Spanish territory was too much for the
      excitable Spanish Minister, Don Carlos Martinez Yrujo, who burst into
      Madison's office one morning with a copy of the act in his hand and with
      angry protests on his lips. He had been on excellent terms with Madison
      and had enjoyed Jefferson's friendship and hospitality at Monticello; but
      he was the accredited representative of His Catholic Majesty and bound to
      defend his sovereignty. He fairly overwhelmed the timid Madison with
      reproaches that could never be forgiven or forgotten; and from this moment
      he was persona non grata in the Department of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madison doubtless took Yrujo's reproaches more to heart just because he
      felt himself in a false position. The Administration had allowed the
      transfer of Louisiana to be made in the full knowledge that Laussat had
      been instructed to claim Louisiana as far as the Rio Bravo on the west but
      only as far as the Iberville on the east. Laussat had finally admitted as
      much confidentially to the American commissioners. Yet the Administration
      had not protested. And now it was acting on the assumption that it might
      dispose of the Gulf littoral, the West Florida coast, as it pleased.
      Madison was bound to admit in his heart of hearts that Yrujo had reason to
      be angry. A few weeks later the President relieved the tense situation,
      though at the price of an obvious evasion, by issuing a proclamation which
      declared all the shores and waters "lying <i>Within the Boundaries of The
      United States</i>" * to be a revenue district with Fort Stoddert as the
      port of entry. But the mischief had been done and no constructive
      interpretation of the act by the President could efface the impression
      first made upon the mind of Yrujo. Congress had meant to appropriate West
      Florida and the President had suffered the bill to become law.

    <p>
      Nor was Pinckney's conduct at Madrid likely to make Monroe's mission
      easier. Two years before, in 1802, he had negotiated a convention by which
      Spain agreed to pay indemnity for depredations committed by her cruisers
      in the late war between France and the United States. This convention had
      been ratified somewhat tardily by the Senate and now waited on the
      pleasure of the Spanish Government. Pinckney was instructed to press for
      the ratification by Spain, which was taken for granted; but he was
      explicitly warned to leave the matter of the Florida claims to Monroe.
      When he presented the demands of his Government to Cevallos, the Foreign
      Minister, he was met in turn with a demand for explanations. What, pray,
      did his Government mean by this act? To Pinckney's astonishment, he was
      confronted with a copy of the Mobile Act, which Yrujo had forwarded. The
      South Carolinian replied, in a tone that was not calculated to soothe
      ruffled feelings, that he had already been advised that West Florida was
      included in the Louisiana purchase and had so reported to Cevallos. He
      urged that the two subjects be kept separate and begged His Excellency to
      have confidence in the honor and justice of the United States. Delays
      followed until Cevallos finally, declared sharply that the treaty would be
      ratified only on several conditions, one of which was that the Mobile Act
      should be revoked. Pinckney then threw discretion to the winds and
      announced that he would ask for his passports; but his bluster did not
      change Spanish policy, and he dared not carry out his threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was under these circumstances that Monroe arrived in Madrid on his
      difficult mission. He was charged with the delicate task of persuading a
      Government whose pride had been touched to the quick to ratify the claims
      convention, to agree to a commission to adjudicate other claims which it
      had refused to recognize, to yield West Florida as a part of the Louisiana
      purchase, and to accept two million dollars for the rest of Florida east
      of the Perdido River. In preparing these extraordinary instructions, the
      Secretary of State labored under the hallucination that Spain, on the
      verge of war with England, would pay handsomely for the friendship of the
      United States, quite forgetting that the real master of Spain was at
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of Monroe's five weary months in Spain may be briefly told. He
      was in the unstrategic position of one who asks for everything and can
      concede nothing. Only one consideration could probably have forced the
      Spanish Government to yield, and that was fear. Spain had now declared war
      upon England and might reasonably be supposed to prefer a solid
      accommodation with the United States, as Madison intimated, rather than
      add to the number of her foes. But Cevallos exhibited no signs of fear; on
      the contrary he professed an amiable willingness to discuss every point at
      great length. Every effort on the part of the American to reach a
      conclusion was adroitly eluded. It was a game in which the Spaniard had no
      equal. At last, when indubitable assurances came to Monroe from Paris that
      Napoleon would not suffer Spain to make the slightest concession either in
      the matter of spoliation claims or any other claims, and that, in the
      event of a break between the United States and Spain, he would surely take
      the part of Spain, Monroe abandoned the game and asked for his passports.
      Late in May he returned to Paris, where he joined with General Armstrong,
      who had succeeded Livingston, in urging upon the Administration the
      advisability of seizing Texas, leaving West Florida alone for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Months of vacillation followed the failure of Monroe's mission. The
      President could not shake off his obsession, and yet he lacked the
      resolution to employ force to take either Texas, which he did not want but
      was entitled to, or West Florida which he ardently desired but whose title
      was in dispute. It was not until November of the following year (1805)
      that the Administration determined on a definite policy. In a meeting of
      the Cabinet "I proposed," Jefferson recorded in a memorandum, "we should
      address ourselves to France, informing her it was a last effort at
      amicable settlement with Spain and offer to her, or through her," a sum
      not to exceed five million dollars for the Floridas. The chief obstacle in
      the way of this programme was the uncertain mood of Congress, for a vote
      of credit was necessary and Congress might not take kindly to Napoleon as
      intermediary. Jefferson then set to work to draft a message which would
      "alarm the fears of Spain by a vigorous language, in order to induce her
      to join us in appealing to the interference of the Emperor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The message sent to Congress alluded briefly to the negotiations with
      Spain and pointed out the unsatisfactory relations which still obtained.
      Spain had shown herself unwilling to adjust claims or the boundaries of
      Louisiana; her depredations on American commerce had been renewed;
      arbitrary duties and vexatious searches continued to obstruct American
      shipping on the Mobile; inroads had been made on American territory;
      Spanish officers and soldiers had seized the property of American
      citizens. It was hoped that Spain would view these injuries in their
      proper light; if not, then the United States "must join in the
      unprofitable contest of trying which party can do the other the most harm.
      Some of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy. Where that is
      competent, it is always the most desirable. But some of them are of a
      nature to be met by force only, and all of them may lead to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming from the pen of a President who had declared that peace was his
      passion, these belligerent words caused some bewilderment but, on the
      whole, very considerable satisfaction in Republican circles, where the
      possibility of rupture had been freely discussed. The people of the
      Southwest took the President at his word and looked forward with
      enthusiasm to a war which would surely overthrow Spanish rule in the
      Floridas and yield the coveted lands along the Gulf of Mexico. The country
      awaited with eagerness those further details which the President had
      promised to set forth in another message. These were felt to be historic
      moments full of dramatic possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, behind closed doors, Congress listened to the special
      message which was to put the nation to the supreme test. Alas for those
      who had expected a trumpet call to battle. Never was a state paper better
      calculated to wither martial spirit. In dull fashion it recounted the
      events of Monroe's unlucky mission and announced the advance of Spanish
      forces in the Southwest, which, however, the President had not repelled,
      conceiving that "Congress alone is constitutionally invested with the
      power of changing our condition from peace to war." He had "barely
      instructed" our forces "to patrol the borders actually delivered to us."
      It soon dawned upon the dullest intelligence that the President had not
      the slightest intention to recommend a declaration of war. On the
      contrary, he was at pains to point out the path to peace. There was reason
      to believe that France was now disposed to lend her aid in effecting a
      settlement with Spain, and "not a moment should be lost in availing
      ourselves of it." "Formal war is not necessary, it is not probable it will
      follow; but the protection of our citizens, the spirit and honor of our
      country, require that force should be interposed to a certain degree. It
      will probably contribute to advance the object of peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the warlike tone of the first message, this sounded like a retreat.
      It outraged the feelings of the war party. It was, to their minds, an
      anticlimax, a pusillanimous surrender. None was angrier than John Randolph
      of Virginia, hitherto the leader of the forces of the Administration in
      the House. He did not hesitate to express his disgust with "this double
      set of opinions and principles"; and his anger mounted when he learned
      that as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means he was expected to
      propose and carry through an appropriation of two million dollars for the
      purchase of Florida. Further interviews with the President and the
      Secretary of State did not mollify him, for, according to his version of
      these conversations, he was informed that France would not permit Spain to
      adjust her differences with the United States, which had, therefore, the
      alternative of paying France handsomely or of facing a war with both
      France and Spain. Then Randolph broke loose from all restraint and swore
      by all his gods that he would not assume responsibility for "delivering
      the public purse to the first cut-throat that demanded it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Randolph's opposition to the Florida programme was more than an unpleasant
      episode in Jefferson's administration; it proved to be the beginning of a
      revolt which was fatal to the President's diplomacy, for Randolph passed
      rapidly from passive to active opposition and fought the two-million
      dollar bill to the bitter end. When the House finally outvoted him and his
      faction, soon to be known as the "Quids," and the Senate had concurred,
      precious weeks had been lost. Yet Madison must bear some share of blame
      for the delay since, for some reason, never adequately explained, he did
      not send instructions to Armstrong until four weeks after the action of
      Congress. It was then too late to bait the master of Europe. Just what had
      happened Armstrong could not ascertain; but when Napoleon set out in
      October, 1806, on that fateful campaign which crushed Prussia at Jena and
      Auerstadt, the chance of acquiring Florida had passed.

      CHAPTER VI. AN AMERICAN CATILINE
    </h2>
    <p>
      With the transfer of Louisiana, the United States entered upon its first
      experience in governing an alien civilized people. At first view there is
      something incongruous in the attempt of the young Republic, founded upon
      the consent of the governed, to rule over a people whose land had been
      annexed without their consent and whose preferences in the matter of
      government had never been consulted. The incongruity appears the more
      striking when it is recalled that the author of the Declaration of
      Independence was now charged with the duty of appointing all officers,
      civil and military, in the new territory. King George III had never ruled
      more autocratically over any of his North American colonies than President
      Jefferson over Louisiana through Governor William Claiborne and General
      James Wilkinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaders among the Creoles and better class of Americans counted on a
      speedy escape from this autocratic government, which was confessedly
      temporary. The terms of the treaty, indeed, encouraged the hope that
      Louisiana would be admitted at once as a State. The inhabitants of the
      ceded territory were to be "incorporated into the Union." But Congress
      gave a different interpretation to these words and dashed all hopes by the
      act of 1804, which, while it conceded a legislative council, made its
      members and all officers appointive, and divided the province. A
      delegation of Creoles went to Washington to protest against this
      inconsiderate treatment. They bore a petition which contained many
      stiletto-like thrusts at the President. What about those elemental rights
      of representation and election which had figured in the glorious contest
      for freedom? "Do political axioms on the Atlantic become problems when
      transferred to the shores of the Mississippi?" To such arguments Congress
      could not remain wholly indifferent. The outcome was a third act (March 2,
      1805) which established the usual form of territorial government, an
      elective legislature, a delegate in Congress, and a Governor appointed by
      the President. To a people who had counted on statehood these concessions
      were small pinchbeck. Their irritation was not allayed, and it continued
      to focus upon Governor Claiborne, the distrusted agent of a government
      which they neither liked nor respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange currents and counter-currents ran through the life of this distant
      province. Casa Calvo and Morales, the former Spanish officials, continued
      to reside in the city, like spiders at the center of a web of Spanish
      intrigue; and the threads of their web extended to West Florida, where
      Governor Folch watched every movement of Americans up and down the
      Mississippi, and to Texas, where Salcedo, Captain-General of the Internal
      Provinces of Mexico, waited for overt aggressions from land-hungry
      American frontiersmen. All these Spanish agents knew that Monroe had left
      Madrid empty-handed yet still asserting claims that were ill-disguised
      threats; but none of them knew whether the impending blow would fall upon
      West Florida or Texas. Then, too, right under their eyes was the Mexican
      Association, formed for the avowed purpose of collecting information about
      Mexico which would be useful if the United States should become involved
      in war with Spain. In the city, also, were adventurous individuals ready
      for any daring move upon Mexico, where, according to credible reports, a
      revolution was imminent. The conquest of Mexico was the day-dream of many
      an adventurer. In his memoir advising Bonaparte to take and hold Louisiana
      as an impenetrable barrier to Mexico, Pontalba had said with strong
      conviction: "It is the surest means of destroying forever the bold schemes
      with which several individuals in the United States never cease filling
      the newspapers, by designating Louisiana as the highroad to the conquest
      of Mexico."
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this web of intrigue walked the late Vice-President of the United
      States, leisurely journeying through the Southwest in the summer of 1805.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aaron Burr is one of the enigmas of American politics. Something of the
      mystery and romance that shroud the evil-doings of certain Italian despots
      of the age of the Renaissance envelops him. Despite the researches of
      historians, the tangled web of Burr's conspiracy has never been unraveled.
      It remains the most fascinating though, perhaps, the least important
      episode in Jefferson's administration. Yet Burr himself repays study, for
      his activities touch many sides of contemporary society and illuminate
      many dark corners in American politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the principles of eugenics, Burr was well-born, and by all
      the laws of this pseudo-science should have left an honorable name behind
      him. His father was a Presbyterian clergyman, sound in the faith, who
      presided over the infancy of the College of New Jersey; his maternal
      grandfather was that massive divine, Jonathan Edwards. After graduating at
      Princeton, Burr began to study law but threw aside his law books on
      hearing the news of Lexington. He served with distinction under Arnold
      before Quebec, under Washington in the battle of Long Island, and later at
      Monmouth, and retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1779. Before
      the close of the Revolution he had begun the practice of law in New York,
      and had married the widow of a British army officer; entering politics, he
      became in turn a member of the State Assembly, Attorney-General, and
      United States Senator. But a mere enumeration of such details does not
      tell the story of Burr's life and character. Interwoven with the strands
      of his public career is a bewildering succession of intrigues and
      adventures in which women have a conspicuous part, for Burr was a
      fascinating man and disarmed distrust by avoiding any false assumption of
      virtue. His marriage, however, proved happy. He adored his wife and fairly
      worshiped his strikingly beautiful daughter Theodosia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burr throve in the atmosphere of intrigue. New York politics afforded his
      proper milieu. How he ingratiated himself with politicians of high and low
      degree; how he unlocked the doors to political preferment; how he became
      one of the first bosses of the city of New York; how he combined public
      service with private interest; how he organized the voters&mdash;no
      documents disclose. Only now and then the enveloping fog lifts, as, for
      example, during the memorable election of 1800, when the ignorant voters
      of the seventh ward, duly drilled and marshaled, carried the city for the
      Republicans, and not even Colonel Hamilton, riding on his white horse from
      precinct to precinct, could stay the rout. That election carried New York
      for Jefferson and made Burr the logical candidate of the party for
      Vice-President.
    </p>
    <p>
      These political strokes betoken a brilliant if not always a steady and
      reliable mind. Burr, it must be said, was not trusted even by his
      political associates. It is significant that Washington, a keen judge of
      men, refused to appoint Burr as Minister to France to succeed Morris
      because he was not convinced of his integrity. And Jefferson shared these
      misgivings, though the exigencies of politics made him dissemble his
      feelings. It is significant, also, that Burr was always surrounded by men
      of more than doubtful intentions&mdash;place-hunters and self-seeking
      politicians, who had the gambler's instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Vice-President, Burr could not hope to exert much influence upon the
      Administration, since the office in itself conferred little power and did
      not even, according to custom, make him a member of the Cabinet; but as
      Republican boss of New York who had done more than any one man to secure
      the election of the ticket in 1800, he might reasonably expect Jefferson
      and his Virginia associates to treat him with consideration in the
      distribution of patronage. To his intense chagrin, he was ignored; not
      only ignored but discredited, for Jefferson deliberately allied himself
      with the Clintons and the Livingstons, the rival factions in New York
      which were bent upon driving Burr from the party. This treatment filled
      Burr's heart with malice; but he nursed his wounds in secret and bided his
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Realizing that he was politically bankrupt, Burr made a hazard of new
      fortunes in 1804 by offering himself as candidate for Governor of New
      York, an office then held by George Clinton. Early in the year he had a
      remarkable interview with Jefferson in which he observed that it was for
      the interest of the party for him to retire, but that his retirement under
      existing circumstances would be thought discreditable. He asked "some mark
      of favor from me," Jefferson wrote in his journal, "which would declare to
      the world that he retired with my confidence"&mdash;an executive
      appointment, in short. This was tantamount to an offer of peace or war.
      Jefferson declined to gratify him, and Burr then began an intrigue with
      the Federalist leaders of New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rise of a Republican party of challenging strength in New England cast
      Federalist leaders into the deepest gloom. Already troubled by the
      annexation of Louisiana, which seemed to them to imperil the ascendancy of
      New England in the Union, they now saw their own ascendancy in New England
      imperiled. Under the depression of impending disaster, men like Senator
      Timothy Pickering of Massachusetts and Roger Griswold of Connecticut
      broached to their New England friends the possibility of a withdrawal from
      the Union and the formation of a Northern Confederacy. As the confederacy
      shaped itself in Pickering's imagination, it would of necessity include
      New York; and the chaotic conditions in New York politics at this time
      invited intrigue. When, therefore, a group of Burr's friends in the
      Legislature named him as their candidate for Governor, Pickering and
      Griswold seized the moment to approach him with their treasonable plans.
      They gave him to understand that as Governor of New York he would
      naturally hold a strategic position and could, if he would, take the lead
      in the secession of the Northern States. Federalist support could be given
      to him in the approaching election. They would be glad to know his views.
      But the shifty Burr would not commit himself further than to promise a
      satisfactory administration. Though the Federalist intriguers would have
      been glad of more explicit assurances they counted on his vengeful temper
      and hatred of the Virginia domination at Washington to make him a pliable
      tool. They were willing to commit the party openly to Burr and trust to
      events to bind him to their cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against this mad intrigue one clear-headed individual resolutely set
      himself&mdash;not wholly from disinterested motives. Alexander Hamilton
      had good reason to know Burr. He declared in private conversation, and the
      remark speedily became public property, that he looked upon Burr as a
      dangerous man who ought not to be trusted with the reins of government. He
      pleaded with New York Federalists not to commit the fatal blunder of
      endorsing Burr in caucus, and he finally won his point; but he could not
      prevent his partisans from supporting Burr at the polls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defeat of Burr dashed the hopes of the Federalists of New England; the
      bubble of a Northern Confederacy vanished. It dashed also Burr's personal
      ambitions: he could no longer hope for political rehabilitation in New
      York. And the man who a second time had crossed his path and thwarted his
      purposes was his old rival, Alexander Hamilton. It is said that Burr was
      not naturally vindictive: perhaps no man is naturally vindictive. Certain
      it is that bitter disappointment had now made Burr what Hamilton had
      called him&mdash;"a dangerous man." He took the common course of men of
      honor at this time; he demanded prompt and unqualified acknowledgment or
      denial of the expression. Well aware of what lay behind this demand,
      Hamilton replied deliberately with half-conciliatory words, but he ended
      with the usual words of those prepared to accept a challenge, "I can only
      regret the circumstance, and must abide the consequences." A challenge
      followed. We are told that Hamilton accepted to save his political
      leadership and influence&mdash;strange illusion in one so gifted! Yet
      public opinion had not yet condemned dueling, and men must be judged
      against the background of their times.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a summer morning (July 11, 1804) Burr and Hamilton crossed the Hudson
      to Weehawken and there faced each other for the last time. Hamilton
      withheld his fire; Burr aimed with murderous intent, and Hamilton fell
      mortally wounded. The shot from Burr's pistol long reverberated. It woke
      public conscience to the horror and uselessness of dueling, and left Burr
      an outlaw from respectable society, stunned by the recoil, and under
      indictment for murder. Only in the South and West did men treat the
      incident lightly as an affair of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political career of Burr was now closed. When he again met the Senate
      face to face, he had been dropped by his own party in favor of George
      Clinton, to whom he surrendered the Vice-Presidency on March 5, 1805. His
      farewell address is described as one of the most affecting ever spoken in
      the Senate. Describing the scene to his daughter, Burr said that tears
      flowed abundantly, but Burr must have described what he wished to see.
      American politicians are not Homeric heroes, who weep on slight
      provocation; and any inclination to pity Burr must have been inhibited by
      the knowledge that he had made himself the rallying-point of every dubious
      intrigue at the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of Burr's intimates included Jonathan Dayton, whose term as
      Senator had just ended, and who, like Burr, sought means of promoting his
      fortunes, John Smith, Senator from Ohio, the notorious Swartwouts of New
      York who were attached to Burr as gangsters to their chief, and General
      James Wilkinson, governor of the northern territory carved out of
      Louisiana and commander of the western army with headquarters at St.
      Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilkinson had a long record of duplicity, which was suspected but never
      proved by his contemporaries. There was hardly a dubious episode from the
      Revolution to this date with which he had not been connected. He was
      implicated in the Conway cabal against Washington; he was active in the
      separatist movement in Kentucky during the Confederation; he entered into
      an irregular commercial agreement with the Spanish authorities at New
      Orleans; he was suspected&mdash;and rightly, as documents recently
      unearthed in Spain prove&mdash;of having taken an oath of allegiance to
      Spain and of being in the pay of Spain; he was also suspected&mdash;and
      justly&mdash;of using his influence to bring about a separation of the
      Western States from the Union; yet in 1791 he was given a
      lieutenant-colonel's commission in the regular army and served under St.
      Clair in the Northwest, and again as a brigadier-general under Wayne. Even
      here the atmosphere of intrigue enveloped him, and he was accused of
      inciting discontent among the Kentucky troops and of trying to supplant
      Wayne. When commissioners were trying to run the Southern boundary in
      accordance with the treaty of 1795 with Spain, Wilkinson&mdash;still a
      pensioner of Spain, as documents prove&mdash;attempted to delay the
      survey. In the light of these revelations, Wilkinson appears as an
      unscrupulous adventurer whose thirst for lucre made him willing to betray
      either master&mdash;the Spaniard who pensioned him or the American who
      gave him his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1805 Burr made a leisurely journey across the mountains,
      by way of Pittsburgh, to New Orleans, where he had friends and personal
      followers. The secretary of the territory was one of his henchmen; a
      justice of the superior court was his stepson; the Creole petitionists who
      had come to Washington to secure self-government had been cordially
      received by Burr and had a lively sense of gratitude. On his way down the
      Ohio, Burr landed at Blennerhassett's Island, where an eccentric Irishman
      of that name owned an estate. Harman Blennerhassett was to rue the day
      that he entertained this fascinating guest. At Cincinnati he was the guest
      of Senator Smith, and there he also met Dayton. At Nashville he visited
      General Andrew Jackson, who was thrilled with the prospect of war with
      Spain; at Fort Massac he spent four days in close conference with General
      Wilkinson; and at New Orleans he consorted with Daniel Clark, a rich
      merchant and the most uncompromising opponent of Governor Claiborne, and
      with members of the Mexican Association and every would-be adventurer and
      filibuster. In November, Burr was again in Washington. What was the
      purpose of this journey and what did it accomplish?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is far easier to tell what Burr did after this mysterious western
      expedition than what he planned to do. There is danger of reading too
      great consistency into his designs. At one moment, if we may believe
      Anthony Merry, the British Minister, who lent an ear to Burr's proposals,
      he was plotting a revolution which should separate the Western States from
      the Union. To accomplish this design he needed British funds and a British
      naval force. Jonathan Dayton revealed to Yrujo much the same plot&mdash;which
      he thought was worth thirty or forty thousand dollars to the Spanish
      Government. To such urgent necessity for funds were the conspirators
      driven. But Dayton added further details to the story which may have been
      intended only to intimidate Yrujo. The revolution effected by British aid,
      said Dayton gravely, an expedition would be undertaken against Mexico.
      Subsequently Dayton unfolded a still more remarkable tale. Burr had been
      disappointed in the expectation of British aid, and he was now bent upon
      "an almost insane plan," which was nothing less than the seizure of the
      Government at Washington. With the government funds thus obtained, and
      with the necessary frigates, the conspirators would sail for New Orleans
      and proclaim the independence of Louisiana and the Western States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kernel of truth in these accounts is not easily separated from the
      chaff. The supposition that Burr seriously contemplated a separation of
      the Western States from the Union may be dismissed from consideration. The
      loyalty of the Mississippi Valley at this time is beyond question; and
      Burr was too keen an observer not to recognize the temper of the people
      with whom he sojourned. But there is reason to believe that he and his
      confederates may have planned an enterprise against Mexico, for such a
      project was quite to the taste of Westerners who hated Spain as ardently
      as they loved the Union. Circumstances favored a filibustering expedition.
      The President's bellicose message of December had prepared the people of
      the Mississippi Valley for war; the Spanish plotters had been expelled
      from Louisiana; Spanish forces had crossed the Sabine; American troops had
      been sent to repel them if need be; the South American revolutionist
      Miranda had sailed, with vessels fitted out in New York, to start a revolt
      against Spanish rule in Caracas; every revolutionist in New Orleans was on
      the qui vive. What better time could there be to launch a filibustering
      expedition against Mexico? If it succeeded and a republic were
      established, the American Government might be expected to recognize a fait
      accompli.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of Burr's plans, whatever they may have been, depended on his
      procuring funds; and it was doubtless the hope of extracting aid from
      Blennerhassett that drew him to the island in midsummer of 1806. Burr was
      accompanied by his daughter Theodosia and her husband, Joseph Alston, a
      wealthy South Carolina planter, who was either the dupe or the accomplice
      of Burr. Together they persuaded the credulous Irishman to purchase a
      tract of land on the Washita River in the heart of Louisiana, which would
      ultimately net him a profit of a million dollars when Louisiana became an
      independent state with Burr as ruler and England as protector. They even
      assured Blennerhassett that he should go as minister to England. He was so
      dazzled at the prospect that he not only made the initial payment for the
      lands, but advanced all his property for Burr's use on receiving a
      guaranty from Alston. Having landed his fish, Burr set off down the river
      to visit General Jackson at Nashville and to procure boats and supplies
      for his expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Theodosia&mdash;the brilliant, fascinating Theodosia&mdash;and
      her husband played the game at Blennerhassett's Island. Blennerhassett's
      head was completely turned. He babbled most indiscreetly about the
      approaching coup d'etat. Colonel Burr would be king of Mexico, he told his
      gardener, and Mrs. Alston would be queen when Colonel Burr died. Who could
      resist the charms of this young princess? Blennerhassett and his wife were
      impatient to exchange their little isle for marble halls in far away
      Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all was not going well with the future Emperor of Mexico. Ugly rumors
      were afloat. The active preparations at Blennerhassett's Island, the
      building of boats at various points along the river, the enlistment of
      recruits, coupled with hints of secession, disturbed such loyal citizens
      as the District-Attorney at Frankfort, Kentucky. He took it upon himself
      to warn the President, and then, in open court, charged Burr with
      violating the laws of the United States by setting on foot a military
      expedition against Mexico and with inciting citizens to rebellion in the
      Western States. But at the meeting of the grand jury Burr appeared
      surrounded by his friends and with young Henry Clay for counsel. The grand
      jury refused to indict him and he left the court in triumph. Some weeks
      later the District-Attorney renewed his motion; but again Burr was
      discharged by the grand jury, amid popular applause. Enthusiastic admirers
      in Frankfort even gave a ball in his honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding these warnings of conspiracy, President Jefferson
      exhibited a singular indifference and composure. To all alarmists he made
      the same reply. The people of the West were loyal and could be trusted. It
      was not until disquieting and ambiguous messages from Wilkinson reached
      Washington-disquieting because ambiguous&mdash;that the President was
      persuaded to act. On the 27th of November, he issued a proclamation
      warning all good citizens that sundry persons were conspiring against
      Spain and enjoining all Federal officers to apprehend those engaged in the
      unlawful enterprise. The appearance of this proclamation at Nashville
      should have led to Burr's arrest, for he was still detained there; but
      mysterious influences seemed to paralyze the arm of the Government. On the
      22d of December, Burr set off, with two boats which Jackson had built and
      some supplies, down the Cumberland. At the mouth of the river, he joined
      forces with Blennerhassett, who had left his island in haste just as the
      Ohio militia was about to descend upon him. The combined strength of the
      flotilla was nine bateaux carrying less than sixty men. There was still
      time to intercept the expedition at Fort Massac, but again delays that
      have never been explained prevented the President's proclamation from
      arriving in time; and Burr's little fleet floated peacefully by down
      stream.

    <p>
      The scene now shifts to the lower Mississippi, and the heavy villain of
      the melodrama appears on the stage in the uniform of a United States
      military officer&mdash;General James Wilkinson. He had been under orders
      since May 6, 1806, to repair to the Territory of Orleans with as little
      delay as possible and to repel any invasion east of the River Sabine; but
      it was now September and he had only just reached Natchitoches, where the
      American volunteers and militiamen from Louisiana and Mississippi were
      concentrating. Much water had flowed under the bridge since Aaron Burr
      visited New Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      After President Jefferson's bellicose message of the previous December,
      war with Spain seemed inevitable. And when Spanish troops crossed the
      Sabine in July and took up their post only seventeen miles from
      Natchitoches, Western Americans awaited only the word to begin
      hostilities. The Orleans Gazette declared that the time to repel Spanish
      aggression had come. The enemy must be driven beyond the Sabine. "The
      route from Natchitoches to Mexico is clear, plain, and open." The occasion
      was at hand "for conferring on our oppressed Spanish brethren in Mexico
      those inestimable blessings of freedom which we ourselves enjoy." "Gallant
      Louisianians! Now is the time to distinguish yourselves .... Should the
      generous efforts of our Government to establish a free, independent
      Republican Empire in Mexico be successful, how fortunate, how enviable
      would be the situation in New Orleans!" The editor who sounded this
      clarion call was a coadjutor of Burr. On the flood tide of a popular war
      against Spain, they proposed to float their own expedition. Much depended
      on General Wilkinson; but he had already written privately of subverting
      the Spanish Government in Mexico, and carrying "our conquests to
      California and the Isthmus of Darien."
    </p>
    <p>
      With much swagger and braggadocio, Wilkinson advanced to the center of the
      stage. He would drive the Spaniards over the Sabine, though they
      outnumbered him three to one. "I believe, my friend," he wrote, "I shall
      be obliged to fight and to flog them." Magnificent stage thunder. But to
      Wilkinson's chagrin the Spaniards withdrew of their own accord. Not a
      Spaniard remained to contest his advance to the border. Yet, oddly enough,
      he remained idle in camp. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some two weeks later, an emissary appeared at Natchitoches with a letter
      from Burr dated the 29th of July, in cipher. What this letter may have
      originally contained will probably never be known, for only Wilkinson's
      version survives, and that underwent frequent revision.* It is quite as
      remarkable for its omissions as for anything that it contains. In it there
      is no mention of a western uprising nor of a revolution in New Orleans;
      but only the intimation that an attack is to be made upon Spanish
      possessions, presumably Mexico, with possibly Baton Rouge as the immediate
      objective. Whether or no this letter changed Wilkinson's plan, we can only
      conjecture. Certain it is, however, that about this time Wilkinson
      determined to denounce Burr and his associates and to play a double game,
      posing on the one hand as the savior of his country and on the other as a
      secret friend to Spain. After some hesitation he wrote to President
      Jefferson warning him in general terms of an expedition preparing against
      Vera Cruz but omitting all mention of Burr. Subsequently he wrote a
      confidential letter about this "deep, dark, and widespread conspiracy"
      which enmeshed all classes and conditions in New Orleans and might bring
      seven thousand men from the Ohio. The contents of Burr's mysterious letter
      were to be communicated orally to the President by the messenger who bore
      this precious warning. It was on the strength of these communications that
      the President issued his proclamation of the 27th of November.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * What is usually accepted as the correct version is printed
     by McCaleb in his "Aaron Burr Conspiracy," pp. 74 and 75,
     and by Henry Adams in his "History of the United States,"
     vol. III, pp. 253-4.
</pre>
    <p>
      While Wilkinson was inditing these misleading missives to the President,
      he was preparing the way for his entry at New Orleans. To the perplexed
      and alarmed Governor he wrote: "You are surrounded by dangers of which you
      dream not, and the destruction of the American Government is seriously
      menaced. The storm will probably burst in New Orleans, where I shall meet
      it, and triumph or perish!" Just five days later he wrote a letter to the
      Viceroy of Mexico which proves him beyond doubt the most contemptible
      rascal who ever wore an American uniform. "A storm, a revolutionary
      tempest, an infernal plot threatens the destruction of the empire," he
      wrote; the first object of attack would be New Orleans, then Vera Cruz,
      then Mexico City; scenes of violence and pillage would follow; let His
      Excellency be on his guard. To ward off these calamities, "I will hurl
      myself like a Leonidas into the breach." But let His Excellency remember
      what risks the writer of this letter incurs, "by offering without orders
      this communication to a foreign power," and let him reimburse the bearer
      of this letter to the amount of 121,000 pesos which will be spent to
      shatter the plans of these bandits from the Ohio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of Wilkinson in New Orleans was awaited by friends and foes,
      with bated breath. The conspirators had as yet no intimation of his
      intentions: Governor Claiborne was torn by suspicion of this would-be
      savior, for at the very time he was reading Wilkinson's gasconade he
      received a cryptic letter from Andrew Jackson which ran, "keep a watchful
      eye on our General and beware of an attack as well from your own country
      as Spain!" If Claiborne could not trust "our General," whom could he
      trust!
    </p>
    <p>
      The stage was now set for the last act in the drama. Wilkinson arrived in
      the city, deliberately set Claiborne aside, and established a species of
      martial law, not without opposition. To justify his course Wilkinson swore
      to an affidavit based on Burr's letter of the 29th of July and proceeded
      with his arbitrary arrests. One by one Burr's confederates were taken into
      custody. The city was kept in a state of alarm; Burr's armed thousands
      were said to be on the way; the negroes were to be incited to revolt. Only
      the actual appearance of Burr's expedition or some extraordinary happening
      could maintain this high pitch of popular excitement and save Wilkinson
      from becoming the ridiculous victim of his own folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 10th of January (1807), after an uneventful voyage down the
      Mississippi, Burr's flotilla reached the mouth of Bayou Pierre, some
      thirty miles above Natchez. Here at length was the huge armada which was
      to shatter the Union&mdash;nine boats and sixty men! Tension began to give
      way. People began to recover their sense of humor. Wilkinson was never in
      greater danger in his life, for he was about to appear ridiculous. It was
      at Bayou Pierre that Burr going ashore learned that Wilkinson had betrayed
      him. His first instinct was to flee, for if he should proceed to New
      Orleans he would fall into Wilkinson's hands and doubtless be
      court-martialed and shot; but if he tarried, he would be arrested and sent
      to Washington. Indecision and despair seized him; and while Blennerhassett
      and other devoted followers waited for their emperor to declare his
      intention, he found himself facing the acting-governor of the Mississippi
      Territory with a warrant for his arrest. To the chagrin of his fellow
      conspirators, Burr surrendered tamely, even pusillanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of the drama was near at hand. Burr was brought before a grand
      jury, and though he once more escaped indictment, he was put under bonds,
      quite illegally he thought, to appear when summoned. On the 1st of
      February he abandoned his followers to the tender mercies of the law and
      fled in disguise into the wilderness. A month later he was arrested near
      the Spanish border above Mobile by Lieutenant Gaines, in command at Fort
      Stoddert, and taken to Richmond. The trial that followed did not prove
      Burr's guilt, but it did prove Thomas Jefferson's credulity and cast grave
      doubts on James Wilkinson's loyalty.* Burr was acquitted of the charge of
      treason in court, but he remained under popular indictment, and his memory
      has never been wholly cleared of the suspicion of treason.

     Marshall and the Constitution" by Edward S. Corwin, in "The

      CHAPTER VII. AN ABUSE OF HOSPITALITY
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Captain Bainbridge was eating his heart out in the Pasha's prison at
      Tripoli, his thoughts reverting constantly to his lost frigate, he
      reminded Commodore Preble, with whom he was allowed to correspond, that
      "the greater part of our crew consists of English subjects not naturalized
      in America." This incidental remark comes with all the force of a
      revelation to those who have fondly imagined that the sturdy jack-tars who
      manned the first frigates were genuine American sea-dogs. Still more
      disconcerting is the information contained in a letter from the Secretary
      of the Treasury to President Jefferson, some years later, to the effect
      that after 1803 American tonnage increased at the rate of seventy thousand
      a year, but that of the four thousand seamen required to man this growing
      mercantile marine, fully one-half were British subjects, presumably
      deserters. How are these uncomfortable facts to be explained? Let a third
      piece of information be added. In a report of Admiral Nelson, dated 1803,
      in which he broaches a plan for manning the British navy, it is soberly
      stated that forty-two thousand British seamen deserted "in the late war."
      Whenever a large convoy assembled at Portsmouth, added the Admiral, not
      less than a thousand seamen usually deserted from the navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slightest acquaintance with the British navy when Nelson was winning
      immortal glory by his victory at Trafalgar must convince the most
      sceptical that his seamen for the most part were little better than galley
      slaves. Life on board these frigates was well-nigh unbearable. The average
      life of a seaman, Nelson reckoned, was forty-five years. In this age
      before processes of refrigeration had been invented, food could not be
      kept edible on long voyages, even in merchantmen. Still worse was the fare
      on men-of-war. The health of a crew was left to Providence. Little or no
      forethought was exercised to prevent disease; the commonest matters of
      personal hygiene were neglected; and when disease came the remedies
      applied were scarcely to be preferred to the disease. Discipline, always
      brutal, was symbolized by the cat-o'-nine-tails. Small wonder that the
      navy was avoided like the plague by every man and seaman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet a navy had to be maintained: it was the cornerstone of the Empire. And
      in all the history of that Empire the need of a navy was never stronger
      than in these opening years of the nineteenth century. The practice of
      impressing able men for the royal navy was as old as the reign of
      Elizabeth. The press gang was an odious institution of long standing&mdash;a
      terror not only to rogue and vagabond but to every able-bodied seafaring
      man and waterman on rivers, who was not exempted by some special act. It
      ransacked the prisons, and carried to the navy not only its victims but
      the germs of fever which infested public places of detention. But the
      press gang harvested its greatest crop of seamen on the seas. Merchantmen
      were stopped at sea, robbed of their able sailors, and left to limp
      short-handed into port. A British East Indiaman homeward bound in 1802 was
      stripped of so many of her crew in the Bay of Biscay that she was unable
      to offer resistance to a French privateer and fell a rich victim into the
      hands of the enemy. The necessity of the royal navy knew no law and often
      defeated its own purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death or desertion offered the only way of escape to the victim of the
      press gang. And the commander of a British frigate dreaded making port
      almost as much as an epidemic of typhus. The deserter always found
      American merchantmen ready to harbor him. Fair wages, relatively
      comfortable quarters, and decent treatment made him quite ready to take
      any measures to forswear his allegiance to Britannia. Naturalization
      papers were easily procured by a few months' residence in any State of the
      Union; and in default of legitimate papers, certificates of citizenship
      could be bought for a song in any American seaport, where shysters drove a
      thrifty traffic in bogus documents. Provided the English navy took the
      precaution to have the description in his certificate tally with his
      personal appearance, and did not let his tongue betray him, he was
      reasonably safe from capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing the palpable fact that British seamen were deserting just when they
      were most needed and were making American merchantmen and frigates their
      asylum, the British naval commanders, with no very nice regard for legal
      distinctions, extended their search for deserters to the decks of American
      vessels, whether in British waters or on the high seas. If in time of war,
      they reasoned, they could stop a neutral ship on the high seas, search her
      for contraband of war, and condemn ship and cargo in a prize court if
      carrying contraband, why might they not by the same token search a vessel
      for British deserters and impress them into service again? Two
      considerations seem to justify this reasoning: the trickiness of the smart
      Yankees who forged citizenship papers, and the indelible character of
      British allegiance. Once an Englishman always an Englishman, by Jove! Your
      hound of a sea-dog might try to talk through his nose like a Yankee, you
      know, and he might shove a dirty bit of paper at you, but he couldn't
      shake off his British citizenship if he wanted to! This was good English
      law, and if it wasn't recognized by other nations so much the worse for
      them. As one of these redoubtable British captains put it, years later:
      "'Might makes right' is the guiding, practical maxim among nations and
      ever will be, so long as powder and shot exist, with money to back them,
      and energy to wield them." Of course, there were hair-splitting fellows,
      plenty of them, in England and the States, who told you that it was one
      thing to seize a vessel carrying contraband and have her condemned by
      judicial process in a court of admiralty, and quite another thing to carry
      British subjects off the decks of a merchantman flying a neutral flag; but
      if you knew the blasted rascals were deserters what difference did it
      make? Besides, what would become of the British navy, if you listened to
      all the fine-spun arguments of landsmen? And if these stalwart blue-water
      Britishers could have read what Thomas Jefferson was writing at this very
      time, they would have classed him with the armchair critics who had no
      proper conception of a sailor's duty. "I hold the right of expatriation,"
      wrote the President, "to be inherent in every man by the laws of nature,
      and incapable of being rightfully taken away from him even by the united
      will of every other person in the nation."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1805, while President Jefferson was still the victim of his
      overmastering passion, and disposed to cultivate the good will of England,
      if thereby he might obtain the Floridas, unforeseen commercial
      complications arose which not only blocked the way to a better
      understanding in Spanish affairs but strained diplomatic relations to the
      breaking point. News reached Atlantic seaports that American merchantmen,
      which had hitherto engaged with impunity in the carrying trade between
      Europe and the West Indies, had been seized and condemned in British
      admiralty courts. Every American shipmaster and owner at once lifted up
      his voice in indignant protest; and all the latent hostility to their old
      enemy revived. Here were new orders-in-council, said they: the leopard
      cannot change his spots. England is still England&mdash;the implacable
      enemy of neutral shipping. "Never will neutrals be perfectly safe till
      free goods make free ships or till England loses two or three great naval
      battles," declared the Salem Register.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recent seizures were not made by orders-in-council, however, but in
      accordance with a decision recently handed down by the court of appeals in
      the case of the ship Essex. Following a practice which had become common
      in recent years, the Essex had sailed with a cargo from Barcelona to Salem
      and thence to Havana. On the high seas she had been captured, and then
      taken to a British port, where ship and cargo were condemned because the
      voyage from Spain to her colony had been virtually continuous, and by the
      so-called Rule of 1756, direct trade between a European state and its
      colony was forbidden to neutrals in time of war when such trade had not
      been permitted in time of peace. Hitherto, the British courts had inclined
      to the view that when goods had been landed in a neutral country and
      duties paid, the voyage had been broken. Tacitly a trade that was
      virtually direct had been countenanced, because the payment of duties
      seemed evidence enough that the cargo became a part of the stock of the
      neutral country and, if reshipped, was then a bona fide neutral cargo.
      Suddenly English merchants and shippers woke to the fact that they were
      often victims of deception. Cargoes would be landed in the United States,
      duties ostensibly paid, and the goods ostensibly imported, only to be
      reshipped in the same bottoms, with the connivance of port officials,
      either without paying any real duties or with drawbacks. In the case of
      the Essex the court of appeals cut directly athwart these practices by
      going behind the prima facie payment and inquiring into the intent of the
      voyage. The mere touching at a port without actually importing the cargo
      into the common stock of the country did not alter the nature of the
      voyage. The crucial point was the intent, which the court was now and
      hereafter determined to ascertain by examination of facts. The court
      reached the indubitable conclusion that the cargo of the Essex had never
      been intended for American markets. The open-minded historian must admit
      that this was a fair application of the Rule of 1756, but he may still
      challenge the validity of the rule, as all neutral countries did, and the
      wisdom of the monopolistic impulse which moved the commercial classes and
      the courts of England to this decision.*

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Professor William E. Lingelbach in a notable article on
     "England and Neutral Trade" in "The Military Historian and
     Economist" (April, 1917) has pointed out the error committed
     by almost every historian from Henry Adams down, that the
     Essex decision reversed previous rulings of the court and
     was not in accord with British law.
</pre>
    <p>
      Had the impressment of seamen and the spoliation of neutral commerce
      occurred only on the high seas, public resentment would have mounted to a
      high pitch in the United States; but when British cruisers ran into
      American waters to capture or burn French vessels, and when British
      men-of-war blockaded ports, detaining and searching&mdash;and at times
      capturing&mdash;American vessels, indignation rose to fever heat. The
      blockade of New York Harbor by two British frigates, the Cambrian and the
      Leander, exasperated merchants beyond measure. On board the Leander was a
      young midshipman, Basil Hall, who in after years described the activities
      of this execrated frigate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every morning at daybreak, we set about arresting the progress of all the
      vessels we saw, firing of guns to the right and left to make every ship
      that was running in heave to, or wait until we had leisure to send a boat
      on board 'to see, in our lingo, 'what she was made of.' I have frequently
      known a dozen, and sometimes a couple of dozen, ships lying a league or
      two off the port, losing their fair wind, their tide, and worse than all
      their market, for many hours, sometimes the whole day, before our search
      was completed."*

    <p>
      One day in April, 1806, the Leander, trying to halt a merchantman that she
      meant to search, fired a shot which killed the helmsman of a passing
      sloop. The boat sailed on to New York with the mangled body; and the
      captain, brother of the murdered man, lashed the populace into a rage by
      his mad words. Supplies for the frigates were intercepted, personal
      violence was threatened to any British officers caught on shore, the
      captain of the Leander was indicted for murder, and the funeral of the
      murdered sailor was turned into a public demonstration. Yet nothing came
      of this incident, beyond a proclamation by the President closing the ports
      of the United States to the offending frigates and ordering the arrest of
      the captain of the Leander wherever found. After all, the death of a
      common seaman did not fire the hearts of farmers peacefully tilling their
      fields far beyond hearing of the Leander's guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year full of troublesome happenings passed; scores of American vessels
      were condemned in British admiralty courts, and American seamen were
      impressed with increasing frequency, until in the early summer of 1807
      these manifold grievances culminated in an outrage that shook even
      Jefferson out of his composure and evoked a passionate outcry for war from
      all parts of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a number of British war vessels were lying in Hampton Roads watching
      for certain French frigates which had taken refuge up Chesapeake Bay, they
      lost a number of seamen by desertion under peculiarly annoying
      circumstances. In one instance a whole boat's crew made off under cover of
      night to Norfolk and there publicly defied their commander. Three
      deserters from the British frigate Melampus had enlisted on the American
      frigate Chesapeake, which had just been fitted out for service in the
      Mediterranean; but on inquiry these three were proven to be native
      Americans who had been impressed into British service. Unfortunately
      inquiry did disclose one British deserter who had enlisted on the
      Chesapeake, a loud-mouthed tar by the name of Jenkin Ratford. These
      irritating facts stirred Admiral Berkeley at Halifax to highhanded
      measures. Without waiting for instructions, he issued an order to all
      commanders in the North Atlantic Squadron to search the Chesapeake for
      deserters, if she should be encountered on the high seas. This order of
      the 1st of June should be shown to the captain of the Chesapeake as
      sufficient authority for searching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On June 22, 1807, the Chesapeake passed unsuspecting between the capes on
      her way to the Mediterranean. She was a stanch frigate carrying forty guns
      and a crew of 375 men and boys; but she was at this time in a distressing
      state of unreadiness, owing to the dilatoriness and incompetence of the
      naval authorities at Washington. The gundeck was littered with lumber and
      odds and ends of rigging; the guns, though loaded, were not all fitted to
      their carriages; and the crew was untrained. As the guns had to be fired
      by slow matches or by loggerheads heated red-hot, and the ammunition was
      stored in the magazine, the frigate was totally unprepared for action.
      Commodore Barron, who commanded the Chesapeake, counted on putting her
      into fighting trim on the long voyage across the Atlantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just ahead of the Chesapeake as she passed out to sea, was the Leopard, a
      British frigate of fifty-two guns, which was apparently on the lookout for
      suspicious merchantmen. It was not until both vessels were eight miles or
      more southeast of Cape Henry that the movements of the Leopard began to
      attract attention. At about half-past three in the afternoon she came
      within hailing distance and hove to, announcing that she had dispatches
      for the commander. The Chesapeake also hove to and answered the hail, a
      risky move considering that she was unprepared for action and that the
      Leopard lay to the windward. But why should the commander of the American
      frigate have entertained suspicions?
    </p>
    <p>
      A boat put out from the Leopard, bearing a petty officer, who delivered a
      note enclosing Admiral Berkeley's order and expressing the hope that
      "every circumstance... may be adjusted in a manner that the harmony
      subsisting between the two countries may remain undisturbed." Commodore
      Barron replied that he knew of no British deserters on his vessel and
      declined in courteous terms to permit his crew to be mustered by any other
      officers but their own. The messenger departed, and then, for the first
      time entertaining serious misgivings, Commodore Barron ordered his decks
      cleared for action. But before the crew could bestir themselves, the
      Leopard drew near, her men at quarters. The British commander shouted a
      warning, but Barron, now thoroughly alarmed, replied, "I don't hear what
      you say." The warning was repeated, but again Barron to gain time shouted
      that he could not hear. The Leopard then fired two shots across the bow of
      the Chesapeake, and almost immediately without parleying further&mdash;she
      was now within two hundred feet of her victim&mdash;poured a broadside
      into the American vessel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confusion reigned on the Chesapeake. The crew for the most part showed
      courage, but they were helpless, for they could not fire a gun for want of
      slow matches or loggerheads. They crowded about the magazine clamoring in
      vain for a chance to defend the vessel; they yelled with rage at their
      predicament. Only one gun was discharged and that was by means of a live
      coal brought up from the galley after the Chesapeake had received a third
      broadside and Commodore Barron had ordered the flag to be hauled down to
      spare further slaughter. Three of his crew had already been killed and
      eighteen wounded, himself among the number. The whole action lasted only
      fifteen minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boarding crews now approached and several British officers climbed to the
      deck of the Chesapeake and mustered her crew. Among the ship's company
      they found the alleged deserters and, hiding in the coal-hole, the
      notorious Jenkin Ratford. These four men they took with them, and the
      Leopard, having fulfilled her instructions, now suffered the Chesapeake to
      limp back to Hampton Roads. "For the first time in their history," writes
      Henry Adams, * "the people of the United States learned, in June, 1807,
      the feeling of a true national emotion. Hitherto every public passion had
      been more or less partial and one-sided;... but the outrage committed on
      the Chesapeake stung through hidebound prejudices, and made democrat and
      aristocrat writhe alike."

      Had President Jefferson chosen to go to war at this moment, he would have
      had a united people behind him, and he was well aware that he possessed
      the power of choice. "The affair of the Chesapeake put war into my hand,"
      he wrote some years later. "I had only to open it and let havoc loose."
      But Thomas Jefferson was not a martial character. The State Governors, to
      be sure, were requested to have their militia in readiness, and the
      Governor of Virginia was desired to call such companies into service as
      were needed for the defense of Norfolk. The President referred in
      indignant terms to the abuse of the laws of hospitality and the "outrage"
      committed by the British commander; but his proclamation only ordered all
      British armed vessels out of American waters and forbade all intercourse
      with them if they remained. The tone of the proclamation was so moderate
      as to seem pusillanimous. John Randolph called it an apology. Thomas
      Jefferson did not mean to have war. With that extraordinary confidence in
      his own powers, which in smaller men would be called smug conceit, he
      believed that he could secure disavowal and honorable reparation for the
      wrong committed; but he chose a frail intermediary when he committed this
      delicate mission to James Monroe.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII. THE PACIFISTS OF 1807
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is one of the strange paradoxes of our time that the author of the
      Declaration of Independence, to whose principle of self-determination the
      world seems again to be turning, should now be regarded as a
      self-confessed pacifist, with all the derogatory implications that lurk in
      that epithet. The circumstances which made him a revolutionist in 1776 and
      a passionate advocate of peace in 1807 deserve some consideration. The
      charge made by contemporaries of Jefferson that his aversion to war sprang
      from personal cowardice may be dismissed at once, as it was by him, with
      contempt. Nor was his hatred of war merely an instinctive abhorrence of
      bloodshed. He had not hesitated to wage naval war on the Barbary Corsairs.
      It is true that he was temperamentally averse to the use of force under
      ordinary circumstances. He did not belong to that type of full-blooded men
      who find self-expression in adventurous activity. Mere physical effort
      without conscious purpose never appealed to him. He was at the opposite
      pole of life from a man like Aaron Burr. He never, so far as history
      records, had an affair of honor; he never fought a duel; he never
      performed active military service; he never took human life. Yet he was
      not a non-resistant. "My hope of preserving peace for our country," he
      wrote on one occasion, "is not founded in the Quaker principle of
      nonresistance under every wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      The true sources of Jefferson's pacifism must be sought in his
      rationalistic philosophy, which accorded the widest scope to the principle
      of self-direction and self determination, whether on the part of the
      individual or of groups of individuals. To impose one's will upon another
      was to enslave, according to his notion; to coerce by war was to enslave a
      community; and to enslave a community was to provoke revolution.
      Jefferson's thought gravitated inevitably to the center of his rational
      universe&mdash;to the principle of enlightened self-interest. Men and
      women are not to be permanently moved by force but by appeals to their
      interests. He completed his thought as follows in the letter already
      quoted: "But [my hope of preserving peace is founded] in the belief that a
      just and friendly conduct on our part will procure justice and friendship
      from others. In the existing contest, each of the combatants will find an
      interest in our friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a chaotic world in which this philosopher-statesman was called upon
      to act&mdash;a world in which international law and neutral rights had
      been well-nigh submerged in twelve years of almost continuous war. Yet
      with amazing self-assurance President Jefferson believed that he held in
      his hand a master-key which would unlock all doors that had been shut to
      the commerce of neutrals. He called this master-key "peaceable coercion,"
      and he explained its magic potency in this wise:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our commerce is so valuable to them [the European belligerents] that they
      will be glad to purchase it when the only price we ask is to do us
      justice. I believe that we have in our hands the means of peaceable
      coercion; and that the moment they see our government so united as that
      they can make use of it, they will for their own interest be disposed to
      do us justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of using commercial restrictions as a weapon to secure
      recognition of rights was of course not original with Jefferson, but it
      was now to be given a trial without parallel in the history of the nation.
      Non-importation agreements had proved efficacious in the struggle of the
      colonies with the mother country; it seemed not unreasonable to suppose
      that a well-sustained refusal to traffic in English goods would meet the
      emergency of 1807, when the ruling of British admiralty courts threatened
      to cut off the lucrative commerce between Europe and the West Indies. With
      this theory in view, the President and his Secretary of State advocated
      the NonImportation Bill of April 18, 1806, which forbade the entry of
      certain specified goods of British manufacture. The opposition found a
      leader in Randolph, who now broke once and for all with the
      Administration. "Never in the course of my life," he exclaimed, "have I
      witnessed such a scene of indignity and inefficiency as this measure holds
      forth to the world. What is it? A milk-and-water bill! A dose of
      chicken-broth to be taken nine months hence!... It is too contemptible to
      be the object of consideration, or to excite the feelings of the pettiest
      state in Europe." The Administration carried the bill through Congress,
      but Randolph had the satisfaction of seeing his characterisation of the
      measure amply justified by the course of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the Non-Importation Act as a weapon, the President was confident that
      Monroe, who had once more returned to his post in London, could force a
      settlement of all outstanding differences with Great Britain. To his
      annoyance, and to Monroe's chagrin, however, he was obliged to send a
      special envoy to act with Monroe. Factious opposition in the Senate forced
      the President to placate the Federalists by appointing William Pinkney of
      Maryland. The American commissioners were instructed to insist upon three
      concessions in the treaty which they were to negotiate: restoration of
      trade with enemies' colonies, indemnity for captures made since the Essex
      decision, and express repudiation of the right of impressment. In return
      for these concessions, they might hold out the possible repeal of the
      Non-Importation Act! Only confirmed optimists could believe that the
      mistress of the seas, flushed with the victory of Trafalgar, would consent
      to yield these points for so slight a compensation. The mission was,
      indeed, doomed from the outset, and nothing more need be said of it than
      that in the end, to secure any treaty at all, Monroe and Pinkney broke
      their instructions and set aside the three ultimata. What they obtained in
      return seemed so insignificant and doubtful, and what they paid for even
      these slender compensations seemed so exorbitant, that the President would
      not even submit the treaty to the Senate. The first application of the
      theory of peaceable coercion thus ended in humiliating failure. Jefferson
      thought it best "to let the negotiation take a friendly nap"; but Madison,
      who felt that his political future depended on a diplomatic triumph over
      England, drafted new instructions for the two commissioners, hoping that
      the treaty might yet be put into acceptable form. It was while these new
      instructions were crossing the ocean that the Chesapeake struck her
      colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Monroe is one of the most unlucky diplomats in American history.
      From those early days when he had received the fraternal embraces of the
      Jacobins in Paris and had been recalled by President Washington, to the
      ill-fated Spanish mission, circumstances seem to have conspired against
      him. The honor of negotiating the purchase of Louisiana should have been
      his alone, but he arrived just a day too late and was obliged to divide
      the glory with Livingston. On this mission to England he was not permitted
      to conduct negotiations alone but was associated with William Pinkney, a
      Federalist. No wonder he suspected Madison, or at least Madison's friends,
      of wishing to discredit him. And now another impossible task was laid upon
      him. He was instructed to demand not only disavowal and reparation for the
      attack on the Chesapeake and the restoration of the American seamen, but
      also as "an indispensable part of the satisfaction" "an entire abolition
      of impressments." If the Secretary of State had deliberately contrived to
      deliver Monroe into the hands of George Canning, he could not have been
      more successful, for Monroe had already protested against the Chesapeake
      outrage as an act of aggression which should be promptly disavowed without
      reference to the larger question of impressment. He was now obliged to eat
      his own words and inject into the discussion, as Canning put it, the
      irrelevant matters which they had agreed to separate from the present
      controversy. Canning was quick to see his opportunity. Mr. Monroe must be
      aware, said he, that on several recent occasions His Majesty had firmly
      declined to waive "the ancient and prescriptive usages of Great Britain,
      founded on the soundest principles of natural law," simply because they
      might come in contact with the interests or the feelings of the American
      people. If Mr. Monroe's instructions left him powerless to adjust this
      regrettable incident of the Leopard and the Chesapeake, without raising
      the other question of the right of search and impressment, then His
      Majesty could only send a special envoy to the United States to terminate
      the controversy in a manner satisfactory to both countries. "But," added
      Canning with sarcasm which was not lost on Monroe, "in order to avoid the
      inconvenience which has arisen from the mixed nature of your instructions,
      that minister will not be empowered to entertain... any proposition
      respecting the search of merchant vessels."
    </p>
    <p>
      One more humiliating experience was reserved for Monroe before his
      diplomatic career closed. Following Madison's new set of instructions, he
      and Pinkney attempted to reopen negotiations for the revision of the
      discredited treaty of the preceding year. But Canning had reasons of his
      own for wishing to be rid of a treaty which had been drawn by the late
      Whig Ministry. He informed the American commissioners arrogantly that "the
      proposal of the President of the United States for proceeding to negotiate
      anew upon the basis of a treaty already solemnly concluded and signed, is
      a proposal wholly inadmissible." His Majesty could therefore only
      acquiesce in the refusal of the President to ratify the treaty. One week
      later, James Monroe departed from London, never again to set foot on
      British soil, leaving Pinkney to assume the duties of Minister at the
      Court of St. James. For the second time Monroe returned to his own country
      discredited by the President who had appointed him. In both instances he
      felt himself the victim of injustice. In spite of his friendship for
      Jefferson, he was embittered against the Administration and in this mood
      lent himself all too readily to the schemes of John Randolph, who had
      already picked him as the one candidate who could beat Madison in the next
      presidential election.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the point of view of George Canning and the Tory squirearchy whose
      mouthpiece he was, the Chesapeake affair was but an incident&mdash;an
      unhappy incident, to be sure, but still only an incident&mdash;in the
      world-wide struggle with Napoleon. What was at stake was nothing less than
      the commercial supremacy of Great Britain. The astounding growth of
      Napoleon's empire was a standing menace to British trade. The overthrow of
      Prussia in the fall of 1806 left the Corsican in control of Central Europe
      and in a position to deal his long premeditated blow. A fortnight after
      the battle of Jena, he entered Berlin and there issued the famous decree
      which was his answer to the British blockade of the French channel ports.
      Since England does not recognize the system of international law
      universally observed by all civilized nations&mdash;so the preamble read&mdash;but
      by a monstrous abuse of the right of blockade has determined to destroy
      neutral trade and to raise her commerce and industry upon the ruins of
      that of the continent, and since "whoever deals on the continent in
      English goods thereby favors and renders himself an accomplice of her
      designs," therefore the British Isles are declared to be in a state of
      blockade. Henceforth all English goods were to be lawful prize in any
      territory held by the troops of France or her allies; and all vessels
      which had come from English ports or from English colonies were to be
      confiscated, together with their cargoes. This challenge was too much for
      the moral equilibrium of the squires, the shipowners, and the merchants
      who dominated Parliament. It dulled their sense of justice and made them
      impatient under the pinpricks which came from the United States. "A few
      short months of war," declared the Morning Post truculently, "would
      convince these desperate [American] politicians of the folly of measuring
      the strength of a rising, but still infant and puny, nation with the
      colossal power of the British Empire." "Right," said the Times, another
      organ of the Tory Government, "is power sanctioned by usage." Concession
      to Americans at this crisis was not to be entertained for a moment, for
      after all, said the Times, they "possess all the vices of their Indian
      neighbors without their virtues."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this temper the British Government was prepared to ignore the United
      States and deal Napoleon blow for blow. An order-in-council of January 7,
      1807, asserted the right of retaliation and declared that "no vessel shall
      be permitted to trade from one port to another, both which ports shall
      belong to, or be in possession of France or her allies." The peculiar
      hardship of this order for American shipowners is revealed by the papers
      of Stephen Girard of Philadelphia, whose shrewdness and enterprise were
      making him one of the merchant princes of his time. One of his ships, the
      Liberty, of some 250 tons, was sent to Lisbon with a cargo of 2052 barrels
      and 220 half-barrels of flour which cost the owner $10.68 a barrel. Her
      captain, on entering port, learned that flour commanded a better price at
      Cadiz. To Cadiz, accordingly, he set sail and sold his cargo for $22.50 a
      barrel, winning for the owner a goodly profit of $25,000, less commission.
      It was such trading ventures as this that the British order-in-council
      doomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What American shipmasters had now to fear from both belligerents was made
      startlingly clear by the fate of the ship Horizon, which had sailed from
      Charleston, South Carolina, with a cargo for Zanzibar. On the way she
      touched at various South American ports and disposed of most of her cargo.
      Then changing her destination, and taking on a cargo for the English
      market, she set sail for London. On the way she was forced to put in at
      Lisbon to refit. As she left to resume her voyage she was seized by an
      English frigate and brought in as a fair prize, since&mdash;according to
      the Rule of 1756&mdash;she had been apprehended in an illegal traffic
      between an enemy country and its colony. The British prize court condemned
      the cargo but released the ship. The unlucky Horizon then loaded with an
      English cargo and sailed again to Lisbon, but misfortune overtook her and
      she was wrecked off the French coast. Her cargo was salvaged, however, and
      what was not of English origin was restored to her owners by decree of a
      French prize court; the rest of her cargo was confiscated under the terms
      of the Berlin decree. When the American Minister protested at this
      decision, he was told that "since America suffers her ships to be
      searched, she adopts the principle that the flag does not cover the goods.
      Since she recognizes the absurd blockades laid by England, consents to
      having her vessels incessantly stopped, sent to England, and so turned
      aside from their course, why should the Americans not suffer the blockade
      laid by France? Certainly France recognizes that these measures are
      unjust, illegal, and subversive of national sovereignty; but it is the
      duty of nations to resort to force, and to declare themselves against
      things which dishonor them and disgrace their independence." * But an
      invitation to enter the European maelstrom and battle for neutral rights
      made no impression upon the mild-tempered President.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Henry Adams, History of the United States, IV, p. 110.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is as clear as day that the British Government was now determined,
      under pretense of retaliating upon France, to promote British trade with
      the continent by every means and at the expense of neutrals. Another
      order-in-council, November 17, 1807, closed to neutrals all European ports
      under French control, "as if the same were actually blockaded," but
      permitted vessels which first entered a British port and obtained a
      British license to sail to any continental port. It was an order which, as
      Henry Adams has said, could have but one purpose&mdash;to make American
      commerce English. This was precisely the contemporary opinion of the
      historian's grandfather, who declared that the "orders-in-council, if
      submitted to, would have degraded us to the condition of colonists."
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one more blow was needed, it would seem, to complete the ruin of
      American commerce. It fell a month later, when Napoleon, having overrun
      the Spanish peninsula and occupied Portugal, issued his Milan decree of
      December 17, 1807. Henceforth any vessel which submitted to search by
      English cruisers, or paid any tonnage duty or tax to the English
      Government, or sailed to or from any English port, would be captured and
      condemned as lawful prize. Such was to be the maritime code of France
      "until England should return to the principles of international law which
      are also those of justice and honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was a commercial nation less prepared to defend itself against
      depredations than the United States of America in this year 1807. For this
      unpreparedness many must bear the blame, but President Jefferson has
      become the scapegoat. This Virginia farmer and landsman was not only
      ignorant and distrustful of all the implements of war, but utterly
      unfamiliar with the ways of the sea and with the first principles of
      sea-power. The Tripolitan War seems to have inspired him with a single
      fixed idea&mdash;that for defensive purposes gunboats were superior to
      frigates and less costly. He set forth this idea in a special message to
      Congress (February 10, 1807), claiming to have the support of
      "professional men," among whom he mentioned Generals Wilkinson and Gates!
      He proposed the construction of two hundred of these gunboats, which would
      be distributed among the various exposed harbors, where in time of peace
      they would be hauled up on shore under sheds, for protection against sun
      and storm. As emergency arose these floating batteries were to be manned
      by the seamen and militia of the port. What appealed particularly to the
      President in this programme was the immunity it offered from "an
      excitement to engage in offensive maritime war." Gallatin would have
      modified even this plan for economy's sake. He would have constructed only
      one-half of the proposed fleet since the large seaports could probably
      build thirty gunboats in as many days, if an emergency arose. In
      extenuation of Gallatin's shortsightedness, it should be remembered that
      he was a native of Switzerland, whose navy has never ploughed many seas.
      It is less easy to excuse the rest of the President's advisers and the
      Congress which was beguiled into accepting this naive project. Nor did the
      Chesapeake outrage teach either Congress or the Administration a salutary
      lesson. On the contrary, when in October the news of the bombardment of
      Copenhagen had shattered the nerves of statesmen in all neutral countries,
      and while the differences with England were still unsettled, Jefferson and
      his colleagues decided to hold four of the best frigates in port and use
      them "as receptacles for enlisting seamen to fill the gunboats
      occasionally." Whom the gods would punish they first make mad!
    </p>
    <p>
      The 17th of December was a memorable day in the annals of this
      Administration. Favorable tradewinds had brought into American ports a
      number of packets with news from Europe. The Revenge had arrived in New
      York with Armstrong's dispatches announcing Napoleon's purpose to enforce
      the Berlin decree; the Edward had reached Boston with British newspapers
      forecasting the order-in-council of the 11th of November. This news burst
      like a bomb in Washington where the genial President was observing with
      scientific detachment the operation of his policy of commercial coercion.
      The Non-Importation Act had just gone into effect. Jefferson immediately
      called his Cabinet together. All were of one mind. The impending
      order-in-council, it was agreed, left but one alternative. Commerce must
      be totally suspended until the full scope of these new aggressions could
      be ascertained. The President took a loose sheet of paper and drafted
      hastily a message to Congress, recommending an embargo in anticipation of
      the offensive British order. But the prudent Madison urged that it was
      better not to refer explicitly to the order and proposed a substitute
      which simply recommended "an immediate inhibition of the departure of our
      vessels from the ports of the United States," on the ground that shipping
      was likely to be exposed to greater dangers. Only Gallatin demurred: he
      would have preferred an embargo for a limited time. "I prefer war to a
      permanent embargo," he wrote next day. "Government prohibitions," he added
      significantly, "do always more mischief than had been calculated." But
      Gallatin was overruled and the message, in Madison's form, was sent to
      Congress on the following day. The Senate immediately passed the desired
      bill through three readings in a single day; the House confirmed this
      action after only two days of debate; and on the 22d of December, the
      President signed the Embargo Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was this measure which was passed by Congress almost without
      discussion? Ostensibly it was an act for the protection of American ships,
      merchandise, and seamen. It forbade the departure of all ships for foreign
      ports, except vessels under the immediate direction of the President and
      vessels in ballast or already loaded with goods. Foreign armed vessels
      were exempted also as a matter of course. Coasting ships were to give
      bonds double the value of vessel and cargo to reland their freight in some
      port of the United States. Historians have discovered a degree of
      duplicity in the alleged motives for this act. How, it is asked, could
      protection of ships and seamen be the motive when all of Jefferson's
      private letters disclose his determination to put his theory of peaceable
      coercion to a practical test by this measure? The criticism is not
      altogether fair, for, as Jefferson would himself have replied, peaceable
      coercion was designed to force the withdrawal of orders-in-council and
      decrees that menaced the safety of ships and cargoes. The policy might
      entail some incidental hardships, to be sure, but the end in view was
      protection of American lives and property. Madison was not quite candid,
      nevertheless, when he assured the British Minister that the embargo was a
      precautionary measure only and not conceived with hostile intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chimerical this policy seemed to many contemporaries; chimerical it has
      seemed to historians, and to us who have passed through the World War. Yet
      in the World War it was the possession of food stuffs and raw materials by
      the United States which gave her a dominating position in the councils of
      the Allies. Had her commerce in 1807 been as necessary to England and
      France as it was "at the very peak" of the World War, Thomas Jefferson
      might have proved that peaceable coercion is an effective alternative to
      war; but he overestimated the magnitude and importance of the carrying
      trade of the United States, and erred still more grievously in assuming
      that a public conscience existed which would prove superior to the
      temptation to evade the law. Jefferson dreaded war quite as much because
      of its concomitants as because of its inevitable brutality, quite as much
      because it tended to exalt government and to produce corruption as because
      it maimed bodies and sacrificed human lives. Yet he never took fully into
      account the possible accompaniments of his alternative to war. That the
      embargo would debauch public morals and make government arbitrary, he was
      to learn only by bitter experience and personal humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just after the passage of this momentous act, Canning's special envoy,
      George Rose, arrived in the United States. A British diplomat of the
      better sort, with much dignity of manner and suave courtesy, he was
      received with more than ordinary consideration by the Administration. He
      was commissioned, every one supposed, to offer reparation for the
      Chesapeake affair. Even after he had notified Madison that his
      instructions bade him insist, as an indispensable preliminary, on the
      recall of the President's Chesapeake proclamation, he was treated with
      deference and assured that the President was prepared to comply, if he
      could do so without incurring the charge of inconsistency and disregard of
      national honor. Madison proposed to put a proclamation of recall in Rose's
      hands, duly signed by the President and dated so as to correspond with the
      day on which all differences should be adjusted. Rose consented to this
      course and the proclamation was delivered into his hands. He then divulged
      little by little his further instructions, which were such as no
      self-respecting administration could listen to with composure. Canning
      demanded a formal disavowal of Commodore Barron's conduct in encouraging
      deserters from His Majesty's service and harboring them on board his ship.
      "You will state," read Rose's instructions, "that such disavowals,
      solemnly expressed, would afford to His Majesty a satisfactory pledge on
      the part of the American Government that the recurrence of similar causes
      will not on any occasion impose on His Majesty the necessity of
      authorizing those means of force to which Admiral Berkeley has resorted
      without authority, but which the continued repetition of such provocations
      as unfortunately led to the attack upon the Chesapeake might render
      necessary, as a just reprisal on the part of His Majesty." No doubt Rose
      did his best to soften the tone of these instructions, but he could not
      fail to make them clear; and Madison, who had conducted these informal
      interviews, slowly awoke to the real nature of what he was asked to do. He
      closed further negotiations with the comment that the United States could
      not be expected "to make, as it were, an expiatory sacrifice to obtain
      redress, or beg for reparation." The Administration determined to let the
      disavowal of Berkeley suffice for the present and to allow the matter of
      reparation to await further developments. The coercive policy on which the
      Administration had now launched would, it was confidently believed, bring
      His Majesty's Government to terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very suggestion of an embargo had an unexpected effect upon American
      shipmasters. To avoid being shut up in port, fleets of ships put out to
      sea half-manned, half-laden, and often without clearance papers. With
      freight rates soaring to unheard-of altitudes, ship-owners were willing to
      assume all the risks of the sea&mdash;British frigates included. So little
      did they appreciate the protection offered by a benevolent government that
      they assumed an attitude of hostility to authority and evaded the
      exactions of the law in every conceivable way. Under guise of engaging in
      the coasting trade, many a ship landed her cargo in a foreign port; a
      brisk traffic also sprang up across the Canadian border; and Amelia Island
      in St. Mary's River, Florida, became a notorious mart for illicit
      commerce. Almost at once Congress was forced to pass supplementary acts,
      conferring upon collectors of ports powers of inspection and regulation
      which Gallatin unhesitatingly pronounced both odious and dangerous. The
      President affixed his signature ruefully to acts which increased the army,
      multiplied the number of gunboats under construction, and appropriated a
      million and a quarter dollars to the construction of coast defenses and
      the equipment of militia. "This embargo act," he confessed, "is certainly
      the most embarrassing we ever had to execute. I did not expect a crop of
      so sudden and rank growth of fraud and open opposition by force could have
      grown up in the United States."
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst feature of the experiment was its ineffectiveness. The
      inhibition of commerce had so slight an effect upon England that when
      Pinkney approached Canning with the proposal of a quid pro quo&mdash;the
      United States to rescind the embargo, England to revoke her
      orders-in-council&mdash;he was told with biting sarcasm that "if it were
      possible to make any sacrifice for the repeal of the embargo without
      appearing to deprecate it as a measure of hostility, he would gladly have
      facilitated its removal AS A MEASURE OF INCONVENIENT RESTRICTION UPON THE
      AMERICAN PEOPLE." By licensing American vessels, indeed, which had either
      slipped out of port before the embargo or evaded the collectors, the
      British Government was even profiting by this measure of restriction. It
      was these vagrant vessels which gave Napoleon his excuse for the Bayonne
      decree of April 17, 1808, when with a stroke of the pen he ordered the
      seizure of all American ships in French ports and swept property to the
      value of ten million dollars into the imperial exchequer. Since these
      vessels were abroad in violation of the embargo, he argued, they could not
      be American craft but must be British ships in disguise. General
      Armstrong, writing from Paris, warned the Secretary of State not to expect
      that the embargo would do more than keep the United States at peace with
      the belligerents. As a coercive measure, its effect was nil. "Here it is
      not felt, and in England... it is forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the end of the year the failure of the embargo was patent to every
      fair-minded observer. Men might differ ever so much as to the harm wrought
      by the embargo abroad; but all agreed that it was not bringing either
      France or England to terms, and that it was working real hardship at home.
      Federalists in New England, where nearly one-third of the ships in the
      carrying trade were owned, pointed to the schooners "rotting at their
      wharves," to the empty shipyards and warehouses, to the idle sailors
      wandering in the streets of port towns, and asked passionately how long
      they must be sacrificed to the theories of this charlatan in the White
      House. Even Southern Republicans were asking uneasily when the President
      would realize that the embargo was ruining planters who could not market
      their cotton and tobacco. And Republicans whose pockets were not touched
      were soberly questioning whether a policy that reduced the annual value of
      exports from $108,000,000 to $22,000,000, and cut the national revenue in
      half, had not been tested long enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indications multiplied that "the dictatorship of Mr. Jefferson" was
      drawing to a close. In 1808, after the election of Madison as his
      successor, he practically abdicated as leader of his party, partly out of
      an honest conviction that he ought not to commit the President-elect by
      any positive course of action, and partly no doubt out of a less
      praiseworthy desire not to admit the defeat of his cherished principle.
      His abdication left the party without resolute leadership at a critical
      moment. Madison and Gallatin tried to persuade their party associates to
      continue the embargo until June, and then, if concessions were not
      forthcoming, to declare war; but they were powerless to hold the
      Republican majority together on this programme. Setting aside the embargo
      and returning to the earlier policy of non-intercourse, Congress adopted a
      measure which excluded all English and French vessels and imports, but
      which authorized the President to renew trade with either country if it
      should mend its ways. On March 1, 1809, with much bitterness of spirit,
      Thomas Jefferson signed the bill which ended his great experiment. Martha
      Jefferson once said of her father that he never gave up a friend or an
      opinion. A few months before his death, he alluded to the embargo, with
      the pathetic insistence of old age, as "a measure, which, persevered in a
      little longer... would have effected its object completely."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX. THE LAST PHASE OF PEACEABLE COERCION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days after Jefferson gave his consent to the repeal of the embargo,
      the Presidency passed in succession to the second of the Virginia Dynasty.
      It was not an impressive figure that stood beside Jefferson and faced the
      great crowd gathered in the new Hall of Representatives at the Capitol.
      James Madison was a pale, extremely nervous, and obviously unhappy person
      on this occasion. For a masterful character this would have been the day
      of days; for Madison it was a fearful ordeal which sapped every ounce of
      energy. He trembled violently as he began to speak and his voice was
      almost inaudible. Those who could not hear him but who afterward read the
      Inaugural Address doubtless comforted themselves with the reflection that
      they had not missed much. The new President, indeed, had nothing new to
      say&mdash;no new policy to advocate. He could only repeat the old
      platitudes about preferring "amicable discussion and reasonable
      accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an appeal to arms."
      Evidently, no strong assertion of national rights was to be expected from
      this plain, homespun President.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Inaugural Ball, however, people forgot their President in
      admiration of the President's wife, Dolly Madison. "She looked a queen,"
      wrote Mrs. Margaret Bayard Smith. "She had on a pale buff-colored velvet,
      made plain, with a very long train, but not the least trimming, and
      beautiful pearl necklace, earrings, and bracelets. Her head dress was a
      turban of the same colored velvet and white satin (from Paris) with two
      superb plumes, the bird of paradise feathers. It would be ABSOLUTELY
      IMPOSSIBLE for any one to behave with more perfect propriety than she did.
      Unassuming dignity, sweetness, grace. Mr. Madison, on the contrary,"
      continued this same warm-hearted observer, "seemed spiritless and
      exhausted. While he was standing by me, I said, 'I wish with all my heart
      I had a little bit of seat to offer you.' 'I wish so too,' said he, with a
      most woebegone face, and looking as if he could hardly stand. The managers
      came up to ask him to stay to supper, he assented, and turning to me, 'but
      I would much rather be in bed,' he said." Quite different was Mr.
      Jefferson on this occasion. He seemed to be in high spirits and "his
      countenance beamed with a benevolent joy." It seemed to this ardent
      admirer that "every demonstration of respect to Mr. M. gave Mr. J. more
      pleasure than if paid to himself." No wonder that Mr. Jefferson was in
      good spirits. Was he not now free from all the anxieties and worries of
      politics? Already he was counting on retiring "to the elysium of domestic
      affections and the irresponsible direction" of his own affairs. A week
      later he set out for Monticello on horseback, never again to set foot in
      the city which had witnessed his triumph and his humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The election of Madison had disclosed wide rifts in his party. Monroe had
      lent himself to the designs of John Randolph and had entered the list of
      candidates for the Presidency; and Vice-President Clinton had also been
      put forward by other malcontents. It was this division in the ranks of the
      opposition which in the end had insured Madison's election; but factional
      differences pursued Madison into the White House. Even in the choice of
      his official family he was forced to consider the preferences of
      politicians whom he despised, for when he would have appointed Gallatin
      Secretary of State, he found Giles of Virginia and Samuel Smith of
      Maryland bent upon defeating the nomination. The Smith faction was,
      indeed, too influential to be ignored; with a wry face Madison stooped to
      a bargain which left Gallatin at the head of the Treasury but which
      saddled his Administration with Robert Smith, who proved to be quite
      unequal to the exacting duties of the Department of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Administration began with what appeared to be a great diplomatic
      triumph. In April the President issued a proclamation announcing that the
      British orders-in-council would be withdrawn on the 10th of June, after
      which date commerce with Great Britain might be renewed. In the newspapers
      appeared, with this welcome proclamation, a note drafted by the British
      Minister Erskine expressing the confident hope that all differences
      between the two countries would be adjusted by a special envoy whom His
      Majesty had determined to send to the United States. The Republican press
      was jubilant. At last the sage of Monticello was vindicated. "It may be
      boldly alleged," said the National Intelligencer, "that the revocation of
      the British orders is attributable to the embargo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgotten now were all the grievances against Great Britain. Every
      shipping port awoke to new life. Merchants hastened to consign the
      merchandise long stored in their warehouses; shipmasters sent out runners
      for crews; and ships were soon winging their way out into the open sea.
      For three months American vessels crossed the ocean unmolested, and then
      came the bitter, the incomprehensible news that Erskine's arrangement had
      been repudiated and the over-zealous diplomat recalled. The one brief
      moment of triumph in Madison's administration had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and painfully the public learned the truth. Erskine had exceeded
      his instructions. Canning had not been averse to concessions, it is true,
      but he had named as an indispensable condition of any concession that the
      United States should bind itself to exclude French ships of war from its
      ports. Instead of holding to the letter of his instructions, Erskine had
      allowed himself to be governed by the spirit of concession and had ignored
      the essential prerequisite. Nothing remained but to renew the
      NonIntercourse Act against Great Britain. This the President did by
      proclamation on August 9, 1809, and the country settled back sullenly into
      commercial inactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another scarcely less futile chapter in diplomacy began with the arrival
      of Francis James Jackson as British Minister in September. Those who knew
      this Briton were justified in concluding that conciliation had no
      important place in the programme of the Foreign Office, for it was he who,
      two years before, had conducted those negotiations with Denmark which
      culminated in the bombardment and destruction of Copenhagen. "It is rather
      a prevailing notion here," wrote Pinkney from London, "that this
      gentleman's conduct will not and cannot be what we all wish." And this
      impression was so fully shared by Madison that he would not hasten his
      departure from Montpelier but left Jackson to his own devices at the
      capital for a full month.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interval of enforced inactivity had one unhappy consequence. Not
      finding employment for all his idle hours, Jackson set himself to read the
      correspondence of his predecessor, and from it he drew the conclusion that
      Erskine was a greater fool than he had thought possible, and that the
      American Government had been allowed to use language of which "every third
      word was a declaration of war." The further he read the greater his ire,
      so that when the President arrived in Washington (October 1), Jackson was
      fully resolved to let the American Government know what was due to a
      British Minister who had had audiences "with most of the sovereigns of
      Europe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Though neither the President nor Gallatin, to whose mature judgment he
      constantly turned, believed that Jackson had any proposals to make, they
      were willing to let Robert Smith carry on informal conversations with him.
      It speedily appeared that so far from making overtures, Jackson was
      disposed to await proposals. The President then instructed the Secretary
      of State to announce that further discussions would be "in the written
      form" and henceforth himself took direct charge of negotiations. The
      exchange of letters which followed reveals Madison at his best. His
      rapier-like thrusts soon pierced even the thick hide of this conceited
      Englishman. The stupid Smith who signed these letters appeared to be no
      mean adversary after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of his rejoinders the British Minister yielded to a flash of temper
      and insinuated (as Canning in his instructions had done) that the American
      Government had known Erskine's instructions and had encouraged him to set
      them aside&mdash;had connived in short at his wrongdoing. "Such
      insinuations," replied Madison sharply, "are inadmissible in the
      intercourse of a foreign minister with a government that understands what
      it owes itself." "You will find that in my correspondence with you," wrote
      Jackson angrily, "I have carefully avoided drawing conclusions that did
      not necessarily follow from the premises advanced by me, and least of all
      should I think of uttering an insinuation where I was unable to
      substantiate a fact." A fatal outburst of temper which delivered the
      writer into the hands of his adversary. "Sir," wrote the President, still
      using the pen of his docile secretary, "finding that you have used a
      language which cannot be understood but as reiterating and even
      aggravating the same gross insinuation, it only remains, in order to
      preclude opportunities which are thus abused, to inform you that no
      further communications will be received from you." Therewith terminated
      the American Mission of Francis James Jackson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following this diplomatic episode, Congress Wain sought a way of escape
      from the consequences of total nonintercourse. It finally enacted a bill
      known as Macon's Bill No. 2, which in a sense reversed the former policy,
      since it left commerce everywhere free, and authorized the President, "in
      case either Great Britain or France shall, before the 3d day of March
      next, so revoke or modify her edicts as that they shall cease to violate
      the neutral commerce of the United States," to cut off trade with the
      nation which continued to offend. The act thus gave the President an
      immense discretionary power which might bring the country face to face
      with war. It was the last act in that extraordinary series of restrictive
      measures which began with the Non-Intercourse Act of 1806. The policy of
      peaceful coercion entered on its last phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, once again, the shadow of the Corsican fell across the seas. With
      the unerring shrewdness of an intellect never vexed by ethical
      considerations, Napoleon announced that he would meet the desires of the
      American Government. "I am authorized to declare to you, Sir," wrote the
      Duc de Cadore, Minister of Foreign Affairs, to Armstrong, "that the
      Decrees of Berlin and Milan are revoked, and that after November 1 they
      will cease to have effect&mdash;it being understood that in consequence of
      this declaration the English are to revoke their Orders-in-Council, and
      renounce the new principles of blockade which they have wished to
      establish; or that the United States, conformably to the Act you have just
      communicated [the Macon Act], cause their rights to be respected by the
      English."
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be supposed that President Madison, knowing with whom he had to
      deal, would have hesitated to accept Napoleon's asseverations at their
      face value. He had, indeed, no assurances beyond Cadore's letter that the
      French decrees had been repealed. But he could not let slip this
      opportunity to force Great Britain's hand. It seemed to be a last chance
      to test the effectiveness of peaceable coercion. On November 2, 1810, he
      issued the momentous proclamation which eventually made Great Britain
      rather than France the object of attack. "It has been officially made
      known to this government," said the President, "that the said edicts of
      France have been so revoked as that they ceased, on the first day of the
      present month, to violate the neutral commerce of the United States."
      Thereupon the Secretary of the Treasury instructed collectors of customs
      that commercial intercourse with Great Britain would be suspended after
      the 2d of February of the following year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next three months were full of painful experiences for President
      Madison. He waited, and waited in vain, for authentic news of the formal
      repeal of the French decrees; and while he waited, he was distressed and
      amazed to learn that American vessels were still being confiscated in
      French ports. In the midst of these uncertainties occurred the biennial
      congressional elections, the outcome of which only deepened his
      perplexities. Nearly one-half of those who sat in the existing Congress
      failed of reelection, yet, by a vicious custom, the new House, which
      presumably reflected the popular mood in 1810, would not meet for thirteen
      months, while the old discredited Congress wearily dragged out its
      existence in a last session. Vigorous presidential leadership, it is true,
      might have saved the expiring Congress from the reproach of incapacity,
      but such leadership was not to be expected from James Madison.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that the President's message to this moribund Congress was
      simply a counsel of prudence and patience. It pointed out, to be sure, the
      uncertainties of the situation, but it did not summon Congress sternly to
      face the alternatives. It alluded mildly to the need of a continuance of
      our defensive and precautionary arrangements, and suggested further
      organization and training of the militia; it contemplated with
      satisfaction the improvement of the quantity and quality of the output of
      cannon and small arms; it set the seal of the President's approval upon
      the new military academy; but nowhere did it sound a trumpet-call to real
      preparedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even to these mild suggestions Congress responded indifferently. It
      slightly increased the naval appropriations, but it actually reduced the
      appropriations for the army; and it adjourned without acting on the bill
      authorizing the President to enroll fifty thousand volunteers. Personal
      animosity and prejudice combined to defeat the proposals of the Secretary
      of the Treasury. A bill to recharter the national bank, which Gallatin
      regarded as an indispensable fiscal agent, was defeated; and a bill
      providing for a general increase of duties on imports to meet the deficit
      was laid aside. Congress would authorize a loan of five million dollars
      but no new taxes. Only one bill was enacted which could be said to sustain
      the President's policy&mdash;that reviving certain parts of the
      Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 against Great Britain. With this last helpless
      gasp the Eleventh Congress expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defeat of measures which the Administration had made its own amounted
      to a vote of no confidence. Under similar circumstances an English
      Ministry would have either resigned or tested the sentiment of the country
      by a general election; but the American Executive possesses no such means
      of appealing immediately and directly to the electorate. President and
      Congress must live out their allotted terms of office, even though their
      antagonism paralyzes the operation of government. What, then, could be
      done to restore confidence in the Administration of President Madison and
      to establish a modus vivendi between Executive and Legislative?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to the Secretary of Treasury, smarting under the defeat of his
      bank bill, that he had become a burden to the Administration, an obstacle
      in the way of cordial cooperation between the branches of the Federal
      Government. The factions which had defeated his appointment to the
      Department of State seemed bent upon discrediting him and his policies. "I
      clearly perceive," he wrote to the President, "that my continuing a member
      of the present Administration is no longer of any public utility,
      invigorates the opposition against yourself, and must necessarily be
      attended with an increased loss of reputation by myself. Under those
      impressions, not without reluctance, and after perhaps hesitating too long
      in the hopes of a favorable change, I beg leave to tender you my
      resignation."
    </p>
    <p>
      This timely letter probably saved the Administration. Not for an instant
      could the President consider sacrificing the man who for ten years had
      been the mainstay of Republican power. Madison acted with unwonted
      promptitude. He refused to accept Gallatin's resignation, and determined
      to break once and for all with the faction which had hounded Gallatin from
      the day of his appointment and which had foisted upon the President an
      unwelcome Secretary of State. Not Gallatin but Robert Smith should go.
      Still more surprising was Madison's quick decision to name Monroe as
      Smith's successor, if he could be prevailed upon to accept. Both
      Virginians understood the deeper personal and political significance of
      this appointment. Madison sought an alliance with a faction which had
      challenged his administrative policy; Monroe inferred that no opposition
      would be interposed to his eventual elevation to the Presidency when
      Madison should retire. What neither for the moment understood was the
      effect which the appointment would have upon the foreign policy of the
      Administration. Monroe hesitated, for he and his friends had been open
      critics of the President's pro-French policy. Was the new Secretary of
      State to be bound by this policy, or was the President prepared to reverse
      his course and effect a reconciliation with England?
    </p>
    <p>
      These very natural misgivings the President brushed aside by assuring
      Monroe's friends that he was very hopeful of settling all differences with
      both France and England. Certainly he had in no wise committed himself to
      a course which would prevent a renewal of negotiations with England; he
      had always desired "a cordial accommodation." Thus reassured, Monroe
      accepted the invitation, never once doubting that he would reverse the
      policy of the Administration, achieve a diplomatic triumph, and so appear
      as the logical successor to President Madison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the new Secretary of State known the instructions which the British
      Foreign Office was drafting at this moment for Mr. Augustus J. Foster,
      Jackson's successor, he would have been less sanguine. This "very
      gentlemanlike young man," as Jackson called him, was told to make some
      slight concessions to American sentiment&mdash;he might make proper amends
      for the Chesapeake affair but on the crucial matter of the French decrees
      he was bidden to hold rigidly to the uncompromising position taken by the
      Foreign Office from the beginning&mdash;that the President was mistaken in
      thinking that they had been repealed. The British Government could not
      modify its orders-in-council on unsubstantiated rumors that the offensive
      French decrees had been revoked. Secretly Foster was informed that the
      Ministry was prepared to retaliate if the American Government persisted in
      shutting out British importations. No one in the ministry, or for that
      matter in the British Isles, seems to have understood that the moment had
      come for concession and not retaliation, if peaceful relations were to
      continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was most unfortunate that while Foster was on his way to the United
      States, British cruisers would have renewed the blockade of New York. Two
      frigates, the Melampus and the Guerriere, lay off Sandy Hook and resumed
      the old irritating practice of holding up American vessels and searching
      them for deserters. In the existing state of American feeling, with the
      Chesapeake outrage still unredressed, the behavior of the British
      commanders was as perilous as walking through a powder magazine with a
      live coal. The American navy had suffered severely from Jefferson's
      "chaste reformation" but it had not lost its fighting spirit. Officers who
      had served in the war with Tripoli prayed for a fair chance to avenge the
      Chesapeake; and the Secretary of the Navy had abetted this spirit in his
      orders to Commodore John Rodgers, who was patrolling the coast with a
      squadron of frigates and sloops. "What has been perpetrated," Rodgers was
      warned, "may be again attempted. It is therefore our duty to be prepared
      and determined at every hazard to vindicate the injured honor of our navy,
      and revive the drooping spirit of the nation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the circumstances it would have been little short of a miracle if an
      explosion had not occurred; yet for a year Rodgers sailed up and down the
      coast without encountering the British frigates. On May 16, 1811, however,
      Rodgers in his frigate, the President, sighted a suspicious vessel some
      fifty miles off Cape Henry. From her general appearance he judged her to
      be a man-of-war and probably the Guerriere. He decided to approach her, he
      relates, in order to ascertain whether a certain seaman alleged to have
      been impressed was aboard; but the vessel made off and he gave chase. By
      dusk the two ships were abreast. Exactly what then happened will probably
      never be known, but all accounts agree that a shot was fired and that a
      general engagement followed. Within fifteen minutes the strange vessel was
      disabled and lay helpless under the guns of the President, with nine of
      her crew dead and twenty-three wounded. Then, to his intense
      disappointment, Rodgers learned that his adversary was not the Guerriere
      but the British sloop of war Little Belt, a craft greatly inferior to his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      However little this one-sided sea fight may have salved the pride of the
      American navy, it gave huge satisfaction to the general public. The
      Chesapeake was avenged. When Foster disembarked he found little interest
      in the reparations which he was charged to offer. He had been prepared to
      settle a grievance in a good-natured way; he now felt himself obliged to
      demand explanations. The boot was on the other leg; and the American
      public lost none of the humor of the situation. Eventually he offered to
      disavow Admiral Berkeley's act, to restore the seamen taken from the
      Chesapeake, and to compensate them and their families. In the course of
      time the two unfortunates who had survived were brought from their prison
      at Halifax and restored to the decks of the Chesapeake in Boston Harbor.
      But as for the Little Belt, Foster had to rest content with the findings
      of an American court of inquiry which held that the British sloop had
      fired the first shot. As yet there were no visible signs that Monroe had
      effected a change in the foreign policy of the Administration, though he
      had given the President a momentary advantage over the opposition. Another
      crisis was fast approaching. When Congress met a month earlier than usual,
      pursuant to the call of the President, the leadership passed from the
      Administration to a group of men who had lost all faith in commercial
      restrictions as a weapon of defense against foreign aggression.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE WAR-HAWKS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the many unsolved problems which Jefferson bequeathed to his
      successor in office was that of the southern frontier. Running like a
      shuttle through the warp of his foreign policy had been his persistent
      desire to acquire possession of the Spanish Floridas. This dominant
      desire, amounting almost to a passion, had mastered even his better
      judgment and had created dilemmas from which he did not escape without the
      imputation of duplicity. On his retirement he announced that he was
      leaving all these concerns "to be settled by my friend, Mr. Madison," yet
      he could not resist the desire to direct the course of his successor.
      Scarcely a month after he left office he wrote, "I suppose the conquest of
      Spain will soon force a delicate question on you as to the Floridas and
      Cuba, which will offer themselves to you. Napoleon will certainly give his
      consent without difficulty to our receiving the Floridas, and with some
      difficulty possibly Cuba."
    </p>
    <p>
      In one respect Jefferson's intuition was correct. The attempt of Napoleon
      to subdue Spain and to seat his brother Joseph once again on the throne of
      Ferdinand VII was a turning point in the history of the Spanish colonies
      in America. One by one they rose in revolt and established revolutionary
      juntas either in the name of their deposed King or in professed
      cooperation with the insurrectionary government which was resisting the
      invader. Events proved that independence was the inevitable issue of all
      these uprisings from the Rio de la Plata to the Rio Grande.
    </p>
    <p>
      In common with other Spanish provinces, West Florida felt the impact of
      this revolutionary spirit, but it lacked natural unity and a dominant
      Spanish population. The province was in fact merely a strip of coast
      extending from the Perdido River to the Mississippi, indented with bays
      into which great rivers from the north discharged their turgid waters.
      Along these bays and rivers were scattered the inhabitants, numbering less
      than one hundred thousand, of whom a considerable portion had come from
      the States. There, as always on the frontier, land had been a lodestone
      attracting both the speculator and the homeseeker. In the parishes of West
      Feliciana and Baton Rouge, in the alluvial bottoms of the Mississippi, and
      in the settlements around Mobile Bay, American settlers predominated,
      submitting with ill grace to the exactions of Spanish officials who were
      believed to be as corrupt as they were inefficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      If events had been allowed to take their natural course, West Florida
      would in all probability have fallen into the arms of the United States as
      Texas did three decades later. But the Virginia Presidents were too ardent
      suitors to await the slow progress of events; they meant to assist
      destiny. To this end President Jefferson had employed General Wilkinson,
      with indifferent success. President Madison found more trustworthy agents
      in Governor Claiborne of New Orleans and Governor Holmes of Mississippi,
      whose letters reveal the extent to which Madison was willing to meddle
      with destiny. "Nature had decreed the union of Florida with the United
      States," Claiborne affirmed; but he was not so sure that nature could be
      left to execute her own decrees, for he strained every nerve to prepare
      the way for American intervention when the people of West Florida should
      declare themselves free from Spain. Holmes also was instructed to prepare
      for this eventuality and to cooperate with Claiborne in West Florida "in
      diffusing the impressions we wish to be made there."
    </p>
    <p>
      The anticipated insurrection came off just when and where nature had
      decreed. In the summer of 1810 a so-called "movement for self-government"
      started at Bayou Sara and at Baton Rouge, where nine-tenths of the
      inhabitants were Americans. The leaders took pains to assure the Spanish
      Commandant that their motives were unimpeachable: nothing should be done
      which would in any wise conflict with the authority of their "loved and
      worthy sovereign, Don Ferdinand VII." They wished to relieve the people of
      the abuses under which they were suffering, but all should be done in the
      name of the King. The Commandant, De Lassus, was not without his
      suspicions of these patriotic gentlemen but he allowed himself to be swept
      along in the current. The several movements finally coalesced on the 25th
      of July in a convention near Baton Rouge, which declared itself "legally
      constituted to act in all cases of national concern... with the consent of
      the governor" and professed a desire "to promote the safety, honor, and
      happiness of our beloved king" as well as to rectify abuses in the
      province. It adjourned with the familiar Spanish salutation which must
      have sounded ironical to the helpless De Lassus, "May God preserve you
      many years!" Were these pious professions farcical? Or were they the
      sincere utterances of men who, like the patriots of 1776, were driven by
      the march of events out of an attitude of traditional loyalty to the King
      into open defence of his authority?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Commandant was thus thrust into a position where his every movement
      would be watched with distrust. The pretext for further action was soon
      given. An intercepted letter revealed that DeLassus had written to
      Governor Folch for an armed force. That "act of perfidy" was enough to
      dissolve the bond between the convention and the Commandant. On the 23d of
      September, under cover of night, an armed force shouting "Hurrah!
      Washington!" overpowered the garrison of the fort at Baton Rouge, and
      three days later the convention declared the independence of West Florida,
      "appealing to the Supreme Ruler of the World" for the rectitude of their
      intentions. What their intentions were is clear enough. Before the ink was
      dry on their declaration of independence, they wrote to the Administration
      at Washington, asking for the immediate incorporation of West Florida into
      the Union. Here was the blessed consummation of years of diplomacy near at
      hand. President Madison had only to reach out his hand and pluck the ripe
      fruit; yet he hesitated from constitutional scruples. Where was the
      authority which warranted the use of the army and navy to hold territory
      beyond the bounds of the United States? Would not intervention, indeed, be
      equivalent to an unprovoked attack on Spain, a declaration of war? He set
      forth his doubts in a letter to Jefferson and hinted at the danger which
      in the end was to resolve all his doubts. Was there not grave danger that
      West Florida would pass into the hands of a third and dangerous party? The
      conduct of Great Britain showed a propensity to fish in troubled waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 27th of October, President Madison issued a proclamation
      authorizing Governor Claiborne to take possession of West Florida and to
      govern it as part of the Orleans Territory. He justified his action, which
      had no precedent in American diplomacy, by reasoning which was valid only
      if his fundamental premise was accepted. West Florida, he repeated, as a
      part of the Louisiana purchase belonged to the United States; but without
      abandoning its claim, the United States had hitherto suffered Spain to
      continue in possession, looking forward to a satisfactory adjustment by
      friendly negotiation. A crisis had arrived, however, which had subverted
      Spanish authority; and the failure of the United States to take the
      territory would threaten the interests of all parties and seriously
      disturb the tranquillity of the adjoining territories. In the hands of the
      United States, West Florida would "not cease to be a subject of fair and
      friendly negotiation." In his annual message President Madison spoke of
      the people of West Florida as having been "brought into the bosom of the
      American family," and two days later Governor Claiborne formally took
      possession of the country to the Pearl River. How territory which had thus
      been incorporated could still remain a subject of fair negotiation does
      not clearly appear, except on the supposition that Spain would go through
      the forms of a negotiation which could have but one outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemies of the Administration seized eagerly upon the flaws in the
      President's logic, and pressed his defenders sorely in the closing session
      of the Eleventh Congress. Conspicuous among the champions of the
      Administration was young Henry Clay, then serving out the term of Senator
      Thurston of Kentucky who had resigned his office. This eloquent young
      lawyer, now in his thirty-third year, had been born and bred in the Old
      Dominion&mdash;a typical instance of the American boy who had nothing but
      his own head and hands wherewith to make his way in the world. He had a
      slender schooling, a much-abbreviated law education in a lawyer's office,
      and little enough of that intellectual discipline needed for leadership at
      the bar; yet he had a clever wit, an engaging personality, and a rare
      facility in speaking, and he capitalized these assets. He was practising
      law in Lexington, Kentucky, when he was appointed to the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      What this persuasive Westerner had to say on the American title to West
      Florida was neither new nor convincing; but what he advocated as an
      American policy was both bold and challenging. "The eternal principles of
      self preservation" justified in his mind the occupation of West Florida,
      irrespective of any title. With Cuba and Florida in the possession of a
      foreign maritime power, the immense extent of country watered by streams
      entering the Gulf would be placed at the mercy of that power. Neglect the
      proffered boon and some nation profiting by this error would seize this
      southern frontier. It had been intimated that Great Britain might take
      sides with Spain to resist the occupation of Florida. To this covert
      threat Clay replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, is the time never to arrive, when we may manage our own affairs
      without the fear of insulting his Britannic Majesty? Is the rod of British
      power to be forever suspended over our heads? Does the President refuse to
      continue a correspondence with a minister, who violates the decorum
      belonging to his diplomatic character, by giving and deliberately
      repeating an affront to the whole nation? We are instantly menaced with
      the chastisement which English pride will not fail to inflict. Whether we
      assert our rights by sea, or attempt their maintenance by land&mdash;whithersoever
      we turn ourselves, this phantom incessantly pursues us. Already has it had
      too much influence on the councils of the nation. It contributed to the
      repeal of the embargo&mdash;that dishonorable repeal, which has so much
      tarnished the character of our government. Mr. President, I have before
      said on this floor, and now take occasion to remark, that I most sincerely
      desire peace and amity with England; that I even prefer an adjustment of
      all differences with her, before one with any other nation. But if she
      persists in a denial of justice to us, or if she avails herself of the
      occupation of West Florida, to commence war upon us, I trust and hope that
      all hearts will unite, in a bold and vigorous vindication of our rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not, sir, in favour of cherishing the passion of conquest. But I
      must be permitted, in conclusion, to indulge the hope of seeing, ere long,
      the NEW United States (if you will allow me the expression) embracing, not
      only the old thirteen States, but the entire country east of the
      Mississippi, including East Florida, and some of the territories of the
      north of us also."
    </p>
    <p>
      Conquest was not a familiar word in the vocabulary of James Madison, and
      he may well have prayed to be delivered from the hands of his friends, if
      this was to be the keynote of their defense of his policy in West Florida.
      Nevertheless, he was impelled in spite of himself in the direction of
      Clay's vision. If West Florida in the hands of an unfriendly power was a
      menace to the southern frontier, East Florida from the Perdido to the
      ocean was not less so. By the 3d of January, 1811, he was prepared to
      recommend secretly to Congress that he should be authorized to take
      temporary possession of East Florida, in case the local authorities should
      consent or a foreign power should attempt to occupy it. And Congress came
      promptly to his aid with the desired authorization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve months had now passed since the people of the several States had
      expressed a judgment at the polls by electing a new Congress. The Twelfth
      Congress was indeed new in more senses than one. Some seventy
      representatives took their seats for the first time, and fully half of the
      familiar faces were missing. Its first and most significant act, betraying
      a new spirit, was the choice as Speaker of Henry Clay, who had exchanged
      his seat in the Senate for the more stirring arena of the House. In all
      the history of the House there is only one other instance of the choice of
      a new member as Speaker. It was not merely a personal tribute to Clay but
      an endorsement of the forward-looking policy which he had so vigorously
      championed in the Senate. The temper of the House was bold and aggressive,
      and it saw its mood reflected in the mobile face of the young Kentuckian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker of the House had hitherto followed English traditions,
      choosing rather to stand as an impartial moderator than to act as a
      legislative leader. For British traditions of any sort Clay had little
      respect. He was resolved to be the leader of the House, and if necessary
      to join his privileges as Speaker to his rights as a member, in order to
      shape the policies of Congress. Almost his first act as Speaker was to
      appoint to important committees those who shared his impatience with
      commercial restrictions as a means of coercing Great Britain. On the
      Committee on Foreign Relations&mdash;second to none in importance at this
      moment&mdash;he placed Peter B. Porter of New York, young John C. Calhoun
      of South Carolina, and Felix Grundy of Tennessee; the chairmanship of the
      Committee on Naval Affairs he gave to Langdon Cheves of South Carolina;
      and the chairmanship of the Committee on Military Affairs, to another
      South Carolinian, David Williams. There was nothing fortuitous in this
      selection of representatives from the South and Southwest for important
      committee posts. Like Clay himself, these young intrepid spirits were
      solicitous about the southern frontier&mdash;about the ultimate disposal
      of the Floridas; like Clay, they had lost faith in temporizing policies;
      like Clay, they were prepared for battle with the old adversary if
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the President's message of November 5, 1811, there was just one passage
      which suited the mood of this group of younger Republicans. After a
      recital of injuries at the hands of the British ministry, Madison wrote
      with unwonted vigor: "With this evidence of hostile inflexibility in
      trampling on rights which no independent nation can relinquish Congress
      will feel the duty of putting the United States into an armor and an
      attitude demanded by the crisis; and corresponding with the national
      spirit and expectations." It was this part of the message which the
      Committee on Foreign Relations took for the text of its report. The time
      had arrived, in the opinion of the committee, when forbearance ceased to
      be a virtue and when Congress must as a sacred duty "call forth the
      patriotism and resources of the country." Nor did the committee hesitate
      to point out the immediate steps to be taken if the country were to be put
      into a state of preparedness. Let the ranks of the regular army be filled
      and ten regiments added; let the President call for fifty thousand
      volunteers; let all available war-vessels be put in commission; and let
      merchant vessels arm in their own defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      If these recommendations were translated into acts, they would carry the
      country appreciably nearer war; but the members of the committee were not
      inclined to shrink from the consequences. To a man they agreed that war
      was preferable to inglorious submission to continued outrages, and that
      the outcome of war would be positively advantageous. Porter, who
      represented the westernmost district of a State profoundly interested in
      the northern frontier, doubted not that Great Britain could be despoiled
      of her extensive provinces along the borders to the North. Grundy,
      speaking for the Southwest, contemplated with satisfaction the time when
      the British would be driven from the continent. "I feel anxious," he
      concluded, "not only to add the Floridas to the South, but the Canadas to
      the North of this Empire." Others, like Calhoun, who now made his entrance
      as a debater, refused to entertain these mercenary calculations. "Sir,"
      exclaimed Calhoun, his deep-set eyes flashing, "I only know of one
      principle to make a nation great, to produce in this country not the form
      but the real spirit of union, and that is, to protect every citizen in the
      lawful pursuit of his business... Protection and patriotism are
      reciprocal."
    </p>
    <p>
      But these young Republicans marched faster than the rank and file. Not so
      lightly were Jeffersonian traditions to be thrown aside. The old
      Republican prejudice against standing armies and seagoing navies still
      survived. Four weary months of discussion produced only two measures of
      military importance, one of which provided for the addition to the army of
      twenty-five thousand men enlisted for five years, and the other for the
      calling into service of fifty thousand state militia. The proposal of the
      naval committee to appropriate seven and a half million dollars to build a
      new navy was voted down; Gallatin's urgent appeal for new taxes fell upon
      deaf ears; and Congress proposed to meet the new military expenditure by
      the dubious expedient of a loan of eleven million dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hesitation which seemed fatal paralyzed all branches of the Federal
      Government in the spring months. Congress was obviously reluctant to
      follow the lead of the radicals who clamored for war with Great Britain.
      The President was unwilling to recommend a declaration of war, though all
      evidence points to the conclusion that he and his advisers believed war
      inevitable. The nation was divided in sentiment, the Federalists insisting
      with some plausibility that France was as great an offender as Great
      Britain and pointing to the recent captures of American merchantmen by
      French cruisers as evidence that the decrees had not been repealed. Even
      the President was impressed by these unfriendly acts and soberly discussed
      with his mentor at Monticello the possibility of war with both France and
      England. There was a moment in March, indeed, when he was disposed to
      listen to moderate Republicans who advised him to send a special mission
      to England as a last chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were the considerations which fixed the mind of the nation and of
      Congress upon war with Great Britain? Merely to catalogue the accumulated
      grievances of a decade does not suffice. Nations do not arrive at
      decisions by mathematical computation of injuries received, but rather
      because of a sense of accumulated wrongs which may or may not be measured
      by losses in life and property. And this sense of wrongs is the more acute
      in proportion to the racial propinquity of the offender. The most bitter
      of all feuds are those between peoples of the same blood. It was just
      because the mother country from which Americans had won their independence
      was now denying the fruits of that independence that she became the object
      of attack. In two particulars was Great Britain offending and France not.
      The racial differences between French and American seamen were too
      conspicuous to countenance impressment into the navy of Napoleon. No
      injuries at the hands of France bore any similarity to the Chesapeake
      outrage. Nor did France menace the frontier and the frontier folk of the
      United States by collusion with the Indians.
    </p>

      To suppose that the settlers beyond the Alleghanies were eager to fight
      Great Britain solely for "free trade and sailors' rights" is to assume a
      stronger consciousness of national unity than existed anywhere in the
      United States at this time. These western pioneers had stronger and more
      immediate motives for a reckoning with the old adversary. Their occupation
      of the Northwest had been hindered at every turn by the red man, who, they
      believed, had been sustained in his resistance directly by British traders
      and indirectly by the British Government. Documents now abundantly prove
      that the suspicion was justified. The key to the early history of the
      northwestern frontier is the fur trade. It was for this lucrative traffic
      that England retained so long the western posts which she had agreed to
      surrender by the Peace of Paris. Out of the region between the Illinois,
      the Wabash, the Ohio, and Lake Erie, pelts had been shipped year after
      year to the value annually of some 100,000 pounds, in return for the
      products of British looms and forges. It was the constant aim of the
      British trader in the Northwest to secure "the exclusive advantages of a
      valuable trade during Peace and the zealous assistance of brave and useful
      auxiliaries in time of War." To dispossess the redskin of his lands and to
      wrest the fur trade from British control was the equally constant desire
      of every full-blooded Western American. Henry Clay voiced this desire when
      he exclaimed in the speech already quoted, "The conquest of Canada is in
      your power.... Is it nothing to extinguish the torch that lights up savage
      warfare? Is it nothing to acquire the entire fur-trade connected with that
      country, and to destroy the temptation and opportunity of violating your
      revenue and other laws?" *

     * A memorial of the fur traders of Canada to the Secretary
     of State for War and Colonies (1814), printed as Appendix N
     to Davidson's "The North West Company," throws much light on
     this obscure feature of Western history. See also an article
     on "The Insurgents of 1811," in the American Historical
     Association "Report" (1911) by D. R. Anderson.

      The Twelfth Congress had met under the shadow of an impending catastrophe
      in the Northwest. Reports from all sources pointed to an Indian war of
      considerable magnitude. Tecumseh and his brother the Prophet had formed an
      Indian confederacy which was believed to embrace not merely the tribes of
      the Northwest but also the Creeks and Seminoles of the Gulf region.
      Persistent rumors strengthened long-nourished suspicions and connected
      this Indian unrest with the British agents on the Canadian border. In the
      event of war, so it was said, the British paymasters would let the
      redskins loose to massacre helpless women and children. Old men retold the
      outrages of these savage fiends during the War of Independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 7th of November&mdash;three days after the assembling of Congress&mdash;Governor
      William Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory encountered the Indians of
      Tecumseh's confederation at Tippecanoe and by a costly but decisive
      victory crushed the hopes of their chieftains. As the news of these events
      drifted into Washington, it colored perceptibly the minds of those who
      doubted whether Great Britain or France were the greater offender. Grundy,
      who had seen three brothers killed by Indians and his mother reduced from
      opulence to poverty in a single night, spoke passionately of that power
      which was taking every "opportunity of intriguing with our Indian
      neighbors and setting on the ruthless savages to tomahawk our women and
      children." "War," he exclaimed, "is not to commence by sea or land, it is
      already begun, and some of the richest blood of our country has been
      shed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the President hesitated to lead. On the 31st of March, to be sure,
      he suffered Monroe to tell a committee of the House that he thought war
      should be declared before Congress adjourned and that he was willing to
      recommend an embargo if Congress would agree; but after an embargo for
      ninety days had been declared on the 4th of April, he told the British
      Minister that it was not, could not be considered, a war measure. He still
      waited for Congress to shoulder the responsibility of declaring war. Why
      did he hesitate? Was he aware of the woeful state of unpreparedness
      everywhere apparent and was he therefore desirous of delay? Some color is
      given to this excuse by his efforts to persuade Congress to create two
      assistant secretaryships of war. Or was he conscious of his own inability
      to play the role of War-President?
    </p>
    <p>
      The personal question which thrust itself upon Madison at this time was,
      indeed, whether he would have a second term of office. An old story, often
      told by his detractors, recounts a dramatic incident which is said to have
      occurred, just as the congressional caucus of the party was about to meet.
      A committee of Republican Congressmen headed by Mr. Speaker Clay waited
      upon the President to tell him, that if he wished a renomination, he must
      agree to recommend a declaration of war. The story has never been
      corroborated; and the dramatic interview probably never occurred; yet the
      President knew, as every one knew, that his renomination was possible only
      with the support of the war party. When he accepted the nomination from
      the Republican caucus on the 18th of May, he tacitly pledged himself to
      acquiesce in the plans of the war-hawks. Some days later an authentic
      interview did take place between the President and a deputation of
      Congressmen headed by the Speaker, in the course of which the President
      was assured of the support of Congress if he would recommend a
      declaration. Subsequent events point to a complete understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clay now used all the latent powers of his office to aid the war party.
      Even John Randolph, ever a thorn in the side of the party, was made to
      wince. On the 9th of May, Randolph undertook to address the House on the
      declaration of war which, he had been credibly informed, was imminent. He
      was called to order by a member because no motion was before the House. He
      protested that his remarks were prefatory to a motion. The Speaker ruled
      that he must first make a motion. "My proposition is," responded Randolph
      sullenly, "that it is not expedient at this time to resort to a war
      against Great Britain." "Is the motion seconded?" asked the Speaker.
      Randolph protested that a second was not needed and appealed from the
      decision of the chair. Then, when the House sustained the Speaker,
      Randolph, having found a seconder, once more began to address the House.
      Again he was called to order; the House must first vote to consider the
      motion. Randolph was beside himself with rage. The last vestige of liberty
      of speech was vanishing, he declared. But Clay was imperturbable. The
      question of consideration was put and lost. Randolph had found his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of June the President sent to Congress what is usually
      denominated a war message; yet it contained no positive recommendation of
      war. "Congress must decide," said the President, "whether the United
      States shall continue passive" or oppose force to force. Prefaced to this
      impotent conclusion was a long recital of "progressive usurpations" and
      "accumulating wrongs"&mdash;a recital which had become so familiar in
      state papers as almost to lose its power to provoke popular resentment. It
      was significant, however, that the President put in the forefront of his
      catalogue of wrongs the impressment of American sailors on the high seas.
      No indignity touched national pride so keenly and none so clearly
      differentiated Great Britain from France as the national enemy. Almost
      equally provocative was the harassing of incoming and outgoing vessels by
      British cruisers which hovered off the coasts and even committed
      depredations within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.
      Pretended blockades without an adequate force was a third charge against
      the British Government, and closely connected with it that "sweeping
      system of blockades, under the name of orders-in-council," against which
      two Republican Administrations had struggled in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in the count not an item, indeed, which could not have been
      charged against Great Britain in the fall of 1807, when the public
      clamored for war after the Chesapeake outrage. Four long years had been
      spent in testing the efficacy of commercial restrictions, and the country
      was if anything less prepared for the alternative. When President Madison
      penned this message he was, in fact, making public avowal of the breakdown
      of a great Jeffersonian principle. Peaceful coercion was proved to be an
      idle dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      So well advised was the Committee on Foreign Relations to which the
      President's message was referred that it could present a long report two
      days later, again reviewing the case against the adversary in great
      detail. "The contest which is now forced on the United States," it
      concluded, "is radically a contest for their sovereignty and
      independency." There was now no other alternative than an immediate appeal
      to arms. On the same day Calhoun introduced a bill declaring war against
      Great Britain; and on the 4th of June in secret session the war party
      mustered by the Speaker bore down all opposition and carried the bill by a
      vote of 79 to 49. On the 7th of June the Senate followed the House by the
      close vote of 19 to 14; and on the following day the President promptly
      signed the bill which marked the end of an epoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the bitterest ironies in history that just twenty-four hours
      before war was declared at Washington, the new Ministry at Westminster
      announced its intention of immediately suspending the orders-in-council.
      Had President Madison yielded to those moderates who advised him in April
      to send a minister to England, he might have been apprized of that gradual
      change in public opinion which was slowly undermining the authority of
      Spencer Perceval's ministry and commercial system. He had only to wait a
      little longer to score the greatest diplomatic triumph of his generation;
      but fate willed otherwise. No ocean cable flashed the news of the abrupt
      change which followed the tragic assassination of Perceval and the
      formation of a new ministry. When the slow-moving packets brought the
      tidings, war had begun.

      CHAPTER XI. PRESIDENT MADISON UNDER FIRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dire calamity which Jefferson and his colleagues had for ten years
      bent all their energies to avert had now befallen the young Republic. War,
      with all its train of attendant evils, stalked upon the stage, and was
      about to test the hearts of pacifist and war-hawk alike. But nothing
      marked off the younger Republicans more sharply from the generation to
      which Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin belonged than the positive relief
      with which they hailed this break with Jeffersonian tradition. This
      attitude was something quite different from the usual intrepidity of youth
      in the face of danger; it was bottomed upon the conviction which Clay
      expressed when he answered the question, "What are we to gain by the war?"
      by saying, "What are we not to lose by peace? Commerce, character, a
      nation's best treasure, honor!" Calhoun had reached the same conclusion.
      The restrictive system as a means of resistance and of obtaining redress
      for wrongs, he declared to be unsuited to the genius of the American
      people. It required the most arbitrary laws; it rendered government
      odious; it bred discontent. War, on the other hand, strengthened the
      national character, fed the flame of patriotism, and perfected the
      organization of government. "Sir," he exclaimed, "I would prefer a single
      Victory over the enemy by sea or land to all the good we shall ever derive
      from the continuation of the non-importation act!" The issue was thus
      squarely faced: the alternative to peaceable coercion was now to be given
      a trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely less remarkable was the buoyant spirit with which these young
      Republicans faced the exigencies of war. Defeat was not to be found in
      their vocabulary. Clay pictured in fervent rhetoric a victorious army
      dictating the terms of peace at Quebec or at Halifax; Calhoun scouted the
      suggestion of unpreparedness, declaring that in four weeks after the
      declaration of war the whole of Upper and part of Lower Canada would be in
      our possession; and even soberer patriots believed that the conquest of
      Canada was only a matter of marching across the frontier to Montreal or
      Quebec. But for that matter older heads were not much wiser as prophets of
      military events. Even Jefferson assured the President that he had never
      known a war entered into under more favorable auspices, and predicted that
      Great Britain would surely be stripped of all her possessions on this
      continent; while Monroe seems to have anticipated a short decisive war
      terminating in a satisfactory accommodation with England. As for the
      President, he averred many years later that while he knew the unprepared
      state of the country, "he esteemed it necessary to throw forward the flag
      of the country, sure that the people would press onward and defend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something at once humorous and pathetic in this self-portrait of
      Madison throwing forward the flag of his country and summoning his legions
      to follow on. Never was a man called to lead in war who had so little of
      the martial in his character, and yet so earnest a purpose to rise to the
      emergency. An observer describes him, the day after war was declared,
      "visiting in person&mdash;a thing never known before&mdash;all the offices
      of the Departments of War and the Navy, stimulating everything in a manner
      worthy of a little commander-in-chief, with his little round hat and huge
      cockade." Stimulation was certainly needed in these two departments as
      events proved, but attention to petty details which should have been
      watched by subordinates is not the mark of a great commander. Jefferson
      afterward consoled Madison for the defeat of his armies by writing: "All
      you can do is to order&mdash;execution must depend on others and failures
      be imputed to them alone." Jefferson failed to perceive what Madison seems
      always to have forgotten, that a commander-in-chief who appoints and may
      remove his subordinates can never escape responsibility for their
      failures. The President's first duty was not to stimulate the performance
      of routine in the departments but to make sure of the competence of the
      executive heads of those departments.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Eustis of Massachusetts, Secretary of War, was not without some
      little military experience, having served as a surgeon in the
      Revolutionary army, but he lacked every qualification for the onerous task
      before him. Senator Crawford of Georgia wrote to Monroe caustically that
      Eustis should have been forming general and comprehensive arrangements for
      the organization of the troops and for the prosecution of campaigns,
      instead of consuming his time reading advertisements of petty retailing
      merchants, to find where he could purchase one hundred shoes or two
      hundred hats. Of Paul Hamilton, the Secretary of Navy, even less could be
      expected, for he seems to have had absolutely no experience to qualify him
      for the post. Senator Crawford intimated that in instructing his naval
      officers Hamilton impressed upon them the desirability of keeping their
      superiors supplied with pineapples and other tropical fruits&mdash;an
      ill-natured comment which, true or not, gives us the measure of the man.
      Both Monroe and Gallatin shared the prevailing estimate of the Secretaries
      of War and of the Navy and expressed themselves without reserve to
      Jefferson; but the President with characteristic indecision hesitated to
      purge his Cabinet of these two incompetents, and for his want of decision
      he paid dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President had just left the Capital for his country place at
      Montpelier toward the end of August, when the news came that General
      William Hull, who had been ordered to invade Upper Canada and begin the
      military promenade to Quebec, had surrendered Detroit and his entire army
      without firing a gun. It was a crushing disaster and a well-deserved
      rebuke for the Administration, for whether the fault was Hull's or
      Eustis's, the President had to shoulder the responsibility. His first
      thought was to retrieve the defeat by commissioning Monroe to command a
      fresh army for the capture of Detroit; but this proposal which appealed
      strongly to Monroe had to be put aside&mdash;fortunately for all
      concerned, for Monroe's desire for military glory was probably not
      equalled by his capacity as a commander and the western campaign proved
      incomparably more difficult than wiseacres at Washington imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was needed, indeed, was not merely able commanders in the field,
      though they were difficult enough to find. There was much truth in
      Jefferson's naive remark to Madison: "The creator has not thought proper
      to mark those on the forehead who are of the stuff to make good generals.
      We are first, therefore, to seek them, blindfold, and then let them learn
      the trade at the expense of great losses." But neither seems to have
      comprehended that their opposition to military preparedness had caused
      this dearth of talent and was now forcing the Administration to select
      blindfold. More pressing even than the need of tacticians was the need of
      organizers of victory. The utter failure of the Niagara campaign vacated
      the office of Secretary of War; and with Eustis retired also the Secretary
      of the Navy. Monroe took over the duties of the one temporarily, and
      William Jones, a shipowner of Philadelphia, succeeded Hamilton.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the President seriously intended to make Monroe Secretary of War and
      the head of the General Staff, he speedily discovered that he was
      powerless to do so. The Republican leaders in New York felt too keenly
      Josiah Quincy's taunt about a despotic Cabinet "composed, to all efficient
      purposes, of two Virginians and a foreigner" to permit Monroe to absorb
      two cabinet posts. To appease this jealousy of Virginia, Madison made an
      appointment which very nearly shipwrecked his Administration: he invited
      General John Armstrong of New York to become Secretary of War. Whatever
      may be said of Armstrong's qualifications for the post, his presence in
      the Cabinet was most inadvisable, for he did not and could not inspire the
      personal confidence of either Gallatin or Monroe. Once in office, he
      turned Monroe into a relentless enemy and fairly drove Gallatin out of
      office in disgust by appointing his old enemy, William Duane, editor of
      the Aurora, to the post of Adjutant-General. "And Armstrong!"&mdash;said
      Dallas who subsequently as Secretary of War knew whereof he spoke&mdash;"he
      was the devil from the beginning, is now, and ever will be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of clearest vision in these unhappy months of 1812 was undoubtedly
      Albert Gallatin. The defects of Madison as a War-President he had long
      foreseen; the need of reorganizing the Executive Departments he had
      pointed out as soon as war became inevitable; and the problem of financing
      the war he had attacked farsightedly, fearlessly, and without regard to
      political consistency. No one watched the approach of hostilities with a
      bitterer sense of blasted hopes. For ten years he had labored to limit
      expenditures, sacrificing even the military and naval establishments, that
      the people might be spared the burden of needless taxes;&mdash;and within
      this decade he had also scaled down the national debt one-half, so that
      posterity might not be saddled with burdens not of its own choosing. And
      now war threatened to undo his work. The young republic was after all not
      to lead its own life, realize a unique destiny, but to tread the old
      well-worn path of war, armaments, and high-handed government. Well, he
      would save what he could, do his best to avert "perpetual taxation,
      military establishments, and other corrupting or anti-republican habits or
      institutions."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Gallatin at first underrated the probable revenue for war purposes, he
      speedily confessed his error and set before Congress inexorably the
      necessity for new taxes-aye, even for an internal tax, which he had once
      denounced as loudly as any Republican. For more than a year after the
      declaration of war, Congress was deaf to pleas for new sources of revenue;
      and it was not, indeed, until the last year of the war that it voted the
      taxes which in the long run could alone support the public credit.
      Meantime, facing a depleted Treasury, Gallatin found himself reduced to a
      mere "dealer of loans"&mdash;a position utterly abhorrent to him. Even his
      efforts to place the loans which Congress authorized must have failed but
      for the timely aid of three men whom Quincy would have contemptuously
      termed foreigners, for all like Gallatin were foreign-born&mdash;Astor,
      Girard, and Parish. Utterly weary of his thankless job, Gallatin seized
      upon the opportunity afforded by the Russian offer of mediation to leave
      the Cabinet and perhaps to end the war by a diplomatic stroke. He asked
      and received an appointment as one of the three American commissioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Madison really believed that the people of the United States would
      unitedly press onward and defend the flag when once he had thrown it
      forward, he must have been strangely insensitive to the disaffection in
      New England. Perhaps, like Jefferson in the days of the embargo, he
      mistook the spirit of this opposition, thinking that it was largely
      partisan clamor which could safely be disregarded. What neither of these
      Virginians appreciated was the peculiar fanatical and sectional character
      of this Federalist opposition, and the extremes to which it would go. Yet
      abundant evidence lay before their eyes. Thirty-four Federalist members of
      the House, nearly all from New England, issued an address to their
      constituents bitterly arraigning the Administration and deploring the
      declaration of war; the House of Representatives of Massachusetts,
      following this example, published another address, denouncing the war as a
      wanton sacrifice of the best interests of the people and imploring all
      good citizens to meet in town and county assemblies to protest and to
      resolve not to volunteer except for a defensive war; and a meeting of
      citizens of Rockingham County, New Hampshire, adopted a memorial drafted
      by young Daniel Webster, which hinted that the separation of the States&mdash;"an
      event fraught with incalculable evils"&mdash;might sometime occur on just
      such an occasion as this. Town after town, and county after county, took
      up the hue and cry, keeping well within the limits of constitutional
      opposition, it is true, but weakening the arm of the Government just when
      it should have struck the enemy effective blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the President without enemies in his own political household. The
      Republicans of New York, always lukewarm in their support of the Virginia
      Dynasty, were now bent upon preventing his reelection. They found a shrewd
      and not overscrupulous leader in DeWitt Clinton and an adroit campaign
      manager in Martin Van Buren. Both belonged to that school of New York
      politicians of which Burr had been master. Anything to beat Madison was
      their cry. To this end they were willing to condemn the war-policy, to
      promise a vigorous prosecution of the war, and even to negotiate for
      peace. What made this division in the ranks of the Republicans so serious
      was the willingness of the New England Federalists to make common cause
      with Clinton. In September a convention of Federalists endorsed his
      nomination for the Presidency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the weight of accumulating disasters, military and political, it
      seemed as though Madison must go down in defeat. Every New England State
      but Vermont cast its electoral votes for Clinton; all the Middle States
      but Pennsylvania also supported him; and Maryland divided its vote. Only
      the steadiness of the Southern Republicans and of Pennsylvania saved
      Madison; a change of twenty electoral votes would have ended the Virginia
      Dynasty.* Now at least Madison must have realized the poignant truth which
      the Federalists were never tired of repeating: he had entered upon the war
      as President of a divided people.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In the electoral vote Madison received 128; Clinton, 89.
</pre>
    <p>
      Only a few months' experience was needed to convince the military
      authorities at Washington that the war must be fought mainly by
      volunteers. Every military consideration derived from American history
      warned against this policy, it is true, but neither Congress nor the
      people would entertain for an instant the thought of conscription. Only
      with great reluctance and under pressure had Congress voted to increase
      the regular army and to authorize the President to raise fifty thousand
      volunteers. The results of this legislation were disappointing, not to say
      humiliating. The conditions of enlistment were not such as to encourage
      recruiting; and even when the pay had been increased and the term of
      service shortened, few able-bodied citizens would respond. If any such
      desired to serve their country, they enrolled in the State militia which
      the President had been authorized to call into active service for six
      months.
    </p>
    <p>
      In default of a well-disciplined regular army and an adequate volunteer
      force, the Administration was forced more and more to depend upon such
      quotas of militia as the States would supply. How precarious was the hold
      of the national Government upon the State forces, appeared in the first
      months of the war. When called upon to supply troops to relieve the
      regulars in the coast defenses, the governors of Massachusetts and
      Connecticut flatly refused, holding that the commanders of the State
      militia, and not the President, had the power to decide when exigencies
      demanded the use of the militia in the service of the United States. In
      his annual message Madison termed this "a novel and unfortunate
      exposition" of the Constitution, and he pointed out&mdash;what indeed was
      sufficiently obvious&mdash;that if the authority of the United States
      could be thus frustrated during actual war, "they are not one nation for
      the purpose most of all requiring it." But what was the President to do?
      Even if he, James Madison, author of the Virginia Resolutions of 1798,
      could so forget his political creed as to conceive of coercing a sovereign
      state, where was the army which would do his bidding? The President was
      the victim of his own political theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      These bitter revelations of 1812&mdash;the disaffection of New England,
      the incapacity of two of his secretaries, the disasters of his staff
      officers on the frontier, the slow recruiting, the defiance of
      Massachusetts and Connecticut&mdash;almost crushed the President. Never
      physically robust, he succumbed to an insidious intermittent fever in June
      and was confined to his bed for weeks. So serious was his condition that
      Mrs. Madison was in despair and scarcely left his side for five long
      weeks. "Even now," she wrote to Mrs. Gallatin, at the end of July, "I
      watch over him as I would an infant, so precarious is his convalescence."
      The rumor spread that he was not likely to survive, and politicians in
      Washington began to speculate on the succession to the Presidency.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now and then a ray of hope shot through the gloom pervading the White
      House and Capitol. The stirring victory of the Constitution over the
      Guerriere in August, 1812, had almost taken the sting out of Hull's
      surrender at Detroit, and other victories at sea followed, glorious in the
      annals of American naval warfare, though without decisive influence on the
      outcome of the war. Of much greater significance was Perry's victory on
      Lake Erie in September, 1813, which opened the way to the invasion of
      Canada. This brilliant combat followed by the Battle of the Thames cheered
      the President in his slow convalescence. Encouraging, too, were the
      exploits of American privateers in British waters, but none of these
      events seemed likely to hasten the end of the war. Great Britain had
      already declined the Russian offer of mediation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last day but one of the year 1813 a British schooner, the Bramble, came
      into the port of Annapolis bearing an important official letter from Lord
      Castlereagh to the Secretary of State. With what eager and anxious hands
      Monroe broke the seal of this letter may be readily imagined. It might
      contain assurances of a desire for peace; it might indefinitely prolong
      the war. In truth the letter pointed both ways. Castlereagh had declined
      to accept the good offices of Russia, but he was prepared to begin direct
      negotiations for peace. Meantime the war must go on&mdash;with the chances
      favoring British arms, for the Bramble had also brought the alarming news
      of Napoleon's defeat on the plains of Leipzig. Now for the first time
      Great Britain could concentrate all her efforts upon the campaign in North
      America. No wonder the President accepted Castlereagh's offer with
      alacrity. To the three commissioners sent to Russia, he added Henry Clay
      and Jonathan Russell and bade them Godspeed while he nerved himself to
      meet the crucial year of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the President been fully apprized of the elaborate plans of the
      British War Office, his anxieties would have been multiplied many times.
      For what resources had the Government to meet invasion on three frontiers?
      The Treasury was again depleted; new loans brought in insufficient funds
      to meet current expenses; recruiting was slack because the Government
      could not compete with the larger bounties offered by the States; by
      summer the number of effective regular troops was only twenty-seven
      thousand all told. With this slender force, supplemented by State levies,
      the military authorities were asked to repel invasion. The Administration
      had not yet drunk the bitter dregs of the cup of humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      That some part of the invading British forces might be detailed to attack
      the Capital was vaguely divined by the President and his Cabinet; but no
      adequate measures had been taken for the defense of the city when, on a
      fatal August day, the British army marched upon it. The humiliating story
      of the battle of Bladensburg has been told elsewhere. The disorganized mob
      which had been hastily assembled to check the advance of the British was
      utterly routed almost under the eyes of the President, who with feelings
      not easily described found himself obliged to join the troops fleeing
      through the city. No personal humiliation was spared the President and his
      family. Dolly Madison, never once doubting that the noise of battle which
      reached the White House meant an American victory, stayed calmly indoors
      until the rush of troops warned her of danger. She and her friends were
      then swept along in the general rout. She was forced to leave her personal
      effects behind, but her presence of mind saved one treasure in the White
      House&mdash;a large portrait of General Washington painted by Gilbert
      Stuart. That priceless portrait and the plate were all that survived. The
      fleeing militiamen had presence of mind enough to save a large quantity of
      the wine by drinking it, and what was left, together with the dinner on
      the table, was consumed by Admiral Cockburn and his staff. By nightfall
      the White House, the Treasury, and the War Office were in flames, and only
      a severe thunderstorm checked the conflagration.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Before passing judgment on the conduct of British officers
     and men in the capital, the reader should recall the equally
     indefensible outrages committed by American troops under
     General Dearborn in 1813, when the Houses of Parliament and
     other public buildings at York (Toronto) were pillaged and
     burned. See Kingsford's "History of Canada," VIII, pp. 259-
     61.
</pre>
    <p>
      Heartsick and utterly weary, the President crossed the Potomac at about
      six o'clock in the evening and started westward in a carriage toward
      Montpelier. He had been in the saddle since early morning and was nearly
      spent. To fatigue was added humiliation, for he was forced to travel with
      a crowd of embittered fugitives and sleep in a forlorn house by the
      wayside. Next morning he overtook Mrs. Madison at an inn some sixteen
      miles from the Capital. Here they passed another day of humiliation, for
      refugees who had followed the same line of flight reviled the President
      for betraying them and the city. At midnight, alarmed at a report that the
      British were approaching, the President fled to another miserable refuge
      deeper in the Virginia woods. This fear of capture was quite unfounded,
      however, for the British troops had already evacuated the city and were
      marching in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later the President returned to the capital to collect his
      Cabinet and repair his shattered Government. He found public sentiment hot
      against the Administration for having failed to protect the city. He had
      even to fear personal violence, but he remained "tranquil as usual...
      though much distressed by the dreadful event which had taken place." He
      was still more distressed, however, by the insistent popular clamor for a
      victim for punishment. All fingers pointed at Armstrong as the man
      responsible for the capture of the city. Armstrong offered to resign at
      once, but the President in distress would not hear of resignation. He
      would advise only "a temporary retirement" from the city to placate the
      inhabitants. So Armstrong departed, but by the time he reached Baltimore
      he realized the impossibility of his situation and sent his resignation to
      the President. The victim had been offered up. At his own request Monroe
      was now made Secretary of War, though he continued also to discharge the
      not very heavy duties of the State Department.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a disillusioned group of Congressmen who gathered in September,
      1814, in special session at the President's call. Among those who gazed
      sadly at the charred ruins of the Capitol were Calhoun, Cheves, and
      Grundy, whose voices had been loud for war and who had pictured their
      armies overrunning the British possessions. Clay was at this moment
      endeavoring to avert a humiliating surrender of American claims at Ghent.
      To the sting of defeated hopes was added physical discomfort. The only
      public building which had escaped the general conflagration was the Post
      and Patent Office. In these cramped quarters the two houses awaited the
      President's message.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visitor from another planet would have been strangely puzzled to make
      the President's words tally with the havoc wrought by the enemy on every
      side. A series of achievements had given new luster to the American arms;
      "the pride of our naval arms had been amply supported"; the American
      people had "rushed with enthusiasm to the scenes where danger and duty
      call." Not a syllable about the disaster at Washington! Not a word about
      the withdrawal of the Connecticut militia from national service, and the
      refusal of the Governor of Vermont to call out the militia just at the
      moment when Sir George Prevost began his invasion of New York; not a word
      about the general suspension of specie payment by all banks outside of New
      England; not a word about the failure of the last loan and the imminent
      bankruptcy of the Government. Only a single sentence betrayed the anxiety
      which was gnawing Madison's heart: "It is not to be disguised that the
      situation of our country calls for its greatest efforts." What the
      situation demanded, he left his secretaries to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new Secretary of War seemed to be the one member of the Administration
      who was prepared to grapple with reality and who had the courage of his
      convictions. While Jefferson was warning him that it was nonsense to talk
      about a regular army, Monroe told Congress flatly that no reliance could
      be pled in the militia and that a permanent force of one hundred thousand
      men must be raised&mdash;raised by conscription if necessary. Throwing
      Virginian and Jeffersonian principles to the winds, he affirmed the
      constitutional right of Congress to draft citizens. The educational value
      of war must have been very great to bring Monroe to this conclusion, but
      Congress had not traveled so far. One by one Monroe's alternative plans
      were laid aside; and the country, like a rudderless ship, drifted on.
    </p>
    <p>
      An insuperable obstacle, indeed, prevented the establishment of any
      efficient national army at this time. Every plan encountered ultimately
      the inexorable fact that the Treasury was practically empty and the credit
      of the Government gone. Secretary Campbell's report was a confession of
      failure to sustain public credit. Some seventy-four millions would be
      needed to carry the existing civil and military establishments for another
      year, and of this sum, vast indeed in those days, only twenty-four
      millions were in sight. Where the remaining fifty millions were to be
      found, the Secretary could not say. With this admission of incompetence
      Campbell resigned from office. On the 9th of November his successor, A. J.
      Dallas, notified holders of government securities at Boston that the
      Treasury could not meet its obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this crisis, when bankruptcy stared the Government in the face,
      that the Legislature of Massachusetts appointed delegates to confer with
      delegates from other New England legislatures on their common grievances
      and dangers and to devise means of security and defense. The Legislatures
      of Connecticut and Rhode Island responded promptly by appointing delegates
      to meet at Hartford on the 15th of December; and the proposed convention
      seemed to receive popular indorsement in the congressional elections, for
      with but two exceptions all the Congressmen chosen were Federalists.
      Hot-heads were discussing without any attempt at concealment the
      possibility of reconstructing the Federal Union. A new union of the good
      old Thirteen States on terms set by New England was believed to be well
      within the bounds of possibility. News-sheets referred enthusiastically to
      the erection of a new Federal edifice which should exclude the Western
      States. Little wonder that the harassed President in distant Washington
      was obsessed with the idea that New England was on the verge of secession.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Wirt who visited Washington at this time has left a vivid picture
      of ruin and desolation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went to look at the ruins of the President's house. The rooms which you
      saw so richly furnished, exhibited nothing but unroofed naked walls,
      cracked, defaced, and blackened with fire. I cannot tell you what I felt
      as I walked amongst them.... I called on the President. He looks miserably
      shattered and wobegone. In short, he looked heartbroken. His mind is full
      of the New England sedition. He introduced the subject, and continued to
      press it&mdash;painful as it obviously was to him. I denied the
      probability, even the possibility that the yeomanry of the North could be
      induced to place themselves under the power and protection of England, and
      diverted the conversation to another topic; but he took the first
      opportunity to return to it, and convinced me that his heart and mind were
      painfully full of the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      What added to the President's misgivings was the secrecy in which the
      members of the Hartford Convention shrouded their deliberations. An
      atmosphere of conspiracy seemed to envelop all their proceedings. That the
      "deliverance of New England" was at hand was loudly proclaimed by the
      Federalist press. A reputable Boston news-sheet advised the President to
      procure a faster horse than he had mounted at Bladensburg, if he would
      escape the swift vengeance of New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of the Hartford Convention seemed hardly commensurate with the
      fears of the President or with the windy boasts of the Federalist press.
      It arraigned the Administration in scathing language, to be sure, but it
      did not advise secession. "The multiplied abuses of bad administrations"
      did not yet justify a severance of the Union, especially in a time of war.
      The manifest defects of the Constitution were not incurable; yet the
      infractions of the Constitution by the National Government had been so
      deliberate, dangerous, and palpable as to put the liberties of the people
      in jeopardy and to constrain the several States to interpose their
      authority to protect their citizens. The legislatures of the several
      States were advised to adopt measures to protect their citizens against
      such unconstitutional acts of Congress as conscription and to concert some
      arrangement with the Government at Washington, whereby they jointly or
      separately might undertake their own defense, and retain a reasonable
      share of the proceeds of Federal taxation for that purpose. To remedy the
      defects of the Constitution seven amendments were proposed, all of which
      had their origin in sectional hostility to the ascendancy of Virginia and
      to the growing power of the New West. The last of these proposals was a
      shot at Madison and Virginia: "nor shall the President be elected from the
      same State two terms in succession." And finally, should these
      applications of the States for permission to arm in their own defense be
      ignored, then and in the event that peace should not be concluded, another
      convention should be summoned "with such powers and instructions as the
      exigency of a crisis so momentous may require."
    </p>
    <p>
      Massachusetts, under Federalist control, acted promptly upon these
      suggestions. Three commissioners were dispatched to Washington to effect
      the desired arrangements for the defense of the State. The progress of
      these "three ambassadors," as they styled themselves, was followed with
      curiosity if not with apprehension. In Federalist circles there was a
      general belief that an explosion was at hand. A disaster at New Orleans,
      which was now threatened by a British fleet and army, would force Madison
      to resign or to conclude peace. But on the road to Washington, the
      ambassadors learned to their surprise that General Andrew Jackson had
      decisively repulsed the British before New Orleans, on the 8th of January,
      and on reaching the Capital they were met by the news that a treaty of
      peace had been signed at Ghent. Their cause was not only discredited but
      made ridiculous. They and their mission were forgotten as the tension of
      war times relaxed. The Virginia Dynasty was not to end with James Madison.

      CHAPTER XII. THE PEACEMAKERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      On a May afternoon in the year 1813, a little three-hundred-ton ship, the
      Neptune, put out from New Castle down Delaware Bay. Before she could clear
      the Capes she fell in with a British frigate, one of the blockading
      squadron which was already drawing its fatal cordon around the seaboard
      States. The captain of the Neptune boarded the frigate and presented his
      passport, from which it appeared that he carried two distinguished
      passengers, Albert Gallatin and James A. Bayard, Envoys Extraordinary to
      Russia. The passport duly viseed, the Neptune resumed her course out into
      the open sea, by grace of the British navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these envoys watched the coast disappear in the haze of evening
      with mingled feelings of regret and relief. For twelve weary years
      Gallatin had labored disinterestedly for the land of his adoption and now
      he was recrossing the ocean to the home of his ancestors with the taunts
      of his enemies ringing in his ears. Would the Federalists never forget
      that he was a "foreigner"? He reflected with a sad, ironic smile that as a
      "foreigner with a French accent" he would have distinct advantages in the
      world of European diplomacy upon which he was entering. He counted many
      distinguished personages among his friends, from Madame de Stael to
      Alexander Baring of the famous London banking house. Unlike many native
      Americans he did not need to learn the ways of European courts, because he
      was to the manner born: he had no provincial habits which he must slough
      off or conceal. Also he knew himself and the happy qualities with which
      Nature had endowed him&mdash;patience, philosophic composure, unfailing
      good humor. All these qualities were to be laid under heavy requisition in
      the work ahead of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      James Bayard, Gallatin's fellow passenger, had never been taunted as a
      foreigner, because several generations had intervened since the first of
      his family had come to New Amsterdam with Peter Stuyvesant. Nothing but
      his name could ever suggest that he was not of that stock commonly
      referred to as native American. Bayard had graduated at Princeton, studied
      law in Philadelphia, and had just opened a law office in Wilmington when
      he was elected to represent Delaware in Congress. As the sole
      representative of his State in the House of Representatives and as a
      Federalist, he had exerted a powerful influence in the disputed election
      of 1800, and he was credited with having finally made possible the
      election of Jefferson over Burr. Subsequently he was sent to the Senate,
      where he was serving when he was asked by President Madison to accompany
      Gallatin on this mission to the court of the Czar. Granting that a
      Federalist must be selected, Gallatin could not have found a colleague
      more to his liking, for Bayard was a good companion and perhaps the least
      partisan of the Federalist leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midsummer when the Neptune dropped anchor in the harbor of
      Kronstadt. There Gallatin and Bayard were joined by John Quincy Adams,
      Minister to Russia, who had been appointed the third member of the
      commission. Here was a pureblooded American by all the accepted canons.
      John Quincy Adams was the son of his father and gloried secretly in his
      lineage: a Puritan of the Puritans in his outlook upon human life and
      destiny. Something of the rigid quality of rock-bound New England entered
      into his composition. He was a foe to all compromise&mdash;even with
      himself; to him Duty was the stern daughter of the voice of God, who
      admonished him daily and hourly of his obligations. No character in
      American public life has unbosomed himself so completely as this son of
      Massachusetts in the pages of his diary. There are no half tones in the
      pictures which he has drawn of himself, no winsome graces of mind or
      heart, only the rigid outlines of a soul buffeted by Destiny. Gallatin&mdash;the
      urbane, cosmopolitan Gallatin&mdash;must have derived much quiet amusement
      from his association with this robust New Englander who took himself so
      seriously. Two natures could not have been more unlike, yet the superior
      flexibility of Gallatin's temperament made their association not only
      possible but exceedingly profitable. We may not call their intimacy a
      friendship&mdash;Adams had few, if any friendships; but it contained the
      essential foundation for friendship&mdash;complete mutual confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adams brought disheartening news to the travel-weary passengers on the
      Neptune: England had declined the offer of mediation. Yes; he had the
      information from the lips of Count Roumanzoff, the Chancellor and Minister
      of Foreign Affairs. Apparently, said Adams with pursed lips, England
      regarded the differences with America as a sort of family quarrel in which
      it would not allow an outside neutral nation to interfere. Roumanzoff,
      however, had renewed the offer of mediation. What the motives of the Count
      were, he would not presume to say: Russian diplomacy was unfathomable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American commissioners were in a most embarrassing position. Courtesy
      required that they should make no move until they knew what response the
      second offer of mediation would evoke. The Czar was their only friend in
      all Europe, so far as they knew, and they were none too sure of him. They
      were condemned to anxious inactivity, while in middle Europe the fortunes
      of the Czar rose and fell. In August the combined armies of Russia,
      Austria, and Prussia were beaten by the fresh levies of Napoleon; in
      September, the fighting favored the allies; in October, Napoleon was
      brought to bay on the plains of Leipzig. Yet the imminent fall of the
      Napoleonic Empire only deepened the anxiety of the forlorn American
      envoys, for it was likely to multiply the difficulties of securing
      reasonable terms from his conqueror.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time with news of the Battle of Leipzig came letters from home
      which informed Gallatin that his nomination as envoy had been rejected by
      the Senate. This was the last straw. To remain inactive as an envoy was
      bad enough; to stay on unaccredited seemed impossible. He determined to
      take advantage of a hint dropped by his friend Baring that the British
      Ministry, while declining mediation, was not unwilling to treat directly
      with the American commissioners. He would go to London in an unofficial
      capacity and smooth the way to negotiations. But Adams and Bayard demurred
      and persuaded him to defer his departure. A month later came assurances
      that Lord Castlereagh had offered to negotiate with the Americans either
      at London or at Gothenburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in January, 1814, Gallatin and Bayard set off for Amsterdam: the one
      to bide his chance to visit London, the other to await further
      instructions. There they learned that in response to Castlereagh's
      overtures, the President had appointed a new commission, on which
      Gallatin's name did not appear. Notwithstanding this disappointment,
      Gallatin secured the desired permission to visit London through the
      friendly offices of Alexander Baring. Hardly had the Americans established
      themselves in London when word came that the two new commissioners, Henry
      Clay and Jonathan Russell, had landed at Gothenburg bearing a commission
      for Gallatin. It seems that Gallatin was believed to be on his way home
      and had therefore been left off the commission; on learning of his
      whereabouts, the President had immediately added his name. So it happened
      that Gallatin stood last on the list when every consideration dictated his
      choice as head of the commission. The incident illustrates the
      difficulties that beset communication one hundred years ago. Diplomacy was
      a game of chance in which wind and waves often turned the score. Here were
      five American envoys duly accredited, one keeping his stern vigil in
      Russia, two on the coast of Sweden, and two in hostile London. Where would
      they meet? With whom were they to negotiate?
    </p>
    <p>
      After vexatious delays Ghent was fixed upon as the place where peace
      negotiations should begin, and there the Americans rendezvoused during the
      first week in July. Further delay followed, for in spite of the assurances
      of Lord Castlereagh the British representatives did not make their
      appearance for a month. Meantime the American commissioners made
      themselves at home among the hospitable Flemish townspeople, with whom
      they became prime favorites. In the concert halls they were always greeted
      with enthusiasm. The musicians soon discovered that British tunes were not
      in favor and endeavored to learn some American airs. Had the Americans no
      national airs of their own, they asked. "Oh, yes!" they were assured.
      "There was Hail Columbia." Would not one of the gentlemen be good enough
      to play or sing it? An embarrassing request, for musical talent was not
      conspicuous in the delegation; but Peter, Gallatin's black servant, rose
      to the occasion. He whistled the air; and then one of the attaches scraped
      out the melody on a fiddle, so that the quick-witted orchestra speedily
      composed l'air national des Americains a grand orchestre, and thereafter
      always played it as a counterbalance to God save the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diversions of Ghent, however, were not numerous, and time hung heavy
      on the hands of the Americans while they waited for the British
      commissioners. "We dine together at four," Adams records, "and sit usually
      at table until six. We then disperse to our several amusements and
      avocations." Clay preferred cards or billiards and the mild excitement of
      rather high stakes. Gallatin and his young son James preferred the
      theater; and all but Adams became intimately acquainted with the members
      of a French troupe of players whom Adams describes as the worst he ever
      saw. As for Adams himself, his diversion was a solitary walk of two or
      three hours, and then to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 6th of August the British commissioners arrived in Ghent&mdash;Admiral
      Lord Gambier, Henry Goulburn, Esq., and Dr. William Adams. They were not
      an impressive trio. Gambier was an elderly man whom a writer in the
      Morning Chronicle described as a man "who slumbered for some time as a
      Junior Lord of Admiralty; who sung psalms, said prayers, and assisted in
      the burning of Copenhagen, for which he was made a lord." Goulburn was a
      young man who had served as an undersecretary of state. Adams was a doctor
      of laws who was expected perhaps to assist negotiations by his legal lore.
      Gallatin described them not unfairly as "men who have not made any mark,
      puppets of Lords Castlereagh and Liverpool." Perhaps, in justification of
      this choice of representatives, it should be said that the best diplomatic
      talent had been drafted into service at Vienna and that the British
      Ministry expected in this smaller conference to keep the threads of
      diplomacy in its own hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first meeting of the negotiators was amicable enough. The Americans
      found their opponents courteous and well-bred; and both sides evinced a
      desire to avoid in word and manner, as Bayard put it, "everything of an
      inflammable nature." Throughout this memorable meeting at Ghent, indeed,
      even when difficult situations arose and nerves became taut, personal
      relations continued friendly. "We still keep personally upon eating and
      drinking terms with them," Adams wrote at a tense moment. Speaking for his
      superiors and his colleagues, Admiral Gambier assured the Americans of
      their earnest desire to end hostilities on terms honorable to both
      parties. Adams replied that he and his associates reciprocated this
      sentiment. And then, without further formalities, Goulburn stated in blunt
      and business-like fashion the matters on which they had been instructed:
      impressment, fisheries, boundaries, the pacification of the Indians, and
      the demarkation of an Indian territory. The last was to be regarded as a
      sine qua non for the conclusion of any treaty. Would the Americans be good
      enough to state the purport of their instructions?
    </p>
    <p>
      The American commissioners seem to have been startled out of their
      composure by this sine qua non. They had no instructions on this latter
      point nor on the fisheries; they could only ask for a more specific
      statement. What had His Majesty's Government in mind when it referred to
      an Indian territory? With evident reluctance the British commissioners
      admitted that the proposed Indian territory was to serve as a buffer state
      between the United States and Canada. Pressed for more details, they
      intimated that this area thus neutralized might include the entire
      Northwest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second conference only served to show the want of any common basis for
      negotiation. The Americans had come to Ghent to settle two outstanding
      problems&mdash;blockades and indemnities for attacks on neutral commerce&mdash;and
      to insist on the abandonment of impressments as a sine qua non. Both
      commissions then agreed to appeal to their respective Governments for
      further instructions. Within a week, Lord Castlereagh sent precise
      instructions which confirmed the worst fears of the Americans. The Indian
      boundary line was to follow the line of the Treaty of Greenville and
      beyond it neither nation was to acquire land. The United States was asked,
      in short, to set apart for the Indians in perpetuity an area which
      comprised the present States of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois,
      four-fifths of Indiana, and a third of Ohio. But, remonstrated Gallatin,
      this area included States and Territories settled by more than a hundred
      thousand American citizens. What was to be done with them? "They must look
      after themselves," was the blunt answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In comparison with this astounding proposal, Lord Castlereagh's further
      suggestion of a "rectification" of the frontier by the cession of Fort
      Niagara and Sackett's Harbor and by the exclusion of the Americans from
      the Lakes, seemed of little importance. The purpose of His Majesty's
      Government, the commissioners hastened to add, was not aggrandizement but
      the protection of the North American provinces. In view of the avowed aim
      of the United States to conquer Canada, the control of the Lakes must rest
      with Great Britain. Indeed, taking the weakness of Canada into account,
      His Majesty's Government might have reasonably demanded the cession of the
      lands adjacent to the Lakes; and should these moderate terms not be
      accepted, His Majesty's Government would feel itself at liberty to enlarge
      its demands, if the war continued to favor British arms. The American
      commissioners asked if these proposals relating to the control of the
      Lakes were also a sine qua non. "We have given you one sine qua non
      already," was the reply, "and we should suppose one sine qua non at a time
      was enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Americans returned to their hotel of one mind: they could view the
      proposals just made no other light than as a deliberate attempt to
      dismember the United States. They could differ only as to the form in
      which they should couch their positive rejection. As titular head of the
      commission, Adams set promptly to work upon a draft of an answer which he
      soon set before his colleagues. At once all appearance of unanimity
      vanished. To the enemy they could present a united front; in the privacy
      of their apartment, they were five headstrong men. They promptly fell upon
      Adams's draft tooth and nail. Adams described the scene with pardonable
      resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Gallatin is for striking out any expression that may be offensive to
      the feelings of the adverse Party. Mr. Clay is displeased with figurative
      language which he thinks improper for a state paper. Mr. Russell, agreeing
      in the objections of the two other gentlemen, will be further for amending
      the construction of every sentence; and Mr. Bayard, even when agreeing to
      say precisely the same thing, chooses to say it only in his own language."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sharp encounters took place between Adams and Clay. "You dare not,"
      shouted Clay in a passion on one occasion, "you CANNOT, you SHALL not
      insinuate that there has been a cabal of three members against you!"
      "Gentlemen! Gentlemen!" Gallatin would expostulate with a twinkle in his
      eye, "We must remain united or we will fail." It was his good temper and
      tact that saved this and many similar situations. When Bayard had essayed
      a draft of his own and had failed to win support, it was Gallatin who took
      up Adams's draft and put it into acceptable form. On the third day, after
      hours of "sifting, erasing, patching, and amending, until we were all
      wearied, though none of us satisfied," Gallatin's revision was accepted.
      From this moment, Gallatin's virtual leadership was unquestioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The American note of the 24th of August was a vigorous but even-tempered
      protest against the British demands as contrary to precedent and
      dishonorable to the United States. The American States would never consent
      "to abandon territory and a portion of their citizens, to admit a foreign
      interference in their domestic concerns, and to cease to exercise their
      natural rights on their own shores and in their own waters." "A treaty
      concluded on such terms would be but an armistice." But after the note had
      been prepared and dispatched, profound discouragement reigned in the
      American hotel. Even Gallatin, usually hopeful and philosophically serene,
      grew despondent. "Our negotiations may be considered at an end," he wrote
      to Monroe; "Great Britain wants war in order to cripple us. She wants
      aggrandizement at our expense.... I do not expect to be longer than three
      weeks in Europe." The commissioners notified their landlord that they
      would give up their quarters on the 1st of October; yet they lingered on
      week after week, waiting for the word which would close negotiations and
      send them home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the British Ministry was quite as little pleased at the prospect.
      It would not do to let the impression go abroad that Great Britain was
      prepared to continue the war for territorial gains. If a rupture of the
      negotiations must come, Lord Castlereagh preferred to let the Americans
      shoulder the responsibility. He therefore instructed Gambier not to insist
      on the independent Indian territory and the control of the Lakes. These
      points were no longer to be "ultimata" but only matters for discussion.
      The British commissioners were to insist, however, on articles providing
      for the pacification of the Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should the Americans yield this sine qua non, now that the first had been
      withdrawn? Adams thought not, decidedly not; he would rather break off
      negotiations than admit the right of Great Britain to interfere with the
      Indians dwelling within the limits of the United States. Gallatin remarked
      that after all it was a very small point to insist on, when a slight
      concession would win much more important points. "Then, said I [Adams],
      with a movement of impatience and an angry tone, it is a good point to
      admit the British as the sovereigns and protectors of our Indians?
      Gallatin's face brightened, and he said in a tone of perfect good-humor,
      'That's a non-sequitur.' This turned the edge of the argument into
      jocularity. I laughed, and insisted that it was a sequitur, and the
      conversation easily changed to another point." Gallatin had his way with
      the rest of the commission and drafted the note of the 26th of September,
      which, while refusing to recognize the Indians as sovereign nations in the
      treaty, proposed a stipulation that would leave them in possession of
      their former lands and rights. This solution of a perplexing problem was
      finally accepted after another exchange of notes and another earnest
      discussion at the American hotel, where Gallatin again poured oil on the
      troubled waters. Concession begat concession. New instructions from
      President Madison now permitted the commissioners to drop the demand for
      the abolition of impressments and blockades; and, with these difficult
      matters swept away, the path to peace was much easier to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the outlook for peace when news reached Ghent of the humiliating
      rout at Bladensburg. The British newspapers were full of jubilant
      comments; the five crestfallen American envoys took what cold comfort they
      could out of the very general condemnation of the burning of the Capitol.
      Then, on the heels of this intelligence, came rumors that the British
      invasion of New York had failed and that Prevost's army was in full
      retreat to Canada. The Americans could hardly grasp the full significance
      of this British reversal: it was too good to be true. But true it was, and
      their spirits rebounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this juncture that the British commissioners presented a note,
      on the 21st of October, which for the first time went to the heart of the
      negotiations. War had been waged; territory had been overrun; conquests
      had been made&mdash;not the anticipated conquests on either side, to be
      sure, but conquests nevertheless. These were the plain facts. Now the
      practical question was this: Was the treaty to be drafted on the basis of
      the existing state of possession or on the basis of the status before the
      war? The British note stated their case in plain unvarnished fashion; it
      insisted on the status uti possidetis&mdash;the possession of territory
      won by arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the minds of the Americans, buoyed up by the victory at Plattsburg,
      there was not the shadow of doubt as to what their answer should be; they
      declined for an instant to consider any other basis for peace than the
      restoration of gains on both sides. Their note was prompt, emphatic, even
      blunt, and it nearly shattered the nerves of the gentlemen in Downing
      Street. Had these stiffnecked Yankees no sense? Could they not perceive
      the studied moderation of the terms proposed&mdash;an island or two and a
      small strip of Maine&mdash;when half of Maine and the south bank of the
      St. Lawrence from Plattsburg to Sackett's Harbor might have been demanded
      as the price of peace?
    </p>
    <p>
      The prospect of another year of war simply to secure a frontier which nine
      out of ten Englishmen could not have identified was most disquieting,
      especially in view of the prodigious cost of military operations in North
      America. The Ministry was both hot and cold. At one moment it favored
      continued war; at another it shrank from the consequences; and in the end
      it confessed its own want of decision by appealing to the Duke of
      Wellington and trying to shift the responsibility to his broad shoulders.
      Would the Duke take command of the forces in Canada? He should be invested
      with full diplomatic and military powers to bring the war to an honorable
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply of the Iron Duke gave the Ministry another shock. He would go to
      America, but he did not promise himself much success there, and he was
      reluctant to leave Europe at this critical time. To speak frankly, he had
      no high opinion of the diplomatic game which the Ministry was playing at
      Ghent. "I confess," said he, "that I think you have no right from the
      state of the war to demand any concession from America... You have not
      been able to carry it into the enemy's territory, notwithstanding your
      military success, and now undoubted military superiority, and have not
      even cleared your own territory on the point of attack. You cannot on any
      principle of equality in negotiation claim a cession of territory
      excepting in exchange for other advantages which you have in your
      power.... Then if this reasoning be true, why stipulate for the uti
      possidetis? You can get no territory; indeed, the state of your military
      operations, however creditable, does not entitle you to demand any."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Lord Liverpool perused this dispatch, the will to conquer oozed away.
      "I think we have determined," he wrote a few days later to Castlereagh,
      "if all other points can be satisfactorily settled, not to continue the
      war for the purpose of obtaining or securing any acquisition of
      territory." He set forth his reasons for this decision succinctly: the
      unsatisfactory state of the negotiations at Vienna, the alarming condition
      of France, the deplorable financial outlook in England. But Lord Liverpool
      omitted to mention a still more potent factor in his calculations&mdash;the
      growing impatience of the country. The American war had ceased to be
      popular; it had become the graveyard of military reputations; it promised
      no glory to either sailor or soldier. Now that the correspondence of the
      negotiators at Ghent was made public, the reading public might very easily
      draw the conclusion that the Ministry was prolonging the war by setting up
      pretensions which it could not sustain. No Ministry could afford to
      continue a war out of mere stubbornness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, wholly in the dark as to the forces which were working in their
      favor, the American commissioners set to work upon a draft of a treaty
      which should be their answer to the British offer of peace on the basis of
      uti possidetis. Almost at once dissensions occurred. Protracted
      negotiations and enforced idleness had set their nerves on edge, and old
      personal and sectional differences appeared. The two matters which caused
      most trouble were the fisheries and the navigation of the Mississippi.
      Adams could not forget how stubbornly his father had fought for that
      article in the treaty of 1783 which had conceded to New England fishermen,
      as a natural right, freedom to fish in British waters. To a certain extent
      this concession had been offset by yielding to the British the right of
      navigation of the Mississippi, but the latter right seemed unimportant in
      the days when the Alleghanies marked the limit of western settlement. In
      the quarter of a century which had elapsed, however, the West had come
      into its own. It was now a powerful section with an intensely alert
      consciousness of its rights and wrongs; and among its rights it counted
      the exclusive control of the Father of Waters. Feeling himself as much the
      champion of Western interests as Adams did of New England fisheries, Clay
      refused indignantly to consent to a renewal of the treaty provisions of
      1783. But when the matter came to a vote, he found himself with Russell in
      a minority. Very reluctantly he then agreed to Gallatin's proposal, to
      insert in a note, rather than in the draft itself, a paragraph to the
      effect that the commissioners were not instructed to discuss the rights
      hitherto enjoyed in the fisheries, since no further stipulation was deemed
      necessary to entitle them to rights which were recognized by the treaty of
      1783.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the British reply to the American project was read, Adams noted with
      quiet satisfaction that the reservation as to the fisheries was passed
      over in silence&mdash;silence, he thought, gave consent&mdash;but Clay
      flew into a towering passion when he learned that the old right of
      navigating the Mississippi was reasserted. Adams was prepared to accept
      the British proposals; Clay refused point blank; and Gallatin sided this
      time with Clay. Could a compromise be effected between these stubborn
      representatives of East and West? Gallatin tried once more. Why not accept
      the British right of navigation&mdash;surely an unimportant point after
      all&mdash;and ask for an express affirmation of fishery rights? Clay
      replied hotly that if they were going to sacrifice the West to
      Massachusetts, he would not sign the treaty. With infinite patience
      Gallatin continued to play the role of peacemaker and finally brought both
      these self-willed men to agree to offer a renewal of both rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of accepting this eminently fair adjustment, the British
      representatives proposed that the two disputed rights be left to future
      negotiation. The suggestion caused another explosion in the ranks of the
      Americans. Adams would not admit even by implication that the rights for
      which his sire fought could be forfeited by war and become the subject of
      negotiation. But all save Adams were ready to yield. Again Gallatin came
      to the rescue. He penned a note rejecting the British offer, because it
      seemed to imply the abandonment of a right; but in turn he offered to omit
      in the treaty all reference to the fisheries and the Mississippi or to
      include a general reference to further negotiation of all matters still in
      dispute, in such a way as not to relinquish any rights. To this solution
      of the difficulty all agreed, though Adams was still torn by doubts and
      Clay believed that the treaty was bound to be "damned bad" anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      An anxious week of waiting followed. On the 22d of December came the
      British reply&mdash;a grudging acceptance of Gallatin's first proposal to
      omit all reference to the fisheries and the Mississippi. Two days later
      the treaty was signed in the refectory of the Carthusian monastery where
      the British commissioners were quartered. Let the tired seventeen-year-old
      boy who had been his father's scribe through these long weary months
      describe the events of Christmas Day, 1814. "The British delegates very
      civilly asked us to dinner," wrote James Gallatin in his diary. "The roast
      beef and plum pudding was from England, and everybody drank everybody
      else's health. The band played first God Save the King, to the toast of
      the King, and Yankee Doodle, to the toast of the President.
      Congratulations on all sides and a general atmosphere of serenity; it was
      a scene to be remembered. God grant there may be always peace between the
      two nations. I never saw father so cheerful; he was in high spirits, and
      his witty conversation was much appreciated." *

    <p>
      Peace! That was the outstanding achievement of the American commissioners
      at Ghent. Measured by the purposes of the war-hawks of 1812, measured by
      the more temperate purposes of President Madison, the Treaty of Ghent was
      a confession of national weakness and humiliating failure. Clay, whose
      voice had been loudest for war and whose kindling fancy had pictured
      American armies dictating terms of surrender at Quebec, set his signature
      to a document which redressed not a single grievance and added not a foot
      of territory to the United States. Adams, who had denounced Great Britain
      for the crime of "man-stealing," accepted a treaty of peace which
      contained not a syllable about impressment. President Madison, who had
      reluctantly accepted war as the last means of escape from the blockade of
      American ports and the ruin of neutral trade, recommended the ratification
      of a convention which did not so much as mention maritime questions and
      the rights of neutrals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace&mdash;and nothing more? Much more, indeed, than appears in rubrics
      on parchment. The Treaty of Ghent must be interpreted in the light of more
      than a hundred years of peace between the two great branches of the
      English-speaking race. More conscious of their differences than anything
      else, no doubt, these eight peacemakers at Ghent nevertheless spoke a
      common tongue and shared a common English trait: they laid firm hold on
      realities. Like practical men they faced the year 1815 and not 1812. In a
      pacified Europe rid of the Corsican, questions of maritime practice seemed
      dead issues. Let the dead past bury its dead! To remove possible causes of
      future controversy seemed wiser statesmanship than to rake over the embers
      of quarrels which might never be rekindled. So it was that in prosaic
      articles they provided for three commissions to arbitrate boundary
      controversies at critical points in the far-flung frontier between Canada
      and the United States, and thus laid the foundations of an international
      accord which has survived a hundred years.

      CHAPTER XIII. SPANISH DERELICTS IN THE NEW WORLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      It fell to the last, and perhaps least talented, President of the Virginia
      Dynasty to consummate the work of Jefferson and Madison by a final
      settlement with Spain which left the United States in possession of the
      Floridas. In the diplomatic service James Monroe had exhibited none of
      those qualities which warranted the expectation that he would succeed
      where his predecessors had failed. On his missions to England and Spain,
      indeed, he had been singularly inept, but he had learned much in the rude
      school of experience, and he now brought to his new duties discretion,
      sobriety, and poise. He was what the common people held him to be a
      faithful public servant, deeply and sincerely republican, earnestly
      desirous to serve the country which he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances of Monroe's election pledged him to a truly national
      policy. He had received the electoral votes of all but three States. * He
      was now President of an undivided country, not merely a Virginian
      fortuitously elevated to the chief magistracy and regarded as alien in
      sympathy to the North and East. Any doubts on this point were dispelled by
      the popular demonstrations which greeted him on his tour through
      Federalist strongholds in the Northeast. "I have seen enough," he wrote in
      grateful recollection, "to satisfy me that the great mass of our
      fellow-citizens in the Eastern States are as firmly attached to the union
      and republican government as I have always believed or could desire them
      to be." The news-sheets which followed his progress from day to day coined
      the phrase, "era of good feeling," which has passed current ever since as
      a characterization of his administration.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Monroe received 183 electoral votes and Rufus King, 34&mdash;
     the votes of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was in this admirable temper and with this broad national outlook that
      Monroe chose his advisers and heads of departments. He was well aware of
      the common belief that his predecessors had appointed Virginians to the
      Secretaryship of State in order to prepare the way for their succession to
      the Presidency. He was determined, therefore, to avert the suspicion of
      sectional bias by selecting some one from the Eastern States, rather than
      from the South or from the West, hitherto so closely allied to the South.
      His choice fell upon John Quincy Adams, "who by his age, long experience
      in our foreign affairs, and adoption into the Republican party," he
      assured Jefferson, "seems to have superior pretentions." It was an
      excellent appointment from every point of view but one. Monroe had
      overlooked&mdash;and the circumstance did him infinite credit&mdash;the
      exigencies of politics and passed over an individual whose vaulting
      ambition had already made him an aspirant to the Presidency. Henry Clay
      was grievously disappointed and henceforward sulked in his tent, refusing
      the Secretaryship of War which the President tendered. Eventually the
      brilliant young John C. Calhoun took this post. This South Carolinian was
      in the prime of life, full of fire and dash, ardently patriotic, and
      nationally-minded to an unusual degree. Of William H. Crawford of Georgia,
      who retained the Secretaryship of the Treasury, little need be said except
      that he also was a presidential aspirant who saw things always from the
      angle of political expediency. Benjamin W. Crowninshield as Secretary of
      the Navy and William Wirt as Attorney-General completed the circle of the
      President's intimate advisers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new Secretary of State had not been in office many weeks before he
      received a morning call from Don Luis de Onis, the Spanish Minister, who
      was laboring under ill-disguised excitement. It appeared that his house in
      Washington had been repeatedly "insulted" of late-windows broken, lamps in
      front of the house smashed, and one night a dead fowl tied to his
      bell-rope. This last piece of vandalism had been too much for his
      equanimity. He held it a gross insult to his sovereign and the Spanish
      monarchy, importing that they were of no more consequence than a dead old
      hen! Adams, though considerably amused, endeavored to smooth the ruffled
      pride of the chevalier by suggesting that these were probably only the
      tricks of some mischievous boys; but De Onis was not easily appeased.
      Indeed, as Adams was himself soon to learn, the American public did regard
      the Spanish monarchy as a dead old hen, and took no pains to disguise its
      contempt. Adams had yet to learn the long train of circumstances which
      made Spanish relations the most delicate and difficult of all the
      diplomatic problems in his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his wonted industry, Adams soon made himself master of the facts
      relating to Spanish diplomacy. For the moment interest centered on East
      Florida. Carefully unraveling the tangled skein of events, Adams followed
      the thread which led back to President Madison's secret message to
      Congress of January 3,1811, which was indeed one of the landmarks in
      American policy. Madison had recommended a declaration "that the United
      States could not see without serious inquietude any part of a neighboring
      territory [like East Florida] in which they have in different respects so
      deep and so just a concern pass from the hands of Spain into those of any
      other foreign power." To prevent the possible subversion of Spanish
      authority in East Florida and the occupation of the province by a foreign
      power&mdash;Great Britain was, of course, the power the President had in
      mind&mdash;he had urged Congress to authorize him to take temporary
      possession "in pursuance of arrangements which may be desired by the
      Spanish authorities." Congress had responded with alacrity and empowered
      the President to occupy East Florida in case the local authorities should
      consent or a foreign power should attempt to occupy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With equal dispatch the President had sent two agents, General George
      Matthews and Colonel John McKee, on one of the strangest missions in the
      border history of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      East Florida&mdash;Adams found, pursuing his inquiries into the archives
      of the department&mdash;included the two important ports of entry,
      Pensacola on the Gulf and Fernandina on Amelia Island, at the mouth of the
      St. Mary's River. The island had long been a notorious resort for
      smugglers. Hither had come British and American vessels with cargoes of
      merchandise and slaves, which found their way in mysterious fashion to
      consignees within the States. A Spanish garrison of ten men was the sole
      custodian of law and order on the island. Up and down the river was
      scattered a lawless population of freebooters, who were equally ready to
      raid a border plantation or to raise the Jolly Roger on some piratical
      cruise. To this No Man's Land&mdash;fertile recruiting ground for all
      manner of filibustering expeditions&mdash;General Matthews and Colonel
      McKee had betaken themselves in the spring of 1811, bearing some explicit
      instructions from President Madison but also some very pronounced
      convictions as to what they were expected to accomplish. Matthews, at
      least, understood that the President wished a revolution after the West
      Florida model. He assured the Administration-Adams read the precious
      missive in the files of his office-that he could do the trick. Only let
      the Government consign two hundred stand of arms and fifty horsemen's
      swords to the commander at St. Mary's, and he would guarantee to put the
      revolution through without committing the United States in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melodrama had been staged for the following spring (1812). Some two
      hundred "patriots" recruited from the border people gathered near St.
      Mary's with souls yearning for freedom; and while American gunboats took a
      menacing position, this force of insurgents had landed on Amelia Island
      and summoned the Spanish commandant to surrender. Not willing to spoil the
      scene by vulgar resistance, the commandant capitulated and marched out his
      garrison, ten strong, with all the honors of war. The Spanish flag had
      been hauled down to give place to the flag of the insurgents, bearing the
      inspiring motto Salus populi&mdash;suprema lex. Then General Matthews with
      a squad of regular United States troops had crossed the river and taken
      possession. Only the benediction of the Government at Washington was
      lacking to make the success of his mission complete; but to the general's
      consternation no approving message came, only a peremptory dispatch
      disavowing his acts and revoking his commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Adams reviewed these events, he could see no other alternative for the
      Government to have pursued at this moment when war with Great Britain was
      impending. It would have been the height of folly to break openly with
      Spain. The Administration had indeed instructed its new agent, Governor
      Mitchell of Georgia, to restore the island to the Spanish commandant and
      to withdraw his troops, if he could do so without sacrificing the
      insurgents to the vengeance of the Spaniards. But the forces set in motion
      by Matthews were not so easily controlled from Washington. Once having
      resolved to liberate East Florida, the patriots were not disposed to
      retire at the nod of the Secretary of State. The Spanish commandant was
      equally obdurate. He would make no promise to spare the insurgents. The
      Legislature of Georgia, too, had a mind of its own. It resolved that the
      occupation of East Florida was essential to the safety of the State,
      whether Congress approved or no; and the Governor, swept along in the
      current of popular feeling, summoned troops from Savannah to hold the
      province. Just at this moment had come the news of war with Great Britain;
      and Governor, State militia, and patriots had combined in an effort to
      prevent East Florida from becoming enemy's territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Military considerations had also swept the Administration along the same
      hazardous course. The occupation of the Floridas seemed imperative. The
      President sought authorization from Congress to occupy and govern both the
      Floridas until the vexed question of title could be settled by
      negotiation. Only a part of this programme had carried, for, while
      Congress was prepared to approve the military occupation of West Florida
      to the Perdido River, beyond that it would not go; and so with great
      reluctance the President had ordered the troops to withdraw from Amelia
      Island. In the spring of the same year (1813) General Wilkinson had
      occupied West Florida&mdash;the only permanent conquest of the war and
      that, oddly enough, the conquest of a territory owned and held by a power
      with which the United States was not at war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abandoned by the American troops, Amelia Island had become a rendezvous
      for outlaws from every part of the Americas. Just about the time that
      Adams was crossing the ocean to take up his duties at the State
      Department, one of these buccaneers by the name of Gregor MacGregor
      descended upon the island as "Brigadier General of the Armies of the
      United Provinces of New Granada and Venezuela, and General-in-chief of
      that destined to emancipate the provinces of both Floridas, under the
      commission of the Supreme Government of Mexico and South America." This
      pirate was soon succeeded by General Aury, who had enjoyed a wild career
      among the buccaneers of Galveston Bay, where he had posed as military
      governor under the Republic of Mexico. East Florida in the hands of such
      desperadoes was a menace to the American border. Approaching the problem
      of East Florida without any of the prepossessions of those who had been
      dealing with Spanish envoys for a score of years, the new Secretary of
      State was prepared to move directly to his goal without any too great
      consideration for the feelings of others. His examination of the facts led
      him to a clean-cut decision: this nest of pirates must be broken up at
      once. His energy carried President and Cabinet along with him. It was
      decided to send troops and ships to the St. Mary's and if necessary to
      invest Fernandina. This demonstration of force sufficed; General Aury
      departed to conquer new worlds, and Amelia Island was occupied for the
      second time without bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, having grasped the nettle firmly, what was the Administration to
      do with it? De Onis promptly registered his protest; the opposition in
      Congress seized upon the incident to worry the President; many of the
      President's friends thought that he had been precipitate. Monroe, indeed,
      would have been glad to withdraw the troops now that they had effected
      their object, but Adams was for holding the island in order to force Spain
      to terms. With a frankness which lacerated the feelings of De Onis, Adams
      insisted that the United States had acted strictly on the defensive. The
      occupation of Amelia Island was not an act of aggression but a necessary
      measure for the protection of commerce&mdash;American commerce, the
      commerce of other nations, the commerce of Spain itself. Now why not put
      an end to all friction by ceding the Floridas to the United States? What
      would Spain take for all her possessions east of the Mississippi, Adams
      asked. De Onis declined to say. Well, then, Adams pursued, suppose the
      United States should withdraw from Amelia Island, would Spain guarantee
      that it should not be occupied again by free-booters? No: De Onis could
      give no such guarantee, but he would write to the Governor of Havana to
      ascertain if he would send an adequate garrison to Fernandina. Adams
      reported this significant conversation to the President, who was visibly
      shaken by the conflict of opinions within his political household and not
      a little alarmed at the possibility of war with Spain. The Secretary of
      State was coolly taking the measure of his chief. "There is a slowness,
      want of decision, and a spirit of procrastination in the President," he
      confided to his diary. He did not add, but the thought was in his mind,
      that he could sway this President, mold him to his heart's desire. In this
      first trial of strength the hardier personality won: Monroe sent a message
      to Congress, on January 13, 1818, announcing his intention to hold East
      Florida for the present, and the arguments which he used to justify this
      bold course were precisely those of his Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Adams suggested that Spain might put an end to all her worries by
      ceding the Floridas, he was only renewing an offer that Monroe had made
      while he was still Secretary of State. De Onis had then declared that
      Spain would never cede territory east of the Mississippi unless the United
      States would relinquish its claims west of that river. Now, to the new
      Secretary, De Onis intimated that he was ready to be less exacting. He
      would be willing to run the line farther west and allow the United States
      a large part of what is now the State of Louisiana. Adams made no reply to
      this tentative proposal but bided his time; and time played into his hands
      in unexpected ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Secretary's office, one day in June, 1818, came a letter from De
      Onis which was a veritable firebrand. De Onis, who was not unnaturally
      disposed to believe the worst of Americans on the border, had heard that
      General Andrew Jackson in pursuit of the Seminole Indians had crossed into
      Florida and captured Pensacola and St. Mark's. He demanded to be informed
      "in a positive, distinct and explicit manner just what had occurred"; and
      then, outraged by confirmatory reports and without waiting for Adams's
      reply, he wrote another angry letter, insisting upon the restitution of
      the captured forts and the punishment of the American general. Worse
      tidings followed. Bagot, the British Minister, had heard that Jackson had
      seized and executed two British subjects on Spanish soil. Would the
      Secretary of State inform him whether General Jackson had been authorized
      to take Pensacola, and would the Secretary furnish him with copies of the
      reports of the courts-martial which had condemned these two subjects of
      His Majesty? Adams could only reply that he lacked official information.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the second week in July, dispatches from General Jackson confirmed the
      worst insinuations and accusations of De Onis and Bagot. President Monroe
      was painfully embarrassed. Prompt disavowal of the general's conduct
      seemed the only way to avert war; but to disavow the acts of this popular
      idol, the victor of New Orleans, was no light matter. He sought the advice
      of his Cabinet and was hardly less embarrassed to find all but one
      convinced that "Old Hickory" had acted contrary to instructions and had
      committed acts of hostility against Spain. A week of anxious Cabinet
      sessions followed, in which only one voice was raised in defense of the
      invasion of Florida. All but Adams feared war, a war which the opposition
      would surely brand as incited by the President without the consent of
      Congress. No administration could carry on a war begun in violation of the
      Constitution, said Calhoun. But, argued Adams, the President may authorize
      defensive acts of hostility. Jackson had been authorized to cross the
      frontier, if necessary, in pursuit of the Indians, and all the ensuing
      deplorable incidents had followed as a necessary consequence of Indian
      warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conclusions of the Cabinet were summed up by Adams in a reply to De
      Onis, on the 23d of July, which must have greatly astonished that diligent
      defender of Spanish honor. Opening the letter to read, as he confidently
      expected, a disavowal and an offer of reparation, he found the
      responsibility for the recent unpleasant incidents fastened upon his own
      country. He was reminded that by the treaty of 1795 both Governments had
      contracted to restrain the Indians within their respective borders, so
      that neither should suffer from hostile raids, and that the Governor of
      Pensacola, when called upon to break up a stronghold of Indians and
      fugitive slaves, had acknowledged his obligation but had pleaded his
      inability to carry out the covenant. Then, and then only, had General
      Jackson been authorized to cross the border and to put an end to outrages
      which the Spanish authorities lacked the power to prevent. General Jackson
      had taken possession of the Spanish forts on his own responsibility when
      he became convinced of the duplicity of the commandant, who, indeed, had
      made himself "a partner and accomplice of the hostile Indians and of their
      foreign instigators." Such conduct on the part of His Majesty's officer
      justified the President in calling for his punishment. But, in the
      meantime, the President was prepared to restore Pensacola, and also St.
      Mark's, whenever His Majesty should send a force sufficiently strong to
      hold the Indians under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the Secretary of State moderate his tone or abate his demands when
      Pizarro, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, threatened to suspend
      negotiations with the United States until it should give satisfaction for
      this "shameful invasion of His Majesty's territory" and for these "acts of
      barbarity glossed over with the forms of justice." In a dispatch to the
      American Minister at Madrid, Adams vigorously defended Jackson's conduct
      from beginning to end. The time had come, said he, when "Spain must
      immediately make her election either to place a force in Florida adequate
      at once to the protection of her territory and to the fulfilment of her
      engagements or cede to the United States a province of which she retains
      nothing but the nominal possession, but which is in fact a derelict, open
      to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States
      and serving no other earthly purpose, than as a post of annoyance to
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      This affront to Spanish pride might have ended abruptly a chapter in
      Spanish-American diplomacy but for the friendly offices of Hyde de
      Neuville, the French Minister at Washington, whose Government could not
      view without alarm the possibility of a rupture between the two countries.
      It was Neuville who labored through the summer months of this year, first
      with Adams, then with De Onis, tempering the demands of the one and
      placating the pride of the other, but never allowing intercourse to drop.
      Adams was right, and both Neuville and De Onis knew it; the only way to
      settle outstanding differences was to cede these Spanish derelicts in the
      New World to the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring and keep together these two antithetical personalities,
      representatives of two opposing political systems, was no small
      achievement. What De Onis thought of his stubborn opponent may be
      surmised; what the American thought of the Spaniard need not be left to
      conjecture. In the pages of his diary Adams painted the portrait of his
      adversary as he saw him&mdash;"cold, calculating, wily, always commanding
      his temper, proud because he is a Spaniard but supple and cunning,
      accommodating the tone of his pretensions precisely to the degree of
      endurance of his opponents, bold and overbearing to the utmost extent to
      which it is tolerated, careless of what he asserts or how grossly it is
      proved to be unfounded."
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the negotiations running through the fall and winter is a
      succession of propositions and counter-propositions, made formally by the
      chief participants or tentatively and informally through Neuville. The
      western boundary of the Louisiana purchase was the chief obstacle to
      agreement. Each sparred for an advantage; each made extreme claims; and
      each was persuaded to yield a little here and a little there, slowly
      narrowing the bounds of the disputed territory. More than once the
      President and the Cabinet believed that the last concession had been
      extorted and were prepared to yield on other matters. When the President
      was prepared, for example, to accept the hundredth meridian and the
      forty-third parallel, Adams insisted on demanding the one hundred and
      second and the forty-second; and "after a long and violent struggle,"
      wrote Adams, "he [De Onis]. .. agreed to take longitude one hundred from
      the Red River to the Arkansas, and latitude forty-two from the source of
      the Arkansas to the South Sea." This was a momentous decision, for the
      United States acquired thus whatever claim Spain had to the northwest
      coast but sacrificed its claim to Texas for the possession of the
      Floridas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vexatious questions still remained to be settled. The spoliation claims
      which were to have been adjusted by the convention of 1802 were finally
      left to a commission, the United States agreeing to assume all obligations
      to an amount not exceeding five million dollars. De Onis demurred at
      stating this amount in the treaty: he would be blamed for having betrayed
      the honor of Spain by selling the Floridas for a paltry five millions. To
      which Adams replied dryly that he ought to boast of his bargain instead of
      being ashamed of it, since it was notorious that the Floridas had always
      been a burden to the Spanish exchequer. Negotiations came to a standstill
      again when Adams insisted that certain royal grants of land in the
      Floridas should be declared null and void. He feared, and not without
      reason, that these grants would deprive the United States of the domain
      which was to be used to pay the indemnities assumed in the treaty. De Onis
      resented the demand as "offensive to the dignity and imprescriptible
      rights of the Crown of Spain"; and once again Neuville came to the rescue
      of the treaty and persuaded both parties to agree to a compromise. On the
      understanding that the royal grants in question had been made subsequent
      to January 24, 1818, Adams agreed that all grants made since that date
      (when the first proposal was made by His Majesty for the cession of the
      Floridas) should be declared null and void; and that all grants made
      before that date should be confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the anniversary of Washington's birthday, De Onis and Adams signed the
      treaty which carried the United States to its natural limits on the
      southeast. The event seemed to Adams to mark "a great epocha in our
      history." "It was near one in the morning," he recorded in his diary,
      "when I closed the day with ejaculations of fervent gratitude to the Giver
      of all good. It was, perhaps, the most important day of my life.... Let no
      idle and unfounded exultation take possession of my mind, as if I would
      ascribe to my own foresight or exertions any portion of the event." But
      misgivings followed hard on these joyous reflections. The treaty had still
      to be ratified, and the disposition of the Spanish Cortes was uncertain.
      There was, too, considerable opposition in the Senate. "A watchful eye, a
      resolute purpose, a calm and patient temper, and a favoring Providence
      will all be as indispensable for the future as they have been for the past
      in the management of this negotiation," Adams reminded himself. He had
      need of all these qualities in the trying months that followed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. FRAMING AN AMERICAN POLICY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The decline and fall of the Spanish Empire does not challenge the
      imagination like the decline and fall of that other Empire with which
      alone it can be compared, possibly because no Gibbon has chronicled its
      greatness. Yet its dissolution affected profoundly the history of three
      continents. While the Floridas were slipping from the grasp of Spain, the
      provinces to the south were wrenching themselves loose, with protestations
      which penetrated to European chancelleries as well as to American
      legislative halls. To Czar Alexander and Prince Metternich, sponsors for
      the Holy Alliance and preservers of the peace of Europe, these
      declarations of independence contained the same insidious philosophy of
      revolution which they had pledged themselves everywhere to combat. To
      simple American minds, the familiar words liberty and independence in the
      mouths of South American patriots meant what they had to their own
      grandsires, struggling to throw off the shackles of British imperial
      control. Neither Europe nor America, however, knew the actual conditions
      in these newborn republics below the equator; and both governed their
      conduct by their prepossessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the typically American mind of Henry Clay, now untrammeled by any sense
      of responsibility, for he was a free lance in the House of Representatives
      once more, the emancipation of South America was a thrilling and sublime
      spectacle&mdash;"the glorious spectacle of eighteen millions of people
      struggling to burst their chains and to be free." In a memorable speech in
      1818 he had expressed the firm conviction that there could be but one
      outcome to this struggle. Independent these South American states would
      be. Equally clear to his mind was their political destiny. Whatever their
      forms of government, they would be animated by an American feeling and
      guided by an American policy. "They will obey the laws of the system of
      the new world, of which they will compose a part, in contradistinction to
      that of Europe." To this struggle and to this destiny the United States
      could not remain indifferent. He would not have the Administration depart
      from its policy of strict and impartial neutrality but he would urge the
      expediency&mdash;nay, the justice&mdash;of recognizing established
      governments in Spanish America. Such recognition was not a breach of
      neutrality, for it did not imply material aid in the wars of liberation
      but only the moral sympathy of a great free people for their southern
      brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrasted with Clay's glowing enthusiasm, the attitude of the
      Administration, directed by the prudent Secretary of State, seemed cold,
      calculating, and rigidly conventional. For his part, Adams could see
      little resemblance between these revolutions in South America and that of
      1776. Certainly it had never been disgraced by such acts of buccaneering
      and piracy as were of everyday occurrence in South American waters. The
      United States had contended for civil rights and then for independence; in
      South America civil rights had been ignored by all parties. He could
      discern neither unity of cause nor unity of effort in the confused history
      of recent struggles in South America; and until orderly government was
      achieved, with due regard to fundamental civil rights, he would not have
      the United States swerve in the slightest degree from the path of strict
      neutrality. Mr. Clay, he observed in his diary, had "mounted his South
      American great horse... to control or overthrow the executive."
    </p>
    <p>
      President Monroe, however, was more impressionable, more responsive to
      popular opinion, and at this moment (as the presidential year approached)
      more desirous to placate the opposition. He agreed with Adams that the
      moment had not come when the United States alone might safely recognize
      the South American states, but he believed that concerted action by the
      United States and Great Britain might win recognition without wounding the
      sensibilities of Spain. The time was surely not far distant when Spain
      would welcome recognition as a relief from an impoverishing and hopeless
      war. Meanwhile the President coupled professions of neutrality and
      expressions of sympathy for the revolutionists in every message to
      Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The temporizing policy of the Administration aroused Clay to another
      impassioned plea for those southern brethren whose hearts&mdash;despite
      all rebuffs from the Department of State&mdash;still turned toward the
      United States. "We should become the center of a system which would
      constitute the rallying point of human freedom against the despotism of
      the Old World.... Why not proceed to act on our own responsibility and
      recognize these governments as independent, instead of taking the lead of
      the Holy Alliance in a course which jeopardizes the happiness of unborn
      millions?" He deprecated this deference to foreign powers. "If Lord
      Castlereagh says we may recognize, we do; if not, we do not.... Our
      institutions now make us free; but how long shall we continue so, if we
      mold our opinions on those of Europe? Let us break these commercial and
      political fetters; let us no longer watch the nod of any European
      politician; let us become real and true Americans, and place ourselves at
      the head of the American system."
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of recognition was thus thrust into the foreground of
      discussion at a most inopportune time. The Florida treaty had not yet been
      ratified, for reasons best known to His Majesty the King of Spain, and the
      new Spanish Minister, General Vives, had just arrived in the United States
      to ask for certain explanations. The Administration had every reason at
      this moment to wish to avoid further causes of irritation to Spanish
      pride. It is more than probable, indeed, that Clay was not unwilling to
      embarrass the President and his Secretary of State. He still nursed his
      personal grudge against the President and he did not disguise his
      hostility to the treaty. What aroused his resentment was the sacrifice of
      Texas for Florida. Florida would have fallen to the United States
      eventually like ripened fruit, he believed. Why, then, yield an
      incomparably richer and greater territory for that which was bound to
      become theirs whenever the American people wished to take it?
    </p>
    <p>
      But what were the explanations which Vives demanded? Weary hours spent in
      conference with the wily Spaniard convinced Adams that the great obstacle
      to the ratification of the treaty by Spain had been the conviction that
      the United States was only waiting ratification to recognize the
      independence of the Spanish colonies. Bitterly did Adams regret the
      advances which he had made to Great Britain, at the instance of the
      President, and still more bitterly did he deplore those paragraphs in the
      President's messages which had expressed an all too ready sympathy with
      the aims of the insurgents. But regrets availed nothing and the Secretary
      of State had to put the best face possible on the policy of the
      Administration. He told Vives in unmistakable language that the United
      States could not subscribe to "new engagements as the price of obtaining
      the ratification of the old." Certainly the United States would not comply
      with the Spanish demand and pledge itself "to form no relations with the
      pretended governments of the revolted provinces of Spain." As for the
      royal grants which De Onis had agreed to call null and void, if His
      Majesty insisted upon their validity, perhaps the United States might
      acquiesce for an equivalent area west of the Sabine River. In some alarm
      Vives made haste to say that the King did not insist upon the confirmation
      of these grants. In the end he professed himself satisfied with Mr.
      Adams's explanations; he would send a messenger to report to His Majesty
      and to secure formal authorization to exchange ratifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another long period of suspense followed. The Spanish Cortes did not
      advise the King to accept the treaty until October; the Senate did not
      reaffirm its ratification until the following February; and it was two
      years to a day after the signing of the treaty that Adams and Vives
      exchanged formal ratifications. Again Adams confided to the pages of his
      diary, so that posterity might read, the conviction that the hand of an
      Overruling Providence was visible in this, the most important event of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, as many thought, the Administration had delayed recognition of the
      South American republics in order not to offend Spanish feelings while the
      Florida treaty was under consideration, it had now no excuse for further
      hesitation; yet it was not until March 8, 1822, that President Monroe
      announced to Congress his belief that the time had come when those
      provinces of Spain which had declared their independence and were in the
      enjoyment of it should be formally recognized. On the 19th of June he
      received the accredited charge d'affaires of the Republic of Colombia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem of recognition was not the only one which the impending
      dissolution of the Spanish colonial empire left to harass the Secretary of
      State. Just because Spain had such vast territorial pretensions and held
      so little by actual occupation on the North American continent, there was
      danger that these shadowy claims would pass into the hands of aggressive
      powers with the will and resources to aggrandize themselves. One day in
      January, 1821, while Adams was awaiting the outcome of his conferences
      with Vives, Stratford Canning, the British Minister, was announced at his
      office. Canning came to protest against what he understood was the
      decision of the United States to extend its settlements at the mouth of
      the Columbia River. Adams replied that he knew of no such determination;
      but he deemed it very probable that the settlements on the Pacific coast
      would be increased. Canning expressed rather ill-matured surprise at this
      statement, for he conceived that such a policy would be a palpable
      violation of the Convention of 1818. Without replying, Adams rose from his
      seat to procure a copy of the treaty and then read aloud the parts
      referring to the joint occupation of the Oregon country. A stormy colloquy
      followed in which both participants seem to have lost their tempers. Next
      day Canning returned to the attack, and Adams challenged the British claim
      to the mouth of the Columbia. "Why," exclaimed Canning, "do you not KNOW
      that we have a claim?" "I do not KNOW," said Adams, "what you claim nor
      what you do not claim. You claim India; you claim Africa; you claim&mdash;"
      "Perhaps," said Canning, "a piece of the moon." "No," replied Adams, "I
      have not heard that you claim exclusively any part of the moon; but there
      is not a spot on THIS habitable globe that I could affirm you do not
      claim; and there is none which you may not claim with as much color of
      right as you can have to Columbia River or its mouth."
    </p>
    <p>
      With equal sang-froid, the Secretary of State met threatened aggression
      from another quarter. In September of this same year, the Czar issued a
      ukase claiming the Pacific coast as far south as the fifty-first parallel
      and declaring Bering Sea closed to the commerce of other nations. Adams
      promptly refused to recognize these pretensions and declared to Baron de
      Tuyll, the Russian Minister, "that we should contest the right of Russia
      to ANY territorial establishment on this continent, and that we should
      assume distinctly the principle that the American continents are no longer
      subjects for any new European colonial establishments." *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Before Adams retired from office, he had the satisfaction
     of concluding a treaty (1824) with Russia by which the Czar
     abandoned his claims to exclusive jurisdiction in Bering Sea
     and agreed to plant no colonies on the Pacific Coast south
     of 54 degrees 40 minutes.
</pre>
    <p>
      Not long after this interview Adams was notified by Baron Tuyll that the
      Czar, in conformity with the political principles of the allies, had
      determined in no case whatever to receive any agent from the Government of
      the Republic of Colombia or from any other government which owed its
      existence to the recent events in the New World. Adams's first impulse was
      to pen a reply that would show the inconsistency between these political
      principles and the unctuous professions of Christian duty which had
      resounded in the Holy Alliance; but the note which he drafted was, perhaps
      fortunately, not dispatched until it had been revised by President and
      Cabinet a month later, under stress of other circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      At still another focal point the interests of the United States ran
      counter to the covetous desires of European powers. Cuba, the choicest of
      the provinces of Spain, still remained nominally loyal; but, should the
      hold of Spain upon this Pearl of the Antilles relax, every maritime power
      would swoop down upon it. The immediate danger, however, was not that
      revolution would here as elsewhere sever the province from Spain, leaving
      it helpless and incapable of self-support, but that France, after invading
      Spain and restoring the monarchy, would also intervene in the affairs of
      her provinces. The transfer of Cuba to France by the grateful King was a
      possibility which haunted the dreams of George Canning at Westminster as
      well as of John Quincy Adams at Washington. The British Foreign Minister
      attempted to secure a pledge from France that she would not acquire any
      Spanish-American territory either by conquest or by treaty, while the
      Secretary of State instructed the American Minister to Spain not to
      conceal from the Spanish Government "the repugnance of the United States
      to the transfer of the Island of Cuba by Spain to any other power."
      Canning was equally fearful lest the United States should occupy Cuba and
      he would have welcomed assurances that it had no designs upon the island.
      Had he known precisely the attitude of Adams, he would have been still
      more uneasy, for Adams was perfectly sure that Cuba belonged "by the laws
      of political as well as of physical gravitation" to the North American
      continent, though he was not for the present ready to assist the operation
      of political and physical laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Events were inevitably detaching Great Britain from the concert of Europe
      and putting her in opposition to the policy of intervention, both because
      of what it meant in Spain and what it might mean when applied to the New
      World. Knowing that the United States shared these latter apprehensions,
      George Canning conceived that the two countries might join in a
      declaration against any project by any European power for subjugating the
      colonies of South America either on behalf or in the name of Spain. He
      ventured to ask Richard Rush, American Minister at London, what his
      government would say to such a proposal. For his part he was quite willing
      to state publicly that he believed the recovery of the colonies by Spain
      to be hopeless; that recognition of their independence was only a question
      of proper time and circumstance; that Great Britain did not aim at the
      possession of any of them, though she could not be indifferent to their
      transfer to any other power. "If," said Canning, "these opinions and
      feelings are, as I firmly believe them to be, common to your government
      with ours, why should we hesitate mutually to confide them to each other;
      and to declare them in the face of the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Why, indeed? To Rush there occurred one good and sufficient answer, which,
      however, he could not make: he doubted the disinterestedness of Great
      Britain. He could only reply that he would not feel justified in assuming
      the responsibility for a joint declaration unless Great Britain would
      first unequivocally recognize the South American republics; and, when
      Canning balked at the suggestion, he could only repeat, in as conciliatory
      manner as possible, his reluctance to enter into any engagement. Not once
      only but three times Canning repeated his overtures, even urging Rush to
      write home for powers and instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispatches of Rush seemed so important to President Monroe that he
      sent copies of them to Jefferson and Madison, with the query&mdash;which
      revealed his own attitude&mdash;whether the moment had not arrived when
      the United States might safely depart from its traditional policy and meet
      the proposal of the British Government. If there was one principle which
      ran consistently through the devious foreign policy of Jefferson and
      Madison, it was that of political isolation from Europe. "Our first and
      fundamental maxim," Jefferson wrote in reply, harking back to the old
      formulas, "should be never to entangle ourselves in the broils of Europe,
      our second never to suffer Europe to intermeddle with Cis-Atlantic
      affairs." He then continued in this wise:
    </p>
    <p>
      "America, North and South, has a set of interests distinct from those of
      Europe, and peculiarly her own. She should therefore have a system of her
      own, separate and apart from that of Europe. While the last is laboring to
      become the domicile of despotism, our endeavor should surely be, to make
      our hemisphere that of freedom. One nation, most of all, could disturb us
      in this pursuit; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By
      acceding to her proposition, we detach her from the band of despots, bring
      her mighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a
      continent at one stroke which might otherwise linger long in doubt and
      difficulty.... I am clearly of Mr. Canning's opinion, that it will
      prevent, instead of provoking war. With Great Britain withdrawn from their
      scale and shifted into that of our two continents, all Europe combined
      would not undertake such a war.... Nor is the occasion to be slighted
      which this proposition offers, of declaring our protest against the
      atrocious violations of the rights of nations, by the interference of any
      one in the internal affairs of another, so flagitiously begun by
      Buonaparte, and now continued by the equally lawless alliance, calling
      itself Holy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madison argued the case with more reserve but arrived at the same
      conclusion: "There ought not to be any backwardness therefore, I think, in
      meeting her [England] in the way she has proposed." The dispatches of Rush
      produced a very different effect, however, upon the Secretary of State,
      whose temperament fed upon suspicion and who now found plenty of food for
      thought both in what Rush said and in what he did not say. Obviously
      Canning was seeking a definite compact with the United States against the
      designs of the allies, not out of any altruistic motive but for selfish
      ends. Great Britain, Rush had written bluntly, had as little sympathy with
      popular rights as it had on the field of Lexington. It was bent on
      preventing France from making conquests, not on making South America free.
      Just so, Adams reasoned: Canning desires to secure from the United States
      a public pledge "ostensibly against the forcible interference of the Holy
      Alliance between Spain and South America; but really or especially against
      the acquisition to the United States themselves of any part of the
      Spanish-American possessions." By joining with Great Britain we would give
      her a "substantial and perhaps inconvenient pledge against ourselves, and
      really obtain nothing in return." He believed that it would be more candid
      and more dignified to decline Canning's overtures and to avow our
      principles explicitly to Russia and France. For his part he did not wish
      the United States "to come in as a cock-boat in the wake of the British
      man-of-war!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Adams argued in the sessions of the Cabinet, quite ignorant of the
      correspondence which had passed between the President and his mentors.
      Confident of his ability to handle the situation, he asked no more
      congenial task than to draft replies to Baron Tuyll and to Canning and
      instructions to the ministers at London, St. Petersburg, and Paris; but he
      impressed upon Monroe the necessity of making all these communications
      "part of a combined system of policy and adapted to each other." Not so
      easily, however, was the President detached from the influence of the two
      Virginia oracles. He took sharp exception to the letter which Adams
      drafted in reply to Baron Tuyll, saying that he desired to refrain from
      any expressions which would irritate the Czar; and thus turned what was to
      be an emphatic declaration of principles into what Adams called "the
      tamest of state papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary's draft of instructions to Rush had also to run the gauntlet
      of amendment by the President and his Cabinet; but it emerged
      substantially unaltered in content and purpose. Adams professed to find
      common ground with Great Britain, while pointing out with much subtlety
      that if she believed the recovery of the colonies by Spain was really
      hopeless, she was under moral obligation to recognize them as independent
      states and to favor only such an adjustment between them and the mother
      country as was consistent with the fact of independence. The United States
      was in perfect accord with the principles laid down by Mr. Canning: it
      desired none of the Spanish possessions for itself but it could not see
      with indifference any portion of them transferred to any other power. Nor
      could the United States see with indifference "any attempt by one or more
      powers of Europe to restore those new states to the crown of Spain, or to
      deprive them, in any manner whatever, of the freedom and independence
      which they have acquired." But, for accomplishing the purposes which the
      two governments had in common&mdash;and here the masterful Secretary of
      State had his own way&mdash;it was advisable THAT THEY SHOULD ACT
      SEPARATELY, each making such representations to the continental allies as
      circumstances dictated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further communications from Baron Tuyll gave Adams the opportunity, which
      he had once lost, of enunciating the principles underlying American
      policy. In a masterly paper dated November 27, 1823, he adverted to the
      declaration of the allied monarchs that they would never compound with
      revolution but would forcibly interpose to guarantee the tranquillity of
      civilized states. In such declarations "the President," wrote Adams,
      "wishes to perceive sentiments, the application of which is limited, and
      intended in their results to be limited to the affairs of Europe.... The
      United States of America, and their government, could not see with
      indifference, the forcible interposition of any European Power, other than
      Spain, either to restore the dominion of Spain over her emancipated
      Colonies in America, or to establish Monarchical Governments in those
      Countries, or to transfer any of the possessions heretofore or yet subject
      to Spain in the American Hemisphere, to any other European Power."
    </p>
    <p>
      But so little had the President even yet grasped the wide sweep of the
      policy which his Secretary of State was framing that, when he read to the
      Cabinet a first draft of his annual message, he expressed his pointed
      disapprobation of the invasion of Spain by France and urged an
      acknowledgment of Greece as an independent nation. This declaration was,
      as Adams remarked, a call to arms against all Europe. And once again he
      urged the President to refrain from any utterance which might be construed
      as a pretext for retaliation by the allies. If they meant to provoke a
      quarrel with the United States, the administration must meet it and not
      invite it. "If they intend now to interpose by force, we shall have as
      much as we can do to prevent them," said he, "without going to bid them
      defiance in the heart of Europe." "The ground I wish to take," he
      continued, "is that of earnest remonstrance against the interference of
      the European powers by force with South America, but to disclaim all
      interference on our part with Europe; to make an American cause and adhere
      inflexibly to that." In the end Adams had his way and the President
      revised the paragraphs dealing with foreign affairs so as to make them
      conform to Adams's desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one who reads the message which President Monroe sent to Congress on
      December 2, 1823, can fail to observe that the paragraphs which have an
      enduring significance as declarations of policy are anticipated in the
      masterly state papers of the Secretary of State. Alluding to the
      differences with Russia in the Pacific Northwest, the President repeated
      the principle which Adams had stated to Baron Tuyll: "The occasion has
      been judged proper for asserting, as a principle in which the rights and
      interests of the United States are involved, that the American continents,
      by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and
      maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future
      colonization by any European powers." And the vital principle of
      abstention from European affairs and of adherence to a distinctly American
      system, for which Adams had contended so stubbornly, found memorable
      expression in the following paragraph:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the wars of the European powers in matters relating to themselves we
      have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our policy so to do.
      It is only when our rights are invaded or seriously menaced that we resent
      injuries or make preparations for our defense. With the movements in this
      hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately connected, and by causes
      which must be obvious to all enlightened and impartial observers. The
      political system of the allied powers is essentially different in this
      respect from that of America. This difference proceeds from that which
      exists in their respective Governments; and to the defense of our own,
      which has been achieved by the loss of so much blood and treasure, and
      matured by the wisdom of their most enlightened citizens, and under which
      we have enjoyed unexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted. We owe
      it, therefore, to candor and to the amicable relations existing between
      the United States and those powers to declare that we should consider any
      attempt on their part to extend their system to any portion of this
      hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing
      colonies and dependencies of any European power we have not interfered and
      shall not interfere. But with the Governments who have declared their
      independence and maintained it, and whose independence we have, on great
      consideration and on just principles, acknowledged, we could not view any
      interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any
      other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than
      as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United
      States."
    </p>
    <p>
      Later generations have read strange meanings into Monroe's message, and
      have elevated into a "doctrine" those declarations of policy which had
      only an immediate application. With the interpretations and applications
      of a later day, this book has nothing to do. Suffice it to say that
      President Monroe and his advisers accomplished their purposes; and the
      evidence that they were successful is contained in a letter which Richard
      Rush wrote to the Secretary of State, on December 27, 1823:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the most decisive blow to all despotick interference with the new
      States is that which it has received in the President's Message at the
      opening of Congress. It was looked for here with extraordinary interest at
      this juncture, and I have heard that the British packet which left New
      York the beginning of this month was instructed to wait for it and bring
      it over with all speed.... On its publicity in London... the credit of all
      the Spanish American securities immediately rose, and the question of the
      final and complete safety of the new States from all European coercion, is
      now considered as at rest."

      CHAPTER XV. THE END OF AN ERA
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of the diplomatic contest for the Floridas that James
      Monroe was for the second time elected to the Presidency, with singularly
      little display of partisanship. This time all the electoral votes but one
      were cast for him. Of all the Presidents only George Washington has
      received a unanimous vote; and to Monroe, therefore, belongs the
      distinction of standing second to the Father of his Country in the vote of
      electors. The single vote which Monroe failed to get fell to his Secretary
      of State, John Quincy Adams. It is a circumstance of some interest that
      the father of the Secretary, old John Adams, so far forgot his Federalist
      antecedents that he served as Republican elector in Massachusetts and cast
      his vote for James Monroe. Never since parties emerged in the second
      administration of Washington had such extraordinary unanimity prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across this scene of political harmony, however, the Missouri controversy
      cast the specter-like shadow of slavery. For the moment, and often in
      after years, it seemed inevitable that parties would spring into new vigor
      following sectional lines. All patriots were genuinely alarmed. "This
      momentous question," wrote Jefferson, "like a fire bell in the night,
      awakened and filled me with terror. I considered it at once as the knell
      of the Union. It is hushed, indeed, for the moment. But this is a reprieve
      only, not a final sentence."
    </p>
    <p>
      What Jefferson termed a reprieve was the settlement of the Missouri
      question by the compromise of 1820. To the demands of the South that
      Missouri should be admitted into the Union as a slave State, with the
      constitution of her choice, the North yielded, on condition that the rest
      of the Louisiana Purchase north of 36 degrees 30' should be forever free.
      Henceforth slaveholders might enter Missouri and the rest of the old
      province of Louisiana below her southern boundary line, but beyond this
      line, into the greater Northwest, they might not take their human
      chattels. To this act of settlement President Monroe gave his assent, for
      he believed that further controversy would shake the Union to its very
      foundations. With the angry criminations and recriminations of North and
      South ringing in his ears, Jefferson had little faith in the permanency of
      such a settlement. "A geographical line," said he, "coinciding with a
      marked principle, moral and political, once conceived and held up to the
      angry passions of men, will never be obliterated; and every new irritation
      will mark it deeper and deeper." And Madison, usually optimistic about the
      future of his beloved country, indulged only the gloomiest forebodings
      about slavery. Both the ex-Presidents took what comfort they could in
      projects of emancipation and deportation. Jefferson would have had
      slaveholders yield up slaves born after a certain date to the guardianship
      of the State, which would then provide for their removal to Santo Domingo
      at a proper age. Madison took heart at the prospect opened up by the
      Colonization Society which he trusted would eventually end "this dreadful
      calamity" of human slavery. Fortunately for their peace of mind, neither
      lived to see these frail hopes dashed to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signs were not wanting that statesmen of the Virginia school were not to
      be leaders in the new era which was dawning. On several occasions both
      Madison and Monroe had shown themselves out of touch with the newer
      currents of national life. Their point of view was that of the epoch which
      began with the French Revolution and ended with the overthrow of Napoleon
      and the pacification of Europe. Inevitably foreign affairs had absorbed
      their best thought. To maintain national independence against foreign
      aggression had been their constant purpose, whether the menace came from
      Napoleon's designs upon Louisiana, or from British disregard of neutral
      rights, or from Spanish helplessness on the frontiers of her Empire. But
      now, with political and commercial independence assured, a new direction
      was imparted to national endeavor. America made a volte-face and turned to
      the setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the second quarter of the nineteenth century every ounce of
      national vitality went into the conquest and settlement of the Mississippi
      Valley. Once more at peace with the world, Americans set themselves to the
      solution of the problems which grew out of this vast migration from the
      Atlantic seaboard to the interior. These were problems of territorial
      organization, of distribution of public lands, of inland trade, of
      highways and waterways, of revenue and appropriation problems that focused
      in the offices of the Secretaries of the Treasury and of War. And lurking
      behind all was the specter of slavery and sectionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      To impatient homeseekers who crossed the Alleghanies, it never occurred to
      question the competence of the Federal Government to meet all their wants.
      That the Government at Washington should construct and maintain highways,
      improve and facilitate the navigation of inland waterways, seemed a most
      reasonable expectation. What else was government for? But these proposed
      activities did not seem so obviously legitimate to Presidents of the
      Virginia Dynasty; not so readily could they waive constitutional scruples.
      Madison felt impelled to veto a bill for constructing roads and canals and
      improving waterways because he could find nowhere in the Constitution any
      specific authority for the Federal Government to embark on a policy of
      internal improvements. His last message to Congress set forth his
      objections in detail and was designed to be his farewell address. He would
      rally his party once more around the good old Jeffersonian doctrines.
      Monroe felt similar doubts when he was presented with a bill to authorize
      the collection of tolls on the new Cumberland Road. In a veto message of
      prodigious length he, too, harked back to the original Republican
      principle of strict construction of the Constitution. The leadership which
      the Virginians thus refused to take fell soon to men of more resolute
      character who would not let the dead hand of legalism stand between them
      and their hearts' desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one of the ironies of American history that the settlement of the
      Mississippi Valley and of the Gulf plains brought acute pecuniary distress
      to the three great Virginians who had bent all their energies to acquire
      these vast domains.. The lure of virgin soil drew men and women in ever
      increasing numbers from the seaboard States. Farms that had once sufficed
      were cast recklessly on the market to bring what they would, while their
      owners staked their claims on new soil at a dollar and a quarter an acre.
      Depreciation of land values necessarily followed in States like Virginia;
      and the three ex-Presidents soon found themselves landpoor. In common with
      other planters, they had invested their surplus capital in land, only to
      find themselves unable to market their crops in the trying days of the
      Embargo and NonIntercourse Acts. They had suffered heavy losses from the
      British blockade during the war, and they had not fully recovered from
      these reverses when the general fall of prices came in 1819. Believing
      that they were facing only a temporary condition, they met their
      difficulties by financial expedients which in the end could only add to
      their burdens.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general reluctance to change their manner of life and to practice an
      intensive agriculture with diversified crops contributed, no doubt, to the
      general depression of planters in the Old Dominion. Jefferson at
      Monticello, Madison at Montpelier, and to a lesser extent Monroe at Oak
      Hill, maintained their old establishments and still dispensed a lavish
      Southern hospitality, which indeed they could hardly avoid. A former
      President is forever condemned to be a public character. All kept open
      house for their friends, and none could bring himself to close his door to
      strangers, even when curiosity was the sole motive for intrusion. Sorely
      it must have tried the soul of Mrs. Randolph to find accommodations at
      Monticello for fifty uninvited and unexpected guests. Mrs. Margaret Bayard
      Smith, who has left lively descriptions of life at Montpelier, was once
      one of twenty-three guests. When a friend commented on the circumstance
      that no less than nine strange horses were feeding in the stables at
      Montpelier, Madison remarked somewhat grimly that he was delighted with
      the society of the owners but could not confess to the same enthusiasm at
      the presence of their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Jefferson and Madison were victims of the indiscretion of others.
      Madison was obliged to pay the debts of a son of Mrs. Madison by her first
      marriage and became so financially embarrassed that he was forced to ask
      President Biddle of the Bank of the United States for a long loan of six
      thousand dollars&mdash;only to suffer the humiliation of a refusal. He had
      then to part with some of his lands at a great sacrifice, but he retained
      Montpelier and continued to reside there, though in reduced circumstances,
      until his death in 1836. At about the same time Jefferson received what he
      called his coup de grace. He had endorsed a note of twenty thousand
      dollars for Governor Wilson C. Nicholas and upon his becoming insolvent
      was held to the full amount of the note. His only assets were his lands
      which would bring only a fifth of their former price. To sell on these
      ruinous terms was to impoverish himself and his family. His distress was
      pathetic. In desperation he applied to the Legislature for permission to
      sell his property by lottery; but he was spared this last humiliation by
      the timely aid of friends, who started popular subscriptions to relieve
      his distress. Monroe was less fortunate, for he was obliged to sell Oak
      Hill and to leave Old Virginia forever. He died in New York City on the
      Fourth of July, 1831.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter years of Jefferson's life were cheered by the renewal of his
      old friendship with John Adams, now in retirement at Quincy. Full of
      pleasant reminiscence are the letters which passed between them, and full
      too of allusions to the passing show. Neither had lost all interest in
      politics, but both viewed events with the quiet contemplation of old men.
      Jefferson was absorbed to the end in his last great hobby, the university
      that was slowly taking bodily form four miles away across the valley from
      Monticello. When bodily infirmities would not permit him to ride so far,
      he would watch the workmen through a telescope mounted on one of the
      terraces. "Crippled wrists and fingers make writing slow and laborious,"
      he wrote to Adams. "But while writing to you, I lose the sense of these
      things in the recollection of ancient times, when youth and health made
      happiness out of everything. I forget for a while the hoary winter of age,
      when we can think of nothing but how to keep ourselves warm, and how to
      get rid of our heavy hours until the friendly hand of death shall rid us
      of all at once. Against this tedium vitae, however, I am fortunately
      mounted on a hobby, which, indeed, I should have better managed some
      thirty or forty years ago; but whose easy amble is still sufficient to
      give exercise and amusement to an octogenary rider. This is the
      establishment of a University." Alluding to certain published letters
      which revived old controversies, he begged his old friend not to allow his
      peace of mind to be shaken. "It would be strange indeed, if, at our years,
      we were to go back an age to hunt up imaginary or forgotten facts, to
      disturb the repose of affections so sweetening to the evening of our
      lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence approached,
      Jefferson and Adams were besought to take part in the celebration which
      was to be held in Philadelphia. The infirmities of age rested too heavily
      upon them to permit their journeying so far; but they consecrated the day
      anew with their lives. At noon, on the Fourth of July, 1826, while the
      Liberty Bell was again sounding its old message to the people of
      Philadelphia, the soul of Thomas Jefferson passed on; and a few hours
      later John Adams entered into rest, with the name of his old friend upon
      his lips.

      BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      GENERAL WORKS
    </p>
    <p>
      Five well-known historians have written comprehensive works on the period
      covered by the administrations of Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe: John B.
      McMaster has stressed the social and economic aspects in "A History of the
      People of the United States;" James Schouler has dwelt upon the political
      and constitutional problems in his "History of the United States of
      America under the Constitution;" Woodrow Wilson has written a "History of
      the American People" which indeed is less a history than a brilliant essay
      on history; Hermann von Holst has construed the "Constitutional and
      Political History of the United States "in terms of the slavery
      controversy; and Edward Channing has brought forward his painstaking
      "History of the United States," touching many phases of national life, to
      the close of the second war with England. To these general histories
      should be added "The American Nation," edited by Albert Bushnell Hart,
      three volumes of which span the administrations of the three Virginians:
      E. Channing's "The Jeffersonian System" (1906); K. C. Babcock's "The Rise
      of American Nationality" (1906); F. J. Turner's "Rise of the New West"
      (1906).

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      No historian can approach this epoch without doing homage to Henry Adams,
      whose "History of the United States," 9 vols. (1889-1891), is at once a
      literary performance of extraordinary merit and a treasure-house of
      information. Skillfully woven into the text is documentary material from
      foreign archives which Adams, at great expense, had transcribed and
      translated. Intimate accounts of Washington and its society may be found
      in the following books: G. Gibbs, "Memoirs of the Administrations of
      Washington and John Adams", 2 vols. (1846); Mrs. Margaret Bayard Smith,
      "The First Forty Years of Washington Society" (1906); Anne H. Wharton,
      "Social Life in the Early Republic" (1902). "The Life of Thomas
      Jefferson," 3 vols. (1858), by Henry S. Randall is rich in authentic
      information about the life of the great Virginia statesman but it is
      marred by excessive hero-worship. Interesting side-lights on Jefferson and
      his entourage are shed by his granddaughter, Sarah N. Randolph, in a
      volume called "Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson" (1871).

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The problems of patronage that beset President Jefferson are set forth by
      Gaillard Hunt in "Office-seeking during Jefferson's Administration," in
      the "American Historical Review," vol. III, p. 271, and by Carl R. Fish in
      "The Civil Service and the Patronage" (1905). There is no better way to
      enter sympathetically into Jefferson's mental world than to read his
      correspondence. The best edition of his writings is that by Paul Leicester
      Ford. Henry Adams has collected the "Writings of Albert Gallatin," 3 vols.
      (1879), and has written an admirable "Life of Albert Gallatin" (1879).
      Gaillard Hunt has written a short "Life of James Madison" (1902), and has
      edited his "Writings," 9 vols. (1900-1910). The Federalist attitude toward
      the Administration is reflected in the "Works of Fisher Ames," 2 vols.
      (1857). The intense hostility of New England Federalists appears also in
      such books as Theodore Dwight's "The Character of Thomas Jefferson, as
      exhibited in His Own Writings" (1839). Franklin B. Dexter has set forth
      the facts relating to Abraham Bishop, that arch-rebel against the standing
      order in Connecticut, in the "Proceedings" of the Massachusetts Historical
      Society, March, 1906.

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The larger histories of the American navy by Maclay, Spears, and Clark
      describe the war with Tripoli, but by far the best account is G. W.
      Allen's "Our Navy and the Barbary Corsairs" (1905), which may be
      supplemented by C. O. Paullin's "Commodore John Rodgers" (1910). T.
      Harris's "Life and Services of Commodore William Bainbridge" (1837)
      contains much interesting information about service in the Mediterranean
      and the career of this gallant commander. C. H. Lincoln has edited "The
      Hull-Eaton Correspondence during the Expedition against Tripoli 1804-5"
      for the Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society, vol. XXI (1911).
      The treaties and conventions with the Barbary States are contained in
      "Treaties, Conventions, International Acts, Protocols and Agreements
      between the United States of America and Other Powers," compiled by W. M.
      Malloy, 3 vols. (1910-1913).

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Even after the lapse of many years, Henry Adams's account of the purchase
      of Louisiana remains the best: Volumes I and II of his "History of the
      United States." J. A. Robertson in his "Louisiana under the Rule of Spain,
      France, and the United States," 1785-1807, 2 vols. (1911), has brought
      together a mass of documents relating to the province and territory.
      Barbe-Marbois, "Histoire de la Louisiana et de la Cession" (1829), which
      is now accessible in translation, is the main source of information for
      the French side of the negotiations. Frederick J. Turner, in a series of
      articles contributed to the "American Historical Review" (vols. II, III,
      VII, VIII, X), has pointed out the significance of the diplomatic contest
      for the Mississippi Valley. Louis Pelzer has written on the "Economic
      Factors in the Acquisition of Louisiana" in the "Proceedings" of the
      Mississippi Valley Historical Association, vol. VI (1913). There is no
      adequate biography of either Monroe or Livingston. T. L. Stoddard has
      written on "The French Revolution in San Domingo" (1914).

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      The vexed question of the boundaries of Louisiana is elucidated by Henry
      Adams in volumes II and III of his "History of the United States." Among
      the more recent studies should be mentioned the articles contributed by
      Isaac J. Cox to volumes VI and X of the "Quarterly" of the Texas State
      Historical Association, and an article entitled "Was Texas Included in the
      Louisiana Purchase?" by John R. Ficklen in the "Publications" of the
      Southern History Association, vol. V. In the first two chapters of his
      "History of the Western Boundary of the Louisiana Purchase" (1914), T. M.
      Marshall has given a resume of the boundary question. Jefferson brought
      together the information which he possessed in "An Examination into the
      boundaries of Louisiana," which was first published in 1803 and which has
      been reprinted by the American Philosophical Society in "Documents
      relating to the Purchase and Exploration of Louisiana" (1904). I. J. Cox
      has made an important contribution by his book on "The Early Exploration
      of Louisiana" (1906). The constitutional questions involved in the
      purchase and organization of Louisiana are reviewed at length by E. S.
      Brown in "The Constitutional History of the Louisiana Purchase, 1803-1812"
      (1920).

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The most painstaking account of Burr's expedition is W. F. McCaleb's "The
      Aaron Burr Conspiracy" (1903) which differs from Henry Adams's version in
      making James Wilkinson rather than Burr the heavy villain in the plot.
      Wilkinson's own account of the affair, which is thoroughly untrustworthy,
      is contained in his "Memoirs of My Own Times," 3 vols. (1816). The
      treasonable intrigues of Wilkinson are proved beyond doubt by the
      investigations of W. R. Shepherd, "Wilkinson and the Beginnings of the
      Spanish Conspiracy," in vol. IX of "The American Historical Review," and
      of I. J. Cox, "General Wilkinson and His Later Intrigues with the
      Spaniards," in vol. XIX of "The American Historical Review." James
      Parton's "Life and Times of Aaron Burr" (1858) is a biography of
      surpassing interest but must be corrected at many points by the works
      already cited. William Coleman's "Collection of the Facts and the
      Documents relative to the Death of Major-General Alexander Hamilton"
      (1804) contains the details of the great tragedy. The Federalist intrigues
      with Burr are traced by Henry Adams and more recently by S. E. Morison in
      the "Life and Letters of Harrison Gray Otis," 2 vols. (1913). W. H.
      Safford's "Blennerhassett Papers" (1861) and David Robertson's "Reports of
      the Trials of Colonel Aaron Burr for Treason, and for a Misdemeanor," 2
      vols. (1808), brought to light many interesting facts relating to the
      alleged conspiracy. The "Official Letter Books of W. C. C. Claiborne,
      1801-1816," 6 vols. (1917), contain material of great value.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The history of impressment has yet to be written, but J. R. Hutchinson's
      "The Press-Gang Afloat and Ashore" (1913) has shown clearly that the
      baleful effects of the British practice were not felt solely by American
      shipmasters. Admiral A. T. Mahan devoted a large part of his first volume
      on "Sea Power in its relations to the War of 1812," 2 vols. (1905), to the
      antecedents of the war. W. E. Lingelbach has made a notable contribution
      to our understanding of the Essex case in his article on "England and
      Neutral Trade" printed in "The Military Historian and Economist," vol. II
      (1917). Of the contemporary pamphlets, two are particularly illuminating:
    </p>
    <p>
      James Stephen, "War in Disguise; or, the Frauds of the Neutral Flags"
      (1805), presenting the English grievances, and "An Examination of the
      British Doctrine, which Subjects to Capture a Neutral Trade, not open in
      Time of Peace," prepared by the Department of State under Madison's
      direction in 1805. Captain Basil Hall's "Voyages and Travels" (1895) gives
      a vivid picture of life aboard a British frigate in American waters. A
      graphic account of the Leopard-Chesapeake affair is given by Henry Adams
      in Chapter I of his fourth volume.

    <h2>
      CHAPTERS VIII AND IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Besides the histories of Mahan and Adams, the reader will do well to
      consult several biographies for information about peaceable coercion in
      theory and practice. Among these may be mentioned Randall's "Life of
      Thomas Jefferson," Adams's "Life of Albert Gallatin" and "John Randolph"
      in the "American Statesmen Series," W. E. Dodd's "Life of Nathaniel Macon"
      (1903), D. R. Anderson's "William Branch Giles" (1914), and J. B.
      McMaster's "Life and Times of Stephen Girard," 2 vols. (1917). For want of
      an adequate biography of Monroe, recourse must be taken to the "Writings
      of James Monroe," 7 vols. (1898-1903), edited by S. M. Hamilton. J. B.
      Moore's "Digest of International Law", 8 vols. (1906), contains a mass of
      material bearing on the rights of neutrals and the problems of neutral
      trade. The French decrees and the British orders-in-council were submitted
      to Congress with a message by President Jefferson on the 23d of December,
      1808, and may be found in "American State Papers, Foreign Relations," vol.
      III.

    <p>
      The relations of the United States and Spanish Florida are set forth in
      many works, of which three only need be mentioned: H. B. Fuller, "The
      Purchase of Florida" (1906), has devoted several chapters to the early
      history of the Floridas, but so far as West Florida is concerned his work
      is superseded by I. J. Cox's "The West Florida Controversy, 1789-1813"
      (1918). The first volume, "Diplomacy," of F. E. Chadwick's "Relations of
      the United States and Spain," 3 vols. (1909-11), gives an account of the
      several Florida controversies. Several books contribute to an
      understanding of the temper of the young insurgents in the Republican
      Party: Carl Schurz's "Henry Clay," 2 vols. (1887), W. M. Meigs's "Life of
      John Caldwell Calhoun," 2 vols. (1917), M. P. Follett's "The Speaker of
      the House of Representatives" (1896), and Henry Adams's "John Randolph"
      (1882).

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The civil history of President Madison's second term of office may be
      followed in Adams's "History of the United States," vols. VII, VIII, and
      IX; in Hunt's "Life of James Madison;" in Adams's "Life of Albert
      Gallatin;" and in such fragmentary records of men and events as are found
      in the "Memoirs and Letters of Dolly Madison" (1886) and Mrs. M. B.
      Smith's "The First Forty Years of Washington Society" (1906). The history
      of New England Federalism may be traced in H. C. Lodge's "Life and Letters
      of George Cabot" (1878); in Edmund Quincy's "Life of Josiah Quincy of
      Massachusetts" (1867); in the "Life of Timothy Pickering," 4 vols.
      (1867-73); and in S. E. Morison's "Life and Letters of Harrison Gray
      Otis," 2 vols. (1913). Theodore Dwight published his "History of the
      Hartford Convention" in 1833. Henry Adams has collected the "Documents
      relating to New England Federalism," 1800-1815 (1878). The Federalist
      opposition to the war is reflected in such books as Mathew Carey's "The
      Olive Branch; or, Faults on Both Sides" (1814) and William Sullivan's
      "Familiar Letters on Public Characters" (1834).

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The history of the negotiations at Ghent has been recounted by Mahan and
      Henry Adams, and more recently by F. A. Updyke, "The Diplomacy of the War
      of 1812" (1915). Aside from the "State Papers," the chief sources of
      information are Adams's "Life of Gallatin" and "Writings of Gallatin" the
      "Memoirs of John Quincy Adams," 12 vols. (1874-1877), and "Writings of
      John Quincy Adams" 7 vols. (1913-), edited by W. C. Ford, the "Papers of
      James A. Bayard, 1796-1815" (1915), edited by Elizabeth Donnan, the
      "Correspondence, Despatches, and Other Papers, of Viscount Castlereagh,"
      12 vols. (1851-53), and the "Supplementary Despatches of the Duke of
      Wellington," 15 vols. (1858-78). The Proceedings of the Massachusetts
      Historical Society, vol. XLVIII (1915), contain the instructions of the
      British commissioners. "A Great Peace Maker, the Diary of James Gallatin,
      Secretary to Albert Gallatin" (1914) records many interesting boyish
      impressions of the commissioners and their labors at Ghent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The want of a good biography of James Monroe is felt increasingly as one
      enters upon the history of his administrations. Some personal items may be
      gleaned from "A Narrative of a Tour of Observation Made during the Summer
      of 1817" (1818); and many more may be found in the "Memoirs and Writings"
      of John Quincy Adams. The works by Fuller and Chadwick already cited deal
      with the negotiations leading to the acquisition of Florida. The "Memoirs
      et Souvenirs" of Hyde de Neuville, 3 vols. (1893-4), supplement the record
      which Adams left in his diary. J. S. Bassett's "Life of Andrew Jackson," 2
      vols. (1911), is far less entertaining than James Parton's "Life of Andrew
      Jackson," 3 vols. (1860), but much more reliable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The problem of the recognition of the South American republics has been
      put in its historical setting by F. L. Paxson in "The Independence of the
      South American Republics" (1903). The relations of the United States and
      Spain are described by F. E. Chadwick in the work already cited and by J.
      H. Latane in "The United States and Latin America" (1920). To these titles
      may be added J. M. Callahan's "Cuba and International Relations" (1899).
      The studies of Worthington C. Ford have given John Quincy Adams a much
      larger share in formulating the Monroe Doctrine than earlier historians
      have accorded him. The origin of President Monroe's message is traced by
      Mr. Ford in "Some Original Documents on the Genesis of the Monroe
      Doctrine," in the "Proceedings" of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
      1902, and the subject is treated at greater length by him in "The American
      Historical Review," vols. VII and VIII. The later evolution and
      application of the Monroe Doctrine may be followed in Herbert Kraus's "Die
      Monroedoktrin in ihren Beziehungen zur Amerikanischen Diplomatie and zum
      Volkerrecht" (1913), a work which should be made more accessible to
      American readers by translation.

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The subjects touched upon in this closing chapter are treated with great
      skill by Frederick J. Turner in his "Rise of the New West" (1906). On the
      slavery controversy, an article by J. A. Woodburn, "The Historical
      Significance of the Missouri Compromise," in the "Report" of the American
      Historical Association for 1893, and an article by F. H. Hodder, "Side
      Lights on the Missouri Compromise," in the "Report" for 1909, may be read
      with profit. D. R. Dewey's "Financial History of the United States" (1903)
      and F. W. Taussig's "Tariff History of the United States" (revised
      edition, 1914) are standard manuals. Edward Stanwood's "History of the
      Presidency," 2 vols. (1916), contains the statistics of presidential
      elections. T. H. Benton's "Thirty Years' View; or, A History of the
      Working of American Government, 1820-1850," 2 vols. (1854-56), becomes an
      important source of information on congressional matters. The latter years
      of Jefferson's life are described by Randall and the closing years of John
      Adams's career by Charles Francis Adams.

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
