<p class="caption2">INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>When General Lázaro Cardenas was President of the Republic of México,
encouragement was given by his administration to linguistic groups of
native American peoples to record in printed form, eventually in their
native languages, accounts of their cultural accomplishments and
accounts of the natural resources of the regions concerned. For the
Tarascan "Empire" centering in the state of Michoacán, a committee of
Mexicans and citizens of the United States of America was formed to
forward these aims. Under the leadership of ethnologists on the
committee, especially Professor Daniel Rubin F. de la Borbolla and
Professor Ralph L. Beals, invitations to coöperate in the studies were
extended to biologists. One of us (Hall) was invited to investigate
the fauna of native wild mammals. In 1943, assisted by a fellowship
which Hall at that time held from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation, and with support from Miss Annie M. Alexander, through the
University of California Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy, most of
March&mdash;March 3 to March 29, 1943&mdash;was spent in the state of Michoacán.</p>

<p>Bernardo Villa R. of the Instituto de Biología de la Universidad
de México was a member of the party from March 23 to 27. Previously,
March 4 to 22, Roberto Alcántar from the Universidad de
Michoacán, in Morelia, participated in the field work. Mr. J. R.
Alcorn was active in the collecting from the beginning until he
entrained for the United States on March 24. The remainder of
the field party was made up of E. Raymond Hall, his wife Mary F.
Hall, and their three sons, William Joel, Hubert H., and Benjamin
D. Hall.</p>

<p>From March 4 to 15 we collected at, and in the vicinity of, Pátzcuaro.
We were housed in two cottages kindly made available by
Sr. Efrain Buenrostro, in Campo Turista Janitzio, 200 meters northwest
of the railroad station in Colonia Revolución. The shore of
Lake Pátzcuaro, the cultivated fields surrounded by stone fences,
and the oak and pine forests roundabout provided varied habitats.</p>

<p>From March 16 to 23 we collected in the territory 1 to 6 miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
south of Tacámbaro, making our headquarters in the Europa Hotel,
in the town. The steep main street of Tacámbaro with native pines
at the upper end descends to plantings of bananas and sugar cane
at the lower end. Our collecting all was done below (south of) the
town in the semitropical country and none at all was done above
(north of) the town.</p>

<p>From March 24 to 27 (three night's trapping) we collected in the
vicinity of Zamora, making our headquarters in rooms diagonally
across the street intersection from the Hotel Fenix.</p>

<p>The resulting specimens, approximately 650 in number, were deposited
in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy at the University of
California at Berkeley.</p>

<p>A noteworthy coincidence is that on the very day, February 26, on
which we crossed the international border into México at Laredo, the
beginning of the new volcano, Paricutín, was announced in the daily
press. Our collecting of mammals in Michoacán was nearly all done in
sight of the towering white plume of this rapidly heightening volcanic
cone and frequently our traps were thickly dusted with its wind-borne
ash. Our eagerness at that time to have stations established for
observing the effects on vertebrates of the deposition of ash, was
gratified in that Dr. Robert T. Hatt independently had the same idea
and such observations at appropriate places and times were begun by
him and staff members of the Museum of Zoölogy of the University of
Michigan. One of us, Villa, was privileged to share in these
observations in the spring of 1947.</p>

<p>This continuing interest in the mammals of Michoacán has made
it seem, to us, the more desirable to place on record our findings
as to kinds and occurrence of species. In doing this we have examined
the collections made previously on Cerro Tancítaro and
vicinity by the field party led by Mr. Harry Hoogstraal from the
University of Illinois and the Chicago Natural History Museum.
The specimens of mammals collected by this field party are in the
Chicago Natural History Museum and we are obliged to Mr. Karl
P. Schmidt, Mr. Colin C. Sanborn and the late Dr. Wilfred H.
Osgood for the privilege of studying this material.</p>

<p>Drs. William H. Burt and Emmet T. Hooper, of the Museum of
Zoölogy of the University of Michigan, lent to us for examination
five specimens of bats, of as many species, which they had taken
in Michoacán. Drs. Remington Kellogg and Henry W. Setzer have
provided us with data on specimens of deer and peccary from
Michoacán which are in the United States National Museum.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Specimens in the Institute of Biology of the University of México
have been used. Financial provision by the Kansas University
Endowment Association has enabled us to obtain specimens needed
for comparison from other parts of México.</p>

<p>In addition to the materials mentioned above we have used published
references to mammals of Michoacán and have prepared the
following lists of kinds of mammals positively known to us to
occur in the Mexican state of Michoacán. It is noteworthy that
specimens recorded in the literature from Acámbaro, Michoacán,
no longer are to be ascribed to Michoacán, since a relocation of the
boundary between the states of Michoacán and Guanajuato, places
Acámbaro in the latter state.</p>

<p>Our aims were: (1) To record kinds of mammals positively
known from the state, under the correct scientific name, and vernacular
names in English, Spanish, and Tarascan. The first Tarascan
name is given in the spelling used by Tarascans followed by the
phonetic equivalent in English in parentheses. (2) To indicate the
geographic range of each kind in the state, and, (3) To record
miscellaneous information which it is thought probably will be
useful in one way or another to other students whose work certainly
will lengthen the list of kinds of mammals known from Michoacán
and otherwise add to our knowledge of them.</p>

<p>Several kinds of bats, of which we lack records, certainly occur
in Michoacán. Four or five kinds of cats (genus <i>Felis</i>), species of
the genera <i>Potos</i>, <i>Lutra</i>, <i>Tayra</i>, <i>Grison</i>, and several other kinds of
mammals of which we now lack positive record, also probably occur
there; the list of kinds, we expect, will number more than one
hundred species and subspecies when more intensive collecting has
been done in the state. In all, we have positive record of 85 kinds
of native, wild mammals of which specimens have been examined
or recorded from Michoacán. Distances and elevations here are
recorded either in the metric system or in the English system, according
to the system used on the labels of the specimens concerned.
Unless otherwise indicated, catalogue numbers of more than 100,000
are of specimens in the University of California Museum of Vertebrate
Zoölogy and numbers of less than 100,000 are of the Chicago
Natural History Museum.</p>

<div class="species_name">
<b>Didelphis mesamericana mesamericana</b> Oken<br />

<div class="species_ref"><i>Didelphis mes-americana</i>, Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 16:256,
August 18, 1902.</div>

<div class="smaller">
<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Statewide.</p>

<p><i>Specimens examined</i>, 7: nos. 100063-100067, 100074, 51396, distributed by localities
as follows: Pátzcuaro (3 mi. N, 6,700 ft., 1; 2 mi. W, 6,700 ft., 2; 5 mi.
S, 7,800 ft., 1), 4; Tancítaro, 1; 1-&#190; mi. S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and
6 mi. S Tacámbaro, 1.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The coarse overhair is white all the way to the base
in three specimens but is black in its distal two thirds (white in basal
third) in four specimens. The overhair, six centimeters anterior to
the base of the tail, is 83 (80-85) mm. long in the three gray specimens
(those with white overhair) and 68 (64-72) mm. long in the
black specimens. The ears and all four feet are black. The tail
is black in its proximal half and white in its distal half except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
one specimen in which the distal half is almost as dark as the
proximal half. Of the two largest specimens, one is a female from
1&#190; mi. S Tacámbaro and the other, a male is from 6 mi. S of the
same place. Measurements are: Total length, &#9794; 810, &#9792; 786;
length of tail, &#9794; 360, &#9792; 348; length of hind foot, &mdash;, 58; condylobasal
length, 110.0; 99.6; zygomatic breadth, 68.5; 59.6; length of
nasals, 59.7, 45.0. The tail amounts to 48, 48 and 47 per cent of the
total length in specimens from Pátzcuaro; 50 per cent in one from
Tancítaro; 45 and 44 per cent in two from Tacámbaro. The subspecies
<i>mesamericana</i> probably intergrades with <i>Didelphis virginiana
virginiana</i> by way of <i>D. m. texensis</i> and <i>D. v. pigra</i>, as Davis
(1944:375) and other writers suggest, in which case the proper name
of the subspecies <i>mesamericana</i> would be <i>Didelphis virginiana mesamericana</i>.
Until intergradation is actually demonstrated, it seems
best to use the name <i>D. m. mesamericana</i>.</p>

<p>Most of our specimens were caught in steel traps, at meat baits,
set for small carnivores.</p>


<p class="species_name">
<b>Marmosa canescens canescens</b> (Allen)<br />

<p><i>Specimen examined</i>, 1: no. 100062, 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The one unsexed subadult measures 5.5 mm. from Ml
to M3 inclusive, which measurement is near the minimum that
Tate (1933: table 1, Sec. 5) records for this subspecies but larger
than the maximum that he (<i>loc. cit.</i>) records for the subspecies
<i>sinaloae</i> which occurs to the northward of Michoacán. Tate (<i>op.
cit.</i>:141) lists two other specimens from Los Reyes. Our specimen
was caught in a mouse trap set in dry grass between a sugar cane field
and a patch of banana trees.</p>

29, 1892, type from north slope Sierra Nevada de Colima, approximately
8,000 feet, Jalisco.</p>

<div class="smaller">

Tancítaro (7,800 ft., 8; 9,500 ft., 1; 9,600 ft., 1; 10,000 ft., 1), 11.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Two males from Mount Tancítaro, with much worn
teeth, catalogue nos. 52132 and 52138, measure, respectively, as follows:
Total length, 122, 114; length of tail, 46, 43; length of hind
foot, 15, 14; condylobasal length, 18.4, 18.3; palatal length, 8.0, 7.3;
cranial breadth, 9.4, 9.2; least interorbital breadth, 3.7, 3.8; maxillary
breadth, 5.5, 5.5; maxillary tooth-row, 6.8, 6.7. The long palate
in no. 52132 and the broad brain case in both specimens appear to be
only individual variations or possibly variations correlated with the
advanced age of the two animals since in other features they do not
differ from specimens which are smaller in these two dimensions.
Jackson (1928:156) records specimens of this shrew from Mount
Patambán and Nahuatzin.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Our one specimen, originally a mount, proves to have
a crushed brain case. The specimen was saved on March 10, 1944,
by P. Luna, who in March, 1943, told one of us (Hall) that many
of these shrews fell into the cement fish-rearing tanks at the biological
station situated at Colonia Ibarra, a suburb of Pátzcuaro, on the
shore of Lake Pátzcuaro. We are indebted to Dr. H. H. T. Jackson
for examining our specimen and assigning a name to it.</p>

<p>The length of the thumb averages 7.4 mm. (7.0 to 7.7). As compared
with <i>G. s. alticola</i> from northeast Tlaxcala according to the
description given by Davis (1944:377), our specimens agree with

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The subspecific name <i>L. n. nivalis</i> is tentatively applied
to this specimen in the absence of an opportunity to compare
it directly with the holotype or topotypes of <i>Leptonycteris nivalis
yerbabuenae</i> Martinez and Villa (1940:291). Unfortunately, the
materials on which this name, <i>L. n. yerbabuenae</i>, was based all
were destroyed in 1945 or 1946 while Villa was absent from the
Institute of Biology of the University of México.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Our single specimen, a female, was caught on July
28, 1945, by my (B. Villa's) father, Andres Villa, in a natural cave,
roosting with the individuals of <i>Glossophaga s. leachii</i>. The northernmost
locality in México from which <i>A. p. planirostris</i> previously
has been recorded is El Papayo, in the state of Guerrero (Andersen,
1908:238), approximately 225 kilometers to the southward. <i>A. p.
planirostris</i> and <i>Artibeus jamaicensis</i> closely resemble each other
but <i>A. planirostris</i> may be recognized by the presence of a minute
M3 which is absent in <i>A. jamaicensis</i>. Specimen no. 945b has M3
present on both sides of the upper jaw. From <i>Artibeus hirsutus</i>,
known from La Salada, Michoacán, approximately 40 miles north
and slightly to the east of El Guayabo, our specimen differs in the
apparently hairless tibia and interfemoral membrane. The measurements,
of no. 945b, recorded above, if compared with those given
by Andersen (1908:246) are seen mostly to fall within the range
recorded for <i>A. hirsutus</i>. Where measurements are outside this
range, they fall within the range of those of the larger <i>A. p. planirostris</i>.
We recognize that the Mexican species of <i>Artibeus</i> are not
well understood, at least by us.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Most of these pocket gophers were caught in areas
supporting a good growth of pine trees in the same places where
the much larger pocket gopher, <i>Cratogeomys gymnurus</i>, lived. Concerning
the individual designated as the type specimen, H. H. Hall
(field notes) writes that when he was making an excavation to reveal
the gopher's burrow (5 inches below the surface), he dug deeper
than was necessary and broke into the burrow of a <i>Cratogeomys</i>
directly below. Another of us (E. R. Hall) had the same experience
where the burrow of a <i>Thomomys</i> was approximately six inches
below ground and that of a <i>Cratogeomys</i> approximately 16 inches
below the surface of the ground. At the time this arrangement
led us to wonder if <i>Thomomys</i> was in some sense a "parasite" on
the larger <i>Cratogeomys</i> by levying on food stores, if <i>Cratogeomys</i>
has any, but we found no evidence that such was the case and from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
our subsequent trapping concluded that the two-story arrangement
was accidental and not the rule. The habit of burrowing at different
levels probably was one factor which permitted the two kinds of
pocket gophers to live in the same area. The average weight of
these gophers was 86 grams in males and 74 grams in females, or
only an eighth as much as in <i>Cratogeomys</i>.</p>

to this race and two from the same place to the subspecies

<p>Where <i>R. megalotis</i> and <i>R. fulvescens</i> occur together, we find the
skull of the latter to be distinguishable by: a median spine on the
posterior border of the hard palate (truncate in <i>R. megalotis</i>); an
S-shaped instead of a C-shaped pattern on the worn occlusal face
of the last lower molar; and two re-entrant angles, on the lateral
side on the worn occlusal surface of the third upper molar, reaching
halfway across the tooth whereas in <i>R. megalotis</i> the anterior re-*entrant
angle is wanting or extends less than a third of the way

of Pátzcuaro is also referred to <i>R. m. zacatecae</i> because of small
size and reddish (less blackish) color. We lack typical specimens

</div>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Of the 19 specimens from the vicinity of Tacámbaro,
only two have the underparts reddish as does <i>R. f. inexspectatus</i>.
The upper parts are less reddish than in <i>R. f. inexspectatus</i> but
more reddish and less blackish than in <i>R. f. toltecus</i> from the valley
of México or than in <i>R. f. toltecus</i> from Zamora. The external
measurements and cranial measurements are less than in <i>R. f.
toltecus</i> or <i>R. f. inexspectatus</i> and are as small as, or even smaller
than, those of <i>R. f. tenuis</i> to the northward or than those of <i>R. f.
nelsoni</i> to the westward. Relying only on printed descriptions of
<i>R. f. tenuis</i> and <i>R. f. nelsoni</i>, we are inclined to refer our specimens
to <i>R. f. tenuis</i> although the reddish color, we suppose, is evidence of
intergradation with <i>R. f. nelsoni</i> and <i>R. f. inexspectatus</i>.</p>

<p>The four skins from Zamora are gray, as opposed to reddish, both
above and below and in this respect they agree with the description
of <i>R. f. tenuis</i>. They are lighter-colored (grayer) than either <i>R. f.
toltecus</i> or <i>R. f. inexspectatus</i>. The four specimens from Zamora
are larger than animals from the vicinity of Tacámbaro and average
slightly smaller than topotypes of <i>R. f. inexspectatus</i>.</p>

<p>By identifying our specimens as <i>R. f. inexspectatus</i> and <i>R. f.
tenuis</i>, we are left without any specimens that we, ourselves, have
examined, which are referable to the subspecies <i>R. f. toltecus</i>. The
specimens from Los Reyes which Howell (1914:47) referred to <i>R. f.
toltecus</i> have not been seen by us, and we guess, on the criteria
used by us, that the animals would be referable to <i>R. f. tenuis</i>.
Because Dr. Emmet T. Hooper has a revisionary study of the
Mexican <i>Reithrodontomys</i> underway, we have not attempted to
bring together all of the pertinent material from different collections
as would be required for an ideally thorough analysis of the geographic
variation in <i>Reithrodontomys megalotis</i> and <i>Reithrodontomys
fulvescens</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span></p>

The facts are that in our large series from the vicinity of Pátzcuaro,
the upper parts are more reddish than in <i>R. f. toltecus</i> from the
valley of México, and more reddish than in <i>R. f. tenuis</i> if we correctly
interpret Howell's (<i>op. cit.</i>,:45) description of <i>R. f. tenuis</i>. In the
color of the underparts the series is, to us, indistinguishable from
topotypical <i>toltecus</i> and therefore has more reddish underparts than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>

worn and 5 are adults. In preparing the original description of

comparison of color was made with only the winter pelage of <i>R. c.

between the two subspecies might be seasonal rather than subspecific.
A summer specimen of <i>R. c. chrysopsis</i> (K. U. 17980,

in comparison with a specimen of <i>R. c. chrysopsis</i> in winter pelage
(January 18), from 30 km. E Amecameca, the summer pelage of no.
17980 is more blackish than the winter pelage and therein more
closely resembles that of <i>R. c. seclusus</i>. The same is true of the
more sparsely haired tail. The ears, however, are blackish as in
winter-taken <i>R. c. chrysopsis</i>. This feature and also the large size
and different cranial proportions of specimen no. 17980 are in accordance
with the differences between <i>R. c. chrysopsis</i> and <i>R. c.

sugar cane in tall (5 ft. high) grass growing in a belt 10 feet or so
wide along side a stream, which a person could step across. The
one adult, no. 100597, was recognized at the time of capture as
different from any other species known to us, by reason of the long,
unicolored, sparsely-haired tail and nearly clear Cinnamon Rufous
color above, white underparts, white feet, and dark brown ears. The
four other specimens in darker immature pelage are plumbeous and
cinnamon whereas immature individuals of comparable age of
<i>Peromyscus banderanus</i> caught in the same place are plumbeous
above and lack the cinnamon color. The immature animals of the
two species differ in color more than do the adults. Osgood (1945:300)

we learn that in a manuscript on the deer of the <i>Odocoileus virginianus</i>
group, he and the late Major E. A. Goldman had recorded
specimens, in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States
National Museum, as follows: Nahuatzin, 8,500 ft., nos. 35924/48232,

have not anywhere seen the name combination <i>Odocoileus virginianus

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
