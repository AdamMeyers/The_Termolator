	PREFACE.

	It is unfortunately true that the terms education and
	culture are not synonymous. Too often we find that
	the children in our public schools, while possessed of
	the one, are signally lacking in the other. This is a
	state of things that cannot be remedied by teaching
	mere facts. The Greeks, many years ago, found the
	true method of imparting the latter grace and we shall
	probably not be able to discover a better one to-day.
	Their youths learned Homer and the other great poets
	as a part of their daily tasks, and by thus constantly
	dwelling upon and storing in their minds the noblest
	and most beautifully expressed thought in their literature,
	their own mental life became at once refined and
	strong.

	The basis of all culture lies in a pure and elevated
	moral nature, and so noted an authority as President
	Eliot, of Harvard University, has said that the short
	memory gems which he learned as a boy in school, have
	done him more good in the hour of temptation than all
	the sermons he ever heard preached. A fine thought
	or beautiful image, once stored in the mind, even if at
	first it is received indifferently and with little understanding,
	is bound to recur again and again, and its
	companionship will have a sure, if unconscious, influence.
	The mind that has been filled in youth with
	many such thoughts and images will surely bear fruit
	in fine and gracious actions.

	To the teachers who are persuaded of this truth, the
	present collection of poems has much to recommend it.
	      The selections have been chosen both for their
	moral influence and for their permanent value as literature.
	They have been carefully graded to suit the
	needs of every class from the primary to the high
	school. Either the whole poem or a sufficiently long
	quotation has been inserted to give the child a complete
	mental picture.

	The teacher will thus escape the difficulty of choosing
	among a too great abundance of riches, or the still
	greater one of finding for herself, with few resources,
	what serves her purpose. This volume has a further
	advantage over other books of selections. It is so
	moderate in price that it will be possible to place it in
	the hands of the children themselves.

	The compilers desire to thank Messrs. Houghton,
	Mifflin       Co., Charles Scribner       s Sons, Bowen, Merrill
	      Co., Whittaker       Ray Co., and Doubleday       McClure
	Co., for their kindness in permitting the use of copyrighted
	material.

      GRADED Memory Selections

	FIRST GRADE
	
		THE BABY.
	
	Where did you come from, baby dear?
	Out of the everywhere into the here.
	Where did you get your eyes so blue?
	Out of the sky as I came through.
	

	
	What makes the light in them sparkle and spin?
	Some of the starry spikes left in.
	Where did you get that little tear?
	I found it waiting when I got here.
	

	
	What makes your forehead so smooth and high?
	A soft hand stroked it as I went by.
	What makes your cheek like a warm, white rose?
	I saw something better than any one know.
	

	
	      Whence that three-corner       d smile of bliss?
	Three angels gave me at once a kiss.
	Where did you get this pearly ear?
	God spoke, and it came out to hear.
	

	
	Where did you get those arms and hands?
	Love made itself into hooks and bands.
	Feet, whence did you come, you darling things?
	From the same box as the cherubs        wings.
	

	
	How did they all come just to be you?
	God thought of me and so I grew.
	But how did you come to us, you dear?
	God thought of you, and so I am here.
	
	       George Macdonald.
	
	
		THE LITTLE PLANT.
	
	In the heart of a seed, buried deep, so deep,
	A dear little plant lay fast asleep.
	       Wake,        said the sunshine,        and creep to the light.       
	       Wake,        said the voice of the rain-drops bright.
	The little plant heard and rose to see
	What the wonderful outside world might be.
	
	       Anon.
	
	
		      SLEEP, BABY, SLEEP!
	
	Sleep, baby, sleep!
	Thy father watches his sheep;
	Thy mother is shaking the dreamland tree,
	And down comes a little dream on thee.
	Sleep, baby, sleep!
	

	
	Sleep, baby, sleep!
	The large stars are the sheep;
	The little stars are the lambs, I guess;
	And the gentle moon is the shepherdess.
	Sleep, baby, sleep!
	

	
	Sleep, baby, sleep!
	Our Saviour loves His sheep;
	He is the Lamb of God on high,
	Who for our sakes came down to die.
	Sleep, baby, sleep!
	
	       E. Prentiss (from the German).
	
	
		ONE, TWO, THREE.
	
	One, two, three, a bonny boat I see,
	A silver boat and all afloat upon a rosy sea.
	One, two, three, the riddle tell to me.
	The moon afloat is the bonny boat, the sunset is the sea.
	
	       Margaret Johnson.
	
	
		      THREE LITTLE BUGS IN A BASKET.
	
	Three little bugs in a basket,
	And hardly room for two;
	And one was yellow, and one was black,
	And one like me or you;
	The space was small, no doubt, for all,
	So what should the three bugs do?
	

	
	Three little bugs in a basket,
	And hardly crumbs for two;
	And all were selfish in their hearts,
	The same as I or you.
	So the strong one said,        We will eat the bread,
	And that       s what we will do!       
	

	
	Three little bugs in a basket,
	And the beds but two could hold;
	And so they fell to quarreling       
	The white, the black, and the gold       
	And two of the bugs got under the rugs,
	And one was out in the cold.
	

	
	He that was left in the basket,
	Without a crumb to chew,
	Or a thread to wrap himself withal,
	When the wind across him blew,
	Pulled one of the rugs from one of the bugs,
	And so the quarrel grew.
	

	
	      So there was war in the basket;
	Ah! pity        tis,        tis true!
	But he that was frozen and starved, at last
	A strength from his weakness drew,
	And pulled the rugs from both the bugs,
	And killed and ate them, too!
	

	
	Now when bugs live in a basket,
	Though more than it well can hold,
	It seems to me they had better agree       
	The black, the white, and the gold       
	And share what comes of beds and crumbs,
	And leave no bug in the cold.
	
	       Alice Cary.
	
	
		WHENEVER A LITTLE CHILD IS BORN.
	
	Whenever a little child is born,
	All night a soft wind rocks the corn,
	One more butter-cup wakes to the morn,
	Somewhere.
	One more rose-bud shy will unfold,
	One more grass-blade push through the mould,
	One more bird       s song the air will hold,
	Somewhere.
	
	       Agnes L. Carter.
	
	
		      SWEET AND LOW.
	
	Sweet and low, sweet and low,
	Wind of the western sea,
	Low, low, breathe and blow,
	Wind of the western sea!
	Over the rolling waters go,
	Come from the dying moon, and blow,
	Blow him again to me;
	While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.
	

	
	Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,
	Father will come to thee soon;
	Rest, rest, on mother       s breast,
	Father will come to thee soon;
	Father will come to his babe in the nest,
	Silver sails all out of the west,
	Under the silver moon;
	Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.
	
	       Alfred Tennyson.
	
	
		      THE FERRY FOR SHADOWTOWN.
	
	Sway to and fro in the twilight gray;
	This is the ferry for Shadowtown;
	It always sails at the end of the day,
	Just as the darkness closes down.
	

	
	Rest little head, on my shoulder, so;
	A sleepy kiss is the only fare;
	Drifting away from the world, we go,
	Baby and I in the rocking-chair.
	

	
	See where the fire-logs glow and spark,
	Glitter the lights of the shadowland,
	The raining drops on the window, hark!
	Are ripples lapping upon its strand.
	

	
	There, where the mirror is glancing dim,
	A lake lies shimmering, cool and still.
	Blossoms are waving above its brim,
	Those over there on the window-sill.
	

	
	Rock slow, more slow in the dusky light,
	Silently lower the anchor down:
	Dear little passenger, say        Good-night.       
	We       ve reached the harbor of Shadowtown.
	
	       Anon.
	
	
		      MY SHADOW.
	
	I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
	And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
	He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
	And I see him jump before me when I jump into my bed.
	

	
	The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow       
	Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
	For he sometimes shoots up taller like an India-rubber ball,
	And he sometimes gets so little that there       s none of him at all.
	

	
	He hasn       t got a notion of how children ought to play,
	And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
	He stays so close beside me, he       s a coward, you can see;
	I       d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!
	

	
	      One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
	I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
	But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
	Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.
	
	       Robert Louis Stevenson.
	
	
		QUITE LIKE A STOCKING.
	
	Just as morn was fading amid her misty rings,
	And every stocking was stuffed with childhood       s precious things,
	Old Kris Kringle looked round and saw on the elm tree bough
	High hung, an oriole       s nest, lonely and empty now.
	

	
	       Quite like a stocking,        he laughed,        hung up there in the tree,
	I didn       t suppose the birds expected a visit from me.       
	Then old Kris Kringle who loves a joke as well as the best,
	Dropped a handful of snowflakes into the oriole       s empty nest.
	
	       Anon.
	
	
		      THE OWL AND THE PUSSY-CAT.
	
	The Owl and the Pussy-Cat went to sea
	In a beautiful pea-green boat;
	They took some honey, and plenty of money
	Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
	The Owl looked up to the moon above,
	And sang to a small guitar,
	       O lovely Pussy! O Pussy, my love!
	What a beautiful Pussy you are       
	You are,
	What a beautiful Pussy you are!       
	

	
	Pussy said to the owl,        You elegant fowl!
	How wonderfully sweet you sing!
	Oh, let us be married       too long we have tarried       
	But what shall we do for a ring?       
	They sailed away for a year and a day
	To the land where the Bong-tree grows,
	And there in a wood, a piggy-wig stood
	With a ring in the end of his nose       
	His nose,
	With a ring in the end of his nose.
	

	
	       Dear Pig, are you willing to sell for one shilling
	Your ring?        Said the piggy,        I will.       
	      So they took it away, and were married next day
	By the turkey who lives on the hill.
	They dined upon mince and slices of quince,
	Which they ate with a runcible spoon,
	And hand in hand on the edge of the sand
	They danced by the light of the moon       
	The moon,
	They danced by the light of the moon.

		FORGET-ME-NOT.
	
	When to the flowers so beautiful the Father gave a name
	Back came a little blue-eyed one, all timidly it came;
	And, standing at the Father       s feet and gazing in His face
	It said, in low and trembling tones and with a modest grace,
	       Dear God, the name Thou gavest me, alas, I have forgot.       
	The Father kindly looked Him down and said,        Forget-me-not.

		      WHO STOLE THE BIRD       S NEST.
	
	       To-whit! To-whit! To-whee!
	Will you listen to me?
	Who stole four eggs I laid,
	And the nice nest I made?       
	

	
	       Not I,        said the cow,        moo-oo!
	Such a thing I       d never do.
	I gave you a wisp of hay,
	But I did not take your nest away:
	Not I,        said the cow,        moo-oo!
	Such a thing I       d never do.       
	

	
	       Bob-o-link! Bob-o-link!
	Now, what do you think?
	Who stole a nest away
	From the plum tree to-day?       
	

	
	       Not I,        said the dog,        bow-wow!
	I wouldn       t be so mean, I vow.
	I gave some hairs the nest to make,
	But the nest I did not take.
	Not I,        said the dog,        bow-wow!
	I wouldn       t be so mean, I vow.       
	

	
	       Coo-oo! Coo-coo! Coo-coo!
	Let me speak a word or two:
	Who stole that pretty nest,
	From little Yellow-breast?       
	

	
	             Not I,        said the sheep;        oh, no,
	I would not treat a poor bird so;
	I gave wool the nest to line,
	But the nest was none of mine.
	Baa! Baa!        said the sheep;        oh no;
	I wouldn       t treat a poor bird so.       
	

	
	       Caw! Caw!        cried the crow,
	       I should like to know
	What thief took away
	A bird       s nest to-day.       
	

	
	       Cluck! Cluck!        said the hen,
	       Don       t ask me again;
	Why, I haven       t a chick
	Would do such a trick.
	We all gave her a feather,
	And she wove them together.
	I       d scorn to intrude
	On her and her brood.
	Cluck! Cluck!        said the hen,
	       Don       t ask me again.       
	

	
	       Chirr-a-whirr! Chirr-a-whirr!
	All the birds make a stir.
	Let us find out his name,
	And all cry,        For shame!              
	

	
	             I would not rob a bird!       
	Said little Mary Green,
	       I think I never heard
	Of anything so mean!       
	

	
	       It       s very cruel, too,       
	Said little Alice Neal,
	       I wonder if he knew
	How sad the bird would feel.       
	

	
	A little boy hung down his head,
	And went and hid behind the bed:
	For he stole that pretty nest
	From little Yellow-Breast;
	And he felt so full of shame
	He did not like to tell his name.

	To catch the diamonds gay,
	A million little sunbeams came
	And stole them all away.

	The daisy babies never cry, the nurses never scold;
	They never crush the dainty frills about their cheeks of gold;
	But pure and white, in gay sunlight
	They       re nid-nodding       pretty sight.
	

	
	The daisies love the golden sun, upon the clear blue sky,
	He gazes kindly down on them and winks his jolly eye;
	While soft and low, all in a row,
	Both nurses and babies are nodding JUST SO.

	O moon! in the night I have seen you sailing
	And shining so round and low;
	You were bright, ah bright! but your light is failing,       
	You are nothing now but a bow.
	

	
	You moon, have you done something wrong in heaven,
	That God has hidden your face?
	I hope, if you have, you will soon be forgiven,
	And shine again in your place.

	And Heaven pity the children, wherever their homes may be,
	Who wake at the first gray dawning, an empty stocking to see.

	       Mother, let me fly away.       
	

	
	       Birdie, rest a little longer,
	Till the little wings are stronger.       
	So she rests a little longer,
	Then she flies away.
	

	
	What does little baby say,
	In her bed at peep of day?
	Baby says, like little birdie,
	       Let me rise and fly away.       
	

	
	       Baby, sleep a little longer,
	Till the little limbs are stronger.
	If she sleeps a little longer,
	Baby, too, shall fly away.

	For you to sit and fret?

	And the filmy gnats at their dancing.

	The grasshoppers green and brown,
	And the shining, coal-black crickets.

	And the brooding mother-bird
	With the floating grass above her.

		      THE NIGHT WIND.
	
	Have you ever heard the wind go        Yoooooo       ?
	       Tis a pitiful sound to hear;
	It seems to chill you through and through
	With a strange and speechless fear.
	       Tis the voice of the wind that broods outside
	When folks should be asleep,
	And many and many       s the time I       ve cried
	To the darkness brooding far and wide
	Over the land and the deep:
	       Whom do you want, O lonely night,
	That you wail the long hours through?       
	And the night would say in its ghostly way:
	       Yoooooo! Yoooooooooo! Yoooooooooo!       
	

	
	My mother told me long ago
	When I was a little lad
	That when the night went wailing so,
	Somebody had been bad;
	And then when I was snug in bed,
	Whither I had been sent,
	With the blankets pulled up round my head,
	I       d think of what my mother said,
	And wonder what boy she meant.
	And,        Who       s been bad to-day?        I       d ask
	      Of the wind that hoarsely blew,
	And the voice would say in its meaningful way:
	       Yoooooo! Yoooooooooo! Yoooooooooo!       
	

	
	That this was true, I must allow       
	You       ll not believe it though,
	Yes, though I       m quite a model now,
	I was not always so.
	And if you doubt what things I say,
	Suppose you make the test;
	Suppose that when you       ve been bad some day,
	And up to bed you       re sent away
	From mother and the rest       
	Suppose you ask,        Who has been bad?       
	And then you       ll hear what       s true;
	For the wind will moan in its ruefulest tone:
	       Yoooooo! Yoooooooooo! Yoooooooooo!

		THE BLUE BIRD       S SONG.
	
	Little white snowdrop, I pray you arise:
	Bright yellow crocus, come, open your eyes:
	Sweet little violets hid from the cold,
	Put on your mantles of purple and gold.
	Daffodils, daffodils, say, do you hear?
	Summer is coming and springtime is here.

		      SUPPOSE.
	
	Suppose the little cowslip
	Should hang its golden cup,
	And say,        I       m such a tiny flower,
	I       d better not grow up;       
	How many a weary traveler
	Would miss its fragrant smell,
	And many a little child would grieve
	To lose it from the dell.
	

	
	Suppose the little breezes,
	Upon a summer       s day,
	Should think themselves too small
	To cool the traveler on his way;
	Who would not miss the smallest
	And softest ones that blow,
	And think they made a great mistake,
	If they were talking so?
	

	
	Suppose the little dewdrop
	Upon the grass should say,
	       What can a little dewdrop do?
	I       d better roll away.       
	The blade on which it rested,
	Before the day was done,
	Without a drop to moisten it,
	Would wither in the sun.
	

	
	      How many deeds of kindness
	A little child can do,
	Although it has but little strength,
	And little wisdom, too!
	It wants a loving spirit,
	Much more than strength, to prove
	How many things a child may do
	For others by its love.

		AUTUMN LEAVES.
	
	       Come, little leaves,        said the wind one day;
	       Come over the meadows with me, and play,
	Put on your dresses of red and gold,
	Summer is gone and the days grow cold.       
	

	
	Soon the leaves heard the wind       s loud call,
	Down they fell fluttering, one and all.
	Over the brown fields they danced and flew,
	Singing the soft little songs they knew.
	

	
	Dancing and flying, the little leaves went;
	Winter had called them, and they were content.
	Soon fast asleep in their earthy beds,
	The snow laid a white blanket over their heads.

		      IF I WERE A SUNBEAM.
	
	       If I were a sunbeam,
	I know what I       d do:
	I would seek white lilies
	Rainy woodlands through:
	I would steal among them,
	Softest light I       d shed,
	Until every lily
	Raised its drooping head.
	

	
	       If I were a sunbeam,
	I know where I       d go:
	Into lowliest hovels,
	Dark with want and woe:
	Till sad hearts looked upward,
	I would shine and shine;
	Then they       d think of heaven,
	Their sweet home and mine.       
	

	
	Art thou not a sunbeam,
	Child whose life is glad
	With an inner radiance
	Sunshine never had?
	Oh, as God has blessed thee,
	Scatter rays divine!
	For there is no sunbeam
	But must die, or shine.

		      MEADOW TALK.
	
	A bumble bee, yellow as gold
	Sat perched on a red-clover top,
	When a grasshopper, wiry and old,
	Came along with a skip and a hop.
	       Good morrow        cried he,        Mr. Bumble Bee,
	You seem to have come to stop.       
	

	
	       We people that work,        said the bee with a jerk,
	       Find a benefit sometimes in stopping,
	Only insects like you, who have nothing to do
	Can keep perpetually hopping.       
	The grasshopper paused on his way
	And thoughtfully hunched up his knees:
	       Why trouble this sunshiny day,       
	Quoth he,        with reflections like these?
	I follow the trade for which I was made
	We all can       t be wise bumble-bees;
	There       s a time to be sad and a time to be glad,
	A time for both working and stopping,
	For men to make money, for you to make honey,
	And for me to keep constantly hopping.

		      THE OLD LOVE.
	
	I once had a sweet little doll, dears,
	The prettiest doll in the world;
	Her cheeks were so red and so white, dears,
	And her hair was so charmingly curled:
	But I lost my poor little doll, dears,
	As I played on the heath one day,
	And I cried for her more than a week, dears,
	And I never could find where she lay.
	

	
	I found my poor little doll, dears,
	As I played on the heath one day;
	Folks say she is terribly changed, dears,
	For her paint is all washed away;
	And her arms trodden off by the cows, dears,
	And her hair not the least bit curled:
	Yet for old time       s sake, she is still to me
	The prettiest doll in the world.

		BED IN SUMMER.
	
	In winter I get up at night
	And dress by yellow candle-light.
	In summer, quite the other way,
	I have to go to bed by day.
	

	
	I have to go to bed and see
	The birds still hopping on the tree,
	      Or hear the grown-up people       s feet
	Still going past me in the street.
	

	
	And does it not seem hard to you,
	When all the sky is clear and blue,
	And I should like so much to play,
	To have to go to bed by day?

		THREE COMPANIONS.
	
	We go on our walk together       
	Baby and dog and I       
	Three little merry companions,
	       Neath any sort of sky:
	Blue as our baby       s eyes are,
	Gray like our old dog       s tail;
	Be it windy or cloudy or stormy,
	Our courage will never fail.
	

	
	Baby       s a little lady;
	Dog is a gentleman brave;
	If he had two legs as you have,
	He       d kneel to her like a slave;
	As it is, he loves and protects her,
	As dog and gentleman can.
	I       d rather be a kind doggie,
	I think, than a cruel man.

		      THE WIND.
	
	I saw you toss the kites on high,
	And blow the birds about the sky;
	And all around I heard you pass
	Like ladies        skirts across the grass       
	O wind, a-blowing all day long,
	O wind, that sings so loud a song!
	

	
	I saw the different things you did,
	But always you yourself you hid.
	I felt you push, I heard you call,
	I could not see yourself at all       
	O wind, a-blowing all day long,
	O wind, that sings so loud a song!
	

	
	O you, that are so strong and cold,
	O blower, are you young or old?
	Are you a beast of field and tree,
	Or just a stronger child than me?
	O wind, a-blowing all day long,
	O wind, that sings so loud a song!

		      THE MINUET.1
	
	Grandma told me all about it,
	Told me so I couldn       t doubt it,
	How she danced, my grandma danced; long ago       
	How she held her pretty head,
	How her dainty skirt she spread,
	How she slowly leaned and rose       long ago.
	

	
	Grandma       s hair was bright and sunny,
	Dimpled cheeks, too, oh, how funny!
	Really quite a pretty girl       long ago.
	Bless her! why, she wears a cap,
	Grandma does and takes a nap
	Every single day: and yet
	Grandma danced the minuet       long ago.
	

	
	       Modern ways are quite alarming,       
	Grandma says,        but boys were charming       
	(Girls and boys she means of course)        long ago.       
	Brave but modest, grandly shy;
	She would like to have us try
	Just to feel like those who met
	In the graceful minuet       long ago.

		      WYNKEN, BLYNKEN AND NOD.2
	
	Wynken, Blynken and Nod one night
	Sailed off in a wooden shoe,
	Sailed on a river of crystal light
	Into a sea of dew.
	       Where are you going?               What do you wish?       
	The old Moon asked the three.
	       We come to fish for the herring fish
	That live in the beautiful sea,
	Nets of silver and gold have we,       
	Said Wynken, Blynken and Nod.
	

	
	The old Moon laughed and sang a song
	As they rocked in the wooden shoe,
	And the wind that sped them all night long
	Ruffled the waves of dew.
	The little stars were the herring fish
	That lived in that beautiful sea,       
	       Now cast your nets whenever you wish,
	Never afeard are we!       
	So cried the stars to the fishermen three       
	Wynken, Blynken and Nod.
	

	
	      All night long their nets they threw
	To the stars in the twinkling foam.
	Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
	Bringing the fishermen home.
	       Twas all so pretty a sail it seemed
	As if it could not be,
	And some folks thought        twas a dream they       d dreamed
	Of sailing that beautiful sea.
	But I can name you the fishermen three       
	Wynken, Blynken and Nod.
	

	
	Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
	And Nod is a little head,
	And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
	Is a wee one       s trundle bed.
	So shut your eyes while mother sings
	Of wonderful sights that be,
	And you shall see the beautiful things
	As you rock on the misty sea,       
	Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three       
	Wynken, Blynken and Nod.

		      PRETTY IS THAT PRETTY DOES.
	
	The spider wears a plain brown dress,
	And she is a steady spinner;
	To see her, quiet as a mouse,
	Going about her silver house,
	You would never, never, never guess
	The way she gets her dinner.
	

	
	She looks as if no thought of ill
	In all her life had stirred her;
	But while she moves with careful tread,
	And while she spins her silken thread,
	She is planning, planning, planning still
	The way to do some murder.
	

	
	My child, who reads this simple lay,
	With eyes down-dropt and tender,
	Remember the old proverb says
	That pretty is which pretty does,
	And that worth does not go nor stay
	For poverty nor splendor.
	

	
	       Tis not the house, and not the dress,
	That makes the saint or sinner.
	To see the spider sit and spin,
	Shut with her walls of silver in,
	You would never, never, never guess
	The way she gets her dinner.

		      LULLABY.3
	
	Over the cradle the mother hung,
	Softly crooning a slumber song:
	And these were the simple words she sung
	All the evening long.
	

	
	       Cheek or chin, or knuckle or knee
	Where shall the baby       s dimple be?
	Where shall the angel       s finger rest
	When he comes down to the baby       s nest?
	Where shall the angel       s touch remain
	When he awakens my babe again?       
	

	
	Still as she bent and sang so low,
	A murmur into her music broke:
	And she paused to hear, for she could but know
	The baby       s angel spoke.
	

	
	       Cheek or chin, or knuckle or knee,
	Where shall the baby       s dimple be?
	Where shall my finger fall and rest
	When I come down to the baby       s nest?
	Where shall my finger touch remain
	When I awaken your babe again?       
	

	
	      Silent the mother sat and dwelt
	Long in the sweet delay of choice,
	And then by her baby       s side she knelt,
	And sang with a pleasant voice:
	

	
	       Not on the limb, O angel dear!
	For the charm with its youth will disappear;
	Not on the cheek shall the dimple be,
	For the harboring smile will fade and flee;
	But touch thou the chin with an impress deep,
	And my baby the angel       s seal shall keep.       
	
	       J. G. Holland.

		DISCONTENT.
	
	Down in a field one day in June, the flowers all bloomed together,
	Save one who tried to hide herself, and drooped that pleasant weather.
	A robin who had flown too high, and felt a little lazy,
	Was resting near this buttercup who wished she was a daisy.
	

	
	For daisies grow so slim and tall! She always had a passion
	For wearing frills about her neck in just the daisies        fashion.
	And buttercups must always be the same old tiresome color;
	While daisies dress in gold and white, although their gold is duller.
	

	
	       Dear Robin,        said the sad young flower,        Perhaps you       d not mind trying
	To find a nice white frill for me, some day when you are flying.       
	             You silly thing!        the Robin said,        I think you must be crazy;
	I       d rather be my honest self, than any made-up daisy.
	

	
	       You       re nicer in your own bright gown; the little children love you.
	Be the best buttercup you can, and think no flower above you.
	Though swallows leave me out of sight, we       d better keep our places:
	Perhaps the world would all go wrong with one too many daisies.
	Look bravely up into the sky and be content with knowing
	That God wished for a buttercup, just here where you are growing.

		OUR FLAG.
	
	There are many flags in many lands,
	There are flags of every hue,
	But there is no flag in any land
	Like our own Red, White and Blue.
	I know where the prettiest colors are,
	I       m sure, if I only knew
	How to get them here, I could make a flag
	Of glorious Red, White and Blue.
	

	
	      I would cut a piece from the evening sky
	Where the stars were shining through,
	And use it just as it was on high
	For my stars and field of Blue.
	Then I want a part of a fleecy cloud
	And some red from a rainbow bright,
	And I       d put them together, side by side
	For my stripes of Red and White.
	

	
	Then        Hurrah for the Flag!        our country       s flag,
	Its stripes and white stars too;
	There is no flag in any land
	Like our own        Red, White and Blue.

		SONG FROM        PIPPA PASSES.       
	
	The year       s at the spring,
	And day       s at the morn;
	Morning       s at seven;
	The hill-side       s dew-pearled;
	The lark       s on the wing;
	The snail       s on the thorn:
	God       s in his heaven       
	All       s right with the world.
	
	       Robert Browning.
	
	
		      LITTLE BROWN HANDS.
	
	They drive home the cows from the pasture,
	Up through the long shady lane,
	Where the quail whistles loud in the wheat-fields,
	That are yellow with ripening grain.
	They find, in the thick, waving grasses,
	Where the scarlet-lipped strawberry grows.
	They gather the earliest snowdrops,
	And the first crimson buds of the rose.
	

	
	They toss the new hay in the meadow;
	They gather the elder-bloom white;
	They find where the dusky grapes purple
	In the soft-tinted October light.
	They know where the apples hang ripest,
	And are sweeter than Italy       s wines;
	They know where the fruit hangs the thickest
	On the long, thorny blackberry-vines.
	

	
	They gather the delicate sea-weeds,
	And build tiny castles of sand;
	They pick up the beautiful sea-shells       
	Fairy barks that have drifted to land.
	They wave from the tall, rocking tree-tops
	Where the oriole       s hammock-nest swings;
	And at night-time are folded in slumber
	By a song that a fond mother sings.
	

	
	      Those who toil bravely are strongest;
	The humble and poor become great;
	And so from these brown-handed children
	Shall grow mighty rulers of state.
	The pen of the author and statesman       
	The noble and wise of the land       
	The sword, and the chisel, and palette,
	Shall be held in the little brown hand.

		WINTER AND SUMMER.
	
	Oh, I wish the Winter would go,
	And I wish the Summer would come,
	Then the big brown farmers will hoe,
	And the little brown bee will hum.
	

	
	Then the robin his fife will trill,
	And the wood-piper beat his drum;
	And out of their tents on the hill
	The little green troops will come.
	

	
	Then around and over the trees
	With a flutter and flirt we       ll go,
	A rollicking, frolicking breeze,
	And away with a frisk ho! ho!

		      THE BROOK.
	
	I come from haunts of coot and hern,
	I make a sudden sally,
	And sparkle out among the fern,
	To bicker down the valley.
	

	
	By thirty hills I hurry down,
	Or slip between the ridges,
	By twenty thorps, a little town,
	And half a hundred bridges.
	

	
	Till last by Philip       s farm I flow
	To join the brimming river;
	For men may come, and men may go,
	But I go on forever.
	

	
	I chatter over stony ways,
	In little sharps and trebles;
	I bubble into eddying bays;
	I babble on the pebbles.
	

	
	With many a curve my bank I fret
	By many a field and fallow,
	And many a fairy foreland set
	With willow-weed and mallow.
	

	
	I chatter, chatter as I flow
	To join the brimming river,
	      For men may come, and men may go,
	But I go on forever.
	

	
	I wind about, and in and out,
	With here a blossom sailing,
	And here and there a lusty trout,
	And here and there a grayling,
	

	
	And here and there a foamy flake
	Upon me as I travel,
	With many a silvery waterbreak
	Above the golden gravel,
	

	
	And draw them all along and flow
	To join the brimming river,
	For men may come, and men may go,
	But I go on forever.
	

	
	I steal by lawns and grassy plots,
	I slide by hazel covers,
	I move the sweet forget-me-nots
	That grow for happy lovers.
	

	
	I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,
	Among my skimming swallows;
	I make the netted sunbeam dance
	Against my sandy shallows.
	

	
	I murmur under moon and stars
	In brambly wildernesses;
	      I linger by my shingly bars;
	I loiter round my cresses;
	

	
	And out again I curve and flow
	To join the brimming river,
	For men may come and men may go
	But I go on forever.
	
	       Tennyson.
	
	
		THE WONDERFUL WORLD.
	
	Great, wide, beautiful, wonderful World,
	With the wonderful water around you curled,
	And the wonderful grass upon your breast       
	World, you are beautifully dressed.
	

	
	The wonderful air is over me,
	And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree,
	It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,
	And talks to itself on the tops of the hills.
	

	
	You, friendly Earth, how far do you go,
	With the wheatfields that nod and the rivers that flow,
	With cities and gardens, and cliffs, and isles,
	And people upon you for thousands of miles?
	

	
	Ah, you are so great, and I am so small,
	I tremble to think of you, World, at all;
	And yet, when I said my prayers, to-day,
	      A whisper inside me seemed to say,
	       You are more than the earth, though you are such a dot:
	You can love and think, and the Earth can not!       
	
	       W. B. Rands.
	
	
		DON       T GIVE UP.
	
	If you       ve tried and have not won,
	Never stop for crying;
	All that       s great and good is done
	Just by patient trying.
	

	
	Though young birds, in flying, fall,
	Still their wings grow stronger;
	And the next time they can keep
	Up a little longer.
	

	
	Though the sturdy oak has known
	Many a blast that bowed her,
	She has risen again, and grown
	Loftier and prouder.
	

	
	If by easy work you beat,
	Who the more will prize you?
	Gaining victory from defeat,
	That       s the test that tries you!

		      WE ARE SEVEN.
	
	       A simple child,
	That lightly draws its breath,
	And feels its life in every limb,
	What should it know of death?
	

	
	I met a little cottage girl:
	She was eight years old, she said;
	Her hair was thick with many a curl
	That clustered round her head.
	

	
	She had a rustic, woodland air,
	And she was wildly clad:
	Her eyes were fair, and very fair       
	Her beauty made me glad.
	

	
	       Sisters and brothers, little Maid,
	How many may you be?       
	       How many? Seven in all,        she said,
	And wondering looked at me.
	

	
	       And where are they? I pray you tell.       
	She answered,        Seven are we;
	And two of us at Conway dwell,
	And two are gone to sea.
	

	
	       Two of us in the churchyard lie,
	My sister and my brother;
	      And in the churchyard cottage, I
	Dwell near them with my mother.       
	

	
	       You say that two at Conway dwell,
	And two are gone to sea,
	Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell,
	Sweet Maid, how this may be.       
	

	
	Then did the little maid reply,
	       Seven boys and girls are we;
	Two of us in the churchyard lie,
	Beneath the churchyard tree.       
	

	
	       You run about, my little Maid,
	Your limbs they are alive;
	If two are in the churchyard laid
	Then ye are only five.       
	

	
	       Their graves are green, they may be seen,       
	The little Maid replied,
	       Twelve steps or more from my mother       s door,
	And they are side by side.
	

	
	       My stockings there I often knit,
	My kerchief there I hem;
	And there upon the ground I sit
	And sing a song to them.
	

	
	             And often after sunset, sir,
	When it is light and fair,
	I take my little porringer,
	And eat my supper there.
	

	
	       The first that died was sister Jane;
	In bed she moaning lay,
	Till God released her of her pain;
	And then she went away.
	

	
	       So in the churchyard she was laid;
	And when the grass was dry,
	Together round her grave we played,
	My brother John and I.
	

	
	       And when the ground was white with snow
	And I could run and slide,
	My brother John was forced to go,
	And he lies by her side.       
	

	
	       How many are you, then,        said I,
	       If they two are in heaven?       
	Quick was the little Maid       s reply,
	       O master! we are seven.       
	

	
	       But they are dead; those two are dead!
	Their spirits are in heaven!       
	             Twas throwing words away: for still
	The little Maid would have her will,
	And said,        Nay, we are seven!       
	
	       Wordsworth.
	
	
		THE LAND OF COUNTERPANE.
	
	When I was sick and lay abed,
	I had two pillows at my head,
	And all my toys beside me lay
	To keep me happy all the day.
	

	
	And sometimes for an hour or so
	I watched my leaden soldiers go,
	With different uniforms and drills,
	Among the bedclothes, through the hills;
	

	
	And sometimes sent my ships in fleets
	All up and down among the sheets;
	Or brought my trees and houses out,
	And planted cities all about.
	

	
	I was the giant great and still,
	That sits upon the pillow-hill,
	And sees before him, dale and plain,
	The pleasant land of counterpane.
	
	       Robert Louis Stevenson.
	
	
		      THE BROWN THRUSH.
	
	There       s a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree,
	       He       s singing to me! He       s singing to me!       
	And what does he say, little girl, little boy?
	       Oh, the world       s running over with joy!
	Don       t you hear? Don       t you see?
	Hush! Look! In my tree,
	I       m as happy as happy can be!       
	

	
	And the brown thrush keeps singing,        A nest do you see,
	And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?
	Don       t meddle! Don       t touch! little girl, little boy,
	Or the world will lose some of its joy!
	Now I       m glad! Now I       m free!
	And I always shall be,
	If you never bring sorrow to me.       
	

	
	So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,
	To you and to me, to you and to me:
	And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,
	       Oh, the world       s running over with joy!
	But long it won       t be,
	      Don       t you know? don       t you see?
	Unless we are as good as can be!

		THE SILVER BOAT.
	
	There is a boat upon a sea;
	It never stops for you or me.
	The sea is blue, the boat is white;
	It sails through winter and summer night.
	

	
	The swarthy child in India land
	Points to the prow with eager hand;
	The little Lapland babies cry
	For the silver boat a-sailing by.
	

	
	It fears no gale, it fears no wreck;
	It never meets a change or check
	Through weather fine or weather wild.
	The oldest saw it when a child.
	

	
	Upon another sea below
	Full many vessels come and go;
	Upon the swaying, swinging tide
	Into the distant worlds they ride.
	

	
	And strange to tell, the sea below,
	Where countless vessels come and go,
	Obeys the little boat on high
	Through all the centuries sailing by.

		      THE DANDELION.
	
	Bright little dandelion,
	Downy, yellow face,
	Peeping up among the grass
	With such gentle grace;
	Minding not the April wind
	Blowing rude and cold;
	Brave little dandelion,
	With a heart of gold.
	

	
	Meek little dandelion,
	Changing into curls
	At the magic touch of these
	Merry boys and girls.
	When they pinch thy dainty throat,
	Strip thy dress of green,
	On thy soft and gentle face
	Not a cloud is seen.
	

	
	Poor little dandelion,
	Now all gone to seed,
	Scattered roughly by the wind
	Like a common weed.
	Thou hast lived thy little life
	Smiling every day;
	Who could do a better thing
	In a better way?

	      AFTERNOON IN FEBRUARY.
	
	The day is ending,
	The night is descending;
	The marsh is frozen,
	The river dead.
	

	
	Through clouds like ashes,
	The red sun flashes
	On village windows
	That glimmer red.
	

	
	The snow recommences;
	The buried fences
	Mark no longer
	The road o       er the plain;
	

	
	While through the meadows,
	Like fearful shadows,
	Slowly passes
	A funeral train.
	

	
	The bell is pealing,
	And every feeling
	Within me responds
	To the dismal knell.
	

	
	Shadows are trailing,
	My heart is bewailing
	And tolling within
	Like a funeral bell.

		      NIKOLINA.4
	
	Oh, tell me, little children, have you seen her       
	The tiny maid from Norway, Nikolina?
	Oh, her eyes are blue as corn-flowers        mid the corn,
	And her cheeks are rosy red as skies of morn.
	

	
	Oh, buy the baby       s blossoms if you meet her,
	And stay with gentle looks and words to greet her;
	She       ll gaze at you and smile and clasp your hand,
	But not one word of yours can understand.
	

	
	       Nikolina!        Swift she turns if any call her,
	As she stands among the poppies, hardly taller;
	Breaking off their flaming scarlet cups for you,
	With spikes of slender larkspur, brightly blue.
	

	
	In her little garden many a flower is growing       
	Red, gold and purple, in the soft wind blowing;
	But the child that stands amid the blossoms gay
	Is sweeter, quainter, brighter, lovelier even than they.
	

	
	      Oh, tell me, little children, have you seen her       
	This baby girl from Norway, Nikolina?
	Slowly she       s learning English words to try
	And thank you if her flowers you buy.

		LOST!5
	
	       Lock the dairy door!        Oh, hark, the cock is crowing proudly!
	       Lock the dairy door!        and all the hens are cackling loudly.
	       Chickle, chackle, chee!        they cry;        we haven       t got the key,        they cry,
	       Chickle, chackle, chee! Oh, dear! wherever can it be?        they cry.
	

	
	Up and down the garden walks where all the flowers are blowing,
	Out about the golden fields where tall the wheat is growing,
	Through the barn and up the road, they cackle and they clatter;
	Cry the children,        Hear the hens! Why, what can be the matter?       
	

	
	      What scraping and what scratching, what bristling and what hustling,
	The cock stands on the fence, the wind his ruddy plumage rustling.
	Like a soldier grand he stands, and like a trumpet glorious,
	Sounds his shout both far and near, imperious and victorious.
	

	
	But to the Partlets down below who cannot find the key, they hear,
	       Lock the dairy door;        that       s all his challenge says to them, my dear.
	Why they had it, how they lost it, must remain a mystery;
	I that tell you, never heard the first part of the history.
	

	
	But if you listen, dear, next time the cock crows proudly
	       Lock the dairy door!        you       ll hear him tell the biddies loudly:
	       Chickle, chackle, chee!        they cry;        we haven       t got the key!        they cry;
	       Chickle, chackle, chee! Oh, dear! wherever can it be?        they cry.

		      ROBIN OR I?6
	
	Robin comes with early spring,
	Dressed up in his very best;
	Very pretty is his suit       
	Brownish coat and reddish vest.
	

	
	Robin takes my cherry tree
	For his very, very own;
	Never asking if he may       
	There he makes his dainty home.
	

	
	Robin eats my cherries, too,
	In an open, shameless way;
	Feeds his wife and babies three       
	Giving only songs for pay.
	

	
	Bolder thief than robin is
	Would be hard, indeed, to find;
	But he sings so sweet a tune
	That I really do not mind!
	

	
	       Cheer up! Cheer up!        Robin sings;
	       Cheer up! Cheer up!        all day long;
	Shine or shower, all the same,
	       Cheer up! Cheer up!        is his song.
	

	
	      Eating, singing, Robin lives
	There within my cherry tree;
	When I call him        robber!               thief!       
	Back he flings a song to me!
	

	
	       May I have some cherries, please?       
	Robin never thinks to say;
	Yet, who has the heart       have you?
	Saucy Rob to drive away?
	
	       Sarah E. Sprague.

		PSALM XXIII.
	
	The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not
	want.
	He maketh me to lie down in green
	pastures: He leadeth me beside the still
	waters.
	He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in
	the paths of righteousness for His name       s
	sake.
	Yea, though I walk through the valley of
	the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:
	for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy
	staff they comfort me.
	Thou preparest a table before me in the
	presence of mine enemies; Thou anointest
	my head with oil; my cup runneth
	over.
	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
	me all the days of my life; and I will
	dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

		      THE MOUNTAIN AND THE SQUIRREL.
	
	The Mountain and the Squirrel
	Had a quarrel,
	And the former called the latter        Little Prig.       
	

	
	Bun replied:
	       You are doubtless very big;
	But all sorts of things and weather
	Must be taken in together,
	To make up a year,
	And a sphere;
	

	
	And I think it no disgrace
	To occupy my place.
	If I       m not so large as you,
	You       re not so small as I,
	And not half so spry.
	

	
	I       ll not deny you make
	A very pretty squirrel track.
	Talents differ; all is well and wisely put:
	If I cannot carry forests on my back,
	Neither can you crack a nut.       
	
	       Ralph Waldo Emerson.
	
	
		      ABOU BEN ADHEM.
	
	Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
	Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
	And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
	Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,
	An angel writing in a book of gold;
	Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
	And to the presence in the room he said,
	       What writest thou?        The vision raised its head,
	And, with a look made of all sweet accord,
	Answered,        The names of those who love the Lord.       
	       And is mine one?        said Abou.        Nay, not so,       
	Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,
	But cheerly still; and said,        I pray thee, then,
	Write me as one who loves his fellow-men.       
	

	
	The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night
	It came again, with a great wakening light,
	And showed the names whom love of God had blest;
	And, lo! Ben Adhem       s name led all the rest.
	
	       James Henry Leigh Hunt.
	
	
		      BUGLE SONG.
	
	The splendor falls on castle walls
	And snowy summits old in story;
	The long light shakes across the lakes,
	And the wild cataract leaps in glory.
	Blow, bugle, blow! set the wild echoes flying;
	Blow, bugle; answer, echoes       dying, dying, dying!
	

	
	O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,
	And thinner, clearer, farther going!
	O sweet and far, from cliff and scar,
	The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!
	Blow! let us hear the purple glens replying;
	Blow, bugle; answer, echoes       dying, dying, dying!
	

	
	O love! they die in yon rich sky:
	They faint on hill, or field or river;
	Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
	And grow forever and forever.
	Blow, bugle, blow! set the wild echoes flying;
	And answer, echoes, answer       dying, dying, dying.
	
	       Tennyson.
	
	
		      LITTLE BOY BLUE.7
	
	The little toy dog is covered with dust,
	But sturdy and stanch he stands;
	And the little toy soldier is red with rust,
	And his musket moulds in his hands.
	Time was when the little toy dog was new,
	And the soldier was passing fair;
	And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue
	Kissed them and put them there.
	

	
	       Now, don       t you go till I come,        he said;
	       And don       t you make any noise!       
	So toddling off to his trundle-bed
	He dreamed of the pretty toys;
	And as he was dreaming, an angel       s song
	Awakened our Little Boy Blue       
	Oh, the years are many, the years are long,
	But the little toy friends are true.
	

	
	Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand,
	Each in the same old place,
	Awaiting the touch of a little hand,
	The smile of a little face.
	And they wonder, as waiting these long years through,
	      In the dust of that little chair,
	What has become of our Little Boy Blue
	Since he kissed them and put them there.
	
	       Eugene Field.
	
	
		PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE.8
	
	All day long they come and go       
	Pittypat and Tippytoe;
	Footprints up and down the hall;
	Playthings scattered on the floor,
	Finger marks along the wall,
	Tell-tale smudges on the door;       
	By these presents you shall know
	Pittypat and Tippytoe.
	

	
	How they riot at their play;
	And a dozen times a day
	In they troop demanding bread       
	Only buttered bread will do,
	And that butter must be spread
	Inches thick, with sugar, too;
	And I never can say        No,
	Pittypat and Tippytoe.       
	

	
	      Sometimes there are griefs to soothe,
	Sometimes ruffled brows to smooth,
	For (I much regret to say)
	Tippytoe and Pittypat
	Sometimes interrupt their play
	With an internecine spat;
	Fie, for shame; to quarrel so       
	Pittypat and Tippytoe.
	

	
	Oh, the thousand worrying things
	Every day recurrent brings;
	Hands to scrub and hair to brush,
	Search for playthings gone amiss,
	Many a wee complaint to hush,
	Many a little bump to kiss;
	Life seems one vain fleeting show
	To Pittypat and Tippytoe.
	

	
	And when day is at an end
	There are little duds to mend;
	Little frocks are strangely torn,
	Little shoes great holes reveal,
	Little hose but one day worn,
	Rudely yawn at toe and heel;
	Who but you could work such woe,
	Pittypat and Tippytoe?
	

	
	      But when comes this thought to me
	       Some there are who childless be,       
	Stealing to their little beds,
	With a love I cannot speak,
	Tenderly I stroke their heads       
	Fondly kiss each velvet cheek.
	God help those who do not know
	A Pittypat and Tippytoe.
	

	
	On the floor and down the hall,
	Rudely smutched upon the wall,
	There are proofs of every kind
	Of the havoc they have wrought;
	And upon my heart you       d find
	Just such trade marks, if you sought;
	Oh, how glad I am        tis so,
	Pittypat and Tippytoe.
	
	       Eugene Field.
	
	
		      RED RIDING-HOOD.9
	
	On the wide lawn the snow lay deep,
	Ridged o       er with many a drifty heap;
	The wind that through the pine trees sung
	The naked elm-boughs tossed and swung;
	While through the window, frosty-starred,
	Against the sunset purple barr       d,
	We saw the somber crow flit by,
	The hawks gray flock along the sky,
	The crested blue-jay flitting swift,
	The squirrel poising on the drift,
	Erect, alert, his broad gray tail,
	Set to the north wind like a sail.
	

	
	It came to pass, our little lass,
	With flattened face against the glass,
	And eyes in which the tender dew
	Of pity shone, stood gazing through
	The narrow space her rosy lips
	Had melted from the frost       s eclipse.
	       Oh, see!        she cried,        The poor blue-jays!
	What is it that the black crow says?
	The squirrel lifts his little legs
	Because he has no hands, and begs;
	He       s asking for nuts, I know;
	May I not feed them on the snow?       
	

	
	      Half lost within her boots, her head
	Warm-sheltered in her hood of red,
	Her plaid skirt close about her drawn,
	She floundered down the wintry lawn;
	Now struggling through the misty veil
	Blown round her by the shrieking gale;
	Now sinking in a drift so low
	Her scarlet hood could scarcely show
	Its dash of color on the snow.
	

	
	She dropped for bird and beast forlorn
	Her little store of nuts and corn,
	And thus her timid guests bespoke:
	       Come, squirrel, from your hollow oak       
	Come, black old crow; come, poor blue-jay,
	Before your supper       s blown away!
	Don       t be afraid, we all are good!
	And I       m mamma       s Red Riding-Hood!       
	

	
	O Thou whose care is over all,
	Who heedest even the sparrow       s fall,
	Keep in the little maiden       s breast
	The pity, which is now its guest!
	Let not her cultured years make less
	The childhood charm of tenderness.
	But let her feel as well as know,
	Nor harder with her polish grow!
	Unmoved by sentimental grief
	      That wails along some printed leaf,
	But, prompt with kindly word and deed
	To own the claims of all who need,
	Let the grown woman       s self make good
	The promise of Red Riding-Hood!
	
	       Whittier.
	
	
		THE SANDPIPER AND I.10
	
	Across the lonely beach we flit,
	One little sandpiper and I,
	And fast I gather, bit by bit,
	The scattered driftwood, bleached and  dry.
	The wild waves reach their hands for it,
	The wild wind raves, the tide runs high,
	As up and down the beach we flit,
	One little sandpiper and I.
	

	
	I watch him as he skims along,
	Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;
	He starts not at my fitful song,
	Nor flash of fluttering drapery.
	He has no thought of any wrong,
	He scans me with a fearless eye;
	      Stanch friends are we, well-tried and strong,
	The little sandpiper and I.
	

	
	Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,
	When the loosed storm breaks furiously?
	My driftwood fire will burn so bright!
	To what warm shelter can       st thou fly?
	I do not fear for thee, though wroth
	The tempest rushes through the sky;
	For are we not God       s children, both,
	Thou, little sandpiper, and I?
	
	       Celia Thaxter.
	
	
		IN SCHOOL DAYS.1
	
	Still sits the school-house by the road,
	A ragged beggar sleeping;
	Around it still the sumachs grow
	And blackberry vines are creeping.
	

	
	Within, the master       s desk is seen,
	Deep-scarred by raps official;
	The warping floor, the battered seats,
	The jack-knife       s carved initial.
	

	
	      The charcoal frescoes on the wall,
	Its door       s worn sill, betraying
	The feet that, creeping slow to school,
	Went storming out to playing.
	

	
	Long years ago a winter       s sun
	Shone over it at setting;
	Lit up its western window-panes,
	And low eaves        icy fretting.
	

	
	It touched the tangled golden curls,
	And brown eyes full of grieving
	Of one who still her steps delayed,
	When all the school were leaving.
	

	
	For near her stood the little boy
	Her childish favor singled;
	His cap pulled low upon his face
	Where pride and shame were mingled.
	

	
	Pushing with restless feet the snow
	To right, to left, he lingered       
	As restlessly her tiny hands
	The blue-checked apron fingered.
	

	
	He saw her lift her eyes; he felt
	The soft hand       s light caressing,
	And heard the tremble of her voice,
	As if a fault confessing.
	

	
	             I       m sorry that I spelt the word,
	I hate to go above you,
	Because              the brown eyes lower fell       
	       Because, you see, I love you.       
	

	
	Still memory to a gray-haired man
	That sweet child-face is showing.
	Dear girl! the grasses on her grave
	Have forty years been growing.
	

	
	He lives to learn in life       s hard school
	How few who pass above him
	Lament their triumph and his loss,
	Like her       because they love him.
	
	       Whittier.
	
	
		TAKE CARE.
	
	Little children, you must seek
	Rather to be good than wise,
	For the thoughts you do not speak
	Shine out in your cheeks and eyes.
	

	
	If you think that you can be
	Cross and cruel and look fair,
	Let me tell you how to see
	You are quite mistaken there.
	

	
	      Go and stand before the glass,
	And some ugly thought contrive,
	And my word will come to pass
	Just as sure as you       re alive!
	

	
	What you have and what you lack,
	All the same as what you wear,
	You will see reflected back;
	So, my little folks, take care!
	

	
	And not only in the glass
	Will your secrets come to view;
	All beholders, as they pass,
	Will perceive and know them, too.
	

	
	Goodness shows in blushes bright,
	Or in eyelids dropping down,
	Like a violet from the light;
	Badness in a sneer or frown.
	

	
	Out of sight, my boys and girls,
	Every root of beauty starts;
	So think less about your curls,
	More about your minds and hearts.
	

	
	Cherish what is good, and drive
	Evil thoughts and feelings far;
	For, as sure as you       re alive,
	You will show for what you are.
	
	       Alice Cary.
	
	
		      A LIFE LESSON.12
	
	There! little girl; don       t cry!
	They have broken your doll, I know;
	And your tea-set blue,
	And your play-house, too,
	Are things of the long ago;
	But childish troubles will soon pass by.
	There! little girl; don       t cry!
	

	
	There! little girl; don       t cry!
	They have broken your slate, I know;
	And the glad wild ways
	Of your school-girl days
	Are things of the long ago;
	But life and love will soon come by.
	There! little girl; don       t cry!
	

	
	There! little girl; don       t cry!
	They have broken your heart, I know;
	And the rainbow gleams
	Of your youthful dreams
	Are things of the long ago;
	But heaven holds all for which you sigh.
	There! little girl; don       t cry!
	
	       James Whitcomb Riley.
	


	      FIFTH GRADE
	
		THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.
	
	Under a spreading chestnut-tree
	The village smithy stands;
	The smith, a mighty man is he,
	With large and sinewy hands;
	And the muscles of his brawny arms
	Are strong as iron bands.
	

	
	His hair is crisp, and black, and long;
	His face is like the tan;
	His brow is wet with honest sweat;
	He earns whate       er he can,
	And looks the whole world in the face,
	For he owes not any man.
	

	
	Week in, week out, from morn to night,
	You can hear his bellows blow;
	You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,
	With measured beat and slow,
	Like a sexton ringing the village bell
	When the evening sun is low.
	

	
	      And children, coming home from school,
	Look in at the open door;
	They love to see the flaming forge,
	And hear the bellows roar,
	And catch the burning sparks that fly
	Like chaff from a threshing-floor.
	

	
	He goes on Sunday to the church,
	And sits among his boys;
	He hears the parson pray and preach,
	He hears his daughter       s voice
	Singing in the village choir,
	And it makes his heart rejoice.
	

	
	It sounds to him like her mother       s voice,
	Singing in Paradise!
	He needs must think of her once more       
	How in the grave she lies;
	And, with his hard, rough hand, he wipes
	A tear out of his eyes.
	

	
	Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,
	Onward through life he goes;
	Each morning sees some task begin,
	Each evening sees its close;
	Something attempted, something done,
	Has earned a night       s repose.
	

	
	      Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,
	For the lesson thou hast taught!
	Thus at the flaming forge of life,
	Our fortunes must be wrought;
	Thus, on its sounding anvil, shaped
	Each burning deed and thought!
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		LOVE OF COUNTRY
	
	Breathes there a man with soul so dead,
	Who never to himself hath said,
	This is my own, my native land!
	Whose heart hath ne       er within him burn       d,
	As home his footsteps he hath turn       d,
	From wandering on a foreign strand!
	If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
	For him no Minstrel raptures swell;
	High though his titles, proud his name,
	Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;
	Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
	The wretch, concenter       d all in self,
	Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
	And doubly dying, shall go down
	To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,
	Unwept, unhonor       d, and unsung.
	
	       Scott.
	
	
		      THE DAFFODILS.
	
	I wandered lonely as a cloud
	That floats on high o       er vales and hills,
	When all at once I saw a crowd,
	A host, of golden daffodils;
	Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
	Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
	

	
	Continuous as the stars that shine
	And twinkle on the milky way,
	They stretched in never-ending line
	Along the margin of a bay:
	Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
	Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
	

	
	The waves beside them danced; but they
	Outdid the sparkling waves in glee:
	A poet could not but be gay,
	In such a jocund company:
	I gazed       and gazed       but little thought
	What wealth the show to me had brought:
	

	
	For oft, when on my couch I lie
	In vacant or in pensive mood,
	They flash upon that inward eye
	Which is the bliss of solitude;
	And then my heart with pleasure fills,
	And dances with the daffodils.
	
	       Wordsworth.
	
	
		      A CHILD       S THOUGHT OF GOD.
	
	They say that God lives very high:
	But if you look above the pines
	You cannot see God. And why?
	

	
	And if you dig down in the mines
	You never see him in the gold,
	Though, from him, all that       s glory shines.
	

	
	God is so good, he wears a fold
	Of heaven and earth across his face       
	Like secrets kept for love untold.
	

	
	But still I feel that his embrace
	Slides down by thrills, through all things made,
	Through sight and sound of every place:
	

	
	As if my tender mother laid
	On my shut lids her kisses        pressure,
	Half waking me at night; and said,
	       Who kissed you through the dark, dear guesser?       
	
	       Mrs. Browning.
	
	
		      FROM MY ARM-CHAIR.13
	
	Am I a king that I should call my own
	This splendid ebon throne?
	Or by what reason or what right divine,
	Can I proclaim it mine?
	

	
	Only, perhaps, by right divine of song
	It may to me belong:
	Only because the spreading chestnut tree
	Of old was sung by me.
	

	
	Well I remember it in all its prime,
	When in the summer time
	The affluent foliage of its branches made
	A cavern of cool shade.
	

	
	There by the blacksmith       s forge, beside the street,
	Its blossoms white and sweet
	Enticed the bees, until it seemed alive,
	And murmured like a hive.
	

	
	And when the winds of autumn, with a shout,
	Tossed its great arms about,
	The shining chestnuts, bursting from the sheath,
	Dropped to the ground beneath.
	

	
	      And now some fragments of its branches bare,
	Shaped as a stately chair,
	Have, by a hearth-stone found a home at last,
	And whisper of the past.
	

	
	The Danish king could not in all his pride
	Repel the ocean tide.
	But, seated in this chair,
	I can in rhyme
	Roll back the tide of time.
	

	
	I see again, as one in vision sees,
	The blossoms and the bees,
	And hear the children       s voices call,
	And the brown chestnuts fall.
	

	
	I see the smithy with its fires aglow,
	I hear the bellows blow,
	And the shrill hammers on the anvil beat
	The iron white with heat.
	

	
	And thus, dear children, have ye made for me
	This day a jubilee,
	And to my more than three-score years and ten
	Brought back my youth again.
	

	
	      The heart hath its own memory, like the mind
	And in it are enshrined
	The precious keepsakes, into which is wrought
	The giver       s loving thought.
	

	
	Only your love and your remembrance could
	Give life to this dead wood,
	And make these branches, leafless now so long,
	Blossom again in song.
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		A SONG OF EASTER.14
	
	Sing, children, sing,
	And the lily censers swing;
	Sing that life and joy are waking and that
	Death no more is king.
	Sing the happy, happy tumult of the slowly bright       ning Spring;
	Sing, little children, sing,
	Sing, children, sing,
	Winter wild has taken wing.
	

	
	      Fill the air with the sweet tidings till the frosty echoes ring.
	Along the eaves, the icicles no longer cling;
	And the crocus in the garden lifts its bright face to the sun;
	And in the meadow, softly the brooks begin to run;
	And the golden catkins, swing
	In the warm air of the Spring       
	Sing, little children, sing.
	

	
	Sing, children, sing,
	The lilies white you bring
	In the joyous Easter morning, for hopes are blossoming,
	And as earth her shroud of snow from off her breast doth fling,
	So may we cast our fetters off in God       s eternal Spring;
	So may we find release at last from sorrow and from pain,
	Soon may we find our childhood       s calm, delicious dawn again.
	Sweet are your eyes, O little ones, that look with smiling grace,
	Without a shade of doubt or fear into the future       s face.
	

	
	      Sing, sing in happy chorus, with happy voices tell
	That death is life, and God is good, and all things shall be well.
	That bitter day shall cease
	In warmth and light and peace,
	That winter yields to Spring       
	Sing, little children, sing.

		THE JOY OF THE HILLS.15
	
	I ride on the mountain tops, I ride;
	I have found my life and am satisfied.
	Onward I ride in the blowing oats,
	Checking the field lark       s rippling notes       
	Lightly I sweep from steep to steep;
	O       er my head through branches high
	Come glimpses of deep blue sky;
	The tall oats brush my horse       s flanks:
	Wild poppies crowd on the sunny banks;
	A bee booms out of the scented grass;
	A jay laughs with me as I pass.
	

	
	I ride on the hills, I forgive, I forget
	Life       s hoard of regret       
	All the terror and pain of a chafing chain.
	      Grind on, O cities, grind! I leave you a blur behind.
	I am lifted elate       the skies expand;
	Here the world       s heaped gold is a pile of sand.
	Let them weary and work in their narrow walls;
	I ride with the voices of waterfalls.
	I swing on as one in a dream       I swing.
	Down the very hollows, I shout, I sing.
	The world is gone like an empty word;
	My body       s a bough in the wind,       my heart a bird.
	
	       Edwin Markham.
	
	
		IN BLOSSOM TIME.
	
	Its O my heart, my heart,
	To be out in the sun and sing,
	To sing and shout in the fields about,
	In the balm and blossoming.
	

	
	Sing loud, O bird in the tree;
	O bird, sing loud in the sky,
	And honey-bees, blacken the clover-beds;
	There are none of you as glad as I.
	

	
	      The leaves laugh low in the wind,
	Laugh low with the wind at play;
	And the odorous call of the flowers all
	Entices my soul away.
	

	
	For oh, but the world is fair, is fair,
	And oh, but the world is sweet;
	I will out in the old of the blossoming mould,
	And sit at the Master       s feet.
	

	
	And the love my heart would speak,
	I will fold in the lily       s rim,
	That the lips of the blossom more pure and meek
	May offer it up to Him.
	

	
	Then sing in the hedgerow green, O thrush,
	O skylark, sing in the blue;
	Sing loud, sing clear, that the King may hear,
	And my soul shall sing with you.
	
	       Ina Coolbrith.
	
	
		      THE STARS AND THE FLOWERS.16
	
	Spake full well, in language quaint and olden,
	One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine,
	When he called the flowers so blue and golden
	Stars that in earth       s firmament do shine.
	

	
	Stars they are wherein we read our history,
	As astrologers and seers of eld;
	Yet not wrapped about with awful mystery,
	Like the burning stars that they beheld.
	

	
	Wondrous truths and manifold as wondrous,
	God hath written in those stars above;
	But not less in the bright flowerets under us
	Stands the revelation of His love.
	

	
	Bright and glorious is that revelation,
	Written all over this great world of ours
	Making evident our own creation,
	In these stars of earth, these golden flowers.
	

	
	And the poet, faithful and far-seeing,
	Sees, alike in stars and flowers, a part
	Of the selfsame universal Being,
	Which is throbbing in his brain and heart.
	

	
	      Gorgeous flowerets in the sunlight shining,
	Blossoms flaunting in the eye of day,
	Tremulous leaves, with soft and silver lining;
	Buds that open only to decay;
	

	
	Brilliant hopes, all woven in gorgeous tissues,
	Flaunting gaily in the golden light;
	Large desires with most uncertain issues,
	Tender wishes blossoming at night.
	

	
	These in flowers and men are more than seeming,
	Workings are they of the selfsame powers,
	Which the poet, in no idle dreaming,
	Seeth in himself and in the flowers.
	

	
	Everywhere about us are they glowing,
	Some like stars to tell us Spring is born:
	Others, their blue eyes with tears o       erflowing,
	Stand like Ruth amid the golden corn.
	

	
	Not alone in Spring       s armorial bearing,
	And in summer       s green-emblazoned field,
	But in arms of brave old Autumn       s wearing,
	In the center of his blazoned shield.
	

	
	Not alone in meadows and green alleys
	On the mountaintop and by the brink
	Of sequestered pool in woodland valleys,
	Where the slaves of nature stoop to drink;
	

	
	      Not alone in her vast dome of glory,
	Not on graves of birds or beasts alone,
	But in old cathedrals, high and hoary,
	On the tombs of heroes carved in stone;
	

	
	In the cottage of the rudest peasant,
	In ancestral homes whose crumbling towers,
	Speaking of the Past unto the Present,
	Tell us of the ancient Games of Flowers.
	

	
	In all places, then, and in all seasons,
	Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings;
	Teaching us, by most persuasive reasons,
	How akin they are to human things.
	

	
	And with childlike, credulous affection
	We behold their tender buds expand;
	Emblems of our own great resurrection,
	Emblems of the bright and better land.
	
	       Longfellow
	
	
		      MEADOW-LARKS.
	
	Sweet, sweet, sweet! Oh, happy that I am!
	(Listen to the meadow-larks, across the fields that sing!)
	Sweet, sweet, sweet! O subtle breath of balm,
	O winds that blow, O buds that grow, O rapture of the spring!
	

	
	Sweet, sweet, sweet! O skies, serene and blue,
	That shut the velvet pastures in, that fold the mountain       s crest!
	Sweet, sweet, sweet! What of the clouds ye knew?
	The vessels ride a golden tide, upon a sea at rest.
	

	
	Sweet, sweet, sweet! Who prates of care and pain?
	Who says that life is sorrowful? O life so glad, so fleet!
	Ah! he who lives the noblest life finds life the noblest gain,
	The tears of pain a tender rain to make its waters sweet.
	

	
	      Sweet, sweet, sweet! O happy world that is!
	Dear heart, I hear across the fields my mateling pipe and call
	Sweet, sweet, sweet! O world so full of bliss,
	For life is love, the world is love, and love is over all!
	
	       Ina Coolbrith.
	
	
		THE ARROW AND THE SONG.
	
	I shot an arrow into the air,
	It fell to earth, I knew not where;
	For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
	Could not follow it in its flight.
	

	
	I breathed a song into the air,
	It fell to earth, I knew not where;
	For who has sight so keen and strong,
	That it can follow the flight of song?
	

	
	Long, long afterward, in an oak
	I found the arrow, still unbroke;
	And the song, from beginning to end,
	I found again in the heart of a friend.
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		      THE FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY OF AGASSIZ.17
	
	It was fifty years ago,
	In the pleasant month of May,
	In the beautiful Pays de Vaud,
	A child in its cradle lay.
	

	
	And Nature, the old nurse, took
	The child upon her knee,
	Saying:        Here is a story-book
	Thy Father has written for thee.       
	

	
	       Come, wander with me,        she said,
	       Into regions yet untrod;
	And read what is still unread
	In the manuscripts of God.       
	

	
	And he wandered away and away
	With Nature, the dear old nurse,
	Who sang to him night and day
	The rhymes of the universe.
	

	
	And whenever the way seemed long,
	Or his heart began to fail,
	She would sing a more wonderful song,
	Or tell a more marvelous tale.
	

	
	      So she keeps him still a child,
	And will not let him go,
	Though at times his heart beats wild
	For the beautiful Pays de Vaud;
	

	
	Though at times he hears in his dreams
	The Ranz des Vaches of old,
	And the rush of mountain streams
	From glaciers clear and cold;
	

	
	And the mother at home says,        Hark!
	For his voice I listen and yearn;
	It is growing late and dark,
	And my boy does not return!       
	
	       Longfellow.

		BREAK, BREAK, BREAK.
	
	Break, break, break,
	On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!
	And I would that my tongue could utter
	The thoughts that arise in me.
	

	
	Oh, well for the fisherman       s boy,
	That he shouts with his sister at play!
	Oh, well for the sailor lad,
	That he sings in his boat on the bay!
	

	
	And the stately ships go on
	To their haven under the hill;
	But oh, for the touch of a vanished hand,
	And the sound of a voice that is still!
	

	
	Break, break, break,
	At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!
	But the tender grace of a day that is dead
	Will never come back to me.

		      COLUMBUS       WESTWARD.18
	
	Behind him lay the gray Azores,
	Behind the Gates of Hercules;
	Before him not the ghost of shores,
	Before him only shoreless seas.
	The good mate said:        Now we must pray,
	For lo, the very stars are gone.
	Brave Adm       r       l speak; what shall I say?       
	       Why say:        Sail on! sail on! sail on!              
	

	
	       My men grow mutinous day by day;
	My men grow ghastly wan and weak.       
	The stout mate thought of home; a spray
	Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek.
	       What shall I say, brave Adm       r       l, say,
	If we sight naught but seas at dawn?       
	       Why you shall say at break of day:
	       Sail on! sail on! sail on! sail on!              
	

	
	They sailed and sailed, as the winds might blow,
	Until at last the blanched mate said:
	       Why, not even God would know
	Should I and all my men fall dead.
	      These very winds forget their way,
	For God from these dread seas is gone.
	Now speak, brave Adm       r       l; speak and say              
	He said:        Sail on! sail on! sail on!       
	

	
	They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate:
	       This mad sea shows its teeth to-night.
	He curls his lips, he lies in wait,
	With lifted teeth, as if to bite!
	Brave Adm       r       l, say but one good word;
	What shall we do when hope is gone?       
	The words leapt as a leaping sword:
	       Sail on! sail on! sail on! sail on!       
	

	
	Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,
	And peered through darkness. Ah, that night
	Of all dark nights! And then a speck       
	A light! A light! A light! A light!
	It grew, a starlit flag unfurled!
	It grew to be Time       s burst of dawn.
	He gained a world; he gave that world
	Its grandest lesson:        On! sail on!

		      THE DAY IS DONE.
	
	The day is done, and the darkness
	Falls from the wings of Night,
	As a feather is wafted downward
	From an eagle in his flight.
	

	
	I see the lights of the village
	Gleam through the rain and the mist,
	And a feeling of sadness comes o       er me,
	That my soul cannot resist:
	

	
	A feeling of sadness and longing,
	That is not akin to pain,
	And resembles sorrow only
	As the mist resembles the rain.
	

	
	Come, read to me some poem,
	Some simple and heartfelt lay,
	That shall soothe this restless feeling,
	And banish the thoughts of day.
	

	
	Not from the grand old masters,
	Not from the bards19 sublime,
	Whose distant footsteps echo
	Through the corridors of Time.
	

	
	For, like strains of martial music,
	Their mighty thoughts suggest
	      Life       s endless toil and endeavor;
	And to-night I long for rest.
	

	
	Read from some humbler poet,
	Whose songs gushed from his heart,
	As showers from the clouds of summer,
	Or tears from the eyelids start;
	

	
	Who, through long days of labor;
	And nights devoid of ease,
	Still heard in his soul the music
	Of wonderful melodies.
	

	
	Such songs have power to quiet
	The restless pulse of care,
	And come like the benediction20
	That follows after prayer.
	

	
	Then read from the treasured volume
	The poem of thy choice,
	And lend to the rhyme of the poet
	The beauty of thy voice.
	

	
	And the night shall be filled with music,
	And the cares that infest the day,
	Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,
	And as silently steal away.
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		      THE LANDING OF THE PILGRIMS.
	
	The breaking waves dashed high on a stern and rock-bound coast,
	And the woods against a stormy sky their giant branches tossed;
	And the heavy night hung dark the hills and waters o       er,
	When a band of exiles moored their bark on the wild New England shore.
	

	
	Not as the conqueror comes, they the true-hearted, came;
	Not with the roll of stirring drums, and the trumpet that sings of fame;
	Not as the flying come, in silence and in fear;
	They shook the depths of the desert gloom with their hymns of lofty cheer.
	

	
	Amidst the storm they sang, and the stars heard, and the sea;
	And the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang with the anthems of the free!
	The ocean eagle soared from his nest by the white wave       s foam,
	And the rocking pines of the forest roared       this was their welcome home!
	

	
	      There were men with hoary hair amidst that pilgrim band;
	Why had they come to wither there away from their childhood       s land?
	There was woman       s fearless eye, lit by her deep love       s truth;
	There was manhood       s brow serenely high, and the fiery heart of youth.
	

	
	What sought they thus afar? Bright jewels of the mine?
	The wealth of seas, the spoils of war? They sought a faith       s pure shrine!
	Ay, call it holy ground, the soil where first they trod:
	They left unstained, what there they found, Freedom to worship God.
	
	       Mrs. Hemans.
	
	
		HE PRAYETH BEST.
	
	       He prayeth best, who loveth best
	All things both great and small;
	For the dear God who loveth us,
	He made and loveth all.       
	
	       Coleridge.
	
	
		      EACH AND ALL.
	
	Little thinks, in the field, yon red-cloaked clown,
	Of thee from the hilltop looking down;
	The heifer that lows in the upland farm,
	Far heard, lows not thine ear to charm,
	The sexton, tolling his bell at noon,
	Deems not that great Napoleon
	Stops his horse, and lists with delight,
	Whilst his files sweep round yon Alpine height;
	Nor knowest thou what argument
	Thy life to thy neighbor       s creed has lent.
	All are needed by each one;
	Nothing is fair or good alone.
	I thought the sparrow       s note from heaven,
	Singing at dawn on the alder bough;
	I brought him home, in his nest, at even,
	He sings the song, but it cheers not now,
	For I did not bring the river and sky;
	He sang to my ear, they sang to my eye.
	The delicate shells lay on the shore;
	The bubbles of the latest wave
	Fresh pearls to their enamel gave,
	And the bellowing of the savage sea
	Greeted their safe escape to me.
	      I wiped away the weeds and foam,
	I fetched my sea-born treasures home;
	But the poor, unsightly, noisome things
	Had left their beauty on the shore
	With the sun and the sand and the wild uproar.
	The lover watched his graceful maid,
	As mid the virgin train she strayed,
	Nor knew her beauty       s best attire
	Was woven still by the snow-white quire.
	At last she came to his hermitage,
	Like the bird from the woodlands to the cage;
	The gay enchantment was undone,
	A gentle wife, but fairy none.
	When I said,        I covet truth;
	Beauty is unripe childhood       s cheat;
	I leave it behind with the games of youth.       
	As I spoke, beneath my feet
	The ground pine curled its pretty leaf,
	Running over the club-moss burrs;
	I inhaled the violet       s breath;
	Around me stood the oaks and firs,
	Pine-cones and acorns lay on the ground.
	Over me soared the eternal sky,
	Full of light and of deity;
	Again I saw, again I heard,
	      The rolling river, the morning bird;
	Beauty through my senses stole:
	I yielded myself to the perfect whole.
	
	       Emerson.
	
	
		PAUL REVERE       S RIDE.
	
	Listen, my children, and you shall hear
	Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere.
	On the eighteenth of April in Seventy-five;
	Hardly a man is now alive
	Who remembers that famous day and year.
	

	
	He said to his friend,        If the British march
	By land or sea from the town21 to-night,
	Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
	Of the North Church tower as a signal light       
	One if by land, and two if by sea,
	And I on the opposite shore22 will be,
	Ready to ride and spread the alarm
	Through every Middlesex village and farm,
	For the country folk to be up and to arm.       
	

	
	Then he said        Good-night!        and with muffled oar
	Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
	Just as the moon rose over the bay,
	      Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
	The Somerset, British man-of-war;
	A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
	Across the moon like a prison bar,
	And a huge black hulk that was magnified
	By its own reflection in the tide.
	

	
	Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,
	Wanders and watches with eager ears,
	Till in the silence around him he hears
	The muster of men at the barrack door,
	The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
	And the measured tread of the grenadiers23
	Marching down to their boats on the shore.
	

	
	Then he climbed to the tower of the church,
	Up the wooden stairs with stealthy tread,
	To the belfry chamber overhead,
	And startled the pigeons from their perch,
	On the sombre rafters, that round him made
	Masses and moving shapes of shade       
	Up the light ladder, slender and tall,
	To the highest window in the wall,
	Where he paused to listen and look down
	A moment on the roofs of the town,
	And the moonlight flowing over all.
	

	
	      Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
	Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride
	On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere
	Now he patted his horse       s side,
	Now gazed at the landscape far and near,
	Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,
	And turned and tightened his saddle girth;
	But mostly he watched with eager search
	The belfry-tower of the old North Church,
	As it rose above the graves on the hill,
	Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
	

	
	And lo! as he looks, on the belfry       s height
	A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
	He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
	But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
	A second lamp in the belfry burns!
	

	                        

	
	A hurry of hoofs in the village street,
	A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
	And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
	Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet;
	That was all! And yet through the gloom and the light,
	The fate of a nation was riding that night.
	

	
	      It was twelve by the village clock
	When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
	He heard the crowing of the cock,
	And the barking of the farmer       s dog,
	And felt the damp of the river fog,
	That rises when the sun goes down.
	

	
	It was one by the village clock,
	When he rode into Lexington.
	He saw the gilded weathercock
	Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
	And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
	Gaze at him with a spectral stare,
	As if they already stood aghast
	At the bloody work they would look upon.
	

	
	It was two by the village clock,
	When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
	He heard the bleating of the flock,
	And the twitter of the birds among the trees,
	And felt the breath of the morning breeze
	Blowing over the meadows brown.
	

	                        

	
	So through the night rode Paul Revere;
	And so through the night went his cry of alarm
	To every Middlesex village and farm       
	      A cry of defiance and not of fear,
	A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
	And a word that shall echo forever more!
	For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
	Through all our history, to the last,
	In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
	The people will waken and listen to hear
	The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
	And the midnight message of Paul Revere.
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC.
	
	Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
	He is tramping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
	He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword;
	His truth is marching on.
	

	
	I have seen him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
	They have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
	I have read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps:
	His day is marching on.
	

	
	      I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel;
	       As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;
	Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel;
	Since God is marching on.       
	

	
	He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
	He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat;
	Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer him! be jubilant, my feet!
	Our God is marching on.
	

	
	In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,
	With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me;
	As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,
	While God is marching on.
	
	       Julia Ward Howe.
	
	
		      THE BAREFOOT BOY.24
	
	Blessings on thee, little man,
	Barefoot boy with cheeks of tan!
	With thy turned up pantaloons
	And thy merry whistled tunes;
	With thy red lips, redder still,
	Kissed by strawberries on the hill;
	With the sunshine on thy face,
	Through thy torn brim       s jaunty grace;
	From my heart I give thee joy!       
	I was once a barefoot boy!
	

	
	Oh, for boyhood       s painless play,
	Sleep that wakes in laughing day,
	Health that mocks the doctor       s rules,
	Knowledge never learned in schools,
	Of the wild bee       s morning chase,
	Of the wild flower       s time and place,
	How the tortoise bears his shell,
	How the woodchuck digs his cell,
	

	
	How the robin feeds her young,
	How the oriole       s nest is hung,
	Where the whitest lilies blow,
	Where the freshest berries grow,
	      Where the ground-nut trails its vine,
	Where the wood-grape       s clusters shine,
	Of the black wasp       s cunning way,
	Mason of his walls of clay.
	

	
	Oh, for boyhood       s time of June,
	Crowding years in one brief moon,
	When all things I heard or saw
	Me, their master, waited for!
	I was rich in flowers and trees,
	Humming-birds and honey-bees;
	For my sport the squirrel played,
	Plied the snouted mole his spade.
	

	
	Laughed the brook for my delight,
	Through the day and through the night,
	Whispering at the garden wall,
	Talked with me from fall to fall.
	Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,
	Mine the walnut slopes beyond,
	Mine on bending orchard trees,
	Apples of Hesperides.
	

	
	I was monarch: pomp and joy
	Waited on the barefoot boy!
	
	       Whittier.
	
	
		      LINCOLN, THE GREAT COMMONER.25
	
	When the Norn-mother saw the Whirl-wind Hour,
	Greatening and darkening as it hurried on,
	She bent the strenuous heavens and came down
	To make a man to meet the mortal need.
	She took the tried clay of the common road,
	Clay warm yet with the genial heat of earth,
	Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy:
	Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff,
	It was a stuff to wear for centuries,
	A man that matched the mountains and compelled
	The stars to look our way and honor us.
	

	
	The color of the ground was in him, the red Earth
	The tang and odor of the primal things       
	The rectitude and patience of the rocks:
	The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;
	The courage of the bird that dares the sea;
	The justice of the rain that loves all leaves;
	The pity of the snow that hides all scars;
	The loving kindness of the wayside well;
	The tolerance and equity of light
	That gives as freely to the shrinking weed
	      As to the great oak flaring to the wind       
	To the grave       s low hill as to the Matterhorn
	That shoulders out the sky.
	

	
	And so he came
	From prairie cabin up to Capitol,
	One fair Ideal led our chieftain on.
	Forevermore he burned to do his deed
	With the fine stroke and gesture of a king.
	He built the rail pile as he built the State,
	Pouring his splendid strength through every blow,
	The conscience of him testing every blow,
	To make his deed the measure of a man.
	

	
	So came the captain with the mighty heart;
	And when the step of earthquake shook the house,
	Wrenching the rafters from their ancient hold,
	He held the ridge-pole up and spiked again
	The rafters of the Home. He held his place       
	Held the long purpose like a growing tree       
	Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.
	And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down
	As when a kingly cedar green with boughs
	Goes down with a great shout upon the hills.
	
	       Edwin Markham.
	
	
		      OPPORTUNITY.26
	
	This I beheld, or dreamed it in a dream:
	There spread a cloud of dust along a plain
	And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged
	A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords
	Shocked upon swords and shields, a prince       s banner
	Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes.
	

	
	A craven hung along the battle       s edge,
	And thought:        Had I a sword of keener steel       
	That blue blade that the king       s son bears       but this
	Blunt thing!        He snapped and flung it from his hand,
	And lowering crept away and left the field.
	

	
	Then came the king       s son wounded, sore bestead,
	And weaponless, and saw the broken sword,
	Hilt buried in the dry and trodden sand,
	And ran and snatched it, and with battle shout
	Lifted afresh, he hewed his enemy down,
	And saved a great cause on that heroic day.
	
	       Edward Rowland Sill.
	
	
		      A SONG.27
	
	There is ever a song somewhere, my dear;
	There is ever a something sings alway:
	There       s the song of the lark when the skies are clear,
	And the song of the thrush when the skies are gray.
	

	
	The sunshine showers across the grain,
	And the bluebird trills in the orchard tree;
	And in and out, when the eaves drip rain,
	The swallows are twittering ceaselessly.
	

	
	There is ever a song somewhere, my dear.
	Be the skies above or dark or fair,
	There is ever a song that our hearts may hear       
	There is ever a song somewhere, my dear       
	There is ever a song somewhere!
	

	
	There is ever a song somewhere, my dear,
	In the mid-night black, or the mid-day blue;
	The robin pipes when the sun is here,
	And the cricket chirps the whole night through.
	

	
	      The buds may blow, and the fruit may grow,
	And the autumn leaves drop crisp and sear;
	But whether the sun, or the rain, or the snow,
	There is ever a song somewhere, my dear.
	

	
	There is ever a song somewhere, my dear.
	Be the skies above or dark or fair,
	There is ever a song that our hearts may hear       
	There is ever a song somewhere, my dear       
	There is ever a song somewhere!

		TO A FRIEND.
	
	Green be the turf above thee,
	Friend of my better days!
	None knew thee but to love thee,
	Nor named thee but to praise.
	

	
	Tears fell, when thou wert dying,
	From eyes unused to weep,
	And long, where thou art lying,
	Will tears the cold turf steep.
	

	
	When hearts, whose truth was proven,
	Like thine are laid in earth,
	There should a wreath be woven
	To tell the world their worth.
	
	       Fitz-Greene Halleck.

		PSALM CXXI.
		
		I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills
		from whence cometh my help.
		My help cometh from the Lord, which
		made Heaven and earth.
		He will not suffer thy foot to be moved:
		He that keepeth thee will not slumber.
		Behold, He that keepeth Israel shall
		neither slumber nor sleep.
		The Lord is thy keeper: The Lord is thy
		shade on thy right hand.
		The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor
		the moon by night.
		The Lord shall preserve thee from all
		evil: He shall preserve thy soul.
		The Lord shall preserve thy going out
		and thy coming in from this time forth,
		and even for evermore.

		      RAIN IN SUMMER.
	
	How beautiful is the rain!
	After the dust and heat,
	In the broad and fiery street,
	In the narrow lane,
	How beautiful is the rain!
	

	
	How it clatters upon the roofs
	Like the tramp of hoofs!
	How it gushes and struggles out
	From the throat of the overflowing spout.
	

	
	Across the window-pane
	It pours and pours,
	And swift and wide,
	With a muddy tide,
	Like a river down the gutter roars
	The rain, the welcome rain!
	

	
	The sick man from his chamber looks
	At the twisted brooks;
	He can feel the cool
	Breath of each little pool;
	His fevered brain
	Grows calm again,
	And he breathes a blessing on the rain!
	

	
	From the neighboring school
	Come the boys
	      With more than their wonted noise
	And commotion;
	And down the wet streets
	Sail their mimic28 fleets,
	Till the treacherous pool
	Engulfs them in its whirling
	And turbulent ocean.
	

	
	In the country on every side,
	Where, far and wide,
	Like a leopard       s tawny and spotted hide,
	Stretches the plain,
	To the dry grass and the drier grain
	How welcome is the rain!
	

	
	In the furrowed land
	The toilsome and patient oxen stand,
	Lifting the yoke-encumbered29 head,
	With their dilated nostrils spread,
	They silently inhale
	The clover-scented gale,
	And the vapors that arise
	From the well-watered and smoking soil
	For this rest in the furrow after toil,
	Their large and lustrous eyes
	Seem to thank the Lord,
	More than man       s spoken word.
	

	
	      Near at hand,
	From under the sheltering trees,
	The farmer sees
	His pastures and his fields of grain,
	As they bend their tops
	To the numberless beating drops
	Of the incessant rain.
	He counts it as no sin
	That he sees therein
	Only his own thrift and gain.
	

	
	These and far more than these,
	The Poet sees!
	He can behold
	Aquarius30 old
	Walking the fenceless fields of air
	And, from each ample fold
	Of the clouds about him rolled,
	Scattering everywhere
	The showery rain,
	As the farmer scatters his grain.
	

	
	He can behold
	Things manifold
	That have not yet been wholly told,
	Have not been wholly sung nor said.
	For his thought, which never stops,
	      Follows the water-drops
	Down to the graves of the dead,
	Down through chasms and gulfs profound
	To the dreary fountain-head
	Of lakes and rivers under ground,
	And sees them, when the rain is done,
	On the bridge of colors seven,
	Climbing up once more to heaven,
	Opposite the setting sun.
	

	
	Thus the seer,31
	With vision clear,
	Sees forms appear and disappear,
	In the perpetual round of strange
	Mysterious change
	From birth to death, from death to birth;
	From earth to heaven, from heaven to earth,
	Till glimpses more sublime
	Of things unseen before
	Unto his wondering eyes reveal
	The universe, as an immeasurable wheel
	Turning forevermore
	In the rapid and rushing river of time.
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		      A PSALM OF LIFE.
	
	Tell me not in mournful numbers,
	Life is but an empty dream!
	For the soul is dead that slumbers,
	And things are not what they seem.
	

	
	Life is real! life is earnest!
	And the grave is not its goal;
	Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
	Was not spoken of the soul.
	

	
	Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
	Is our destined end or way;
	But to act, that each to-morrow
	Find us farther than to-day.
	

	
	Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
	And our hearts though stout and brave,
	Still, like muffled drums, are beating
	Funeral marches to the grave.
	

	
	In the world       s broad field of battle,
	In the bivouac of life,
	Be not like dumb, driven cattle       
	Be a hero in the strife!
	

	
	Trust no future, howe       er pleasant;
	Let the dead past bury its dead!
	      Act, act in the living present,
	Heart within, and God o       erhead!
	

	
	Lives of great men all remind us
	We can make our lives sublime,
	And, departing, leave behind us
	Footprints on the sands of time:
	

	
	Footprints that perhaps another,
	Sailing o       er life       s solemn main,
	A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
	Seeing, shall take heart again.
	

	
	Let us, then, be up and doing,
	With a heart for any fate;
	Still achieving, still pursuing,
	Learn to labor and to wait.
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		HYMN ON THE FIGHT AT CONCORD.
	
	By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
	Their flag to April       s breeze unfurled,
	Here once the embattled farmers stood,
	And fired the shot heard round the world.
	

	
	The foe long since in silence slept,
	Alike the conqueror silent sleeps,
	And Time the ruined bridge has swept
	Down the dark stream which seaward creeps.
	

	
	      On this green bank, by this soft stream,
	We set to-day the votive stone,
	That memory may their deed redeem,
	When, like our sires, our sons are gone.
	

	
	Spirit that made those heroes dare
	To die, and leave their children free,
	Bid Time and Nature gently spare
	The shaft we raise to them and thee.
	
	       R. W. Emerson.
	
	
		TO A WATERFOWL.
	
	Whither,        midst falling dew,
	While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
	Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
	Thy solitary way?
	

	
	Vainly the fowlers        eye
	Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,
	As, darkly seen against the crimson sky,
	Thy figure floats along.
	

	
	Seek       st thou the plashy brink
	Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
	Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
	On the chafed ocean side?
	

	
	      There is a Power whose care
	Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,
	The desert and illimitable air,
	Lone wandering, but not lost.
	

	
	All day thy wings have fanned,
	At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere,
	Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,
	Though the dark night is near.
	

	
	And soon that toil shall end;
	Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,
	And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend
	Soon o       er thy sheltered nest.
	

	
	Thou       rt gone, the abyss of heaven
	Hath swallow       d up thy form; yet, on my heart,
	Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,
	And shall not soon depart.
	

	
	He who, from zone to zone,
	Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
	In the long way that I must tread alone,
	Will lead my steps aright.
	
	       Bryant.
	
	
		      THE HERITAGE.
	
	The rich man       s son inherits lands,
	And piles of brick and stone, and gold,
	And he inherits soft white hands,
	And tender flesh that fears the cold,
	Nor dares to wear a garment old;
	A heritage it seems to me,
	One scarce would wish to hold in fee.
	

	
	The rich man       s son inherits cares;
	The banks may break, the factory burn,
	A breath may burst his bubble shares,
	And soft white hands could hardly earn
	A living that would serve his turn;
	A heritage it seems to me,
	One scarce would wish to hold in fee.
	

	
	The rich man       s son inherits wants,
	His stomach craves for dainty fare;
	With sated heart, he hears the pants
	Of toiling hands with brown arms bare,
	And wearies in his easy-chair;
	A heritage it seems to me,
	One scarce would wish to hold in fee.
	

	
	What doth the poor man       s son inherit?
	Stout muscles and a sinewy heart,
	A hardy frame, a hardier spirit;
	      King of two hands, he does his part
	In every useful toil and art;
	A heritage it seems to me,
	A king might wish to hold in fee.
	

	
	What doth the poor man       s son inherit?
	Wishes o       erjoyed with humble things,
	A rank adjudged by toil-won merit,
	Content that from enjoyment springs,
	A heart that in his labor sings;
	A heritage it seems to me,
	A king might wish to hold in fee.
	

	
	What doth the poor man       s son inherit?
	A patience learned of being poor,
	Courage, if sorrow come, to bear it,
	A fellow-feeling that is sure
	To make the outcast bless his door;
	A heritage, it seems to me
	A king might wish to hold in fee.
	

	
	O rich man       s son! there is a toil
	That with all others level stands;
	Large charity doth never soil,
	But only whiten, soft, white hands       
	This is the best crop from thy lands;
	A heritage, it seems to me,
	Worth being rich to hold in fee.
	

	
	      O poor man       s son, scorn not thy state;
	There is worse weariness than thine,
	In merely being rich and great;
	Toil only gives the soul to shine,
	And makes rest fragrant and benign;
	A heritage, it seems to me,
	Worth being poor to hold in fee.
	

	
	Both, heirs to some six feet of sod,
	Are equal in the earth at last;
	Both children of the same dear God,
	Prove title to your heirship vast
	By record of a well-filled past;
	A heritage, it seems to me,
	Well worth a life to hold in fee.
	
	       Lowell.
	
	
		ELEGYWRITTEN IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD.
	
	The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
	The lowing herd winds slowly o       er the lea,
	The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
	And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
	

	
	Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
	And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
	      Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
	And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:
	

	
	Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow       r
	The moping owl does to the moon complain
	Of such as, wand       ring near her secret bow       r,
	Molest her ancient solitary reign.
	

	
	Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree       s shade,
	Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
	Each in his narrow cell forever laid,
	The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.
	

	
	The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,
	The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
	The cock       s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
	No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
	

	
	For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
	Or busy housewife ply her evening care:
	No children run to lisp their sire       s return,
	Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.
	

	
	Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
	Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke:
	      How jocund did they drive their team afield!
	How bow       d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!
	

	
	Let not ambition mock their useful toil,
	Their homely joys and destiny obscure;
	Nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,
	The short and simple annals of the poor.
	

	
	The boast of heraldry; the pomp of pow       r,
	And all that beauty, all that wealth e       er gave,
	Await alike the inevitable hour       
	The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
	

	
	Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,
	If mem       ry o       er their tomb no trophies raise,
	Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,
	The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.
	

	
	Can storied urn or animated bust
	Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
	Can honor       s voice provoke the silent dust,
	Or flatt       ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?
	

	
	Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
	Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
	      Hands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,
	Or waked to ecstacy the living lyre.
	

	
	But knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
	Rich with the spoils of time, did ne       er unroll;
	Chill penury repress       d their noble rage,
	And froze the genial current of the soul.
	

	
	Full many a gem of purest ray serene
	The dark unfathom       d caves of ocean bear:
	Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
	And waste its sweetness on the desert air,
	

	
	Some village Hampden, that with dauntless breast
	The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
	Some mute, inglorious Milton here may rest,
	Some Cromwell guiltless of his country       s blood.
	

	
	Th        applause of list       ning senates to command,
	The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
	To scatter plenty o       er a smiling land,
	And read their hist       ry in a nation       s eyes
	

	
	Their lot forbade: nor circumscrib       d alone
	Their growing virtues, but their crimes confin       d:
	      Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,
	And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,
	

	
	The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
	To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,
	Or heap the shrine of luxury and pride
	With incense kindled at the Muse       s flame.
	

	
	Far from the madding crowd       s ignoble strife,
	Their sober wishes never learned to stray;
	Along the cool, sequester       d vale of life
	They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.
	

	
	Yet e       en these bones from insult to protect
	Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
	With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck       d,
	Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.
	

	
	Their name, their years, spelt by th        unletter       d Muse,
	The place of fame and elegy supply:
	And many a holy text around she strews,
	That teach the rustic moralist to die.
	

	
	For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,
	This pleasing anxious being e       er resign       d,
	Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
	Nor cast one longing, ling       ring look behind?
	

	
	      On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
	Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
	Ev       n from the tomb the voice of nature cries,
	Ev       n in our ashes live their wonted fires.
	

	
	For thee, who, mindful of th        unhonor       d Dead,
	Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
	If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
	Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate,
	

	
	Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
	       Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
	Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,
	To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.
	

	
	       There at the foot of yonder nodding beech,
	That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,
	His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
	And pore upon the brook that babbles by
	

	
	       Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
	Mutt       ring his wayward fancies he would rove;
	Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,
	Or craz       d with care, or cross       d in hopeless love.
	

	
	       One morn I missed him on the custom       d hill,
	Along the heath, and near his fav       rite tree;
	      Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
	Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he.
	

	
	       The next, with dirges due in sad array,
	Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne       
	Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay,
	Grav       d on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.       
	

	THE EPITAPH.
	
	Here rests his head upon the lap of earth

	Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
	Heav       n did a recompense as largely send:

		      GRADATIM.32
	
	Heaven is not gained at a single bound;
	But we build the ladder by which we rise
	From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies,
	And we mount to its summit round by round.
	

	
	I count this thing to be grandly true,
	That a noble deed is a step toward God       
	Lifting the soul from the common sod
	To a purer air and a broader view.
	

	
	We rise by things that are        neath our feet;
	By what we have mastered of good and gain;
	By the pride deposed and the passion slain,
	And the vanquished ills that we hourly meet.
	

	
	We hope, we aspire, we resolve, we trust,
	When the morning calls us to life and light,
	But our hearts grow weary, and, ere the night,
	Our lives are trailing the sordid dust.
	

	
	We hope, we resolve, we aspire, we pray,
	And we think that we mount the air on wings
	Beyond the recall of sensual things,
	While our feet still cling to the heavy clay.
	

	
	      Wings for the angels, but feet for men!
	We may borrow the wings to find the way       
	We may hope, and resolve, and aspire, and pray,
	But our feet must rise, or we fall again.
	

	
	Only in dreams is a ladder thrown
	From the weary earth to the sapphire walls;
	But the dream departs, and the vision falls,
	And the sleeper wakes on his pillow of stone.
	

	
	Heaven is not reached at a single bound:
	But we build the ladder by which we rise
	From the lowly earth to the vaulted skies,
	And we mount to its summit round by round.
	
	       J. G. Holland.
	
	
		      GOD SAVE THE FLAG.33
	
	Washed in the blood of the brave and the blooming,
	Snatched from the altars of insolent foes,
	Burning with star-fires, but never consuming,
	Flashed its broad ribbons of lily and rose.
	

	
	Vainly the prophets of Baal would rend it,
	Vainly his worshipers pray for its fall;
	Thousands have died for it, millions defend it,
	Emblem of justice and mercy to all.
	

	
	Justice that reddens the sky with her terrors,
	Mercy that comes with her white-handed train,
	Soothing all passions, redeeming all errors,
	Sheathing the saber and breaking the chain.
	

	
	Born on the deluge of old usurpations,
	Drifted our Ark o       er the desolate seas,
	Bearing the rainbow of hope to the nations
	Torn from the storm-cloud and flung to the breeze!
	

	
	God bless the flag and its loyal defenders
	While its broad folds o       er the battle-fields wave,

		LIFE.34
	
	Forenoon and afternoon and night       Forenoon and afternoon and night,
	Forenoon, and       what!
	The empty song repeats itself. No more?

	      EIGHTH GRADE
	
		HYMN TO THE NIGHT.
	
	I heard the trailing garments of the Night
	Sweep through her marble halls!
	I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light
	From the celestial walls!
	

	
	I felt her presence, by its spell of might,
	Stoop o       er me from above;
	The calm, majestic presence of the Night,
	As of the one I love.
	

	
	I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight,
	The manifold soft chimes,
	That fill the haunted chambers of the Night,
	Like some old poet       s rhymes.
	

	
	From the cool cisterns of the midnight air
	My spirit drank repose;
	The fountain of perpetual peace flows there       
	From those deep cisterns flows.
	

	
	O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear
	What man has borne before!
	      Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Care,
	And they complain no more.
	

	
	Peace! Peace! Orestes-like I breathe this prayer!
	Descend with broad-winged flight,
	The welcome, the thrice-prayed for, the most fair,
	The best beloved Night!
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		THE BUILDERS.
	
	All are architects of Fate,
	Working in these walls of Time;
	Some with massive deeds and great,
	Some with ornaments of rhyme.
	

	
	Nothing useless is, or low;
	Each thing in its place is best;
	And what seems but idle show
	Strengthens and supports the rest.
	

	
	For the structure that we raise,
	Time is with materials filled;
	Our to-days and yesterdays
	Are the blocks with which we build.
	

	
	Truly shape and fasten these;
	Leave no yawning gaps between;
	      Think not, because no man sees,
	Such things will remain unseen.
	

	
	In the elder days of art,
	Builders wrought with greatest care
	Each minute and unseen part;
	For the gods see everywhere.
	

	
	Let us do our work as well
	Both the unseen and the seen;
	Make the house where God may dwell
	Beautiful, entire, and clean.
	

	
	Else our lives are incomplete,
	Standing in these walls of Time,
	Broken stairways, where the feet
	Stumble as they seek to climb.
	

	
	Build to-day, then, strong and sure,
	With a firm and ample base;
	And ascending and secure
	Shall to-morrow find its place.
	

	
	Thus alone can we attain
	To those turrets, where the eye
	Sees the world as one vast plain,
	And one boundless reach of sky.
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		      POLONIUS        ADVICE TO LAERTES.
	
	Give thy thoughts no tongue,
	Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
	The friends thou hast and their adoption tried,
	Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel;
	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
	Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade.
	Beware
	Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
	Bear it that the opposer may beware of thee.
	Give every man thine ear; but few thine voice;
	Take each man       s censure; but reserve thy judgment.
	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
	But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
	For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
	And they in France, of the best rank and station,
	Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
	Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
	For a loan oft loses both itself and friend.
	      And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
	This above all       to thine own self be true,
	And it must follow, as the night the day,
	Thou can       st not then be false to any man.
	
	       Shakespeare.
	
	
		THANATOPSIS.
	
	To him who in the love of nature holds
	Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
	A various language; for his gayer hours
	She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
	And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
	Into his darker musings, with a mild
	And healing sympathy, that steals away
	Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts
	Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
	Over thy spirit, and sad images
	Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
	And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
	Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart       
	Go forth, under the open sky, and list
	To Nature       s teachings, while from all around       
	Earth and her waters, and the depths of air       
	      Comes a still voice       Yet a few days, and thee
	The all-beholding sun shall see no more
	In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,
	Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
	Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
	Thy image.  Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
	Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,
	And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
	Thine individual being shalt thou go
	To mix forever with the elements.
	To be a brother to the insensible rock
	And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
	Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
	Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.
	Yet not to thine eternal resting-place
	Shalt thou retire alone       nor couldst thou wish
	Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
	With patriarchs of the infant world       with kings,
	The powerful of the earth       the wise, the good,
	Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
	All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills
	      Book-ribbed and ancient as the sun       the vales
	Stretching in pensive quietness between;
	The venerable woods       rivers that move
	In majesty, and the complaining brooks
	That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,
	Old ocean       s gray and melancholy waste       
	Are but the solemn decorations all
	Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
	The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
	Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
	Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
	The globe are but a handful to the tribes
	That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
	Of morning       and the Barcan desert pierce,
	Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
	Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
	Save his own dashings       yet       the dead are there;
	And millions in those solitudes, since first
	The flight of years began, have laid them down
	In their last sleep       the dead reign there alone.
	So shalt thou rest       and what if thou withdraw
	Unheeded by the living       and no friend
	Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
	Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
	      When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
	Plod on, and each one as before will chase
	His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
	Their mirth and their employment, and shall come
	And make their bed with thee. As the long train
	Of ages glide away, the sons of men,
	The youth in life       s green spring, and he who goes
	In the full strength of years, matron, and maid,
	And the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man,
	Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,
	By those, who in their turn shall follow them.
	So live, that when thy summons comes to join
	The innumerable caravan, that moves
	To that mysterious realm, where each shall take
	His chamber in the silent halls of death,
	Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
	Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed
	By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
	Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
	About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
	
	       Bryant.
	
	
		      THE AMERICAN FLAG.
	
	When Freedom, from her mountain height,
	Unfurled her standard to the air,
	She tore the azure robe of night,
	And set the stars of glory there.
	She mingled with its gorgeous dyes
	The milky baldric of the skies,
	And striped its pure, celestial white
	With streakings of the morning light;
	Then, from his mansion in the sun,
	She called her eagle bearer down,
	And gave into his mighty hand
	The symbol of her chosen land.
	

	
	Majestic monarch of the cloud!
	Who rear       st aloft thy regal form,
	To hear the tempest trumpings loud
	And see the lightning lances driven,
	When strive the warriors of the storm,
	And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven       
	Child of the sun! to thee        tis given
	To guard the banner of the free;
	To hover in the sulphur smoke,
	To ward away the battle-stroke;
	And bid its blending shine afar,
	Like rainbows on the clouds of war,
	The harbingers of victory!
	

	
	      Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,
	The sign of hope and triumph high!
	When speaks the signal trumpet tone,
	And the long line comes gleaming on,
	Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet,
	Has dimmed the glistening bayonet,
	Each soldier eye shall brightly turn
	To where thy sky-born glories burn,
	And, as his springing steps advance,
	Catch war and vengeance from the glance;
	And when the cannon-mouthings loud
	Heave in wild wreaths the battle-shroud,
	And gory sabres rise and fall,
	Like shoots of flame on midnight       s pall,
	Then shall thy meteor glances glow,
	And cowering foes shall shrink beneath
	Each gallant arm that strikes below
	That lovely messenger of death.
	

	
	Flag of the seas! on ocean wave
	Thy stars shall glitter o       er the brave,
	When death, careering on the gale,
	Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,
	And frightened waves rush wildly back
	Before the broadside       s reeling rack;
	Each dying wanderer of the sea
	Shall look at once to heaven and thee,
	      And smile to see thy splendors fly
	In triumph o       er his closing eye.
	

	
	Flag of the free heart       s hope and home,
	By angel hands to valor given,
	Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
	And all thy hues were born in heaven.
	Forever float that standard sheet!
	Where breathes the foe but falls before us,
	With Freedom       s soil beneath our feet,
	And Freedom       s banner streaming o       er us!

		SPEECH AT THE DEDICATION OF
		THE NATIONAL CEMETERY AT
		GETTYSBURG.

		November 18, 1863.

		Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers
		brought forth upon this continent a new
		nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated
		to the proposition that all men are created
		equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil
		war, testing whether that nation, or any
		nation so conceived and so dedicated, can
		long endure. We are met on a great battlefield
		of that war. We have come to dedicate
		      a portion of that field as a final resting place
		for those who here gave their lives that that
		nation might live. It is altogether fitting
		and proper that we should do this. But in a
		larger sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot
		consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground.
		The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
		here, have consecrated it far above our
		power to add or detract. The world will
		little note, nor long remember what we say
		here; but it can never forget what they did
		here. It is for us, the living, rather to be
		dedicated here to the unfinished work which
		they who fought here have thus far so nobly
		advanced. It is rather for us, to be here
		dedicated to the great task remaining before
		us, that from these honored dead we take
		increased devotion to that cause for which
		they gave the last full measure of devotion;
		that we here highly resolve that these dead
		shall not have died in vain; that this nation,
		under God, shall have a new birth of freedom,
		and that government of the people, by
		the people, and for the people, shall not
		perish from the earth.

		       President Lincoln.
	
	
		      TO A SKYLARK.
	
	Hail to thee, blithe spirit       
	Bird thou never wert       
	That from heaven, or near it
	Pourest thy full heart
	In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
	

	
	Higher still and higher
	From the earth thou springest,
	Like a cloud of fire:
	The blue deep thou wingest,
	And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
	

	
	In the golden lightning
	Of the setting sun,
	O       er which clouds are bright       ning,
	Thou dost float and run;
	Like an embodied joy whose race is just begun.
	

	
	The pale purple even
	Melts around thy flight;
	Like a star of heaven,
	In the broad daylight,
	Thou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight.
	

	
	      Keen as are the arrows
	Of that silvery sphere,
	Whose intense lamp narrows
	In the white dawn clear,
	Until we hardly see, we feel, that it is there.
	

	
	All the earth and air
	With thy voice is loud,
	As, when night is bare,
	From one lonely cloud
	The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflow       d.
	

	
	What thou art we know not;
	What is most like thee!
	From rainbow clouds there flow not
	Drops so bright to see,
	As from thy presence showers a rain of melody.
	

	
	Like a poet hidden
	In the light of thought,
	Singing hymns unbidden,
	Till the world is wrought
	To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not;
	

	
	Like a high-born maiden
	In a palace tower,
	      Soothing her love-laden
	Soul in secret hour
	With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower;
	

	
	Like a glow-worm golden,
	In a dell of dew,
	Scattering unbeholden
	Its aerial hue
	Among the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view;
	

	
	Like a rose embowered
	In its own green leaves,
	By warm winds deflower       d,
	Till the scent it gives
	Makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves.
	

	
	Sound of vernal showers
	On the twinkling grass,
	Rain-awakened flowers,
	All that ever was
	Joyous, and fresh and clear, thy music doth surpass.
	

	
	Teach us, sprite or bird,
	What sweet thoughts are thine;
	I have never heard
	      Praise of lore or wine
	That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
	

	
	Chorus hymeneal,
	Or triumphant chant,
	Match       d with thine, would be all
	But an empty vaunt       
	A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
	

	
	What object are the fountains
	Of thy happy strain?
	What fields, or waves, or mountains?
	What shapes of sky or plain?
	What love of thine own kind? What ignorance of pain?
	

	
	With thy clear, keen joyance
	Languor cannot be;
	Shadow of annoyance
	Never came near thee;
	Thou lovest, but ne       er knew love       s sad satiety.
	

	
	Waking, or asleep,
	Thou of death must deem
	Things more true and deep
	Than we mortals dream,
	Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
	

	
	      We look before and after,
	And pine for what is not;
	Our sincerest laughter
	With some pain is fraught;
	Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
	

	
	Yet if we could scorn
	Hate, and pride and fear,
	If we were things born
	Not to shed a tear,
	I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
	

	
	Better than all measures
	Of delightful sound,
	Better than all treasures
	That in books are found,
	Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
	

	
	Teach me half the gladness
	That thy brain must know,
	Such harmonious madness
	From my lips would flow,
	The world should listen then, as I am listening now.
	
	       Percy Bysshe Shelley.
	
	
		      THE LAUNCHING OF THE SHIP.
	
	Then the Master,
	With a gesture of command,
	Waved his hand;
	And at the word,
	Loud and sudden there was heard,
	All around them and below,
	The sound of hammers, blow on blow,
	Knocking away the shores and spurs.
	And see! she stirs!
	She starts       she moves       she seems to feel
	The thrill of life along her keel,
	And, spurning with her foot the ground,
	With one exulting, joyous bound,
	She leaps into the ocean       s arms!
	

	
	And lo! from the assembled crowd
	There rose a shout, prolonged and loud,
	That to the ocean seemed to say,
	       Take her, O bridegroom, old and gray.
	Take her to thy protecting arms,
	With all her youth and all her charms!       
	

	
	How beautiful she is! How fair
	She lies within those arms, that press
	Her form with many a soft caress
	Of tenderness and watchful care!
	      Sail forth into the sea, O ship!
	Through wind and wave, right onward steer!
	The moistened eye, the trembling lip,
	Are not the signs of doubt or fear.
	

	
	Sail forth into the sea of life,
	O gentle, loving, trusting wife,
	And safe from all adversity
	Upon the bosom of that sea
	Thy comings and thy goings be!
	For gentleness and love and trust
	Prevail o       er angry wave and gust;
	And in the wreck of noble lives
	Something immortal still survives!
	

	
	Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!
	Sail on, O Union, strong and great!
	Humanity with all its fears,
	With all the hopes of future years,
	Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
	

	
	We know what Master laid thy keel,
	What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,
	Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,
	What anvils rang, what hammers beat,
	In what a forge and what a heat
	Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!
	

	
	      Fear not each sudden sound and shock,
	       Tis of the wave and not the rock;
	       Tis but the flapping of the sail,
	And not a rent made by the gale!
	In spite of rock and tempest       s roar,
	In spite of false lights on the shore,
	Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!
	

	
	Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,
	Our hearts our hopes, our prayers, our tears,
	Our faith triumphant o       er our fears,
	Are all with thee,       are all with thee!
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
		RECESSIONAL.
	
	God of our fathers, known of old       
	Lord of our far-flung battle line       
	Beneath Whose awful Hand we hold
	Dominion over palm and pine       
	Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
	Lest we forget       lest we forget!
	

	
	The tumult and the shouting dies       
	The captains and the kings depart,
	Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,
	      An humble and a contrite heart.
	Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
	Lest we forget       lest we forget!
	

	
	Far-called our navies melt away       
	On dune and headland sinks the fire       
	Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
	Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
	Judge of the nations, spare us yet,
	Lest we forget       lest we forget!
	

	
	If, drunk with sight of power, we loose
	Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe       
	Such boasting as the Gentiles use,
	Or lesser breeds without the Law       
	Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
	Lest we forget       lest we forget!
	

	
	For heathen heart that puts her trust
	In reeking tube and iron shard       
	All valiant dust that builds on dust,
	And guarding calls not Thee to guard       
	For frantic boast and foolish word,
	Thy mercy on Thy people, Lord!
	Amen.
	
	       Kipling.
	
	
		      THE LADDER OF ST. AUGUSTINE.
	
	Saint Augustine! well hast thou said,
	That of our vices we can frame
	A ladder, if we will but tread
	Beneath our feet each deed of shame.
	

	
	All common things, each day       s events,
	That with the hour begin and end,
	Our pleasures and our discontents,
	Are rounds by which we may ascend.
	

	
	The low desire, the base design,
	That makes another       s virtues less;
	The revel of the ruddy wine,
	And all occasions of excess;
	

	
	The longing for ignoble things;
	The strife for triumph more than truth;
	The hardening of the heart, that brings
	Irreverence for the dreams of youth;
	

	
	All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds,
	That have their root in thoughts of ill;
	Whatever hinders or impedes
	The action of the nobler will.
	

	
	All these must first be trampled down
	Beneath our feet, if we would gain
	      In the bright fields of fair renown
	The right of eminent domain.
	

	
	We have not wings, we cannot soar;
	But we have feet to scale and climb
	By slow degrees, by more and more,
	The cloudy summits of our time.
	

	
	The mighty pyramids of stone
	That wedge-like cleave the desert airs,
	When nearer seen, and better known,
	Are but gigantic flights of stairs.
	

	
	The distant mountains, that uprear
	Their solid bastions to the skies,
	Are crossed by pathways, that appear
	As we to higher levels rise.
	

	
	The heights by great men reached and kept
	Were not attained by sudden flight,
	But they, while their companions slept,
	Were toiling upward in the night.
	

	
	Standing on what too long we bore
	With shoulders bent and downcast eyes,
	We may discern       unseen before       
	A path to higher destinies.
	

	
	      Nor deem the irrevocable Past
	As wholly wasted, wholly vain,
	If, rising on its wrecks, at last
	To something nobler we attain.
	
	       Longfellow.
	
	
	THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS.35
	
	This is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,
	Sails the unshadowed main,       
	The venturous bark that flings
	On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
	In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,
	And coral reefs lie bare,
	Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.
	

	
	Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
	Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
	And every chambered cell,
	Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,
	As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
	Before thee lies revealed,       
	Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!
	

	
	      Year after year beheld the silent toil
	That spread his lustrous coil;
	Still, as the spiral grew,
	He left the past year       s dwelling for the new,
	Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
	Built up its idle door,
	Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.
	

	
	Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,
	Child of the wandering sea.
	Cast from her lap, forlorn!
	From thy dead lips a clearer note is born
	Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn!
	While on mine ear it rings,
	Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:       
	

	
	Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
	As the swift seasons roll!
	Leave thy low-vaulted past!
	Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
	Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
	Till thou at length art free,
	Leaving thine outgrown shell by life       s unresting sea!
	
	       Oliver Wendell Holmes.
	
	
		      PRESIDENT WILLIAM McKINLEY
		To the Young People of Oakland, Cal.
		May 24, 1901

		       There is nothing better for the United
		States than Educated Citizenship; and,
		my young friends, there never was a time in
		all our history when knowledge was so essential
		to success as now. Everything requires
		knowledge. What we want of the young
		people now is exact knowledge. You want
		to know whatever you undertake to do a
		little better than anybody else. And if you
		will do that, then there is nothing that is not
		within your reach.

		And what you want besides education is
		Character       Character! There is nothing
		that will serve a young man or an old man so
		well as good character. And did you ever
		think that it is just as easy to form a good
		habit as it is to form a bad one; and it is
		just as hard to break a good habit as it is to
		break a bad one? So get the good ones and
		keep them. With Education and Character
		you will not only achieve individual
		success, but you will contribute largely to
		the progress of your country.       
	


	      BRIEF MEMORY GEMS AND PROVERBS.
	
		FIRST AND SECOND GRADES.

		
		If at first you don       t succeed,
		Try, try again.
		      
		

		
		Be kind and be gentle
		To those who are old,
		For dearer is kindness
		And better than gold.
		      
		

		
		Sing, pretty birds, and build your nests,
		The fields are green, the skies are clear;
		Sing, pretty birds, and build your nests,
		The world is glad to have you here.
		      
		

		
		A friend in need is a friend indeed.
		      
		

		
		If a task is once begun,
		Never leave it till it       s done;
		Be the labor great or small,
		Do it well or not at all.
		      
		

		
		      Whatever way the wind doth blow,
		Some heart is glad to have it so,
		So blow it east, or blow it west,
		The wind that blows       that wind is best.
		      
		

		
		Dare to do right! dare to be true!
		For you have a work no other can do;
		Do it so bravely, so kindly, so well,
		Angels will hasten the story to tell.
		      
		

		
		To do to others as I would
		That they should do to me
		Will make me honest, kind and good,
		As children ought to be.
		      
		

		
		God make my life a little light,
		Within the world to glow:
		A little flame that burneth bright
		Wherever I may go.
		      
		

		
		Better be an hour too early than a minute
		too late.
		      
		

		
		       Help one another,        the snowflakes said,
		As they cuddled down in their fleecy bed,
		       One of us here would not be felt,
		One of us here would quickly melt;
		But I       ll help you and you help me,
		And then what a splendid drift there       ll be.       
		      
		

		
		      By-and-by is a very bad boy,
		Shun him at once and forever;
		For they who travel with By-and-by
		Soon come to the house of Never.
		      
		

		
		Politeness is to do and say
		The kindest things in the kindest way.
		      
		

		
		And isn't it, my boy or girl,
		The wisest, bravest plan,
		Whatever comes, or doesn't come,
		To do the best you can?
		      
		
	
	
		      THIRD AND FOURTH GRADES.

		
		Beautiful hands are those that do
		Work that is earnest, brave and true
		Moment by moment, the long day through.
		      
		

		
		Kind hearts are gardens,
		Kind thoughts are roots,
		Kind words are blossoms,
		Kind deeds are fruits;
		Love is the sweet sunshine
		That warms into life,
		For only in darkness
		Grow hatred and strife.
		      
		

		
		Be good, dear child, and let who will be clever;
		Do noble deeds, not dream them all day long;
		And so make life, death, and that vast forever
		One grand, sweet song.
		       Kingsley.
		

		
		Whene       er a task is set for you
		Don       t idly sit and view it,       
		Nor be content to wish it done;
		Begin at once and do it.
		      
		

		
		      Look up and not down, look forward and
		not back, look out and not in, and lend a
		hand.
		       Hale.
		

		
		This world is not so bad a world
		As some would like to make it;
		Though whether good or whether bad,
		Depends on how we take it.
		       M. W. Beck.
		

		
		Let us, then, be up and doing,
		With a heart for any fate;
		Still achieving, still pursuing,
		Learn to labor and to wait.
		       Longfellow.
		

		
		Dare to be true, nothing can need a lie;
		A fault which needs it most grows two thereby.
		       George Herbert.
		

		
		If wisdom       s ways you       d wisely seek,
		Five things observe with care,       
		Of whom you speak, to whom you speak,
		And how, and when, and where.
		      
		

		
		Cowards are cruel, but the brave
		Love mercy, and delight to save.
		       Gay.
		

		
		      If there is a virtue in the world at which
		we should always aim, it is cheerfulness.
		       Bulwer Lytton.
		

		
		       Tis distance lends enchantment to the view
		And clothes the mountain with its azure hue.
		       Campbell.
		

		
		Give fools their gold and knaves their power,
		Let fortune       s bubble rise and fall;
		Who sows a field, or trains a flower,
		Or plants a tree is more than all.
		       Whittier.
		

		
		Our to-days and yesterdays
		Are the blocks with which we build.
		       Longfellow.
		

		
		Too low they build who build beneath the
		stars.
		       Young.
		

		
		Errors, like straws upon the surface flow;
		He who would seek for pearls must dive below.
		       Dryden.
		

		
		The cross, if rightly borne, shall be
		No burden, but support to thee.
		       Whittier.
		

		
		      Oh, deem it not an idle thing
		A pleasant word to speak;
		The face you wear, the thoughts you bring,
		A heart may heal or break.
		      
		

		
		Lives of great men all remind us
		We can make our lives sublime,       
		And, departing, leave behind us
		Footprints on the sands of time.
		      
		

		
		One by one thy duties wait thee,
		Let thy whole strength go to each;
		Let no future dreams elate thee,       
		Learn thou first what these can teach.
		      
		

	
	
		      FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES.

		
		Count that day lost whose low descending sun
		Views from thy hand no worthy action done.
		       Robart.
		

		
		Honor and shame from no condition rise;
		Act well your part; there all the honor lies.
		       Pope.
		

		
		Success does not consist in never making
		blunders, but in never making the same one
		a second time.
		       Shaw.
		

		
		Whatever is worth doing at all is worth
		doing well.
		       Chesterfield.
		

		
		One cannot always be a hero, but one can
		always be a man.
		       Goethe.
		

		
		The heights by great men reached and kept,
		Were not attained by sudden flight;
		But they, while their companions slept,
		Were toiling upward in the night.
		       Longfellow.
		

		
		      All that       s great and good is done
		Just by patient trying.
		       Ph       be Cary.
		

		
		No star is lost we ever once have seen:
		We always may be what we might have been.
		       Adelaide Proctor.
		

		
		Often in a wooden house a golden room
		we find.
		       Longfellow.
		

		
		Too much of joy is sorrowful,
		So cares must needs abound,
		The vine that bears too many flowers
		Will trail upon the ground.
		       Alice Cary.
		

		
		Life is too short for aught but high
		endeavor.
		       Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
		

		
		To climb steep hills requires slow pace at
		first.
		       Shakespeare.
		

		
		Cloud and sun together make the year;
		Without some storms no rainbow could appear.
		       Alice Cary.
		

		
		The noblest service comes from nameless hands,
		And the best servant does his work unseen.
		       Oliver Wendell Holmes.
		

		
		      He who seeks to pluck the stars
		Will lose the jewels at his feet.
		       Ph       be Cary.
		

		
		For he who is honest is noble,
		Whatever his fortunes or birth.
		       Alice Cary.
		

		
		There       s never a leaf or a blade too mean
		To be some happy creature       s palace.
		       James Russell Lowell.
		

		
		No endeavor is in vain.
		Its reward is in the doing;
		And the rapture of pursuing
		Is the prize the vanquished gain.
		       Longfellow.
		

		
		Press on! if once and twice thy feet
		Slip back and stumble, harder try.
		       Benjamin.
		

		
		Dare to do right; dare to be true;
		The failings of others can never save you;
		Stand by your conscience, your honor, your faith       
		Stand like a hero, and battle till death!
		      
		

		
		He that is slow to anger is better than the
		mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than
		he that taketh a city.
		       Bible.
		

		
		      He prayeth best who loveth best
		All things, both great and small;
		For the dear God who loveth us,
		He made and loveth all.
		       Coleridge.
		

		
		Hours are golden links, God       s token,
		Reaching heaven, but one by one
		Take them; lest the chain be broken
		Ere the pilgrimage be done.
		       A. A. Proctor.
		

		
		There is a lesson in each flower,
		A story in each stream and bower;
		On every herb on which we tread,
		Are written words which, rightly read,
		Will lead us from earth       s fragrant sod
		To hope and holiness and God.
		      
		

		
		Oh, many a shaft at random sent,
		Finds mark the archer little meant!
		And many a word at random spoken,
		May soothe, or wound, a heart that       s broken.
		       Scott.
		
	
	
		      SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADES.

		
		To thine own self be true,
		And it must follow, as the night the day,
		Thou canst not then be false to any man.
		       Shakespeare.
		

		
		Be noble! and the nobleness that lies
		In other men, sleeping but never dead,
		Will rise in majesty to meet thine own.
		       Lowell.
		

		
		What must of necessity be done, you can
		always find out how to do.
		       Ruskin.
		

		
		He fails not who makes truth his cause,
		Nor bends to win the crowd       s applause,
		He fails not       he who stakes his all
		Upon the right and dares to fall.
		       Richard Watson Gilder.
		

		
		Trust no Future, howe       er pleasant!
		Let the dead Past bury its dead!
		Act,       act in the living Present!
		Heart within and God o       erhead!
		       Longfellow.
		

		
		      Tell me not in mournful numbers,
		Life is but an empty dream!
		For the soul is dead that slumbers,
		And things are not what they seem.
		       Longfellow.
		

		
		Be just and fear not; let all the ends thou
		aimest at, be thy country       s, thy God       s, and
		truth       s.
		       Shakespeare.
		

		
		For of all sad words of tongue or pen       
		The saddest are these:        It might have been!       
		       Whittier.
		

		
		Truth crushed to earth shall rise again;
		The eternal years of God are hers;
		But error, wounded, writhes with pain,
		And dies among his worshippers.
		       Bryant.
		

		
		Flower in the crannied wall,
		I pluck you out of the crannies;       
		Hold you here, root and all, in my hand,
		Little flower,       but if I could understand
		What you are, root and all       and all in all,
		I should know what God and man is.
		       Tennyson.
		

		
		Life is the beat possible thing we can
		make of it.
		       Curtis.
		

		
		      Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,
		And asks no omen but his country       s cause.
		       Pope.
		

		
		There       s a divinity that shapes our ends,
		Rough-hew them how we will.
		       Shakespeare.
		

		
		To be, or not to be: that is the question:
		Whether        tis nobler in the mind to suffer
		The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
		Or to take up arms against a sea of troubles,
		And by opposing, end them?
		       Shakespeare.
		

		
		Whatever makes men good Christians,
		makes them good citizens.
		       Webster.
		

		
		Our grand business is, not to see what lies
		dimly at a distance, but to do what lies
		clearly at hand.
		       Thomas Carlyle.
		

		
		With malice toward none, with charity for
		all, with firmness in the right as God gives
		us to see the right.
		       Lincoln.
		

		
		      Full many a gem of purest ray serene
		The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear;
		Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
		And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
		       Gray.
		
	
	
		POOR RICHARD       S SAYINGS.


		God helps them that help themselves.

		The sleeping fox catches no poultry.

		What we call time enough always proves
		little enough.

		Sloth makes all things difficult, but industry
		all easy.

		Drive thy business, let not that drive thee.

		Early to bed and early to rise, makes a
		man healthy, wealthy, and wise.

		Industry needs not wish.

		He that lives upon hope will die fasting.

		He that hath a trade hath an estate, and
		he that hath a calling hath an office of profit
		and honor.

		Have you somewhat to do to-morrow, do
		it to-day.

		      God gives all things to industry: then
		plough deep while sluggards sleep, and you
		will have corn to sell and to keep.

		Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep
		thee.

		If you would have your business done, go;
		if not, send.

		
		He that by the plough would thrive,
		Himself must either hold or drive.
		

		Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets put
		out the kitchen fire.

		For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for
		want of a shoe the horse was lost; and for
		want of a horse the rider was lost.

		Many a little makes a mickle.

		Fools make feasts, and wise men eat them.

		Wise men learn by others        harms, fools
		scarcely by their own.

		When the well is dry they know the worth
		of water.

		Pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a
		great deal more saucy.

		      A little neglect may breed great mischief.

		
		Vessels large may venture more,
		But little boats should keep near shore.
		

		
		What is a butterfly? at best
		He       s but a caterpillar drest;
		The gaudy fop       s his picture just.
		

		For age and want save while you may.

		No morning sun lasts a whole day.

		Rather go to bed supperless than rise in
		debt.

		Get what you can, and what you get, hold,
		       Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold.

		Experience keeps a dear school; but fools
		will learn in no other, and scarce in that;
		for it is true we may give advice, but we
		cannot give conduct.

		The key, often used, is always bright.

		But dost thou love life? then do not waste
		time, for that       s the stuff life is made of.

		Lost time is never found again.

		There are no gains without pains.

		      At the workingman       s house hunger looks
		in, but dares not enter.

		Diligence is the mother of good luck.

		The cat in gloves catches no mice.

		By industry and patience the mouse ate
		into the cable.

		Since thou art not sure of a minute, throw
		not away an hour.

		A workingman on his legs is higher than a
		gentleman on his knees.

		It is folly for the frog to swell in order to
		equal the ox.

		It is easier to build two chimneys than to
		keep one in fuel.

		A fool and his money are soon parted.

		Troubles spring from idleness, and grievous
		toils from needless ease.

		If you would be wealthy think of saving
		as well as of getting.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
