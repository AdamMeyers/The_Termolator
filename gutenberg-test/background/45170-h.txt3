  Foreword

  Of the books which preceded the invention of Printing, a much larger quantity is still extant
  than the world in general would suppose, but they are nevertheless so widely scattered and so
  seldom immediately accessible, that only a very long experience will enable any one to speak or to
  write about them in other than a blundering fashion. So many qualifications are required, that it
  may seem presumptuous in me to treat upon a matter bristling with difficulties and uncertainties.
  The brief but admirable outline of its history which Mr. Maunde Thompson has lately published is
  likely to mislead the inexperienced into a belief that a science defined with so much clearness
  and apparent ease may as easily be mastered. No one knows better than that accomplished scholar
  how hard it would be to supply sure and definite criteria for the guidance of palæographical
  students in all the branches of their fascinating pursuit. My excuse must be that the observations
  which appear in the present opusculum may be useful to some who are unable for various reasons to
  give the necessary fulness of {2}study to Mr. Thompson's
  work, and who, while loving manuscripts as well as I do, have not had so large an experience. I
  may venture to justify myself by a personal anecdote. The author of the "Stones of Venice" once
  said that he was surprised by my apparently exact knowledge of the commercial value of
  manuscripts; and my reply was that, as I had for twenty years been the buyer of, or the
  underbidder for, all the fine examples which had appeared in the public auctions, there was no
  great reason for his wonder.

  The following sketch will consist of a number of cursory remarks upon the
  calligraphy and the ornamentation of medieval manuscripts; preceded by an historical sketch,
  arranged in chronological paragraphs, of the beginnings and the gradual diffusion of the art of
  writing throughout the world.

  The Beginnings of Writing

  Palæography is the branch of science which deals with ancient writing ( span
  title="palaia graphê" class="fsn">&pi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&#x1F70;
  &gamma;&rho;&alpha;&phi;&#x1F75;). As the Greek word for writing comprises a great deal
  more than the work of pen and ink, palæographical study would be imperfect if it did not take into
  consideration the ancient inscriptions upon stone and metal which are usually left to numismatists
  and other archæologists. In a small treatise like the present, no such ambitious and comprehensive
  treatment is intended. The object is mainly to summarise the results of other men's labour, and to
  give a general idea of what is known at the present day about the diffusion of the art of writing
  and the methods of producing books before the sixteenth century.

  The name for book in various ancient languages is indicative of the earliest stage in
  the history of writing. The English word itself appears in its oldest written form in the Gothic
  Scriptures of the fourth century, in which boka = writing, and bokos = things
  written = books. This is {3}believed to be derived from
  the name of the tree we call beech and the Germans buche, because it is supposed
  that the bark or wood of that tree was used for cutting runes upon. Similar to this is the Latin
  liber, which originally meant the inner bark of a tree, and afterwards came to mean book,
  because leaves were made from that inner bark for the purpose of writing. Diphthera, in
  ancient Ionic-Greek, was equivalent to book, because it meant a polished skin (like parchment or
  leather) used for writing upon before the Greeks adopted papyrus (byblos, biblos)
  from the Egyptians. Then the name for papyrus became the name for a book, and has been retained in
  modern speech in the word Bible. The word diphthera passed into use among the Persians
  about five hundred years before Christ, as the material was borrowed by them from the Ionians for
  the use of the scribes who kept the royal records, and it still remains in the speech of the
  modern Persians as defter = book. The Hebrew word sepher = engraving, and is
  therefore used to designate a book; and the same sense underlies the Arabic word Kitab.
  Writing was a scratching or incising of symbols representing sounds (or ideas) upon stone or
  metal, upon wood, or bark, or leaves (folia), dressed leather, parchment, papyrus, wax tablets,
  and paper.

  The form in which the sheets (of skin, parchment, bark, papyrus, or paper) were gathered, may
  have been rolls in which they were united to form a single page, or a square combination of
  successive leaves united only at one side. The former was of course the earlier mode, but the
  latter was also in use at a remote date. Greek and Roman scribes had evidently begun to prefer the
  square fashion during the early days of the Roman empire; and we may take it to have become the
  prevalent custom in the fourth century. Black ink has always been in use for writing, red and blue
  ink are of comparatively recent date. The use of gold ink, which was of course so costly that it
  could never be otherwise than rare, originated probably when the empire was as  span
  class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}yet unshaken by barbarian inroads; it was, however, not
  extinct in Rome during the sixth and seventh centuries, and was relatively not uncommon at the
  magnificent court of Byzantium. Late examples were produced in Gaul for the Frankish princes in
  the ninth century; and in these the simple splendour of the Roman style was embellished with
  ornamentation chiefly drawn from Irish and Anglo-Saxon models.

  Although people knew how to write and to read more than five thousand years ago, "a
  reading public," as we understand the term, came into existence for the first time in Greece in
  the fifth century B.C., and again in Rome in the first century  span
  class="smaller">B.C. By this it is meant that there were people who bought books for the
  pleasure of reading them, as distinguished from the class which produced or used books as an
  official necessity. The requirements of that reading public among the Greeks, led to the disuse of
  skins for the purpose of writing, since only a cheaper and more plentiful material could satisfy
  the demand. Egyptian papyrus being both cheap and plentiful, it was adopted and remained in use
  for over a thousand years among the people who spoke Greek and Latin. Books upon vellum or
  parchment&mdash;charta pergamena, an improved form of the old skins&mdash;were only
  produced occasionally, as luxuries, between the second century B.C.
  and the fifth century of our era. At this latter period, the reading public was extinguished in
  the revolutions of barbarian conquest, and the cheap material ceased to be necessary. In the
  absence of a popular demand for books, and when only persons of exceptional learning, churchmen,
  statesmen, and monks, experienced the need of reading and writing, the supply of vellum was
  sufficient, and this dearer material was relatively economical because of its durability. A
  reading public can hardly be said to have come into renewed existence till the fifteenth century,
  and then once more vellum was superseded by the cheaper material of paper. Paper, from linen or
  rags, had been made in the {5}Saracenic east for several
  centuries, but was little used in Europe till the thirteenth century, and was not fabricated in
  the west to any considerable extent until the fourteenth century.

  Writing in Egypt 5000 B.C.

  The origin of writing, that is of the art of transmitting information by means of
  symbols representing speech, is, like the origin of every other invention, obscure and uncertain.
  It is not the proud Aryan, nor his elder brother the Semite, who can claim the honour of the
  invention. It belongs neither to Japhet nor to Shem (convenient eponyms) but to the despised Ham,
  with whom they are unwilling to acknowledge kinship. Four thousand years before Christ (the very
  period at which, in Milton's opinion, Adam and Eve were banished from Paradise) the people of the
  Nile Valley formed a rich and powerful monarchy, with an old civilisation, and possessed the arts
  of painting, sculpture, architecture, and writing. Their writing was chiefly upon stone monuments,
  and recorded the deeds of their Kings or the greatness of their Gods. They also wrote upon leaves
  of papyrus the forms of prayer and eulogy which were buried with their dead. Among the surviving
  written productions of that great monarchy is a work containing the Moral Precepts of Ptah-Hotep.
  Written in the language of Khem (old Egypt), and in the hieratic character, upon papyrus, it is
  "the oldest book in the world." The period of its composition is more ancient than the date of the
  writing, which, by internal evidence, has been proved to be over 2000  span
  class="smaller">B.C. It is now in the Bibliothèque Nationale, and is known by the name of
  the Papyrus Prisse. As there can be no question that hieroglyphic writing (engraving) upon stone
  was considerably anterior to the evolution of the cursive hieratic written with pen and ink upon
  papyrus; and as there is a hieroglyphic inscription on stone in the Ashmolean Museum  span
  class="pagenum" id="page6">{6}which is assigned to 4000  span
  class="smaller">B.C.&mdash;we must infer that the real age of Egyptian writing is beyond
  our ken. It must be at the least six thousand years old; and there are numerous examples in
  lapidar inscriptions which represent the millennium preceding the date of the Prisse Papyrus. With
  this book, written several centuries before Moses dwelt in the land of Egypt, a sketch of the
  history of writing may modestly begin. It must not be imagined that the dates of Egyptian and
  Babylonian documents are based upon enthusiastic conjecture, or upon unaided calculation of the
  years assigned to the lives and reigns of monarchs in their newly discovered and deciphered
  records. Josephus and Eusebius have preserved fragments of older historical writers, among them
  portions of the lost Chronicles of Berossus the Chaldæan and Manetho the Egyptian, whose works
  were written in Greek in the fourth and third centuries before Christ. In former days, when
  scholars were nurtured upon the Christian chronology which counted the birth of Christ as  span
  class="smaller">A.M. 4004, or A.M. 5870, according as the
  Hebrew Bible or the Septuagint was adopted as the authority for dates, it was the custom to deride
  as fabulous the immense lists of Chaldean and Egyptian dynasties, which spoiled the story of
  Genesis; but the hieroglyphic and the cuneiform monuments have yielded up their long-buried
  testimony to justify the discredited chroniclers. Nothing in romance is more wonderful than the
  story of the work of interpretation, by which old Egypt and old Assyria have been brought forward
  into the light of authentic history. Two generations of acute and patient scholars working
  contemporaneously in England, France, Germany, and Italy, have contrived, without dictionary,
  without grammar, without even a key to the mysterious letters, to decipher and to read the stony
  records of those ancient empires. Their first labour was to distinguish the symbols, and to assign
  to them a phonetic value, then to compare the resultant words with the vocabulary of known
  languages supposed to be akin to the old {7}ones. In the
  case of the hieroglyphics, the Coptic language alone offered its aid, this being the tongue of
  Egypt as written and spoken in the first ten centuries of our era, genuine Egyptian indeed, but
  necessarily differing enormously from its earliest phases thousands of years back. As to the
  cuneiform inscriptions, the various Semitic tongues furnished means of comparison for Assyrian
  texts, the Persian and "Zend" for old Persic and Median, and certain cuneiform vocabularies were
  discovered which rendered it possible to understand a third language, the most ancient of them
  all, which had been utterly unknown even by name. From the time of Christ, perhaps even before it,
  down to sixty years ago, the languages and monuments of Egypt and Chaldæa had never been looked
  upon by the eye of intelligence. The mystery of ages is a mystery no more.

  Writing in Chaldæa, 4000 B.C.

  The age of Chaldæan writing (engraving) is not far behind that of the Egyptian
  hieroglyphics. It is said that an inscription of the first Sargon, King of Akkad (in the square or
  angular character out of which the wedge-shaped or cuneiform letters were evolved), carries the
  record back to 3800 B.C. Even if we take a large latitude in
  discounting the chronology, there still remains a certainty that the cuneiform character of
  Babylonia was used over the greater part of Western Asia from at least 2500  span
  class="smaller">B.C., and in Persia and its tributaries down to 300  span
  class="smaller">B.C. While, of the Egyptian writing, we have remains exhibiting all the
  stages of development, namely (1) the hieroglyphic, (2) the hieratic, (3) the demotic, (4) the
  Coptic in Greek letters; of the cuneiform script we have only the two phases which may be roughly
  said to correspond to the Egyptian hieratic and demotic, or more exactly to two stages of the
  hieratic. We cannot reconstruct the original Chaldæan hieroglyphics which must have preceded the
  Chaldæan hieratic and {8}cuneiform; nor do we know (at
  present) of any truly cursive hand developed from the wedge-letters. Among the relics of the
  Assyrians is a great number of stone tablets of small size, containing reports to the monarch from
  provincial governors. One of them, now in the British Museum, is supposed, from a phrase which
  occurs in it, to show that the stone tablets were simply copies made for preservation in the
  archives, while the actually transmitted originals were written on papyrus. If that were the
  practice, and there is inherent probability in the suggestion, there would assuredly have been a
  great quantity of papyrus used throughout the Assyrian empire; yet not a fragment of that material
  has been discovered. In the absence of some positive evidence, we can but suppose it likely that
  the Assyrians used papyrus (or skins) for writing on, as well as the Egyptians, but applied it
  only to temporary purposes, trusting rather to granite and brick, than to paper or to leather,
  whatever was intended for enduring record.

  Progress of the Art, B.C. 2500-1500

  At about 2500 B.C. all the civilisation of the world was confined
  to the regions bordering the whole length of the Red Sea, and extending northwards to Armenia. In
  the South was Egypt, a powerful monarchy dominant at times from Ethiopia to Asia Minor, and in the
  North the Chaldee kingdom of Akkad dominant over Mesopotamia and the frontier lands. The country
  of Egypt was named by its people Keme or Kheme, and their language was called the speech of Keme
  (out of which the Hebrews made Ham). The name of Ai-Gupt was given to the Delta by its Semitic
  neighbours and inhabitants, while they called the whole country Mizr (Mizraim) or Misr. The former
  name has prevailed in European use, as well as furnished the words Copt and Coptic, although this
  is questionable. The Kheme language was written both in hieroglyphic and in hieratic  span
  class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}characters at the year 2500 B.C.
  The former were the ancient picture-symbols, which were arranged in vertical columns and read from
  top to bottom and from left to right. This practice was retained to the end, notwithstanding that
  the Egyptians had been long in contemporaneous possession of the cursive hieratic characters,
  written in horizontal lines from right to left, just as Hebrew and Arabic. The hieratic character
  was simply an abridgment of the  span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'hieratic'">hieroglyphic, a reduction of the pictorial to
  conventional forms.

  The two scripts endured side by side till Christianity supervened, and then the modified Greek
  alphabet which we call the Coptic came into existence. The demotic script, a still more cursive
  reduction of the hieratic, had come into use probably a thousand years  span
  class="smaller">B.C., but it was only used for private mercantile transactions, and it died
  out on the establishment of the Coptic. Examples of both hieroglyphic and demotic writing are
  given in the plates accompanying this sketch.

  The Akkadian Chaldee language (to be distinguished from the later Semitic Syro-Chaldee) has,
  like the Egyptian Khemi, no immediate affinities with any other important form of speech. They are
  both of an older type and stock than the oldest known members of the Aryan and Semitic families.
  The Akkadian is called Turanian, as showing undoubted resemblances to the Turki and Mongol
  languages of the lands lying north and east of Persia, which were named by the Persians Turan, as
  distinguished from Iran. The place of the Khemi in philology is not so easily defined. It does not
  seem that any other language than that of Egypt was ever written in the Egyptian script. The case
  is somewhat different with the Chaldee characters. They were adopted in varying modes for writing
  Semitic and Aryan languages, as well as the native Akkadian. This resulted from the blending of
  populations by successive conquests. The Akkadian-Chaldees ruled in Mesopotamia till 1500  span
  class="smaller">B.C., when they went down before the Semites from Northern Arabia.  span
  class="pagenum" id="page10">{10}A branch of these Semites had already for a considerable
  time occupied the eastern side of Mesopotamia and were in possession of the region round Nineveh,
  at the time when their Arabian kindred swept away the old dynasty that had had its chief seat in
  Babylonia.

  At or about 1300 B.C., the Ninevite Assyrians or
  Syro-Chaldæans united the whole of Mesopotamia by conquest, and completed the downfall of the
  Akkadian Chaldæans who were thenceforward reduced to servitude. Even the later uprisings in
  Babylonia were only the work of princes of Assyrian blood. The date mentioned is another
  standpoint in the history of writing. The Semite Assyrians were now the chief users of the
  cuneiform script. At Babylon they seem to have retained it in the same form into which it had
  developed in the hands of the Akkad people. At Nineveh, it had undergone a modification; the
  combinations of the symbols being considerably altered, so that one may speak of Babylonian
  characters and of Assyrian characters as being two scripts, although they look identical.

  The Semitic Alphabet about 1700 B.C.

  This is (in chronological sequence) the place at which mention should be made of the Greek myth
  that alphabetical letters were introduced into B&#x0153;otia by Cadmus the Ph&#x0153;nician. It
  has always been accepted as substantially true, even by those who knew that Cadmus in Semitic
  speech meant simply The Ancient, or The Eastern; and has usually been assigned to about 1500  span
  class="smaller">B.C. The story requires some modification, and the date is probably a good
  deal out of reckoning. Here it is only referred to as showing the early use of letters by the
  Ph&#x0153;nicians. There are really no extant monuments to prove the anteriority of the Semite
  alphabet to that of the Greeks, but there can be no question as to the fact. The names of the
  Greek letters are manifestly borrowed from a Semitic speech, and the Cadmus story is in  span
  class="pagenum" id="page11">{11}itself a sufficient acknowledgment of the secondary
  position of the Hellenes. It is generally held that the Ph&#x0153;nicians derived their alphabet
  by means of a selection from the phonetic symbols of the Egyptian hieratic script. Whether the
  process was due to the Ph&#x0153;nicians themselves, is not so clearly asserted. Mr. Maunde
  Thompson, following Lenormant and the Vicomte de Rougé, seems to consider that it gradually took
  place in Egypt after the Arabs had conquered the country, and when the Hyksos or Shepherd Kings
  had established their dynasty (2000 B.C.). During the five hundred
  years of their rule there must have been a large Semitic immigration, and it is not unlikely that
  the Semitic alphabet was then derived from the Egyptian for the use of the Syrians and Arabs who
  dwelt in Lower Egypt. There is, on the other hand, a modern theory that the Semitic alphabet was
  not evolved in this way, but from the hieratic Babylonian writing. It is true that similarities
  may be found between them, and it is also demonstrable that the Greek names of the alphabet were
  drawn from the speech, not of Ph&#x0153;nicia or Palestine, but of Aram or Semitic Chaldæa.
  Nothing is certain as to the origin of the Semitic alphabet, notwithstanding the elaborate
  comparative tables produced by Rougé and others, beyond the fact that several letters resemble
  Egyptian (and Chaldæo-Assyrian) symbols having sometimes the same phonetic value. The names given
  to their characters by the Semites are undoubtedly descriptive of their apparent iconism, and the
  initial sound of each name is the power of the letter. This, on the face of it, would imply that
  the Aramaic alphabet was an original invention. The Greeks who first received it, must have been
  those of Asia Minor, not those of Hellas; and the first transmitters were neither Arabs, nor Jews,
  nor Ph&#x0153;nicians, but Babylonian Aramæans in contact with Cilicia and Cappadocia. The names
  of the letters, as sounded by the Syrians of Palestine (Ph&#x0153;nicians, Israelites, Jews),
  were: Aleph, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, He, Vau, Zain
  (Zai), Hheth (Kheth), Teth, Yod,  span class="pagenum"
  id="page12">{12}Caph, Lamed, Mem (maim=waters),
  Nun, Samekh, Ain (Oin), Pe, Tsade, Koph,
  Resh (=head), Shin, Tau.

  We have no actual knowledge of the Chaldæo-Aramaic sounds of these names, but we know that the
  Eastern Syrians would probably have written them thus:&mdash;

  Alpha, Beta, Gamla, Dalta, He, Vau, Zaita,
  Hheta, Teta, Yoda, Kappa, Lamda, Mu (=water),
  Nun (Nu), Samkha (Simkha=Sigma), Oin (Oi?),
  Pe, Tsada, Koppa, Rash (Ro?=face), Shen,
  Tau.

  Leaving aside for the present any consideration of the changes and additions in the Greek
  alphabet, we may assume that it passed from Babylonia through Cilicia to the Phrygians and
  Lydians; and that, whatever intercourse may have taken place between the European Greeks and the
  Ph&#x0153;nicians then or afterwards, the Ionians of Asia Minor had already formulated the
  Hellenic alphabet before it reached the Thebans. As it seems to be nearly certain that the
  Phrygians possessed it in the tenth century before Christ, the Aramæans must have had it much
  earlier, and we may credit them with the use of writing as far back as 1300-1200  span
  class="smaller">B.C. It is very unlikely that the Western Syrians were far behind, but the
  oldest monuments extant go no higher than the tenth century, and are probably surpassed in
  antiquity by some of the Sabæan (Himyarite or Homerite) inscriptions of Southern Arabia. The
  Himyari alphabet, which is the direct ancestor of the modern Abyssinian, introduces some novel
  forms, and has less resemblance to the Aramaic original than any of the others. Most of the
  letters are, however, ultimately traceable to the Aramaic, although the date must have been
  remote, to judge from the large divergences in shape which had had time to develop themselves
  before the type was fixed.

  About, or soon after, 1000 B.C., we find a
  considerable portion of the earth's surface occupied by people knowing how to write; namely,
  Egypt, Nubia, Abyssinia, Arabia, the whole of Asia Minor, Syria, Babylonia, Assyria, Armenia,
  {13}and China. Abyssinia and Armenia are included because
  into the one country Egyptian and Himyaritic characters had been imported, and into the other a
  form of Babylonian. China is placed in the list, far below her pretensions, because we do not
  really know the age of the character in which Chinese books preserve the inscriptions of Yu. It
  appears derivable from the dissertations of M. Terrien, whose sagacious learning has attracted
  many scholars, that the earliest history recorded in Chinese annals is not geographically Chinese;
  but that it represents the legends and traditions which were carried into China by the ancestors
  of the race. A connexion has been found to subsist between those traditions and the early history
  of Babylonia, which leads to the inference that the Akkadian people of 3800  span
  class="smaller">B.C. and the ancestors of the Chinese were at one time united. Assuming
  that the theory is justifiable, we may treat the Chinese in China as having inherited the art of
  writing, however strangely altered in form. It is probably true that they used the letters out of
  which their present characters descended, in the country they now inhabit, at more than 1000  span
  class="smaller">B.C.

  The Alphabet in European Greece, 800 B.C.

  The European Greeks are not included in the preceding paragraph, simply because
  there are no means of proving that they had the use of letters in the tenth century  span
  class="smaller">B.C. The probability, however, is that they were not far behind their
  brethren in Asia Minor. The variations in the forms of some of the letters of the Greek alphabet
  which are found in inscriptions at different places both in Asia Minor and in Greece, are
  attributable to local fashions and to the fact that the script was not built up all at once from a
  single model. It is here that the tradition about Cadmus has its chief significance; for there can
  be little doubt that the alphabet of Tyre, not quite identical with its elder Aramaic  span
  class="pagenum" id="page14">{14}sister, had some immediate influence in modifying the forms
  borrowed by the B&#x0153;otians from the Ionians. The older Greek alphabet has been already
  mentioned. It was found after a while to be both insufficient and more than sufficient. The Tsade
  (ts) and Koppa (q) were not needed in Greek, and were only retained formally as numerals. As most
  Greek organs could only give the same sound (s) to both the simkha and the shen
  (which they called sigma and san), one of the two names was superfluous. So they
  kept the symbol for shen as an s, but transferred to it the name of the
  simkha. The symbol of the latter they retained in its place, but sounded it as ks, and
  called it Ksi, a name which did not badly suit the original Semitic sound of the letter
  which was like hs rather than s. The unaspirated He they called mere E
  (E psilon); to the aspirated Heta, they left its name, but regarded it as aspirated
  E. Its original Semitic value as an aspirate (adaptable to any vowel) was not wholly lost
  sight of, and this idea of its power survived the stage at which H had become nothing more than
  ê or ee. The necessity of making aspirated letters led to the prefixing or
  over-writing of the H, at first in its full size, then (so as to avoid confusion with Eta)
  in small, then in half shape, thus .
  This custom produced its complement in the shape of  img src="images/symbol02.png"
  style="width:0.7em;" alt="-|"/>, to mark the soft breathing; until in the eleventh century of our
  era, the two breathings were worn down into semicircular form, thus  img src="images/symbol03.png"
  style="width:0.5em;" alt="("/> , .
  Another rejected symbol was the vau, formed like the letter F and sounded like our V. It
  dropped out of usage, and they forgot its name, although it had been considerably used by the old
  poets, in connexion with whom it is usually named digamma, because of its resemblance to a
  double gamma, or one gamma superimposed on another. It was found necessary to have a character for
  u, and advantageous to use single symbols for double letters frequently occurring, such as
  ph, kh, ps and oo (long o). The old Eastern form of vau
  supplied the u; in fact, having dropped the letter as a consonant out of its sixth place in
  {15}the alphabet, they put it in its vowel-character at
  the end. The symbol of the discarded koppa was used for the Ph, which was not
  equivalent in sound to our ph, but must have resembled the German pf. The discarded
  tsada (a trident) was used to represent, in some places ps, in others kh, but
  finally the symbol fell into two distinct forms, by being written upright as + ( span title="ps"
  class="fsn">&psi;) and leaning sidewise as × (&chi;).
  By the time of Herodotus the Greek alphabet may be considered as having reached exactly its
  present form in capital letters. The cursive hand which must have existed at all times of Greek
  writing was simply a rapid deformation of the capitals, and consequently did not attain to any
  uniformly distinctive character till much later. The general use of minuscules in any such uniform
  type is always referred to the eighth century after Christ, but really there is no essential
  change of form between the cursive letters a hundred years before Christ and those of a thousand
  years after Christ. The chief difference is in the greater freedom and fluency of the late
  letters, an air of practised familiarity which is lacking in the earlier cursive.

  Writing in Italy from 700 to 100 B.C.

  The Greeks and the Ph&#x0153;nicians had a similar aptitude for establishing
  colonies abroad to that which the English have shown during the past three centuries. Thus the
  coast line of the Mediterranean from Tripoli to Morocco, and from Sicily and Southern Italy to
  Spain and Gaul, was dotted with Punic and Greek settlements created for purely commercial
  purposes, but gaining an independent importance as time went on. The chief seat of
  Ph&#x0153;nician domination was at Carthage; of Greek nationality at Syracuse, Cumæ (near Naples),
  and Marseilles. The age at which those colonies acquired political greatness may be roughly set
  down as in the fourth century before Christ, but it is sufficient for our purpose to know that
  they had been founded considerably {16}earlier; and that
  the art of writing had been carried westward as far back at least as the seventh or eighth century
  B.C. It was virtually the one alphabet, applied by various races to
  their various languages, which was used at Carthage and Cadiz, at Marseilles and in Sicily and
  Italy, in the seventh century B.C. Italy was occupied by several
  distinct sets of people. The Umbrians, Latins, and Oscans occupied all the middle of the
  peninsula; the Pelasgic tribes who were in the heel and toe of the geographical boot were nearly
  Grecised; the Etruscans held Tuscany, and Celts occupied Lombardy. Mommsen thought that the Greek
  alphabet had reached the Italians more than 1300 years before Christ; but a more modest estimate
  will be safer. It was probably about seven hundred years B.C. when
  the Etrurians received their alphabet from the Greeks; and there is no reason for thinking, as
  Mommsen implies, that their first contact with Greek letters had been elsewhere than in Italy. The
  alphabet reached them no doubt from Cumæ, as it did the Latins, and there was sufficient variation
  in the practice of the Greek colonies in Italy to account for the differences which mark Etruscan,
  Umbrian, and Latin writing.

  Roman Writing.

  The usual date of the founding of Rome is undoubtedly correct or nearly so. It was
  about the middle of the eighth century B.C., and the rapid
  enlargement of the new Latin town on the Tiber, produced by the influx of settlers into a trade
  emporium with waterway, must have led to an early use of writing. This indicates something like
  700 B.C. for the period of the extension of that art over the whole
  of Italy. The custom of writing from right to left and left to right in alternate lines was
  retained for several centuries among the various Italic peoples, but the Latins seem to have been
  the first to adopt the Greek modification by which  span class="pagenum"
  id="page17">{17}the letters took their permanent shape from the left-right sequence. In
  several Greek towns, the old &Gamma; was replaced by a C (the
  result of a cursive mode of writing), and the triangular  span title="D"
  class="fsn">&Delta; had its second and third lines represented by a single curve. The  span
  title="P" class="fsn">&Pi; was still a  img src="images/symbol05.png" style="width:0.8em;"
  alt="[Symbol: P not connected in the middle]"/>, and the P had a little stroke added to it ( img
  src="images/symbol06.png" style="width:0.8em;" alt="[Symbol: R with short tail]"/>) for the sake
  of distinction. The Sigma was commonly written  img src="images/symbol07.png" style="width:0.9em;"
  alt="[Symbol: reverse tilted Z]"/> instead of  img src="images/symbol08.png" style="width:0.5em;"
  alt="[Symbol: reverse 3]"/> (&Sigma;). The Latins omitted of
  course such letters as they found superfluous (z, th, k, ph,
  ch, ps, and oo), but were naturally bound to retain letters already becoming
  superfluous to the Greeks (F, Q). The third letter of the alphabet was used for both K and G; but
  later, when the need of some differentiation became felt, the useless Z was replaced by a second C
  to which a tail was added ( img src="images/symbol09.png" style="width:1.0em;" alt="[Symbol: C
  with diagonal tail]"/>). The Eta (or Heta) was made to retain its earliest function as a strong
  breathing (H), although the Greeks were treating it as no more than EE. The Greek confusion
  between the symbols for ks, ps, and ch, affected the Latins so far that one
  of the three letters, i.e. X, was taken to represent the only sound of the three which
  their language needed, namely ks; and this being an afterthought, it was put at the end of
  the alphabet. Thus in the second century B.C. the Romans had their
  alphabet completely formed in the capital shapes, and with the phonetic values, which it
  thenceforward retained. The letters were A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V,
  X, the F being sounded probably as our V and F, the V as our U and W. It was long afterwards that
  the F was restricted to the sound of English F, and V as a consonant took the sound of English V
  (instead of W.) The Q was a more guttural letter than the C originally, but afterwards lost its
  distinctiveness of utterance. When it became fashionable to learn and quote Greek, in the time of
  Cicero and after, the letters &Kappa;,  span title="U"
  class="fsn">&Upsilon;, and &Zeta; were reinserted in the
  Latin alphabet for form's sake, as K, Y, Z. It was not till the sixteenth century that, in the
  northern countries of Europe, the letter J was evolved from the black letter form  span
  class="pagenum" id="page18">{18}of I ( img src="images/symbol10.png" style="width:0.8em;"
  alt="[Symbol: blackletter I]"/>) and the letter V split into U and V. As for the W, it was needed
  only by Germanic people, and was consequently a late intruder into the modern Roman alphabet.

  Indian Writing about 300 B.C.

  To return to the East, the first examples of native Indian writing appeared in the
  rock-inscribed decrees of Asoka, found in various places over the north of India, from the Indus
  to the Ganges, and even in the Dekkan; which can be dated between 250 and 230  span
  class="smaller">B.C. The language is Prakrit or Pali, the characters (although at first
  sight they seem an independent script) were derived like so many others from the Semitic system,
  and the nearest of the parallel types is the alphabet of the Himyarite inscriptions. The Sabæan
  monarchy which ruled over Southern Arabia a thousand years B.C. had
  had large commercial relations with India, and it was probably from that source that the people of
  Bombay and the North-West acquired the art of writing, how long before Asoka it would be difficult
  to learn. Out of the simple forms of Asoka's alphabet all the modern scripts of Indian native
  writing descended, including the artificial and elaborate Nagari alphabet which is one of the
  latest of them.

  Writing in Central Asia from 300 B.C.

  In the kingdom of Bactria, the coins of the kings who from about 150  span
  class="smaller">B.C. followed the older Greek princes, bear inscriptions in Indian Prakrit,
  but not written in the same character as was used by Asoka. The two scripts differ so much in
  appearance not only from all others, but also between themselves, that one does not easily
  recognise the fact that they both must have been of Himyaritic origin. They are very different
  from the Pehlvi which was used by Parthian sovereigns in the second century after Christ, and by
  the Sassanide kings in the fourth. The {19}Pehlvi had
  been evolved from the later Aramean, and must have been in use in Persia before the time of
  Alexander; but the existing specimens are all subsequent to the beginning of the Christian era.
  And as for the script which is called Zend, and which is used for writing the Zoroastrian books of
  the most ancient Persian language, there is nothing to prove that it is not of much later
  invention than the Pehlvi.

  Oriental Letters after the beginning of the Christian Era

  Samaria.&mdash;The writing of Palestine was probably identical originally with that of
  the Ph&#x0153;nicians, and the Samaritan script, which is still in use for biblical purposes, has
  retained to the present day a considerable resemblance with that of Tyre and Sidon. The
  expatriation and partial repatriation of the Jews and Israelites during the seventh and sixth
  centuries B.C., had the effect of leaving only a small remnant in the
  north of the land who preserved their ancient writing. From that time to this some of the
  descendants of the Samarians have continued to write their Pentateuch (which for them is the whole
  of the Bible) in the ancient characters of the Hebrew language (a specimen is found on  a
  href="#plate4">plate 4). All the rest of the Jews, in whatever part of the world they may have
  been, have retained the square character (with its various Rabbinical modifications) which they
  learned in Chaldæa in the seventh century B.C. But the Hebrew
  language never returned to the Holy Land. Hebrew, as spoken among the Samaritans, underwent the
  same Aramaisation as the language of the Judæans, and from three or four centuries B.C. down to
  the eighth century of our era, the language of all Syria was Syriac with local dialects, and Greek
  in the great cities. The usual character in which Syriac was written has already been mentioned,
  but the Samaritans wrote even their semi-Syriac speech in the old  span class="pagenum"
  id="page20">{20}characters of their Bible; and there is a really Samaritan
  Pentateuch&mdash;different from the Hebrew Pentateuch in Samaritan letters&mdash;which corresponds
  in Samaritan literature to the Chaldee Targums of the Jews. None of the Hebraeo-Aramaic dialects
  long survived in Syria the conquest of the Arabs. Syriac still lived on in Western Persia and in
  Mongolia, and in India for a time, but only survived as a dead liturgical language.
  Chaldæo-Hebraic made its way westwards to Morocco, Italy, Spain and Gaul. The faithful in Samaria,
  now nearly extinct, clung to their Pentateuch and their religion through all vicissitudes, and
  have never ceased to write the Bible in the Hebrew script of ancient Palestine.

  Arabia.&mdash;Arabian writing before the time of Mohammad is only known to us under the
  name of Haurani and Nabathæan in the North, of Himyaritic in the South. None of these scripts
  resembles the Islamic characters called distinctively Arabic. The Gospel-script (Estrangelo) of
  the Syrians is the nearest of all the Aramaic hands to that used by the earliest Mohammadans,
  which (from its special cultivation in the town of Cufa) is called Cufic. But even here, the
  resemblance is not so close as to make it improbable that there was a link between them in some
  lost script of pre-Christian days. The Cufic writing which prevailed for three centuries as the
  mode of writing the Koran cannot strictly be shown to be the mother of the Naskhi which replaced
  it and has flourished for a thousand years. It is clearly older than the Naskhi in its forms, but
  the Naskhi has been proved to have existed contemporaneously with the Cufic almost from the
  beginning of Mohammadanism. After the third century of the Hijra, the Cufic was only retained for
  ornamentation and head-lines. By that time the Arab conquests had created a vast Mohammadan
  empire; the Syrians, the Persians, and the Egyptians were obliged to give up their old scripts,
  and to accept that of their conquerors. Arabic writing occupied not only all  span class="pagenum"
  id="page21">{21}the seats in which Ph&#x0153;nician letters had been used fifteen centuries
  before, but even a far larger area. The writing and the language were used and known from Seville
  to the frontiers of India. Soon after, India likewise fell a prey; and Arabic letters have been
  used there ever since by the Mohammadan population. The elegant script called Talik, which was
  peculiar to the Persians (but has been borrowed in India), was developed in the fourteenth
  century. It differs little, except in gracefulness, from the typical Naskhi.

  India and the further East.&mdash;The characters in which the Pracrit inscriptions of
  Northern India were engraved on stone, in the third century B.C.,
  descended, with considerable modifications of form, to the various tribes of Hindus who developed
  the modern languages of India, now called Hindi, Gujarati, Mahratti, Panjabi, Bengali. All these
  languages are akin, their differences being produced by segregation and by local contact with
  aboriginal or foreign populations. Their character two thousand years ago (before local
  diversities were perpetuated in names) is described by the term Prakrit (=Natural) as
  distinguished from the title given to another form of the language, namely Sanskrit (=Artificial)
  which is believed to represent a far more ancient stage of Indian speech. In this artificial
  language the earliest traditions and literature of the Hindo-Aryan race are preserved, but it is
  supposed to have died out of speech (if ever it was spoken) several centuries before the Christian
  era. However that may be, we have no monument or record to show that it was written till the tenth
  century after Christ, and the Sanscrit alphabet is undeniably not more than eight or nine
  centuries old, having been artificially elaborated from the much simpler script of Asoka's
  time.

  The graphic systems of Southern India, Ceylon, Thibet, Burma, and Siam were all derived from
  the script of Aryan India after Budhism had begun to spread.

  {22}

  In North-Eastern Asia, the Mongolian script (and out of it, the Manchurian) were
  formed from the writing of the Nestorian Christians who carried their Syriac books to the
  frontiers of China.

  Spain and Gaul under the Romans

  It has been already said that Punic settlements were made in Spain probably as far
  back as the seventh century B.C. To the Ph&#x0153;nicians or
  Carthaginians we may ascribe the introduction of letters and their application to coins and
  inscriptions, not only in the Punic language of the men who held Cadiz, Carthagena, and Barcelona,
  but also in the Iberian and Celtiberian language of native princes. Strabo says that the Turdetani
  (of the present Andalusia) boasted the possession of historical and poetical books of immense age
  in their own language; but when he was writing, about the time of the birth of Christ, they were
  all Romanised and unable to speak any other tongue than Latin. There exists, however, a great
  quantity of coins struck in Spain between 400 B.C. and the time of
  Augustus. There are three varieties (omitting those of Greek colonies in Aragon), namely, those in
  Punic language and Punic letters, those with Iberian names in Punic letters, and those with
  Celtiberian names in modified Punic letters. The later Iberian and Celtiberian have sometimes
  Latin inscriptions added to the native ones. In the first century after Christ, the whole of Spain
  was virtually Romanised. The Transalpine Gauls retained their own speech longer than the Spaniards
  did theirs, because the conquest was later; but the people of Cisalpine Gaul were Romanised even
  earlier than the Spaniards. The independence of Marseilles as a Greek republic came to an end in
  the first century of the Roman empire, and the Greek language probably died out in a few
  generations. Then, no doubt, Roman letters took the place of the Greek, which, as Cæsar said, were
  used by the Gauls in his time. Henceforward, till the fifth century, Spain and  span
  class="pagenum" id="page23">{23}Gaul were simply outlying provinces of the empire, without
  anything in literature or calligraphy to distinguish their people from the Romanised Italians. It
  was not till the sixth century, when the Gothic kingdom had become a stable institution, that
  anything like a local fashion of calligraphy began to develop itself in Spain. Gaul was similarly
  affected by the influx first of the Visigoths, then of the Franks.

  Influence of the Bible upon writing

  The events which led to the compilation of the Gospels were of the greatest moment in the
  history of writing. The educational influence of the Bible&mdash;apart entirely from its claims to
  supernatural importance&mdash;in spreading the use of letters and creating schools for the study
  of reading and writing, has been incalculable. The historical and religious traditions of the Jews
  would probably have had but little effect upon the world, if the result of the various wars by
  which Syria was so often desolated had not been to expatriate the chosen people of the Lord. A
  large Jewish population occupied Northern Egypt at the time when Alexander's conquests
  revolutionised the old world. The establishment of Greek dynasties in that country and in Syria
  speedily Hellenised the upper classes and the citizens in both; and the linguistic subjugation of
  the Jews in Egypt was even more complete than that of their old masters. Their peculiar condition
  facilitated a change; for while they possessed the sacred book of the Law of their forefathers in
  a language that had been dead for centuries, they had only translations in the language of the
  country of their former exile (Chaldæa); and though they had the commercial qualification of
  bilingualism, their Chaldee and their Egyptian were probably equally weak. Two generations were
  enough to Hellenise them, and seventy years after Alexander's death, the Bible was introduced to
  the knowledge of the Greek world in an edition destined to render the old Hebrew  span
  class="pagenum" id="page24">{24}scripture intelligible to Egyptian and Syrian Jews. This
  fortunate circumstance drew a number of people into the Elohistic fold who would never otherwise
  have been found there; and had no small influence in bringing about the social and moral
  revolution which signalised the beginning of our era.

  The Septuagint must remain the true Bible of Christendom until the Hebrew text of the
  præ-Christian ages is discovered. Next to it in importance is the Syriac Bible, and next to that,
  the Latin Vulgate. All three indicate the prior existence of a Hebrew original; but to obtain a
  critically exact knowledge of what that original was at the time of Alexander the Great, one must
  resort to the Septuagint; at the time of Christ, to the Syriac; and at the time of the Emperor
  Julian, to the Vulgate. The Hebrew text, as we now have it, underwent so many changes and
  corruptions during the first few centuries of the growth of Christianity as a younger rival to
  Judaism, that even the oldest Hebrew MSS. are precluded by their comparative modernity from
  claiming equal importance with the three versions referred to. The multiplication of copies of the
  Syriac Scriptures, between the first century after Christ and the seventh, must have been very
  great; that of the Greek Bible and Testament, from the first to the fourteenth century, still
  greater; and that of the Latin Vulgate, from the fifth to the fifteenth, enormous. The early
  missionaries of the Christian Church were Hellenised Syrians or Egyptians, and they stamped the
  art of their native countries upon the new Biblical literature in every country except Italy.
  Italy was the exception, simply because it was the centre of political power and of Græco-Roman
  culture, and thus too learned and too fastidious to accept a new popular religion or an inferior
  type of ornamental art. But all the external provinces of the Empire underwent the influence of
  the enthusiastic proselytizers, and even Byzantium succumbed to it after the Empire of the West
  had been extinguished. The types of ornament created for the embellishment of Bibles were Egyptian
  in {25}design and colouring; and this is the reason why
  the pictures in all the early examples of book-illustration in the West are supposed to have a
  Byzantine aspect; the fact being that while classical art faded away almost with paganism in Italy
  and Hellas, the Oriental substitute, which reigned from Asia Minor to Ireland, was preserved in
  Byzantium till the downfall of the Greek empire. A few belated specimens of degenerate classical
  ornament are found to represent the ages between Constantine and Charles the Great; but in general
  terms it may be said that Roman book-illustration died out in the fourth century. It came to life
  again, but in utter metamorphosis, in the decorated Irish books of the sixth-seventh century,
  which were really the first examples of the mediæval art of illumination.

  The Coptic alphabet and the Gothic alphabet were two late and artificial
  inventions, due entirely to a holy rage for producing the Bible in the language of the Egyptians
  and the Goths. The two Slavonic alphabets likewise were late scripts, invented for the purpose of
  translating the Bible into Slovene. The Armenian alphabet (and out of it the Georgian) had a
  similar origin, and seems to have had some relationship to the Slav Glagolitic. They are both
  attributed to the fifth century.

  Writing in Italy during the first five centuries of the Christian era

  We have not as full a knowledge as could be wished for of the ordinary styles of writing under
  the Roman empire. The books of the fourth and fifth centuries which are extant show that
  calligraphy was then flourishing in great splendour, so far as capitals and uncials were
  concerned; and the coins and inscriptions of the three preceding centuries show us Roman capitals
  at their best. That rustic capitals were used in the first century is proved by the Herculanean
  remains, and that the fashion of writing in square capitals,  span class="pagenum"
  id="page26">{26}rustic capitals, and uncials was still practised in Italy down to the
  eighth century, we have sufficient grounds for knowing. But as to the style of handwriting used in
  books of which editions of perhaps a few hundred copies were issued&mdash;such, for example, as
  the edition of his own epigrams which Martial found at Lyons&mdash;we can only form conjectures.
  The semi-uncials of the fifth and sixth centuries, which grew into the minuscules of the seventh
  and eighth, must have been as much needed in the first century as the sixth, but there is no trace
  of them. The Roman cursive hand, upright or backsloped, that appears in the few extant tablets and
  wall-inscriptions of the first and second centuries, would have been too difficult for the readers
  who bought books to enjoy them, and would assuredly have served as an obstacle to their sale. It
  resembles rather the charter hand of later days than the minuscule writing of books, but the
  letters are unconnected, and there is no trace of any attempt at neatness. It is indeed almost
  illegible, without slow and painful decipherment. One striking peculiarity is the b, which
  has frequently the shape of d, a form that was retained in the official diplomatic hand of
  the fifth century. Such as it was, however, the cursive hand would have had considerable influence
  in shaping the semi-uncial or minuscule writing, which must have existed before it was adopted by
  the Irish in the fifth century and most other barbarians in the sixth. That semi-uncial, although
  we find no examples of its use in the empire before the end of the fifth century, had evidently
  been the immediate parent of the first Irish, which only differs from it in the superior evenness
  and regularity of the latter. It included the g, r, s, t, which are
  usually looked upon as special and characteristic letters of the Irish and Anglo-Saxon
  alphabet.

  After the fifth century Italy ceased to be entirely Roman. In Rome itself, and in
  the region subject to the Popes, the production of fine manuscripts of the old style in capitals
  and uncials still went on, sometimes written in gold  span class="pagenum"
  id="page27">{27}and on purple vellum; and the modified cursive hand above referred was
  applied to the writing of books as well as the writing of despatches. When this custom began is
  just what we should like to know, because it would give us the true origin of all modern minuscule
  writing or printing. A specimen, dating from the seventh century, is given in the Palæographical
  Society's facsimiles, which is clearly the type that was followed and improved upon in Central
  France, in the Caroline period. Carelessly written as it seems, it indicates that a considerable
  length of time had elapsed since the pen had been trained to form alternate light and heavy
  strokes, and to give to the curves of the letters an agreeable roundness, which was wholly missing
  in the earlier Roman cursive. It does not seem unreasonable to suppose that such writing was used
  in books long before the arrival of the fifth century; but there is no proof accessible.

  The British Isles during the Roman period

  It would have been correct enough to bracket Britain along with Spain and Gaul in a preceding
  paragraph, but we cannot venture to claim for this country any knowledge of writing before the
  arrival of the Romans. It is true that a great part of the south of the island was Gaulish, and
  that the Gauls of Gaul, who knew how to write, were in intimate relations with the Britons.
  Britania was probably a land of Celtiberian population like Spain, but without such traditions as
  the Turdetani. It was Romanised very effectively all over the south, and with the Latin language
  the people used Latin letters like their fellows in Gaul and Spain. Like other Roman citizens, the
  Britons became Christians, underwent subjugation by pagan barbarians, and lost their lives or
  their Latinity, those who escaped massacre being absorbed by the invaders. So far as writing is
  concerned, they have left nothing beyond some lapidar inscriptions; but these and whatever else
  they {28}produced in the form of MSS. during the first
  four centuries were no doubt as wholly Roman as anything of the kind in Italy.

  At so short a distance from the shores of Roman Britain, it is not likely that the Irish
  remained letterless till the fifth century of the Christian era. It is almost certain that the
  labours of St. Patrick (about the middle of that century) were but complementary to those of
  earlier missionaries; and that the adoption of the Roman alphabet in Ireland may be dated from the
  end of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century. The consummate ornamental beauty of the
  MSS. executed in Ireland during the seventh century, and the testimony given by St. Adamnan
  (writing about A.D. 670) to the expertness of St. Columba as a
  calligrapher (about 550) tend to prove that the art had been practised for a long time before it
  attained to such excellence. The particular merit of the Irish is that they seem to have developed
  (out of Roman semi-uncials) a handsome minuscule form of writing earlier than any other people.
  The cursive of the Romans had always been an ugly and ill-decipherable script; and it was only in
  the seventh century that even the Italians, under barbarian pressure, evolved a fairly good
  readable minuscule. The minuscules of Gaul and Western Germany, called Merowingian, were still in
  a formless and primitive rudeness at the time when the Irish had already attained the elegance of
  practised penmanship.

  The Goths have next to be mentioned, as they and the Irish were the only two
  barbarian nations that adopted the Græco-Roman alphabet before the break-up of the Roman
  empire.

  The Goths and Germans

  The people who in the fourth century after Christ called themselves Gut-thiuda,
  i.e. Goth-people, had been for many centuries the most easterly branch of the Germanic
  race. {29}Down at least to the second century  span
  class="smaller">B.C. their tribes occupied the regions bordering on the Vistula and the
  Dniester, extending from the Bay of Dantzig to the Black Sea. At the north-western end of the line
  they were in the time of Tacitus known as Guthones; those at the other end were called Bastarnæ by
  Polybius and Strabo, and recognised as Germans. The latter people were the first of their
  race to become acquainted with civilisation. The amber-trade was already in the time of Herodotus
  a vigorous traffic, carried on between the Baltic and the Greek settlements on the Euxine. It
  passed through the lands of the Guthones and the Bastarnæ, and led undoubtedly to the growth of
  the form of notation called Runes. The Runic alphabet, inscriptions in which are numerous in
  Scandinavia, was evidently deformed from the Greek, and must have originated about the Dniester
  some five or six centuries before Christ. As time went on, that alphabet naturally drifted further
  and further north; the Goths and Germans, nearest to the Greeks, having, of course, less need of
  it according as their knowledge increased. From the shores of the Baltic it was carried into
  Scandinavia, and became the earliest form of writing in Northern Europe. Mr. George Stephens
  claims for the oldest of the extant Norse Runes an antiquity exceeding that of our era, but a more
  moderate Scandinavian writer sets the earliest date at about A.D.
  300. In any case, it must be allowed that some form of writing was obtained by Gothic tribes from
  Greek traders before the time of Christ, and that it afterwards found a home in Denmark, Sweden,
  and Norway. The name of Runes is equivalent to that of ciphers or riddles or mysteries, and
  we may infer that its real origin was in the cutting of strokes to express numbers. Runic letters
  never reached the pen-and-ink stage of other alphabets, and their records are hardly more than
  inscriptions upon tombstones. For that and similar purposes they continued to be occasionally
  employed, both in England and Scandinavia, long after the  span class="pagenum"
  id="page30">{30}use of Roman or modified Roman letters had been established in all
  countries. The singular variations in form and number and value between runes of different dates
  and different places, are easily accounted for by the circumstance that there can have been no
  continuous practise of such inscriptions in any country in which Christianity had already
  established a simpler script.

  Runes do not seem to have come into use among the Western Germans, that is, the tribes which
  occupied the region which we now call Germany. Hrabanus Maurus, in the tenth century, wrote about
  the runes of the Marcomanni, and gave figures of them. This has led German writers to assert the
  existence of Runic letters among the Suevi in the early days of the Roman empire; but Hrabanus
  adds to "Marcomanni" the gloss "quos nos Northmannos vocamus." His Marcomanni were not the
  Marchmen of the Roman period. Bede is also said to have formulated a list of the runes of the
  Northmen. One reason which retarded the educational advancement of the Western Germans was that
  they never came into contact with the Romans till the beginning of the first century  span
  class="smaller">B.C., and even then only for a short time, in the invasion of the republic
  by the Cimbri and Teutones. They were shut away from the Roman frontiers by the buffer states of
  Celtic countries, and it was only after the conquest of Gaul, Rhætia, and Noricum that the Romans
  came into continuous conflict with Marcomanni and Suevi. It was Cæsar who first made the name of
  Germani historical, and Tacitus who invented Germania as the name of the country.

  The name Germani is, as Zeuss suggests, Gallic for "Neighbours," and was pronounced
  Gármani by the Gauls, who had first been asked by the Romans how their neighbours were
  called. It is curious that even in this country the Britons called the invading English
  Garmani, by what Bede supposed to be a corruption of speech. (The Celts in later days were
  not Latinised Britons, and knew nothing of {31}Germans.
  They made no distinction between Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, but called them all Saxons.)

  The name by which the Germans call themselves is not a race name, but merely the adjective
  meaning national, native, vernacular. Just as the Italians afterwards used the phrase in
  volgare to mean "in Italian," as distinguished from Latin, so the Germans had the word
  diutisc or thiutisc (deutsch) to mean vulgar, as opposed to walahisc or
  walesc (welsch), which meant Latin. The two adjectives became in time proper names, with
  the sense of German and Roman. The Western Germans had nothing to do with writing till they
  conquered the Welshmen of Gaul. Consequently, we proceed to the Gothic alphabet.

  After repeated attacks on the Roman empire in the third century, and repeated defeats, the
  Goths had extended their seats southwards, and were resident, in a partly Christianised state, in
  the lands north and south of the Danube. Wulfila, or Ulfila, a Goth, said to have been born in
  Cappadocia, a man of great ability, who was able to preach in Gothic, in Greek, and in Latin,
  thought the time had come to Christianise his countrymen completely. For that purpose he
  translated the Bible into the Gothic language, and created an uncial alphabet, derived partly from
  Greek, partly from Latin, and partly from Runic. Of his twenty-seven letters, two are merely
  numerals. In the twenty-five that were used for writing, the c (g), d, l,
  p, and ch have their Greek uncial shapes, the a, b, e,
  f, h, i, k, m, n, r, s, t, and
  z may be called Latin uncials; the q resembles our capital u, but is plainly
  an adaptation of the Greek koppa, the th seems to be modified from the Greek
  ph, but may have easily been the Greek th; a Roman G is inserted in the alphabet in
  the place of the Greek Ksi, and seems to have been used as gh or Y consonant;
  a Greek Y is used for the Runic angular P which represented the Teutonic w; an o with a dot
  in the centre stood for hw; and the vowels O and  span
  class="smaller">U appear as  img src="images/symbol11.png" style="width:0.6em;"
  alt="[Symbol: 8 without bottom half-loop]"/> and  img src="images/symbol12.png"
  style="width:0.5em;" alt="[Symbol: inverted U]"/>. The  span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'Gothie'">Gothic th, hw, w, o,  span
  class="pagenum" id="page32">{32}and u are found in the Runic alphabet, from which
  Ulfila must have borrowed them. So far as it was possible to him he avoided the letters of his
  pagan ancestors, but for certain sounds existing in Gothic, and not in Greek or Latin, he was
  compelled to fall back upon the Runes. Just in a similar way, the Anglo-Saxons two hundred years
  later, when adopting the Irish-Roman alphabet, were obliged to add the necessary th and
  w from the same Runic source.

  The Gothic letters of Ulfila were used for about two centuries by the so-called
  Ostrogoths, all the extant manuscripts of the Gothic Bible having been written in Italy in the
  sixth century, the famous Silver Gospels of Stockholm included. Of the Visigoths who had preceded
  the Ostrogoths in Italy, but gone onward thence to fix their rule in Southern Gaul and Spain, we
  have nothing to show that they ever made use of the Ulphilan alphabet. Their coins of the sixth
  and seventh centuries bear inscriptions in debased Roman capitals; and the so-called Visigothic
  writing in manuscripts of the eighth to the twelfth centuries is simply Spanish-Roman. The use, in
  modern times, of the word Gothic to indicate special forms of writing and architecture is very
  absurd, but the phrase has become convenient. In so far as writing is concerned, we may continue
  to use the word gothic (with a small g) to denote the angular "black letter" of the fourteenth,
  fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries.

  Irish and British writing

  Of the various species of national writing which were evolved from Roman calligraphy, and
  which, from the seventh century onwards, are divided by palæographers into Lombardic and
  Visigothic, Frankish (Merowingian), and Irish (Hibernian and Anglo-Saxon), the Irish was probably
  the first to attain a distinct type of its own. There would be  span class="pagenum"
  id="page33">{33}inherent probability in the notion that the Irish alphabet and the Irish
  style of ornament were created in Britain and transferred to Ireland in the fifth century when the
  English arrived. Professor Westwood seemed to regard the idea with favour but hesitated in giving
  it full expression. He says "it may be observed that the earliest of the sculptured Christian
  stones of Wales exhibit the same system of ornamentation, as well as the same style of
  writing, as the Irish MSS. which are, in all probability, of a somewhat more recent date." One
  will naturally seek to test the value of this observation by examining the writer's Lapidarium
  Walliæ. In that work, however, no substantiation will be found. There are a couple of instances in
  which sculptured stones bearing names, which are assigned by Bishop Stubbs to the ninth century,
  are said by Prof. Westwood to be perhaps of the sixth or seventh; and that is all. On the
  contrary, the one salient fact observable in the Lapidarium is, that all the inscriptions of the
  Roman and early post-Roman time are in pure Roman capitals, while the inscriptions upon sculptured
  stones in minuscules resembling the Irish alphabet, all belong to the period when the Angles and
  Saxons were in full possession of Irish calligraphic and artistic models&mdash;that is,
  after the seventh century. The Britons of the fifth century, at least all over the Southern
  half of the island, were a Romanised people as much as the Gauls, and it would be ridiculous to
  expect Celtic provincial art in the home of Roman culture. They were exterminated or absorbed in
  the east and middle of the island by the Germanic invaders, and they were harried out of the west
  by their Cumri kindred from the north, and by pirate Scots from Ireland. The latter part of the
  fifth century and the whole of the sixth and part of the seventh, formed a period during which the
  inhabitants of Cambria can have produced little or nothing in the way of letters or art. It was
  probably not till the beginning of the eighth century that the Cumri began to identify themselves
  with the {34}ancient Britons, and to gather up the
  legends and historical traditions of the British remnant as their own. There is a clear testimony
  that the Cumri and the Britons were closely akin as a race, but not identical, in the fact that
  names beginning with V in British use down to the fifth century are found to begin with Gu (Gw) in
  the language of the Welsh. Guend and Vend were of course two phases of an old Celtic word, but the
  former is necessarily the older. Consequently the people who have used Gw from the fifth to
  the nineteenth century cannot be the same as those who had already reached the V-stage in
  the first century. They were close relatives undoubtedly, but had little in common beyond their
  racial affinity and the original homogeneity of their speech. It may be surmised that the Briton
  found no more kindness in his Cumric stepbrother, or his Irish cousin, than in the fierce
  strangers who called him a Welshman (because they found him talking Welsh, i.e. Latin).

  Bede, in spite of his Romanist tendency, and his Romanist aversion to the practice
  of the Celtic church with regard to the Paschal festival and the tonsure, gives clear evidence
  that in the middle of the seventh century "many Englishmen of the noble and the meaner sort"
  resorted to Ireland, and dwelt there for the purpose either of study or of leading a religious
  life (divinæ lectionis vel continentioris vitæ gratiâ), and states that "the Scots received them
  all most willingly, giving them their daily food without charge, also books for reading,
  and gratuitous instruction." The Angles were apt pupils. They learned to write and ornament books
  of their own in the Irish manner, and they had Irish monks in their new monasteries who fostered
  the art. By the close of the seventh century, there were expert penmen among the Anglian monks,
  and during the eighth century, although the very close adherence to Irish models is the feature of
  most of the ornamental manuscripts, they began to strike out a new and characteristic line of
  their own in which they soon surpassed their masters. This was in  span class="pagenum"
  id="page35">{35}figure-drawing, in miniatures painted with a mastery of design which was
  altogether unknown to the Irish. The heads or figures which appeared in Irish illuminations were
  merely accessory and subordinate to the scheme of decoration, utterly contemptible as delineations
  of human form. In the Anglo-Saxon miniatures of the period which began&mdash;say about 750 and
  continued to the eleventh century, there is a distinct national school, in which the over-anxious
  treatment of draperies and the striking addiction to light green pigment, are prominent
  characteristics. The style gives a sort of general impression that it had been formed upon a
  Byzantine model, but the probability is that the later classical survival in Italy in the seventh
  century had helped to form the Anglo-Saxon taste as well as the taste of the Carolingian school. A
  similar, but ruder, expression of the same Anglo-Saxon method of illustration appeared in German
  work of the tenth and eleventh centuries; and as this had its parentage in the French Carolingian
  art of the ninth century, we may suspect that the tendency which brought that art to its
  perfection in the time of Charles the Bald, had begun in Gaul before the time of Charles the
  Great, that is, earlier than the usual date of its sudden genesis. This conjecture would make the
  production of books illustrated with miniatures synchronise in France and England, and thus
  obviate the difficulty of supposing that the Anglo-Saxons invented the art and carried it to
  perfection within a century of their learning how to write. It is sufficient glory for them to
  have converted the artistic movement of the time into a national school of painting unmistakable
  with any other, at a time when the calligraphical schools of central and Southern France, under an
  enlightened Frankish emperor, and with far superior opportunities, were labouring for a
  Gallo-Roman renaissance.

  {36}

  Origin of Mediæval Illumination

  Books in the classical period had of course been ornamented with illustrations, but the
  illumination of books (in the mediæval sense) did not originate with the Græco-Roman calligraphers
  of the Empire. We cannot suppose that it sprang into life in Ireland, but certainly its first
  European manifestation was in Irish MSS., and the art had not been received by the Irish from any
  of the European nations. The only alternative is, however, far fetched, that Christian
  missionaries from the East (or with Eastern training) had preceded St. Patrick and brought with
  them those characteristics of Syro-Egyptian art which are traceable alike in Irish and in
  Byzantine work. The documentary period of writing in Ireland is of course later than the actual
  practice of the art in that country, but it is earlier than amongst any other of the unromanised
  barbarians. Adamnan, writing about A.D. 670, relates the life of St.
  Columba (dead in 598) and describes the writing materials which that saint had used in his
  scriptorium in the island of Hy. As he had learned to write in Ireland and had begun his priestly
  career there before 540, we may place the historically ascertainable use of writing in Ireland as
  beginning with the early years of the sixth century. Irish monks carried the art to Britain, to
  Gaul, to Germany; and those elaborate and intricate patterns to which the French give the names of
  "lettres perlées, lettres brodées, spirales, n&#x0153;uds, et entrelacs, initiales
  ophiomorphiques, ichthyomorphiques," &amp;c., and which they claim as indigenous productions of
  Carolingian France in the early part of the ninth century&mdash;were fruits of the teaching of
  Irish missionaries, in the houses which they founded in Britain and all over the continent in the
  seventh century.

  Some of the remarks in the preceding section will be found in strong disagreement with the
  authority of Professor {37}Westwood, whose work on the
  Anglo-Saxon and Irish miniatures is such a splendid testimony to his zeal and ability. His
  conjectural dates are, however, frequently misleading. An instance is that of the so-called Bible
  of St. Gregory, figured on his plates 14, 15. In the
  text he says that Sir Frederick Madden had declared the MS. to be "unquestionably of the eighth
  century," but he prefers to call it of the seventh, in agreement with Casley and Astle (who
  thought so in the last century!). He ought to have accepted the opinion of a recognised master in
  palæography like Sir Frederick, so far as the writing is concerned, in preference to that of two
  men living at a time before the science had attained anything like exactness in England. He ought
  also to have seen or felt, while making his elaborate facsimile, that the nearest parallel to the
  style of illumination of his "first page of Luke" is to be found in Carolingian work executed
  about 800; and that no great space of time could separate the two examples. The English work was
  probably the earlier, but it can hardly have been accomplished before 770. The purely Irish
  patterns in the columns supporting the arch, with the excellent picture of St. Luke that surmounts
  it, prove by their combination that the work is Anglo-Saxon of its second and finer period, that
  is after the phase in which it was merely and wholly imitative of the Irish. With these
  considerations in view, and a remembrance of Bede's words quoted above in relation to Anglian
  education in Ireland about A.D. 650, the assignment of the Bible of
  St. Gregory to the seventh century is a pure absurdity.&mdash;Again, Westwood's facsimile from the
  Golden Gospels of Stockholm, bears the attribution "Sixth Century? Ninth Century?" while its
  position in the book, as the first plate, tends to show that Professor Westwood leaned to the
  earlier date. Yet the book is unquestionably not Irish; its artistic illustration is a singularly
  fine development of Anglo-Saxon art&mdash;think of Anglo-Saxon art and chrysography in the sixth
  century! The writing cannot be {38}mistaken for Roman
  uncials of the sixth century; it is plainly in Carolingian uncials of the latter half of the
  eighth. The book seems to have been illustrated by an Anglian hand, and written by a Frankish
  one,&mdash;probably on the continent rather than in England.

  Books in Irish or Saxon-Irish writing are found all over the continent. As they were written in
  monasteries founded by Irish missionaries during the seventh and eighth centuries, they only
  indicate that a succession of Irish or of Saxon monks continued to make their way for a
  considerable period to France, Germany, and Italy. The writing can hardly be said to have left any
  traces in the various national hands of those countries, but the Irish house at Bobbio probably
  transmitted the use of the interlaced ornamentation which revived in Italy several centuries
  later.

  Most of the motifs of decoration in the illuminated Carolingian, Visigothic, and
  Lombardic MS. were derived from the Irish methods of ornamentation introduced through monastic
  houses and schools established by Irish monks on the continent. French writers deny their
  indebtedness to foreigners for it, since, as they say, the pattern was always at hand in the
  tessellated and mosaic pavements of Gallo-Roman architecture. But there is something of
  unnecessary vanity in the denial. The Irish MSS. of the seventh century are the first in Europe
  which contain decorative initials of the kind. This fact is indisputable, and is not affected by
  the question of original derivation, which in my opinion is to be sought for in the east among
  those Hellenised Syrians and Egyptians who were the propagators of Christian art as well as
  Christian religion in the west.

  Merowingian, Lombardic, Visigothic

  These names, applied to varying styles of writing, are without historical exactness. Roughly
  speaking, the first {39}means the debased Roman used in
  Gaul and Western Germany from the sixth to the eighth century, the second was the script of the
  larger part of Italy (but chiefly the east and the south) between the ninth and the twelfth
  centuries, the third was the national hand of Spain and Languedoc during the eighth to the twelfth
  century. The names are based upon erroneous historical assumptions. The Frankish kings, supposed
  to be descended from Merowig, carried with them across the Rhine no graphic system whatever. They
  found in Gaul the identical styles of writing which were used in Italy, and such of their people
  as gave up the trade of warriors to assume that of clerics and councillors, were obliged to learn
  the arts of the Gauls. The circumstances under which the new kingdom was established as a
  permanent institution, were not such as to make the Franks a nation of penmen; and the influence
  of their bad taste in calligraphy could hardly have been felt till the beginning of the seventh
  century. Their Gallic underlings continued to write as before, but in the absence of enlightened
  patronage, the schools of art no longer produced good work, except in the monasteries of the
  Provincia Romana, where less deterioration took place than elsewhere. The Frankish monarchy was so
  widely extended throughout the territories stretching from the Loire to the Main, and along the
  whole course of the Rhine from south to north, even in "Merovingian" times, that the use of the
  word to designate a special style of writing is hardly desirable. It is probable enough that in
  the seventh century and the early part of the eighth a kind of uniformity existed in the writing
  used in all the region between Paris and Mentz, but it was nothing else than Roman uncials,
  semiuncials, and minuscules written in more or less cramped and graceless fashion; varying only in
  the degree of badness according to the locality. It is Roman cacography with a Germanic stamp upon
  it. There was a decided improvement in it when the eighth century was in progress.

  {40}

  The Lombardic hand is also a Roman hand as written by or for barbarians who lived nearer to the
  centre of civilisation than the Franks did. To justify its name it would be necessary to show that
  it originated and was practised in the region we call Lombardy in the seventh century. There is,
  however, no trace of its existence before the ninth century, and very little show of its having
  been used to any extent in Cisalpine Gaul. Most of the surviving examples of its employment as a
  national or local script indicate Eastern and Southern Italy as its home during the ninth to the
  twelfth century; while most of the manuscripts produced in Lombardy and northern Italy during that
  time belong rather to the Carolingian type. In fact, the Carolingian minuscule, the Visigothic
  minuscule, and the Lombardic minuscule all show at their beginning so much similarity that we look
  for examples of the latter two sufficiently early to decide a doubt which arises&mdash;which of
  the three was the fountain head of modern letters. The chief marks of distinction in the Lombardic
  through its whole career are the t shaped nearly like a, and the a shaped
  like cc. The Visigothic t is identical with the Lombardic; and in the a there
  is so little unlikeness that the form of the letter seems to be something halfway between u
  and cc. (It is equivalent to cc without their beaks or initial knobs.) The
  circumstance that two scripts so widely removed in place should retain common peculiarities, down
  to the very end of their severed existence, leads to a suspicion that the so-called Lombardic was
  probably a post-Ulfilan Ostrogothic. The peculiarities referred to, and some others which need not
  be specialised, are also found in the "Merowing" writing of books produced west of the Rhine in
  the seventh century. Now as Carolingian writing is quite free from these peculiarities, we can
  safely conclude that the Lombardic and the Visigothic are both older than the time of Charles the
  Great. It is usually supposed by those who see the difficulty attaching to the use of the name
  Lombardic, that the mode {41}of writing so styled was
  used in the kingdom of the Longbeards, but died out in its chief home after the conquest by the
  Franks, and only maintained a continued existence in the Neapolitan duchies held by princes of
  Lombardic origin. The suspicion hinted at above becomes stronger when we review these facts. The
  Lombards were a far rougher and more uncultivated race than the Goths, and found a Gothic-Roman
  script in use in Italy when they entered to destroy the kingdom of Theodoric. It was probably in
  Ravenna that the so-called Lombardic minuscule had its seat during the sixth century, side by side
  with the declining Gothic uncial of Wulfila. From Ravenna, its spread over the east and south of
  Italy would be much more easily effected than from Milan or Pavia; and its undeniable similarity
  to the Visigothic script of Spain leads to the belief that these two were the real Gothic writing
  of the early Middle Ages, as distinguished from the M&#x0153;sian alphabet, which cannot have
  endured much longer than the reign of Theodoric himself. The hand which is called broken Lombard
  belongs to a later time. Its characteristic is an attempt to produce an ornamental wavy effect by
  suspending the weight of the pen-stroke in the middle of each descent, but the forms of the
  letters remain unchanged. It was a fashion of Neapolitan writing in the eleventh and twelfth
  centuries, and seems to correspond in its own school with that tendency in the schools of northern
  countries which produced the angular "gothic" of the thirteenth. As has been remarked in another
  paragraph, the "Lombardic" flourished even in Italy, side by side with the pure Carolingian, which
  had become the most favoured of all handwritings since the Empire of the West was renewed in the
  family of Charles the Great. The Carolingian, however, seems to have encroached to no more
  southerly point than Rome itself, leaving all the region beyond to its Lombardic rival.

  Of the Visigothic, as of the Lombardic, it has to be said that, so far as extant specimens are
  concerned, it might {42}well have been the offspring of
  the Carolingian, rather than an elder form of writing. Its kinship, however, to "Merowingian" and
  "Lombardic" is undeniable, and there is a very fair show of probability that the Visigoths had
  something to do with it, notwithstanding the fact that we only know it in examples later than the
  destruction of the Gothic monarchy in Spain. What the term Visigothic means we do not know. Most
  people think it meant West Gothic, and that is how it was interpreted by Jornandes, who, as an
  Italian Ostrogoth of the sixth century, ought to have been capable of understanding the sense of
  the word. It is, however, very uncertain; for Jornandes, though intelligent and well-informed, was
  not impeccable even as regards his Gothic kinsmen. Most of his knowledge was derived from his
  Latin education, and to him probably we owe a good many misconceptions, arising from his
  acceptance of various geographical names in Latin and Greek writers as referring to his own people
  and their kindred. Nothing which he has said has had a more enduring influence upon opinion than
  the statement that Scandinavia, the "vagina gentium," had bred all the barbaric tribes which
  overpowered the Roman empire. Of course, he knew nothing of Scandinavia beyond the vague facts
  that Goths, Heruli, Burgundians, Lombards, and Cimbri inhabited the southern shores of the Baltic,
  and that there was a vast land beyond that sea. Everything that descended from the north seemed to
  have come down from Scania, or Scandinavia. He did not know, as we do, that the climate of
  Scandinavia must have been at that time much more severe than now, and that the population of
  Norway, Sweden, and Denmark cannot have reached in the fourth and fifth centuries to anything like
  its present numbers. The movements of that age, which carried millions of warriors to Greece,
  Italy, France, Spain, and Africa, represented a wave of emigration, caused by an overflow of
  population, beginning in the far East, on the confines of China, of which the typical originators,
  so far as {43}Europe is concerned, were the Huns. No such
  overflow was possible from Scandinavia.

  The Visigothic script had certainly not yet come into existence when the kingdom of
  Alaric had its capital at Toulouse in the fifth century. After the Franks had driven the Goths
  southward, and the monarchy was established in Spain (incorporating the Suabians, who had held a
  separate state in Portugal), we may suppose that the Visigothic hand was derived from that of the
  Ostrogoths, and used in the service of the Gothic monarchs until their dynasty was destroyed by
  the Saracenic conquest in 713. From that time onwards to the twelfth century it was employed in
  all the Christian lands of Spain, although, as in Italy, the Carolingian script began to be
  introduced in the ninth century. The two kinds of writing went on side by side, the Carolingian
  always gaining ground as time went on, until in the thirteenth century Spain fell into line with
  the other countries of Europe in adopting a sort of French "angular gothic."

  The Carolingian Renewal

  The renewal of art and learning in Gaul in the second half of the eighth century is ascribed to
  the patronage of Karl the Great and his descendants. He was a man of extraordinary gifts, and few
  figures of equal majesty have ever appeared on the stage of history. King of the Franks and the
  Lombards, Roman Emperor of the West, a great conqueror, a wise statesman, and a man of learning,
  he has left his name even in the annals of palæography. It can hardly have been in the beautiful
  Roman handwriting which is called after him that he transcribed the Frankish ballads or set down
  the rules of Frankish grammar, as he is said to have done. He was fond of practising with his pen,
  but, as Eginhart says, the study was begun too late in life to be cultivated with success. He had
  excellent taste, however, {44}and bestowed generous
  rewards upon the calligraphers who worked for him. His usual home was at Aachen, and his palace
  there contained a library and a scriptorium, in which scribes were always busy. A greater school
  of calligraphy was in the Abbey of St. Martin at Tours, directed by the famous Alcuin, under the
  Emperor's patronage. It was at Tours, undoubtedly, that the Carolingian writing reached the stage
  at which it became the model for all succeeding time, and Alcuin was almost certainly the man who
  introduced the Irish-Saxon fashion of decorative ornament, as practised in York when he resided
  there with Archbishop Egbert. A great deal of the learning which (with some latitude of
  phraseology) has been attributed above to the Emperor, was due to the frequent lectures upon all
  branches of science which Alcuin was in the habit of delivering when he and his patron were
  together&mdash;usually at Aachen. Karl did not spend much of his leisure time in the France which
  regards him as her own prince. He is believed to have founded the University of Paris, but he did
  not regard the city on the Seine as equal to Rome or Arles. It was not included in the twenty-one
  metropolitan cities of his empire.

  Wherever the movement arose which produced the beauty of Carolingian work, we can have no
  difficulty in declaring it to have been in central or Southern France, not in the Rhenish
  territories. That contemporary calligraphers would have followed the lead was to be expected,
  whether they worked at Aachen or at Metz, or at Trier or elsewhere; but the real perfection of the
  style must have been attained in those parts of France which were most nearly connected with
  Provence. The uncials of Carolingian work were imitated from Roman work of the fifth century, the
  capitals from Roman inscriptions of the empire, and the minuscules were improved from the two
  contemporary Italian scripts in which they were found, that is the Papal Roman and the
  Gotho-Lombard. The art was cultivated (and we may allow that it had been so cultivated for many
  years before Alcuin's {45}arrival) so carefully that a
  fine æsthetic sense had arisen, and every letter of all three kinds was drawn with an elegant
  simplicity and truth which the world has never ceased to admire. The letters are upright and
  wholly without angularities, and are quite free from the mannerisms by which in the two Gothic
  hands of the time certain unessential portions of the outline were dwelt upon and made
  over-prominent, to the deterioration of the graphic form. Fine as the writing is in the time of
  the great Emperor, it is still finer throughout the half century or so which followed his death,
  in all the Gallic centres.

  At the same time, the decoration of manuscripts, otherwise remarkable for their calligraphical
  excellence, with illuminated initials, border ornamentation, and miniatures resembling in
  character those of the Anglo-Saxon school but infused to a greater degree with the feeling and the
  style of late classical art, render the Carolingian French school of the ninth century one of the
  most splendid in the history of palæography.

  The scripts of Spain and Italy lived on for centuries uncorrected in certain
  peculiarities by the example of Carolingian writing, but gradually drawing nearer, and visibly
  improved in manner. This was brought about by the introduction into both countries of pure
  Carolingian work, practised simultaneously with the native styles, and constantly increasing in
  influence. In England the Carolingian type won but little ground, notwithstanding the Romanising
  tendencies of Winchester and Canterbury and the Southern monasteries in general. It was not till
  the tenth century that certain signs of Carolingian influence are seen in the writing of Latin
  charters, and it was only in the twelfth century that the handwriting of Northern France and of
  England began to take an identical character. In Germany, of course, Carolingian writing was an
  inheritance, but it was never cultivated with the same elegance as in France. The letters began
  gradually to slope and grow {46}narrow, and to take small
  projections at the extremities which by and bye became medieval gothic forms.

  A Review at the standpoint of the Ninth Century

  The middle ages began with the establishment of barbarian monarchies over the area
  of the Roman empire of the west; and with the middle ages began the final and the most important
  chapter in the history of manuscripts. The study of manuscripts, for most persons, is confined to
  the period between the twelfth century and the sixteenth; since it is not given to everyone to
  make pilgrimages to the museums scattered over Europe, for the purpose of looking at the earlier
  and rarer examples of writing. Besides, the chief interest of the study lies rather in the
  decoration than the calligraphy of manuscripts; and it was not till the fourteenth century that
  the production of such work became so large and general as to leave a sufficient number of
  specimens readily accessible to modern inspection. The history of illuminated manuscripts begins
  in Ireland in the sixth century, that first phase being the application to written books of a
  system of Oriental decorative ornament which had previously been confined to architectural work.
  It spread into England in the seventh century, a little later into Gaul and Germany, and a new
  phase began in the eighth century by a happy combination of Romanesque pictorial design with the
  more purely decorative features of barbaric art. In the ninth century England and central France
  were easily ahead of all the other barbarian states. In Germany, in Aquitaine, in Spain, and in
  Northern Italy, the same system was followed, but with a prevailing stamp of barbarism, especially
  in the design of the human figure, which affords a striking contrast to the refined luxury of
  Carolingian art and the more sober splendour of English work. The only parallel was in Byzantium
  and Alexandria, where a similar combination had led to a nearly similar  span class="pagenum"
  id="page47">{47}effect, with this difference however, that the decorative illumination was
  a far less prominent feature than the pictorial designs. Roman Italy and Roman Provence still kept
  aloof from the new movement. The classical traditions which survived there permitted the
  production of MSS. written in gold, and perhaps also illustrated with pictures, such as had
  constituted the splendour of books in the first five centuries; but the immixture of decorative
  patterns from architectural design, which formed the art of illumination, was a thing of
  alien character to the taste of the older school. Examples of course were produced both in Rome
  itself and in Provence of the new mode of illumination, but they are to be ascribed to the
  barbarian element which was encroaching there as elsewhere, and which finally triumphed.

  Byzantine Work

  The traditions of classical art, which had begun to grow weaker in Byzantium even before the
  seventh century, had faded away when the Eastern Emperor lost all hold upon Italy. Not Athens, nor
  Rome, but Memphis, seemed to inspire the later æstheticism of Byzantine art; and the Greek
  emperors, from the ninth century onwards, appeared to be the successors rather of a line of
  Ptolemies than of Cæsars. When we contrast the sculptures of ancient Greece, the designs upon
  Græco-Roman coins, and the pictures in Pompeii, with the work of Byzantine illuminators, we are
  inevitably reminded that the word Greek is rarely appropriate in connexion with MSS. There is very
  little of true Greek in the artistic features of Thraco-Græcian or Ægypto-Græcian work; and it is
  not to real Greeks or to real Romans that we owe the handsome Roman and the handsome Hellenic type
  in which the texts of the ancient classics are now printed.

  In the minuscule writing of Greek, which is usually  span class="pagenum"
  id="page48">{48}supposed to have come into use about the end of the eighth century, there
  never was the same calligraphical character as the uncials of an earlier time had exhibited, nor
  the same desire to attain symmetrical beauty as was shown over and over again in the manuscripts
  of Western Europe. The best writing of Greek minuscules belongs to the ninth and tenth centuries
  of our era, in which a sufficient amount of practice had been gained to ensure regularity of form.
  A specimen of such writing, executed towards the end of the tenth century, probably in Cyprus,
  will be found in Plate 6. From the eleventh century to the sixteenth all
  minuscule writing in Greek looks like a free cursive written without any calligraphical ambition,
  and it became more and more ungraceful as time went on. The value of Greek MSS., however, depends
  more upon their contents than upon their beauty, and frequently the roughest-looking piece of work
  may command an interest far greater than attaches to the splendid penmanship of the west.

  The recently discovered "Gospel of Peter" is in a curious primitive minuscule hand,
  which the editor of the facsimile, Oscar von Gebhardt, ascribes hesitatingly to the eighth or
  ninth century, as had already been done by H. Omont. It would not be surprising if other scholars
  were to assign it to the seventh century, and thereby throw back the age of Greek minuscule
  writing to a century or more behind the date usually fixed for it. The mingling in that curious
  Christian document of many uncial forms, with a set of minuscular letters that betray a want of
  familiarity with set minuscules, seems to prove that the book is older than the eighth century.
  This observation is made, not from any desire to be critical, but simply in order to show that the
  question of age, mentioned in the preceding paragraph, is a thing which is still not finally
  settled.

  {49}

  The Tenth Century

  The Irish school of writing, after its triumphs of the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries,
  lost much of its home-life in the midst of the struggles with the Norsemen. In England and on the
  continent its influence was still felt for some time longer; even in the thirteenth century many
  of the Psalters produced by English illuminators have the initial letter B decorated in the style
  adopted from the Irish six centuries before. Irish MSS. of any age are excessively rare; even the
  comparatively worthless transcripts of the eighteenth century are in no inconsiderable
  request.

  The English school continued to blend its Irish style of writing with the illustrative pictures
  and borders which may have been entirely of native production in the eighth century, as was
  seemingly the fact, or may have originated from the artistic tendencies of Frankish Gaul, as has
  already been surmised. They were, in any case, influenced to some degree by examples of late Roman
  work, introduced by the Italian missionaries who came to convert the Saxons of South England after
  the Angles of the north had been converted by the Irish monks of Iona. It was really this English
  phase of decorative art which blossomed into Anglo-Norman in the twelfth century.

  The French schools were still Carolingian and splendid, but their pre-eminence was
  not maintained after the breaking up of the empire of Charles the Great. The revolutions of the
  ninth century led to the making of nations. France ceased to be the Gallo-Roman province of a
  Frankish monarchy. A French language and a French nation emerged into existence in the tenth
  century, but the grand ornamental and calligraphic work of the Franco-Gallic time was no longer
  equalled. The Caroline writing, which attained its greatest beauty about the middle of the  span
  class="pagenum" id="page50">{50}ninth century, gradually lost its elegant boldness, tending
  towards angularity and crampness when the eleventh century had begun.

  Scandinavian Writing

  The Scandinavian countries have not yet been alluded to specifically. The immense quantity of
  Runic monuments found in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, of all ages, and in England, of and after
  the Norse period, proves that Runic writing was almost exclusively Scandinavian. There is now no
  question as to the actual origin of the Runic alphabets. They came into existence, as already
  said, by reason of the necessities of the amber-traffic between the coast of the Baltic and the
  Crimea long before the time of Christ; but what has survived belongs to the monuments of the
  North. The real age of the extant runes does not probably exceed the fifth century. That they were
  prized as national characteristics seems to be proved by their continued use among the Northmen,
  even after they had come into collision with a superior civilisation in the British isles.

  Christianity was not so easily adopted in Scandinavia as in some other countries. From the time
  of the first mission to its ultimate triumph at least two centuries elapsed, and the result might
  have been still further delayed if it had not been for the example of two royal proselytes, Olaf
  Trygvason and St. Olaf, who belong to the first half of the eleventh century. With the first
  introduction of Christianity, the Norse people also received the script which they had found in
  use in England. The colonisers of Iceland, in the ninth and tenth centuries, carried with them the
  language and the writing of Scandinavia; and it was probably the remoteness of that island from
  Norway which has caused the preservation in it, down to the present  span class="pagenum"
  id="page51">{51}day, of the old Norse tongue (little modified by age) and the Anglo-Saxon
  letters of the tenth century.

  In Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, the influence of North Germany prevailed in time
  over old national tradition, and the gothic hand of the thirteenth century took the place of the
  special alphabet. By the time of the Reformation the writing in Scandinavia had been wholly
  Teutonised (with some exceptions too slight to need mention). The most remarkable part of the
  change was the exclusion of the th letter from the script of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.
  This tendency, which had for centuries been in growth, had the remarkable effect of practically
  confining the old Norse literature to Iceland, and of making it the apparent home of all the poems
  and Sagas which Norway had produced. It was at least the home of most of the literary men who in
  the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries wrote for the delight of their kinsmen, in both
  Norway and Iceland. The great literary activity in Iceland, at that time and afterwards, produced
  a large quantity of MSS., usually written on vellum, and rudely decorated with painted initials;
  but of those which remained in the country most have perished. A relatively considerable number
  were, however, carried to Denmark in the sixteenth and later centuries, and have been preserved in
  museums. Very few yet remain in circulation, unsecured by public appropriation.

  The Slavonic Alphabet

  Slavonic writing is said to have begun with St. Jerome. To him is ascribed the
  invention of the Glagolitic alphabet, a set of symbols for Illyrian use, which seem to have no
  affinity to any of the familiar scripts. It cannot have obtained much currency, notwithstanding
  the ample sufficiency of its twenty-eight letters; as otherwise the Cyrillic alphabet (derived
  from the Greek, with necessary {52}additions) would never
  have come into being. In any case, St. Cyril's alphabet, devised in the ninth century for the use
  of the Slovenes in Moravia, quite overpowered the Glagolitic of Dalmatia, and while the Croats and
  the Dalmatians, who came under the influence of the Roman see, retained their Glagolitic only for
  liturgical use, the Slavs to the east fell into communion with the Greek Church, and employed the
  Cyrillic letters as their national type of writing. It has lasted to the present time in its old
  form, in biblical and liturgical books of which the texts are ancient, but a plainer type, more
  like the Greek of to-day, has been adopted for modern literature. The Poles and Bohemians, and the
  various Slavs in Germany, have always followed the custom of Germany in writing. The Russian
  alphabet is more complex than that of Servia; but it is only in modern time that the latter has
  been simplified. The Bulgarians, since the establishment of their autonomy, have given up the old
  Slovene alphabet, and adopted that of Servia.

  The Labour of Mediæval Scribes from the Ninth Century onwards

  The literature which was to afford material for the exercise of the penmen's skill was
  restricted within Christian boundaries. It was rarely that a scribe condescended to make copies of
  any of the literary work produced in pagan Rome or Greece. Occasional instances are found which
  offer exception to the rule, but as in the ninth century all the men who knew how to write were,
  in one form or another, servants of the Church, it was not to be expected that many among them
  would help to perpetuate the pernicious books of the dead heathens. Consequently many of the
  treasures of ancient literature perished. The Bible was the substitute; and innumerable copies
  were made in the East and the West of the book which has influenced the world more powerfully
  {53}than any other production of the wit of man. In the
  East, there was a more logical tendency to neglect the Old Testament and to copy only the New; in
  the West, it was the custom to multiply transcripts of the complete Latin Scripture as left by St.
  Jerome. Besides the Bible, there were the liturgical monuments. The Sacramentary which contained
  the order of sacrifice and adoration in the most solemn office of the Church, with all the prayers
  that preceded and followed the acts of offering and worship, required careful and frequent
  copying, so that it should not deviate in the smallest degree from the established model. The
  slight changes which constituted differences of use in this part of the liturgy, and which have
  distinguished the so-called Gallican, Mozarabic, Milanese, and Celtic churches as at least co-æval
  with (and possibly older than) the Latin church of Rome, began to lose their historic distinctness
  in the ninth century and soon faded away. The survival of belated and rare examples (by the grace
  of papal sanction) at Toledo and at Milan, is but an antiquarian curiosity without any
  significance. Rome triumphed in the ninth century, and the diversities in certain respects which
  have been dignified in England and elsewhere with the name of "use" since then, are simply local
  varieties in unimportant particulars.

  Beyond the establishment of the supreme rite of sacrifice on certain holy days, the Church
  began, at an early period of its existence, to treat every day as consisting of so many hours of
  which some were necessarily to be yielded up to religious service. The use of the Psalms, and of
  set prayers, for that purpose, and the fact that the anniversaries of saints' and martyrs' deaths
  had to be borne in remembrance, led to the creation of the Breviary. Besides this, the office of
  the Mass itself became requisite for celebration on every day as well as on the more solemn days,
  and thus a variable portion (according to the character of the day) had to be added to the
  invariable. Thus enlarged, the volume of the  span class="pagenum"
  id="page54">{54}Sacramentary, with all its lessons from the Bible, and its accumulations of
  antiphonal phrases, grew into the Missal as we know it. The Breviary underwent similar increase,
  and the result was to make the Liturgy so extensive and so complex that it gave continual
  employment in the scriptorium of every church and monastery all over Europe. There were Psalters,
  Sacramentaries, Missals, Breviaries, Lectionaries of several kinds, Hymnals, Graduals (Books of
  the chanted antiphonal portions of the Mass), Antiphonaries (Books of the chanted antiphonal
  portions of the Hours-offices), Martyrologies, Homilies, and (at a later time) Rituals,
  Processionals, and Pontificals (offices to be performed by Bishops). St. Gregory had been the
  latest official arranger of the Sacramentary or Missal, in the seventh century; but its text was
  hardly settled till the twelfth century, and the same may be said of the Breviary. In the ninth
  century, however, the texts had grown to something not very different from their ultimate state.
  Here was plenty of work for the priestly and monkish scribes.

  Besides the Bible and the Liturgy, there were the works of the fathers, and by-and-by the
  treatises of the schoolmen and the chronicles of monkish historians; quite enough, in all
  conscience, to render useless the heavy lucubrations of Livy and Trogus Pompeius, and the absurd
  conceits of the heathen poets.

  Things were not dissimilar in Byzantium. The Liturgy there was even more complex and extensive
  than in the West, and the foolish literature of old Hellas was generally ignored by the men who
  were engaged in daily study of the Euchologium, the Horologium, the Menologium, the Archieraticon,
  the Synaxarium, the Octoechos, &amp;c. The Bibliotheca of Photius shows, however, that the race of
  students who cultivated the old literature was not wholly extinct.

  At all times, both in the East and the West, the letters and charters of Kings, and diplomatic
  documents of every {55}kind, needed the service of
  trained penmen. This department of graphic labour was not completely in the hands of churchmen;
  and it led to the creation of a caste of writers in every country who were not under the influence
  of the monkish schools. They could not afford to spend so much time as the book writers over their
  work, and thus a hand of cursive character was established in every chancellery in Europe, devoted
  only to the service of the State and never employed for any other purpose. It was nearly always
  ugly, sometimes fantastic, sometimes difficult to be read except by the officials engaged in such
  work. From the earliest days of diplomatic writing, in the sixth century in Italy, down to the
  seventeenth century in England, it preserved a strange and fanciful style, first long, thin and
  narrow letters looking like a congeries of wandering parallel lines indistinguishable without a
  glass, and finally letters of proper size, but so disguised in shape as to be indecipherable
  without a special training. At only one period, that is, in the late eleventh and in the twelfth
  century, was diplomatic writing fair and readable. That was in England and Northern France; but
  even here, the upright strokes of letters like l, and d, and b, were elongated to an enormous
  extent, and in their sweep offered to the scribe his few opportunities of ornamentation. As our
  business, however, is with books we leave the charters and the rescripts on one side, and proceed
  to the consideration of the main character of the calligrapher's work.

  The Bible and the Liturgy for churchmen have been spoken of as the chief objects of
  reproduction among the scribes for many centuries. It was not till the twelfth century that their
  labours required to be augmented for the service of laymen. Men (and women) who could afford the
  expense, or whose position demanded that they should have prayerbooks for their own use, whether
  they could read ill or well or not at all, were furnished with Latin Psalters, to which were
  added, at the end, the Athanasian {56}Creed, a Litany of
  Saints, some general prayers, and the office for the Dead. They were extracts from the Breviary
  for the use of persons who only prayed occasionally. The growth of something like education, and a
  religious desire to share to a somewhat greater extent the communion with Heaven which was
  monopolised by monks and priests, caused a further extension of calligraphic labour towards the
  beginning of the fourteenth century. The Psalter with its scanty additions was no longer
  sufficient for pious laymen. A larger selection of prayers and lessons from the Breviary was
  concocted; the offices of the Virgin, of the Cross, of the Holy Ghost, and of some special saints
  were united to form the Book of Hours. It was nothing like the severe and frequent task of orisons
  with which the monks performed their duties at the canonical Hours of the day and night, but it
  was sufficient for the most zealous laymen and laywomen; and it became the private Prayerbook of
  the fourteenth, fifteenth, and early sixteenth centuries. During that period it was produced in
  countless thousands of manuscripts in England, France, Flanders, Italy, and to a less extent in
  Germany and Spain. In England it was called Horæ Beatæ Mariæ Virginis, or Book of Hours, or
  Primer; in France always Horæ, or Livre d'Heures; in Italy it was Officium B.V.M., and in Flanders
  and Holland Ghetijden. The Gebetbuch of Germany belongs chiefly to the fifteenth century, and was
  nearly always in German, while in France, Flanders, and England, prayers in the vernacular only
  crept in gradually here and there. (In Italy the book always continued to be written in Latin
  only.) In the English Hours or Primer the vernacular portions became at last so important that it
  was found advisable to issue many of the printed Primers in the sixteenth century in bilingual
  form, Latin and English; and it was undoubtedly this tendency both in England and in Germany which
  produced the Reformation. It was not so much the desire for a Reformation of the Church&mdash;even
  Boccaccio, himself a churchman, {57}and many others of
  his kind had wished for that&mdash;as an invincible demand for a vernacular liturgy, which
  widened through opposition into an eagerness to sweep away everything that opposed it. Hence the
  break with Rome, which still imperiously demanded the uniformity that could only be maintained by
  the use of a single language throughout Europe. The few exceptions to the rule which
  ecclesiastical policy had ever allowed were in the concession to the affiliated Greek, Slavonic,
  and Oriental congregations of a right to use their own vernacular liturgies. The antiquity of the
  Greek and Syriac formulas, on the one hand, the utter impossibility of making Latin familiar even
  to the priests of the Slavic and Oriental churches, and the certainty that a denial of their needs
  would throw them into the Byzantine fold&mdash;account for Papal acquiescence in that respect. But
  the Popes could not see that England and Germany, which had from so early a time been the seats of
  Roman colonies and the homes of Latin churches, likewise needed a liturgy that the people could
  understand; and that the Teutonic speech of the north had no such generic sympathy with the
  language of the Roman liturgy as the rustic Latin tongues of Italy, Spain, and France.

  The Canon Law, deriving from the remains of the apostolical constitutions and the acts of the
  Councils, the Penitentiaries which had been formulated by bishops for the government of
  Christianised barbarians, and the decrees of Popes, began to take shape as a Code in the eleventh
  and twelfth centuries. The existence of forged documents among the decretals was a matter of no
  great importance. Everything was sufficiently old to be respectable; and the schools of law, which
  had never given up the study and cultivation of the Civil Code (digested in Justinian's time from
  the various works of the old Roman jurists), set to work to arrange and gloss the Canon Law. The
  two Codes, especially the Ecclesiastical, provided the scribes of Western Europe with an enormous
  amount of work. Bologna, {58}Padua, Paris, and Oxford
  were renowned for their lawyers and their schools of law; with the accompanying armies of students
  and copyists.

  Christian poets, too, were not lacking. From the time of Lactantius onwards, the
  quantity of metrical Latin work done by churchmen was very large; and the lyrical yearning
  inherent in all societies had produced an immense hymnology, which comprised a great deal of real
  poetry&mdash;most poetical and most charming when least Ciceronian. Here, again, was rich material
  for the copyists of the scriptorium; and both Hymnals and Lawbooks lent their aid towards the
  gradual tendency of students to go back and investigate the ancient sources of literature and
  philosophy and history. Pliny had never been wholly forgotten, even in the most anti-pagan times,
  and the treatises on natural science which had appeared among the schoolmen, all stimulated
  curiosity to learn what had been written before the days of Constantine. The result of these
  intellectual tendencies made the fourteenth century a dawn of the Renaissance, and with the
  beginning of the fifteenth a large body of heathen literature was annexed to the libraries of
  universities, scholars, and monasteries, giving increased employment to the transcribers who were
  at that time busy all over Europe. It was in the thirteenth century that the monks and the priests
  lost their monopoly of the practice of ornamental writing; in the fourteenth century every great
  city had its ateliers of calligraphers unconnected with the Church; and when the fifteenth century
  arrived the trained citizen penmen, who formed crafts throughout Europe, were probably not
  inferior in number to the scribes who worked in ecclesiastical edifices.

  The Illuminated MSS. of the Middle Ages

  This division of our matter is the largest, and is also the most interesting to the majority of
  students and {59}collectors. In beginning it, some
  repetition will be necessary in order to bring the subject as a whole before the reader.

  Between the ninth century and the sixteenth, the multiplication of MSS. in Europe was very
  great, but comparatively few of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh have been preserved. Beautiful
  examples of blended writing and decoration were produced in England in the ninth century by
  Anglian and Irish calligraphers in the north, and by Saxon writers in the south. In York and
  Durham, and Lindisfarne, the style and the motifs of ornament were still thoroughly Irish; in the
  south, although the late Roman had conquered the Celtic, their collision had produced a singularly
  fine type of illumination, reminiscent of Byzantine work, but much more free and natural. That art
  had already beautified the Carolingian French school; in the Carolingian German its influence
  appears in a weaker and ruder form. When with the tenth century France and Germany emerged as two
  distinct nations from the chaos of the Frankish empire, their modes of book-decoration began to
  diverge. The rudeness of an earlier time remains, with a good deal of spirit, in the illustrative
  designs produced in Germany; the beauty of French work began to decay, while the English was at
  its best. Winchester, Canterbury, and Glastonbury were the real centres of English art at the
  middle of the tenth century; the Norsemen having destroyed the Anglo-Irish monasteries in the
  north. This south English school is considered to have benefited materially by the technical
  superiority of French methods. What the north English schools of York and Lindisfarne had given to
  Tours in the eighth century, came back to Winchester at the end of the ninth, refined and
  embellished. Thus the supremacy of English art was assured at a time when French art was
  declining. The great variety, however, in all countries, of work done by different men, renders it
  difficult to draw general deductions. The calligraphic decoration of "Visigothic" and "Lombardic"
  manuscripts during the ninth, {60}tenth, and eleventh
  centuries is visibly Celtic in origin and style. Their pictorial illustration is sometimes very
  striking, and indicates the existence of several central schools of design in Europe. The English,
  the French, the German, the Spanish, and the Italian, had all certain qualities in common, but the
  first two were most nearly akin. The other three schools produced in the eleventh and twelfth
  centuries books containing pictures, in which the composition is more remarkable than the drawing,
  and the painting is full of barbaric contrasts of colour. At all times, fine work was to be found
  in Italy, but only in isolated examples, and Italy as a whole underwent the same barbarisation as
  the other countries. From that stage the English and the French were the first to emerge. They can
  hardly be said to have revived any former state of art in connexion with books. It was with
  them a real creation. The frequent reference to Byzantium as having supplied the models for
  European illuminated work is misleading. The first sign of actual contact with Byzantium is in the
  early part of the ninth century, when certain pictures produced in Carolingian MSS. show that the
  painters had been made aware of the existence of similar Byzantine work. And that is actually all
  that can be referred to as direct imitation of Byzantine art. The magnificent early examples of
  chrysography on purple vellum were not Byzantine but Eastern-Roman, and the Roman traditions of
  the Eastern capital lingered on into the ninth century, having begun to grow weaker at the end of
  the sixth. Italy was nearer and more potent in its influence upon barbaric art than Byzantium, and
  there was little difference in book-decoration between East Rome and West Rome till after the time
  of Justinian; so far as the cultivation of the arts was concerned. Consequently there is no need
  to look to Byzantium as having supplied models for the rest of Europe to follow. There is a
  difference of kind, not merely of degree, between the livres de luxe of the two Roman
  empires, and those of the new nations which began  span class="pagenum"
  id="page61">{61}with Irish work about A.D. 600, and ended with
  Italian and French work about 1550. The former were books written in gold, perhaps; perhaps
  decorated with red ink only; illustrated, maybe, with a picture or with pictures. The latter were
  books of which the principal characteristic was not their bookishness but their decorativeness. A
  set scheme of ornament sustained from beginning to end, with due proportion in the intervals, in
  which even the pictorial designs were subordinate to the decorative plan, constituted the value of
  the illuminated books of the European middle ages.

  Bibles and liturgical books in the twelfth century are remarkable for their large size and the
  quantity of decoration with which they were produced. In Germany, the method of ornament still
  repeats the Anglo-Saxon type derived from Carolingian work, and the handwriting is still
  Carolingian, but the letters lean forward instead of being upright, their forms are narrowed and
  chiselled off by short sharp terminal strokes that give an appearance of angularity. (An example
  of the art is given on plate 21.) In Spain, the beautiful round
  "Visigothic" letters are still retained, with large initials of interlaced Celtic pattern, and the
  illustrative pictures (if there are any) have the same style as had been developed some centuries
  earlier in Aquitaine. The German and the Spanish have a sort of resemblance by reason of their
  common origin, but more especially because of the striking combination of green and yellow in the
  paintings, the note of yellow apparently being strongest in the latter, and of green in the
  former. The use of green tints predominates likewise in English work of the eighth-twelfth
  centuries, but became much more sparing under the influence of the French school which, after the
  eleventh century, began to avoid indulgence in that colour. It never lost its favourite place in
  German art, and the MSS. of Holland and Flanders only dropped it when they began to assimilate
  French methods in the fourteenth century. England in the twelfth century  span class="pagenum"
  id="page62">{62}produced much finer work than the French. In fact the English school of
  that century was the parent of nearly all the art of the following century. Both in calligraphy
  and in pictorial designs, it forestalled the work done in the whole of Western Europe between 1200
  and 1300, which has rendered the thirteenth century the most noteworthy in the history of
  illustrated MSS. The mode and style of drawing, unfinished by illumination, which were practised
  in England towards the close of the thirteenth century, may be examined in  a
  href="#plate10">plate 10. Italian work of the same time is shown in plate
  11 to have been much more barbaric and unskilful. The difference between English
  twelfth-century work and that of Europe in the thirteenth century consisted in the large and ample
  freedom of hand which marks the former and the delicate minuteness which characterises alike the
  writing and the miniatures of the latter. As for style and quality of work, there is scarcely any
  difference between them. This new English school, so admirable in the twelfth and thirteenth
  centuries, had grown up over the decline of the Anglo-Saxon phase, which, fine as it was, had
  still somewhat of a barbaric air about it. The conquest of the Saxon monarchy by a Duke of
  Normandy in the eleventh century, and the succession in the twelfth of a Count of Anjou who united
  under his sceptre England, Normandy, and Aquitaine, made this country the centre of French art and
  literature for a considerable period. Hence the almost complete identity of the modes of writing
  and ornamentation between English and French work in the thirteenth century. In Central and
  South-eastern France the style varied somewhat as will be seen by comparing the examples given on
  plates 8 and 9. There is no school of art more
  interesting than the Anglo-Norman, as it is called, of that time. The illuminated border had not
  yet established itself, but the initials, drawn upon a ground of burnished gold or of diapered
  tints, enclose painted miniatures looking like very fine pen-and-ink designs carefully coloured.
  Bibles thus decorated are very {63}numerous. As they
  approach the end of the century, they exhibit now and then long straight lines, ending in curves
  or fleurons, which spread from the pictured initial upwards and downwards, and form a simple
  border to more than half the page. This incipient practice increased gradually from the beginning
  of the following century onwards. The fleurons became gold ivy-leaves, and similar leaves were
  figured as sprouting out from the long straight border-lines, these lines being extended so as to
  enclose the page on all sides. Still the effect was stiff and imperfect, but by the close of the
  fourteenth century, a very splendid kind of foliated border was used by French illuminators. The
  gold leaves called ivy-leaves were now introduced in greater number and made to sprout, no longer
  from the straight border frame itself, but more naturally out of branches which festooned from the
  frame. The ivy-leaf border in this state was very much favoured in French illumination, but was
  little used elsewhere. It generally accompanies pictorial illustration of superior merit, and
  gives an air of distinction and elegance to any MS. in which it is found. The French schools of
  Central France and of Paris had by the middle of the fourteenth century regained their lost
  pre-eminence in art.

  The thirteenth century was the first and the finest period of mediæval "gothic," so far as
  handwriting is concerned. (The name is a misnomer, but has a clear recognised sense, and is
  useful.) The letters are angulated at their extremities, but the bodies are still rounded and
  perfectly clear. The square and lapidar Gothic was introduced in the fourteenth century, and
  prevailed during that and the two succeeding centuries. It was a vicious script, indistinct and
  difficult to read; and although some examples, distinct, legible, and handsome, were brought out
  in the fifteenth century, the system was generally bad, and there is no reason to regret its
  extinction, which took place in France, Italy, and Spain about the middle of the sixteenth  span
  class="pagenum" id="page64">{64}century, and in England somewhat later, although it is
  lingering on even now in Germany and Denmark.

  The square Gothic of the fourteenth century, however unclear and objectionable as a script, was
  not ill adapted to ornamental purposes, as the vast number of prayerbooks for the laity produced
  between 1350 and 1400, and throughout the succeeding century, make manifest. Of those prayerbooks,
  which for a hundred and fifty years were the chief medium for displaying the skill of the mediæval
  illuminator, the number of copies which were made for individuals or families, as birth-day or
  wedding gifts, or for whatever reason, was incredibly large. The existence of such prayerbooks,
  well written and decorated with paintings, for private persons, is enough in itself to show that
  the office of calligrapher and miniaturist was a secular trade, and that the "old monks," to whom
  so many persons ascribe the writing of the "missals," had long ceased to be the sole producers of
  MSS.

  Not many of the earlier Books of Hours have survived, that is, of those which were written
  between 1300 and 1350; but from the latter date onwards to 1400 they are not uncommon, and from
  1400 onwards very numerous. This statement refers to French and Franco-Flemish and Burgundian
  work. Of English work, there are very few extant anterior to 1400, and the same may be said of
  Dutch examples. As for those written in Italy and Germany, it is only towards the close of the
  fifteenth century that they are met with. The English and French Hours produced during 1350-1420
  are very different in their mode of ornamentation. The Gothic writing was pretty nearly the same
  everywhere, and the larger illuminated initials had followed one model since the thirteenth
  century. These initials (when not historiated with little miniatures) were painted in colour upon
  a ground usually of gold. The space within the letter-forms was filled up with a conventional
  flower-pattern, having buds of red and blue tints. At the earlier  span class="pagenum"
  id="page65">{65}period the letter-form has a small extension upwards and downwards, in a
  simple style resembling wood-carving. In the fourteenth century this extension is increased, and
  the long straight border, with ivy-leaves here and there, was produced. While that kind of border
  was in France being developed into its most elegant phase, a different type was preferred in
  England. The gold ground of the initial is prolonged into a stem, around which twines a
  corresponding prolongation of coloured foliage springing from the curved extremities of the
  initial letter. Thus they form a border which would be pretty enough in itself, but which is
  further decorated with tufts of long feathery grass, tipped with buds, which grow out of the stem
  and sweep in graceful curves outside the line of foliage. This feathery ornament&mdash;which,
  except for the little fleurons in colour here and there, seems drawn with a fine pen in brown
  ink&mdash;is distinctly English, and was retained till late in the fifteenth century, side by side
  with newer methods borrowed from France. The red and blue, with white lights, which are used in
  the initials and capitals by the French illuminators, are in the English MSS. pink and pale blue,
  and the white lights are broader.

  As soon as the ivy-leaf pattern, with its brilliant gold points, began to go out of
  fashion in France, a new kind of border came into vogue. The conventional red and blue foliage
  still continued to spring out from the initials and at intervals below and above; all the
  intervening space was filled in with curling and twining tendrils, drawn with a pen or a very fine
  brush, forming a kind of hedge, in the midst of which were scattered here and there little natural
  flowers and fruits, growing out of the curled tendrils. This was in use in French and Burgundian
  and Flemish MSS. from about 1420-30 onwards, and became a favourite method of decoration in
  England towards the middle of the century. At that time, and in that style, prayerbooks done in
  the three countries are often much alike, and it is  span class="pagenum"
  id="page66">{66}only the painting of the miniatures and the differences in the calendar and
  litany which distinguish them.

  The chief Liturgical Books distinguished

  A word may be said here as to the means of distinguishing the liturgical MSS., and obtaining an
  idea of their place of origin. It ought not to be necessary, but, as a matter of fact, there are
  many persons of fair education, and possessing no inconsiderable familiarity with manuscripts, who
  call every Book of Hours a "Missal," and who cannot distinguish between a Breviary and a
  Missal.

  The Missal gives the service of the Mass for the whole year. Its essence lies in the Canon of
  the Mass, beginning with the words "Te igitur," which is preceded by a number of præfationes (some
  of them general, some of them appropriated to special occasions), and followed by the Communion
  and the concluding thanksgivings. This was in more ancient times the first and the larger part of
  the Mass-book, and was followed by a set of prayers, which in the service itself preceded and led
  to the Preface, these preliminary prayers being arranged under the festivals of the year from
  December to December. In the Missal, as arranged and enlarged in the thirteenth century, there are
  four divisions: 1. De Tempore (Sundays and festivals); 2. Prefaces, Canon, and Ordinary of the
  Mass; 3. Mass-prayers appropriated to special Saints' days; 4. Mass-prayers common to all Saints'
  days. The chronological order from Advent to Advent (30th November to 29th November) was followed,
  except in the case of some of the most solemn and ancient commemorations, and also of some special
  festivals that had been appointed after the original compilement of the Mass-book. These were
  incorporated in the part De Tempore, in succession to the text relating to the Advent. At the end
  of the fourth part were also added some of the special offices in regard to the laity, which had
  to be {67}performed by the priest, such as matrimony,
  baptism, and burial.

  The essence of the Breviary was the Psalter, which formed the groundwork of all the forms of
  devotion used at the Canonical Hours. With the appointed extracts from the Psalter a number of
  prayers were used, and these were divided in exactly the same way as those of the Missal into
  Temporal (of Sundays and festivals) in one sequence; and Sanctoral, in two sections, Proper and
  Common. The perpetually recurring rubrics of Matins, Lauds, Prime, Tierce, Sext, None, and Vespers
  (ad matutinas, in laudibus, ad primam, ad tertiam, ad sextam, ad nonam, ad vesperas) mark the
  hours of their use from midnight to midnight. These headings, repeated from day to day all over
  the year, ought to be sufficient even to the least observant eye to indicate the Breviary. It also
  contains at the end the offices of Marriage, Baptism, Burial, &amp;c.; and in some of the
  Breviaries the office of the Mass itself (not the whole Missal) is included.

  The Book of Hours (or Private Prayerbook) is a selection from the Breviary, and is likewise
  marked with the rubrics of the hours (Matins, Lauds, Nones, &amp;c.), but they are applied only to
  the offices selected, and do not contain the chronological divisions, Temporal and Sanctoral, for
  the year. The offices are usually those of the Virgin, of the Cross, of the Holy Ghost, of the
  Trinity, and these, with the Office for the Dead, and commemorations of some special Saints, form
  the chief bulk of the Horæ.

  The Calendar, which is found at the beginning, and the Litany (or Litanies) of Saints, which is
  found in the body, of each of the three books, are usually the most obvious sources of information
  with regard to the origin of the manuscript. If the use, or diocesan form of the liturgy,
  is purely Roman, as is sometimes the case even in books written in France, Flanders, and England,
  then the search is frustrated. It happens, however, frequently that even  span class="pagenum"
  id="page68">{68}the Roman Calendar and the Roman Litany are enlarged by the addition of
  names to which a special local veneration was paid, and then one is able to discover hints of
  origin which may indicate either a country or a diocese. In the French books, the number of French
  Saints is usually considerable, that is of French Saints who do not appear in the Roman calendar,
  but they are generally gathered impartially from all the dioceses. It is only when we find that a
  single diocese furnishes the names of two or three canonised bishops, or when a name appears in
  gold in the calendar which had no special importance for the whole of the country, but must have
  had a particular interest in one city or diocese, that we can begin to think of special
  attributions. Thus, if St. Ives (Yvo), Ste. Genevieve, St. Germain, St. Leufroy, St. Louis, S.
  Faro, St. Ursin, St. Saintin, St. Saturnin, Ste. Radegonde, St. Fiacre, St. Austrebert, and many
  others, are found in the Calendar, and any of them in the Litany, it is a sure proof of French
  origin. If St. Saturnin appears in gold in the Calendar, it serves to indicate Toulouse; if St.
  Sainctin, Meaux; Martial, Limoges; Firmin, Metz or Amiens; and if SS. Ursin, Guillaume, and
  Austregisile occur together in the Litany, they point out Bourges&mdash;all three having been
  Archbishops of that see. But in all cases collateral or cumulative testimony is required.

  Saints Vedastus and Amandus (Vaast and Amand), although belonging to Flanders, may occur either
  in French or Flemish Calendars; but when they are combined with Bavo and Bertin, and Quintin and
  Aldegund, they indicate Ghent or its vicinity as the place of origin. St. Piat, St. Lehyre (or
  Eleutherius), and St. Guillain point to Tournay. St. Valery or Walery (Walaricus) is another
  Flemish Saint, as also are Audomar, Gaugericus, Godeleve, Winnoc, and Amelberga. As for MSS. of
  Flemish origin, it must be remembered that the word Flemish is loosely used to designate all
  portions of the Low Countries except the {69}purely Dutch
  provinces, and that Artois and Picardy and other portions of the French Pays Reconquis of
  the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were part of them. In the same way Franche Comté and the
  Duchies of Burgundy and Lorraine were also outside of France in the fifteenth century; and
  Languedoc and Provence and Dauphiné were late additions to the French monarchy. The words Flemish
  (in its fullest sense) and French have therefore to be used with caution. Even Brittany was only
  incorporated at the end of the fifteenth century.

  Manuscript liturgies of English origin of any date are unmistakable by reason of the saints'
  names. St. Thomas a Becket is not one of the distinctive ones, for he was worshipped
  everywhere; but all the English books, whether they be of Roman use, or of Salisbury or York use,
  contain the names of SS. Alban, Cuthbert, Aldhelm, Guthlac, Botulph, Grimbald, Edward, Richard,
  Edmund, Swithin, Dunstan, Etheldreda, Edith, Winifrid, Chad, John of Beverley. The names of St.
  Wilfrid, St. William, St. Hilda, St. Aidan, St. Bede, and St. Everilda, are proofs of York and
  northern use; St. Milburga, St. Guthlac, and St. Thomas Cantilupe indicated Hereford, as also does
  St. Osytha, although one name alone is not sufficient. St. Wulfstan points to Worcester, St. Hugh
  to Lincoln, but not always. Aldatus, Kinburga, Egwin, and Elwin, are only found in books of
  Gloucester or western origin. St. Erkenwald always indicates London or the south.

  Scottish liturgies of the kind are very rare, and contain the names of saints not elsewhere met
  with. There can be no doubt as to the origin beyond the border of a book which either in its
  calendar or its Litany gives the names of Kentigern, Ninian, Aidan, Adamnan, Monan, Queen
  Margaret, Duthac, and Modoc. Even any one of these names is sufficient, although Adamnan, Aidan,
  and Ninian might possibly appear on this side of the Tweed, as well as St. Adrian who was likewise
  Scottish.

  {70}

  Special German saints are Gotthard, Lambert (not always), Adelbert, Bernward, Sebald, Swibert,
  Cunegund, Hermenegild, Willibald, Kilian, Hedwig, Wolfgang, Irmin.

  Among the saints of the Spanish calendar are Isidore, Ildefonsus, Eulalia, Raimund, Leocadia,
  Gumersind, Baldomer, Leander, Braulio, Turibius, Quiteria, Froilan. There is sometimes a curious
  coincidence between the Spanish and the German calendars. The Spanish coincidences with the
  calendar of Southern France are more easily to be accounted for.

  The Italian saints are always those of the Roman calendar, but St. Zenobio is
  seldom found outside of Tuscany. SS. Bernardinus of Siena and Nicolas of Tolentinum are Italian
  saints of the fifteenth century more frequently found in Italian calendars (after 1450) than in
  calendars of other countries. In the case of the latter two, their names are sometimes useful in
  fixing a limit for the age of a book, because MSS. of the time of their canonisation are numerous.
  The dates of beatification of some earlier saints such as Thomas Becket, Francis, Dominic, and
  King Louis, are also occasionally of service; but as a rule the names of the saints in the
  calendars are far older than the thirteenth century.

  The Fourteenth Century in Italy and Germany

  To go back to the fourteenth century. In Italy the broken Lombard had given way to the general
  adoption of the modern gothic. Some excellent decorative work began to appear in the borders and
  miniatures of MSS. executed in Northern and Central Italy. As a rule in the earlier times, Italian
  miniatures were rude in drawing, and barbaric in colour like German and Spanish work; but in the
  thirteenth century a distinct Italian type arose, based at first on imitation of the
  semi-Byzantine art of Calabria and Sicily; but soon growing more national under the influence of
  Giotto. There is no resemblance in style or manner between the miniatures and borders of Italian
  artists, and {71}those of Northern Europe. The figures
  and faces are painted with opaque colour, and a broad brush; giving altogether a stronger
  impression of representing real men and women, than the exquisite drawing of the French artists,
  in which faces were washed with colour after having had the features drawn in with a pen or a fine
  brush. (Plate 12 shows the style of illustration used at Venice in the
  first half of the fourteenth century, in which there is a curious combination of French-like
  calligraphy with the painty miniatures of the home school of art.) There was in fact more of
  modelling in the Italian illuminator's work in its purely national stage from about 1350 to
  1450. After the later date a more subtle and minute delicacy in the drawing altered the character
  of the pictorial work. The borders which prevailed during 1320 to 1420 are also quite different
  from French work. Broad foliage of architectonic pattern hangs in soft tints of red and blue from
  a long upright slender pole like an ornamental curtain-rod, and little buds or drops of burnished
  gold fall here and there within the line of sight, but there is no attempt to fill up the spaces
  with any elaborate scheme of twining branches and real leaves and flowers, as in the French
  parallels. The writing is usually square and gothic, but with few of the oblique angles and little
  projecting points that are seen in Western gothic. The Lombardic hand of Eastern and Southern
  Italy, had left no trace in the script which succeeded it. The round and beautiful Carolingian
  letter of North Italy had a distinct influence in moulding the Italian gothic, and preserving its
  freedom from Teutonic angularities. It had lasted longer here than in other countries, but Spanish
  Visigothic was also a late lingerer, and did not succumb to French influence till the thirteenth
  century.

  In Germany, the fourteenth century proceeded as elsewhere to produce a closely
  packed difficult Gothic letter, and also to introduce an ugly cursive which came generally into
  use in the next century. In decoration, the old  span class="pagenum"
  id="page72">{72}Germanic style had given way to the influence of French and Italian work,
  and a sort of new school was created, which in the following century became distinctively German.
  The cursive writing alluded to was an ugly rapid script deformed from the minuscule, which was
  very largely used in the fifteenth century, and developed in time the handwriting which still
  prevails in Germany, although gradually giving way to the Roman.

  English Work in the Fourteenth Century

  The cursive hand in England, as used between 1250 and 1550 for all purposes, and in legal
  documents for a long time afterwards, seems to have grown up in the early part of the thirteenth
  century. It is quite unlike the earlier charter hand, although it must have been derived from it.
  For the first century or more of its use, it is remarkable by reason of the long strokes which are
  broad and heavy above, but taper into thin lines below, those heavy heads being bifurcated in the
  earlier times and looped in the later. During the thirteenth and a great part of the fourteenth
  century it looked handsome, and could be read without difficulty; from the late part of the
  fourteenth century onwards it deteriorated both in aspect and in clearness. Nothing resembling
  this English hand was used on the continent, except (in a slight degree) in the notes written
  sometimes on the margins of philosophical and legal books, by means of a hard leaden stylus.
  Another cursive was also employed, which was merely the rapid writing of the gothic minuscule,
  like that of Germany; but this appeared rather on the continent.

  It has been remarked that the Norman conquest introduced a new fashion in writing; but the
  observation is too strong. That event led gradually to the disuse of writing in the angular
  Anglo-Saxon letters, but had little influence on the fashion of the script used for writing Latin,
  which had become round and clear since the tenth century. The  span class="pagenum"
  id="page73">{73}Carolingian reformation had failed to supersede the Anglo-Irish hand, but
  its influence extended far enough to improve the shape even of the purely English letters. In
  Ireland, the angular character had fixed its type which has not since varied.

  At the beginning of the fourteenth century, the English, as has been said above,
  began to relinquish the lead in calligraphy and ornamentation, which they had held since the
  twelfth. The Latin Bibles which had been produced towards the end of the twelfth century were
  usually folios of good size, written in a large and fine hand, and decorated with miniatures of
  the type seen in the Huntingfield Psalter. The fashion of the thirteenth century inclined to work
  of smaller dimensions, and the Bibles came out in small octavo or duodecimo size until the end of
  the century approached, when there was a tendency to revert to small folios. In the fourteenth
  century, a favourite size was quarto or small quarto. The illustrations in MSS. of both twelfth
  and thirteenth centuries, and of the beginning of the fourteenth, were similar in style, but
  varying in appearance according to the space allowed the artist.

  French Work in the Fourteenth Century

  The French took the lead in the fourteenth century, especially during the second
  half. There was not much to choose in the writing of the time in any country, but it was best in
  Italy. It was in the dainty adornment of their illuminated MSS., and in the fine and delicate
  beauty of the pictorial designs, that the French school now assumed its place of pre-eminence. The
  Apocalypse was a favourite book in the first half of this century, as it had been in the twelfth,
  and artists delighted in drawing pictures of its strange visions. These pictures were seldom quite
  original in design, since the earliest delineations had acquired a sort of traditional authority,
  but they were sufficiently variant in {74}particulars to
  exhibit the strength of the artist. Diapered and chequered patterns came more prominently into
  fashion along with the older use of burnished gold, for backgrounds; and a great deal of excellent
  work was done. An example from a French Apocalypse is given on plate 13. In
  most cases, the picture was drawn with a fine brush and the colours delicately washed in
  afterwards. French artists attained to singular perfection in this dainty method of illustration,
  and nothing of the kind excels some of the superior specimens. Amongst them will be found a number
  of charming Books of Hours executed at Bourges, Tours, and Paris, for Charles V of France and his
  brothers. Whatever may be thought of the beautiful paintings in Flemish and Italian MSS. at the
  end of the fifteenth century, it is undeniable that the last thirty years of the fourteenth
  produced French work which will hold its own against the illumination of any period or of any
  country. It is curious as showing how little the warfare against Edward III had affected the
  progress of art in France.

  The Fifteenth Century

  The second half of the fourteenth century saw a dynasty of French princes established in the
  Duchy of Burgundy, and the union of the states which had belonged to the Counts of Flanders, to
  the Duke's dominions. These political circumstances had the effect of diverting some of the best
  French miniaturists to the court of Philippe le Hardi, and of founding a grand Burgundian school
  of art, which led to the creation of the Flemish one. The Burgundian MSS. of the first half of the
  fifteenth century were usually executed at Dijon (the capital of the Duchy) or Besancon; and were
  thus simply works of French art, not very different in style from those produced at Bourges,
  Nevers, and Auxerre; but a certain local type was developed in the ornamental borders of the
  miniatures; and as soon as the political centre of gravity  span class="pagenum"
  id="page75">{75}was shifted northwards, by reason of the greater wealth and importance of
  the Low Countries, Bruges and Brussels became the chief towns in Philip the Good's dominions, and
  a new element was introduced into Burgundian art. The Flemish artists of Bruges, Lille, and Liege
  had been renowned since the middle of the fourteenth century for their skill in miniature
  painting, and Van Eyck himself was a dependent of Philippe le Bon, in whose service he spent the
  last nine years of his life at Bruges (1432-1440). It is supposed that the earlier Flemish artists
  were the creators of grisaille painting, although that beautiful mode of pictorial illustration is
  first found in French books of the middle of the fourteenth century. (A specimen is given on  a
  href="#plate14">plate 14.) The finest examples of grisaille were produced by Flemish artists
  at Bruges between 1440 and 1470, and a book of Hours, illuminated for Jaquot de Brégilles in 1443,
  in the possession of the writer, is one of remarkable beauty. Another fine specimen, of somewhat
  later date, is the Miroir Historial, a miniature from which is reproduced on  a
  href="#plate17">plate 17. Side by side with this kind of chaste work, splendid illumination of
  the rich French style was practised in Flanders, and a favourable example is given of a Book of
  Hours painted at Tournay about 1460, on plate 16.

  Grisaille painting originated evidently from the suggestions of carved stone-work in
  cathedral-decoration. The figures of saints occupying niches, which were familiar to the visitants
  of churches, were the first models that led to the painting of miniatures with the figures in grey
  tints. It must have been, for a true artist, delightful to triumph over the difficulty of
  achieving the effects of relief and of modelling with the aid of a single pigment only. To be the
  master of such an art, and to handle the monochrome in such a way as to run with perfect touch
  through a gamut of gradations in tone, would surely have been more gratifying than to win success
  by the splendour of full illumination. The artist did not, however, entirely abstain  span
  class="pagenum" id="page76">{76}from the use of gold; he allowed it to shine on the crowns
  of kings and around the heads of his saints; and colour was used sparingly in the backgrounds.
  These backgrounds in the pictures of earlier date were ornamental diapered surfaces, but after the
  first decade or two of the fifteenth century, landscape backgrounds made their appearance. It was,
  however, some time before the miniaturist succeeded in realising effects of distance, and thus
  producing true pictures as distinguished from ornamental historiation. The Italians were the first
  to gain a tolerable knowledge of perspective, but the Flemings were not much behind them. It was
  not, however, till late in the fifteenth century that anything like a faithful expression of
  perspective is found in the miniatures of MSS.

  In the latter part of the fifteenth century, pure grisaille was extended into
  camaieu; that is, the monochrome might be any other colour than grey, so long as it was used in
  the same manner. This, however, was usually confined to parts of miniatures, and not inconsistent
  with a lavish use of gold for the lights, and masses of different colour in other portions of the
  same picture. The quantity of gold that gave magnificence to the work of the miniaturist in
  Flanders and France in the last quarter of the fifteenth century became excessive. It was a relief
  to the eye when this blaze of gold receded before the outcome of late Flemish art. Scarcely any
  school produced work comparable for delicacy and truth to the miniatures painted in prayerbooks at
  Bruges and Ghent between 1490 and 1520.

  Illuminated Borders in the Fifteenth Century

  After the year 1400, as has been already said, the private Prayerbooks, or Books of
  Hours, which at that time were used in France and England, but not to any great extent elsewhere,
  began to increase in numbers and develop new styles of ornament. The pages with illuminated  span
  class="pagenum" id="page77">{77}initials still preserved the older border, the basis of
  which was a double line of gold and colour issuing from the initial and running squarely round the
  page. At the corners and at intervals gold branches, bearing gold and coloured ivy-leaves, went
  forth in somewhat stiff curves to form the outer decoration of the border. This was in French MSS.
  In the English ones, heavy masses of gold and colour representing conventional foliage appeared at
  the corners, and out of the border-lines emerged the long sweeping tufts of feathery grass with
  red and blue buds, which have been already alluded to. Towards 1430 the ivy-leaves lost their
  prominence in France, and were only preserved in portion of the ornament. The straight framing
  lines were abandoned both in England and France, and a broader border was obtained by a methodical
  arrangement of hundreds of curling hair-lines, black or brown, out of which sprung little red and
  blue flowers of natural appearance. This pattern was drawn and massed so as to represent a broad
  frame, even and square, enclosing the page. This became a customary mode of ornamentation in both
  countries, so that a large proportion of English and French work was much alike in style, though
  not always in execution. When the middle of the century arrived, a modification began to take
  place in French MSS.; the fine black hair-lines of the borders gave place to wreathing green
  branches, less numerous, and thus more proportionate in quantity. The flowers and leaves springing
  from them became more numerous, more natural and less conventional. By this time Burgundian and
  Flemish Livres d'Heures were also produced in large numbers, and brilliant pictures of blossoms
  growing in the rich gardens of Burgundy added the weight of their influence to the tendency
  towards floral decoration. The flowers in the borders grew more realistic and varied, and were
  sometimes fine large examples of their species. This method was followed in England as well as in
  France. Next appeared {78}in continental work
  backgrounds, either of gold or of colour, to the borders; which had previously been painted on the
  plain vellum. Finally, in France it became fashionable to break the border into spaces (taking
  various shapes), of which some had gold grounds and some were without grounds; or to treat the
  border in such a fashion that the branches and flowers should appear partly on gold, partly on
  russet, partly on blue, or in other combinations. This bizarre fashion did not take the taste
  either of English or of Flemish artists. The English retained their crowded border of flowers and
  branches painted on the plain vellum, while the Flemings began to paint rich natural cut flowers
  upon a monochromatic ground of pale gold or yellow. On this pale ground, free from all the
  convolution of twining branches seen in French and English work, they were enabled to throw
  shadows beneath the cut flowers, so that these appeared to stand out in strong relief, with
  excellent effect. The new fashion at once found copyists everywhere; the celebrated Hours of Anne
  of Brittany is one of the finer French examples. The imitations done in England were not very
  successful.

  End of the Fifteenth Century

  We now reach the last decade of the fifteenth century; in which the late Flemish school already
  alluded to arose in Bruges and Ghent. In combination with those beautiful borders of fresh cut
  flowers painted in apparent relief upon pale gold or yellow, the delicate art of Memling and
  Gerard David produced small and exquisite miniatures with architectural and landscape accessories;
  the like of which had not yet been seen in the illustration of books, unless we find a parallel in
  the lovely and no less exquisite pictures in Florentine manuscripts of the same period. The
  radical difference between the work of the north and that of the  span class="pagenum"
  id="page79">{79}south&mdash;notwithstanding that each of them betrays to some extent the
  influence of the other&mdash;is, that the Fleming took his types from real life, the Florentine
  from his conceptions of angelic existence.

  All the rest of Europe was behind the two favoured countries in which pictorial and decorative
  art now reached their culminating point. Sentimental writers have been, from time immemorial, in
  the habit of scouting at wealth and of pouring enthusiastic praise upon penury, as though the two
  conditions were equivalent to vice and virtue in morals, to dulness and genius in intellect. It is
  quite true that an impoverished state of society produces better poetry than a rich one; but it is
  equally true that the finest artistic work is born amid luxurious surroundings. It was the wealth
  of Ghent, Bruges, Antwerp, and Brussels which attracted talent to a warmer air in which it could
  grow and flourish, on the border land between the Celt and the Teuton, with all the advantages
  derivable from either side. In the same way the riches and luxury of Venice, Florence, Rome,
  Naples, Verona, Cremona, Padua, stimulated the faculties of men who had inherited the traditions
  of Græco-Roman art. It was a brilliant autumn in the annals of illumination, but a short one, by
  reason of the changes which the new art of Printing had brought about in all things. Dürer visited
  Bruges and Venice; he admired the work of Gerard David and of the Italian miniaturists, but he did
  not seek to imitate or to rival their efforts. He belonged to the modern world, and he gave to the
  art of engraving what he would, twenty years earlier, have given to the art of illumination. We
  have nothing to do here with his profession as a painter of canvases in which he followed the same
  tendency as had during the fifteenth century so wonderfully multiplied the number of Giotto's
  descendants in Italy. We may imagine, if we choose, what wonderful illuminators of manuscripts
  were lost in Schongauer, Dürer, and Lucas van Leyden, three men who owed  span class="pagenum"
  id="page80">{80}their artistic existence and taste to the atmosphere of rich cities. From
  the year 1450 the career of Calligrapher and Illuminator had been doomed to extinction. Its
  members gradually retired from an unequal strife with the clever mechanics from Mentz; some became
  printers, some became engravers, and others joined the ranks of the canvas-painters. Those who
  remained true to their early training achieved the most brilliant triumphs of their profession
  before it was extinguished. This is the reason why we look to the Flanders, and to the Italy of
  1480-1520, for the most absolutely perfect work that was ever produced in the illumination of
  manuscripts. Considering that it flourished side by side with the paintings of the Bellinis and of
  Andrea Mantegna, and that it was in touch with the times of Lionardo, of Raphael, of Michel
  Angiolo, of Titian, and of Paolo Veronese, we cannot wonder either at its marvellous beauty or at
  its sudden withering.

  Of the late Flemish school, certain work done for the Austrian Archduchess Margaret (resident
  in Bruges with her brother Philip, as children of Maximilian who had become sovereign of the Low
  Countries in right of his wife Mary of Burgundy), of which the famous Grimani Breviary is only one
  amongst some ten or twelve examples&mdash;was the finest of its kind. The present writer has
  possessed one of them&mdash;a little volume internally justifying the tradition that it was
  illuminated by Gerard David for the Archduchess

  
    ( . &nbsp; . &nbsp; Margot la gente demoiselle
    Qu' eut deux maris et si mourut pucelle
  

  as she once suggested for her own epitaph when in danger from a storm at sea) for presentation
  to her sister-in-law Juana, the heiress of Castile (Juana la Loca, the Crazy Jane who has become a
  personage in nursery lore).

  As for the Italian school, it was of wider extent. The illuminators found generous patrons at
  Milan, at Venice, at Padua, at Cremona, at Verona, at Florence, at Bologna, at Rome, and at
  Naples. In the last city, the Kings of {81}Aragonese
  origin were noble employers of talent, and found their chief rivals in the Medicis, and in Mathias
  Corvinus, the King of Hungary, who divided with them the patronage of the best Italian
  miniaturists. They also helped to stamp on Spanish work the Italian impress which characterises it
  in the last half of the fifteenth century, and thereby to continue the line which in contact with
  Naples on the one hand, with Bruges on the other, formed at the end of the century a ring, uniting
  Flanders and Italy as its chief jewels.

  The name of Attavante, so famous as a Florentine miniaturist, reminds me of a Petrarch
  manuscript which I have seen sold in Paris as illustrated by him. One of the illuminations
  contained a bust of a Roman warrior, in the style so frequently seen in Italian work of about the
  year 1500, and under it were the initials M.A., intended evidently for Marcus Aurelius or Marcus
  Antonius. Out of them, the cataloguers of two different collections of great repute, had evolved
  the idea that they stood for "Maestro Attavante"&mdash;an absurd notion for which there was
  absolutely no excuse whatever. Other famous Italian miniaturists were Girolamo dai Libri of
  Verona, and Sigismondo da Carpio. I have had examples of the art of both. One still more
  celebrated was Giulio Clovio, but he belonged entirely to the sixteenth century and to the late
  Renaissance, and his work is in nowise that of the Middle Ages. It is over-florid and reveals the
  theatrical splendour which always accompanies decline. I have possessed one of his finest
  examples, which was formerly in the Towneley library.

  During the last twenty years of the fifteenth century, a favourite style of border among the
  Italians was an imitation of goldsmith's work. Gems of various colours set in gold, with cameos or
  medallions of classic busts, were the chief feature, but spaces were always left in which the
  miniaturist could paint his tiny exquisite figures of the fight between David and Goliath, or
  something of the kind. Venetian {82}examples of such
  miniatures are remarkably beautiful&mdash;the beauty mingled with a certain gravity of manner;
  those which are of Roman origin have an air of masterly splendour; but those which were produced
  at Florence between 1480 and 1510 are so lovely as to upset our critical judgment in comparing
  them with work done at Bruges. In the border-illustration there never was any resemblance between
  the work of Italy and that of other countries, and there can be no hesitation in deciding between
  them in favour of Italy as more appropriately decorative.

  I possess a Psalter written and illuminated for Pietro dei Medici, apparently about 1490, in
  which the first two pages are stained light green, so as to soften and make delicate the numerous
  tints found in the painting and border upon one of them. These are the work probably of Attavante,
  and can hardly be excelled for the exquisite taste and finish both of the miniature and of the
  ornamentation. I have also had a charming little Prayerbook written for Lorenzo the Magnificent,
  which was evidently from the same hand; and a Siennese Psalter of kindred type and of the same
  period. The loveliness of these Tuscan examples takes away all possibility of critical
  fault-finding. They delight the eye with a fuller satisfaction than even the best of the Flemish
  illuminations. The latter we examine carefully, with a continual increase of admiration; while we
  enjoy the harmonious beauty of the Florentine, we feel that the critic's functions are set
  aside.

  The writing of the late Italian MSS., among which classical texts rival the books of prayers in
  the elegance of their adornment, was more frequently Roman than gothic, but a fine black-letter
  hand survived into the sixteenth century, especially at Venice. The initials decorated with
  interlacements, in a style that evinced its Irish origin, which are found in Italian manuscripts
  after 1350 were retained till near the end of the fifteenth century in Venice and Naples, but they
  had fallen out of use in Tuscany {83}somewhat earlier,
  being hardly appropriate to the rich neo-classical style of Florentine border-decoration.

  As for the Italian styles of writing after the twelfth century, they were various.
  The Carolingian in a bold and handsome type lasted longer in Italy than elsewhere; but both it and
  the Lombard were passing away about the year 1200. The thirteenth century saw the evolution of the
  gothic letter out of the Carolingian, in Italy as well as over the rest of Europe, but in Italy it
  was accompanied by a sort of Carolingian cursive, slightly sloped, which finally developed the two
  forms now familiar over all the world&mdash;Roman and Italic. In the fourteenth century a
  beautiful square gothic letter was in use in Italy, and remained unaltered in form till the end of
  the fifteenth; but it was not unaccompanied by various other styles of writing. The Italic was
  still in its primitive stage without elegance, and some books were written in a gothic letter
  derived from French and German models, and quite unlike the square Italian gothic. The script of
  the book, from which a facsimile is given on plate 12, is an example of
  this outlandishness. Before the fifteenth century arrived the cursive hand had split into its two
  branches. The more elaborately written letters were upright, and tended to restore the Carolingian
  original; the less elaborate characters began to slope still further, and by degrees became a
  separate script, which then became cultivated. The writing of Petrarch (who died in 1374) was
  chosen as the model for the first Italic types used in printing (1501); and the upright round hand
  used by numerous Florentine and Venetian calligraphers towards the middle of the fifteenth century
  was chosen as the model of the first Roman types, cut by Sweynheym and Pannartz in the Benedictine
  monastery of Subbiaco, not far from Rome, in the year 1464.

  Remarks on the subjects reproduced in the plates

  The first plate represents portion of a hieroglyphical  span
  class="pagenum" id="page84">{84}text written on a roll of papyrus which was wrapped up with
  the mummy of the man whose virtues are recorded on it. As for the exact age and contents of the
  roll, it is beyond my capacity to say anything definite; but there is a delicacy in the drawing of
  the figures and in the formation of the letters which seem to indicate a considerable age,
  probably not less than twelve hundred years B.C. Each column of the
  writing has to be read from top to bottom, beginning with the first column on the left. It has
  been said in an earlier page that the hieratic and demotic scripts differed from the hieroglyphic
  in being written like Hebrew in long horizontal lines from right to left. The difference is,
  however, merely formal. If we turn the hieroglyphic page half round, so that the right side
  becomes the bottom, and the left side the top of the page, we can see the inscription run in
  hieratic fashion from right to left.

  Plate 2 is perhaps more difficult to decipher than Plate 1. We know,
  however, that the demotic script was used only amongst laymen in matters of business and of money;
  and this no doubt represents some commercial transaction that took place between 500 and 200  span
  class="smaller">B.C. The demotic was a complex cursive evolved from the hieratic; its
  invention, or at least its use to any considerable degree, does not appear to have been much
  antecedent to 600 B.C., and there was little necessity for its
  continuance after the second century B.C.

  It was probably about the beginning of the Christian era that the demotic finally disappeared
  before the Coptic, an alphabet derived from the Greek, of which Plate 3
  gives an example. The Arabic heading which accompanies the Coptic rubric above the Psalm that
  begins below (the 118th &rho;&iota;&eta;), is in a hand of
  the latter part of the fifteenth century. Notwithstanding the lateness of the specimen, the script
  takes its proper place here as representing a script of the first century.

  Plate 4 is taken from a copy, written on vellum at  span class="pagenum"
  id="page85">{85}Nablús, of the Samaritan Pentateuch. Both in language and in letters it
  represents the old Hebrew of the days of Solomon, long anterior to the time when Ezra introduced
  from Chaldæa the square characters now called Hebrew; the ancient letters having been preserved by
  a small remnant in North Palestine. The writing resembles that of the Ph&#x0153;nicians, and the
  example given on plate 4, notwithstanding its lateness, does not exhibit a very much modified form
  of the character.

  Plate 5 is from an Abyssinian MS. of the sixteenth century, on the Life
  of the Virgin. The real origin of the artistic decoration is unmistakable. It is what we call
  Byzantine, but ought rather to be called Ægypto-Grecian. The people of Abyssinia, who were mainly
  Southern Arabs or Sabæans, received their instruction in art along with their Christianity a few
  centuries after the beginning of the era, and they have never abandoned them. As for the writing
  which appears on the plate, it is in the old Geez or Ethiopic language, and descended from that of
  the Sabæan people whose monumental inscriptions in Himyaritic language and characters are now
  attracting considerable interest.

  Plate 6 is from a Greek Gospelbook written on vellum, which was brought
  to England from Cyprus by Cesnola. The ornamental border at the top is somewhat freer and less
  stiff in style than those which we find in most of the Byzantine MSS.; and the writing is neater
  and less negligent than if it had been executed in the eleventh or twelfth century. It slopes a
  little backwards and has the breathings in their antique form as halves of the letter H.
  Hence I have assigned it to the latter part of the tenth century.

  On plate 7 I have given a reduction after Westwood of a page from an
  Irish MS. now in the Archiepiscopal Library at Lambeth. Although it is of comparatively late date
  (the ninth century), and the writing is the Irish script in its second or wholly minuscule stage,
  the ornamentation is {86}sufficient to show what Irish
  work had been and still was. The marvellously elaborate convolutions and interlacements, the
  dexterous use of colours, the utter absence of gold, and the introduction of grotesque animal
  figures, are all seen in this plate from the Gospelbook of MacDurnan. (While I write I am reminded
  of a personal experience which I may be forgiven for setting down in print. When Westwood's great
  book had come out, I was one day speaking with an English lady of high social position, cultivated
  and accomplished in many branches of knowledge, to whom after mentioning Westwood I expressed my
  admiration of what the Irish calligraphers had done in the seventh and eighth centuries, when art
  was so low in most of the other lands of Europe. The lady listened with patient good-breeding,
  till I paused, and then said quietly, "I presume that you are yourself an Irishman!" She had
  evidently mistaken one unfamiliar accent for another, and her remark was a polite criticism upon
  my credulity or veracity.)

  Plate 21 (which ought to have been inserted in succession to plate 7)
  reproduces a miniature from a Breviary written about 1150-60 for Isengrim, Abbot of the
  Benedictine Monastery at Ottenbeuern in Suabia.

  The miniature reproduced is a picture of the Ascension, and shows the Saviour standing in an
  almond-shaped frame, supported and borne aloft by four angels. The Virgin and the Apostles are
  looking upwards from below, and the picture is enclosed within a square blue border, this being
  lighted by ornamental fretwork in white. The faces are generally well drawn, and the rapt
  attention in the eyes of the uplookers is very skilfully depicted. The colours used are blue,
  green, yellow, red, chesnut, and white. The whole effect is reminiscent of Anglo-Saxon work, and
  one might easily, at first sight, mistake it for a picture out of an English book of the tenth
  century. A somewhat similar design of the same subject is found in King Athelstan's
  Psalter&mdash;an Anglo-Saxon MS. of the late ninth century, now  span class="pagenum"
  id="page87">{87}in the British Museum; but the Suabian illustration is decidedly inferior
  in taste and delicacy of treatment. It shows, however, such a kinship that we are inclined to
  believe in a nearer connexion between German and English art than between German and French
  Carolingian.

  Plates 8 and 9 reproduce miniatures from two
  manuscripts of the Latin Bible,&mdash;the first page of Genesis in each. The first is either
  English or Norman work, perhaps rather the latter than the former, and is interesting as affording
  one of the earliest examples of the border with leaves of the so-called ivy pattern. The writing
  is a beautiful early gothic of the transition period between the Carolingian round hand and the
  mediæval square gothic. It is unmistakably Norman, if not Anglo-Norman, but may have been English.
  If the reds in the tiny miniatures had been a little more pinkish, and the blue a little lighter,
  we should have had no hesitation in calling it English work. In plate 9, the
  writing is somewhat rounder and the ink is paler&mdash;showing that the work is neither English
  nor Norman; and we find in the minute pictures a style of design, both in the figures and the
  draperies, which reminds us of late classical art. The interlaced pattern in the lowest portion of
  the ornament is also a survival of the Celtic manner which might be found in Southern France, but
  which had ceased to be used in English work, except in the decoration of letters. On the plate,
  the picture is dated "1310-20"; but we may venture to think that it was executed in South-Eastern
  France about the year 1300.

  The design and the writing on plate 10 are thoroughly English of the end
  of the thirteenth century. The picture is unfinished, having been left by the artist in its
  sketch-condition, uncoloured. The faces are blank, and the drawing simply in outline; but the
  careful treatment of the folds in the drapery is remarkable. The miniature is one of several
  illustrating the Apocalypse, which were done in the convent at Eaton or Nun-Eaton in Warwickshire
  about 1280. The {88}Apocalypse is not given in its Latin
  summaries, as was usual, but in French quatrains of English origin. The volume which contains
  these drawings is interesting, as having been a sort of omnium gatherum, made up for the
  ladies of Eaton at the end of the thirteenth century. One of the pieces it contains is a Bestiaire
  by William the Trouvère, an Englishman of the twelfth century; a French poem called the Chastel
  d'Amours by Raymond Grosseteste; and a popular English poem of the time, of which another example
  has been lately published in facsimile in his "English Palæography" by the Rev. Walter W.
  Skeat.

  The miniature of the Crucifixion which is reproduced on plate 11 is
  visibly Italian work of the rudest style. It is taken from a Missal, written in a hand which is
  also Italian of the end of the thirteenth century, but gothic in form. The liturgical character of
  the book is, however, such that we may believe it to have been produced in England, perhaps by an
  Italian Cistercian monk. The writing on the miniature is in so-called Lombardic uncials, a script
  which was used for capitals nearly everywhere in the thirteenth century. The three figures in the
  picture have red or auburn hair, a favourite colour at all times among the Italians, even after
  the Flemings had introduced a blackhaired Christ. Another noticeable feature is the building with
  an arcade and windows, in the lower background.

  Plate 12 is an illustration of the story of Troilus and Cressida, taken
  from Guido Colonna's Tale of Troy. It is Venetian, of about the years 1330-40, and exhibits the
  Italian style of using strong pigments for their figures. Whatever the faults of drawing may be,
  this is a real painting done with a full brush. There is no appearance of the outlines drawn with
  a pen or a fine brush, such as we see in French and English work, and the folds in the draperies
  appear to be produced by broad shadowings after the main body of colour had been painted. In fact,
  it seems to be, like other Italian illuminations, the work of a painter, not  span class="pagenum"
  id="page89">{89}of a miniaturist. The place of origin is revealed by the calligrapher's
  instructions to the artist, which occur on several pages in a minute hand, and which are written
  in a pure Venetian dialect. The manuscript is illustrated with an unusual quantity of pictorial
  designs. The writing is remarkable as resembling that of the English charters of the same period,
  but with greater regularity and evenness in the downstrokes.

  Plate 13 is reproduced from a French Apocalypse of the fourteenth
  century, with a text in French prose. The writing is gothic, much changed from the style of the
  thirteenth century, and less regular and elegant. The picture is thoroughly French, of the time
  when English illuminators had yielded up their supremacy to the men of the French school. We see
  the fine outlines and features as we are accustomed to see them in thirteenth century work,
  offering in their delicate style a curious contrast to the broad free paintiness of the
  illustration in plate 12. The Apocalypse, from which the plate is taken, is a French work of the
  middle of the fourteenth century, showing a good deal of the feeling of the preceding century, but
  tending visibly towards the manner of the time when Charles V of France and his brothers were
  associated with manuscripts of an unusually beautiful kind.

  Plate 14 is an example of French grisaille in its earlier stage. The
  four designs look like fine chalk drawings prepared for the use of an engraver, rather than like
  finished illustrations in a book. There is an ease and freedom in the figure-drawing which reveal
  the hand of a true artist, and the treatment of the draperies is excellent; but the landscape
  accessories in the lower two divisions are primitive in their absurdity and childish execution.
  The writing in this example, and in plate 13 also, is typical fourteenth century gothic; small,
  cramped, square, and angular. The border is of the early ivy-leaf pattern, stiff and not natural,
  but not inelegant as decoration. The style and character of  span class="pagenum"
  id="page90">{90}the two plates are essentially French, and could not be found in examples
  of illumination at the period anywhere outside of France.

  Plate 15 introduces us to a totally different kind and style of
  ornament. There is no appearance of stiffness here in the border, with its bold conventional
  foliage of light blue and green, and the long feathery lines that sweep out from it in free and
  graceful curves. The miniature too is full of merit both in design and execution, its only
  drawback being the rather ugly pattern of the green flooring. The seated priest is in the full
  costume of a doctor or literatus of Chaucer's time; and the expression in his features, as well as
  in those of the kneeling Gower, is excellently rendered. The writing here is not the square
  angular gothic of the two preceding plates, but a more rounded script, partaking of the nature of
  the charter hand, which was appropriated to the English language. The a is the only letter in it
  quite identical with that of the fourteenth century gothic, and the p (for th) shows the
  survival of Anglo-Saxon writing, just as the w shows us a modern English letter at a tolerably
  early stage of its growth. The k is likewise noteworthy, as being the peculiar form of the letter
  which had been evolved in the rapid writing of court-scribes, and which is still used in German
  manuscript.

  Plate 16 shows us Franco-Flemish art in a phase in which the simple
  mastery of design had become subordinate to the brilliancy and magnificence of decoration. The
  inner border of interwoven blue and red lines upon a ground of gold is connected with, and grows
  out of, the illuminated initial in a suitably appropriate fashion, but the outer border of
  conventional foliage, red, blue, green, and yellow, with its inserted figures of a kneeling man
  and a hybrid dromedary, has no comprehensible affinity to the rest of the work, and is tacked on
  without any reason beyond the desire for splendour and variety. The style is not distinctively
  Flemish, although the painting was done at {91}Tournay.
  It is rather a development out of Franco-Burgundian models, and more suggestive of French origin
  than any other; in fact, the extension of central French influence northwards through
  Burgundy.

  In plate 17 there is real Flemish work. Here is pure grisaille at its
  best; no infusion of extraneous colour in the design, except in the tesselated pavement of yellow
  and white marble, and no glitter of illumination beyond what is given by a gold crown in the hands
  of one figure, and a couple of gold chains on the breasts of two others. This is indeed a true
  historical picture broadly conceived, well composed, and admirably executed. The perspective is
  excellent, and we realise clearly the size and depth of the large vaulted chamber, lighted only
  from the doorways and the open window-spaces,&mdash;in which the eight personages are grouped. The
  manuscript from which the miniature is taken was written and illustrated, almost undoubtedly, at
  Bruges about 1470 for a nobleman of the Lannoy family, a member not of the principal house which
  still flourished in Flanders, but of the transplanted branch in Picardy.

  Plate 18 is taken from an English manuscript of considerable interest. A
  number of armorial bearings, which are found on the margins of the pages, show that it was written
  either for the Marquis of Dorset, Edward IV's son-in-law, or for one of his children. Whichever
  was the case, the book was in the possession of John Grey, dominus de Blisworth, the son or near
  relative of the Marquis, in the early part of the sixteenth century; and there is a record added
  in the calendar of the death of Dame Elizabeth Grey, this John's wife, about 1520-30. The
  miniatures are good, but not excellent; better in composition than in design, and showing grave
  deficiencies with regard to perspective. They are, however, well executed and well painted; and
  the borders are remarkably elegant. The conventional large foliage, of architectonic character, is
  admirably disposed upon small and appropriate fields of gold; and the twining  span
  class="pagenum" id="page92">{92}branchlets that bear tiny buds and small leaves and flowers
  are not so crowded as to hide the vellum ground. The border is indeed a fine decorative
  composition, without a fault, and thoroughly English in style. There is an inscription at the foot
  of the miniature which inspires curiosity to learn who the writer was. She was evidently a woman
  of high position; for only such a personage would have been allowed to write in a Prayerbook of
  the kind. The words are, "Madame, I pray you remember her that ys yours and evver sall be," but
  the bookbinder has unfortunately cut off the signature. The person addressed was no doubt Dame
  Elizabeth Grey. The writing is strangely like that of Henry VII, but cannot of course have been
  his. It is possibly as late as 1520.

  Plate 22 is from a Prayerbook written and illuminated about 1520-30 for
  a certain Giovanni Bentivoglio. If the book had been a dozen or twenty years earlier than it seems
  to be, one might have supposed that it was executed at Bologna, by the order and for the use of
  the last Bentivoglio who ruled in that city. As, however, he died in exile and misfortune in 1508,
  the Giovanni to whom the prayerbook belonged, must have been his grandson, born about 1510, who
  was in the imperial service in 1530. The artistic merit of the illumination is considerable, but
  they are over-florid and mark a decay of taste. The colours are vivid and harmonious, gold is
  plentifully used, and the beauty of the work is undeniable; but it is meretricious and corrupt in
  style. Italian examples of the period are, however, rare and highly prized.

  On plate 19 we have a large initial (O) cut from an Italian Antiphonal
  or Gradual, written probably about 1540-50. It encloses a miniature representing the Adoration of
  the three Kings, painted with so much skill as to suggest the hand of some student of Titian's
  school. In design, composition, and execution, it is very good; the only drawback being the
  superfine air of courtly elegance {93}which is seen in
  every figure beneath the thatched roof of the stable. There is a theatrical character in the whole
  performance, that reminds us of Federico Baroccio.

  Of similar date is the picture on plate 20. It comes from a
  Gospel-lesson book, written in a mitred abbey on the German side of the Rhine, probably not far
  from Cologne, in the year 1548. The design of the company of monks headed by their Abbot, all in
  white raiment and kneeling before an unseen altar, is excellent German work. The landscape with
  distant towers, seen through the pillars of an arcade behind would look better than it does, if it
  were not for the floating cherubs who hover in the spaces, and support two armorial shields. The
  border is a close imitation of the late Flemish style. On a yellow ground, lighted with twining
  gold branchlets, cut flowers are vividly painted, along with figures of a bee, a fox, a bird, a
  rabbit, and a hybrid animal like an ape.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
