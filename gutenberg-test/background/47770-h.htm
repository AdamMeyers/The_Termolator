<p>The culture and manufacture of Silk, appears
originally to have been confined to the Empire of
China, and even at the present time, no country produces
this useful material in such large quantities, or
of so fine a description. When silk was first brought
into Europe, so little was known of its origin, that
the most absurd tales were told respecting it; by
some it was said to be a kind of fleece, which
adhered to the branches of trees; by others, the bark
of the tree itself, and by another party, the production
of a flower.</p>

<p>The scarcity and consequent value of silk, when
it was first introduced at Rome, may be estimated
by the fact, that more than two hundred years after
that time, the Emperor Aurelian refused his Empress
a garment of this material, on account of its immense
price, twelve ounces of gold being the charge
for one pound of Silk. It was not till the year 552,
that the eggs of the insect, by which the silk is produced,
were brought into Europe. Two monks employed
as missionaries, had succeeded in penetrating
into the Chinese Empire, and having obtained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
thorough knowledge of the whole process of rearing
the silk-worm, and manufacturing the silk, they on
their return, repaired to Constantinople, and gave an
account of their enterprise to the Emperor Justinian.
Induced by the offer of a great reward, they once
more returned to China, and succeeded, after many
efforts, in eluding the vigilance of that suspicious
people, and bringing to Constantinople a number of
the eggs of the silk-worm, concealed in the head of a
walking-cane; these were hatched by the heat of
a hot-bed, and being afterwards carefully fed and
attended to, the experiment, which had cost these
enterprising men so much toil, was perfectly successful,
and the cultivation of the silk-worm became
very general over the whole of Greece. In the year
1146, we still find the management of these useful
creatures, and the manufacture of their spoils, in
Europe, confined to the Greek Empire.</p>

<p>In 947, Roger, the first King of Sicily, invaded
Greece, and having sacked the cities of Athens,
Thebes, and Corinth, led into captivity a considerable
number of silk-weavers, whom he forcibly settled at
Palermo, obliging them to instruct his subjects in
the art, and in twenty years, the Sicilian silks are
said to have attained great excellence, from the variety
of patterns in which they were wrought. The
manufacture of this important article, gradually
spread through the whole of Italy and Spain, but it
was not until the beginning of the sixteenth century,
in the reign of Francis the First, that it was introduced
into France. In 1554, while its manufacture
was yet but little known in England, a curious law
was passed by the tyrannical Mary, for the purpose
of assisting the consumption of home productions,
by which it was enacted, "that whoever shall wear
silk, in or upon his or her hat, bonnet, or girdle,
scabbard, hose, shoes, or spur-leather, shall be imprisoned
during three months, and forfeit ten
pounds," making, however, a few exceptions in favour
of persons of distinction. The manufacture of stockings
from silk, appears about this time to have been
making some progress, although, in this country
at least, they were considered a peculiar rarity, for
that luxurious and expensive Prince, Henry the
Eighth, was obliged to wear cloth hose, except when,
by great chance, he was able to obtain from Spain, a
pair of silk stockings for gala days.</p>

<p>The Broad-Silk manufacture in England, had its
origin in the following occurrence. In the year
1585, the Duke of Parma, governor of the Netherlands,
then in the possession of Spain, having taken
the city of Antwerp, where a large and flourishing
manufactory existed, consigned it during three days,
to unchecked plunder and destruction: the ruin
of this noble city was a death-blow to the commerce
of Flanders, and its flourishing manufactures
were dispersed over different countries. A large
portion of the manufacturers and merchants, employed
in the silk trade, took refuge in England,
where they ultimately settled, and taught the art
they had imported. For many years, however,
foreign goods were preferred to those of English
make, but still improvements were constantly and
steadily taking place, and, at the present time, the
fabrics of this country are fully equal, if not superior
to those of any other nation.</p>

<p>A curious occurrence, showing the perfection to
which the English fabric has arrived, took place in
1824. A French manufacturer came over to England,
and settled in London; a feeling of jealousy
seems to have arisen against him, and it was broadly
hinted that his manufactory was merely a cloak for
the purpose of smuggling French silks. An inquiry
was instituted, and his premises searched, when
thirty-seven pieces of goods were seized, and condemned
as foreign; and it was only after producing
the individuals by whom they had actually been
made, that he was able to remove the impression that
they had been smuggled.</p>

<p>In 1685, the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
and the persecution of the protestants in France,
compelled many merchants, manufacturers and
workmen to take refuge in England. Of these, a
large number who had been employed in the silk
manufacture resorted to Spitalfields, and at the
present time, descendants of these emigrants may be
found on the spot, engaged in the same employment.
About the end of the sixteenth century, the
Rev. William Lea, of St. John's College, Cambridge,
invented a machine for the purpose of knitting
stockings, by which the work was so much improved
that vast quantities were exported, and their being of
English manufacture was considered, in foreign countries,
as a recommendation of their good qualities.
About the same time, Henry the Fourth of France
was making great exertions to extend the cultivation
and manufacture of silk in his empire. To attain
this end, he offered every facility to enterprising men,
and, as an extraordinary inducement, proffered patents
of nobility to such large manufacturers as should
support their establishments successfully for the period
of twelve years. He also extended the cultivation
of the worm over the whole of France; but,
probably on account of the climate, was obliged to
abandon his plans in all but the more southern departments.</p>

<p>The success of the French king caused, at the
time, many attempts to breed the worms to be
made in England, but they all appear to have been
unsuccessful, and the same result attended experiments
made in our American colonies. In the
year 1825, a company was formed, entitled 'the
British, Irish, and Colonial Silk Company;' about
eighty acres of ground were purchased near Michelstown,
in the county of Cork, and the whole were
planted with white mulberry-trees. The rearing of
the worms was confided to an experienced foreigner,
Count Dandolo, but, from some reason or other, the
undertaking was abandoned. The cause of such repeated
failures is not thoroughly understood; the
severity of the climate has been assigned as a reason,
but silk has been successfully produced in some parts
of Prussia, and the climate of Pekin, in China, is
colder than that of Scotland. But whatever success
might attend an experiment of the sort, it is clear
that, in a mercantile point of view, the project would
never succeed, on account of the number of hands
that would be required, and the higher rate of wages.
In several parts of the East Indies, the silk-worm has
been introduced, as might have been expected, with
complete success; and, in Bengal alone, the factories
find employment for upwards of two hundred thousand
persons.</p>

<h3>THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WORM.</h3>

<p>Silk is the production of a species of Moth, called
the <i>Phalæna mori</i> or Mulberry moth, and its original
locality, as we have already stated, appears to have
been China or Persia. The changes that butterflies
or moths undergo, having already been described at
page 212 of Vol. II., it will be needless to repeat
them. The substance which the animal spins to
protect itself when in the Pupa state, is the silk,
which, before it is dyed or bleached, is of a bright
yellow colour more or less inclining to orange. The
Silk-worm in not the only creature that produces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
substances of this description, for many other kinds
of butterflies and moths do the same; a kind of
silk has also been manufactured from the webs of
spiders, and as they require less attention than the
Silk-worms, the plan might have answered, had it
not been for the ravenous appetites of the little
spinners, who, when brought together in any quantity
very speedily devour each other. Certain shell-fish
also produce a kind of silky thread; as, for instance,
the muscle, but more particularly the <i>pinna</i>, a large
kind of shell-fish found in the Mediterranean and
other seas.</p>

<p>The time that elapses while the silk-worm is undergoing
its changes, varies according to the warmth of the
weather, and the quantity of nourishment with which
it is supplied; the Chinese, who are very particular
on this head, take the greatest pains to supply the
little creature with food, as on this they say depends
the quantity of silk which the worm will produce.
They calculate that the same number of insects,
which would, if they had attained their full size, in
from twenty-three to twenty-five days, produce
twenty-five ounces of silk, would only yield twenty
ounces if their growth occupied twenty-eight days,
and only ten ounces if forty days. During the first
twenty-four hours of the creature's existence, the
patient Chinese feeds the objects of his care forty-eight
times, or once every half hour, and during
the second day and night thirty times, and so on,
reducing the number of meals as the worms grow
older; the care bestowed on their culture, and the
numerous precautions taken to preserve them clean
and warm, are curiously expressed in the following
extract from on old Chinese work on the subject.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The place where their habitation is built must be
retired, free from noisome smells, cattle and all
noises; a noisome smell, or the least fright, make
great impressions upon so tender a breed; even the
barking of dogs and the crowing of cocks are capable
of putting them in disorder, when they are newly
hatched.</p>

<p>"For the purpose of paying them every attention,
an affectionate mother is provided for the worms,
who is careful to supply their wants; she is called
<i>Isan-mon</i>, mother of the worms. She takes possession
of the chamber, but not till she has washed
herself and put on clean clothes, which have not the
least ill smell; she must not have eaten any thing
immediately before, or have handled any wild succory,
the smell of which is very prejudicial to these tender
creatures; she must be clothed in a plain habit,
without any lining, that she may be more sensible of
the warmth of the place, and accordingly increase or
lessen the fire, but she must carefully avoid making
a smoke or raising a dust, which would be very
offensive to these tender creatures, which must be
carefully humoured before the first time of casting
their slough. Every day is to them a year, and has
in a manner the four seasons; the morning is the
spring, the middle of the day the summer, the
evening the autumn, and the night the winter."</p></blockquote>

<p>While it remains in the state of a caterpillar, the
Silk-worm changes its coat four times, and previous
to each moult refuses its food, and appears in a
very sickly condition. As soon as its nest or cocoon
is finished, and it has changed into the pupa-state,
the cocoons are carefully removed from the place
where the animal had formed them; and after those
which it is intended to keep, that they may perfect
their changes and lay eggs for the ensuing year, are
removed, the remainder are placed in large vessels,
each covered with a thick blanket; they are then
exposed to heat sufficiently powerful to destroy the
life of the pupæ. This is generally accomplished by
placing the vessels in an oven, heated to about the
same degree as that of a baker after his loaves are
drawn; here they are suffered to remain for about an
hour, they are then withdrawn, but the blanket that
covers them, is not removed for the space of five or
six hours.</p>

<p>The first process in preparing the silk, is winding
it off the cocoons: for this purpose, after the rough
outsides are removed, several handfuls at a time are
thrown into a vessel containing water, and placed
over a gentle fire, the water is then allowed to be
heated to nearly the boiling point; a short stunted
brush formed of heath or any other shrub of that
description, is now gently moved about among the
cocoons, and on withdrawing it from the water, the
ends of the silk are found to have adhered to it in
several places; the winder then gathers together with
her fingers, as many ends as she intends the first description
of thread to consist of, and hands them to
an assistant, whose office it is to turn the reel as soon
as the silk is laid upon it; the principal workwoman,
in the mean time, continually adds to the thread the
ends of fresh cocoons, as soon as the first are
exhausted.</p>

<p>The silk, when reeled off in this manner, is called
<i>singles</i>, and is used in weaving to form the <i>weft</i>, that
is, the thread that crosses the cloth from side to side.
Another description of silk threads, are called trams,
and these consist of two or three <i>singles</i> twisted
together; but the strongest and most valuable sort
is the <i>organzine</i>, which is formed by placing skeins
of <i>singles</i> upon a reel, and as they are wound off, they
are, by the assistance of machinery, strongly twisted.
Two or three of these are then taken, and the whole
again twisted together to form a stronger thread;
this thread is the <i>organzine</i>, and is used for the warp
or length of the cloth.</p>

<p>The process of making organzine, is called <i>throwing</i>,
and the throwsters form a very important branch
of the silk business. Before the year 1719, the whole
of the thrown silk used in England came from
abroad, but at that time Sir Thomas Lombe and his
brother erected a large mill at Derby for the purpose
of forming organzine, and obtained an exclusive
patent for its manufacture, for the term of
fourteen years; at the expiration of that term, they
applied for a renewal of their patent, but it was
refused by Parliament, and the trade has since then
been open to competition. Some idea may be
formed of the extent to which the silk manufacture
is carried on at present in England, by the fact that
no less a quantity than four million, six hundred
and ninety three thousand, five hundred and seventeen
pounds of raw silk were imported for home
consumption, in the year ending January 1831.</p>

<p>The substance on which this valuable caterpillar
feeds, is the leaf of the Mulberry Tree; and Providence
as if to ensure the continuance of this useful
species, has so ordained it, that no other insect will
partake of the same food; thus ensuring a certain
supply for the little spinster.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The engravings which illustrate this article are
copied from original Chinese drawings: the first shows
the apartment in which the worms are fed, and the
manner in which the little trays containing them are
arranged. In the second, the cocoons being completed
by the insect, are being cleared of dirt and
dead leaves, before they are removed from the frames
on which they had spun. The third represents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
winding off the silk into <i>singles</i>, but the windster
appears for the moment to have left her post for the
purpose of blowing the fire. In the fourth engraving,
a Chinese silk-loom, is shown; the figure seated above,
among the machinery, appears to assist the labour by
means of her weight.</p>

<h2>NARRATIVE OF A SAILOR LEFT ON AN
ISLAND IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.</h2>


<p>Early in the year 1825, the subject of this narrative was,
at the age of seventeen, placed on board a ship employed
in the South Sea Fishery. The ship being in the latitude
of the Gallapagos, a group of islands situated about two
hundred miles west of Peru, she directed her course towards
them for the purpose of obtaining wood and water. Here
they found an American brig which had arrived there, a
day or two previous, with the same intention. They came
to an anchor fronting a sandy beach of no very great extent,
with high hills, and lofty woods terminating the prospect;
the inland parts at a little distance seemed impracticable
from the great thickness of the forests. A number of
hands were despatched on shore in the long-boat, but not
meeting with so desirable a place for watering at they expected,
some of the men entered the woods in search of
the "Quick freshes," while others proceeded along shore
to find one less objectionable. Of the former party was
young Lord, who, separating from the rest, entered unconsciously
into the thickest part of the country. Having
wandered on in this wild labyrinth for nearly two hours,
without finding water, or being able to knock down any of
the large birds which he chased from among the wild furze
and thickets, he began to think of returning. Being perfectly
satisfied in his own mind that he was proceeding in
the direction for the ship, he pursued the path he had
chosen; evening, however, began to wrap the forest in a
deeper gloom, and only just sufficient light remained to
show him that he had arrived at a place clothed with some
fine trees, beyond which the woods grew so thick as to
render them impassable. The fact now first flashed upon
him, that he had proceeded in all probability some miles
into the interior, and he cheerfully made up his mind to
pass the night in the woods, not doubting that on the
morrow, he should readily find his way back to the vessel.
In this comfortable hope, after having fortified himself with
a draught of water from a spring, he ascended one of the
trees; and here, notwithstanding the loud screaming of the
nightbird, and the continued whoopings of innumerable
owls, "making night hideous," worn out by fatigue and
watching, he slept till morning.</p>

<p>It may be imagined that at the first glimpse of daybreak,
he was not a little anxious to get out of the wood, for he
now began to suffer severely from want of food. For some
hours he wandered about in the intricacies of this wild and
uninhabited spot, supported in the hope that his toils were
near their termination. Often did he listen in breathless
attention to catch the sound of any signal-gun to guide his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
footsteps, and often did he shout in expectation of being
heard by those who might have been despatched in search
of him. He ascended the high trees, but his view was
constantly intercepted by forests and elevated hills wooded
to their summits. Hunger now forced on him the necessity
of seeking some means of subsistence; he accordingly prepared
with his knife a formidable bludgeon, and scarcely
had an hour passed when, startled by a rustling among
the underwood, he expected some kind of animal to sally
forth, but was surprised to see a large black snake glide
out from its concealment and raise its head, "nimble in
threats," at his approach. Having got within range of his
stick, he immediately "rapped" it "o' the coxcomb,"
whereupon it rolled itself up, and after a few twists and
twirls remained stationary, with its forked tongue thrust out
of its mouth.</p>

<p>In this desolate situation night again overtook him,
and although the climate of the island, notwithstanding
its latitude, is generally mild, and the middle of the day
pleasantly warm, yet the mornings and the evenings are
rather cold; consequently, he had to struggle against both
cold and hunger without any apparent remedy. The simple
circumstance of having met with a snake in the day
did not seem of much consequence, but the idea of meeting
one in the night, occasioned by his hearing those peculiar
noises usually made by them at this period, kept him in
continual anxiety. He ascended a tree, and having eaten
some of the leaves, remained during the obscurity of a
night intensely dark, with his spirits dreadfully depressed,
for he now began to fear that the ship would sail without
him; his situation appeared hopeless, and he passed a
sleepless and desponding night; the noises kept up in
the woods convinced him that many birds of prey existed
upon the island. When day began to appear, he descended
from the tree, and had not gone many paces when he perceived
a large owl perched, with the most imperturbable
gravity, upon a low bough, with its large eyes intently
fixed on him, but as if unconscious of his appearance.
He quietly approached near enough to knock it on the
head, and thus he had the good fortune to provide himself
with a breakfast. Having eaten sufficiently of this carrion,
which left his mouth as bitter as wormwood, he set out
with a determination of moving in a right line, which
could not fail of bringing him to the sea-shore at some part
of the island. Towards evening he was seized with a most
painful sickness, and felt cold and disheartened; he had
not seen during this day any four-footed animal.</p>

<p>The night set in dark and rainy, and he took up his
quarters at the base of a mountain, determined to ascend
to the summit in the morning, in the hope of gaining a
view of the sea; but the first thing he did was to shelter
himself in one of the low trees which had the thickest
foliage, and which proved, in some measure, a defence
against the tempestuous weather which now set in. In this
dismal situation he fell asleep; and on awakening found himself
in a very feeble condition, and completely wet through.
Towards morning the weather cleared up, and he proceeded
with no very great expedition to climb the mountain, for
his strength was nearly exhausted; after great exertion he
succeeded in gaining the top, and with great joy found
that it commanded a view of the anchorage: but he also
made another discovery, which, in its event, threatened to
prove more fatal to this unfortunate youth than all his
former adventures; the ship to which he belonged had put
to sea, and the American brig was at that moment loosening
her sails. The distance from the place where he stood
to the sea-beach, was at least three miles; and the well-known
signal warned him that not a moment was to be
lost. The perfect hopelessness of all succour, should she
sail before he could arrive at the beach, rendered him
desperate; he rushed down the mountain, sick, dizzy, and
faint, his limbs with difficulty performing their office; he
succeeded after nearly two hours of great fatigue and
difficulty in reaching the bay where he first landed; but
what was his horror on beholding the white sails of the
American brig dwindled to a mere speck upon the horizon!</p>

<p>Though naturally of an almost unconquerable spirit,
the hopelessness of his situation overpowered him, and
he fell down in agony upon the sand which he grasped
in agitated spasm. Here he lay until the day was
pretty far advanced. On recovering a little, the want
of food became insupportable; he hobbled along shore
in search of shell-fish, but was obliged to put up with
wild shrubs. He sheltered himself this night in the
woods which skirted the see, and in the morning
returned to the task of procuring subsistence. With this
intent he walked along the beach, and at a rocky part of
the shore he perceived several seals; some of them were
reposing on the sand, while others lay upon the rocks.
Approaching very silently, and selecting one whose head
presented a fair mark, he with a few blows secured the
prize. Being unable to make a fire he proceeded to cut it
up, and selecting a piece of the liver, ate it ravenously;
this he had no sooner done than he was seized with
excessive sickness, and was obliged to lie upon the sand for
a length of time, completely exhausted. Having refreshed
himself with some water, he again pursued his path along
shore, when by great good fortune he fell in with a tortoise;
this he also quickly despatched, and the flesh agreeing
with his stomach renovated his strength; he was soon
afterwards enabled to return to the place where he had
left the seal, which he forthwith cut up into long strips,
and laying them upon the sand, left them to dry, intending
to try another piece for breakfast in the morning, the
remains of the tortoise sufficing only for that evening.</p>

<p>In this manner, he existed for some days, sleeping in the
woods at night, and roving abroad in the day; but the
supply of seals at last failed him, nor could he find another
tortoise, and starvation began once more to stare him in
the face. It happened that the weather was particularly
pleasant, and he often refreshed himself by sleeping on
the warm sand; a gun would have been the means of supplying
him with plenty of water-fowl, and he often had the
vexation of seeing quantities of such birds fly past him
with impunity. One morning when he had wandered some
distance, allaying his appetite with whatever he could find
upon the coast, he sank down beside a small bank quite
exhausted, and fell asleep. On awaking, he found that he
had overlaid a snake; its species was different from the
one he had killed in the woods, and it was not quite dead;
the unexpected occurrence not a little startled him, and,
placing his stick under its speckled belly, he tossed it into
the sea. He had not the good fortune, with all his industry,
to meet with any provision, he therefore crawled
back to the bay. In the morning, which was very serene
and pleasant, he sauntered along, but with the same want
of success as on the foregoing day; nothing could he
find to recruit his strength, which now became seriously
impaired, not only from the deprivation, but the quality, of
the food which he had been obliged to eat. The morning
being very far advanced and the sun pleasantly warm,
he threw himself, or rather fell, down upon the shore,
and obtained in sleep a respite from the pangs of
hunger.</p>

<p>On awaking, he beheld the amphibious and black bullyhead
of a large seal, who, like himself, was basking in the sun
and enjoying a sound sleep; it had taken up its situation,
singular as it may appear, almost within the grasp of our
famished Crusoe. Astonished at the companionable qualities
displayed by his unctuous friend, for "misery acquaints
a man with strange bed-fellows," he raised himself up, and
gazed perfectly panic-struck on the uncouth monster, who
soundly reposed with the utmost tranquillity. From what
has been related, it will be concluded that poor Lord was
not at this time very strong, and unfortunately he had
let fall his club about twenty paces before he sank down
upon the shore, and feared that if he got up to fetch it,
he might disturb his reposing companion. He therefore
determined on commencing an attack with his knife.
He suddenly darted forward, and succeeded in encircling
the seal in his arms and legs, and rolling with the creature
over and over; but the seal was too strong in despite of all
he could effect, and they both rolled into the sea.</p>

<p>Vexed and confounded at the escape of his prey, the
more so when he found his hands much lacerated in the
encounter, he crawled on shore, where he luckily recovered
his knife which he had dropped on the spot where they
floundered. As he did not expect another visit from this
animal, he picked up his club, and began to pursue his
road back, benumbed with cold, and much reduced by the
heavy fatigue of the day; he had not gone half a mile,
when, to his great joy, he beheld a tolerably large tortoise
moving up from the sea towards the woods. Exerting his
utmost strength, he was so successful as to arrive in sufficient
time to intercept its retreat, and he proceeded to despatch
it without delay. This supply came very opportunely,
and after this meal he found himself so much the better,
that he reached the tree, where he put up for the night,
and slept without disturbance. The next morning he
finished the remains of the tortoise, and he then mus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>tered
up resolution to enter the forest, in order to keep a
look-out from the mountain from whence he had beheld
the American ship prepare for sailing. He succeeded in
gaining the summit, and remained all this day viewing the
distant horizon, but no sail appeared, and the night passed
heavily. About the middle of the next day, he was obliged
by hunger to return to the beach, the island being destitute
of berries or fruits.</p>

<p>In this manner he subsisted till the morning of the
twenty-first day, which found him on the top of the mountain,
reduced to the greatest extremity, and more like an
apparition than a human being; "sharp misery had worn
him to the bone," and he expected to die very shortly. As
his eye wandered round the glittering expanse, he thought
he distinguished in the extreme distance a dark speck,
which he took to be a sail. He gazed at it most intensely,
but it did not seem to move, and he concluded it was a
rock; in order to be convinced, he lay down, and brought
the stem of a small tree to bear upon the distant object,
which he now perceived moved along the level horizon. It
must be a ship, but she was passing the island, and he
kept anxiously looking, in the expectation of her fading
from his view. In a short time he could perceive her to be
a vessel of some size, but his heart sank within him when
he observed soon afterwards that she stood away upon a
different tack. In about half an hour she tacked again,
and it now became evident that she was making for the
island. The joy of the poor sufferer at this welcome sight
broke out in sundry raptures and transports. He rushed
down the mountain with such little caution, that he stumbled
over the broken rocks, and pitched headlong down
the broken and rugged descent. After many painful
efforts, he staggered from the woods to the sea-shore, and,
when he beheld the ship come fairly into the bay, and
anchor, a boat hoisted out, and pull with long and rapid
strokes towards him, he fell overpowered upon the sand.</p>

<p>On the boat reaching the shore, the poor fellow appeared
at his last gasp, and all he could articulate was "Water,
water!" One of the sailors brought some in a can, and
suffered him to drink his fill; soon afterwards he again
swooned away, and in this state they carried him alongside,
where he became sensible, but unable to speak or move.
His helpless condition rendered it necessary to hoist him
on board. Nothing could exceed the kind and humane
treatment which he received from Captain Cook, and the
surgeon of the ship, to whose skill and attention may be
attributed his ultimate recovery, as from the quantity of
water the sailor suffered him to drink (which the surgeon
succeeded in dislodging from his stomach,) in his miserable
and emaciated state, the medical gentleman, when he first
saw him, had but faint hopes of his surviving; indeed,
this gentleman declared that he could not have lived upon
the island many hours longer. In a short time, he was
well enough to leave his cot, when he was informed by
Captain Cook, that about a week's sail from the Gallapagos,
he had luckily fallen in with the ship by which Lord had
been left, when the master told him, that a youth had been
missed, and was left upon the island; this induced the
Captain to bear up for the place, otherwise he had no
intention of making it.</p>

<p>This individual was afterwards Master's Assistant on
board his Majesty's ship Druid.</p>

<h2>ON THE SIGNS OF THE SEASONS IN RURAL PURSUITS.</h2>

<p>"Our forefathers probably paid more attention to the
periodical occurrences of Nature, as guides for direction
in their domestic and rural occupations, than we
of the present day are accustomed to do. They seem
to have referred to the Book of Nature more frequently
and regularly than to the almanack. Whether
it were, that the one being always open before them,
was ready for reference, and not the other, certain it
is, that they attended to the <i>signs of the seasons</i>, and
regarded certain natural occurrences as indicating,
and reminding them of, the proper time for commencing
a variety of affairs in common life.</p>

<p>The time was (perhaps it is not yet gone by), when
no good housewife would think of brewing when
the beans were in blossom. The bursting of the
alder-buds, it was believed, announced the period at
which eels begin to stir out of their winter quarters,
and, therefore, marked the season for the miller or
fisherman to put down his traps, to catch them at
the wears and flood-gates. The angler considered
the season at which tench bite most freely to be indicated
by the blooming of the wheat; and when
the mulberry-tree came into leaf, the gardener judged
that he might safely commit his tender exotics to the
open air, without the fear of injury from frosts and
cold. Then there was a variety of old sayings, or
proverbs, in vogue, such as&mdash;</p>

<p>People talked of "the cuckoo having picked up the
dirt," alluding to the clean state of the country at
the time of the arrival of the cuckoo; and of "blackthorn
winds," meaning the bleak north-east winds,
so commonly prevalent in the spring, about the time
of the blowing of the blackthorn. Virgil, in the
recipe he gives in his <i>Georgics</i>, for the production of
a stock of bees, states that the process should be

    </div>

</div>

<p>The intelligent observer of nature, from whose
writings we have been permitted to make some extracts,
has been greatly struck with coincidences of
this kind; and he mentions, with interest, an idea
suggested in the same work, of forming "a calendar,
by which the flowering of a plant should acquaint us
with the appearance of a bird, and the appearance of
an insect tell us the flowering of a plant."</p>

<p>Following up this idea, he annexes a plan of such
a calendar, in which each month, except "dark
December," contains notices of these occurrences in
nature. The grounds for his remarks are extremely
curious, and worthy of our observation. In associating
the wasp with the hawthorn-leaf in April, the
author says, "Wasps seem to delight in frequenting
hawthorn-hedges in the spring, as soon as the
early foliage comes out. What is it that attracts
them to these haunts? Perhaps they come in search
of the larvæ of other insects which feed on the hawthorn.
That wasps, whose ordinary food seems to
be fruit, yet occasionally devour insects, there can be
no doubt, as, even in summer, they may often be
seen to attack and devour the flies in the windows.
When they make their first appearance in spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
there is no fruit for them; therefore they may, at
that season resort to hawthorn-hedges, which abound
with the larvæ of various insects. The song of the
cuckoo is found to occur at the time of the appearance
of the <i>Papilio cardamines</i>, (or orange-tipped
butterfly.) It is a common remark, that the cuckoo
is seldom heard in July, and this <i>papilio</i> is rarely
met with so late. In the end of November, the
little winter-moth <i>(Phalæna brumaria,)</i> is classed with
the late-flowering <i>asters</i>." We add an account of
this insect in the author's own words. "This
modestly-attired little moth is found abundantly
throughout the greater part of the months of November
and December. Its delicate texture, and
weakly form, would seam to mark it as an insect ill
calculated to endure the inclement season appointed
as its proper period of existence. But nature knows
her own business best; and, accordingly, these
slender creatures brave the tempestuous weather
they are doomed to encounter, totally regardless of
the cold, the wet, the winds, and the fogs of November
and December;</p>

<h2>THE GREAT BELL OF MOSCOW.</h2>

<p>In our first volume, (p. 20,) we gave a history of
Bells, with a table of the weights of some of the
most remarkable. The following account of the
<span class="smcap">Great Bell of Moscow</span>, is furnished in compliance
with the request of some of our youthful readers in
the country.</p>

<p>In the churches of Russia in general, the bells
are numerous and of large size. They are hung,
particularly at Moscow, in belfries, or steeples separated
from the churches; they do not swing like our
bells, but are fixed to the beams, and rung by a rope
tied to the clapper and pulled sideways. One of these
bells in the belfry of St. Ivan's Church, at Moscow,
weighs more than fifty-seven tons. It is used only
on important occasions. "When it sounds," says Dr.
Clarke, "a deep and hollow murmur vibrates all over
Moscow, like the fullest and lowest tones of a vast
organ, or the rolling of distant thunder."</p>

<p>"The Great Bell of Moscow, known to be the
largest ever founded, (its weight being upwards of
four hundred and thirty thousand pounds,) is in a
deep pit in the midst of the palace of the Kremlin,
(the central and highest part of the city). It is said
to have fallen, in consequence of a fire, from a beam to
which it was fastened. But this is not the fact. The
bell remains in the same place where it was originally
cast. It never was suspended; the Russians might as
well attempt to suspend a first-rate line-of-battle ship
with all her guns and stores. A fire took place in the
Kremlin, the flames caught the building erected over
the pit where the bell yet remains, in consequence of
which the metal became hot; and water thrown to
extinguish the fire fell upon the bell, causing the fracture
which has taken place. The engraving will
give an accurate view of its present appearance, and
also of the descent into the cave by means of a double ladder.
The entrance is by a trap-door, placed
even with the surface of the earth." Dr. Clarke then
describes his falling into the pit down the stairs, by
which he narrowly escaped with his life. "The bell,"
he continues, "is truly a mountain of metal. It is
said to contain a very large proportion of gold and
silver. While it was in fusion, the nobles and the
people cast in, as votive offerings, their plate and
money. I endeavoured, in vain, to assay a small
part: the natives regard it with superstitious veneration,
and would not allow even a grain to be filed off.
The compound has a white shining appearance, unlike
bell-metal in general, and perhaps its silvery
aspect has strengthened if not excited the conjecture
respecting the costliness of its ingredients.</p>

<p>On festival days, peasants visit the bell as they
would resort to a church; considering it an act of
devotion, and crossing themselves as they descend
and ascend the steps. The bottom of the pit is
covered with water and large pieces of timber; these,
added to the darkness, render it always an unpleasant
and unwholesome place, in addition to the
danger arising from the ladders leading to the bottom."&mdash;(<i>Travels
in Russia, by the late</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Clarke</span>.)</p>

<p>With the assistance of six Russian officers, Dr.
Clarke took the dimensions. He was unable to
measure the base, that being buried in the earth, but
within two feet of its lower extremity, the circumference
was found to be sixty-seven feet four inches.
The perpendicular height, from the top, measures
twenty-one feet four inches and a half. In the
stoutest part, that in which it should have received
the blow of the hammer, its thickness is twenty-three
inches. They were able to ascertain this, by
placing their hands under water where the rent had
taken place; this, is above seven feet high from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
lip of the bell. This bell is supposed by Dr. Clarke
to have been founded in 1653, during the reign of
Alexis, although the Russians for the most part
maintain, probably on account of the female figure
with which it is ornamented, that it was cast during
the reign of their Empress Anne. This great and
powerful princess succeeded Peter the Great on the
throne in 1725.</p>

<h2>ANECDOTE OF THE LATE BENJAMIN WEST, PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL
ACADEMY.</h2>

<p>In the month of June, 1745, one of his sisters, who had
been married some time before, and who had a daughter,
came with her infant to spend a few days at her father's.
When the child was asleep in the cradle, Mrs. West invited
her daughter to gather flowers in the garden, and
committed the infant to the care of Benjamin during their
absence, giving him a fan to flap away the flies from molesting
his little charge. After some time, the child happened
to smile in its sleep, and its beauty attracted his
attention. He looked at it with a pleasure which he had
never before experienced, and observing some paper on a
table, together with pens and red and black ink, he seized
them with agitation, and endeavoured to delineate a portrait;
although at this period he had never seen an engraving
or a picture, and was only in the seventh year of
his age. Hearing the approach of his mother and sister,
he endeavoured to conceal what he had been doing; but
the old lady observing his confusion, inquired what he was
about, and requested him to show her the paper. He
obeyed, entreating her not to be angry. Mrs. West, after
looking some time at the drawing with evident pleasure,
said to her daughter, "I declare, he has made a likeness of
little Sally;" and kissed him with much fondness and
satisfaction. This encouraged him to say, that <i>if it would
give her any pleasure, he would make pictures of the
flowers which she held in her hand;</i> for the instinct of his
genius was now awakened, and he felt that he could imitate
the forms of those things which pleased her sight.
This happened in America, near Springfield in Pennsylvania,
where West was born.&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Galt's</span> <i>Life of West</i>.</p>

1212 London Bridge was nearly consumed by a fire, which broke out at
both ends at the same time. In this conflagration near 3000
persons perished, the sides of the bridge being occupied by rows
of houses, there was, consequently, no escape for the unfortunate
inhabitants, thus hemmed in by the fire on two sides, and the
water behind.

1472 The Town of Beauvais saved from falling into the hands of the
Burgundians by the courage and zeal of the women, who, when the
garrison, exhausted by a long resistance, were on the point of
giving way, came to their assistance, led by one Jeanne de
Hachette. This heroine herself threw down from the walls the
Burgundian officer, who was about to plant his standard on them.
Louis XI. made an honourable marriage for her, and commanded that
the event should be annually commemorated by a procession, in
which the females should walk first; a custom which prevails to
this day.

1559 <i>Henry II. of France</i> died of a wound in the eye, received in a
tournament from the Count de Montgomery. In his last moments the

death should not be molested; but, fifteen years after, he was
arraigned for the fact, and sacrificed to the revengeful feelings
of Catherine de Medicis.

1536 Death of <i>Erasmus</i>.&mdash;He was one of the most learned men of the
extraordinary age in which he flourished. Equally courted by the
Sovereigns of France and England, and by the Popes of the House of
Medici, he could never be induced to abandon the learned pursuits
in which he delighted, for the employments or benefices so
profusely offered to him. The cotemporary of Luther, it has been
said of him, that there was not an error which Luther sought to
reform that Erasmus had not made the subject either of severe
censure or keen satire; yet, restrained by the natural timidity of
his temper, by his love of peace, and hoping that mild measures
would produce a gradual amelioration of the vices he so loudly
censured, he chose rather to assume the character of a mediator
between Luther and the Church of Rome, than openly to join the
party of the reformers. He died at Basle, in the sixty-ninth year of
his age, and was interred in the Cathedral of that town.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
