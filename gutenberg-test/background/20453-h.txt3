The Christmas Child


CHAPTER I

THE COMING OF JOAN



Along some parts of the coast in South Wales the mountains rise abruptly
from the shore, with only a narrow shingle between them and the sea.

High above the coast, however, there are warm, sunny little valleys and
dells among the hills, where sheep can find pasture and a fold; and here
there are many small farmsteads, surrounded by wild rocks and bleak
uplands, where the farmer and his family live with their servants, if
they happen to have any, as they used to do in old times, sitting in the
same kitchen, and taking their meals together as one household.

[Pg 2]Miss Priscilla Parry was the last of three leaseholders of one of these
little farms. Her grandfather had enclosed the meadows and the
corn-fields from the open mountain, on condition that he should have a
lease for three lives from the owner of the land. His own and his son's
had been two of the lives, and Priscilla's was the third.

The farm was poor, for the land was hard to cultivate. In every field
there were places where the rocks pierced through the scanty soil, and
stood out, grey and sharp, amid the grass and the ripening corn. The
salt-laden winds and the fogs from the sea swept over them. Miss
Priscilla spent no money in draining or manuring them; for was not the
lease to pass away when she died, and she was nearly sixty years of age
already?

But the sheep and the cows throve wonderfully on the short, sweet
herbage they browsed on the mountains; and her butter and cheese, and
the[Pg 3] mutton she sold to the butchers, were known through all the
country. Nobody could produce finer. Every one knew she was saving money
up in her little mountain farmstead, and the money was being carefully
laid by for Rhoda Parry, the niece she had adopted in her infancy and
brought up as her own child.



Miss Priscilla was a spare, hard-featured woman, with a weather-stained
face, and hands as horny as a man's with farm-work. Twice a week she
wore a bonnet and shawl, when she went to market or church. All other
times her head was covered by a cotton hood, which could not be damaged
by rain, snow, or wind; and in bad weather she often went about her farm
with an old sack over her shoulders. Her shoes were as thick and as
heavily nailed as old Nathan's, her head servant, and she strode in and
out of her sheds and stables and pigsties as if she had[Pg 4] been a man. It
was said she could get more work done for smaller wages than any farmer
in the country.

There was not a prettier girl in all the parish, which was ten miles
across, than Rhoda Parry, and she was always prettily and daintily
dressed. She had her share of the work to do, but it was the easiest and
most pleasant. If the weather was fine and clear, she might go to call
the cattle home from their cool and breezy pasturage on the mountain
side. The cows she had to milk were the gentle ones, that never kicked.

Aunt Priscilla did the churning of the cream, but Rhoda made the butter
up into pretty golden pats, and wrapped them in cool, dark-green leaves.
Rhoda tended the little flower patches in the garden, whilst her aunt
saw to the vegetables. The light home-work, too, was Rhoda's; but the
rough, laborious scrubbing and washing were[Pg 5] done by her aunt and the
only little maid they kept.

When Rhoda was about eighteen, another niece of Priscilla Parry's died
in London, leaving one little girl quite unprovided for. All the other
relatives decided that, as Priscilla was a single woman doing well in
the world, it was clearly her duty to adopt the child, and without
waiting for her consent, or her refusal, which was the more likely, they
packed off little Joan to her great-aunt's farm.

The child was under six years of age, puny and pale and sickly, having
lived most of her time in a close back room, up three pairs of stairs,
in a London house of business, where her mother had been housekeeper.
Her only playfellow had been a cat, and the prospect from her window had
been the walls of the houses on the opposite side of a narrow court, and
a mere streak of sky above them.[Pg 6]

Miss Priscilla did not at all like to have another child thrown upon
her. Her plans had been laid long ago, and to adopt Joan would quite
upset them. She intended to make Rhoda independent, that she might have
no temptation to marry for a home when her aunt died. Getting married,
to Aunt Priscilla, usually meant the greatest misfortune that could
befall a woman; and to guard Rhoda from it was the fixed purpose of her
life.



Like Queen Elizabeth, she could not forgive anyone belonging to her, man
or woman, who was foolish enough to marry. Her old man-servant, Nathan,
had escaped this error, like herself; and both of them had lived free
and single and wise, as Miss Priscilla Parry often said, even to their
old age. Her cherished day-dream was that Rhoda would follow their
example, and dwell with her in tranquillity and peace, until[Pg 7] she
herself closed her eyes, and fell asleep, in the course of twenty years
or more, leaving Rhoda a staid, discreet, and unmarried woman of middle
age.

Here was another child come, a girl too; and if she grew fond of Joan
she would have the same misfortune to dread for her, and feel the same
desire to save her from it. But she was a proud woman, proud of her
character and name, and she could not turn the desolate child away. She
was in some measure religious too, and if it was God's will, she felt
she must take to Joan. But Aunt Priscilla took to Joan as a cross.

To Rhoda, however, Joan was altogether welcome. She had never had a
playfellow, and Joan was so small and light and delicate that she seemed
almost like a plaything, a living doll. The two were never apart. They
rambled together[Pg 8] about the breezy mountains, catching glimpses of the
blue sea here and there; and they ran down the rough, rocky lane to the
village on the shore, two miles away; and they kept house on
market-days, as if it had been a merry sort of game, when Aunt Priscilla
was away. It was a wonderful change to Joan from her close, dark little
room in London.

The farm-house had been built at different times, and though it
contained no more than four bedrooms, there were three staircases in it,
two of them leading up to single rooms. One of these was set apart for
Joan and Rhoda, where the window looked out upon the small garden and
the green mountain slopes, with the sea and the sky around and above
them.


THE TWO WERE NEVER APART

The farm kitchen, where they chiefly lived, opened into the fold, round
which were built the stables and the cow-sheds, with the barn filling up
one side of it, between them[Pg 9] and the house. In the middle lay a heap
of rotting straw, where the pigs burrowed and the fowls scratched
diligently for hidden food; and all round it ran a causeway of large
round stones, on which the hoofs of the horses rang, and even the soft,
slow tread of the cows could be heard. There was a small blacksmith's
forge at the end of the fold, for old Parry had been something of a
smith himself, and Miss Priscilla could quite well overlook the shoeing
of her horses and the mending of her cart-wheels.

The house-door was always open, and as there was not a morsel of carpet
in the place, not even in the parlour, no one was afraid of dirty
footsteps. There seemed to be something of busy and cheerful work going
on every day, though the place was so far removed from any town or
village.[Pg 10]





CHAPTER II

JOAN'S SEARCH



Miss Priscilla Parry's head servant, old Nathan, took to Joan from the
first. He was a white-headed, strong old man, nearly seventy years of
age, but still able to do a fair day's work, or to take the whole
management of affairs, if Miss Priscilla were laid up, which she never
had been in all her life. He had lived as a boy with her grandfather,
and as a man with her father, and the farm seemed to belong as much to
him as to her. Like most of the people about, he was no Churchman; and
being very ready of speech he was a favourite preacher to the little
congregations meeting in some of the farm-houses scattered about the
mountains.[Pg 11]

Every Sunday evening there was a service held in Priscilla's kitchen,
when twenty or thirty of the neighbours would come in to listen to
Nathan's sermons. Of late years a number of young men, some of whom came
long distances, had been in the habit of attending these Sunday evening
meetings.

Old Nathan liked this very much; but Aunt Priscilla's heart was devoured
by anxiety. Some of the new hearers were neighbours' sons, steady, dull
young farmers, too awkward and shame-faced to push themselves forward;
but there were others, bold young sailors, used to voyaging hither and
thither and to making their own way in strange places, who did not
hesitate to put themselves in the very front, close by the settle where
she sat, and to sing bass to Rhoda's treble, and even to find the text
for her in the Bible. One of them, a notorious young[Pg 12] scamp, Evan Price,
was Aunt Priscilla's greatest plague and aversion; but she never caught
a single word or glance from Rhoda which could show that the girl
encouraged him, or any one among the others; and as long as that was the
case she was willing enough for them to look at her treasure, or long
for it, but she could not bear the idea of losing it.

To little Joan everything was delightful. There had been the hay
harvest, and the corn harvest, and the cutting of fern on the mountains
for winter fodder, and the threshing of the corn on the barn-floor, and
the piling up of great heaps of straw in the wide bays on each side of
the barn.



And now Christmas was coming. Joan had never kept Christmas, and knew
nothing about it. But at Aunt Priscilla's farm it was a great day, as it
always had been since she could remember. Every relative[Pg 13] who could come
to the farm was invited weeks beforehand; and nothing else was talked of
but Christmas Day. The Sunday evening before it came old Nathan's sermon
was all about the shepherds in the field, and how they found the little
babe lying in the manger; and he told the story so well that Joan did
not go to sleep at all, but sat listening to him with her dark eyes wide
open.

"Is it our manger, Rhoda?" she asked, when they went upstairs to their
own little room to bed. "Will the babe be lying in our manger to-morrow
morning?"

"Perhaps," answered Rhoda; "nobody knows whose manger He will come to."

"Oh! I wish it could be ours!" cried Joan eagerly. "I wish Mary and
Joseph 'ud bring the little baby here, and the shepherds 'ud come to
seek for Him. Would n't you love it, Rhoda?"[Pg 14]

"Shall we two get up early, very early in the morning, like the
shepherds did, and go and look in our manger if He 's there?" asked
Rhoda.

"Oh, yes, yes!" answered Joan, almost wild with delight. "Oh! Rhoda,
only suppose the baby should be there!"

Long before old Nathan was stirring, or anyone else in the house was
awake, Rhoda and Joan crept quietly down their own little staircase, and
after lighting the candle in Nathan's great horn lantern, they let down
the bar of the house-door and stepped out into the fold. It was very
dark, but the dim light from the lantern sparkled upon a fine
hoar-frost, which lay like silver on the causeway and glittered on every
straw scattered about the yard. Not a sound was to be heard, except a
very soft, low moan from the sea, and that they listened for as they[Pg 15]
stood still on the doorstep. Joan's heart was beating fast, and her
small fingers clasped Rhoda's hand tightly as they stole along the
causeway to the cow-shed just beyond the barn.



The cow-shed was divided into two, and they passed through the outer
one, where the cows were lying in their stalls, and turned their large,
sleepy eyes upon the two girls, as if to inquire why they were disturbed
so early. In the little shed beyond the fodder and the hay were kept,
and the stalls were empty. The barn opened into it, and the deep black
space under the high roof of the barn served to deepen the delicious awe
in Joan's little heart. Rhoda herself trembled a little with a strange
feeling of seeking something which possibly might be found. She had
never realised so vividly that the Lord Jesus Christ was indeed born in
a stable and cradled in a manger; and she trod[Pg 16] softly, with her heart
beating, like Joan's, faster than usual.

They stood still for a minute on the low door-sill, their lantern
casting its dim rays into the silent shed. Behind them was the deep
breathing of the cows, and the slow sound of their munching, and all
about them was the sweet, familiar scent of the hay. But this silent,
empty spot, half lit up by the lantern, seemed a strange, unfamiliar
place they hardly dared to enter. Rhoda lingered with a vague awe in her
heart, whilst little Joan grasped her hand as if in terror.

"Let us sing 'Hark! the herald angels!'" whispered Rhoda.

Very softly, with a timid and tremulous voice, Rhoda began the hymn, and
little Joan took it up in an undertone. They sang the verses through,
gathering courage as they did so. Then with solemn steps they approached
the manger and raised[Pg 17] the lantern to look into its cradle lined with
hay. It was empty.

"I suppose Mary is gone somewhere else," said little Joan, half grieved;
"it was n't in her way to come here, p'rhaps, or you and me we'd have
been so glad, Rhoda!"

"Perhaps she 'll come next Christmas," answered Rhoda. "We 'll come and
look every Christmas morning, and sing our hymn, and perhaps we shall
find them some time&mdash;Mary, and Joseph, and the babe, wrapped in
swaddling clothes and lying in the manger. Now we'll go back, and wake
up aunty, and tell her all about it."

Aunt Priscilla hardly knew what to think of it. Rhoda had always been
given to "making believe." She had often played at being David killing
Goliath with a smooth pebble from the brook, or Ruth gleaning in the
fields, or the Queen of Sheba, with a crown of cowslips, visiting[Pg 18] King
Solomon. For the last few years these fancies had left her, but they
were all coming back again with little Joan. And going to look for the
child Jesus in the manger; was it right or wrong? She spoke privately to
Nathan, and the old man smiled, though he shook his white head.

"They 'll grow older and wiser in time," he said; "and sure the Lord 'ud
never be angered wi' two young creatures seeking after Him in any way!"

But when the next Christmas came all was changed at the farm-house on
the mountain. There had been no preparations made for keeping it as a
holiday, and no gathering of kinsfolk was invited by Priscilla Parry.
Nathan unbarred the kitchen-door, and lighted little Joan across the
fold; but she went into the stable alone, and stood on the threshold
singing the Christmas[Pg 19] hymn with a sad, pale face that wore a lonely and
frightened expression. The manger was empty, as it had been the year
before; but the home seemed empty too.



All Joan knew of the beginning of this mournful change was, that she
awoke one pleasant sunny morning and found Rhoda gone.

That day Aunt Priscilla roamed about the farmstead and the scattered
fields her grandfather had enclosed upon the mountain, like one
distracted, calling everywhere for Rhoda. The farm-labourers loitered
about the fold and the little blacksmith's shop, whispering mysteriously
whenever Joan had been within hearing. There had been nobody to keep
them to their work, for Nathan was away all day, and did not return till
the late sunset was past and even the loftiest peak of the highest
mountain stood grey and dark against the sky.[Pg 20]

Nobody had bade Joan to go to bed, and she was afraid of her little,
lonely, separate room, if Rhoda was not coming back to sleep with her.
Not a single word had Aunt Priscilla spoken to her all the day, and if
the young servant-girl had not given her some bread and a bowl of milk
she would have been left without food, for Aunt Priscilla had not eaten
a morsel, or sat down in the kitchen, since the early morning.

Joan had curled herself up in a corner of the oak settle, which stood as
a screen on one side of the corner fireplace, and had fallen fast asleep
there, when she was aroused by Nathan's voice. He spoke so quietly and
sadly that it did not quite awake her, and her drowsy ears took in the
sound as if he had been talking to some one a long way off. But suddenly
Aunt Priscilla spoke, in a voice so terrible and loud that she woke up
in a fright. Her aunt was[Pg 21] standing in the middle of the floor, and the
light from a candle fell upon her face, weary and grey, and drawn into a
frown of stern and passionate anger.

"She shall never enter my doors again!" she exclaimed; "neither she nor
her husband, Evan Price&mdash;the worst scamp in the country! I 'll never
forgive her. Deceiving me all these months! Let nobody ever name her
name to me again; she's dead to me for evermore."

"No, no," said old Nathan, sorrowfully; "don't thee harden thy heart
against her, Miss Priscilla. She 's been deceived as well as us, poor,
young, ignorant lass! She does n't know what Evan is yet: a handsome
young raskill, as all the girls make much of. If she repents&mdash;and she
will repent, poor creature&mdash;thou must pardon her."

"Never!" cried Aunt Priscilla, "not on my death-bed!"[Pg 22]

"'Forgive us our sins as we forgive them as sin against us,'" he
answered, in a very mournful and solemn voice.



"I'll never pray that prayer again!" she said fiercely. "I haven't
sinned against the Lord as she's sinned against me. I've never brought
shame and disgrace on Him. The Lord may pardon her, but I can't!"

"Hush!" exclaimed Nathan, "hush! God Himself is hearkening to us. Our
sins against Him are as if we owed Him ten thousand talents; and the
sins of our fellow-creatures against us are no more than a hundred
pence. It is our crucified Lord that says it. Ah! thou knowest it well.
'O thou wicked servant, said the lord in the parable,'I forgave thee all
that debt because thou desiredst me; shouldest not thou also have had
compassion on thy fellow-servant, even as I had pity on[Pg 23] thee? And his
lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay
all that was due unto him. So likewise shall My Heavenly Father do also
unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother his
trespasses.' It's an awful thing when the Heavenly Father delivers a
soul to the tormentors! May God in His infinite mercy deliver thee; only
take heed that thou drive not away His Holy Spirit from thee!"

Aunt Priscilla said no more, but went away upstairs, leaving the kitchen
in utter darkness. Joan trembled from head to foot as she listened to
her heavy tread in the room above. When old Nathan struck a light, her
white, scared little face was the first thing he saw. He sat down on the
settle beside her, and took her tenderly into his arms.

"It's a sad day for thee, too, my little lamb," he said; "thou 's lost[Pg 24]
thy playfellow, and there's hard times before thee."

"Where's Rhoda?" asked Joan, trembling.

"She's been tempted away from us," he said sorrowfully, "by one as
pretends he loves her more than us. But thou must go to bed, my little
lass. See! I'll carry thee upstairs. I'm a poor, rough nurse for thee,
but my room's next to thine, on the other side o' the wall, and thee can
cry to me i' th' night if thou 's frightened. And to-morrow I'll knock a
hole through the wall, so as thou can hear me speak to thee. But there's
no wall between thee and the Lord; He's close beside thee, and thou need
never be affrighted."



But little Joan was frightened, both that night and many another dark
hour, when she felt herself alone in the solitary little room. The
child's life became very hard and desolate. Aunt Priscilla took no[Pg 25]
notice of her beyond providing her with food to eat and clothes to wear.
She did not talk to her, and she never took her on her lap or kissed
her. Sometimes Joan would creep timidly to her side and look up into her
face, but Aunt Priscilla never seemed to see her.

There was nothing for the little girl to do but to wander solitarily
about the fields or sit up in her lonely room with no one to speak to
her for hours together. She was more desolate than she had been in
London; for there her mother had sometimes come up to the attic to play
with her, or to nurse her in her arms for a few minutes. There was no
one to love her now, except old Nathan.

There was a still greater change in Miss Priscilla Parry. The neighbours
said she was gone out of her mind; and it was true that all her nature
seemed turned to hardness and sternness. She was never seen[Pg 26] to smile,
nor did she speak a word that was not absolutely necessary. She gave up
going to church and market, and she refused to see any visitor who came
up to the farm.

On Sunday evening, when the usual meeting was held in her kitchen, and
the curious neighbours came in larger numbers than usual, they no longer
saw her in her old place on the settle, where Rhoda's pretty face had
made so strong a contrast with her aunt's. Miss Priscilla, after Rhoda's
foolish flight, always retreated to her bedroom overhead, in which there
was a small trap-door, made when her mother was bedridden, that she
might hear the prayers and the sermon and the singing in the kitchen
below. It was some weeks before old Nathan, who looked every Sunday if
the trap-door was open, saw that it had been lifted up, and knew his
mistress was listening.[Pg 27]

When Miss Priscilla was downstairs about her work it was a sad sight to
see her. Her grey hair had gone quite white, and her eyes were worn out
with weeping. Her shoulders were bent as if she was always stooping
under a heavy burden, and she seldom lifted her head or looked up from
the ground. Joan often saw her lips moving, though no sound came through
them. Everybody except old Nathan thought she was mad.[Pg 28]





CHAPTER III

THE CHILD IN THE MANGER



The long winter evenings were very dreary when the sun set early and the
rain and the fogs overspread the mountains, and enshrouded the home with
blackness.

Aunt Priscilla used to retire upstairs, where Joan could hear her
sobbing often in the darkness; and the two young servants, the maid and
the ploughboy, as soon as she was safely out of the way, would slink off
out of the kitchen, where their mistress could overhear them.

It was not worth while to light a candle for a little girl like Joan,
and many a long hour she sat alone in the dark chimney-corner with no
light save the dull red glimmer of the embers in the grate, and hearing[Pg 29]
strange, mysterious noises all about her, sounds so low and quiet that
they could only be heard when everything else was perfectly still. And
going to bed was always a terror to her. The little creature could not
put her terror into words; but all day long it was as if some powerful
and pitiless enemy was lying in wait to seize her; and as the hour came
when all the household went to bed, and she was forced to creep up her
separate staircase to her lonely room, the terror reached its utmost
height, and she often sprang into bed dressed, and drew the coverings up
above her head, lest she should see or hear something more horrible than
what she could image to herself.

What Joan would have done without Nathan no one can tell. During the
long winter nights, whenever he was sitting with her by the fireside, he
taught her to read, or read aloud to her out of his Bible, which was[Pg 30]
yellow and worn with much turning over of its leaves. He could sing a
little still, though now his teeth were gone his voice was weak and
quavering; but he made Joan sing with him, and took care to choose such
hymns as his mistress had been taught when she was a child, knowing well
she could not help hearing them through the unceiled rafters overhead.
The newer hymns which Rhoda had often sung with her young, sweet voice,
old Nathan never sung; and Aunt Priscilla, in her dark, desolate room,
would sit still and listen, and think of the days when she was herself a
child, and go to sleep and dream that she was a child again.

The third Christmas Eve came; the second since Rhoda ran away from her
tranquil home and all who loved her truly. Joan had grown into a very
silent, pale, and sad child, seldom laughing, and with no com[Pg 31]panion
save old Nathan and a doll he had bought for her in the market-town,
where he went every week instead of Miss Priscilla. She and Nathan could
not sing, "Hark! the herald angels!" because that was one of Rhoda's
favourite hymns; but as they sat together on the settle very quiet, for
both of them were full of sorrowful thoughts, Joan laid her small
fingers timidly on the old man's hard and horny hand.



"Nathan," she said very softly, lest Aunt Priscilla overhead should hear
her, "can I go to-morrow, like Rhoda and me said we would, and look into
the manger for the child Jesus? I know He can't be there, because I'm a
big girl now. But me and Rhoda said we'd go every Christmas morning very
early; and she 'll be thinking of it to-morrow. I'm sure Rhoda 'ill
remember, and think I'm going to look for Him."

"Ay, ay, Joan," answered the old[Pg 32] man; "I'd never say nay to anything as
is done out o' love. Maybe Rhoda 'ill be thinking of it, and please God
it 'ill do her good. I'll be up early i' th' morning and light the
lantern, and see thee safe across the fold and hearken to thee singing
the 'Heral' angels.'"

There was neither frost nor snow this Christmas. The weather had been as
soft and mild as autumn, and there were still some pale monthly roses
blooming against the southern walls of the farm-house. Old Nathan
lighted Joan across the causeway and put the lantern into her hand when
they reached the door of the outer cow-shed. As she stood alone on the
low threshold of the farther shed, and looked up to the black space
above her, where the bay of the barn opened into it on her left hand,
she felt a little terrified. The light from her dim lantern could not
reach the roof, but she could see the[Pg 33] piled-up straw rising high above
her, and the utter blackness beyond it.

Her own white, melancholy-looking face was lit up by the rays from the
perforated top of the lantern, which swung from her hand as she lingered
on the door-sill gazing forward into the dark shed. The thought of old
Nathan not far away gave her some courage, and, after a timorous pause
of a minute or two, her young, clear, yet tremulous voice began to sing
the Christmas Hymn:&mdash;


Hark! the herald angels sing,
Glory to the new-born King;
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled.


All the other verses seemed to slip suddenly out of Joan's memory. She
heard something stirring in the stall before her, the straw rustled
softly, and there was a faint, slight sound of a gentle breathing. With
her heart beating fast she stole forward on tiptoe to the manger, well[Pg 34]
lined with hay, and lifted up the lantern. It was no longer empty: there
lay a child asleep, a little babe, wrapped in swaddling clothes and
cradled in the manger!



No doubt was there in Joan's little heart, no question as to who the
sleeping child could be. All the little learning she had gained died
away when she saw the child. She had come to seek the babe whose birth
the angels had sung over, and she had found him. Without speech or
motion, scarcely breathing for very joy, she stood gazing at it. The
little head and small face, the tiny hands, filled her soul with awe and
tenderness. Very timidly she touched the soft cheek with the tip of her
finger&mdash;the warm, soft cheek&mdash;and the baby stirred a little. Then Joan,
hanging the lantern to the rack above the manger, knelt down by its side
to watch the quiet slumber of the welcome child.[Pg 35]

Were the angels there, asked Joan of herself, unseen and unheard by her,
singing glory? And oh! where was Mary, His mother? and where could
Joseph be? She must take care of the sleeping baby till they came back;
and surely Aunt Priscilla would consent to have such guests as these in
her house.

But before very long she heard Nathan's voice calling her anxiously. He
wanted his lantern; and his mind was not quite easy as to whether it was
well for Joan to keep up a fancy like this. At the sound the baby
stirred, and its tiny features grew puckered up, as if it was about to
cry. Joan sprang up quickly yet quietly, and appeared in the doorway,
beckoning to old Nathan to keep still.

"Hush! hush!" she cried; "he is here sleeping, and you mustn't wake him.
But I don't know where Mary is or Joseph. There is nobody but[Pg 36] the baby.
Oh, I am so happy! I am so happy!"

"What does Joan mean?" thought Nathan, stepping heavily yet gently on
into the inner shed, which he had filled with provender the day before.
Joan led him to the farther stall, and there, in a warm, soft nest of
hay, well wrapped up and sleeping soundly again, lay the baby. The old
man stood silently gazing at it till the slow tears trickled down his
grey and withered cheeks.

"God help us!" he sobbed at last; "poor little lost babe! Come on
Christmas mornin'! And where's thy poor, sorrowful mother? What can we
do for thee, Joan and me? Nobody to give thee a welcome but an old man
and a little child. But we'll love thee for the dear Lord's sake as sent
thee to us on Christmas mornin'. Ay, and, old as I am, I'll fight thy
battles for thee, poor lamb!"[Pg 37]

Very gently he lifted up the tender little creature, and laid it in
Joan's outstretched arms, which tingled with delight, mingled with fear
lest she should loose her hold of it. A flush of colour had come to her
pale face, and all the sadness had fled from it, and her eyes were
shining with joy. Nathan lighted her steps along the stony causeway,
which she trod with a thrill of anxious care, lest she might slip and
fall with her precious burden. But the house was reached in safety, and
the sleeping child had uttered no cry.



"Lay it warm in thy own bed," said Nathan, "and wrap the blankets about
it, and I'll run and fetch Nurse Williams, that knows how to manage
little babes; and keep it still, Joan, while I'm away, whatever you do.
Don't let thy aunt hear it till I come back."

How long Nathan was away Joan could not tell. She knew nothing of[Pg 38] time
as she knelt by the bedside watching the child sleeping so softly and
soundly, its tiny face growing rosy with warmth. But at last her long
day-dream was broken by the sound of her own name, uttered in so loud
and terrible a voice that she felt as if she could not stir hand or
foot. It was Aunt Priscilla's voice, not far away, nay, at the very foot
of the steep and narrow staircase leading up to her room. Joan's heart
seemed to stand still with terror.

"Joan, bring that child down at once!" were the words that rang in her
ears; "I'll not have it one moment under my roof."

Joan did not answer or move, except to throw her little arms over the
sleeping baby.

"No, no!" she heard old Nathan say; "I've lived here in this place all
my life, with thy grandfather and father and thee, and I've been true
and faithful in my service, and I've[Pg 39] grieved over the poor unhappy
mother of the little babe as if she'd been my own child. And now, if the
baby goes away from out of the house I'll go with it. I'll stay no
longer, not another hour. Thou'rt a hard woman, Priscilla Parry, and God
'll show Himself hard to thee. With the unmerciful He'll show Himself
unmerciful, and with the froward He'll show Himself froward. And oh!
it's a fearful thing to think of an unmerciful and hard God!"

Joan listened in terror to Nathan's strange words, but she did not hear
her aunt's voice making any answer. There was utter silence for a long
minute or two, followed by the sound of slow and dragging footsteps,
which grew fainter and fainter till she could hear them no more. Then
old Nathan came upstairs, and Nurse Williams, whom he had been to
fetch.[Pg 40]





CHAPTER IV

LOST AND FOUND



It was a very happy Christmas Day for Joan, though she never left her
little bedroom. Her delight was in watching the wonderful Christmas
child all day, and in helping to nurse him. Never had she seen anything
so perfectly lovely as his tiny hands and feet, and the little head that
nestled down so peacefully on her arm. A good part of the day she was
left alone with the baby, for Nurse Williams was busy about the house,
where there was a good deal of stir and excitement. The neighbours were
coming in to inquire about the rumours that had reached them, and Nathan
was away, and Miss Priscilla had shut herself up in[Pg 41] her room, taking no
notice whatever of any appeals to her to open the door or to speak.

Happy as it was to Joan, to old Nathan it was the saddest Christmas Day
of his life. He was seeking some trace or tidings of the baby's mother;
and his weary feet, made heavy by his heavy heart, trod many a mile that
short wintry day in quest of her. It could be no one else but Rhoda who
had laid the child in the manger. She had never been heard of since Aunt
Priscilla had answered her first and only letter, asking forgiveness, by
a bitter, stern, and terrible command that she must never show her face
again at home, or dare to ask for any help, whatever misery befell her.

But Nathan's search was all in vain. No one had seen her down in the
village, or in the scattered dwellings far and wide upon the mountains.
But more than one had hinted[Pg 42] to him that there were places, not far
away, where the cliffs overhung the sea; and as he returned sorrowfully
homewards he could hear the sad moaning and sobbing of the sea following
him through the stillness of the night air.



But sad as the day was to Nathan, it was most miserable of all for Aunt
Priscilla. She had shut out the grey light of the wintry sky from her
room, and sat in gloom and cold, doing nothing. But she could not shut
out her thoughts and memories; she could not make her heart be still.
When she heard through the thin walls the faint little cry of the baby,
she fancied it was Rhoda's cry when she lay a helpless little creature
on her lap. Again and again Joan's young voice reached her ears, lulling
the baby to sleep with the old, familiar words of the Christmas Hymn&mdash;


Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled.
[Pg 43]

But there was no peace for her. She paced restlessly up and down her
darkened room, repeating to herself hundreds of times, "God and sinners
reconciled!"

But she could never be reconciled to God, for she had vowed never to be
reconciled to Rhoda, who had sinned against her. She had sworn that
Rhoda should never enter her doors or see her face again. Would God let
her enter into His house, or behold His face? A silent, secret voice
kept whispering in her heart, "So likewise shall My Heavenly Father do
also unto you, if ye from your heart forgive not every one his brother
their trespasses."

Late at night Nathan knocked at her door; but she neither spoke nor
opened it.

"Miss Priscilla," he said, "I can find no sign of her anywhere. She's
gone, poor creature! There's some as fancy she's cast herself away into[Pg 44]
the sea; and maybe that's true. It's borne in on my heart as that's
true; but God knows!"

Aunt Priscilla shuddered. She seemed to see in the darkness a slender,
girlish figure standing on the edge of one of the cliffs, and casting
herself down into the restless tide below. But she did not answer old
Nathan, and he went away with a very troubled heart.

But in a few days a rumour ran all through the country-side that Miss
Priscilla Parry's farmstead was haunted. And what spirit could haunt it
except Rhoda's? The washerwoman, coming to wash at three o'clock in the
morning, had seen a dim shape moving slowly in the black shadow of the
wall, made visible by a faint light from the setting moon. The ploughboy
and Nathan, going out early to work, had heard low, rustling footsteps
in the cow-shed as they opened the door.[Pg 45]

Nurse Williams, who came every night to sleep with the baby, fancied she
was awakened by tappings on the lattice panes of the casement. Even
little Joan could hear Rhoda's sobs and moans, as she lay awake
shivering and trembling in bed, with her arm stretched across the baby
to save it from all harm. Everybody was certain now that Rhoda had
thrown herself from the cliffs into the sea; and though her body had
been drifted away by the currents, her ghost had come back to haunt the
place where she had once been so happy, and where her little baby was
living.


Aunt Priscilla had not left her locked and darkened room since she had
entered it on Christmas morning. No one dared to tell her directly of
Rhoda's spirit having come back to trouble and haunt the quiet
homestead. But she could hear all that went on in the kitchen below;[Pg 46]
and in the daytime the neighbours were glad of any excuse to come to the
haunted house, though after nightfall no one would venture out into the
fold except old Nathan. The rough servant-girl and the ploughboy had
both been to her door, and given her notice that they were going to
leave; but she had not asked them for any reason. The last injury Rhoda
could do to her was to make the house a terror and a talk in the
country.

And now, as she sat alone, brooding over the past, with no work filling
the hard hands which were used to be so busy, she no longer thought of
Rhoda with the bitterness of wrath. She remembered what a young girl she
was, and how full of fancies, which made it easy for people to deceive
her. How terrible must have been the girl's misery before she could
drown herself in the sea! And there was no rest for her[Pg 47] troubled
spirit, even in death! She was not sleeping peacefully in the little
churchyard down by the shore, where all their kinsfolk lay within sound
of the sea by night and day. There was something awful to Aunt Priscilla
in the thought of Rhoda's homeless and restless spirit wandering about
the places where she had been an innocent and a happy child.

Late on New Year's Eve Aunt Priscilla drew aside the curtain which had
hung across her window since Christmas Day, and sat in the darkness
gazing out into the field. In the house all was as silent as the grave,
and out of doors there was the hush of night. A hoar-frost had fallen,
and gave a glimmer of light, even where the shadows fell, when otherwise
it would have been utter blackness. The waning moon hung in the dark
sky, above a bank of thick and gloomy clouds. She could hear the distant
undertone of the[Pg 48] sea, and the murmuring of the many brooks running down
the mountain slopes in the winter, for the cold was not yet sharp enough
to freeze them.

And she could hear a far-off house-dog barking, and the nearer clanking
of the chains by which the cows were fastened to their mangers, and the
loud ticking of the old clock in the kitchen below. It would very soon
be midnight. She felt the chill of the keen air, and she shivered as she
huddled her shawl closer about her; but it was not the cold that made
her lips tremble and her heart throb painfully.

She could fancy&mdash;oh, how easily!&mdash;that she saw Rhoda, as she had often
seen her, tripping along the causeway, with her bonny, merry face, and
her dancing feet. But she knew well it was only a trick her memory was
playing. The fold lay all silent and deserted beneath her watchful eyes,
with every door safely[Pg 49] closed, and the gate at the far end locked.
Everything was precisely the same as usual.



She was almost dozing in her chair, when all at once she felt her flesh
creep, and her heart throb more violently than ever. A black form was
stirring, creeping slowly under the walls of the barn, and seemed to be
holding itself up by the empty spaces where the bricks had been left out
in the building of it. It moved so gradually that it hardly seemed to
come closer to the house; and yet it stole on nearer and nearer, a tall,
thin, creeping shadow in the midnight gloom. To Aunt Priscilla it
appeared to be hours, though it could only have been some minutes,
before the shape reached the house-door, and sunk down out of sight on
the threshold, under the shadow of the little pent-roof over the
doorway. She could no longer see it without opening her window and
stretching[Pg 50] out her head. It was there, just out of sight; and it seemed
more terrifying to her than while she could watch its languid and
ghostlike progress.

She sat motionless, with no power to move. Poor Rhoda! poor little
child, whom she had loved so fondly! Not escaped from her misery, even
though she was dead; but wandering, a lost and restless spirit, about
her old home! A rush of troubled tenderness flooded Aunt Priscilla's
heart.

"God help me!" she breathed half aloud. "I never wished her harm like
this; I'll speak to her; I'll call to her. Perhaps she's something to
say, and can't rest till she's said it. Oh! my poor, poor girl!"

Trembling all over, she unlatched her casement and swung it back on its
rusty hinges, which creaked loudly in the utter stillness. The dark heap
on the threshold stirred a little; and[Pg 51] Aunt Priscilla called to it in a
very low, quivering, and sorrowful voice&mdash;



"Rhoda!"

"Yes, aunty," came the answer, in a tone so hollow and faint that she
could hardly be sure whether it had been spoken, or that she had fancied
it.

"Why do you come to trouble us like this?" asked Aunt Priscilla.

"Baby's here, and you, and Joan," moaned the faint voice again, "and
there's nowhere else in all the world for me."

"Is there anything I can do to give you rest?" asked Aunt Priscilla,
shivering.

"If you'd only forgive me before I die!" answered Rhoda, lifting up a
white, thin face, which could be seen dimly in the gloom.

Aunt Priscilla sunk down on her knees before the open window. Rhoda was
not dead, then! It was[Pg 52] she herself, not her ghost, that was wandering
about the old places, and haunting the home that had once been hers, and
which now sheltered her baby. Where she had been all the week Aunt
Priscilla did not know. But what was she to do with her now? Must she
let her die outside her door on this winter's night?

As she knelt there in silence she heard the clock strike twelve, and the
bells from the little grey belfry of the church on the shore ring
cheerily out into the night. Two years ago she and her neighbours had
watched the Old Year out in the kitchen below; and she could see, as it
were, Rhoda's pretty face again, and Joan's sleepy eyes, as they stood
beside her singing the New Year hymn, as soon as the clock had finished
striking. The familiar verses of the hymn ran through her mind till she
came to the last but one[Pg 53]&mdash;


Oh! that each in the day of His coming may say,
"I have fought my way through,
I have finished the work Thou didst give me to do."


But Aunt Priscilla felt that she had not finished the work the Lord had
given her to do for Rhoda; she had not even begun what He had given her
to do for little Joan. If Rhoda had sinned against her, surely she had
sinned against Christ.

With a heavy sob she rose from her knees and went downstairs. The house
was empty, except that Joan and the baby were sleeping in Rhoda's old
bedroom; for all the rest had gone to keep the watch-night in a chapel
two miles or more away. The house-door was not fastened, and she had
only to lift the latch in order to open it. There was not the slightest
sound from the threshold outside where Rhoda was crouching; no moaning
or sobbing, no movement of any kind. Aunt[Pg 54] Priscilla opened the door
very gently and noiselessly.

"Rhoda!" she said, very pitifully.

But the girl did not answer her. She stooped down and raised her up
against her shoulder. Oh! what a small, light burden she seemed, no
heavier than when she was a young child like Joan. Aunt Priscilla lifted
her quite easily in her arms, and carried her upstairs and laid her on
the bed. Then she struck a light, and, shading it with her hand, looked
down on Rhoda's face, as she had done many a time when she had been a
sleeping child. The face was sharp and thin and death-like; she looked
like one who had perished from hunger and want. Was she really dead?


JOAN SAW HER AUNT STANDING BY HER BEDSIDE

Little Joan was awakened suddenly from a sound sleep, and saw her aunt
standing by her bedside, looking to her dazzled eyes a very image of
terror. The child uttered[Pg 55] a shrill scream, and threw both her arms
round the baby, who was lying on a pillow beside her. She thought Aunt
Priscilla had come, knowing that everybody was gone out, to take away
the Christmas child. She must defend him with all her might.



"Get up, Joan," said Aunt Priscilla. "Rhoda is come home, and you must
bring the little baby to her."

She had not seen the child before; and now she stood looking down on the
small sleeping face with tears streaming from her eyes. She bent over
him and Joan, and kissed them both with a strange solemnity, as if she
was making a vow to God. Then she lighted a candle, and bidding Joan
come as quickly as she could, she went away again; and in a few minutes
Joan followed her, carefully carrying the baby in her arms.

There was a pale, sunken face resting on Aunt Priscilla's pillow,[Pg 56] and
thin, wasted hands lying on the counterpane. The eyelids were fast
closed, and the lips clenched. And yet it was Rhoda's face that Joan
saw, and she called to her loudly and joyfully.

"See, Rhoda," she cried, "I found the little baby in the manger on
Christmas morning!"

But Rhoda neither saw nor heard. Aunt Priscilla took the baby from Joan
and laid it on Rhoda's bosom, and placed her hand tenderly on Rhoda's
head. Then it seemed to her that a flicker of life moved over her set
and death-like face.

"Sing, Joan, sing," said Aunt Priscilla, earnestly; and Joan, with her
hands clasped, and her eyes fastened upon Rhoda's dear face, sang in a
loud, clear voice&mdash;


Hark! the herald angels sing!


As she came to the last line, "God and sinners reconciled," Rhoda's
lips[Pg 57] moved, as if she was repeating the words to herself, and her white
eyelids slowly opened.

"Not to me!" she murmured.

"Oh! yes, yes, my darling!" cried Aunt Priscilla, falling on her
knees&mdash;"you and me are reconciled, and God 'ill be reconciled to us
both. We are both sinners; but He'll forgive both you and me."

"And my baby," whispered Rhoda again, slowly moving one of her wasted
arms to put it round him, and gazing mournfully into her aunt's face.



"I'll take care of him," she answered; "God has sent him and Joan to me,
and I'll take care of them for His sake. I took care of you for my own
sake, Rhoda."

There was a faint smile on Rhoda's face; and her eyelids closed again,
as if she was too weak to keep them open longer. By-and-by there came
into the quiet room the sound[Pg 58] of distant voices, and Aunt Priscilla
crept noiselessly downstairs and across the fold to the gate, to tell
Nathan what had happened and to bring them all into the house quietly.

That New Year's Day was as strangely happy a day to Joan as the
Christmas Day before it had been. She never left the room where Rhoda
was lying; for Rhoda could not bear her to go out of sight, and only
seemed content while she could watch her nursing the baby, in her
old-fashioned, motherly manner. As Joan sat on a low rocking-chair,
lulling him to sleep with snatches of hymns, and soothing him tenderly
if he began to cry, Rhoda's eyes shone with a tender light, though the
tears dimmed them at times. It was a peaceful, tranquil day, with few
words spoken by anyone. Aunt Priscilla's step had never been so quiet,
or her voice so gentle; and she[Pg 59] seemed to Joan to be quite a different
person.

When the short afternoon was over, and Nathan's work was done, he came
upstairs to visit Rhoda. She had been as dear to him as his own child;
and as he took her small, withered hand in his, his dim old eyes grew
dark with tears.

"I saw you every day twice," she said, pausing often for breath; "I was
hiding in the barn. I hid myself on Christmas Eve among the straw&mdash;like
Joan and me used to do for fun&mdash;and I laid the baby asleep in the
manger&mdash;for Joan to find; and I saw her come, and heard her sing&mdash;I was
watching her and you. And after that I couldn't go away; there was
nowhere and nobody to go to; and I stayed hiding in the barn. But I was
very cold and miserable; I was frightened of dying there in the barn.
And in the night I came close to the house&mdash;to look for food[Pg 60]&mdash;and
hearken if I could hear the baby. I'm not frightened or miserable now."

"Never mind the trouble now, Rhoda," said old Nathan. "Your aunt's
forgiven you, and taken you home again; and God, He'll forgive us all,
and take us home again some day. Think o' getting well and strong again,
my poor lass."

"Not me," murmured Rhoda, faintly; "it's best for me to die, I know.
Baby 'll be happier without me. I couldn't play with him and make him
merry. Joan 'ill be as a little mother to him, won't you, Joan? I'm
going to give him to you for your very own."

"For my very own!" repeated Joan, with wondering, wide-open eyes.


NATHAN CAME UPSTAIRS TO VISIT RHODA

"Ay! if aunty will let me," answered Rhoda, smiling; "she 'll love the
baby, I know, now she's reconciled to me. Nathan, she for[Pg 61]gives me,
and God forgives me. I'm not unhappy any more."



"Rhoda, my lass," said old Nathan, "thy aunt 'ill never be happy no
more, if thou dies. She's pardoned thee with all her heart; and thou
must try to live, and pay her back. Tell me where thou 's been all this
long while."

For a few minutes Rhoda lay silent, with a look of pain on her young,
pale face.

"I dare n't ever have spoke to aunty," she murmured at last, "she's so
bitter against marrying. And so I ran away, and we were married at
Bristol; and then we went to London; and Evan deserted me before baby
was born. I couldn't find him again anywhere in London; and it was a
dreadful place to stay in without money, and no home. He hadn't been
good to me for a long while before he left me. I've been a very wicked
girl, but I've been[Pg 62] sorely punished for it, Nathan; and I'd rather die
now, I think, than get well again."

"My poor lass!" answered old Nathan, pitifully, "say, 'Let it be as God
pleases.'"

"Let it be as God pleases!" repeated Rhoda, in her faint, hollow voice.

Never could anyone be better nursed than Rhoda was nursed. Aunt
Priscilla watched over her day and night, hardly taking rest, and
sleeping only a few minutes at a time. No noise was permitted about the
farm that could disturb her; only the old, familiar sounds of cattle
lowing, and sheep bleating, and the cackling of barn-door fowls, which
were as soothing as pleasant music to her ears. Joan and the baby were
always in sight; except when they were sleeping in a little bed on the
floor, near at hand, that she might never feel any fear concerning
them.[Pg 63] Every morsel of food she ate was prepared by Aunt Priscilla
herself, who would not trust even Nurse Williams to do anything for
Rhoda.

For a few days it was very doubtful whether she could recover from the
cold and hunger and weariness she had endured; but by-and-by there came
a slight change, and by the time the spring began there was no longer
any fear of her dying.

But Rhoda was never the same again. Her pretty looks were gone, and so
were her merry ways. She was a quiet and grave woman now; often sad.
Year after year went by, and she heard nothing of the husband who had
deserted her. Her aunt found her more of a companion than she had ever
been before; and they two, with old Nathan, gleaned all the brightness
of their lives from Joan and the baby.

The old farmstead was a happier home for Joan than it had ever been[Pg 64] for
Rhoda. She had few indulgences, but she had the baby, the wonderful
child whom she had found lying in the manger on Christmas Day.
By-and-by, as she grew older, she understood Rhoda's sorrowful story,
and how it was he had been laid there in order that she might find him.
But every Christmas morning she stole early across the fold, and into
the silent and empty shed, as if to seek the Christmas child; and when
the baby was old enough she took him with her, and told him how she had
found him there, and knew he was come to bring


Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled.

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
