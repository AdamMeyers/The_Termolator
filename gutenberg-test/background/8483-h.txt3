MACHINE TOOLS FOR BOILER-MAKERS.

We give this week an engraving of a radial drilling machine
designed especially for the use of boiler-makers, this machine,
together with the plate bending rolls, forming portion of a plant
constructed for Messrs. Beesley and Sons, boiler makers, of
Barrow-in-Furness.

"IMPROVED BOILER PLATERADIAL DRILL.">

IMPROVED BOILER PLATERADIAL DRILL.

This radial drill, which is a tool of substantial proportions,
is adapted not only for ordinary drilling work, but also for
turning the ends of boiler shells, for cutting out of flue holes
tube boring, etc. As will be seen from our engraving, the pillar
which supports the radial arm is mounted on a massive baseplate,
which also carries a circular table 6 ft. in diameter, this table
having a worm-wheel cast on it as shown. This table is driven by a
worm gearing into the wheel just mentioned. On this table boiler
ends up to 8 ft. in diameter can be turned up, the turning tool
being carried by a slide rest, which is mounted on the main
baseplate, as shown, and which is adjustable vertically and
radially.

For cutting out flue holes a steel boring head is employed, this
head having a round end which fits into the center of the table.
When this work is being done the radial arm is brought into the
lowest position. Flue holes 40 in. in diameter can thus be cut
out.

The machine has a 4 in. steel spindle with self-acting variable
feed motion through a range of 10 in., and the radial arm is raised
or lowered by power through a range of 2 ft. 8 in. When the arm is
in its highest position there is room for a piece of work 4 ft.
high between the circular table and the lower end of the spindle.
The circular table serves as a compound table for ordinary work,
and the machine is altogether a very useful one for
boiler-makers.

The plate-bending rolls, which are illustrated on first page,
are 10 ft. long, and are made of wrought iron, the top roll being
12 in. and the two bottom rolls 10 in. in diameter. Each of the
bottom rolls carries at its end a large spur-wheel, these
spur-wheels, which are on opposite sides of the machine, each
gearing into a pinion on a shaft which runs from end to end below
the rolls, and which is itself geared to the shaft carrying the
belt pulleys, as shown. This is a very simple and direct mode of
driving, and avoids the necessity for small wheels on the rolls.
There is no swing frame, but the top roll is arranged to draw
through between the arms of the spur-wheels, a very substantially
framed machine being thus obtained.

IMPROVED BOILER PLATE BENDING ROLLER.

The chief novelty in the machine is the additional roll provided
under the ordinary bottom rolls. This extra roll, which is used for
straightening old plates and for bending small tubes, pipes, etc.,
is made of steel, and is 7 in. in diameter by 5 ft. long. It is
provided with a swing frame at one end to allow of taking-off pipes
when bent, etc., and it is altogether a very useful addition.

The machine we illustrate weighs 11 tons, and is all
self-contained, the standards being mounted on a strong bedplate,
which also carries the bearings for the shaft with fast and loose
pulleys, belt gear, etc. Thus no foundation is
required.--Engineering.




MODERN ORDNANCE.

[Footnote: A paper read Feb. 8, 1882, before the Society of
Arts, London.]

By COLONEL MAITLAND.

A great change has lately been taking place throughout Europe in
the matter of armaments. Artillery knowledge has been advancing "by
leaps and bounds;" and all the chief nations are vying with each
other in the perfection of their mat&eacute;riel of war. As
a readiness to fight is the best insurance for peace, it behooves
us to see from time to time how we stand, and the present moment is
a peculiarly suitable one for taking stock of our powers and
capabilities. I propose, therefore, to give you, this evening, a
brief sketch of the principles of manufacture of modern guns, at
home and abroad, concluding with a few words on their employment
and power.

The introduction of rifled cannon into practical use, about
twenty years ago, caused a complete revolution in the art of
gun-making. Cast iron and bronze were found no longer suitable for
the purpose. Cast iron was too brittle to sustain the pressure of
the powder gas, when its duration was increased by the use of
elongated projectiles; while the softness of bronze was ill adapted
to retain the nicety of form required by accurate rifling.

From among a cloud of proposals, experiments, and inventions,
two great systems at length disentangled themselves. They were the
English construction of built-up wrought iron coils, and the
Prussian construction of solid steel castings.

Wrought-iron, as you are all aware, is nearly pure iron,
containing but a trace of carbon. Steel, as used for guns, contains
from 0.3 to 0.5 per cent of carbon; the larger the quantity of
carbon, the harder the steel. Since the early days of which I am
now speaking, great improvement has taken place in the qualities of
both materials, but more especially in that of steel. Still the
same general characteristics were to be noted, and it may be
broadly stated, that England chose confessedly the weaker material,
as being more under control, cheaper, and safer to intrust with the
lives of men; while Prussia selected the stronger but less
manageable substance, in the hope of improving its uniformity, and
rendering it thoroughly trustworthy. The difference in strength,
when both are sound, is great. Roughly, gun steel is about twice as
strong as wrought iron.

I must now say a few words on the nature of the strains to which
a piece of ordnance is subjected when fired. Gunpowder is commonly
termed an explosive, but this hardly represents its qualities
accurately. With a true explosive, such as gun-cotton, nitro
glycerine and its compounds, detonation and conversion of the whole
into gas are practically instantaneous, whatever the size of the
mass; while, with gunpowder, only the exterior of the grain or lump
burns and gives off gas, so that the larger the grain the slower
the combustion. The products consist of liquids and gases. The gas,
when cooled down to ordinary temperature, occupies about 280 times
the volume of the powder. At the moment of combustion, it is
enormously expanded by heat, and its volume is probably somewhat
about 6,000 times that of the powder. I have here a few specimens
of the powders used for different sizes of guns, rising from the
fine grain of the mountain gun to the large prisms and cylinders
fired in our heavy ordnance. You will readily perceive that, with
the fine-grained powders, the rapid combustion turned the whole
charge into gas before the projectile could move far away from its
seat, setting up a high pressure which acted violently on both gun
and shot, so that a short, sharp strain, approximating to a blow,
had to be guarded against.

With the large slow-bursting powders now used, long heavy shells
move quietly off under the impulse of a gradual evolution of gas,
the presence of which continues to increase till the projectile has
moved a foot or more; then ensues a contest between the increasing
volume of the gas, tending to raise the pressure, and the growing
space behind the advancing shot, tending to relieve it. As
artillery science progresses, so does the duration of this contest
extend further along the bore of the gun toward the great
desideratum, a low maximum pressure long sustained.

When quick burning powder was used for ordnance, the pressures
were short and sharp; the metal in immediate proximity to the
charge was called upon to undergo severe strains, which had
scarcely time to reach the more distant portions of the gun at all;
the exterior was not nearly so much strained as the interior. In
order to obviate this defect, and to bring the exterior of the gun
into play, the system of building up guns of successive tubes was
introduced. These tubes were put one over the other in a state of
tension produced by "shrinkage." This term is applied to the
process of expanding a tube by the application of heat, and in that
condition fitting it over a tube larger than the inner diameter of
the outer tube when cold. When the outer tube cools it contracts on
the inner tube and clutches it fast. The wrought-iron guns of
England have all been put together in this manner.

Prussia at first relied on the superior strength of solid
castings of steel to withstand the explosive strain, but at length
found the necessity for re-enforcing them with hoops of the same
material, shrunk on the body of the piece.

The grand principle of shrinkage enables the gunmaker to bring
into play the strength of the exterior of the gun, even with quick
powders, and to a still greater extent as the duration of the
strain increases with the progress of powder manufacture. Thus,
taking our largest muzzle-loaders designed a few years ago, the
thin steel lining tube, which forms an excellent surface, is
compressed considerably by the wrought-iron breech coil holding it,
which, in its turn, is compressed by the massive exterior coil.
When the gun is fired, the strain is transmitted at once, or nearly
at once, to the breech coil, and thence more slowly to the outer
one. Now, as the duration of the pressure increases, owing to the
use of larger charges of slower burning powder, it is evident that
the more complete and effective will be the transmission of the
strain to the exterior, and, consequently, the further into the
body of the gun, starting from the bore, and traveling outward,
does it become advantageous to employ the stronger material. Hence,
in England, we had reason to congratulate ourselves on the
certainty and cheapness of manufacture of wrought iron coils, as
long as moderate charges of comparatively quick burning powder were
employed, and as long as adherence to a muzzle-loading system
permitted the projectiles to move away at an early period of the
combustion of the charge. Then the pressures, though sharp, were of
short duration, and were not thoroughly transmitted through the
body of the gun, so that the solidity, mass, and compression of the
surrounding coils proved usually sufficient to support the interior
lining. Now that breech-loading and slow powders have been
introduced, these conditions have been changed. The strains, though
less severe, and less tending to explosive rupture, last longer,
and are more fully transmitted through the body of the gun. Sheer
strength of material now tells more, and signs have not been
wanting that coils of wrought iron afford insufficient support to
the lining. It becomes, therefore, advantageous to thicken the
inner tube, and to support it with a steel breech piece. Carrying
this principle further, we shall be led to substitute the stronger
for the weaker metal throughout the piece. This has been done by
the Germans in the first instance, and recently by the French also.
It is probable that we shall follow the same course. When I say
"probable," I intentionally guard myself against uttering a
prediction. It is never safe to prophesy, unless you know, as the
American humorist puts it. And in this case we do not know, for a
very dangerous rival, once defeated, but now full of renewed vigor,
has entered the lists against forged steel as a material for
ordnance. This rival's name is wire. Tempered steel wires
can be made of extraordinary strength. A piece of round section,
only one thirty-fifth of an inch in diameter, will just sustain a
heavy man.

If, now, a steel tube, suitable for the lining of a gun, be
prepared by having wire wound round it very tightly, layer over
layer, it will be compressed as the winding proceeds, and the
tension of the wire will act as shrinkage. You will readily
understand that a gun can be thus formed, having enormous strength
to resist bursting. Unfortunately, the wires have no cohesion with
one another, and the great difficulty with construction of this
kind is to obtain what gun-makers call end strength. It is of but
little use to make your walls strong enough, if the first round
blows the breech out. In the early days of wire this was what
happened, and Mr. Longridge, who invented the system, was compelled
to abandon it.

Lately, methods have been devised in France, by M. Schultz; at
Elswick, by Sir W.G. Armstrong &amp; Co.; and at Woolwich, by
ourselves, for getting end strength with wire guns. They are all in
the experimental stage; they may prove successful; but I prefer not
to prophesy at present.

The diagrams on the wall show the general construction of the
modern German, French, and English heavy breech-loading guns. The
Germans have a tube, a jacket, and hoops. The French, a thick tube
or body, and hoops. The English, a tube, a jacket, and an overcoat,
as it may be called. In each system of construction, the whole of
the wall of the gun comes into play to resist the transverse
bursting strain of the charge.

The longitudinal or end strength varies: thus, in the German
guns, the tube and hoops do nothing--the jacket is considered
sufficient. The French construction relies entirely on the thick
body, while the English method aims at utilizing the whole section
of the gun, both ways. Of course, if the others are strong enough,
there is no particular advantage in this; and it is by no means
improbable that eventually we shall find it cheaper, and equally
good, to substitute hoops for the "overcoat."

I fear I have detained you a long time over construction, but it
is both instructive and interesting to note that certain well
defined points of contact now exist between all the great systems.
Thus, a surface of steel inside the bore is common to all, and the
general use of steel is spreading fast. Shrinkage, again, is now
everywhere employed, and such differences as still exist are
matters rather of detail than of principle, as far as systems of
construction are concerned.

We now come to a part of the question which has long been hotly
debated in this country, and about which an immense quantity of
matter has been both spoken and written on opposite sides--I mean
muzzle loading and breech-loading. The controversy has been a
remarkable one, and, perhaps, the most remarkable part of it has
been the circumstance that while there is now little doubt that the
advocates of breech-loading were on the right side, their reasons
were for the most part fallacious. Thus, they commonly stated that
a gun loaded at the breech could be more rapidly fired than one
loaded at the muzzle. Now, this was certainly not the case, at any
rate, with the comparatively short guns which were made on both
systems a few years ago. The public were acquainted with
breech-loaders only in the form of sporting guns and rifles, and
argued from them. The muzzle-loading thirty eight ton guns were
fired in a casemate at Shoeburyness repeatedly in less than twenty
minutes for ten rounds, with careful aiming. No breech-loader of
corresponding size has, I think, ever beaten that rate. With
field-guns in the open, the No. 1 of the detachment can aim his
muzzle loader while it is being loaded, while he must wait to do so
till loading at the breech is completed. Again, it was freely
stated that, with breech-loaders greater protection was afforded to
the gunners than with the muzzle-loaders. This entirely depends on
how the guns are mounted. If in siege works or en barbette,
it is much easier to load a muzzle loader under cover than a
breech-loader. But I need not traverse the old ground all over
again. It is sufficient for me to say here, that the real cause
which has rendered breech-loading an absolute necessity is the
improvement which has been made in the powder. You witnessed a few
minutes ago the change which took place in the action of fired
gunpowder when the grains were enlarged. You will readily
understand that nearly the whole of a quick burning charge was
converted into gas before the shot had time to start; suppose for
the moment that the combustion was really instantaneous. Then we
have a bore, say sixteen diameters long, with the cartridge
occupying a length of, say, two diameters.

The pressure of the gas causes the shot to move. The greater the
pressure, the greater the impulse given. As the shot advances, the
pressure lessens; and it lessens in proportion to the distance the
shot proceeds. Thus, when the shot has proceeded a distance equal
to the length of the cartridge, the space occupied by the gas is
doubled, and its original pressure is halved. As the shot travels
another cartridge length, the space occupied by the gas is trebled,
and its pressure will be but one-third of the original amount. When
the shot arrives at the muzzle--that is, at eight times the length
of the cartridge from the breech--the pressure will be but one
ninth of that originally set up. Remember, this is on the
supposition that the powder has been entirely converted into gas
before the shot begins to move.

Now, suppose the powder to be of a slow-burning kind, and assume
that only one-third of it has been converted into gas before the
shot starts, then the remaining two-thirds will be giving off
additional gas as the shot travels through the bore. Instead,
therefore, of the pressure falling rapidly, as the shot approaches
the muzzle, the increasing quantity of gas tends to make up for the
increasing space holding it. You will at once perceive that the
slower the combustion of the powder the less difference there will
be in the pressure exerted by the gas at the breech and at the
muzzle, and the greater will be the advantage, in point of
velocity, of lengthening the bore, and so keeping the shot under
the influence of the pressure. Hence, all recent improvement has
tended toward larger charges of slower burning powder, and
increased length of bore. And it is evident that the longer the
bore of the gun, the greater is the convenience of putting the
charge in behind, instead of having to ram it home from the front.
I may here remark, that the increased length of gun necessary to
produce the best effect is causing even those who have possessed
breech-loaders for many years to rearm, just as completely as we
are now beginning to do. All the old short breech loading guns are
becoming obsolete. Another great advantage of breech-loading is the
facility afforded for enlarging the powder chamber of the gun, so
that a comparatively short, thick cartridge may be I employed,
without any definite restriction due to the size of the bore.

There is yet one more point in which breech-loading has recently
been found, in the Royal Gun Factory, to possess a great advantage
over muzzle-loading as regards ballistic effect. With a shot loaded
from the front, it is clear that it must be smaller all over than
the bore, or it would not pass down to its seat. A shot thrust in
from behind, on the contrary, may be furnished with a band or
sheath of comparatively soft metal larger than the bore; the gas
then acting on the base of the projectile, forces the band through
the grooves, sealing the escape, entering the projectile, and, to a
great extent, mitigating the erosion of surface. This is, of
course, universally known. It is also pretty generally known among
artillerists that the effect of the resistance offered by the band
or sheathing on the powder is to cause more complete combustion of
the charge before the shot moves, and therefore to raise the
velocity and the pressure. But I believe it escaped notice, till
observed in May, 1880, in the Royal Gun Factory, that this
circumstance affords a most steady and convenient mode of
regulating the consumption of the charge, so as to obtain the best
results with the powder employed.

Supposing the projectile to start, as in a muzzle loader,
without offering any resistance beyond that due to inertia, it is
necessary to employ a powder which shall burn quickly enough to
give off most of its gas before the shot has proceeded far down the
bore; otherwise the velocity at the muzzle will be low. To control
this comparatively quick burning powder, a large air space is given
to the cartridge, which, therefore, is placed in a chamber
considerably too big for it. Supposing, on the other hand, the
projectile to be furnished with a stout band, giving a high
resistance to initial motion, a much slower powder can be used,
since the combustion proceeds as if in a closed vessel, until
sufficient pressure is developed to overcome the resistance of the
band. This enables us to put a larger quantity of slower burning
powder into the chamber, and in fact to use, instead of a space
filled with air, a space filled with powder giving off gas, which
comes into play as the projectile travels down the bore. Thus,
while not exceeding the intended pressure at the breech, the
pressure toward the muzzle is kept up, and the velocity very
materially increased. Following this principle to this conclusion,
it will be found that the perfect charge for a gun will be one
which exactly fills the chamber, and which is composed of a powder
rather too slow to give the pressure for which the gun is designed,
supposing the shot to move off freely. The powder should be so much
too slow as to require for its full development the holding power
of a band which is just strong enough to give rotation to the
shot.

Having settled that the gun of the future is to be a
breech-loader, we have next to consider what system of closing the
breech is to be adopted.

The German guns are provided with a round backed wedge, which is
pushed in from the side of the breech, and forced firmly home by a
screw provided with handles; the face of the wedge is fitted with
an easily removable flat plate, which abuts against a Broad well
ring, let into a recess in the end of the bore. On firing, the gas
presses the ring firmly against the flat plate, and renders escape
impossible as long as the surfaces remain uninjured. When they
become worn, the ring and plate can be exchanged in a few minutes.
Mr. Vavasseur, of Southwark, constructs his guns on a very similar
plan. In the French guns, and our modern ones, the bore is
continued to the rear extremity of the piece, the breech end
forming an intermittent screw, that is, a screw having the threads
intermittently left and slotted away. The breech block has a
similarly cut screw on it, so that when the slots in the block
correspond with the untouched threads in the gun, the block can be
pushed straight in, and the threads made to engage by part of a
revolution. In the French Marine the escape of gas is stopped very
much as in Krupp's system; a Broadwell ring is let into a recess in
the end of the bore, and a plate on the face of the breech-block
abuts against it.

In the French land service the escape is sealed in quite a
different manner. A stalk passes through the breech-block, its foot
being secured on the exterior. The stalk has a mushroom-shaped head
projecting into the bore. Round the neck of the stalk, just under
the mushroom, is a collar of asbestos, secured in a canvas cover;
when the gun is fired, the gas presses the mushroom against the
asbestos collar, and squeezes it against the walls of the bore. It
is found that this cuts off all escape.

We are at present using the Elswick method, which consists of a
flat-backed cup, abutting against the slightly rounded face of the
breech plug. The lips of the cup rest against a copper ring let in
the walls of the bore. On firing, the gas presses back the cup
against the rounded end of the breech-block, and thus forces the
lips hard against the copper ring.

It is difficult to compare the excellence of these various
systems, so much depends on the care of the gunners, and the nicety
of manufacture. The German and French marine methods permit the
parts to be quickly exchanged when worn, but it is necessary to cut
deeply into the walls of the gun, and to make the wedge, or
breech-screw, considerably larger than the opening into the
chamber.

The Elswick plan is decidedly better in this last respect, but
it requires several hours to extract and renew the copper ring
where worn.

The French land service (De Bange) arrangement requires
no cutting into the gun, and no enlargement of the breech screw
beyond the size of the chamber, while it is renewable in a few
minutes, merely requiring a fresh asbestos pad when worn. As
regards durability, there is probably no great difference. I have
been informed that with a light gun as many as 3,000 rounds have
been fired with one asbestos pad. But usually it may be considered
that a renewal will be required of the wearing surfaces of any
breech-loader after a number of rounds, varying from six or seven
hundred, with a field gun, to a hundred or a hundred and fifty with
a very heavy gun. Full information is wanting on this point.

Having now decided on the material of which the gun is to be
composed, and the manner in which it is to be constructed, and
having, moreover, settled the knotty point of how it is to be
loaded, we come to the general principles on which a gun is
designed. It must not be overlooked that a gun is a machine which
has to perform a certain quantity of work of a certain definite
kind, and, like all other machines, must be formed specially for
its purpose. The motive power is gunpowder, and the article to be
produced is perhaps a hole in an armor-plate, perhaps a breach in a
concealed escarp, or perhaps destructive effect on troops. These
articles are quite distinct, and though all guns are capable of
producing them all to some extent, no gun is capable of producing
more than one in the highest state of excellence.

Thus, for armor piercing, a long pointed bolt, nearly solid, is
required. It must strike with great velocity, and must therefore be
propelled by a very large charge of powder. Hence an armor-piercing
gun should have a large chamber and a comparatively small bore of
great length.

For breaching fortifications, on the other hand, curved fire is
necessary; the escarps of modern fortresses are usually covered
from view by screens of earth or masonry in front, so that the
projectiles must pass over the crest of the screen, and drop
sufficiently to strike the wall about half-way down, that is to
say, at an angle of 15&deg; to 20&deg;. To destroy the wall, shell
containing large bursting charges of powder are found to be
particularly well adapted. Now it is clear that, for a shell to
drop at an angle of 15&deg; or 20&deg; at the end of a moderate
range, the velocity at starting must be low. Hence, for pieces
intended for breaching no enlarged powder chamber is wanted; the
effect on the wall is due to the shell, which must be made of a
shape to hold the most powder for a given weight; and, therefore,
rather short and thick. This gives us a large bore, which need not
be long, as little velocity is required.

For producing destructive effect among troops, a third kind of
projectile is employed. It is called shrapnel, and it consists of a
thin shell, holding a little powder and a large quantity of
bullets. The powder is ignited by a fuse, which is set to act
during flight, or on graze, when the shell is nearing the object.
The explosion bursts the shell open, and liberates the bullets,
which fly forward, actuated by the velocity of the shell at the
moment of bursting. Hence, to render the bullets effective, a
considerable remaining velocity is requisite. The gun must
therefore take a large powder charge, while, as the shell has to
hold as many bullets as possible, the bore must be large enough to
take a short projectile of the given weight. Thus, the proportions
of the shrapnel gun will be intermediate between those of the
armor-piercing gun and the shell gun.

There are certain axioms known from experience, which should be
mentioned here. First, the length of the powder chamber should not
be more than three and a half or four times its diameter, if it can
possibly be avoided, because, with longer charges, the inflamed
powder gas is apt to acquire rapid motion, and to set up violent
local pressures. Next, the strength of a heavy gun, as reckoned on
the principle of all the metal being sound and well in bearing,
should not be less than about four times the strain expected.

Again, though there are several opinions as to the best weight
of shot for armor piercing, in proportion to diameter, yet among
the most advanced gun-makers, there is a growing tendency toward
increased weight. The value of w/d&sup3;, that is, the weight in
pounds divided by the cube of the diameter in inches, as this
question is termed, is in the hands of the Ordnance Committee, and
it is to be confidently hoped that efforts will shortly be made to
arrive at a solution. In the meantime, from about 0.45 to 0.5
appears to be a fairly satisfactory value, and is adopted for the
present.

Lastly, it may be broadly stated, that with suitable powders, a
charge of one-third the weight of the shot demands for most
profitable use a length of bore equal to about twenty-six calibers;
a charge equal to half the weight of the shot should be
accommodated with a bore of about thirty calibers; while a charge
of two-thirds the weight of the shot will be best suited by a bore
thirty-five calibers long. Of course, in each case, greater length
of bore will give increased velocity, but it will be gained at the
expense of additional weight, which can be better utilized
elsewhere in the gun.

The amount of work performed by gunpowder, when exploded in a
gun, is a subject which has engaged a vast quantity of attention,
and some highly ingenious methods of calculating it have been put
forward. Owing, however, to the impossibility of ascertaining how
fast the combustion of large grains and prisms proceeds, a very
considerable amount of experience is required to enable the
gunmaker to apply the necessary corrections to these calculations;
but, on the whole, it may be said that, with a given charge and
weight of shot, the muzzle velocity may now be predicted with some
accuracy.

You now have the chief data on which the designer bases his
proposals, and lays down the dimensions of the gun to suit such
conditions as it may be required to fulfill. In actual practice,
the conditions are almost always complicated, either by necessities
of mounting in particular places, such as turrets and casemates; or
by the advantages attending the interchangeability of stores, or
other circumstances; and it requires great watchfulness to keep
abreast of the ever-growing improvements of the day.

I will now conclude with a few words on the power of heavy guns,
when employed in various ways. The first consideration is accuracy
of fire. No matter how deadly the projectile may be, it is useless
if it does but waste itself on air. Accuracy is of two kinds--true
direction and precision of range. All modern guns are capable of
being made to shoot straight; but their precision of range depends
partly on the successful designing of the gun and ammunition, so as
to give uniform velocities, and partly on the flatness of the
trajectory. The greater the velocity, the lower the trajectory, and
the greater the chance of striking the target. Supposing a heavy
gun to be mounted as in the fortresses round our coasts, and aimed
with due care, the distance of the object being approximately
known, we may fairly expect to strike a target of the size of an
ordinary door about every other shot, at a range of a mile and a
half. Here we have carriages mounted on accurately leveled
platforms; we have men working electric position finders, and the
gunners live on the spot, and know the look of the sea and land
round about.

Now, consider the case of guns mounted in ships. You at once
perceive the difficulties of the shooter. Even supposing the ship
to be one of our magnificent ironclads, solid, steady, yielding
little to the motion of the water, yet she is under steam, the aim
of her guns is altered every moment, some oscillation is
unavoidable, and she can only estimate the range of her adversary.
Great skill is required, and not only required, I am glad to say,
but ready to hand, on the part of the seamen gunners; and low
trajectory guns must be provided to aid their skill.

If we go to unarmored ships of great tonnage and speed, we shall
find these difficulties intensified; and if we pass on to the
little gunboats, advocated in some quarters for attacking ironclads
in a swarm, we shall find that unsteadiness of platform in a
sea-way renders them a helpless and harmless mark for the
comparatively accurate practice of their solitary but stately
foe.

The destructive power of guns is little known to the general
public, and many wild statements are sometimes put forward. Guns
and plates have fought their battle with varying success for many
years. One day the plate resists, another day the gun drives its
bolt through. But it is frequently overlooked that the victory of a
plate is a complete victory. If the shot does not get through, it
does practically nothing. On the other hand, the victory of the gun
is but a partial triumph; it is confined to a small arc. I mean
that, when the plate is struck at an angle exceeding 30&deg; or so,
the shot glances harmlessly off; while, even when perforation is
obtained, it is at the expense of the more deadly qualities of the
projectile, which must be a nearly solid bolt, unable to carry in
with it heavy bursting charges of powder or destructive masses of
balls.

About six years ago, an experiment carried out at Shoeburyness
taught a lesson which seems to be in danger of being forgotten. We
hear sometimes that unarmored vessels are a match for ironclads and
forts; and I will conclude this paper with a short extract from the
official account of the results of firing shrapnel shell at an
unprotected ship's side. I shall say nothing of boilers and
magazines, but shall state simply the damage to guns and
gunners.

A target was built representing the side of a certain class of
unarmored ships of war; behind this target, as on a deck, were
placed some unserviceable guns, mounted on old carriages, and
surrounded by wooden dummies, to represent the men working the
guns. The attacking gun was a twelve-ton nine-inch muzzle-loader,
of the old despised type, and the projectiles were shrapnel shell.
The charges were reduced to represent the striking force at a range
of 500 yards. Two rounds did the following damage inside, besides
tearing and ripping the ship's side in all directions.

1st Gun.--Seven men of detachment killed.

2d Gun.--Carriage destroyed. Six men blown to pieces, all the
remainder of the detachment severely hit.

3d Gun.--No damage to gun or carriage. Five men killed, one
blown to bits, and one wounded in leg.

4th Gun.--Gun dismounted. The whole of the gun detachment blown
to pieces.

That is the amount of destruction achieved in an unarmored ship
by two rounds of shrapnel shell.




OSCILLATING CYLINDER LOCOMOTIVE.

This locomotive is the design of Mr. Henry F. Shaw, of
Boston.

This engine has oscillating cylinders placed between the
driving-wheels. Fig. 2 represents a section of one of these
cylinders, from which it will be seen that each has two pistons and
piston-rods, which are connected directly to the crank-pins. His
invention is described as follows in his specification:

"Midway between each set of wheels, e and f, is located the
oscillating steam-cylinder, g, having its journals, g' and g",
supported in the stationary arm, h, which is secured in a suitable
manner to the frame, c. To each cylinder, g, is secured or cast in
one piece therewith a balanced vibratory beam or truss, i, as
shown. Within the cylinder, g, are two movable pistons, k and k',
Fig. 2, provided with piston-rods, l and l', and cross-heads, m and
m', as shown.

"n n are slides for the cross-head, m, on the insides of one end
of the truss or beam, i, and n' n', are similar slides in the other
end of said truss or beam, for the cross-head, m'. To the
driving-wheel, e, is attached a crank-pin, passing through the
cross-head, m, and to the driver-wheel, f, is attached a similar
crank-pin, F, that passes through the cross-head, m'. o is the
slide-valve within the steam-chest, G, which slide-valve is
operated forward and back by means of the valve-rod, o&sup1;, the
outer end of which is hinged to the upper end of the slotted lever,
o&sup2;, Fig. 1, that is hung at o&sup3;, on the end of the
balanced and vibratory beam of truss, i, as shown. On the crank, F,
is secured an eccentric, that works within the slot of the slotted
lever, o&sup2;, during the revolution of the crank, F, and in this
manner imparts the requisite motion to the slide valve, o, to admit
the steam into the cylinder, g, alternately between the pistons, k
and k', and at the ends of said cylinder, g, so as to alternately
force the pistons, k and k', from and toward each other, and thus,
in combination with the vibratory motion of the truss, i, impart a
rotary motion to the driving-wheels, e and f.

SHAWS OSCILLATING CYLINDER LOCOMOTIVE.

"The steam is admitted to and from the cylinder, g, as follows:
When the pistons, k and k', are at the outer ends of their stroke
the steam enters through the channel, p, back of the piston, k, and
at the same time through the channel, p', back of the piston, k',
and thus causes both pistons to move toward each other, the steam
between them being at the same time exhausted through the channels,
q and q', the former communicating with the exhaust, r, by means of
the space, s, in the valve, o, and the latter communicating with
the exhaust, r', through the channel, s', in the said valve, o. The
steam that passes to the back of the piston, k, comes direct from
the steam-chest, G, through the open end of the channel, p, the
valve, o, being at this time moved to one side to leave the port,
p, open. The steam is admitted to the back end of the piston, k',
from the steam-chest, G, through the channel, s", in the valve, o,
and from thence to the channel, p'. When the pistons, k and k',
have reached their inner positions the live steam is admitted
through the channels, q and q', direct from the steam-chest, G, to
the former, and through the recess, s&sup3;, and channel, s', in
the valve, o, to the latter, the exhaust steam back of the piston,
K, passing out through the channel, p, to the recess, s, in the
valve, o, and thence to the exhaust, r, the exhaust steam back of
the piston, k, passing out through channel, p', and through
channel, s", in the valve, o, and thence to the exhaust, r'.

"The valve-rod, o', is to be connected to a link and reversing
lever as usual, such being, however, omitted in the drawings."

The advantages claimed for it are that "it is composed of very
few parts, and it is very powerful on account of its having a
separate steam actuating piston for each of its driving-wheels. It
has great strength and resistance, owing to the fact that no
pressure is exerted on the journals on which the steam cylinders
oscillate, and all the pressure from the steam pistons is directly
transferred to the crank-pins on the driving-wheels. The engine is
perfectly balanced in any position during the stroke, and it may
therefore be run at a much higher speed than the common engines now
in use."




GAS MOTORS AND PRODUCERS.

By C.W. SIEMENS, London.

The cylinder of the engine--assuming that it has only a
single-acting one, placed with its axis vertical--consists of two
parts; the upper hot part being lined with plumbago, fire-clay, or
other refractory material, and the lower part kept cool by a water
casing. The cylinder has a trunk piston working in the lower part,
and on its upper side a shield that almost fills the hot part of
the cylinder when the piston is at the extreme of its upstroke. The
trunk-rod of the piston passes through a stuffing-box in the
cylinder bottom, and is connected to a crank on the engine-shaft;
and this (unless multiple cylinders are employed) carries a heavy
fly-wheel. From the lower end of the cylinder there is a passage
which, by means of a rotating or reciprocating slide, is
alternately put in communication with inlets for gas and air
(regulated by suitable cocks or valves) and with a strong
receptacle. As the piston, makes its upstroke, air and gas are
drawn into the annular space surrounding its trunk, and the mixed
air and gas are compressed by the downstroke of the piston, and
delivered into the receptacle, in which considerable pressure is
maintained. The receptacle is made of cylindrical form, with a
domed cover of thin sheet metal; so that in case of excessive
internal pressure it can operate as a safety-valve to save the body
of the receptacle from damage. From the upper end of the cylinder
there is a passage that, by means of a rotating or reciprocating
slide, is alternately put in communication with the receptacle and
with a discharge outlet. In this passage are fixed a number of wire
gauze screens or pieces of metal with interstices. These constitute
a regenerator of heat, and also prevent a communication of flame
from the cylinder to the receptacle. In the upper end of the
cylinder or of the piston shield are provided electrodes which give
an electric spark, or a platinum wire which is rendered
incandescent by a current from an inductor or other source of
electricity to ignite the combustible charge of the cylinder. After
the engine has been for some time at work, the heat at the upper
part of the cylinder may suffice for effecting ignition without
provision of other means for this purpose.

In combining such an engine with means for generating the
combustible gas, a gas producer is employed. In this producer a
current of heated air is introduced into the heart of a body of
kindled fuel, and the gases produced--partly by distillation and
partly by imperfect combustion of the fuel--are conveyed to the gas
inlet of the cylinder or pump of the engine. As the gas in leaving
the producer is hot, it is caused to pass through regenerating
apparatus, to which it delivers a large portion of its heat before
it reaches the engine, and the air which supplies the producer is
made to pass through this regenerating apparatus so as to take up
the heat abstracted from the gas.

In the accompanying engravings, Fig. 1 shows a front elevation
(partly in section) of a pair of engines constructed according to
this invention. The lower part, A, of each cylinder is cooled by
water circulating through its casing. The upper part, B, is lined
with refractory material, such as fire-clay. The trunk piston, C,
is made hollow, and formed with a shield covered by refractory
material to protect the packing of the piston and the surface of
the lower part of the cylinder from heat. The pistons of the two
cylinders are connected by rods, D, to opposite cranks on the
shaft, E. This shaft, by means of bevel gear, F, works a revolving
cylindrical valve, G, situated in a casing between the two
cylinders. The lowest part of this casing is supplied with
combustible gas and with air, in proportions capable of being
regulated by stopcocks or valves. The highest part of the casing
communicates with a discharge-pipe; and the middle part of it with
a reservoir which can be cut off from communication by a stopcock,
so that the charge in the reservoir may be retained when the engine
is stopped. The middle space of the hollow valve, G, communicates,
by a number of holes, with the middle space of the slide casing. It
also, by means of a port at its lower part, communicates
alternately with the annular spaces of the two cylinders; this
communication in each case being made when the piston is performing
the latter part of its downstroke. The interior of the slide also,
by means of a second port at its upper part, communicates
alternately with the tops of the two cylinders; this communication
being in each case made while the piston is performing the first
portion of its downstroke. During the upstroke of each piston the
slide, by means of another port, makes communication alternately to
each cylinder from the bottom of the slide casing, and by means of
a fourth port make communication alternately from each cylinder to
the top of the slide casing. In the passage connecting the top of
the slide casing to each cylinder is placed a regenerator,
consisting of a number of perforated metal plates or sheets of wire
gauze.

SIEMENS' GAS PRODUCER AND GAS MOTOR. Fig 1.

In order that gas of poor quality or gas diluted with a large
proportion of air may be utilized, an igniting arrangement is
employed which operates as follows: I is a vessel containing a
supply of hydrocarbon oil, preferably of volatile character. From
this vessel pipes lead to two cocks, one for each cylinder; these
corks being caused to revolve in time with the engine-shaft by a
chain, M, communicating motion from a wheel on the engine shaft to
a chain-wheel of equal size on the spindle of the two cocks. The
plug of each cock has on its side a small hollow, which during one
part of its revolution presents itself under the oil-pipe, and
receives a charge of oil. During another part of its revolution,
which is timed to correspond with the flow of gaseous mixture to
the cylinder, the hollow of the plug presents itself to the bend of
a pipe leading from the top of the cylinder to a port opening into
the cylinder below the regenerator, in which port are situated two
wires of platinum. These wires are connected with the brushes of a
commutator, K, on the engine-shaft, which commutator is in
electrical connection with the poles of a battery, dynamo-electric
machine, or other source of electricity. Instead of two wires to
produce a spark, a single wire may be arranged to become
incandescent at the proper time for ignition.

The operation of the engine is as follows: Each piston as it
ascends draws into the annular space under it a supply of gas and
air in proportion regulated by the cocks or valves, and as it
descends it forces this charge into the interior of the revolving
valve and its casing, and into the reservoir which communicates
therewith. When either piston is at the top of its stroke, the
revolving valve admits to the upper part of the cylinder a supply
of the gaseous mixture from the reservoir and valve casing, and
this passes through the generator. At the same time a portion of
the charge passes by the pipe, and becomes enriched by admixture of
the hydrocarbon oil delivered to it by the cock. The enriched
mixture, in passing the platinum wires, which at that time give an
electrical spark, is ignited, and ignites the charge that is
passing through the regenerator into the cylinder. The mixture thus
ignited expands, and acting on the full area of the piston propels
it downward, the under side of the piston being at that time
subject to pressure only on its annular area. When the piston has
completed its down-stroke the passage is opened to the
discharge-pipe, and the expanded products of combustion then pass
from the cylinder through the regenerator, and are discharged. In
their passage they give out to the regenerator a large portion of
their heat, which the charge entering the cylinder for the next
stroke receives in passing through the regenerator.

"SIEMENS' GAS PRODUCER AND GAS MOTOR. Fig 2.">

SIEMENS' GAS PRODUCER AND GAS MOTOR. Fig 2.

Fig. 2 is a vertical section of a gas producer and scrubber,
which, as stated above, may be employed in combination with engines
such as have been described for supplying them with combustible
gas. The producer is a vessel lined with refractory material. At
the top it has a supply opening covered by a cap, U, having a
flange dipping into a sand joint. At the bottom it has an opening
surrounded by inclined bars, V, which rest upon a water-pipe
perforated with small holes, by which water issues to cool the bars
and generate vapor. This vapor rises along with a limited supply of
air through the incandescent fuel above, and combustible gas is
produced, which collects in the annular space, and is led thence by
a pipe to the scrubber. The scrubber is a vessel containing in its
lower part water, W, supplied by a pipe, and having an overflow. By
means of a perforated deflecting plate the gas is caused to bubble
through the water, whereby it is cleansed and cooled, and it passes
by a pipe, X, to supply the engine. The upper end of the vertical
pipe of the scrubber is made open and covered by a cap sealed in
water while the producer is at work. In starting the producer this
cap is removed and a chimney pipe put in its place, so as to give a
draught for kindling the fuel in the producer. When the fuel is
kindled the chimney is removed and the cap substituted, whereupon
the suction of the engine continues the draught as required.




THE BAZIN SYSTEM OF DREDGING.

By MR. A.A. LANGLEY.

This paper, lately read before the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers, London, is a description of the construction and working
of a dredger on M. Bazin's system, as used by the author for the
past three years in dredging sand and other material in Lowestoft
Harbor. The dredger is represented in its general features on next
page, Fig. 1. The total length of the hull is 60 ft., with 20 ft.
beam. In the after part of the hold is placed a horizontal boiler,
A, which supplies steam to a pair of inverted vertical engines, B.
These engines drive, through belts and overhead pulleys, a
centrifugal pump, C, which discharges into the open trough, H. The
suction pipe, D, of this pump passes through the side of the
dredger, and then forms an elbow bent downward at an angle of 45
deg. To this elbow is attached a flexible pipe, E, 12 in. in
diameter and 25 ft. long, made of India-rubber, with a coil of iron
inside to help it to keep its shape. At the lower end of this pipe
is an elbow-shaped copper nozzle which rests on the bottom, and is
fitted with a grating to prevent stones getting into the pump and
stopping the work. The flexible tube is supported by chains that
pass over the head of a derrick, F, mounted at the stern of the
dredger, and then round the barrel of a steam winch. By this means
the depth of the nozzle is altered, as required to suit the depth
of water.

A man stands at the winch, and lifts or lowers the pipe as is
required, judging by the character of the discharge from the pump.
If the liquid discharged is very dark and thick the nozzle is too
deep in the sand or gravel; if of a light color the pipe must be
lowered. The best proportion of water to sand is 5 to 1. When loose
sand is the only material to be dealt with, it can be easily sucked
up, even if the nozzle is deeply buried; but at other times stones
interfere with the work, and the man in charge of the flexible tube
has to be very careful as to the depth to which the nozzle may be
buried in the sand. The pump is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The fan is
2 ft. diameter, and has only two blades, a larger number being less
efficient. The faces of the blades, where they come in contact with
the sand, are covered with flaps of India-rubber. Small doors are
provided at the side of the pump for cleaning it out, extracting
stones, etc. The fan makes 350 revolutions per minute, and at that
speed is capable of raising 400 tons of sand, gravel, and stones
per hour, but the average in actual work may be taken at 200 tons
per hour. This is with a 10-horse power engine, and working in a
depth of water varying from 7 ft. to 25 ft. The great advantage of
this dredger is its capability of working in disturbed water, where
the frames of a bucket dredger would be injured by the rise and
fall of the vessel.

"images/5a_th.jpg" alt="THE BRAZIN SYSTEMEM OF DREDGING.">


THE BRAZIN SYSTEMEM OF DREDGING.

Thus at Lowestoft bucket dredgers are used inside the harbor,
and the Bazin dredger at the entrance, where there are sand and
gravel, and where the water is more disturbed. The dredger does not
succeed very well in soft silt, because, owing to its slow
precipitation, it runs over the sides of the hopper barges without
settling. Nor does it do for dredging solid clay. It gives,
however, excellent results with sand and gravel, and for this work
is much superior to the bucket dredger. The experience in working
was then described, showing that a great many very discouraging
failures preceded successful working, about a year being expended
in getting good results.

COST OF WORKING.

The vessel or barge for carrying the machinery and pumps cost
&pound;600, and the contract price of the machinery and pumps was
&pound;1,200. But before the dredger was taken over by the company
the alterations before enumerated had cost about &pound;300,
bringing the total for barge and dredger up to &pound;2,100. In
building a second dredger this might of course be greatly reduced.
The cost of repairs for one month's working has been only &pound;5.
The contractor receives for labor alone 1-1/8d. per ton, being at
the rate of about 1&frac34;d. for the dredging and 3/8d. for taking
to sea--a lead of two miles--all materials being supplied to him.
The consumption of coal is at the rate of about 1 ton for 1,000
tons of sand dredged. At Lowestoft Harbor the total amount of
dredging has been about 200,000 tons yearly, but this is now much
reduced in consequence of the pier extension recently constructed
by the author, which now prevents the sand and shingle from the sea
blocking the mouth of the harbor. The total cost of working has
been 2.572d. per ton. which with 10 per cent interest on capital,
0.240d., makes the total cost per ton 2.812d. The repairs to steam
tug, hopper, barges, and dredger have averaged about 2d. per
ton.

Before the discussion on the paper commenced, Mr. Langley
remarked that attempts had been made to connect the engine direct
to the pump of a Bazin dredger, but this arrangement failed, and
the belt acted as a safety arrangement and prevented breakage by
slipping when the pump was choked in any way. A new lock was
constructed near Lowestoft a short time ago, and the dredger pump
was used to empty it; when half empty the men placed a net in front
of the delivery pipe and caught a cartload of fish, many of which
where uninjured. In the discussion Mr. Wallick, who had
superintended the use of the dredger at Lowenstoft, gave some of
his experience there, and repeated the information and opinions
given by Mr. Langley in the paper.

Mr. Ball, London agent for M. Bazin, said that as devised by M.
Bazin the pump was placed below water level, so that the head of
water outside should be utilized; but he--Mr. Ball--now placed the
pump considerably above water level, as no specially formed craft
was thus necessary. He also described some of the steps by which he
had arrived at the present arrangements of the whole plant, and
gave some particulars of its working. Mr. Crampton asked some
questions, in reply to which Mr. Ball said the longest distance
they had carried the material was 1,200 yards in two
relays--namely, a second pump on a floating barge with special
engine. The distance to which they could carry the material
depended upon its character. Fine sand would travel well; mud would
not, bowlders would not, though gravel would. To give the water a
rotary motion he had inserted a helical piece of angle iron, and so
prevented deposition.




DANGER FROM LIGHTNING IN BLASTING.

Although the accident in the tunnel in process of construction
at Union Hill by the New York, Ontario, and Western Railroad
Company, which took place on Tuesday afternoon, was happily
attended with no loss of life or serious injuries to the men
employed in the shaft, it reads a new lesson as to the firing of
charges of powder by electricity, and one that should be carefully
noted by railway and civil engineers, and even by the torpedo
service of the United States. The exact cause of the explosion has
scarcely been fully and accurately set forth by the various reports
of the affair.

It appears that the wires usually employed lo supply the
electric lamps in the excavation were used for the purpose of
firing the charges, being disconnected from the electric light
system for the moment and connected with the explosives. As a rule,
six charges were fired together, those of the afternoon relay of
men being exploded at very regular hours--the last usually at 5:45
P.M. There were only sixteen men in the shaft, and the work of
connecting the wires had commenced, when the flash of lightning
that occurred at 5:42 P.M., suddenly charged the conductors and
produced the explosion.

There were two flashes of lightning between the hours of 5 and 6
o'clock Tuesday afternoon, the first taking place at 5:23, and the
second nineteen minutes later. The former, according to testimony
elicited by our reporter, simply caused a slight perturbation of
the lights in the tunnel, but did not extinguish them. Five minutes
later the work of disconnection and reconnection began, but only
two of the six charges were ready for the pressure of the button
when the last flash interrupted the proceedings. The fact that the
time of the explosion corresponded to the second with that of the
aerial electrical discharge furnishes indubitable evidence that the
accident was not caused by any carelessness on the part the
electrician in charge, and exonerates all parties from blame. At
the same time it should be remembered by engineers in of such work
that atmospheric electricity cannot be altogether disregarded in
such cases, and that as a source of accident it may at any time
prove dangerous. The concurrence of circumstances on Tuesday was
particularly fortunate. In the first instance only two of the six
charges had been connected with the firing battery, and in the
second the rock in which the charges were inserted was so
peculiarly soft and porous as to deaden the force of the eight
pounds of giant powder thus prematurely set off. Had the cartridges
been set in the harder and more solid rock of the east heading,
instead of the west, and the explosion taken place there, probably
not a man in the shaft would have escaped destruction. The lesson
to engineers is one of no less importance than if the whole number
of men had been killed, and should lead to the exercise of great
care and precaution at times when the air is charged with
electrical energy.--New York Times.




CAST IRON IN ARCHITECTURE.

Whatever may be the misgivings entertained by many engineers
respecting the future use of cast iron for structures of certain
kinds, it is clear that for architectural purposes this material is
likely to be employed to an extent hardly contemplated by many who
have looked upon it with disfavor. At the present moment many
buildings may be seen in London, in which cast iron has been
introduced instead of stone for architectural features, and the
substitution of cast iron for fa&ccedil;ades in many warehouses and
commercial buildings seems to show that, notwithstanding the
prejudices of the English architect against the importation of the
iron architecture of our transatlantic brethren, there is a
prospect of its being largely employed for frontages in which ample
lighting and strength are needed. The extensive window space
necessary in narrow city thoroughfares, and the difficulty of
employing brick in large masses, such as pilasters and lintels,
have chiefly led to the adoption of material having less of the
uncertain durability and strength of either stone or terra-cotta in
its favor. Architects would gladly resort to the last-named
material if it could be procured in sufficient size and mass
without the difficulties attendant upon shrinkage in the burning,
and the winding and unevenness of the lines thereby caused. They
have also an even more tractable material in concrete ready to
their hand, if they would seriously bring themselves to the task of
stamping an expressive art upon it, instead of going on designing
concrete houses as if they were stone ones. Cast iron has the
advantage of being a tried material; it is well adapted for
structures not liable to sudden weights or to vibration, and so it
has come to be used for features of an architectural kind, by a
sort of tacit acknowledgment in its favor. Those who are desirous
of seeing examples of its employment in fronts of warehouses will
find instances in Queen Victoria Street, Southwark Street, and
Bridge Road, and Theobalds Road, where the whole or portions of
fronts have been constructed of cast iron. At some corner premises
in Southwark, the piers as well as the windows are formed of cast
iron, the former being made to assume the appearance of projecting
pilasters. There is nothing to which the most captious critic could
object in the treatment adopted here; the pilasters and other
features have plain moulded members, and there is no principle of
design in cast work which has been violated--the only question
being the purely aesthetic one--is it justifiable to copy features
in cast iron which have generally been constructed in stone or
marble? The answer is obvious: Certainly not, when those features
suggest the mass and proportions or treatment proper only for stone
or marble; but when they do not so represent the material, it is
quite optional for the architect to build up his front with
castings, if by so doing he can obtain greater rigidity of bearing,
strength, and durability. He ought, of course, to vary the
proportions of his pilasters and horizontal lintels, and make them
more in accord with the material. It is the wholesale reproduction
of the more costly and ornamental features, such as we see in many
buildings of New York and Philadelphia, where whole fronts are
manufactured of cast iron and sheet-metal, which has shocked the
minds of architects of culture and sensitive feeling. Such
imitations and cheap displays outrage the artist by the attempt to
produce in cast or rolled metal what properly belongs to a stone
front.

Bearing this distinction in mind, we are not presuming too much
to assert that architects have in cast iron, when properly employed
under certain restrictions, a material which might be turned to
account in narrow fronts where the use of brick or stone piers
would encroach too much upon the space for light. For warehouse
fronts, we have evidence for thinking that the employment of iron
might be attended with advantage, especially in combination with
brickwork for the main vertical piers. Plain classic mouldings,
capitals and bases of the Doric or Tuscan order, are well suited
for cast-iron supports to lintels or girders. In one attempt to
make use of the structural features of the latter, the fronts of
the girders between the piers are divided into panels, the flanges
and stiffening pieces to the webs forming an effective framework
for cast or applied ornament to be introduced. The iron framework
thus constructed lends itself to the minor divisions of the window
openings, which can be of wood. In the new Leaden Hall and
Metropolitan Fruit and Vegetable Markets, cast-iron fronts have
been largely employed, consisting of stanchions cast in the form of
pilasters, with horizontal connections and other architectural
members.

Regarding the more constructive aspects of cast iron, the
employment of it in fronts having numerous points of support and
small bearings is clearly within the capabilities of the material.
So long as it is used in positions in which its resistance to
compression is the chief office it has to fulfill, cast iron is in
its right place. In the fronts of buildings, therefore, where it is
made to carry the floors and rolled joists, and the lintels of
openings, either as piers, pilasters, or simply as mullions of
windows, it is strictly within its legitimate functions. So with
regard to lintels and heads of openings where short spans exist,
cast iron is free from the objection that can be urged against it
for long girders. In fact, no position is better fitted for a
brittle, granular material than that of a vertical framework to
receive windows and ornamentation, and for such purposes cast iron
is, to our minds, admirably suited.

For bridge-building the value of this metal has lately been much
disputed, though we have several notable examples of its use in the
earlier days for such structures. In fact, the use of cast iron for
structural purposes is not older than the time of Smeaton, who in
1755 employed it for mill construction, and about the same time the
great Coalbrookdale Viaduct was erected across the Severn near
Broseley, which gave an impetus to the use of cast iron for bridge
construction. The viaduct had a span of 100 feet, and was composed
of ribs cast in two pieces; it was erected from castings designed
by Mr. Pritchard, of Shrewsbury, an architect, and this
circumstance is worthy of note as showing that an architect really
was the first to employ this material for important structural
work, and that the same profession was the first to reject it upon
traditional grounds. It is quite certain, however, the
bridge-builder lost no time in trying his hand upon so tractable a
material; for not long after Telford erected a bridge at Buildwas
of even a greater span, and the famous cast-iron bridge over the
river Wear at Sunderland was erected from the designs of Thomas
Paine, the author of the "Age of Reason." Iron bridges quickly
followed upon these early experiments, for we hear of several being
built on the arched system, and large cotton-mills being erected
upon fireproof principles at the commencement of the present
century, the iron girders and columns of one mill being designed by
Boulton and Watt. A little later, Eaton Hodgkinson proved by
experiments the uncertainty of cast iron with regard to tensile
strength, which he showed to be much less than had been stated by
Tredgold. Cast iron was afterwards largely adopted by engineers.
The experiments of Hodgkinson supplied a safe foundation of facts
to work upon, and cast iron has ever since retained its hold.
Thomas Paine's celebrated bridge at Sunderland had a span of 236
feet and a rise of 34 feet, and was constructed of six ribs, and is
remarkable from the fact that the arched girder principle used in
the Coalbrookdale and Buildwas bridges was rejected, that the ribs
were composed of segments or voussoirs, each made up of 125 parts,
thus treating the material in the manner of stone. Each voussoir
was a cast-iron framed piece two feet long and five feet in depth,
and these were bolted together. The Southwark bridge over the
Thames, by Sir John Rennie, followed, in which a similar principle
of construction is adopted. There is much to be said in favor of a
system which puts each rib under compression in the manner of a
stone arch, and which builds up a rib from a number of small
pieces. At least, it is a system based on the legitimate use of
cast iron for constructive purposes. The large segmental castings
used in the Pimlico bridge, and the new bridge over the Trent at
Nottingham, from Mr. M. O. Tarbotton's design, are excellent
examples of the arched girder system. The Nottingham bridge has
each rib made up of three I-shaped segments bolted together and
united transversely; the span is 100 feet in each of the three
openings, and the ribs are three feet deep at the springing,
diminishing about six inches at the crown. We have yet to learn why
engineers have abandoned the arched bridge for the wrought iron
girder system, except that the latter is considered more
economical, and better fitted for bearing tensile stress. Cast-iron
bridges constructed as rigid arches, subject to compression and
composed of small parts, have all the mechanical advantages of
stone without some of its drawbacks, while artistically they can be
made satisfactory erections.--Building News.




SIR W. PALLISER.

We announce with regret the death of Major Sir William Palliser,
which took place suddenly on February 4, 1882. Sir William had been
suffering from disease of the heart for a considerable period, but
we believe that no one anticipated that the end was so near. For
some twenty years Sir William had devoted himself to the
improvement of guns, projectiles, and armor. To him is attributed
the invention of the chilled-headed projectiles which are known by
his name. There seems to be no doubt that chilled projectiles were
suggested at Woolwich Arsenal, and even made, before Sir William
took the matter up, but there is excellent reason to believe that
Sir William knew nothing of this, and that the invention was
original with him; at all events, he, aided by the efforts of the
foundry and the laboratory at Woolwich, brought these projectiles
to perfection, and unless steel-faced armor defeat them they cannot
be said to have as yet met their match. A most valuable invention
of the deceased officer was the cut-down screw bolt for securing
armor plates to ships and ports. It was at one time feared that no
fastening could be got for armor plates, as on the impact of a shot
the heads or the nuts always flew off the bolts. The fracture
usually took place just at the point where the screw-thread
terminated. Sir William adopted the bold course of actually
weakening the bolt in the middle of its length by turning it down,
so that the screw stands raised up instead of being cut into the
bolt, and by this simple device he changed the whole face of
affairs, and the expedient applied in other ways, such as by
drilling holes longitudinally down bolts, has since been
extensively adopted where great immunity from fracture is
required.

It is, however, for the well-known converted gun that Sir
William Palliser's name will be best remembered. When our
smooth-bore cast iron guns became obsolete they were converted into
the rifled compound guns by a process which led to their being
known as Palliser guns. The plan was to bore out a cast iron gun
and then to insert a wrought iron rifled barrel consisting of two
tubes of coiled iron one inside the other. By the firing of a proof
charge the wrought iron barrel was tightened inside the cast iron
casing. By this means we obtained a converted gun at one-third of
the cost of a new gun, and saved &pound;140 on a 64-pounder and
&pound;210 on an 80-pounder. The process of conversion involved no
change in the external shape of the gun, and it could, therefore,
be replaced upon the carriage and platform to which it formerly
belonged. The converted guns were placed upon wooden frigates and
corvettes and upon the land fronts of fortifications, and were
adopted for the defense of harbors. The many services Sir William
Palliser had rendered to the science of artillery secured him the
Companionship of the Bath in 1868, and knighthood in 1873. In 1874
he received a formal acknowledgment from the Lords of the Admiralty
of the efficiency of his armor bolts for ironclad ships. His guns
have been largely made in America and elsewhere abroad; and in 1875
he received from the King of Italy the Cross of Commander of the
Crown of Italy. The youngest son of Lieutenant Colonel Wray
Palliser--Waterford Militia--he was born in Dublin in 1830, and was
therefore only fifty-two years of age. He was educated successively
at Rugby, at Trinity College, Dublin, and at Trinity Hall,
Cambridge, and, finally passing through the Staff College at
Sandhurst, he entered the Rifle Brigade in 1855, and was
transferred to the Eighteenth Hussars in 1858. He remained in the
service to the end of 1871, when he retired by the sale of his
commission. At the general election of 1880, Sir William Palliser
was returned as a Conservative at the head of the poll for Taunton.
In the House of Commons Sir William gave his chief attention to the
scientific matters on which his authority was so generally
recognized. Under the many disappointments and "unkind cuts," which
fall to the lot of the most successful inventors, Sir William
Palliser displayed qualities that won hearty admiration. The
confidence with which he left his last well-known experiment to be
carried out in his own absence almost under the directions of those
whose professional opinions were adverse to his own, may be called
chivalrous. His liberality and kindness of Colonel of the second
Middlesex Artillery Volunteers had gained him the affection of the
entire corps; in short, where it might naturally be expected that
he should win respect, he won the love of those who were thrown
with him.--The Engineer.


THE CEDARS OF LEBANON.--Regulations were lately issued by Rustem
Pasha for the guidance of travelers and others visiting the Cedars
of Lebanon. These venerable trees have now been fenced in, but,
with certain restrictions, they will continue to be accessible to
all who wish to inspect them. In future no encampments will be
permitted within the enclosure, except in the part marked out for
that purpose by the keeper, nor may any cooking or camp fires be
lighted near the trees.




ON THE MECHANICAL PRODUCTION OF ELECTRIC CURRENTS.

The object of these articles is to lay down in the simplest and
most intelligible way the principles which are concerned in the
mechanical production of electric currents. Every one knows now
that electric lights are produced from powerful currents of
electricity generated in a machine containing magnets and coils of
wire, and driven by a steam engine, or gas engine, or water-wheel.
But of the thousands who have heard that a steam engine can thus
provide us with electric currents, how many are there who
comprehend the action of the generator or dynamo-electric machine?
How many, of engineers even, can explain where the electricity
comes from, or how the mechanical power is converted into
electrical energy, or what the magnetism of the iron magnets has to
do with it all? Take any one of the dynamo-electric machines of the
present date--the Siemens, the Gramme, the Brush, or the Edison
machine--of each of these there exist descriptions excellent in
their way, and sufficient for men already versed in the
technicalities of electric science. But to those who have not
served an apprenticeship to the technicalities--to all but
professed electricians--the action of these machines is almost an
unknown mystery. As, however, an understanding of the how and the
why of the dynamo-electric machine or generator is the very A B C
of electrical engineering, an exposition of the fundamental
principles of the mechanical production of electric currents
demands an important place in the current science of the day. It
will be our endeavor to expound these principles in the plainest
terms, while at the same time sacrificing nothing in point of
scientific accuracy or of essential detail.

The modern dynamo-electric machine or generator may be regarded
as a combination of iron bars and copper wires, certain parts of
the machinery being fixed, while other parts are driven round by
the application of mechanical forces. How the movement of copper
wires and iron bars in this peculiar arrangement can generate
electric currents is the point which we are proposing to make
clear. Friction has nothing to do with the matter. The
old-fashioned spark-producing "electrical machine" of our youthful
days, in which a glass cylinder or disk was rotated by a handle
while a rubber of silk pressed against it, has nothing in common
with the dynamo-electric generator, except that in both something
turns upon an axis as a grindstone or the barrel of a barrel-organ
may do. In the modern "dynamo" we cannot help having friction at
the bearings and contact pieces, it is true, but there should be no
other friction. The moving coils of wire or "armatures" should
rotate freely without touching the iron pole-pieces of the fixed
portion of the machine. In fact friction would be fatal to the
action of the "dynamo." How then does it act? We will proceed to
explain without further delay. There are, however, three
fundamental principles to be borne in mind if we would follow the
explanation clearly from step to step, and these three principles
must be laid down at the very outset.

1. The first principle is that the existence of the energy of
electric currents, and also the energy of magnetic attractions,
must be sought for not so much in the wire that carries the
current, or in the bar of steel or iron that we call a
magnet, as in the space that surrounds the wire or the
bar.

2. The second fundamental principle is that the electric current
is, in one sense, quite as much a magnetic fact as an
electrical fact; and that the wire which carries a current through
it has magnetic properties (so long as the current flows) and can
attract bits of iron to itself as a steel magnet does.

3. The third principle to be borne in mind is that to do work of
any kind, whether mechanical or electrical, requires the
expenditure of energy to a certain amount. The steam engine cannot
work without its coal, nor the laborer without his food; nor will a
flame go on burning without its fuel of some kind or other. Neither
can an electric current go on flowing, nor an electric light keep
on shedding forth its beams, without a constant supply of energy
from some source or other.



Fig. 1.

The last of these three principles, involving the relation of
electric currents to the work they can do and to the energy
expended in their production, will be treated of separately and
later. Meantime we resume the task of showing how such currents can
be produced mechanically, and how magnetism comes in in the
process.



Fig. 2

Surrounding every magnet there is a "field" or region in which
the magnetic forces act. Any small magnet, such for example as a
compass needle, when brought into this field of force, exhibits a
tendency to set itself in a certain direction. It turns so as to
point with its north pole toward the south pole of the magnet, and
with its south pole toward the north pole of the magnet; or if it
cannot do both these things at once, it takes up an intermediate
position under the joint action of the separate forces and sets in
along a certain line. Such lines of force run through the magnetic
"field" from one pole of the magnet to the other in curves. If we
define a line of force as being the line along which a free
north-seeking magnetic pole would be urged, then these lines will
run from the north pole of the magnet round to the south pole, and
pass through the substance of the magnet itself. In Fig. 1 a rough
sketch is given of the lines of magnetic force as they emerge from
the poles of a bar magnet in tufts. The arrow heads show the
direction in which a free north pole would move. These lines of
forces are no fiction of the imagination, like the lines of
latitude and longitude on the globe; they exist and can be rendered
visible by the simplest of expedients. When iron filings are
sprinkled upon a card or a sheet of glass below which a magnet is
placed, the filings set themselves--especially if aided by a gentle
tap--along the lines of force. Fig. 2 is a reproduction from nature
of this very experiment, and surpasses any attempt to draw the
lines of force artificially. It is impossible to magnetize a magnet
without also in this fashion magnetizing the space surrounding the
magnet; and the space thus filled with the lines of force possesses
properties which ordinary unmagnetic space does not possess. These
lines give us definite information about the magnetic condition of
the space where they are. Their direction shows us the direction of
the magnetic forces, and their density shows us the strength of the
magnetic forces; for where the force is strongest there we have the
lines of force most numerous and most strongly delineated in the
scattered filings. To complete this first consideration of the
magnetic field surrounding a magnet, we will take a look at Fig. 3,
which reproduces the lines of filings as they settle in the field
of force opposite the end of a bar magnet. The repulsion of the
north pole of the magnet upon the north poles of other magnets
would be, of course, in lines diverging radially from the magnet
pole.



Fig. 3

We will next consider the space surrounding a wire through which
a current of electricity is flowing. This wire has magnetic
properties so long as the current continues, and will, like a
magnet, act on a compass needle. But the needle never tries to
point toward the wire; its tendency is always to set itself
broadside to the current and at right angles to it. The "field" of
a current flowing up a straight wire is, in fact, not unlike the
sketch shown in Fig. 4, where instead of tufted groups we have a
sort of magnetic whirl to represent the lines of force. The lines
of force of the galvanic field are, indeed, circles or curves which
inclose the conducting wire, and their number is proportional to
the strength of the current. In the figure, where the current is
supposed to be flowing up the wire (shown by the dark arrows), the
little arrows show the direction in which a free north pole would
be urged round the wire;[1] a south pole would, of course, be urged
round the wire in the contrary direction. Now, though when we look
at the telegraph wires, or at any wire carrying a current of
electricity, we cannot see these whirls of magnetic force in
the surrounding space, there is no doubt that they exist there, and
that a great part of the energy spent in starting an electric
current is spent in producing these magnetic whirls in the
surrounding space. There is, however, one way of showing the
existence of these lines of force; similar, indeed, to that adopted
for showing the lines of force in the field surrounding a magnet.
Pass the conducting wire up through a hole in a card or a plate of
glass, as shown in Fig. 5, and sprinkle filings over the surface.
They will, when the glass is gently tapped, arrange themselves in
concentric circles, the smallest and innermost being the best
defined because the magnetic force is strongest there. Fig 6 is an
actual reproduction of the circular lines produced in this fashion
by iron filings in the field of force surrounding an electric
current.

[Footnote 1: It will not be out of place here to recall Ampere's
ingenious rule for remembering the direction in which a current
urges the pole of a magnetic needle. "Suppose a man swimming in the
wire with the current, and that he turns so as to face the needle,
then the north pole of the needle will be deflected toward his left
hand."]



Fig. 4

This experimental evidence must suffice to establish two of the
three fundamental points stated at the outset, for they prove
conclusively that the electric current may be treated as a magnetic
phenomenon, and that both in the case of the pole of a magnet, and
in that of the wire which carries a current, a portion, at any
rate, of the energy of the magnetic forces exists outside the
magnet or the current, and must be sought in the surrounding
space.



Fig. 5



Fig. 6

Having grasped these two points, the next step in our argument
is to establish the relation between the current and the magnet,
and to show how one may produce the other.



Fig. 7

If we wind a piece of copper wire into a helix or spiral, as in
Fig. 7, and pass a current of electricity through it, the magnetic
whirls in the surrounding space are modified, and the lines of
force are no longer small circles wrapping round the conducting
wire. For now the lines of force of adjacent strands of the coil
merge into one another, and run continuously through the helix from
one end to the other. Compare this figure with Fig. 1, and the
similarity in the arrangement of the lines of force is obvious. The
front end of the helix acts, in fact, like the north pole of a
magnet, and the further end like the south pole. If a small bar of
iron be now pushed into the interior of this helix, the lines of
force will run through it and magnetize it, converting it into an
electro-magnet. The magnetic "field" of such an
electro-magnet is shown in Fig. 8, which is reproduced from the
actual figure made by iron filings. To magnetize the iron bar of
the electro-magnet as strongly as possible the wire should be
coiled many times round, and the current should be as strong as
possible. This mode of making an iron rod or bar into a powerful
magnet is adopted in every dynamo-electric machine. For, as will be
presently explained, very powerful magnets are required, and these
magnets are most effectively made by sending the electric currents
through spiral coils of wire wound (as in Fig. 8) round the bars
that are to be made into magnets.



Fig. 8

The reader will at this point probably be ready to jump to the
conclusion that magnets and currents are alike surrounded by a sort
of magnetic atmosphere, and such a view may help those to whom the
subject is fresh to realize how such actions as we have been
describing can be communicated from one magnet to another, or from
a current to a magnet. Nevertheless such a conclusion would be both
premature and inaccurate. Even in the most perfect vacuum these
actions still go on, and the lines of force can still be traced. It
is probably more correct to conclude that these magnetic actions
are propagated through space not by special magnetic atmospheres,
but by there being movements and pressures and tensions in the
ether which is believed to pervade all space as a very thin
medium more attenuated than the lightest gas, and which when
subjected to electro-magnetic forces assumes a peculiar state, and
gives rise to the actions which have been detailed in the preceding
paragraphs.



Fig. 9.

The next point to be studied is the magnetic property of a
single loop of the wire through which an electric current flows.
Fig. 9 represents a single voltaic cell containing the usual plates
of zinc and copper dipping into acid to generate a current in the
old-fashioned way. This current flows from the zinc plate through
the liquid to the copper plate, and from thence it flows round the
wire ring or circuit back to the zinc plate. Here the lines of
magnetic force in the surrounding space are no longer only whirls
like those drawn in Fig. 4 and 6, for they react on one another and
become nearly parallel where they pass through the middle of the
ring. The thick arrows show the direction of the electric current,
the fine arrows are the lines of magnetic force, and show the paths
along which a free north pole would be urged. All the front face,
where the arrow-heads are, will be like the north pole of a magnet.
All the other face of the ring will be like the south pole of a
magnet. Our ring resembles a flat magnet, one face all north pole
the other face all south pole. Such a magnet is sometimes called a
"magnetic shell."[1]

[Footnote 1: The rule for telling which face of the magnetic
shell (or of the loop circuit) is north and which south in its
magnetic properties is the following: If as you look at the circuit
the current is flowing in the same apparent direction as the hands
of a clock move, then the face you are looking at is a south pole.
If the current flows the opposite way round to the hands of a
clock, then it is the north pole face that you are looking at.]

Since the circuit through which the current is flowing has these
magnetic properties, it can attract other magnets or repel them
according to circumstances.

"Fig. 10.">

Fig. 10.

If a magnet be placed near the circuit, so that its north pole,
N, is opposite that side of the circuit which acts as a south pole,
the magnet and the circuit will attract one another. The lines of
force that radiate from the end of the magnet, curve round and
coalesce with some of those of the circuit. It was shown by the
late Professor Clerk-Maxwell, that every portion of a circuit is
acted upon by a force urging it in such a direction as to make it
inclose within its embrace the greatest possible number of lines of
force. This proposition, which has been termed "Maxwell's Rule," is
very important, because it can be so readily applied to so many
cases, and will enable one so easily to think out the actual
reaction in any particular case. The rule is illustrated by the
sketch shown in Fig. 10, where a bar magnet has been placed with
its north pole opposite the south face of the circuit of the cell.
The lines of force of the magnet are drawn into the ring and
coalesce with those due to the current. According to Faraday's mode
of regarding the actions in the magnetic field there is a tendency
for the lines of force to shorten themselves. This would occur if
either the magnet were pulled into the circuit, or the circuit were
moved up toward the magnet. Each attracts the other, and whichever
of them is free to move will move in obedience to the attraction.
And the motion will in either case be such as to increase the total
number of lines of force that pass through the circuit. Lest it
should be thought that Fig. 10 is fanciful or overdrawn, we
reproduce an actual magnetic "field" made in the manner described
in the preceding article. Fig. 11 is a kind of sectional view of
Fig. 10, the circuit being represented merely by two circular spots
or holes above and below the middle line, the current flowing
toward the spectator through the lower spot, and passing in front
of the figure to the upper hole, where it flows down. Into this
circuit the pole, N, is attracted, the tendency being to draw as
many lines of force as possible into the embrace of the
circuit.

"Fig. 11.">

Fig. 11.

So far as the reasoning about these mutual actions of magnets
and currents is concerned, it would therefore appear that the lines
of force are the really important feature to be understood and
studied. All our reasons about the attractions of magnets could be
equally well thought out if there were no corporeal magnets there
at all, only collections of lines of force. Bars of iron and steel
may be regarded as convenient conductors of the lines of force; and
the poles of magnets are simply the places where the lines of force
run out of the metal into the air or vice versa. Electric
currents also may be reasoned about, and their magnetic actions
foretold quite irrespective of the copper wire that acts as a
conductor; for here there are not even any poles; the lines of
force or magnetic whirls are wholly outside the metal. There is an
important difference, however, to be observed between the case of
the lines of force of the current, and that of the lines of force
of the magnet. The lines of force of the magnet are the magnet so
far as magnetic forces are concerned; for a piece of soft iron laid
along the lines of force thereby becomes a magnet and remains a
magnet as long as the lines of force pass through it. But the lines
of force crossing through a circuit are not the same thing as the
current of electricity that flows round the circuit. You may take a
I loop of wire and put the poles of magnets on each side of it so
that the lines of force pass through in great numbers from one face
to the other, but if you have them there even for months and years
the mere presence of these lines of force will not create an
electric current even of the feeblest kind. There must be
motion to induce a current of electricity to flow in a wire
circuit.

Faraday's great discovery was, in fact, that when the pole of a
magnet is moved into, or moved out of, a coil of wire, the motion
produces, while it lasts, currents of electricity in the coil. Such
currents are known as "induced currents;" and the action is called
magneto-electric "induction." The momentary current produced by
plunging the magnet pole into the wire coil or circuit is found to
be in the opposite direction to that in which a current must be
sent if it were desired to attract the magnet pole into the coil.
If the reader will look back to Fig. 10 he will see that a north
magnet pole is being attracted in from behind into a circuit round
which, as he views it, the current flows in an opposite sense to
that in which the hands of a clock move round. Now, compare this
figure with Fig. 12, which represents the generation of a momentary
induced current by the act of moving the north pole, N, toward a
wire ring, which is in this case connected with a little detecter
galvanometer, G. The momentary current flows round the circuit (as
seen by the spectator from the front) in the same sense as
the movement of the hands of a clock. The induced current which
results from the motion is found, then, to be in a direction
exactly opposed to that of the current that would itself produce
the same movement of the magnet pole. If the north pole, instead of
being moved toward or into the circuit, were moved away from the
circuit, this motion will also induce a transient current to flow
round the wire, but this time the current will be in the same sense
as that in Fig. 10, in the opposite sense to that in Fig. 12.
Pulling the magnet pole away sets up a current in the reverse
direction to that set up by pushing the pole nearer. In both cases
the currents only last while the motion lasts.

"Fig. 12.">

Fig. 12.

Now in the first article it was pointed out that the lines of
force of the magnet indicate not only the direction, but the
strength of the magnetic forces. The stronger the pole of the
magnet is, the greater will be the number of lines of force
that radiate from its poles. The strength of the current that flows
round a circuit is also proportional to the number of lines of
force which are thereby caused to pass (as in Fig. 9) through the
circuit. The stronger the current, the more numerous the lines of
force that thread themselves through the circuit. When a magnet is
moved near a circuit near it, it is found that any alteration in
the number of lines of force that cross the circuit is accompanied
by the production of a current. Referring once more to Fig. 10, we
will call the direction of the current round the circuit in that
figure the positive direction; and to define this direction
we may remark that if we were to view the circuit from such a point
as to look along the lines of force in their own direction, the
direction of the current round the circuit will appear to be the
same as that of the hands of a clock moving round a dial. If the
magnet, N S, be now drawn away from the circuit so that fewer of
its lines of force passed through the circuit, experiment shows the
result that the current flowing in circuit will be for the moment
increased in strength, the increase in strength being
proportional to the rate of decrease in the number of lines
of force. So, on the other hand, if the magnet were pushed up
toward the circuit, the current in the circuit would be momentarily
reduced in strength, the decrease in strength in the current being
proportional to the rate of increase in the number of lines of
force.

Similar considerations apply to the case of the simple circuit
and the magnet shown in Fig. 12. In this circuit there is no
current flowing so long as the magnet is at rest; but if the magnet
be moved up toward the circuit so as to increase the number
of lines of force that pass through the circuit, there will be a
momentary "inverse" current induced in the circuit and it will flow
in the negative direction. While if the magnet were moved
away the decrease in the number of lines of force would
result in a transient "direct" current, or one flowing in the
positive direction.

It would be possible to deduce these results from an abstract
consideration of the matter from the point of view of the principle
of conservation of energy. But we prefer to reserve this point
until a general notion of the action of dynamo-electric machines
has been given.

The following principles or generalized statements follow as a
matter of the very simplest consequence from the foregoing
considerations:

(a) To induce a current in a coil of wire by means of a magnet
there must be relative motion between coil and magnet.

(b) Approach of a magnet to a coil or of a coil to a magnet
induces currents in the opposite direction to that induced by
recession.

(c) The stronger the magnet the stronger will be the induced
currents in the coils.

(d) The more rapid the motion the stronger will be the momentary
current induced in the coils (but the time it lasts will, of
course, be shorter).

(e) The greater the number of turns in the coil the stronger
will be the total current induced in it by the movement of the
magnet.

These points are of vital importance in the action of dynamo
electric generators. It remains, however, yet to be shown how these
transient and momentary induction currents can be so directed and
manipulated as to be made to combine into a steady and continuous
supply. To bring a magnet pole up toward a coil of wire is a
process which can only last a very limited time; and its recession
from the coil also cannot furnish a continuous current since it is
a process of limited duration. In the earliest machines in which
the principle of magneto-electric induction was applied, the
currents produced were of this momentary kind, alternating in
direction. Coils of wire fixed to a rotating axis were moved past
the pole of a magnet. While the coil was approaching the lines of
force were increasing, and a momentary inverse current was set up,
which was immediately succeeded by a momentary direct current as
the coil receded from the pole. Such machines on a small scale are
still to be found in opticians' shops for the purpose of giving
people shocks. On a large scale alternate current machines are
still employed for certain purposes in electric lighting, as, for
example, for use with the Jablochkoff candle. Large
alternate-current machines have been devised by Wilde, Gramme,
Siemens, De Meritens, and others.--Engineering.


ON THE UNIT WEIGHT AND MODE OF CONSTITUTION OF COMPOUNDS.

Dr. Odling delivered a lecture on the above before the Chemical
Society, London, February 2, 1882.

The lecturer said that it had been found useful to occasionally
bring forward various points of chemical doctrine, on which there
were differences of opinion, to be discussed by the society. On
this occasion he wished not so much to demonstrate certain
conclusions, or to make a declaration of his opinions, as to invite
discussion and a thoughtful consideration of questions of
importance to chemists. Originally three questions were proposed:
First, Is there any satisfactory evidence deducible of the
existence of two distinct forms of chemical combination (atomic and
molecular)? Second, Is the determination of the vapor density of a
body alone sufficient to determine the weight of the chemical
molecule? Third, In the case of an element forming two or more
distinct series of compounds, e.g., ferrous and ferric salts, is
the transition from one series to another necessarily connected
with the addition or subtraction of an even number of hydrogenoid
atoms? He would, however, limit himself to the first of these
questions; at the same time the three questions were so closely
associated with one another that in discussing the first it was
difficult to know where to begin. The answer to this question (Is
there any satisfactory evidence deducible of the existence of two
distinct forms of chemical combination?) depends materially on the
view we take of the property called in text-books valency or
atomicity; and before discussing the question it is important to
have a clear idea of what these words valency and atomicity really
mean. It is necessary, too, to start with some propositions which
must be taken for granted. These propositions are: First, that in
all chemical changes, those kinds of matter which we commonly call
elementary, do not suffer decomposition. Second, That the atomic
weights of the elements as received are correct, i.e., that they do
really express with great exactitude the relative weights of the
atoms of the individual elements. If we accept these two
propositions, it follows that hydrogen can be replaced atom for
atom by other elements not only by the hydrogens but by alkali
metals, etc. Hydrogen is, it may here be remarked, an element of
unique character; not only can it be replaced by the elements of
the widely different classes represented by chlorine and sodium,
but it is the terminal of the series of paraffins,
CnH2n; C3H6,
C2H4, H2. The third proposition
which must be taken for granted is, that the groups of elements,
C2H5, CH3, behave as elements, and
that these radicals, ethyl, methyl, etc., do not suffer
decomposition in many chemical reactions.

Now as to valency or atomicity, accepting the received atomic
weights of the elements, it is certain that there are at least four
distinct types of hydrogen compounds represented by ClH,
OH2, NH3, CH4. The recognition of
these types, and their relations to each other as types, was one of
the most important and best assured advances made in theoretical
chemistry. When we compare the formula of water with that of
hydrochloric acid, we find that there is twice as much hydrogen
combined with one atom of oxygen as there is combined with one atom
of chlorine; and in a great many other instances, we find that we
can replace two atoms of chlorine by one atom of oxygen, so that we
get an idea of the exchangeable value of these elements, and we say
that one atom of oxygen is worth two of chlorine, or is bivalent;
similarly, nitrogen is said to be trivalent. The meaning attached
to the word "valency," is simply one of interchangeability, just as
we say a penny is worth two halfpennies or four farthings. The
question next arises, is the valency of an element fixed or
variable? If the word be defined as above, it is absolutely certain
that the valency varies. Thus, tin may be trivalent,
SnCl2, or tetravalent, SnCl4. Accordingly
elements have been classed as monads, dyads, triads, etc. The
lecturer objected most strongly to the word "atomicity;" he could
not conceive of one atom being more atomic than another; he could
understand the atomicity of a molecule or the equivalency of an
atom, but not the atomicity of an atom; the expression seemed to
him complete nonsense. He next considered the possibility of
assigning a fixed limit to this valency or adicity of an atom, and
concluded that the adicity was not absolutely fixed, but was fixed
in relation to certain elements, e.g., C never combines with more
than four atoms of H; O never more than two atoms of H, etc. The
adicity of an element when combined with two or more elements is
usually higher than when combined with only one, e.g.,
NH3, NH4Cl. The term "capacity of
saturation," may be used as a synonym for adicity, if care be taken
to distinguish it from other kinds of saturation, such as an acid
with an alkali, etc. Adicity is, however, quite distinct from
combining force; the latter is indicated by the amount of heat
evolved in the combination.

The lecturer then proceeded to criticise a statement commonly
found in text books, that chemical combination suppresses
altogether the properties of the combining bodies. The reverse of
this statement is probably true. To take the case commonly given of
the combination of copper and sulphur when heated; this is good as
far as it goes, but there are numerous instances, as ClI, SSe,
etc., where the original properties and characters of the combining
elements do not completely disappear. The real statement is that
the original properties of the elements disappear more or less, and
least when the combination is weak and attended with the evolution
of a slight amount of heat, and in every case some properties are
left which can be recognized. So with reference to the question of
atomic and molecular combination, as atomic combination does not
necessarily produce change, it does not differ in this respect from
what is usually called molecular combination.

The lecturer then referred to an important difference in the
adicity of chlorine and oxygen. Chlorine can combine with methyl or
ethyl singly. Oxygen can combine with both and hold them together
in one molecule. The recognition of this fundamental difference
between chlorine and oxygen, this formation of double oxides as
opposed to single chlorides, marks an epoch in scientific
chemistry.

The lecturer then considered the subject of chemical
formul&aelig;; it is the bounden duty of every formula to express
clearly the number of atoms of each kind of elementary matter which
enters into the constitution of the molecule of the substance. A
formula may do much more than this. If we attempt to express too
much by a complex formula we may veil the number of atoms contained
in it. This difficulty may be avoided by using two formul&aelig;, a
synoptic formula giving the number of atoms present, and a complex
formula perhaps covering half a page, giving the constitution of
the molecule. But between the purely synoptic formula and the very
elaborate formula there are others--contracted formul&aelig;--which
labor under the disadvantage, as a rule, of being one-sided, and so
create a false impression as to the nature of the substance. Thus,
for instance, to take the formula of sulphuric acid,
H2SO4. This suggests that all the oxygen is
united to the S; (HO)2SO2 suggests that two
atoms of hydroxyl exist in the molecule; then, again, we might
write the formula HSO2OH, or
H2OSO3. All of these are justifiable, and
each might be useful to explain certain reactions of sulphuric
acid, but to use one only creates a false impression. The only plan
is to use them variously and capriciously, according to the
reaction to be explained. Again, ethyl acetate may be written--


          H_{3}C\
          H_{2}C/
                \
                 O
                /
              OC\
          H_{3}C/


Or condensed--


          H_{5}C_{2} \
                      }O
          H_{3}C_{2}O/


Or H5C2O.C2H3O, or
H5C2.C2H3O2.
Now each of these two latter formul&aelig; is a partial formula,
each represents a one-sided view; it is justifiable if you use
both, but unfair if you use only one.

We now come to the question as to the existence or non-existence
of two distinct classes of compounds, one in which the atoms are
combined directly or indirectly with each other, and the other in
which a group of atoms is combined as an integer with some other
group of atoms, without any atomic connection by so-called
molecular combination. These two modes of combination are
essentially distinct. The question is not one of degree. Are there
any facts to support this theory that one set of compounds is
formed in one way, another in a different way? Take the case of the
sulphates: Starting with SO3, we can replace one atom of
O by HO2, and obtain SO2(HO)2 or
H2SO4; replacing a second atom, we get
SO(HO)4 or H4SO5, glacial
sulphuric acid, a perfectly definite body corresponding to a
definite class of sulphates, e.g., H2MgSO5,
Zn2SO5, etc. By replacing the third atom of O
we get S(HO)6 or H6SOH6; this
corresponds to a class of salts, gypsum,
H4CaSO6, etc. These are admitted without
dispute to be atomic compounds. Are we to stop here? We may write
the above compounds thus: H2SO4,
H2SO4H2O,
H2SO42H2O. If we measure the heat
evolved in the formation of the two latter compounds, it is, for
H2SO4+H2O, 6.272;
H2SO4+2H2O, 3.092. But if we now
take the compound H2SO4+3H2O we
have heat evolved 1.744; so we can have
H2SO44H2O, etc. Where are we to
draw the line between atomic and molecular combination, and why? It
comes to this: All compounds which you can explain on your views of
atomicity are atomic, and all that you cannot thus explain are
molecular. Similarly with phosphates, arsenates, etc. In all these
compounds it is impossible to lay one's finger on any distinction
as regards chemical behavior between the compounds called atomic
and those usually called molecular.

Two points remain to be mentioned: The first is the relationship
between alteration of adicity and two series (ous and ic) of
compounds. Tin is usually said to be dyad in stannous compounds and
a tetrad in stannic compounds, but in a compound like
SnCl2AmCl, is not tin really a tetrad?


                 {Cl
                 {Cl
              Sn {Cl
                 {NH_{4}


and yet it is a stannous compound, and gives a black precipitate
with H2S; so that valency does not necessarily go with
the series. The second point is that an objection may be urged, as,
for example, in ammonium chloride (the lecturer stated above that
here N was a pentad, the addition of the chlorine having caused the
N to assume the pentadic character), it may be said, why should you
not suppose that it is the chlorine "which has altered its valency,
and that the compound should be written:


                 {H
                 {H
               N { \
                 {H--Cl
                 {H/


There is something to be said for this view, but on the whole
the balance of the evidence is in favor of nitrogen being a
pentad.

In conclusion the lecturer stated that his principal object was
to direct the attention of chemists, and especially of young
chemists, to the question: Is there or is there not any evidence
derived from the properties, the decompositions, or the relative
stabilities of substances to warrant us in believing that two
classes of compounds exist: one class in which there is interatomic
connection alone, and another in which the connection is
molecular?


FRENCH TOILET ARTICLES.

Mr. Martenson, of St. Petersburg, who, it will be remembered,
was one of the Russian delegates to the International
Pharmaceutical Congress, has been analyzing a number of French
preparations for the toilet, most of which are familiar to our
readers, at any rate by name and repute.

1. Eau de Fleurs de Lys--(Planchon and Riet, Paris.)--An
infallible banisher of freckles, etc., etc. The bottle contains 100
grammes of a milky fluid, made up of 97 per cent. of water, 2.5 per
cent. of precipitated calomel, and a small quantity of common salt
and corrosive sublimate, and scented with orange flower water.

2. Eau de Blanc de Perles.--The bottle contains 120
grammes of a weak alkaline solution, with a thick deposit of 15 per
cent. of carbonate of lead, and scented with otto of roses and
geranium.

3. Nouveau Blanc de Perle, Extra Fin.--(Lubin,
Paris.)--The bottles contains 35 grammes of a liquid consisting of
water, holding in suspension about equal parts of zinc oxide,
magnesic carbonate, and powdered talc, perfumed with otto of
roses.

4. Lait de Perles.--A close imitation of No. 3, the
bottle holding nearly three times the quantity for the same price.
The amount of the precipitate in this case is 20 per cent.

5. Lait de Perles.--(Legrand, Paris).--The bottles
contain 65 grammes of a thick white fluid, the precipitate from
which consists of zinc oxide and bismuth oxychloride, and is
scented with rose water.

6. Lait Antiph&eacute;lique.--(Cand&egrave;s and Co.,
Paris.)--Each bottle contains 140 grammes of a milky fluid,
smelling strongly of camphor, and having an acid reaction. It
contains alcohol, camphor, ammonic chloride, half per cent. of
corrosive sublimate, albumen, and a little free hydrochloric
acid.

7. Lait de Concombres.--The bottle contains 160 grammes
of a very inelegantly made emulsion, smelling of very common
rose-water, with an unpleasant twang about it, and giving a
strongly alkaline reaction. It consists of soap, glycerin, and
cotton seed oil, made into a semi-emulsion.

8. Cr&ecirc;me de Fleurs des Lys; Blanc de Ville
Onctueux.--About 30 grammes of a kind of weak ointment
contained in a small pomatum pot prettily ornamented. It is simply
a salve made of wax oil, and possibly lard, mixed with a large
proportion of zinc oxide, and smelling of inferior otto of
roses.

9. P&aacute;te de Velonas.-This paste consists of almond,
and possibly other meal mixed with soap powder, and has a strong
alkaline reaction. It is scented with orris-root.

10. Rouge V&eacute;g&eacute;tal.--The box contains
8&frac12; grammes of raspberry colored powder, consisting chiefly
of China clay and talc, tinted to the proper depth with extract of
cochineal.

containing 11 grammes of a deep red solution, smelling of otto of
roses and ammonia. It consists of a solution of carmine in ammonia,
with an addition of a certain amount of alcohol.

12. Rouge de Dorin.--Extract des Fleurs des
Indes.--A round pot containing a porcelain disk, covered with
about 6 grammes of a bright red paste, which is a mixture of
carthamin or safflower with talc. This rouge, which differs from
all the others, is harmless and effectual, but must bear a high
profit seeing that the ingredients cost only a few half-pence,
while it sells in St. Petersburg at about 4s. 9d. a pot.

13. Etui Myst&eacute;rieux ou Boite de Maintenon.--A
prettily got-up box containing red and white paint, and two sticks
of black and blue cosmetic for the eyebrows and veins, with camel's
hair pencils for applying the latter. Sells in St. Petersburg at
6s. 4d.

14. Philidore.--Rem&egrave;de Specifique pour oter les
Pellicules de la t&ecirc;te, etc.--The bottle contains 100
grammes of a strong alkaline solution smelling strongly of ammonia,
and containing potash, ammonia, alcohol, glycerin, and eau de
cologne.

15. Colorig&egrave;ne Rigaud.--A blue bottle containing
160 grammes of a clear fluid with a slight black deposit,
consisting of a mixture of equal parts of a 14 per cent. solution
of sodic hyposulphate, and a 4 per cent. solution of lead acetate.
Of course the longer this solution is kept the more lead sulphate
it deposits. It sells in St. Petersburg at 8s. per bottle. It is
also stated to be much more powerful if used in conjunction with
the Pommade Miranda Rigaud. This beats Mrs. Allen completely
out of the field.--Pharmaceutische Zeitschrift f&uuml;r

ON THE MYDRIATIC ALKALOIDS.

By ALBERT LADENBURG.

We translate the following important article, says the
Chemists' Journal, from the Moniteur Scientifique of
last month. It may be explained for the sake of our student readers
that the word mydriatic is derived from the Greek
mudriasis, which means paralysis of the pupil.

The synthetical researches which I have undertaken with a view
to explain the constitution of atropine have shown me the necessity
of studying the connection of atropine with the other alkaloids,
which have an analogous physiological action. According to the
early researches we could not discover any of these relationships
which only become evident when we come to study the new discoveries
which have been made in connection with the tropines, to which
class belong both duboisine and hyoscyamine, which, although
differing from atropine, are equally mydriatic in their action.

I.--ATROPINE.

Discovered by Mein in 1831 in the roots of belladonna. More
thoroughly studied some time after by Geiger and Hesse, who
confirmed Mein's results. Liebig next published an analysis of the
alkaloid, which was afterward shown to be incorrect. He
consequently modified his formula, and gave the following as the
composition of atropine;
C17H23NO3. Liebig's amended
analysis was afterward confirmed by Planta, who further showed that
the alkaloid itself melted at 194&deg; F., and its double gold salt
at 275&deg; F. It is worthy of remark that the first figure was
considered correct until my researches proved the contrary. The
physiological action of atropine, especially in relation to the
eye, has been most carefully studied by several celebrated
ophthalmologists, such as Graef, Donders, Bezold, and Bloebaum. Its
chemical properties have also been the object of very extensive
researches by Pfeiffer, Kraut, and Lassen. Pfeiffer first
discovered that benzoic acid was one of the products of
decomposition of atropine, and Kraut split atropine by means of
baryta water into atropic acid,
C9H6O2, and tropine,
C8O15NO. Lassen, who used hydrochloric acid,
discovered the true products of the splitting up of atropine, viz.,
tropic acid, C9H8O3, and tropine,
C8H15N, and proved at the same time that
atropic acid is easily formed by the action of boiling baryta water
on tropic acid, while hydrochloric acid at all temperatures forms
isatropic acid, an isomer of atropic acid. Kraut confirmed these
results, and showed that atropic acid as well as cinnamic acid
gives benzoic acid by oxidation, and hydratropic acid (the isomer
of phenylpropionic acid) by reduction with sodium amalgam. These
results are sufficient to show that tropic acid may have one of the
following two formulae.


          I                       II

         CH_{2}OH                    CH_{3}
        /                         /
C_{4}H_{5}CH           or    C_{8}H_{5}--C--OH
        \                         \
         OOHO                      COOH


Fittig and Wurster, who discovered atrolactic acid,
C2H10O3, an isomer of tropic acid,
gives tropic acid the second formula, while Burgheimar and myself
have shown that it is the true formula of atrolactic acid. Lately
we have succeeded in performing the complete synthesis of atropic
acid, and the artificial preparation of atropine has been greatly
facilitated since I have shown that we can easily reconstruct
atropine by starting from its products of decomposition, tropic
acid, and tropine.

Before my researches nothing was known of the constitution of
tropine. New unpublished researches into this problem have shown
that it closely resembles neurine,[1] a body which I hope will
speedily lead us to the complete synthesis of atropine.

[Footnote 1: As we shall probably hear a great deal about this
alkaloid, it may be as well to state that, although found in the
brain and liver, it may be prepared synthetically by the action of
ethylene oxide, (CH2)2O, water,
H2O, and trimethyiamine, N(CH3)3.
Its constitution is that of
trimethyl-ethylene-hydrate-ammonic-hydrate, and has the following
constitutional formula:


   { (CH_{2})_{2}OH
   { CH_{3}
N  { CH_{3}
   { CH_{3}
   { OH


or in other words, it is the hydrate of
trimethyl-hydrethylene-ammonium.]

The fusing point of atropine is not 194&deg; F., as stated by
Planta, but 237&deg; F. Crystallized from not too dilute alcohol it
forms crystals which are aggregations of prisms. Toluene, alcohol,
and chloroform all dissolve atropine readily. Its double gold salt
is very characteristic. It is generally precipitated in the form of
an oil which solidifies rapidly and may be crystallized from hot
water after the addition of a little hydrochloric acid. This clouds
in cooling, and after a certain time it separates in small crystals
of indeterminate form which unite in warty concretions. After
drying the salt forms a dull powder, melting between 275&deg; F.
and 280&deg; F. It also melts in boiling water, and its aqueous
solution exposed to the light is partially reduced, 100 grammes of
water acidulated with 10 cubic centimeters of 1.190&deg; solution
of hydrochloric acid dissolves 0.137 gramme of the gold salt at
136&deg; F. to 140&deg; F.

I should fancy that the above particulars are sufficent to
completely differentiate atropine from all the other mydriatic
alkaloids.

II.--THE ATROPINE OF DATURA STRAMONIUM.

Planta has already tried to show that atropine is identical with
the daturine obtained by Geiger and Hesse, founding his opinion on
facts which we nowadays look upon as doubtful. This identity was
generally admitted by all chemists. The pharmacologists, headed by
Soubeiran, Erhardt, Schroff, and Poehl, were much more reserved in
their judgment. I thought it as well, therefore, to recommence the
study of daturine, the more so as I had already determined the
incorrectness of the long accepted point of fusion of atropine, and
that my researches on hyoscyamine convinced me that this base is an
isomer of atropine, although very analogous to it. I have also
shown that Merck's daturine differs from atropine, and is merely
pure hyoscyamine. A short time afterward there appeared a paper by
Schmidt which again asserted the identity of daturine and atropine.
I therefore requested Mr. Merck, of Darmstadt, to send me all the
bases which he obtained from datura. This eminent manufacturer was
good enough to comply with my request, and sent me two products,
one of which was marked "light daturine," the other "heavy
daturine," the separation of which was effected in the following
manner: The solution of crude daturine in concentrated alcohol was
mixed with a little hot water; this treatment caused the deposition
of the "heavy daturine," while the "light daturine" remained in the
mother liquor. The "heavy daturine," of which only a small quantity
is obtainable, is far from being a body of definite composition,
that is to say, it is a mixture of atropine and hyoscyamine. If we
convert the base into a double gold salt we obtain by a single
crystallization a dull looking salt, melting at from 275&deg; F. to
280&deg; F., the appearance of which is very different to that of
atropine. I have succeeded in splitting up "heavy daturine" by two
different methods. By recrystallizing the gold salt six times from
boiling water, the salt of hyoscyamine, which melts at from
316&deg; F. to 323&deg; F., crystallizes our first, and by the
successive evaporation of the mother liquor at last obtain the pure
gold salt of atropine, which melts at 275&deg; F. to 280&deg; F. If
we only want to isolate the atropine, it is better to crystallize
the free base two or three times from alcohol at 50 per cent.,
always taking the earliest formed crystals.

These facts prove the presence of atropine in datura; but while
Planta and Schmidt assert that only this alkaloid is found in the
plant, I have proved that the proportion of atropine in it is but
small, while its richness in hyoscyamine is great. I think,
therefore, that both Planta and Schmidt must have worked with a
mixture of atropine and hyoscyamine. It is true that Schmidt had
received pure atropine under the name of daturine, for I have
proved most conclusively that the so-called daturine supplied by
Trommsdorff, of Erfurt, is pure atropine and nothing else. It has
no action whatever on polarized light.

III.--HYOSCYAMINE FROM HYOSCYAMUS.

Discovered by Geiger and Hesse in 1833. It was first obtained in
the form of needles, which were much more soluble than atropine. In
the pure state it forms a viscous mass with a repulsive odor. These
researches were repeated by Thibout, Kletinski, Ludwig, Lading,
Bucheim, Wagymar, and Renard.

Hoehn and Reichardt have recently studied hyoscyamine in a very
complete manner. They have obtained the body in the form of warty
concretions as soft as wax, and melting at 194&deg; F., having a
formula according to them of
C15H23NO3. They have also studied
the splitting up of the alkaloid by means of baryta water, and have
obtained an acid which they have named hyoscinic acid, and which
melts at about 219&deg; F., and a basic body, hyoscine,
C6H13N. They represent the reaction as
follows:

C15H23NO3 =
C9H10O3 +
C6H13N.

According to this view hyoscyamine ought to be the hyoscinate of
hyoscine, or at any rate an isomer of this body. It is to be
remarked that they compare hyoscinic acid not with tropic acid, of
which it possesses the composition, but with atropic acid,
C9H8O2. I have worked with the
hyoscyamine of both Merck and Trommsdorff, as well as with a
product which I obtained from hyoscyamus seeds myself. The best way
of purifying the alkaloid is by recrystallizing its gold salt
several times, so as to obtain it in brilliant yellow plates,
melting at 320&deg; F. By passing a stream of hydrosulphuric acid
gas through the liquor the gold is precipitated in the form of
sulphide. The liquid is filtered and evaporated, precipitated by an
excess of a strong solution of potassium carbonate, and the
alkaloid extracted by chloroform. The solution is dried over
carbonate of potassium, and part of the chloroform is distilled
off. By leaving the solution to evaporate spontaneously the
alkaloid is obtained in silky crystals. The crystals are then
dissolved in alcohol, which, on being poured into water, parts with
them in the same form.

Hyoscyamine crystallizes in the acicular form, with greater
difficulty even than atropine, it also forms less compact crystals.
Its fusing point is 149.6&deg; F. I have not yet succeeded in
crystallizing any of its more simple salts. The double platinum
salt melts at 392&deg; F., with decomposition. The double gold
salt, which has been described above, does not melt in boiling
water, and its aqueous solution is reduced neither by boiling nor
by long exposure to light. By leaving the hot saturated solution to
cool it does not cloud, but the double salt separates pretty
rapidly in the form of plates.

One liter of water containing 10 cubic centimeters of
hydrochloric acid at 1.19&deg; dissolves 65 centigrammes of the
salt at 146&deg; F.

These characteristics allow us to differentiate atropine and
hyoscyamine, the reactions of which are almost identical, as will
be seen from the following table, which shows the action of weak
solutions of the acids named on the hydrochlorates of the
bases:


_Reagents_.         _Hyoscyamine_.        _Atropine_.

DETECTION OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF MORPHIA.

By A. JORISSEN.

The solution of morphia, free from foreign bodies, is evaporated
to dryness, and the residue is heated on the water bath with a few
drops of sulphuric acid. A minute crystal of ferrous sulphate is
then added, bruised with a glass rod, stirred up in the liquid,
heated for a minute longer, and poured into a white porcelain
capsule, containing 2 to 3 c.c. strong ammonia. The morphia
solution sinks to the bottom, and where the liquids touch there is
formed a red color, passing into violet at the margin, while the
ammoniacal stratum takes a pure blue. The reaction is very distinct
to 0.0006 grm. Codeine does not give this reaction. If sulphuric
acid at 190&deg; to 200&deg; is allowed to act upon morphia, there
is ultimately formed an opaque black green mass. If this is poured
dropwise into much water, the mixture turns bluish, and if it is
then shaken up with ether or chloroform, the form takes a purple
and the latter a very permanent blue. Codeine gives the same
reaction, but no other of the alkaloids. This reaction can be
obtained very distinctly with 0.0004 grm. of morphia.




ON THE ESTIMATION OF MANGANESE BY TITRATION.

[Footnote: From Jernkontorets Annaler, vol.
xxxvi.--Iron.]

By C. G. SARNSTROM.

If we dissolve black oxide of manganese, permanganate of potash,
or any other compound of manganese of a higher degree of oxidation
than the protoxide in hydrochloric acid, we obtain, as is well
known, a dark colored solution of perchloride of manganese, which,
when heated to boiling loses color pretty rapidly, chlorine being
given off, until finally only protochloride remains. This
decomposition also proceeds at the common temperature, though much
more slowly, and we may therefore say that manganese when dissolved
in hydrochloric acid always tends to descend to its lowest, and,
considered as a base, strongest degree of oxidation, which is not
raised to a higher degree even by chameleon solution. In slightly
acid, neutral, or alkaline solutions on the other hand, protoxide
of manganese absorbs oxygen with great avidity and forms with it
different compounds, according to the means of oxidation employed.
Thus, for example, manganese is slowly deposited from an ammoniacal
solution, when it is permitted to take up oxygen from the air, as
hydrated sesquioxide, and from neutral or alkaline solutions, as
hydrated peroxide on the addition of chlorine, bromine, or
chameleon solution. For if to an acid solution of protochloride of
manganese we add a solution of bicarbonate of soda, as long as
carbonic acid escapes or till the free acid is saturated and the
protochloride of manganese converted into carbonate of protoxide of
manganese, which forms with bicarbonate of soda a soluble double
salt, resembling the carbonate of lime and magnesia, we obtain a
solution which is, indeed, acid from free carbonic acid, but has a
slight alkaline reaction with litmus paper, and with the greatest
ease deprives chameleon solution of its color, the permanganic acid
being reduced and the protoxide of manganese being oxidized to
peroxide, which is precipitated as hydrate. This reaction proceeds
according to the formula,

3MnCO3 + 2KMnO4 + H2O =
2KHCO3 + 5MnO2 + CO2

and it may be employed for estimating the content of manganese
by titration. As follows from the formula two equivalents of
permanganate of potash are required for the titration of three
equivalents of protoxide of manganese, which has also been
established by direct experiments, as well as that the escape of
carbonic acid indicated by the formula actually takes place. The
precipitate of manganese is dissolved either in water to which 0.5
per cent. of hydrochloric acid has been added, or in boiling nitric
acid. When manganese occurs along with iron, which in general is
the case, we must take care that the iron in the solution is in the
state of peroxide, which is precipitated on the addition of the
bicarbonate of soda, and is allowed to remain as a precipitate,
because it does not affect the titration injuriously. The removal
of this precipitate by filtering would be more loss than gain,
partly because there would be a risk of losing manganese in this
way, partly because the precipitate of manganese, which occurs
immediately on the addition of the chameleon solution, proceeds
both more rapidly and with greater completeness in the presence of
the iron precipitate than otherwise. This appears to be caused by
the iron precipitate as it were inclosing, and mechanically drawing
down the light manganese precipitate, provided a weak chemical
union between the two precipitates does not even take place,
depending on the tendency of peroxide of manganese to behave toward
bases, as, for instance, hydrate of lime as an acid. Hence it thus
follows that it ought to be arranged that a sufficient quantity of
iron[1] (at least the same quantity as of manganese) be present in
the liquid at titration, also that time be given for the
precipitate to fall, so that the color of the solution may be
observed between every addition of chameleon solution.

[Footnote 1: For this in case of need a solution of perchloride
of iron free of manganese may be employed.]

When the content of manganese is large, it is sometimes rather
long before the solution is ready for titration. The reason of this
appears to be that a part of the manganese is first precipitated as
hydrated sesquioxide, which is afterward oxidized to hydrated
peroxide, for the upper portion of the liquid may sometimes be
colored by chameleon, while the lower portion, which is in closer
contact with the precipitate, is less colored or absolutely
colorless. From this we also see how advisable it is to stir the
liquid frequently during titration. Toward the close of it, it is
also advantageous, when the contents of manganese are large, to
warm the solution to about 50&deg; C., because the removal of color
is thereby hastened. When the fluid, which is well stirred after
each addition of chameleon, has obtained from it a perceptible
color, which does not disappear after several stirrings, the whole
of the manganese is precipitated and the color of the solution
remains almost unchanged after the lapse of at least twelve
hours.

When the content of manganese is large the solution may be
divided into two equal portions, one of which is first to be
roughly titrated to ascertain its content approximately, after
which the whole is to be mixed together and the titration
completed, which can thus be performed with greater speed and
certainty. If too much chameleon has been added, one may titrate
back with an accurately estimated solution of manganese, which is
prepared most easily by evaporating fifteen cubic centimeters
chameleon solution down to two or three cubic centimeters, boiling
with two to three cubic centimeters hydrochloric acid so long as
the smell of chlorine is observed, and then diluting the solution
to ten cubic centimeters, when one cubic centimeter of it
corresponds to the same measure of chameleon.

With respect to the delay which must take place during the
titration in order to give the precipitate time to fall, it is
advantageous, in order to save time, to work with several samples;
but it is, in such a case, desirable to have a separate burette for
each sample, in order to avoid noting every addition of the
chameleon solution and afterward adding them up. If burettes are
wanting, and one must be used for several samples, a Mohr's burette
with glass cock is the most convenient to use. For the titration of
iron with chameleon solution, the latter is commonly used of such a
strength that 0.01 gramme of iron corresponds to about one cubic
centimeter of chameleon solution, which is obtained by dissolving
5.75 grammes permanganate of potash in 1,000 cubic centimeters
water. The titration is determined by means of iron, a salt of iron
or oxalic acid. A drop of such a solution, corresponding to about
one-twentieth cubic centimeter, or 0.0001 gramme Mn, is sufficient
to give a perceptible reddish color to 200 cubic centimeters of
water.

As what takes place in the titration of iron with chameleon is
indicated by the following formula,

10FeO + 2KMnO4 = 5Fe2O3 +
K2O + 2MnO2,

it appears, on making a comparison with the formula given above,
that ten equivalents of iron correspond to three equivalents of
manganese, and that there is thus required for three equivalents
manganese as much chameleon solution as for ten equivalents iron.
When we know the titration of the chameleon solution for iron, that
for manganese is obtained by multiplying the former by (3 x 55)/(10
x 56) =0.295. If, for instance, one cubic centimeter chameleon
solution corresponds to 0.01 gramme iron, the figure for manganese
is 0.01 x 0.295 = 0.00295 gramme per cubic centimeter.

We can of course also determine the titration for manganese in a
chameleon solution with the greatest certainty by titrating a
compound of manganese with an accurately estimated content of it,
for instance, a spiegeleisen or ferromanganese; the test is carried
out in the following way: The substance, which is to be examined
for manganese, is dissolved by means of hydrochloric acid. If the
manganese, as in slags, be combined with silica, it is frequently
necessary first to fuse the specimen with soda. Iron ores and
refinery cinders may indeed, if they are reduced to a very fine
state of division, be commonly decomposed by boiling with
hydrochloric acid with or without the addition of sulphuric acid,
but the undissolved silica is generally rendered impure by
manganese, which can only be removed by fusion with soda.

The dissolving of the fused mass in hydrochloric acid does not
need to be carried to dryness for the separation of the soluble
silica, but the boiling, after the addition of a little nitric
acid, is only kept up until the iron passes into perchloride and
the manganese into protochloride. The quantity, which ought to be
taken for the test, depends on the accuracy with which it is
desired to have the manganese estimated.

Of ferromanganese and other very manganiferous substances, in
which the manganese need not be determined with greater exactness
than to 0.1 per cent., only 0.01 gram. is taken for a test; but of
common pig, wrought iron, steel, iron ore, slags, etc., there is
taken 0.5 to 1 gramme according to the supposed content of
manganese and the desired exactness of the estimation. For instance
one gramme iron, which has passed through a metal sieve with holes
half a millimeter in diameter, is placed in a beaker 125 mm. in
height and 60 mm. in diameter, and has added to it twenty cubic
centimeters of hydrochloric acid of 1.12 specific gravity, which,
with a well-fitting glass cover, is boiled for half an hour, in
order that the combined carbon may be driven off in the shape of
gas. After at least the half of the hydrochloric acid has been
boiled away, there are added at least five cubic centimeters nitric
acid of 1.2 specific gravity, partly to bring the iron to peroxide,
partly to destroy the organic matters formed from the carbon, which
might possibly be remaining and might tend to remove the color of
the chameleon solution. The boiling is now continued till near
dryness, when five cubic centimeters hydrochloric acid are added,
after which the solution is boiled as long as any reddish-yellow
vapors of nitrous acid are observed. When these have disappeared a
drop of the liquid taken up on a small glass rod is tested with an
newly prepared solution of red prussiate of potash (2 grammes in
100 cubic centimeters water), to ascertain whether there is any
protoxide of iron remaining. First, when no indication of blue or
green is visible, the test shows a pure yellow, it is certain that
there are no reducing substances in the solution.

If a trace of protoxide of iron remains in the solution another
cubic centimeter of nitric acid ought to be added and the boiling
continued so long as any reddish-yellow vapors are visible, more
hydrochloric acid also being added to keep the solution from being
dried up. The process is continued in this way until two tests have
given no reaction of protoxide of iron, when the solution is
diluted with water; but no dilution should take place until the
oxidation is complete, because in the course of it the solution
ought to be kept as concentrated as possible. Silica, and graphite
when it is present, need not be removed by filtration, if it is not
intended to estimate them, or there be no fear that the graphite is
accompanied by any humous substance, or that any oily, viscous
compound has been deposited on the sides of the beaker. In the last
mentioned case the solution should be transferred into another
beaker, and filtered, if graphite be present. When the solution is
evaporated to dryness, the remainder has five cubic centimeters
hydrochloric acid added to it, and the liquid is then brought to
boiling in order that the perchloride of manganese possibly formed
during the evaporation to dryness may be reduced to protochloride,
after which the solution is diluted with water till it measures
about 100 cubic centimeters. To this is now added in small portions
and with constant stirring as much of a saturated solution of
bicarbonate of soda (thirteen parts water dissolve one part salt),
that all the iron is precipitated, after which, when the escape of
carbonic acid has ceased, the solution is diluted with water till
it measures 200 cubic centimeters and is then ready for
titration.

A large excess of bicarbonate ought to be avoided, because in a
solution of pure protochloride of manganese it renders the liquid
milky and turbid; the addition of more water, however, makes it
clear. The solution of bicarbonate must be free from organic
substances which may tend to remove the color of the chameleon
solution. To ascertain this, the latter is added to the former drop
by drop so long as the color is removed.

If it be desired to estimate the silica in the same test, the
iron, as when it is analyzed for silica, may be also dissolved in
sulphuric acid, and afterward oxidized with nitric acid, after
which the solution is boiled to near dryness, so that the organic
substances are completely destroyed. In order afterward, to drive
off the nitric acid and get the manganese with certainty reduced to
protoxide, the solution is boiled with a little hydrochloric acid.
In this way the solution goes on rapidly and conveniently, but the
titration takes longer time than when the iron is dissolved in
hydrochloric acid, because the iron precipitate is more voluminous,
and, in consequence, longer in being deposited. To diminish this
inconvenience the solution ought to be made larger. In such a case
the rule for dissolving is, one gramme iron (more if the content of
silica is small) is dissolved in a mixture of two cubic centimeters
sulphuric acid of 1.83 specific gravity and twelve cubic
centimeters of water in the way described above, and boiled until
salt of iron begins to be deposited on the bottom of the beaker.
Five cubic centimeters hydrochloric acid are now added, and the
solution tested with red prussiate of potash for protoxide of iron,
and the boiling continued till near dryness, when all the nitric
acid is commonly driven off. Should nitrous acid still show itself,
some more hydrochloric acid is added and the boiling continued.

As in dissolving in hydrochloric acid and oxidizing with nitric
acid the solution ought to be twice tested for protoxide of iron,
even although at the first test none can be discovered. The silica
is taken upon a filter, dried, ignited, and weighed. The filtrate
is treated with bicarbonate of soda, and titrated with chameleon
solution in the way described above. If the content of manganese is
small (under 0.5 per cent.) it is not necessary to warm the liquid
before titration; but in proportion as the content of manganese is
larger there is so much greater reason to hasten the removal of
color by warming and constant stirring toward the close of the
titration.




ON THE ESTIMATION AND SEPARATION OF MANGANESE.

[Footnote: Read before the American Chemical Society, Dec. 16,
1881]

By NELSON H. DARTON.

The element manganese having many peculiarities in its reactions
with the other elements, is now extensively used in the arts, its
combinations entering into and are used in many of the important
processes; it is consequently often brought before the chemist in
his analysis, and has to be determined in most cases with
considerable accuracy. Many methods have been proposed for this,
all of them of more or less value; those yielding the best results,
however, requiring a considerable length of time for their
execution, and involving so large an amount of manipulatory skill
as to render them fairly impracticable to a chemist at all pressed
for time, and receiving but a mere trifle for the results.

As I have had to make numerous estimations of manganese in
various compounds, as a public analyst, I have been induced to
investigate the volumetric methods at present in use to find their
comparative values, and if possible to work out a new one, setting
aside one or more of the difficulties met with in the use of the
older ones. This paper is a part summary of the results. First, I
will detail my process of estimation, then on the separation.

From all compounds of manganese, excepting those containing
cobalt and nickel, the manganese is precipitated as binoxide; those
containing these two elements are treated with phosphoric acid, or
as noted under Separation.

A.--The Estimation. The binoxide of commerce, as taken from the
mine, is well sampled, powdered, and dried at 100&deg;C. 0.5 gramme
of this is taken and placed in a 250 c.c. flask; in analysis the
binoxide on the filter, from the treatments noted under separation
is thoroughly washed with warm water; it is then washed down in a
flask, as above, after breaking the filter paper; sufficient water
is added to one-third fill the flask, and about twice the
approximate weight of the binoxide in the flask of oxalate of
potassa; these are agitated together. A twice perforated stopper is
fitted to this flask, carrying through one opening a 25 c c.
pipette nearly filled with sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1.4, the lower
point of which just dips below the mixture in the flask, and the
upper end, carrying a rubber tube and pinch cock to control the
flow of acid. Through the other opening passes a glass tube bent at
an acute angle and connected by a short rubber tube to an adjoining
flask, two-thirds filled with decinormal baryta solutions. These
connections are all made air tight. Sulphuric acid is allowed in
small portions at a time to flow into the mixture. Carbonic acid is
evolved, and, passing into the adjoining flask, is absorbed by the
baryta, precipitating it as carbonate. To prevent the precipitate
forming around or choking up the entrance tube, the flask must be
agitated at short intervals to break it off. The reaction so
familiar to us in other determinations is expressed thus:

MnO2+KO,C2O3+2SO3 =
MnO,SO3+KO.SO3+2CO2,

When no more carbonic acid is evolved, another tube from this
last flask is connected with the aspirator, the pinch-cock of the
pipette open, and air drawn through the apparatus for about half a
minute, and thus all the carbonic acid evolved absorbed, or the
flasks may be slightly heated. If danger of more carbonic acid
being absorbed from the air is feared, and always in very accurate
analysis, a potassa tube may be connected to the pipette before
drawing the air through. The precipitate formed is allowed to
settle, 50 c.c. of the supernatant solution is removed with a
pipette and transferred to a beaker; 50 c.c. of decinormal nitric
acid and some water is added with sufficient cochineal tincture. It
is then titrated back with decinormal soda; from this is now
readily deducted the amount of carbonic acid, and from that the
MnO2, holding in view that 44 parts of carbonic acid is
equivalent to 43.5 of MnO2 or 98.87 per cent, and that 1
c.c. of the N/10 baryta solution is equivalent to 0.0022 grm. of
CO2.

If a carbonate, chloride, or nitrate, be present in the native
binoxide, it must be removed with some sulphuric acid. This is
afterward neutralized with a little caustic soda. This method
yields the following results for its value in amount of manganese
to 100: 99.91-99.902-99.895, and can be executed in about twenty
minutes. Fifteen determinations can be carried on at once without
loss of time, this, however, depending on the operator's skill. I
have made many assays, and assays by this method with similarly
excellent results.

Of the other methods, Bunsen's is acknowledged to be the most
accurate, but is, of course, too troublesome to be used in
technical work, although it is used in scientific analysis.
Ordinary samples are not sufficiently accurate to allow the use of
this method.

The methods of reducing with iron and titrating this with
chromate of potassa, etc., have given a constant average of from
98.60-99.01. These results are fair, but hard to obtain
expeditiously.

Of the methods of precipitating the compounds of the protoxide
and estimating the acid, that of the phosphate is by far the most
accurate, titrating with uranium solution; 99.82 is a nearly
constant average with me, much depending on the operator's
familiarity with the uranium process.

The methods of Lenssen, or ferricyanide of potassium method,
yields very widely differing results. I have found the figures of
Fresenius about the same as my own in this case; that is from
98.00-100.10.

B.--On the Separation. First, from its soluble simple
combinations with the acids or bases containing no iron or cobalt;
if they are present, it is treated as is noted later. If sulphuric
acid is present it must be separated by treating the solution of
the compound with barium chloride and filtering. A nearly neutral
solution is prepared in water or hydrochloric acid and placed in a
flask. Here it is treated with chlorine by passing a current of
that gas through it as long as it causes a precipitate and for some
time afterward. It is then discontinued, the mixture allowed to
deposit for a few moments, and about two-thirds of the supernatant
solution decanted; it is mixed with some more water, and these
decantations repeated until they pass away without reaction, or by
filtering it and washing on the filter; it is then dissolved in hot
hydrochloric acid, this nearly neutralized, a solution of
sesquichloride of iron is added, and again treated with an excess
of chlorine. After washing it is transferred to the flasks of the
apparatus mentioned in the first part of this paper, and estimated.
Myself and several others have found this always to be a true
MnO2, and not a varying mixture of protosesquioxide and
binoxide, and will thus yield accurate results. This
reprecipitation may sometimes be dispensed with by adding the iron
salt before the first precipitation, but it of course depends upon
the other elements present.

From Compounds containing Cobalt, Cobalt and Nickel, Iron and
group III., together or with other elements.--Group III. and
sesqui. iron are separated by agitation with baryta carbonate, some
chloride of ammonia being added to prevent nickel and cobalt
precipitation traces, and filtering. If cobalt is present we treat
this filtrate with nitrite of potassa, etc., to separate it (that
is, if it and nickel are to be separated and estimated in the same
sample; but if they are to be estimated as one, or not separated,
the treatment with nitrite, etc., is not used). The filtrate from
this last is directly treated with chlorine. If nickel and cobalt
are not to be estimated in this sample, the solution, as chlorides,
is mixed with some chloride of ammonium and ammonia, then with a
fair excess of phosphoric acid, a sufficient quantity more of
ammonia to render the mixture alkaline. The precipitate formed is
transferred to the filter and well washed with water containing
NH3Cl and NH4O, then dissolved in
hydrochloric acid and reprecipitated with ammonia, filtering and
washing as before. It is again dissolved in HCl and titrated with
uranium solution, or decomposed by tin, as noted below, and the
manganese precipitated as binoxide with chlorine, and determined.
The latter method is hardly practicable, and I never have time to
use it, as the titration and all together yields a value of 99.80
in most cases, if accurately executed.

From the bases of groups V. and VI. these are separated by
hydrogen sulphide, from iron in alloys, ores, etc., and in general
the iron is separated as basic acetate, and the manganese afterward
precipitated with chlorine. Bromine is generally used in place of
chlorine, the use of which chemists claim as troublesome; but in a
number of examinations I have found it to yield more satisfactory
results than bromine, which is much more expensive.

From the acids in insoluble and a few other compounds, chromic,
arsenic, and arsenious acids, by fusion with carbonate of soda in
presence of carbonic acid gas; borate of manganese is readily
decomposed when the boracic acid is to be determined by boiling
with solution of potassa, dissolving the residue in hydrochloric
acid and precipitating the manganese as binoxide. This boiling,
however, is seldom needed, as the borate is soluble in HCl.

From phosphoric acid I always use Girard's method of treatment
with tin, using it rasped, and it yields much more accurate results
with but little manipulation. When the other acids mentioned above
are present in the compound, we treat it as directed there.

From silicic acid, by evaporation with hydrochloric acid.

From sulphur or iodine, by decomposing with sulphuric acid and
separating this with baryta chloride.




RESEARCHES ON ANIMALS CONTAINING CHLOROPHYL.

[Footnote: Abstract of a paper "On the Nature and Functions of
the 'Yellow Cells' of Radiolarians and Coelenterates," read to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh, on January 14, 1882, and published by
permission of the Council.--Nature.]

It is now nearly forty years since the presence of chlorophyl in
certain species of planarian worms was recognized by Schultze.
Later observers concluded that the green color of certain
infusorians, of the common fresh water hydra and of the fresh water
sponge, was due to the same pigment, but little more attention was
paid to the subject until 1870, when Ray Lankester applied the
spectroscope to its investigation. He thus considerably extended
the list of chlorophyl containing animals, and his results are
summarized in Sachs' Botany (Eng. ed.). His list includes, besides
the animals already mentioned, two species of Radiolarians, the
common green sea anemone (Anthea cereus, var.
Smaragdina), the remarkable Gephyrean, Bonellia
viridis, a Polych&aelig;te worm, Ch&aelig;toperus, and
even a Crustacean, Idotea viridis.

The main interest of the question of course lies in its bearing
on the long-disputed relations between plants and animals; for,
since neither locomotion nor irritability is peculiar to animals;
since many insectivorous plants habitually digest solid food; since
cellulose, that most characteristic of vegetable products, is
practically identical with the tunicin of Ascidians, it becomes of
the greatest interest to know whether the chlorophyl of animals
preserves its ordinary vegetable function of effecting or aiding
the decomposition of carbonic anhydride and the synthetic
production of starch. For although it had long been known that
Euglena evolved oxygen in sunlight, the animal nature of
such an organism was merely thereby rendered more doubtful than
ever. In 1878 I had the good fortune to find at Roscoff the
material for the solution of the problem in the grass-green
planarian, Convoluta schultzii, of which multitudes are to
be found in certain localities on the coast, lying on the sand,
covered only by an inch or two of water, and apparently basking in
the sun. It was only necessary to expose a quantity of these
animals to direct sunlight to observe the rapid evolution of
bubbles of gas, which, when collected and analyzed, yielded from 45
to 55 per cent. of oxygen. Both chemical and histological
observations showed the abundant presence of starch in the green
cells, and thus these planarians, and presumably also Hydra
spongilla, etc., were proved to be truly "vegetating
animals."

Being at Naples early in the spring of 1879, I exposed to
sunlight some of the reputedly chlorophyl containing animals to be
obtained there, namely, Bonellia viridis and Idotea
viridis, while Krukenberg had meanwhile been making the same
experiment with Bonellia and Anthea at Trieste. Our
results were totally negative, but so far as Bonellia was
concerned this was not to be wondered at since the later
spectroscopic investigations of Sorby and Schenk had fully
confirmed the opinion of Lacaze-Duthiers as to the complete
distinctness of its pigment from chlorophyl. Krukenberg, too, who
follows these investigators in terming it bonellein, has
recently figured the spectra of Anthea-green, and this also seems
to differ considerably from chlorophyl, while I am strongly of the
opinion that the pigment of the green crustaceans is, if possible,
even more distinct, having not improbably a merely protective
resemblance.

It is now necessary to pass to the discussion of a widely
distinct subject--the long outstanding enigma of the nature and
functions of the "yellow cells" of Radiolarians. These bodies were
first so called by Huxley in his description of
Thallassicolla, and are small bodies of distinctly cellular
nature, with a cell wall, well defined nucleus, and protoplasmic
contents saturated by a yellow pigment. They multiply rapidly by
transverse division, and are present in almost all Radiolarians,
but in very variable number. Johnnes Muller at first supposed them
to be concerned with reproduction, but afterward gave up this view.
In his famous monograph of the Radiolarians, Haeckel suggests that
they are probably secreting cells or digestive glands in the
simplest form, and compares them to the liver-cells of Amphioxus,
and the "liver-cells" described by Vogt in Velella and
Porpita. Later he made the remarkable discovery that starch
was present in notable quantity in these yellow cells, and
considered this as confirming his view that these cells were in
some way related to the function of nutrition. In 1871 a very
remarkable contribution to our knowledge of the Radiolarians was
published by Cienkowski, who strongly expressed the opinion that
these yellow cells were parasitic alg&aelig;, pointing out that our
only evidence of their Radiolarian nature was furnished by their
constant occurrence in most members of the group. He showed that
they were capable not only of surviving the death of the
Radiolarian, but even of multipying, and of passing through an
encysted and an amoeboid state, and urged their mode of development
and the great variability of their numbers within the same species
as further evidence of his view.

The next important work was that of Richard Hertwig, who
inclined to think that these cells sometimes developed from the
protoplasm of the Radiolarian, and failing to verify the
observations of Cienkowski, maintained the opinion of Haeckel that
the yellow cells "fur den Stoffwechsel der Radiolarien von
Bedeutung sind." In a later publication (1879) he, however,
hesitates to decide as to the nature of the yellow cells, but
suggests two considerations as favoring the view of their parasitic
nature--first, that yellow cells are to be found in Radiolarians
which possess only a single nucleus, and secondly, that they are
absent in a good many species altogether.

A later investigator, Dr. Brandt, of Berlin, although failing to
confirm Haeckel's observations as to the presence of starch, has
completely corroborated the main discovery of Cienkowski, since he
finds the yellow cells to survive for no less than two months after
the death of the Radiolarian, and even to continue to live in the
gelatinous investment from which the protoplasm had long departed
in the form of swarm-spores. He sum up the evidence strongly in
favor of their parasitic nature.

Meanwhile similar bodies were being described by the
investigators of other groups. Haeckel had already compared the
yellow cells of Radiolarians to the so-called liver-cells of
Velella; but the brothers Hertwig first recalled attention
to the subject in 1879 by expressing their opinion that the
well-known "pigment bodies" which occur in the endoderm cells of
the tentacles of many sea-anemones were also parasitic alg&aelig;.
This opinion was founded on their occasional occurrence outside the
body of the anemone, on their irregular distribution in various
species, and on their resemblance to the yellow cells of
Radiolarians. But they did not succeed in demonstrating the
presence of starch, cellulose, or chlorophyl. The last of this long
series of researches is that of Hamann (1881), who investigates the
similar structures which occur in the oral region of the Rhizostome
jelly-fishes. While agreeing with Cienkowski as to the parasitic
nature of the yellow cells of Radiolarians, he holds strongly that
those of anemones and jelly-fishes are unicellular glands.

In the hope of clearing up these contradictions, I returned to
Naples in October last, and first convinced myself of the accuracy
of the observation of Cienkowski and Brandt as to the survival of
the yellow cells in the bodies of dead Radiolarians, and their
assumption of the encysted and the amoeboid states. Their mode of
division, too, is thoroughly algoid. One finds, not unfrequently,
groups of three and four closely resembling Protococcus.
Starch is invariably present; the wall is true plant-cellulose,
yielding a magnificent blue with iodine and sulphuric acid, and the
yellow coloring matter is identical with that of diatoms, and
yields the same greenish residue after treatment with alcohol. So,
too, in Velella, in sea-anemones, and in medus&aelig;; in all cases
the protoplasm and nucleus, the cellulose, starch, and chlorophyl,
can be made out in the most perfectly distinct way. The failure of
former observers with these reactions, in which I at first also
shared, has been simply due to neglect of the ordinary botanical
precautions. Such reactions will not succeed until the animal
tissue has been treated with alcohol and macerated for some hours
in a weak solution of caustic potash. Then, after neutralizing the
alkali by means of dilute acetic acid, and adding a weak solution
of iodine, followed by strong sulphuric acid, the presence of
starch and cellulose can be successively demonstrated. Thus, then,
the chemical composition, as well as the structure and mode of
division of these yellow cells, are those of unicellular
alg&aelig;, and I accordingly propose the generic name of
Philozoon, and distinguish four species, differing slightly
in size, color, mode of division, behavior with reagents, etc., for
which the name of P. radiolarum, P. siphonophorum, P.
actiniarum, and P. medusarum, according to their
habitat, may be conveniently adopted. It now remains to inquire
what is their mode of life, and what their function.

I next exposed a quantity of Radiolarians (chiefly
Collozoum) to sunshine, and was delighted to find them soon
studded with tiny gas-bubbles. Though it was not possible to obtain
enough for a quantitative analysis, I was able to satisfy myself
that the gas was not absorbed by caustic potash, but was partly
taken up by pyrogallic acid, that is to say, that little or no
carbonic acid was present, but that a fair amount of oxygen was
present, diluted of course by nitrogen. The exposure of a shoal of
the beautiful blue pelagic Siphonophore, Velella, for a few
hours, enabled me to collect a large quantity of gas, which yielded
from 24 to 25 per cent. of oxygen, that subsequently squeezed out
from the interior of the chambered cartilaginous float, giving only
5 per cent. But the most startling result was obtained by the
exposure of the common Anthea cereus, which yielded great
quantities of gas containing on an average from 32 to 38 per cent.
of oxygen.

At first sight it might seem impossible to reconcile this
copious evolution of oxygen with the completely negative results
obtained from the same animal by so careful an experimenter as
Krukenberg, yet the difficulty is more apparent than real. After
considerable difficulty I was able to obtain a large and beautiful
specimen of Anthea cereus, var. smaragdina, which is
a far more beautiful green than that with which I had been before
operating--the dingy brownish-olive variety, plumosa. The
former owes its color to a green pigment diffused chiefly through
the ectoderm, but has comparatively few alg&aelig; in its endoderm;
while in the latter the pigment is present in much smaller
quantity; but the endoderm cells are crowded by alg&aelig;. An
ordinary specimen of plumosa was also taken, and the two
were placed in similar vessels side by side, and exposed to full
sunshine; by afternoon the specimen of plumosa had yielded
gas enough for an analysis, while the larger and finer
smaragdina had scarcely produced a bubble. Two varieties of
Ceriactis aurantiaca, one with, the other without, yellow
cells, were next exposed, with a precisely similar result. The
complete dependence of the evolution of oxygen upon the presence of
alg&aelig;, and its complete independence of the pigment proper to
the animal, were still further demonstrated by exposing as many as
possible of those anemones known to contain yellow cells
(Aiptasia cham&aelig;leon, Helianthus troglodytes, etc.)
side by side with a large number of forms from which these are
absent (Actinia mesembryanthemum, Sagastia parasitica,
Cerianthus, etc.). The former never failed to yield abundant
gas rich in oxygen, while in the latter series not a single bubble
ever appeared.

Thus, then, the coloring matter described as chlorophyl by
Lankester has really been mainly derived from that of the
endodermal alg&aelig; of the variety plumosa, which
predominates at Naples; while the anthea-green of Krukenberg must
mainly consist of the green pigment of the ectoderm, since the
Trieste variety evidently does not contain alg&aelig; in any great
quantity. But since the Naples variety contains a certain amount of
ordinary green pigment, and since the Trieste variety is tolerably
sure to contain some alg&aelig;, both spectroscopists have been
operating on a mixture of two wholly distinct
pigments--diatom-yellow and anthea-green.

But what is the physiological relationship of the plants and
animal thus so curiously and intimately associated? Every one knows
that all the colorless cells of a plant share the starch formed by
the green cells; and it seems impossible to doubt that the endoderm
cell or the Radiolarian, which actually incloses the vegetable
cell, must similarly profit by its labors. In other words, when the
vegetable cell dissolves its own starch, some must needs pass out
by osmose into the surrounding animal cell; nor must it be
forgotten that the latter possesses abundance of amylolytic
ferment. Then, too, the Philozoon is subservient in another
way to the nutritive function of the animal, for after its short
life it dies and is digested; the yellow bodies supposed by various
observers to be developing cells being nothing but dead alg&aelig;
in progress of solution and disappearance.

Again, the animal cell is constantly producing carbonic acid and
nitrogenous waste, but these are the first necessities of life to
our alga, which removes them, so performing an intracellular renal
function, and of course reaping an abundant reward, as its rapid
rate of multiplication shows.

Nor do the services of the Philozoon end here; for during
sunlight it is constantly evolving nascent oxygen directly into the
surrounding animal protoplasm, and thus we have actually foreign
chlorophyl performing the respiratory function of native
h&aelig;moglobin! And the resemblance becomes closer when we bear
in mind that h&aelig;moglobin sometimes lies as a stationary
deposit in certain tissues, like the tongue muscles of certain
mollusks, or the nerve cord of Aphrodite and Nemerteans.

The importance of this respiratory function is best seen by
comparing as specimens the common red and white Gorgonia, which are
usually considered as being mere varieties of the same species,
G. verrucosa. The red variety is absolutely free from
Philozoon, which could not exist in such deeply colored
light, while the white variety, which I am inclined to think is
usually the larger and better grown of the two, is perfectly
crammed. Just as with the anemones above referred to, the red
variety evolves no oxygen in sunlight, while the white yields an
abundance, and we have thus two widely contrasted physiological
varieties, as I may call them, without the least morphological
difference. The white specimen, placed in spirit, yields a strong
solution of chlorophyl; the red, again, yields a red solution,
which was at once recognized as being tetronerythrin by my friend
M. Merejkowsky, who was at the same time investigating the
distribution and properties of that remarkable pigment, so widely
distributed in the animal kingdom. This substance, which was first
discovered in the red spots which decorate the heads of certain
birds, has recently been shown by Krukenberg to be one of the most
important of the coloring matter of sponges, while Merejkowsky now
finds it in fishes and in almost all classes of invertebrate
animals. It has been strongly suspected to be an oxygen-carrying
pigment, an idea to which the present observation seems to me to
yield considerable support. It is moreover readily bleached by
light, another analogy to chlorophyl, as we know from Pringsheim's
researches.

When one exposes an aquarium full of Anthea to sunlight,
the creatures, hitherto almost motionless, begin to wave their
arms, as if pleasantly stimulated by the oxygen which is being
developed in their tissues. Specimens which I kept exposed to
direct sunshine for days together in a shallow vessel placed on a
white slab, soon acquired a dark, unhealthy hue, as if being
oxygenated too rapidly, although I protected them from any undue
rise of temperature by keeping up a flow of cold water. So, too, I
found that Radiolarians were killed by a day's exposure to
sunshine, even in cool water, and it is to the need for escaping
this too rapid oxidation that I ascribe their remarkable habit of
leaving the surface and sinking into deep water early in the
day.

It is easy, too, to obtain direct proof of this absorption of a
great part of the evolved oxygen by the animal tissues through
which it has to pass. The gas evolved by a green alga (Ulva)
in sunlight may contain as much as 70 per cent. of oxygen, that
evolved by brown algae (Haliseris) 45 per cent., that from
diatoms about 42 per cent.; that, however, obtained from the
animals containing Philozoon yielded a very much lower
percentage of oxygen, e.g. Velella 24 per cent., white
Gorgonia 24 per cent., Ceriactis 21 per cent., while
Anthea, which contains most alg&aelig;, gave from 32 to 38 per
cent. This difference is naturally to be accounted for by the
avidity for oxygen of the animal cells.

Thus, then, for a vegetable cell no more ideal existence can be
imagined than that within the body of an animal cell of sufficient
active vitality to manure it with carbonic acid and nitrogen waste,
yet of sufficient transparency to allow the free entrance of the
necessary light. And conversely, for an animal cell there can be no
more ideal existence than to contain a vegetable cell, constantly
removing its waste products, supplying it with oxygen and starch,
and being digestible after death. For our present knowledge of the
power of intracellular digestion possessed by the endoderm cells of
the lower invertebrates removes all difficulties both as to the
mode of entrance of the alg&aelig;, and its fate when dead. In
short, we have here the relation of the animal and the vegetable
world reduced to the simplest and closest conceivable form.

It must be by this time sufficiently obvious that this
remarkable association of plant and animal is by no means to be
termed a case of parasitism. If so, the animals so infested would
be weakened, whereas their exceptional success in the struggle for
existence is evident. Anthea cereus, which contains most
alg&aelig;, probably far outnumbers all the other species of
sea-anemones put together, and the Radiolarians which contain
yellow cells are far more abundant than those which are destitute
of them. So, too, the young gonophores of Velella, which bud off
from the parent colony and start in life with a provision of
Philozoon (far better than a yolk-sac) survive a fortnight
or more in a small bottle--far longer than the other small pelagic
animals. Such instances, which might easily be multiplied, show
that the association is beneficial to the animals concerned.

The nearest analogue to this remarkable partnership is to be
found in the vegetable kingdom, where, as the researches of
Schwendener, Bornet, and Stahl have shown, we have certain
alg&aelig; and fungi associating themselves into the colonies we
are accustomed to call lichens, so that we may not unfairly call
our agricultural Radiolarians and anemones animal lichens.
And if there be any parasitism in the matter, it is by no means of
the alga upon the animal, but of the animal, like the fungus, upon
the alga. Such an association is far more complex than that of the
fungus and alga in the lichen, and indeed stands unique in
physiology as the highest development, not of parasitism, but of
the reciprocity between the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Thus,
then, the list of supposed chlorophyl containing animals with which
we started, breaks up into three categories; first those which do
not contain chlorophyl at all, but green pigments of unknown
function (Bonelia&lt;, Idotea, etc.); secondly, those
vegetating by their own intrinsic chlorophyl (Convoluta,
Hydra, Spongilia); thirdly, those vegetating by
proxy, if one may so speak, rearing copious algae in their own
tissues, and profiting in every way by the vital activities of
these.

COMPRESSED OIL GAS FOR LIGHTING CARS, STEAMBOATS, AND
BUOYS.

We give in the accompanying figures the arrangement of the
different apparatus necessary for the manufacture and compression
of illuminating gas on the system of Mr. Pintsch, as well as the
arrangements adopted by the inventor for the lighting of railway
cars and buoys. This system has been adopted to some extent in both
Germany and England, and is also being introduced into France.

"WORKS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OIL GAS.--ELEVATION AND PLAN.">


WORKS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OIL GAS.--ELEVATION AND
PLAN.

The Pintsch gas is prepared by the distillation of heavy oils in
a furnace composed of two superposed retorts. The oil to be
volatilized is contained in a vertical reservoir B, which carries a
bent pipe that enters the upper retort, A. The flow of the oil is
regulated in this conduit by means of a micrometer screw which
permits of varying the supply according to the temperature of the
retorts. In order to facilitate the vaporization, the flow of oil
starts from a cast-iron trough, C, and from thence spreads in a
thin and uniform layer in the retort. The residua of distillation
remain almost entirely in the reservoir, O, from whence they are
easily removed. The vapor from the oil which is disengaged in the
vessel, A, goes to the lower retort, D, in which the transformation
of the matter is thoroughly completed. On leaving the latter, the
gas enters the drum, E, at the lower part of the furnace. To
prevent the choking up of the pipe, R, the latter is provided with
a joint permitting of dilatation. The gas on leaving E goes to the
condenser, G G, where it is freed from its tar. The latter flows
out, and the gas proceeds to the washer, J, and the purifiers, I
and I, to be purified. The amount of production is registered by
the meter, L.

When the gas is to be utilized for lighting railway cars or
buoys, it is compressed in the accumulators, T, which are large
cylindrical reservoirs of riveted or welded iron plate.

Compression is effected by means of a pump, F or F', which sucks
the gas into a desiccating cylinder, M, connected with the
gasometer of the works The pump, F, which is used when the
production is larger than usual, has two compressing cylinders of
different diameters, one measuring 170 millimeters and the other
100. The piston has a stroke of 320 millimeters. The two
compressing cylinders are double acting, and communicate with each
other by valves so arranged as to prevent injurious spaces. The gas
drawn from the gasometer is first compressed in the larger cylinder
to a pressure of about 4 atmospheres; then it passes into the
second cylinder, whence it is forced into the accumulators under a
pressure varying from 10 to 12 atmospheres.

For a not very large production, the small pump suffices. This
has a single compressing cylinder connected directly with the
piston rod, upon which acts the steam coming from the boiler, K.
This pump compresses the gas to a pressure of 10 atmospheres, and
is capable of storing seven cubic meters of it per hour.

The carburets of hydrogen which separate in a liquid state
through the effect of the compression of the gas are retained in a
cylindrical receptacle, V, which is located between the pump and
the accumulators, T.

Besides the necessary safety apparatus, there is disposed in
front of the condensers a special valve, N, which allows the gas to
escape into the air if the retorts or the purifying apparatus get
choked up.

When the oil gas is not compressed it possesses an illuminating
power four times greater than that obtained from coal gas; and,
while the latter loses the greater part of its luminous power by
compression, the former loses only an eighth. It is this property
that renders the oil gas eminently fitted for lighting cars, and it
is for this reason that several large European railway companies
have adopted it.

APPLICATION TO CARS.

We show in the accompanying engravings the mode of installation
that the inventor has finally adopted for railway purposes. Each
car is furnished, perpendicularly to its length, with a reservoir,
a, containing the supply of gas under a pressure of 6 or 7
atmospheres. The gas is introduced into this reservoir by means of
a valve, which is put in communication with the mouths of supply
pipes placed along a platform. The pipes are provided with a
stopcock and their mouths are closed by a cap. To fill the car
reservoir it is only necessary to connect the mouths of the supply
pipes with the valves of the cars by means of rubber tubing--an
operation which takes about one minute for each car.

LIGHTING OF RAIWAY CARS

When it is necessary to supply cars at certain points where
there are no gas works, there is attached to the train a special
car on which are placed two or three accumulators, which thus
transport a supply of the compressed gas to distances that are
often very far removed from the source of supply.

The reservoir of each car, containing a certain supply of gas,
communicates with a regulator, b, the importance of which we
scarcely need point out. This apparatus consists: (1) of a
cast-iron cup, A, closed at the top by a membrane, B, which is
impervious to gas; (2) of a rod, C, connected at one end with the
membrane, and at the other with a lever, D; (3) of a regulating
valve resting on the lever, and of a spring, E, which renders the
internal mechanism independent of the motions of the car. The
lever, acting for the opening and closing of the valve, serves to
admit gas into the regulator through the aperture, F. This latter
is so calculated as to allow the passage of a quantity of gas
corresponding to a pressure of 16 millimeters. As soon as such a
pressure is reached in the regulator, the membrane rises and acts
on the lever, and the latter closes the valve. When the pressure
diminishes, as a consequence of the consumption of gas, the spring,
E, carries the lever to its initial position and another admission
of gas takes place. Communication between the regulator and the
lamps is effected by means of a pipe, z, of 7 millimeters diameter
(provided with a cock, d, which permits of extinguishing all the
lamps at once, and by special branches for each lamp. The lamps
used differ little in external form from those at present employed.
The body is of cast-iron; the cover, funnel, and chimney are of
tin; and the burner is of steatite. The products of combustion are
led outside through a flattened chimney, t, resting at o on the
center of the reflector. The air enters through the cover of the
lamp and reaches the interior through a series of apertures in the
circumference of the cast-iron bell which supports the reflector.
There is no communication whatever between the interior of the lamp
and the interior of the car, and thus there is no danger of
passengers being annoyed by the odor of gas. By means of a peculiar
apparatus, f, the flame may be reduced to a minimum without being
extinguished. This arrangement is at the disposition of the
conductor or within reach of the passengers. For facilitating
cleaning, the lamps are arranged so as to turn on a hinge-joint, m;
so that, on removing the reflector, o, it is only necessary to
raise the arm that carries the burner, r in order to clean the
base, s, without any difficulty.

On several railways both the palace and postals cars are also
heated by compressed oil gas; and lately an application has been
made of the gas for supplying the headlights of locomotives (see
figure), and for the signals placed at the rear of trains. But one
of the most interesting applications of oil is that of

LIGHTING BUOYS,

in which case it is compressed into large reservoirs placed on a
boat. The buoys employed are generally of from 90 to 285 cubic feet
capacity, affording a lighting for from 35 to 100 days.

To the upper part of the buoy there is affixed a firmly
supported tube carrying at its extremity the lantern, c. The gas
compressed to 6 or 7 atmospheres in the body of the buoy passes,
before reaching the burner, into a regulator analogous to the one
installed on railway cars, but modified in such a way as to operate
with regularity whatever be the inclination of the buoy. In the
section showing the details of the lantern on a large scale the
direction taken by the air is indicated by arrows, as is also the
direction taken by the products of combustion. These latter escape
at m, through apertures in the cap of the apparatus.

"COMPRESSED OIL GAS FOR LIGHTING CARS STEAMBOTS, AND BUOYS.">


COMPRESSED OIL GAS FOR LIGHTING CARS STEAMBOTS, AND
BUOYS.

The regulator, B, in the interior of the lantern, brings to a
uniform pressure the inclosed gas, whose pressure continues
diminishing as a consequence of the consumption. The lantern is
protected against wind and waves by very thick convex glasses set
into metallic cross-bars, c. The flame is located in the focus of a
Fresnel lens, b, consisting of superposed prismatic rings, and
adjusted at its lower part with a circle, d, while a conical ring,
e makes a joint at its other extremity. This ring is held by the
top piece of the lantern through the intermedium of six spiral
springs, c' c''. Under the focus of the flame there is placed a
conical reflector of German silver, t.

The buoy is filled through an aperture, k, in the side of the
upper tube. This aperture is provided with a valve which allows of
the buoy being charged by connecting it with the accumulators
located on a boat built especially for this service. As soon as the
gas reaches 6 or 7 atmospheres the cocks of the buoy and reservoir
are closed, and the connecting tube is removed. The consumption of
gas in the lantern is. 1,230 cubic inches per hour. This being
known it is very easy to calculate from the capacity of the buoy
how often it is necessary to charge it.

A large number of buoys on the Pintsch system are already in
use.

The oil gas is likewise applicable to the illumination of
lighthouses, and among those that are now being lighted in that way
we may cite the one in the port of Pillau, near K&ouml;nigsberg.
Several large steamers are likewise being lighted on this plan. In
such an application of oil gas the management of the apparatus is
very easy, and the permanence of the illuminating power of the gas
gives every facility for the lighting of the boat, whatever be the
duration of the trip.

Although Mr. Pintsch's process of manufacture has been but
recently introduced into France, it has received a number of
applications that permits us to foresee the future that is in store
for it. The Railway Company of the West has contracted for the
lighting of 250 first-class cars that run within the precincts of
the city; the State Railways have 56 cars lighted in this way
running between Nantes and Bordeaux and between Saintes and
Limoges; and the Line of the East has just applied the system to 80
of its cars.




DELICATE TEST FOR OXYGEN.

T. W. Engelmann proposes, in the Botanische Zeitung, a
new test, of an extremely delicate nature, for determining the
presence of very minute quantities of oxygen, namely: its power of
exciting the motility of bacteria. If any of the smaller species,
especially Bacterium termo, are brought to rest, and then
introduced into a fluid in which there is the minutest trace of
free oxygen, they will immediately begin to move about freely; and
if the oxygen is gradually introduced, their motion will be set up
only in those parts of the drop which the oxygen reaches. In this
way Engelmann was able to determine the evolution of oxygen by
Euglena and by chlorophyl granules.




DETERMINATION OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF ARSENIC IN SULPHUR.

By H SCH&AElig;PPI.

Ten grms. of sulphur, pulverized as finely as possible, are
covered with hot water and a few drops of nitric acid digested for
some time, filtered, and washed till the washings have no longer an
acid reaction. Thus calcium chloride and sulphate are removed, and
calcium sulphide, if present, is destroyed. The sulphur thus
prepared is covered with water at 70&deg; to 80&deg;, a few drops
of ammonia are added, and the mixture is digested for a quarter of
an hour. All the arsenic present as sulphide is dissolved, and the
ammoniacal liquid is variously treated according to the degree of
accuracy required. For perfectly accurate determinations the
ammoniacal solution is mixed with silver nitrate, and all the
sulphur present in the state of arsenic sulphide is thrown down as
silver sulphide, acidified with nitric acid, filtered, and washed.
The precipitate of silver sulphide is dissolved in hot nitric acid
and determined as silver chloride. From the weight of the latter
the arsenic sulphide is calculated. As a less accurate but more
rapid method, the ammoniacal solution of arsenic sulphide is
cautiously neutralized with pure dilute nitric acid and
considerably diluted. It is then titrated with decinormal silver
nitrate till a drop of the solution is turned brown with neutral
chromate. The arsenic is easily calculated from the quantity of
silver nitrate consumed. For very rough determinations it is
sufficient to treat ten grms. of finely-ground sulphur with nitric
acid, to extract with ammonia, and to add silver nitrate. From the
intensity of the color, or the quantity of the precipitate of
silver sulphide, it may be judged if the sulphur is approximately
free from arsenic or strongly contaminated. The author states that,
contrary to the general belief, reddish yellow sulphur is more free
from arsenic than such as is of a full yellow color.




HOW TO PLANT TREES.

By N. ROBERTSON, Government Grounds, Ottawa.

A great deal has been written and said about tree planting. Some
advise one way, some another. I will give you my method, with which
I have been very successful, and, as it differs somewhat from the
usual mode, may be interesting to some of your readers. I go into
the woods, select a place where it is thick with strong, young,
healthy, rapid growing trees. I commence by making a trench across
so as I will get as many as I want. I may have to destroy some
until I get a right start. I then undermine, taking out the trees
as I advance; this gives me a chance not to destroy the roots. I
care nothing about the top, because I cut them into what is called
poles eight or ten feet long. Sometimes I draw them out by hitching
a team when I can get them so far excavated that I can turn them
down enough to hitch above where I intend to cut them off; by this
method I often get almost the entire root. I have three particular
points in this; good root, a stem without any blemish, and a rapid
growing tree. This is seldom to be got where most people recommend
trees to be taken from--isolated ones on the outside of the woods;
they are generally scraggy and stunted; and to get their roots you
would have to follow along way to get at the fibers on their
points, without which they will have a hard struggle to live.
Another point recommended is to plant so that the tree will stand
in the direction it was before being moved; that I never think
about, but always study to have the longest and most roots on the
side where the wind will be strongest, which is generally the west,
on an open exposure.

For years I was much against this system of cutting trees into
poles, and fought hard against one of the most successful tree
planters in Canada about this pole business. I have trees planted
under the system described that have many strong shoots six and
eight feet long--hard maple, elm, etc., under the most unfavorable
circumstances. In planting, be particular to have the hole into
which you plant much larger than your roots; and be sure you draw
out all your roots to their length before you put on your soil;
clean away all the black, leafy soil about them, for if that is
left, and gets once dry, you will not easily wet it again. Break
down the edges of your holes as you progress, not to leave them as
if they were confined in a flower pot; and when finished, put
around them a good heavy mulch, I do not care what of--sawdust,
manure, or straw. This last you can keep by throwing a few
spadefuls of soil over; let it pass out over the edges of your
holes at least one foot.

I have no doubt that the best time to plant is the fall, as, if
left till spring, the trees are too far advanced before the frost
is put of the ground; and by fall planting the soil gets settled
about the roots, and they go on with the season.

Trees cut like poles have another great advantage. For the first
season they require no stakes to guard against the wind shaking
them, which is a necessity with a top; for depend upon it, if your
tree is allowed to sway with the wind, your roots will take very
little hold that season, and may die, often the second year, from
this very cause.

All who try this system will find out that they will get a much
prettier headed tree, and much sooner see a tree of beauty than by
any other, as, when your roots have plenty of fibrous roots, and
are in vigorous health, three years will give you nice
trees.--The Canadian Horticulturist.




THE GROWTH OF PALMS.

In a paper (Russian) recently read before the Botanical Section
of the St. Petersburg Natural History Society, Mr. K. Friderich
describes in detail the anatomical structures to be met with in the
aerial roots of Acanthorhiza aculeata, these roots
presenting a remarkable example of roots being metamorphosed into
spines. Supplementing this, E. Regel made the following
remarks:

Palm trees, grown from seed, thicken their stems for a
succession of years, like bulbs, only at the base. Many palms
continue this primary growth (i.e., the growth they first started
with) for fifty to sixty years before they form their trunk. During
this time new roots are always being developed at the base of the
stem, in whorls, and these always above the old roots. This even
takes place in old specimens, especially in those planted in the
open ground which have already formed a trunk, In such cases the
cortex layer, where the roots break through, is sprung off. In
conservatories, under the influence of the damp air, this root
formation, on which indeed the further normal growth of the palm
depends, takes place without any special assistance. When the palm
is grown in a sitting room, one must surround the base of the trunk
with moss, which is to be kept damp, in order to favor the
development of the roots. When the base of the palm trunk has
almost reached its normal thickness, then begins the upward
development of the trunk, which takes place more slowly in those
species whose leaves grow close together than in those whose leaves
are further apart. In specimens of many species of Cocos and
Syagrus, whose leaves are particularly far apart, the stems grow so
quickly when planted in the open ground that they increase by five
to six feet in height per annum. The stem of those palms which
develop a terminal inflorescence have ended their apical growth by
doing so, and wither gradually, In addition to this (withering) in
the case, e.g. of Arenga saccharifera, new inflorescences
are developed from the original axils (Blattachseln) from
above downward, so that one sees at last the already leafless trunk
still developing inflorescences in the direction toward the base of
the trunk. Almost all palms with this latter kind of growth develop
offshoots in their youth at the base of their trunks, which shoot
up again into trunks after the death of the primary trunk, if they
are not taken off before. As to the structure of the palm trunks
out of unconnected wood bundles, the assertion has been made that
the palm stem does not grow thicker in the course of time, and that
this is the explanation of the columnar almost evenly thick trunk.
But careful measurements that were made for years have led Regel to
the conclusion that a thickening of the trunk actually takes place,
which probably amounts to an increase of about a third over the
original circumference of the trunk.




THE FUTURE OF SILK CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES.

Report by CONSUL PEIXOTTO, of Lyons.

In my dispatch, No. 140, dated September 1, 1880, I referred to
the fact that new machinery for reeling silk had been invented,
which, in my opinion, was destined to be of great importance, and
to make this industry extremely valuable and profitable in our
country. I beg now to submit some additional observations upon this
subject, and for the purpose of being definite, to entitle them

THE FUTURE OF SILK CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES.

Silk reeling is at present accomplished by the use of appliances
which differ only in detail from those in use many centuries ago,
and which can scarcely be called machines, being rather of the
nature of apparatus depending entirely upon the skill and knowledge
of the operative for the results produced. In fact, even the most
perfect of French and Italian reels bear about the same relation to
automatic machinery that an old-fashioned spinning wheel does to
our modern spinning machines.

Since the date of my previous dispatch upon this subject, the
new reeling machine of Mr. E. W. Serrell, jr., of New York (who
still continues in Lyons), has been undergoing improvement and
development, and it is with the hope of facilitating the
introduction and culture of silk, and of enabling our people to
adopt the best means to that end, and to avoid errors which have
been disastrous in the past and are likely to be extremely
expensive in the near future, that I now communicate with the
department, which is equally interested in securing new sources of
industry and wealth for our people at home as for the promotion and
extension of their commerce abroad.

It will be recollected that from about 1834 to 1839 there raged
a great speculation in mulberry trees of a certain species
(Morus multicaulis) destined for feeding silk worms. This
speculation led to a total loss of all the time and money devoted
to it, partly because of its wild and utterly unsound character,
and partly because the little silk which was actually produced
could not be reeled to advantage. As a result, silk culture fell
into utter disrepute and for nearly a generation was scarcely
thought of as a practical thing in the United States. Time,
however, showed clearly where the great obstacle lay, and although
many may have imagined that other difficulties led to its
abandonment in 1839-40, those who have studied the matter are
unanimously of the opinion that the want of reeling machinery has
alone prevented the success of sericulture in those parts of the
Union which are suitable for it. Believing this obstacle to be
removed, it remains to set forth in a brief manner some of the
points upon which, it appears to me, the successful introduction of
silk raising will depend.

For the success of silk culture in our country two things are
now requisite--the acquisition on the part of those about to engage
in it of sound knowledge of its processes and requirements, and
proper organization.

The details of the work of silk culture are of such a nature
that they may be readily understood, and I apprehend that there
will be little difficulty found by those who engage in it in
mastering them, after some little experience. The point at which it
seems to me that there is the most danger is at the very
beginning.

In order to avoid delays and losses, the person who begins silk
culture should have a pretty clear idea of the scale of operations
which are likely to be most profitable; of the trees, or rather
shrubs, which must be obtained; of the apparatus and fixtures
necessary, and of the results which may be reasonably expected from
the labor and expense required. All of these items will be found to
vary in different parts of the country, and I fear that general
rules, broad deductions, and such information as would apply under
all circumstances and in all places would be extremely difficult to
formulate, and too vague for practical use at any given point.

In fact, as far as information which may be considered perfectly
general is concerned, I have, for the time being, only one point to
put forward in addition to what has already been published in the
United States, which is to repeat and show as emphatically as
possible that the use of the reels at present employed for the
filature of silk is entirely impracticable in our country, and that
the raiser must sell his cocoons.

This has been so often said and so clearly shown that I should
consider it unnecessary to repeat it had not my attention been
called to the fact that the success of several people and
associations in the United States in raising cocoons has again made
it a temptation to endeavor to reel silk, and during the past year
I have received applications from people in different States for
information as to the kind of silk reel employed here which would
be most suitable for use by them.

I am aware, also, that estimates have been made and published by
some eminent authorities tending to show that this work could be
done on a paying basis in some places in America. So far as I have
seen them, however, these estimates are fatally defective in that
they do not allow for differences in quality of silk reeled by
competent or incompetent people, and under circumstances favorable
or otherwise, but seem to assume that any silk reeled in our
country would be a first rate article, and paid for
accordingly.

While this might be true in isolated cases, it could not be true
in general, as with present appliances the art of reeling
good silk is only to be acquired and retained by years of
apprenticeship and constant practice joined to a natural talent for
the work. So true is this, that even in districts where the work
has been largely carried on for many generations, quite a large
proportion of women who try for years find it impossible to become
good reelers.

Now, there is a considerable difference in price between well
reeled and poorly reeled silk--a difference so great that silk not
well reeled in every way is not worth as much as the cocoons from
which it is derived. It is, therefore, quite a hopeless task to
reel silk unless the reeler is skilled. Even if it could be done to
advantage--which I do not think it could--there exists in America
no means of training reelers. In Europe they are taught by degrees
in the filatures, working first at the easier stages of the
operations, and afterward being helped forward under the eyes and
guidance of experienced operatives.

Another grave defect in the estimates alluded to is that all the
profit is assumed to be paid to the reeler. This can evidently only
be the case when each reeler runs her own reel, owns and cares for
her own cocoons, sells her own silk, and furnishes her own capital.
Now, even supposing that persons so fortunately placed as to be
able to fulfill all these conditions should wish to engage in silk
reeling, which is in the highest degree improbable, there exists an
almost insuperable obstacle to the production of good silk except
by an establishment large enough to use the cocoons of many
producers.

Nearly every silk crop as raised by the individual growers
contains three or four grades of cocoons, and to produce good and
uniform silk, these must be separated and each sort reeled by
itself, producing several grades of silk.

Without going into detail, it is enough to say that this is not
practical for those who attempt to reel their own cocoons, and that
for this reason, and many others, hand reels and single basins have
been nearly abandoned even in Italy; the women finding so much
difficulty that they prefer to sell their cocoons and work in large
establishments where the work is done to more advantage.

It is evident, therefore, that, from the estimates made, there
should be a considerable deduction for poor workmanship, and
another for use of capital, organization, selling expenses,
superintendence, insurance, repairs, deterioration, etc. In fact, I
do not see in what way the reeling of silk in the United States, by
the ordinary method, could be made to bear a much higher charge for
labor than that borne by European filatures, which barely pay with
labor at one franc per diem of thirteen hours.

To be able, then, to reel silk by the ordinary reels, it would
first be necessary to find a sufficiency of highly skilled
operatives willing to labor in a factory thirteen hours per day for
twenty cents each. I sincerely believe and hope that this can never
be done. I have enlarged somewhat upon this difficulty for the
purpose of showing that the growers, or at any rate individual
growers of cocoons, should not attempt to do the reeling, but by no
means with an idea of discouraging the raising of silk worms, which
is and should be an entirely separate matter. To use a rough
comparison, I should esteem it as wasteful, even if possible, for
each grower to attempt to reel his own cocoons as for each farmer
to grind his own wheat upon his farm and endeavor to sell the
flour.

It is, therefore, clear that the object of the sericulturist
should be to raise and market as good a crop of cocoons as possible
to the best advantage, and with the least possible expense and
risk.

After what has been said, it may be very properly asked, if,
seeing that the hopes which have been entertained of reeling by the
usual method have proved fallacious, and as no radically new system
of raising silk worms is under consideration, it is not very
possible that all hopes of profit from rearing the worm may prove
fallacious also.

In fact, not only has the question been asked, but an argument
of great apparent strength and much plausibility has been
formulated and extensively circulated, tending to show that the
difficulty of cheap labor, which it has been shown stood in the way
of reeling without improved machinery, will make the raising of
cocoons also a hopelessly unprofitable task.

Briefly summarized, this argument may be stated as follows:

First. To raise silk worms to advantage much time and attention
are required.

Second. Time and attention are more costly in the United States
than in other countries.

Third. Consequently, cocoons can be more cheaply raised in other
countries than in the United States.

Fourth. The United States possess no special advantages as a
market for cocoons, and therefore they must be sold as cheaply as
elsewhere, and the labor costing more, there is less profit.

Fifth. The profits made by raisers in Europe are not very great,
and as they would be less in the United States, it is not worth
while to try to raise cocoons in that country.

It must be acknowledged that upon the surface this all appears
to be very sound and almost unanswerable, but I hope to be able to
show that there is in reality not the slightest real foundation for
the conclusion to which this argument points.

Taking the points cited in order, I would say, as regards the
first and second, that although labor and time are required to
raise cocoons, I am convinced that the labor and time of the kind
necessary will not be found more expensive in our country than in
Europe, for the following reasons:

The work is a home industry. It can be carried on without severe
manual labor except for a few days, at the end of the season, when
large crops are raised.

Now, nothing is better known than that there exists in many of
our States an enormous number of wives and daughters of country
people of a class entirely different from any to be found
elsewhere, except, perhaps, to a limited extent, in England. I
refer to the "well-to-do" but not wealthy agricultural and
manufacturing classes in small villages.

One or two generations ago the farmers' and mechanics' wives and
daughters found plenty of work in spinning, weaving, dyeing,
cutting, and making the linen and clothes of the family. This has
entirely ceased as a domestic industry with the exception of the
"sewing" of the women's clothes and men's underwear. As a
consequence, the women of the family are condemned to idleness, or
to the drudgery of the whole household work.

Upon a proper occasion I think that much might be said of the
evils and dangers which are likely within a short time to arise
from the fact that perhaps a large majority of American women find
themselves, because of the present organization of society and
industry, almost unable to contribute to the family income except
by going away from home, or in doing the most menial and severe
labor as household workers from one end of the year to the other. I
shall at present, however, only point out that in hundreds of
thousands of homes in the country an opportunity of gaining a very
moderate sum in addition to the present income by the expenditure
of some weeks of care and light work would be hailed as a Godsend,
and that, too, in families where the feeling of self-respect and
the desire to keep the family together are far too strong to permit
the women to go away from home in any way to earn money.

Let any one who doubts this consider the dairy work and similar
industries, and try to calculate how much per diem the women thus
occupied at home gain in money. It may be said with entire accuracy
that, as a rule, anything in which the women can engage at home, by
which something may be earned, will in general be regarded as net
profit through out many sections of the land. In the silk districts
of Europe, agricultural machinery is very much less employed than
with us, and in general every woman who can possibly be spared from
other work is a field laborer and valuable as such. So that time
taken for raising silk must be deducted from her other productive
work and charged to the cost of the silk crop. I think that there
can be no doubt that this one fact is quite sufficient to make the
question of the cost of caring for the worms really as much in
favor of the United States as at first glance it appears to be the
other way; it being the case that in our country many who would be
glad to do the work have spare time to give to it, whereas in
Europe every hour that is given to silk worms would otherwise be
spent in the field.

In the South there are very large masses of inhabitants who are
unable to work in the fields, both men and women, and who would
also find in a yearly crop of silk worms a very comfortable
addition to their yearly gains, and one which could be derived from
time not otherwise convertible into money. Land is very much
dearer, and taxes are higher in the European silk districts than
with us, and every little crop of cocoons has to pay its share,
which adds a considerable percentage to its cost.

The buildings possessed by peasants and used for the raising of
silk worms are, in general, small, close, and miserable. Throughout
America the roomy barns which are empty at the cocoon season, will,
with little preparation, be much preferable, and enable the raisers
to work to very much better advantage.

In Europe diseases of several kinds have become more or less
prevalent, and in some cases have diminished the production of
whole districts.

Notwithstanding the fact that many experiments have been made in
America, and in Georgia particularly, and silk has been raised
continuously for over a century, these diseases (maladies des
vers a soile) have never made their appearance.

The people of our country are, as a rule, much better educated
than those in Southern France and Italy, and will undoubtedly use
their intelligence in such a way as to derive a benefit from it,
and economize their labor by proper appliances, etc.

Taking all these facts into consideration, I am convinced that
that there will be no difficulty in raising cocoons for the same
cost in labor in the United States as in Europe, and I am inclined
to think that the work can be much more cheaply done.

It is true that the United States is not an especially good
market for cocoons; in fact up to this time there has been scarcely
any market at all for them; but with the organization of the
industry and the introduction of reeling machinery, the market will
be at least as good there as elsewhere. As to whether it will be
"worth while" for our people to raise silk worms, I would say that
though the amount of money to be paid by any one family is
certainly not very large, it is nearly all clear profit, and under
the circumstances which I have above pointed out, and which exist
so generally, I am sure that the sum to be realized will be
regarded as very important by a vast number of people. As in other
points, it is extremely difficult to make any exact estimates on
such a subject which would be generally applicable to a country so
large and so various in climate, soil, and social habit as ours. I
am inclined to think, however, that were the members of an average
family, under average circumstances, to raise a crop of cocoons,
the amount which could be advantageously reared should produce,
according to circumstances, from seventy-five to two hundred
dollars. Scarcely any "paying" result can be hoped for, however,
without more or less organization of the work, as sericulture is an
industry which is very sensitive to the evils of a want of proper
co-operation among those who carry on its various processes. After
some reflection, I am of the opinion that individual growers will
have great difficulty in selling cocoons if they are isolated from
others, and I therefore doubt the wisdom of encouraging sporadic
and ill-directed efforts, which, however well meant and earnestly
pursued, are much more apt to end in disappointment,
discouragement, and discredit to the newly developing industry than
in anything else. It seems to me to be neither wise nor fair to
furnish estimates of returns, which presuppose an organization of
the industry, without mentioning the difficulties which must be
encountered where the organization is lacking. The great difficulty
is in selling the cocoons after they are raised, and this can only
be practically overcome by such a development of the culture as
will result in the production, within the limits of a given
neighborhood, of sufficient quantities of cocoons to make it
practicable to prepare and forward them to market. It is as well
known as any other fact in trade, that small transactions are much
more costly in proportion than large ones, and this general rule is
especially applicable to the cocoon market. The product of two or
three isolated families in the interior of our country could not be
marketed to advantage. Whereas, were several hundreds engaged on
the work in the same vicinity the charge of marketing their joint
crop would be only a small percentage of its value.

Silk raising is the work of an organized people, and before it
can become successful in our country must possess proper channels
for its trade, just as much as wool, or cotton, or wheat. The
machinery of this organization, however, need not be either
complicated or expensive. What is required is a system of nuclei in
towns or large villages, which may serve as centers of information
and as gathering receptacles for the crops of surrounding
producers.

The details of organization must be left, and I think may safely
be left to the good sense of the people of different sections, who
will work out the problem in different ways, according to their
different circumstances. Even were the need of organization not
made evident to those undertaking sericulture in the beginning, it
would soon become so, as it has, in fact, in several parts of the
country. I have therefore deemed it proper to call attention to
this matter, on the principle that a "stitch in time saves nine." I
am informed that there exist already in the United States several
associations devoted to acquiring and disseminating knowledge of
the art of sericulture. This is a very great step in the right
direction, and cannot be too heartily commended. If conducted with
prudence and wisdom these societies will be of great service, and I
would respectfully suggest that any encouragement which the
government may think proper to afford would in all probability be
extremely useful and profitable to the country in the future.
Provided, always, that such societies are really devoted to the
dissemination of information and the careful organization of the
industry, and are not merely visionary and impractical cultivators
of misapplied enthusiasm.

It would, I think, be of importance so far as possible, to
direct the attention of county and State agricultural societies,
"village improvement clubs," and in general the intelligent and
careful portion of our rural population to this matter. It is
beyond doubt that the time when sericulture can be begun and
carried on profitably in our country has arrived. Its successful
introduction would result in a very important yearly revenue and
increase in the public wealth, for I think that within a
comparatively few years it could be made to be worth at least fifty
or sixty millions of dollars per annum, and perhaps much more.
This, however, is a less advantage than the fact that by supplying
a new home industry it would do much toward conserving home ties
and interests, and thereby help to strengthen and perpetuate good
morals and home living among our people.




THE HIBERNATION OF ANIMALS.

"Don't black bears sleep through the winter?" questioned the
writer of an attendant who was dealing out mid-day rations of bread
and milk at the park.

"That's the general impression," was the rejoinder, "but we have
never noticed any attempts at hibernation here. Bears are unusually
lively during the cold months, and demand their food as regularly
as do the lions and other feline animals. I don't know that any
observations of value on this question have ever been made on
animals in confinement. I have had some experience with outside
animals, and a great many go through what is called a winter's
sleep; and in warm countries there is what might be called a summer
sleep. Bears begin in the fall to look out for a soft nest; and if
it's possible for them to eat more at one time than another they do
it then, and when the cold weather sets in they are fat and in
prime condition. According to some authorities, the fat produces
the carbon that in some way tends to induce somnolency. The stomach
of a bear at this time becomes empty, and naturally shrivels or
draws into a very small space, and is rendered totally useless by a
substance called 'tappen' that clogs it and the intestines; this is
formed of pine leaves and other material that the animal takes from
ants' nest and the trunks of trees in its search after honey. They
lie asleep in this condition for about six months, generally snowed
in; but you can tell the place, as the heat of the bear, what there
is left, keeps an air hole up through the snow. The bear seems to
live on its fat, the tappen preventing its too rapid consumption;
and if you run across them during this time--even along in March
just before they wake up--they are about as fat as when they went
in. I have taken a slice of fat from a black bear six inches
thick--regular blubber. I remember," continued the man, "one winter
I was 'log hauling' in the western part of this State. We had our
eyes on a big tree, and one morning when it was about ten degrees
below zero I tackled it to warm up. I hammered away for about five
hours at it and finally started her, and over she came--slowly at
first, and then as if she was going right through. The snow was
nearly three feet deep, and as the tree struck it flew up for about
twenty feet and half blinded me, and when I came to there was the
biggest black bear I ever saw standing along side of me, looking
about as mixed as I did. I had lost my ax, and the first move I
made she started, and on taking a look I found that she had a nest
in the trunk and had probably turned in for the winter. It was
about twenty feet from the ground, and was built with moss, leaves,
and all kinds of truck, and as warm and as snug as you please--a
good place to spend a winter in."

The brown and polar bears have the same habit of lying up for
the winter. An Esquimau informed Captain Lyon that in the first of
the winter the pregnant bears are always fat and solitary. When a
heavy fall of snow sets in the animal seeks some hollow place in
which she can lie down, and remains quiet while the snow covers
her. Sometimes she will wait until a quantity of snow has fallen
and then digs herself a cave; at all events it seems necessary that
she should be covered up by the snow. She now goes to sleep and
does not wake until the spring sun is pretty high, when she brings
forth two cubs. The cave by this time has become much larger by the
effect of the animal's warmth and breath, so that the cubs have
room enough to move, and they acquire considerable strength by
continually sucking. The dam at length becomes so thin and weak
that it is with great difficulty she extricates herself, which she
does when the sun is powerful enough to throw a strong glare
through the snow which roofs the den. Then the family comes out,
and will take anything that comes along in the way of food. During
the long sleep the temperature of the bear's blood is reduced to
almost that of the surrounding air. The power of will over the
muscles seems to be suspended, respiration is hardly noticeable,
and most of the vital functions are at a complete standstill--the
entire body sleeping, as it were. The male grizzly bear never
hibernates. The young and the females, however, build nests, one of
which measured ten feet high, five feet long, and six feet
wide.

Bats are great winter sleepers, and in most of the known caves
they can be found during the cold months clinging to the walls and
to each other. During hibernation their respiration ceases almost
entirely, and only the most careful use of a stethoscope can reveal
it. The air that has surrounded numbers of them has been carefully
examined and not the slightest evidence found of its having been
breathed; and, stranger yet, they can exist in this condition in
gas, that, were they awake, would prove instantly fatal. A machine
has been invented to examine these and other animals while in this
condition. A delicate index records the slightest pulsation, while
a thermometer shows the rise and fall of the temperature at every
moment during the period; and by an arrangement of the wing, the
circulation of the blood is recorded. A more delicate experiment
can hardly be imagined, as a strong breath, a sneeze, or a footfall
will cause the subject of the experiment to recover enough to
respire several times; and the effect of this on the machine can be
imagined when it is known that though, while in this condition,
they produce no effect upon the oxygen of the air about them, they
consume when respiring more than four cubic inches of oxygen an
hour.

The common marmot is a great underground sleeper. They build
large storehouses, sometimes eight feet in diameter, and from the
latter part of September to April they lie in them, and, like the
bears, give birth to their young during this period.

The dormouse is a remarkable sleeper. Even in their ordinary
sleep they can be taken from the nest and handled without waking
them. Toward winter they acquire a great deal of fat, and stow away
a vast amount of provision around about their nest, and then go to
sleep within; but they rarely awake to use this food unless a very
warm period comes around before the regular breaking up of cold
weather.

The hedgehog is a sound winter sleeper, and has been the subject
of an infinite number of experiments while in this condition. One
experimentalist, believing that cold was the cause of their curious
condition, surrounded one with a freezing mixture, and froze it to
death. By increasing the cold about another that was already
hibernating, it was made to wake up; and walked off.

If an animal is suddenly decapitated while in this hibernating
condition, the action of the heart is not affected for some time, a
second life seeming to outlive the one taken. An experiment has
been made in which the brain of the sleeper was removed, then the
entire spinal cord, but for two hours hardly any change was
noticeable upon the action of the heart; and a day after that organ
contracted when touched by the operator.

The writer has the winter nest of a family of ants. A piece of
fence rail was found beneath an old pile of boards and brought into
a warm room for the sake of a rich fungus growing upon it, and
several hours after the table and chairs were found to be covered
with ants. Where they came from was a mystery, until the old rail
was accidentally jarred and a number fell from it. A section was
cut down through it, and the winter home of the tribe
destroyed--probably the work of weeks, perhaps months. The interior
of the wood was completely riddled by tunnels and passages, some
being large and holding several hundred ants, while others
contained only a few. In some of the interior passages the ants had
not been affected by the heat, and were packed in great masses and
evidently fast asleep; they soon recovered, however, and walked off
slowly in different directions, as if wondering if an earthquake or
spring had come.

A great number of insects go through a period of hibernation,
especially spiders. The young of the latter are often covered by
the parent; first, by coarse strings of silk, as if to hold them in
place, and then by a white, silvery web worked over them, which
forms probably a sure protection from wind and weather.

The writer has a cherry-stone in which is coiled up an insect,
best known as the sowbug. A squirrel had probably eaten out the
meat and opened the way, and in this snug retreat we found the
little hibernater snugly rolled up, as is also its habit when
alarmed. The mouth of the hole was stopped by black soil, but
whether from accident or by the animal itself we could not
tell.

Some fishes and reptiles are hibernaters. Frogs and toads sleep
out the winter at the bottom of ponds or in holes in the ground.
Tree toads, if kept in a cage in the winter and provided with soil,
will endeavor to cover themselves with it, showing how strong the
instinct or habit is. Some fishes are so insensible to heat or cold
that when in this condition they can be frozen and carried for a
number of days and then be brought back to an active condition. The
pond snail passes into a winter sleep as soon as the temperature of
the water is below 14&deg; Cent., that is, they will not digest
food or grow until the temperature of the water is at least up to
15&deg; Cent. Those who have watched the Harlem River from McComb's
Dam Bridge cannot have failed to notice the curious appearance of
the muddy shores of the river and creeks at low tide. If the sun
shines brightly, the dismal beach seems to quiver and scintillate
in a most beautiful manner, reflecting the light like so many
diamonds. If we draw nearer, this shore is seen to be entirely
covered in places with little snails, that, left by the tide, are
forging through the mud to regain the water, and the sunlight
striking on them is reflected by the glass-like secretion with
which they are covered, producing the curious effect noticed. This
could be seen in the warm months, but now, not a snail of the
countless millions can be seen. They have gone down in search of
"hard-pan," there to hibernate until next April. The land snail
(Helix pomatia) sleeps four months during the year, and does
not throw off the calcareous lid that protects it during this time
until the day temperature has reached 12&deg; Cent. Prairie dogs
feel the effect of temperature as low as this.

In Cuba reptiles hibernate between 7&deg; and 24&deg; Cent.,
according to the species. In warmer countries, snakes, lizards,
frogs, etc., fall into a state called chill coma that precisely
resembles winter sleep, but their temperature is far above that at
which hibernating animals of the north are still active. The state
of hibernation is not the direct result of an extreme of heat or
cold, but rather is caused by a departure from the optimum. In the
snail its normal temperature is about the same as the water, and
being a poor heat producer it is not surprising that when the water
grows colder the animal is forced to succumb; but it is a
remarkable fact that warm-blooded animals like many of the
above-mentioned, whose bodies are maintained by internal processes
at a high temperature of 26&deg; to 38&deg;, are incapable of
resisting the lowering influence of cold. The fall in temperature
in some is wonderful; as an example, the high body temperature of
warm-blooded animals may be said to oscillate between 36&deg; and
43&deg; Cent. (this includes man). Experiments made with the zizel
show that during hibernation this animal's temperature is only
2&deg; Cent., the lowest known; and a thermometer introduced into
the animal indicated the same, showing that warm-blooded animals in
hibernating become truly cold blooded animals. If a rabbit's
temperature reaches 15&deg; Cent., it will die. The germs of
bryozoa or of the fresh water sponges resist any amount of cold,
but the full grown forms die at the first cold turn. Insects are
destroyed, but their eggs live, though of the greatest possible
delicacy. Salmon eggs have been carried from this State to
Australia, and there hatched. In fact, some animals live in the
ice, as the glacier flea and several others.

As it is not the direct result of extremes of heat or cold that
produces sleep, neither is the awakening from hibernation directly
caused by a rise of temperature. In experiments made upon weasels,
which are sometimes caught asleep, one came to life in about three
hours, during which the temperature of the room remained the same
as it had been during the entire hibernation, viz., 10&deg; Cent.
In another weasel, during the awakening, the body temperature rose
very rapidly--and more so in the second part of the period than in
the first. In the first hour and fifty-five minutes of the
awakening the body temperature rose 6.6&deg; Cent, and in the
following fifty minutes it rose 17&deg; Cent. This remarkable
increase took place without any vigorous movements on the part of
the weasel. Even its breathing showed no increase in proportion to
the rise. These cases show that though, at certain seasons, animals
relax as it were and lie dormant, and recover, seemingly at the
will of the weather, yet, in point of fact, the rise and fall of
temperature has no direct effect upon them. The cause is an
internal one, awaiting discovery.--C. F. HOLDER, in Forest and
Stream.


What is described as the largest steel sailing ship afloat was
lately launched at Belfast, Ireland. It registers 2,220 tons, and
has been named the Garfield. It will be employed in the Australian
and California trade.




THE TIDES.

London Nature, in a recent issue, says: From a scientific
point of view, the work done by the tides is of unspeakable
importance. Whence is this energy derived with which the tides do
their work? If the tides are caused by the moon, the energy they
possess must also be derived from the moon. This looks plain
enough, but unfortunately it is not true. Would it be true to
assert that the finger of the rifleman which pulls the trigger
supplies the energy with which the rifle bullet is animated? Of
course it would not. The energy is derived from the explosion of
gunpowder, and the pulling of the trigger is merely the means by
which that energy is liberated.

In somewhat similar manner the tidal wave produced by the moon
is the means whereby a part of the energy stored in the earth is
compelled to expend itself in work. Let me illustrate this by a
comparison between the earth rotating on its axis and the fly-wheel
of an engine: The fly wheel is a sort of reservoir, into which the
engine pours its power at each stroke of the piston. The various
machines in the mill merely draw off the power from the store
accumulated in the fly-wheel. The earth is like a gigantic
fly-wheel detached from the engine, though still connected with the
machines in the mill. In that mighty fly-wheel a stupendous
quantity of energy is stored up, and a stupendous quantity of
energy would be given out before that fly-wheel would come to rest.
The earth's rotation is a reservoir from whence the tides draw the
energy they require for doing work. Hence it is that though the
tides are caused by the moon, yet whenever they require energy they
draw on the supply ready to hand in the rotation of the earth. The
earth differs from the fly-wheel of an engine in a very important
point. As the energy is withdrawn from the fly-wheel by the
machines in the mill, so it is restored thereto by the power of the
steam engine, and the fly runs uniformly. But the earth is merely
the fly-wheel without the engine. When the work by the tides
withdraws energy from the earth, that energy is never restored. It,
therefore, follows that the earth's rotation must be decreasing.
This leads to a consequence of the most wonderful importance. It
tells us that the speed with which the earth rotates on its axis is
diminishing. We can state the result in a manner which has the
merits of simplicity and brevity. The tides are increasing the
length of the day. At present, no doubt, the effect of the tides in
changing the length of the day is very small. A day now is not
appreciably longer than a day a hundred years ago. Even in a
thousand years the change in the length of the day is only a
fraction of a second. But the importance arises from the fact that
the change, slow though it is, lies always in one direction. The
day is continually increasing. In millions of years the accumulated
effect becomes not only appreciable, but even of startling
magnitude.

The change in the length of the day must involve a corresponding
change in the motion of the moon. If the moon acts on the earth and
retards the rotation of the earth, so, conversely, does the earth
react upon the moon. The earth is tormented by the moon, so it
strives to drive away its persecutor. At present the moon revolves
around the earth at a distance of about 240,000 miles. The reaction
of the earth tends to increase this distance, and to force the moon
to revolve in an orbit which is continually growing larger and
larger. As thousands of years roll on, the length of the day
increases second by second, and the distance of the moon increases
mile by mile. A million years ago the day, probably, contained some
minutes less than our present day of twenty-four hours. Our
retrospect does not halt here; we at once project our view back to
an incredibly remote epoch which was a crisis in the history of our
system. It must have been at least 50,000,000 years ago. It may
have been very much earlier. This crisis was the interesting
occasion when the moon was born. The length of the day was only a
very few hours. If we call it three hours we shall not be far from
the truth. Purhaps you may think that if we looked back to a still
earlier epoch, the day would become still less, and finally
disappear altogether. This is, however, not the case. The day can
never have been much less than three hours in the present order of
things. Everybody knows that the earth is not a sphere, but there
is a protuberance at the equator, so that, as our school books tell
us, the earth is shaped like an orange. It is well known that this
protuberance is due to the rotation of the earth on its axis, by
which the equatorial parts bulge out by centrifugal force. The
quicker the earth rotates the greater is the protuberance. If,
however, the rate of rotation exceeds a certain limit, the
equatorial portion of the earth could no longer cling together. The
attraction which unites them would be overcome by centrifugal
force, and a general break up would occur. It can be shown that the
rotation of the earth, when on the point of rupture, corresponds to
a length of the day somewhere about the critical value of three
hours, which we have already adopted. It is, therefore, impossible
for us to suppose a day much shorter than three hours.

Let us leave the earth for a few minutes and examine the past
history of the moon. We have seen the moon revolve around the earth
in an ever-widening orbit, and consequently the moon must, in
ancient times, have been nearer the earth than it is now. No doubt
the change is slow. There is not much difference between the orbit
of the moon a thousand years ago and the orbit in which the moon is
now moving. But when we rise to millions of years, the difference
becomes very appreciable. Thirty or forty millions of years ago the
moon was much closer to the earth than it is at present; very
possibly the moon was then only half its present distance. We must,
however, look still earlier, to a certain epoch not less than fifty
million of years ago. At that epoch the moon must have been so
close to the earth that the two bodies were almost touching.
Everybody knows that the moon revolves now around the earth in a
period of twenty-seven days. The period depends upon the distance
between the earth and the moon. In earlier times the month must
have been shorter than our present month. Some millions of years
ago the moon completed its journey in a week instead of taking
twenty-eight days as at present. Looking back earlier still, we
find the month has dwindled down to a day, then down to a few
hours, until at that wondrous epoch when the moon was almost
touching the earth, the moon spun around the earth once every three
hours.

In those ancient times I see our earth to be a noble globe, as
it is as present. Yet it is not partly covered with oceans and
partly clothed with verdure. The primeval earth seems rather a
fiery and half-molten mass, where no organic life can dwell.
Instead of the atmosphere which we now have, I see a dense mass of
vapors in which perhaps, all the oceans of the earth are suspended
as clouds. I see that the sun still rises and sets to give the
succession of day and of night, but the day and the night together
only amounted to three hours, instead of twenty-four. Almost
touching the chaotic mass of the earth is another much smaller and
equally chaotic body. Around the earth I see this small body
rapidly rotating, the two revolving together, as if they were bound
by invisible bands. The smaller body is the moon.




DRILLING GLASS.

The Revue Industrielle gives the following method of
drilling holes in glass: First, prepare a saturated solution of gum
camphor in oil of turpentine. Then take a lance-shaped drill, heat
it to a white heat, and dip it into a bath of mercury, which will
render it extremely hard. When sharpened and dipped into the
above-named camphor solution, the tool will enter the glass as if
the latter were as soft as wood. If care be taken to keep the spot
being drilled constantly wet with the solution, the operation will
proceed rapidly, and there will rarely be any need of sharpening
the tool.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
