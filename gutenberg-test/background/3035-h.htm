    <h2>
      Chapter I. The Secession Movement
    </h2>
    <p>
      The secession movement had three distinct stages. The first, beginning
      with the news that Lincoln was elected, closed with the news, sent
      broadcast over the South from Charleston, that Federal troops had taken
      possession of Fort Sumter on the night of the 28th of December. During
      this period the likelihood of secession was the topic of discussion in the
      lower South. What to do in case the lower South seceded was the question
      which perplexed the upper South. In this period no State north of South
      Carolina contemplated taking the initiative. In the Southeastern and Gulf
      States immediate action of some sort was expected. Whether it would be
      secession or some other new course was not certain on the day of Lincoln's
      election. Various States earlier in the year had provided for conventions
      of their people in the event of a Republican victory. The first to
      assemble was the convention of South Carolina, which organized at
      Columbia, on December 17, 1860. Two weeks earlier Congress had met.
      Northerners and Southerners had at once joined issue on their relation in
      the Union. The House had appointed its committee of thirty-three to
      consider the condition of the country. So unpromising indeed from the
      Southern point of view had been the early discussions of this committee
      that a conference of Southern members of Congress had sent out their
      famous address To Our Constituents: "The argument is exhausted. All hope
      of relief in the Union... is extinguished, and we trust the South will not
      be deceived by appearances or the pretense of new guarantees. In our
      judgment the Republicans are resolute in the purpose to grant nothing that
      will or ought to satisfy the South. We are satisfied the honor, safety,
      and independence of the Southern people require the organization of a
      Southern Confederacy&mdash;a result to be obtained only by separate state
      secession." Among the signers of this address were the two statesmen who
      had in native talent no superiors at Washington&mdash;Judah P. Benjamin of
      Louisiana and Jefferson Davis of Mississippi.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal To Our Constituents was not the only assurance of support
      tendered to the convention of South Carolina. To represent them at this
      convention the governors of Alabama and Mississippi had appointed
      delegates. Mr. Hooker of Mississippi and Mr. Elmore of Alabama made
      addresses before the convention on the night of the 17th of December. Both
      reiterated views which during two days of lobbying they had disseminated
      in Columbia "on all proper occasions." Their argument, summed up in
      Elmore's report to Governor Moore of Alabama, was "that the only course to
      unite the Southern States in any plan of cooperation which could promise
      safety was for South Carolina to take the lead and secede at once without
      delay or hesitation... that the only effective plan of cooperation must
      ensue after one State had seceded and presented the issue when the plain
      question would be presented to the other Southern States whether they
      would stand by the seceding State engaged in a common cause or abandon her
      to the fate of coercion by the arms of the Government of the United
      States."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten years before, in the unsuccessful secession movement of 1850 and 1851,
      Andrew Pickens Butler, perhaps the ablest South Carolinian then living,
      strove to arrest the movement by exactly the opposite argument. Though
      desiring secession, he threw all his weight against it because the rest of
      the South was averse. He charged his opponents, whose leader was Robert
      Barnwell Rhett, with aiming to place the other Southern States "in such
      circumstances that, having a common destiny, they would be compelled to be
      involved in a common sacrifice." He protested that "to force a sovereign
      State to take a position against its consent is to make of it a reluctant
      associate.... Both interest and honor must require the Southern States to
      take council together."
    </p>
    <p>
      That acute thinker was now in his grave. The bold enthusiast whom he
      defeated in 1851 had now no opponent that was his match. No great
      personality resisted the fiery advocates from Alabama and Mississippi.
      Their advice was accepted. On December 20, 1860, the cause that ten years
      before had failed was successful. The convention, having adjourned from
      Columbia to Charleston, passed an ordinance of secession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in Georgia, at a hundred meetings, the secession issue was
      being hotly discussed. But there was not yet any certainty which way the
      scale would turn. An invitation from South Carolina to join in a general
      Southern convention had been declined by the Governor in November.
      Governor Brown has left an account ascribing the comparative coolness and
      deliberation of the hour to the prevailing impression that President
      Buchanan had pledged himself not to alter the military status at
      Charleston. In an interview between South Carolina representatives and the
      President, the Carolinians understood that such a pledge was given. "It
      was generally understood by the country," says Governor Brown, "that such
      an agreement... had been entered Into... and that Governor Floyd of
      Virginia, then Secretary of War, had expressed his determination to resign
      his position in the Cabinet in case of the refusal of the President to
      carry out the agreement in good faith. The resignation of Governor Floyd
      was therefore naturally looked upon, should it occur, as a signal given to
      the South that reinforcements were to be sent to Charleston and that the
      coercive policy had been adopted by the Federal Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the "canvass in Georgia for members of the State convention was
      progressing with much interest on both sides," there came suddenly the
      news that Anderson had transferred his garrison from Fort Moultrie to the
      island fortress of Sumter. That same day commissioners from South
      Carolina, newly arrived at Washington, sought in vain to persuade the
      President to order Anderson back to Moultrie. The Secretary of War made
      the subject an issue before the Cabinet. Unable to carry his point, two
      days later he resigned. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The President had already asked for Floyd's resignation
     because of financial irregularities, and Floyd was shrewd
     enough to use Anderson's coup as an excuse for resigning.

     236 (note).

    <p>
      The Georgia Governor, who had not hitherto been in the front rank of the
      aggressives, now struck a great blow. Senator Toombs had telegraphed from
      Washington that Fort Pulaski, guarding the Savannah River, was "in
      danger." The Governor had reached the same conclusion. He mustered the
      state militia and seized Fort Pulaski. Early in the morning on January
      3,1861, the fort was occupied by Georgia troops. Shortly afterward, Brown
      wrote to a commissioner sent by the Governor of Alabama to confer with
      him: "While many of our most patriotic and intelligent citizens in both
      States have doubted the propriety of immediate secession, I feel quite
      confident that recent events have dispelled those doubts from the minds of
      most men who have, till within the past few days, honestly sustained
      them." The first stage of the secession movement was at an end; the second
      had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      A belief that Washington had entered upon a policy of aggression swept the
      lower South. The state conventions assembling about this time passed
      ordinances of secession&mdash;Mississippi, January 9; Florida, January 10;
      Alabama, January 11; Georgia, January 19; Louisiana, January 26; Texas,
      February 1. But this result was not achieved without considerable
      opposition. In Georgia the Unionists put up a stout fight. The issue was
      not upon the right to secede&mdash;virtually no one denied the right&mdash;but
      upon the wisdom of invoking the right. Stephens, gloomy and pessimistic,
      led the opposition. Toombs came down from Washington to take part with the
      secessionists. From South Carolina and Alabama, both ceaselessly active
      for secession, commissioners appeared to lobby at Milledgeville, as
      commissioners of Alabama and Mississippi had lobbied at Columbia. Besides
      the out-and-out Unionists, there were those who wanted to temporize, to
      threaten the North, and to wait for developments. The motion on which
      these men and the Unionists made their last stand together went against
      them 164 to 133. Then at last came the square question: Shall we secede?
      Even on this question, the minority was dangerously large. Though the
      temporizers came over to the secessionists, and with them came Stephens,
      there was still a minority of 89 irreconcilables against the majority
      numbering 208.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My allegiance," said Stephens afterwards, "was, as I considered it, not
      due to the United States, or to the people of the United States, but to
      Georgia, in her sovereign capacity. Georgia had never parted with her
      right to demand the ultimate allegiance of her citizens."
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempt in Georgia to restrain impetuosity and advance with
      deliberation was paralleled in Alabama, where also the aggressives were
      determined not to permit delay. In the Alabama convention, the
      conservatives brought forward a plan for a general Southern convention to
      be held at Nashville in February. It was rejected by a vote of 54 to 45.
      An attempt to delay secession until after the 4th of March was defeated by
      the same vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      The determination of the radicals to precipitate the issue received
      interesting criticism from the Governor of Texas, old Sam Houston. To a
      commissioner from Alabama who was sent out to preach the cause in Texas
      the Governor wrote, in substance, that since Alabama would not wait to
      consult the people of Texas he saw nothing to discuss at that time, and he
      went on to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognizing as I do the fact that the sectional tendencies of the Black
      Republican party call for determined constitutional resistance at the
      hands of the united South, I also feel that the million and a half of
      noble-hearted, conservative men who have stood by the South, even to this
      hour, deserve some sympathy and support. Although we have lost the day, we
      have to recollect that our conservative Northern friends cast over a
      quarter of a million more votes against the Black Republicans than we of
      the entire South. I cannot declare myself ready to desert them as well as
      our Southern brethren of the border (and such, I believe, will be the
      sentiment of Texas) until at least one firm attempt has been made to
      preserve our constitutional rights within the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Houston was not able to control his State. Delegates from
      Texas attended the later sessions of a general Congress of the seceding
      States which, on the invitation of Alabama, met at Montgomery on the 4th
      of February. A contemporary document of singular interest today is the
      series of resolutions adopted by the Legislature of North Carolina,
      setting forth that, as the State was a member of the Federal Union, it
      could not accept the invitation of Alabama but should send delegates for
      the purpose of persuading the South to effect a readjustment on the basis
      of the Crittenden Compromise as modified by the Legislature of Virginia.
      The commissioners were sent, were graciously received, were accorded seats
      in the Congress, but they exerted no influence on the course of its
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Congress speedily organized a provisional Government for the
      Confederate States of America. The Constitution of the United States,
      rather hastily reconsidered, became with a few inevitable alterations the
      Constitution of the Confederacy. * Davis was unanimously elected
      President; Stephens, Vice-President. Provision was made for raising an
      army. Commissioners were dispatched to Washington to negotiate a treaty
      with the United States; other commissioners were sent to Virginia to
      attempt to withdraw that great commonwealth from the Union.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * To the observer of a later age this document appears a
     thing of haste. Like the framers of the Constitution of
     1787, who omitted from their document some principles which
     they took for granted, the framers of 1861 left unstated
     their most distinctive views. The basal idea upon which the
     revolution proceeded, the right of secession, is not to be
     found in the new Constitution. Though the preamble declares
     that the States are acting in their sovereign and
     independent character, the new Confederation is declared
     "permanent." In the body of the document are provisions
     similar to those in the Federal Constitution enabling a
     majority of two-thirds of the States to amend at their
     pleasure, thus imposing their will upon the minority. With
     three notable exceptions the new Constitution, subsequent to
     the preamble, does little more than restate the Constitution
     of 1787 rearranged so as to include those basal principles
     of the English law added to the earlier Constitution by the
     first eight amendments. The three exceptions are the
     prohibitions (1) of the payment of bounties, (2) of the
     levying of duties to promote any one form of industry, and
     (3) of appropriations for internal improvements. Here was a
     monument to the battle over these matters in the Federal
     Congress. As to the mechanism of the new Government it was
     the same as the old except for a few changes of detail. The
     presidential term was lengthened to six years and the
     President was forbidden to succeed himself. The President
     was given the power to veto items in appropriation bills.
     The African slave-trade was prohibited.
</pre>
    <p>
      The upper South was thus placed in a painful situation. Its sympathies
      were with the seceding States. Most of its people felt also that if
      coercion was attempted, the issue would become for Virginia and North
      Carolina, no less than for South Carolina and Alabama, simply a matter of
      self-preservation. As early as January, in the exciting days when Floyd's
      resignation was being interpreted as a call to arms, the Virginia
      Legislature had resolved that it would not consent to the coercion of a
      seceding State. In May the Speaker of the North Carolina Legislature
      assured a commissioner from Georgia that North Carolina would never
      consent to the movement of troops "from or across" the State to attack a
      seceding State. But neither Virginia nor North Carolina in this second
      stage of the movement wanted to secede. They wanted to preserve the Union,
      but along with the Union they wanted the principle of local autonomy. It
      was a period of tense anxiety in those States of the upper South. The
      frame of mind of the men who loved the Union but who loved equally their
      own States and were firm for local autonomy is summed up in a letter in
      which Mrs. Robert E. Lee describes the anguish of her husband as he
      confronted the possibility of a divided country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real tragedy of the time lay in the failure of the advocates of these
      two great principles&mdash;each so necessary to a far-flung democratic
      country in a world of great powers!&mdash;the failure to coordinate them
      so as to insure freedom at home and strength abroad. The principle for
      which Lincoln stood has saved Americans in the Great War from playing such
      a trembling part as that of Holland. The principle which seemed to Lee
      even more essential, which did not perish at Appomattox but was
      transformed and not destroyed, is what has kept us from becoming a western
      Prussia. And yet if only it had been possible to coordinate the two
      without the price of war! It was not possible because of the stored up
      bitterness of a quarter century of recrimination. But Virginia made a last
      desperate attempt to preserve the Union by calling the Peace Convention.
      It assembled at Washington the day the Confederate Congress met at
      Montgomery. Though twenty-one States sent delegates, it was no more able
      to effect a working scheme of compromise than was the House committee of
      thirty-three or the Senate committee of thirteen, both of which had
      striven, had failed, and had gone their ways to a place in the great
      company of historic futilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the Peace Convention came and went, and there was no consolation
      for the troubled men of the upper South who did not want to secede but
      were resolved not to abandon local autonomy. Virginia was the key to the
      situation. If Virginia could be forced into secession, the rest of the
      upper South would inevitably follow. Therefore a Virginia hothead, Roger
      A. Pryor, being in Charleston in those wavering days, poured out his heart
      in fiery words, urging a Charleston crowd to precipitate war, in the
      certainty that Virginia would then have to come to their aid. When at last
      Sumter was fired upon and Lincoln called for volunteers, the second stage
      of the secession movement ended in a thunderclap. The third period was
      occupied by the second group of secessions: Virginia on the 17th of April,
      North Carolina and Arkansas during May, Tennessee early in June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sumter was the turning-point. The boom of the first cannon trained on the
      island fortress deserves all the rhetoric it has inspired. Who was
      immediately responsible for that firing which was destiny? Ultimate
      responsibility is not upon any person. War had to be. If Sumter had not
      been the starting-point, some other would have been found. Nevertheless
      the question of immediate responsibility, of whose word it was that served
      as the signal to begin, has produced an historic controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was known at Charleston that Lincoln would attempt to provision
      the fort, the South Carolina authorities referred the matter to the
      Confederate authorities. The Cabinet, in a fateful session at Montgomery,
      hesitated&mdash;drawn between the wish to keep their hold upon the
      moderates of the North, who were trying to stave off war, and the desire
      to precipitate Virginia into the lists. Toombs, Secretary of State in the
      new Government, wavered; then seemed to find his resolution and came out
      strong against a demand for surrender. "It is suicide, murder, and will
      lose us every friend at the North.... It is unnecessary; it puts us in the
      wrong; it is fatal," said he. But the Cabinet and the President decided to
      take the risk. To General Pierre Beauregard, recently placed in command of
      the militia assembled at Charleston, word was sent to demand the surrender
      of Fort Sumter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday, the 7th of April, besides his instructions from Montgomery,
      Beauregard was in receipt of a telegram from the Confederate commissioners
      at Washington, repeating newspaper statements that the Federal relief
      expedition intended to land a force "which will overcome all opposition."
      There seems no doubt that Beauregard did not believe that the expedition
      was intended merely to provision Sumter. Probably every one in Charleston
      thought that the Federal authorities were trying to deceive them, that
      Lincoln's promise not to do more than provision Sumter was a mere blind.
      Fearfulness that delay might render Sumter impregnable lay back of
      Beauregard's formal demand, on the 11th of April, for the surrender of the
      fort. Anderson refused but "made some verbal observations" to the aides
      who brought him the demand. In effect he said that lack of supplies would
      compel him to surrender by the fifteenth. When this information was taken
      back to the city, eager crowds were in the streets of Charleston
      discussing the report that a bombardment would soon begin. But the
      afternoon passed; night fell; and nothing was done. On the beautiful
      terrace along the sea known as East Battery, people congregated, watching
      the silent fortress whose brick walls rose sheer from the midst of the
      harbor. The early hours of the night went by and as midnight approached
      and still there was no flash from either the fortress or the shore
      batteries which threatened it, the crowds broke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there was anxious consultation at the hotel where Beauregard had
      fixed his headquarters. Pilots came in from the sea to report to the
      General that a Federal vessel had appeared off the mouth of the harbor.
      This news may well explain the hasty dispatch of a second expedition to
      Sumter in the middle of the night. At half after one, Friday morning, four
      young men, aides of Beauregard, entered the fort. Anderson repeated his
      refusal to surrender at once but admitted that he would have to surrender
      within three days. Thereupon the aides held a council of war. They decided
      that the reply was unsatisfactory and wrote out a brief note which they
      handed to Anderson informing him that the Confederates would open "fire
      upon Fort Sumter in one hour from this time." The note was dated 3:20 A.M.
      The aides then proceeded to Fort Johnston on the south side of the harbor
      and gave the order to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The council of the aides at Sumter is the dramatic detail that has caught
      the imagination of historians and has led them, at least in some cases, to
      yield to a literary temptation. It is so dramatic&mdash;that scene of the
      four young men holding in their hands, during a moment of absolute
      destiny, the fate of a people; four young men, in the irresponsible ardor
      of youth, refusing to wait three days and forcing war at the instant! It
      is so dramatic that one cannot judge harshly the artistic temper which is
      unable to reject it. But is the incident historic? Did the four young men
      come to Sumter without definite instructions? Was their conference really
      anything more than a careful comparing of notes to make sure they were
      doing what they were intended to do? Is not the real clue to the event a
      message from Beauregard to the Secretary of War telling of his interview
      with the pilots? *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A chief authority for the dramatic version of the council
     of the aides is that fiery Virginian, Roger A. Pryor. He and
     another accompanied the official messengers, the signers of
     the note to Anderson, James Chestnut and Stephen Lee. Years
     afterwards Pryor told the story of the council in a way to
     establish its dramatic significance. But would there be
     anything strange if a veteran survivor, looking back to his
     youth, as all of us do through more or less of mirage
     yielded to the unconscious artist that is in us all and
     dramatized this event unaware?

    <p>
      Dawn was breaking gray, with a faint rain in the air, when the first boom
      of the cannon awakened the city. Other detonations followed in quick
      succession. Shells rose into the night from both sides of the harbor and
      from floating batteries. How lightly Charleston slept that night may be
      inferred from the accounts in the newspapers. "At the report of the first
      gun," says the Courier, "the city was nearly emptied of its inhabitants
      who crowded the Battery and the wharves to witness the conflict."
    </p>
    <p>
      The East Battery and the lower harbor of the lovely city of Charleston
      have been preserved almost without alteration. What they are today they
      were in the breaking dawn on April 12, 1861. Business has gone up the
      rivers between which Charleston lies and has left the point of the city's
      peninsula, where East Battery looks outward to the Atlantic, in its
      perfect charm. There large houses, pillared, with high piazzas, stand
      apart one from another among gardens. With few exceptions they were built
      before the middle of the century and all, with one exception, show the
      classical taste of those days. The mariner, entering the spacious inner
      sea that is Charleston Harbor, sights this row of stately mansions even
      before he crosses the bar seven miles distant. Holding straight onward up
      into the land he heads first for the famous little island where, nowadays,
      in their halo of thrilling recollection, the walls of Sumter, rising sheer
      from the bosom of the water, drowse idle. Close under the lee of Sumter,
      the incoming steersman brings his ship about and chooses, probably, the
      eastward of two huge tentacles of the sea between which lies the city's
      long but narrow peninsula. To the steersman it shows a skyline serrated by
      steeples, fronted by sea, flanked southward by sea, backgrounded by an
      estuary, and looped about by a sickle of wooded islands. This same scene,
      so far as city and nature go, was beheld by the crowds that swarmed East
      Battery, a flagstone marine parade along the seaward side of the boulevard
      that faces Sumter; that filled the windows and even the housetops; that
      watched the bombardment with the eagerness of an audience in an
      amphitheater; that applauded every telling shot with clapping of hands and
      waving of shawls and handkerchiefs. The fort lay distant from them about
      three miles, but only some fifteen hundred yards from Fort Johnston on one
      side and about a mile from Fort Moultrie on the other. From both of these
      latter, the cannon of those days were equal to the task of harassing
      Sumter. Early in the morning of the 12th of April, though not until broad
      day had come, did Anderson make reply. All that day, at first under
      heavily rolling cloud and later through curiously misty sunshine, the fire
      and counterfire continued. "The enthusiasm and fearlessness of the
      spectators," says the Charleston Mercury, "knew no bounds." Reckless
      observers even put out in small boats and roamed about the harbor almost
      under the guns of the fort. Outside the bar, vessels of the relieving
      squadron were now visible, and to these Anderson signaled for aid. They
      made an attempt to reach the fort, but only part of the squadron had
      arrived; and the vessels necessary to raise the siege were not there. The
      attempt ended in failure. When night came, a string of rowboats each
      carrying a huge torch kept watch along the bar to guard against surprise
      from the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that Friday night the harbor was swept by storm. But in spite of
      torrents of rain East Battery and the rooftops were thronged. "The wind
      was inshore and the booming was startlingly distinct." At the height of
      the bombardment, the sky above Sumter seemed to be filled with the flashes
      of bursting shells. But during this wild night Sumter itself was both dark
      and silent. Its casements did not have adequate lamps and the guns could
      not be used except by day. When morning broke, clear and bright after the
      night's storm, the duel was resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of Sumter were now crumbling. At eight o'clock Saturday morning
      the barracks took fire. Soon after it was perceived from the shore that
      the flag was down. Beauregard at once sent offers of assistance. With
      Sumter in flames above his head, Anderson replied that he had not
      surrendered; he declined assistance; and he hauled up his flag. Later in
      the day the flagstaff was shot in two and again the flag fell, and again
      it was raised. Flames had been kindled anew by red-hot shot, and now the
      magazine was in danger. Quantities of powder were thrown into the sea.
      Still the rain of red-hot shot continued. About noon, Saturday, says the
      Courier, "flames burst out from every quarter of Sumter and poured from
      many of its portholes... the wind was from the west driving the smoke
      across the fort into the embrasures where the gunners were at work."
      Nevertheless, "as if served with a new impulse," the guns of Sumter
      redoubled their fire. But it was not in human endurance to keep on in the
      midst of the burning fort. This splendid last effort was short. At a
      quarter after one, Anderson ceased firing and raised a white flag.
      Negotiations followed ending in terms of surrender&mdash;Anderson to be
      allowed to remove his garrison to the fleet lying idle beyond the bar and
      to salute the flag of the United States before taking it down. The
      bombardment had lasted thirty-two hours without a death on either side.
      The evacuation of the fort was to take place next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon of Sunday, the 14th of April, was a gala day in the harbor
      of Charleston. The sunlight slanted across the roofs of the city, sparkled
      upon the sea. Deep and rich the harbor always looks in the spring sunshine
      on bright afternoons. The filmy atmosphere of these latitudes, at that
      time of year, makes the sky above the darkling, afternoon sea a pale but
      luminous turquoise. There is a wonderful soft strength in the peaceful
      brightness of the sun. In such an atmosphere the harbor was flecked with
      brilliantly decked craft of every description, all in a flutter of flags
      and carrying a host of passengers in gala dress. The city swarmed across
      the water to witness the ceremony of evacuation. Wherry men did a thriving
      business carrying passengers to the fort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anderson withdrew from Sumter shortly after two o'clock amid a salute of
      fifty guns. The Confederates took possession. At half after four a new
      flag was raised above the battered and fire-swept walls.

    <h2>
      Chapter II. The Davis Government
    </h2>
    <p>
      It has never been explained why Jefferson Davis was chosen President of
      the Confederacy. He did not seek the office and did not wish it. He
      dreamed of high military command. As a study in the irony of fate, Davis's
      career is made to the hand of the dramatist. An instinctive soldier, he
      was driven by circumstances three times to renounce the profession of arms
      for a less congenial civilian life. His final renunciation, which proved
      to be of the nature of tragedy, was his acceptance of the office of
      President. Indeed, why the office was given to him seems a mystery. Rhett
      was a more logical candidate. And when Rhett, early in the lobbying at
      Montgomery, was set aside as too much of a radical, Toombs seemed for a
      time the certain choice of the majority. The change to Davis came suddenly
      at the last moment. It was puzzling at the time; it is puzzling still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhett, though doubtless bitterly disappointed, bore himself with the
      savoir faire of a great gentleman. At the inauguration, it was on Rhett's
      arm that Davis leaned as he entered the hall of the Confederate Congress.
      The night before, in a public address, Yancey had said that the man and
      the hour were met. The story of the Confederacy is filled with dramatic
      moments, but to the thoughtful observer few are more dramatic than the
      conjunction of these three men in the inauguration of the Confederate
      President. Beneath a surface of apparent unanimity they carried, like
      concealed weapons, points of view that were in deadly antagonism. This
      antagonism had not revealed itself hitherto. It was destined to reveal
      itself almost immediately. It went so deep and spread so far that unless
      we understand it, the Confederate story will be unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange fatality destined all three of these great men to despair.
      Yancey, who was perhaps most directly answerable of the three for the
      existence of the Confederacy, lost influence almost from the moment when
      his dream became established. Davis was partly responsible, for he
      promptly sent him out of the country on the bootless English mission.
      Thereafter, until his death in 1863, Yancey was a waning, overshadowed
      figure, steadily lapsing into the background. It may be that those critics
      are right who say he was only an agitator. The day of the mere agitator
      was gone. Yancey passed rapidly into futile but bitter antagonism to
      Davis. In this attitude he was soon to be matched by Rhett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discontent of the Rhett faction because their leader was not given the
      portfolio of the State Department found immediate voice. But the
      conclusion drawn by some that Rhett's subsequent course sprang from
      personal vindictiveness is trifling. He was too large a personality, too
      well defined an intellect, to be thus explained. Very probably Davis made
      his first great blunder in failing to propitiate the Rhett faction. And
      yet few things are more certain than that the two men, the two factions
      which they symbolized, could not have formed a permanent alliance. Had
      Rhett entered the Cabinet he could not have remained in it consistently
      for any considerable time. The measures in which, presently, the
      Administration showed its hand were measures in which Rhett could not
      acquiesce. From the start he was predestined to his eventual position&mdash;the
      great, unavailing genius of the opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the comparative ignoring of these leaders of secession by the
      Government which secession had created, it is often said that the
      explanation is to be found in a generous as well as politic desire to put
      in office the moderates and even the conservatives. Davis, relatively, was
      a moderate. Stephens was a conservative. Many of the most pronounced
      opponents of secession were given places in the public service. Toombs,
      who received the portfolio of State, though a secessionist, was
      conspicuously a moderate when compared with Rhett and Yancey. The adroit
      Benjamin, who became Attorney-General, had few points in common with the
      great extremists of Alabama and South Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the dictum that the personnel of the new Government was a triumph
      for conservatism over radicalism signifies little. There was a division
      among Southerners which scarcely any of them had realized except briefly
      in the premature battle over secession in 1851. It was the division
      between those who were conscious of the region as a whole and those who
      were not. Explain it as you will, there was a moment just after the
      secession movement succeeded when the South seemed to realize itself as a
      whole, when it turned intuitively to those men who, as time was to
      demonstrate, shared this realization. For the moment it turned away from
      those others, however great their part in secession, who lacked this sense
      of unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, geography becomes essential. The South fell,
      institutionally, into two grand divisions: one, with an old and firmly
      established social order, where consciousness of the locality went back to
      remote times; another, newly settled, where conditions were still fluid,
      where that sense of the sacredness of local institutions had not yet
      formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical community of the first-named class was South Carolina. Her
      people had to a remarkable degree been rendered state-conscious partly by
      their geographical neighbors, and partly by their long and illustrious
      history, which had been interwoven with great European interests during
      the colonial era and with great national interests under the Republic. It
      is possible also that the Huguenots, though few in numbers, had exercised
      upon the State a subtle and pervasive influence through their intellectual
      power and their Latin sense for institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In South Carolina, too, a wealthy leisure class with a passion for affairs
      had cultivated enthusiastically that fine art which is the pride of all
      aristocratic societies, the service of the State as a profession high and
      exclusive, free from vulgar taint. In South Carolina all things conspired
      to uphold and strengthen the sense of the State as an object of
      veneration, as something over and above the mere social order, as the
      sacred embodiment of the ideals of the community. Thus it is fair to say
      that what has animated the heroic little countries of the Old World
      Switzerland and Serbia and ever-glorious Belgium&mdash;with their passion
      to remain themselves, animated South Carolina in 1861. Just as Serbia was
      willing to fight to the death rather than merge her identity in the mosaic
      of the Austrian Empire, so this little American community saw nothing of
      happiness in any future that did not secure its virtual independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical of the newer order in the South was the community that formed the
      President of the Confederacy. In the history of Mississippi previous to
      the war there are six great names&mdash;Jacob Thompson, John A. Quitman,
      Henry S. Foote, Robert J. Walker, Sergeant S. Prentiss, and Jefferson
      Davis. Not one of them was born in the State. Thompson was born in North
      Carolina; Quitman in New York; Foote in Virginia; Walker in Pennsylvania;
      Prentiss in Maine; Davis in Kentucky. In 1861 the State was but forty-four
      years old, younger than its most illustrious sons&mdash;if the paradox may
      be permitted. How could they think of it as an entity existing in itself,
      antedating not only themselves but their traditions, circumscribing them
      with its all-embracing, indisputable reality? These men spoke the language
      of state rights. It is true that in politics, combating the North, they
      used the political philosophy taught them by South Carolina. But it was a
      mental weapon in political debate; it was not for them an emotional fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet these men of the Southwest had an ideal of their own as vivid and
      as binding as the state ideal of the men of the eastern coast. Though half
      their leaders were born in the North, the people themselves were
      overwhelmingly Southern. From all the older States, all round the huge
      crescent which swung around from Kentucky coastwise to Florida,
      immigration in the twenties and thirties had poured into Mississippi.
      Consequently the new community presented a composite picture of the whole
      South, and like all composite pictures it emphasized only the factors
      common to all its parts. What all the South had in common, what made a man
      a Southerner in the general sense&mdash;in distinction from a Northerner
      on the one hand, or a Virginian, Carolinian, Georgian, on the other&mdash;could
      have been observed with clearness in Mississippi, just before the war, as
      nowhere else. Therefore, the fulfillment of the ideal of Southern life in
      general terms was the vision of things hoped for by the new men of the
      Southwest. The features of that vision were common to them all&mdash;country
      life, broad acres, generous hospitality, an aristocratic system. The
      temperaments of these men were sufficiently buoyant to enable them to
      apprehend this ideal even before it had materialized. Their romantic minds
      could see the gold at the end of the rainbow. Theirs was not the pride of
      administering a well-ordered, inherited system, but the joy of building a
      new system, in their minds wholly elastic, to be sure, but still inspired
      by that old system.
    </p>
    <p>
      What may be called the sense of Southern nationality as opposed to the
      sense of state rights, strictly speaking, distinguished this brilliant
      young community of the Southwest. In that community Davis spent the years
      that appear to have been the most impressionable of his life. Belonging to
      a "new" family just emerging into wealth, he began life as a West Pointer
      and saw gallant service as a youth on the frontier; resigned from the army
      to pursue a romantic attachment; came home to lead the life of a wealthy
      planter and receive the impress of Mississippi; made his entry into
      politics, still a soldier at heart, with the philosophy of state rights on
      his lips, but in his heart that sense of the Southern people as a new
      nation, which needed only the occasion to make it the relentless enemy of
      the rights of the individual Southern States. Add together the instinctive
      military point of view and this Southern nationalism that even in 1861 had
      scarcely revealed itself; join with these a fearless and haughty spirit,
      proud to the verge of arrogance, but perfectly devoted, perfectly sincere;
      and you have the main lines of the political character of Davis when he
      became President. It may be that as he went forward in his great
      undertaking, as antagonisms developed, as Rhett and others turned against
      him, Davis hardened. He lost whatever comprehension he once had of the
      Rhett type. Seeking to weld into one irresistible unit all the military
      power of the South, he became at last in the eyes of his opponents a
      monster, while to him, more and more positively, the others became mere
      dreamers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took about a year for this irrepressible conflict within the
      Confederacy to reveal itself. During the twelve months following Davis's
      election as provisional President, he dominated the situation, though the
      Charleston Mercury, the Rhett organ, found opportunities to be sharply
      critical of the President. He assembled armies; he initiated heroic
      efforts to make up for the handicap of the South in the manufacture of
      munitions and succeeded in starting a number of munition plants; though
      powerless to prevent the establishment of the blockade, he was able during
      that first year to keep in touch with Europe, to start out Confederate
      privateers upon the high seas, and to import a considerable quantity of
      arms and supplies. At the close of the year the Confederate armies were
      approaching general efficiency, for all their enormous handicap, almost if
      not quite as rapidly as were the Union armies. And the one great event of
      the year on land, the first battle of Manassas, or Bull Run, was a signal
      Confederate victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure Davis was severely criticized in some quarters for not adopting
      an aggressive policy. The Confederate Government, whether wisely or
      foolishly, had not taken the people into its confidence and the lack of
      munitions was not generally appreciated. The easy popular cries were all
      sounded: "We are standing still!" "The country is being invaded!" "The
      President is a do-nothing!" From the coast regions especially, where the
      blockade was felt in all its severity, the outcry was loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the South in the main was content with the Administration
      during most of the first year. In November, when the general elections
      were held, Davis was chosen without opposition as the first regular
      Confederate President for six years, and Stephens became the
      Vice-President. The election was followed by an important change in the
      Southern Cabinet. Benjamin became Secretary of War, in succession to the
      first War Secretary, Leroy P. Walker. Toombs had already left the
      Confederate Cabinet. Complaining that Davis degraded him to the level of a
      mere clerk, he had withdrawn the previous July. His successor in the State
      Department was R. M. T. Hunter of Virginia, who remained in office until
      February, 1862, when his removal to the Confederate Senate opened the way
      for a further advancement of Benjamin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richmond, which had been designated as the capital soon after the
      secession of Virginia, was the scene of the inauguration, on February 22,
      1862. Although the weather proved bleak and rainy, an immense crowd
      gathered around the Washington monument, in Capitol Square, to listen to
      the inaugural address. By this time the confidence in the Government,
      which was felt generally at the time of the election, had suffered a
      shock. Foreign affairs were not progressing satisfactorily. Though England
      had accorded to the Confederacy the status of a belligerent, this was poor
      consolation for her refusal to make full recognition of the new Government
      as an independent power. Dread of internal distress was increasing. Gold
      commanded a premium of fifty percent. Disorder was a feature of the life
      in the cities. It was known that several recent military events had been
      victories for the Federals. A rumor was abroad that some great disaster
      had taken place in Tennessee. The crowd listened anxiously to hear the
      rumor denied by the President. But it was not denied. The tense listeners
      noted two sentences which formed an admission that the situation was
      grave: "A million men, it is estimated, are now standing in hostile array
      and waging war along a frontier of thousands of miles. Battles have been
      fought, sieges have been conducted, and although the contest is not ended,
      and the tide for the moment is against us, the final result in our favor
      is not doubtful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind these carefully guarded words lay serious alarm, not only with
      regard to the operations at the front but as to the composition of the
      army. It had been raised under various laws and its portions were subject
      to conflicting classifications; it was partly a group of state armies,
      partly a single Confederate army. None of its members had enlisted for
      long terms. Many enlistments would expire early in 1862. The fears of the
      Confederate Administration with regard to this matter, together with its
      alarm about the events at the front, were expressed by Davis in a frank
      message to the Southern Congress, three days later. "I have hoped," said
      he, "for several days to receive official reports in relation to our
      discomfiture at Roanoke Island and the fall of Fort Donelson. They have
      not yet reached Me.... The hope is still entertained that our reported
      losses at Fort Donelson have been greatly exaggerated...." He went on to
      condemn the policy of enlistments for short terms, "against which," said
      he, "I have steadily contended"; and he enlarged upon the danger that even
      patriotic men, who intended to reenlist, might go home to put their
      affairs in order and that thus, at a critical moment, the army might be
      seriously reduced. The accompanying report of the Confederate Secretary of
      War showed a total in the army of 340,250 men. This was an inadequate
      force with which to meet the great hosts which were being organized
      against it in the North. To permit the slightest reduction of the army at
      that moment seemed to the Southern President suicidal.

      But Davis waited some time longer before proposing to the Confederate
      Congress the adoption of conscription. Meanwhile, the details of two great
      reverses, the loss of Roanoke Island and the loss of Fort Donelson, became
      generally known. Apprehension gathered strength. Newspapers began to
      discuss conscription as something inevitable. At last, on March 28, 1862,
      Davis sent a message to the Confederate Congress advising the conscription
      of all white males between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five. For this
      suggestion Congress was ripe, and the first Conscription Act of the
      Confederacy was signed by the President on the 16th of April. The age of
      eligibility was fixed as Davis had advised; the term of service was to be
      three years; every one then in service was to be retained in service
      during three years from the date of his original enlistment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This statute may be thought of as a great victory on the part of the
      Administration. It was the climax of a policy of centralization in the
      military establishment to which Davis had committed himself by the veto,
      in January, of "A bill to authorize the Secretary of War to receive into
      the service of the Confederate States a regiment of volunteers for the
      protection of the frontier of Texas." This regiment was to be under the
      control of the Governor of the State. In refusing to accept such troops,
      Davis laid down the main proposition upon which he stood as military
      executive to the end of the war, a proposition which immediately set
      debate raging: "Unity and cooperation by the troops of all the States are
      indispensable to success, and I must view with regret this as well as all
      other indications of a purpose to divide the power of States by dividing
      the means to be employed in efforts to carry on separate operations."
    </p>
    <p>
      In these military measures of the early months of 1862 Davis's purpose
      became clear. He was bent upon instituting a strong government, able to
      push the war through, and careless of the niceties of constitutional law
      or of the exact prerogatives of the States. His position was expressed in
      the course of the year by a Virginia newspaper: "It will be time enough to
      distract the councils of the State about imaginary violations of
      constitutional law by the supreme government when our independence is
      achieved, established, and acknowledged. It will not be until then that
      the sovereignty of the States will be a reality." But there were many
      Southerners who could not accept this point of view. The Mercury was
      sharply critical of the veto of the Texas Regiment Bill. In the interval
      between the Texas veto and the passing of the Conscription Act, the state
      convention of North Carolina demanded the return of North Carolina
      volunteers for the defense of their own State. No sooner was the
      Conscription Act passed than its constitutionality was attacked. As the
      Confederacy had no Supreme Court, the question came up before state
      courts. One after another, several state supreme courts pronounced the act
      constitutional and in most of the States the constitutional issue was
      gradually allowed to lapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Davis had opened Pandora's box. The clash between State and
      Confederate authority had begun. An opposition party began to form. In
      this first stage of its definite existence, the opposition made an
      interesting attempt to control the Cabinet. Secretary Benjamin, though
      greatly trusted by the President, seems never to have been a popular
      minister. Congress attempted to load upon Benjamin the blame for Roanoke
      Island and Fort Donelson. In the House a motion was introduced to the
      effect that Benjamin had "not the confidence of the people of the
      Confederate States nor of the army... and that we most respectfully
      request his retirement" from the office of Secretary of War. Friends of
      the Administration tabled the motion. Davis extricated his friend by
      taking advantage of Hunter's retirement and promoting Benjamin to the
      State Department. A month later a congressional committee appointed to
      investigate the affair of Roanoke Island exonerated the officer in command
      and laid the blame on his superiors, including "the late Secretary of
      War."
    </p>
    <p>
      With Benjamin safe in the Department of State, with the majority in the
      Confederate Congress still fairly manageable, with the Conscription Act in
      force, Davis seemed to be strong enough in the spring of 1862 to ignore
      the gathering opposition. And yet there was another measure, second only
      in the President's eyes to the Conscription Act, that was to breed
      trouble. This was the first of the series of acts empowering him to
      suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Under this act he was
      permitted to set up martial law in any district threatened with invasion.
      The cause of this drastic measure was the confusion and the general
      demoralization that existed wherever the close approach of the enemy
      created a situation too complex for the ordinary civil authorities. Davis
      made use of the power thus given to him and proclaimed martial law in
      Richmond, in Norfolk, in parts of South Carolina, and elsewhere. It was on
      Richmond that the hand of the Administration fell heaviest. The capital
      was the center of a great camp; its sudden and vast increase in population
      bad been the signal for all the criminal class near and far to hurry
      thither in the hope of a new field of spoliation; to deal with this
      immense human congestion, the local police were powerless; every variety
      of abominable contrivance to entrap and debauch men for a price was in
      brazen operation. The first care of the Government under the new law was
      the cleansing of the capital. General John H. Winder, appointed military
      governor, did the job with thoroughness. He closed the barrooms, disarmed
      the populace, and for the time at least swept the city clean of criminals.
      The Administration also made certain political arrests, and even
      imprisoned some extreme opponents of the Government for "offenses not
      enumerated and not cognizable under the regular process of law." Such
      arrests gave the enemies of the Administration another handle against it.
      As we shall see later, the use that Davis made of martial law was distorted
      by a thousand fault-finders and was made the basis of the charge that the
      President was aiming at absolute power.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment, however, Davis was master of the situation. The six months
      following April 1, 1862, were doubtless, from his own point of view, the
      most satisfactory part of his career as Confederate President. These
      months were indeed filled with peril. There was a time when McClellan's
      advance up the Peninsula appeared so threatening that the archives of the
      Government were packed on railway cars prepared for immediate removal
      should evacuation be necessary. There were the other great disasters
      during that year, including the loss of New Orleans. The President himself
      experienced a profound personal sorrow in the death of his friend, Albert
      Sidney Johnston, in the bloody fight at Shiloh. It was in the midst of
      this time that tried men's souls that the Richmond Examiner achieved an
      unenvied immortality for one of its articles on the Administration. At a
      moment when nothing should have been said to discredit in any way the
      struggling Government, it described Davis as weak with fear telling his
      beads in a corner of St. Paul's Church. This paper, along with the
      Charleston Mercury, led the Opposition. Throughout Confederate history
      these two, which were very ably edited, did the thinking for the enemies
      of Davis. We shall meet them time and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A true picture of Davis would have shown the President resolute and
      resourceful, at perhaps the height of his powers. He recruited and
      supplied the armies; he fortified Richmond; he sustained the great captain
      whom he had placed in command while McClellan was at the gates. When the
      tide had turned and the Army of the Potomac sullenly withdrew, baffled,
      there occurred the one brief space in Confederate history that was pure
      sunshine. In this period took place the splendid victory of Second
      Manassas. The strong military policy of the Administration had given the
      Confederacy powerful armies. Lee had inspired them with victory. This
      period of buoyant hope culminated in the great offensive design which
      followed Second Manassas. It was known that the Northern people, or a
      large part of them, had suffered a reaction; the tide was setting strong
      against the Lincoln Government; in the autumn, the Northern elections
      would be held. To influence those elections and at the same time to drive
      the Northern armies back into their own section; to draw Maryland and
      Kentucky into the Confederate States; to fall upon the invaders in the
      Southwest and recover the lower Mississippi&mdash;to accomplish all these
      results was the confident expectation of the President and his advisers as
      they planned their great triple offensive in August, 1862. Lee was to
      invade Maryland; Bragg was to invade Kentucky; Van Dorn was to break the
      hold of the Federals in the Southwest. If there is one moment that is to
      be considered the climax of Davis's career, the high-water mark of
      Confederate hope, it was the moment of joyous expectation when the triple
      offensive was launched, when Lee's army, on a brilliant autumn day,
      crossed the Potomac, singing "Maryland, my Maryland".

      Chapter III. The Fall Of King Cotton
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the Confederate Executive was building up its military
      establishment, the Treasury was struggling with the problem of paying for
      it. The problem was destined to become insoluble. From the vantage-point
      of a later time we can now see that nothing could have provided a solution
      short of appropriation and mobilization of the whole industrial power of
      the country along with the whole military power&mdash;a conscription of
      wealth of every kind together with conscription of men. But in 1862 such
      an idea was too advanced for any group of Americans. Nor, in that year,
      was there as yet any certain evidence that the Treasury was facing an
      impossible situation. Its endeavors were taken lightly&mdash;at first,
      almost gaily-because of the profound illusion which permeated Southern
      thought that Cotton was King. Obviously, if the Southern ports could be
      kept open and cotton could continue to go to market, the Confederate
      financial problem was not serious. When Davis, soon after his first
      inauguration, sent Yancey, Rost, and Mann as commissioners to Europe to
      press the claims of the Confederacy for recognition, very few Southerners
      had any doubt that the blockade, would be short-lived. "Cotton is King"
      was the answer that silenced all questions. Without American cotton the
      English mills would have to shut down; the operatives would starve; famine
      and discontent would between them force the British ministry to intervene
      in American affairs. There were, indeed, a few far-sighted men who
      perceived that this confidence was ill-based and that cotton, though it
      was a power in the financial world, was not the commercial king. The
      majority of the population, however, had to learn this truth from keen
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several events of 1861 for a time seemed to confirm this illusion. The
      Queen's proclamation in the spring, giving the Confederacy the status of a
      belligerent, and, in the autumn, the demand by the British Government for
      the surrender of the commissioners, Mason and Slidell, who had been taken
      from a British packet by a Union cruiser&mdash;both these events seemed to
      indicate active British sympathy. In England, to be sure, Yancey became
      disillusioned. He saw that the international situation was not so simple
      as it seemed; that while the South had powerful friends abroad, it also
      had powerful foes; that the British anti-slavery party was a more
      formidable enemy than he had expected it to be; and that intervention was
      not a foregone conclusion. The task of an unrecognized ambassador being
      too annoying for him, Yancey was relieved at his own request and Mason was
      sent out to take his place. A singular little incident like a dismal
      prophecy occurred as Yancey was on his way home. He passed through Havana
      early in 1862, when the news of the surrender of Fort Donelson had begun
      to stagger the hopes and impair the prestige of the Confederates. By the
      advice of the Confederate agent in Cuba, Yancey did not call on the
      Spanish Governor but sent him word that "delicacy alone prompted his
      departure without the gratification of a personal interview." The Governor
      expressed himself as "exceedingly grateful for the noble sentiment which
      prevented" Yancey from causing international complications at Havana.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the first year of Confederate foreign affairs is interwoven
      with the history of Confederate finance. During that year the South became
      a great buyer in Europe. Arms, powder, cloth, machinery, medicines, ships,
      a thousand things, had all to be bought abroad. To establish the foreign
      credit of the new Government was the arduous task of the Confederate
      Secretary of the Treasury, Christopher G. Memminger. The first great
      campaign of the war was not fought by armies. It was a commercial campaign
      fought by agents of the Federal and Confederate governments and having for
      its aim the cornering of the munitions market in Europe. In this campaign
      the Federal agents had decisive advantages: their credit was never
      questioned, and their enormous purchases were never doubtful ventures for
      the European sellers. In some cases their superior credit enabled them to
      overbid the Confederate agents and to appropriate large contracts which
      the Confederates had negotiated but which they could not hold because of
      the precariousness of their credit. And yet, all things considered, the
      Confederate agents made a good showing. In the report of the Secretary of
      War in February, 1862, the number of rifles contracted for abroad was put
      at 91,000, of which 15,000 had been delivered. The chief reliance of the
      Confederate Treasury for its purchases abroad was at first the specie in
      the Southern branch of the United States Mint and in Southern banks. The
      former the Confederacy seized and converted to its own use. Of the latter
      it lured into its own hands a very large proportion by what is commonly
      called "the fifteen million loan"&mdash;an issue of eight percent bonds
      authorized in February, 1861. Most of this specie seems to have been taken
      out of the country by the purchase of European commodities. A little, to
      be sure, remained, for there was some gold still at home when the
      Confederacy fell. But the sum was small.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this loan Memminger also persuaded Congress on August 19,
      1861, to lay a direct tax&mdash;the "war tax," as it was called&mdash;of
      one-half of one per cent on all property except Confederate bonds and
      money. As required by the Constitution this tax was apportioned among the
      States, but if it assumed its assessment before April 1, 1862, each State
      was to have a reduction of ten per cent. As there was a general aversion
      to the idea of Confederate taxation and a general faith in loans, what the
      States did, as a rule, was to assume their assessment, agree to pay it
      into the Treasury, and then issue bonds to raise the necessary funds, thus
      converting the war tax into a loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Confederate, like the Union, Treasury did not have the courage to
      force the issue upon taxation and leaned throughout the war largely upon
      loans. It also had recourse to the perilous device of paper money, the
      gold value of which was not guaranteed. Beginning in March, 1861, it
      issued under successive laws great quantities of paper notes, some of them
      interest bearing, some not. It used these notes in payment of its domestic
      obligations. The purchasing value of the notes soon started on a
      disastrous downward course, and in 1864 the gold dollar was worth thirty
      paper dollars. The Confederate Government thus became involved in a
      problem of self-preservation that was but half solved by the system of
      tithes and impressment which we shall encounter later. The depreciation of
      these notes left governmental clerks without adequate salaries and
      soldiers without the means of providing for their families. During most of
      the war, women and other noncombatants had to support the families or else
      rely upon local charity organized by state or county boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before all the evils of paper money were experienced, the North, with
      great swiftness, concentrated its naval forces so as to dominate the
      Southern ports which had trade relations with Europe. The shipping ports
      were at once congested with cotton to the great embarrassment of merchants
      and planters. Partly to relieve them, the Confederate Congress instituted
      in May, 1861, what is known today as "the hundred million loan." It was
      the first of a series of "produce loans." The Treasury was authorized to
      issue eight percent bonds, to fall due in twenty years, and to sell them
      for specie or to exchange them for produce or manufactured articles. In
      the course of the remaining months of 1861 there were exchanged for these
      bonds great quantities of produce including some 400,000 bales of cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the distress of the planters, however, the illusion of King
      Cotton's power does not seem to have been seriously impaired during 1861.
      In fact, strange as it now seems, the frame of mind of the leaders appears
      to have been proof, that year, against alarm over the blockade. For two
      reasons, the Confederacy regarded the blockade at first as a blessing in
      disguise. It was counted on to act as a protective tariff in stimulating
      manufactures; and at the same time the South expected interruption of the
      flow of cotton towards Europe to make England feel her dependence upon the
      Confederacy. In this way there would be exerted an economic coercion which
      would compel intervention. Such reasoning lay behind a law passed in May
      forbidding the export of cotton except through the seaports of the
      Confederacy. Similar laws were enacted by the States. During the summer,
      many cotton factors joined in advising the planters to hold their cotton
      until the blockade broke down. In the autumn, the Governor of Louisiana
      forbade the export of cotton from New Orleans. So unshakeable was the
      illusion in 1861, that King Cotton had England in his grip! The illusion
      died hard. Throughout 1862, and even in 1863, the newspapers published
      appeals to the planters to give up growing cotton for a time, and even to
      destroy what they had, so as to coerce the obdurate Englishmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mason had been accorded by the British upper classes that
      generous welcome which they have always extended to the representative, of
      a people fighting gallantly against odds. During the hopeful days of 1862&mdash;that
      Golden Age of Confederacy&mdash;Mason, though not recognized by the
      English Government, was shown every kindness by leading members of the
      aristocracy, who visited him in London and received him at their houses in
      the country. It was during this period of buoyant hope that the Alabama
      was allowed to go to sea from Liverpool in July, 1862. At the same time
      Mason heard his hosts express undisguised admiration for the valor of the
      soldiers serving under Jackson and Lee. Whether he formed any true
      impression of the other side of British idealism, its resolute opposition
      to slavery, may be questioned. There seems little doubt that he did not
      perceive the turning of the tide of English public opinion, in the autumn
      of 1862, following the Emancipation Proclamation and the great reverses of
      September and October&mdash;Antietam-Sharpsburg, Perryville, Corinth&mdash;the
      backflow of all three of the Confederate offensives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cotton famine in England, where perhaps a million people were in
      actual want through the shutting down of cotton mills, seemed to Mason to
      be "looming up in fearful proportions." "The public mind," he wrote home
      in November, 1862, "is very much disturbed by the prospect for the winter;
      and I am not without hope that it will produce its effects on the councils
      of the government." Yet it was the uprising of the British working people
      in favor of the North that contributed to defeat the one important attempt
      to intervene in American affairs. Napoleon III had made an offer of
      mediation which was rejected by the Washington Government early the next
      year. England and Russia had both declined to participate in Napoleon's
      scheme, and their refusal marks the beginning of the end of the reign of
      King Cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Paris, Slidell was even more hopeful than Mason. He had won over Emile
      Erlanger, that great banker who was deep in the confidence of Napoleon. So
      cordial became the relations between the two that it involved their
      families and led at last to the marriage of Erlanger's son with Slidell's
      daughter. Whether owing to Slidell's eloquence, or from secret knowledge
      of the Emperor's designs, or from his own audacity, Erlanger toward the
      close of 1862 made a proposal that is one of the most daring schemes of
      financial plunging yet recorded. If the Confederate Government would issue
      to him bonds secured by cotton, Erlanger would underwrite the bonds, put
      the proceeds of their sale to the credit of the Confederate agents, and
      wait for the cotton until it could run the blockade or until peace should
      be declared. The Confederate Government after some hesitation accepted his
      plan and issued fifteen millions of "Erlanger bonds," bearing seven
      percent, and put them on sale at Paris, London. Amsterdam, and Frankfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a purchaser of these bonds was to be given cotton eventually at a
      valuation of sixpence a pound, and as cotton was then selling in England
      for nearly two shillings; the bold gamble caught the fancy of speculators.
      There was a rush to take up the bonds and to pay the first installment.
      But before the second installment became due a mysterious change in the
      market took place and the price of the bonds fell. Holders became alarmed
      and some even proposed to forfeit their bonds rather than pay on May 1,
      1863, the next installment of fifteen percent of the purchase money.
      Thereupon Mason undertook to "bull" the market. Agents of the United
      States Government were supposed to be at the bottom of the drop in the
      bonds. To defeat their schemes the Confederate agents bought back large
      amounts in bonds intending to resell. The result was the expenditure of
      some six million dollars with practically no effect on the market. These
      "Erlanger bonds" sold slowly through 1863 and even in 1864, and netted a
      considerable amount to the foreign agents of the Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comparative failure of the Erlanger loan marks the downfall of King
      Cotton. He was an exploded superstition. He was unable, despite the cotton
      famine, to coerce the English workingmen into siding with a country which
      they regarded, because of its support of slavery, as inimical to their
      interests. At home, the Government confessed the powerlessness of King
      Cotton by a change of its attitude toward export. During the latter part
      of the war, the Government secured the meager funds at its disposal abroad
      by rushing cotton in swift ships through the blockade. So important did
      this traffic become that the Confederacy passed stringent laws to keep the
      control in its own hands. One more cause of friction between the
      Confederate and the State authorities was thus developed: the Confederate
      navigation laws prevented the States from running the blockade on their
      own account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effects of the blockade were felt at the ends of the earth. India
      became an exporter of cotton. Egypt also entered the competition. That
      singular dreamer, Ismail Pasha, whose reign made Egypt briefly an exotic
      nation, neither eastern nor western, found one of his opportunities in the
      American War and the failure of the cotton supply.

      Chapter IV. The Reaction Against Richmond
    </h2>
    <p>
      A popular revulsion of feeling preceded and followed the great period of
      Confederate history&mdash;these six months of Titanic effort which
      embraced between March and September, 1862, splendid success along with
      catastrophes. But there was a marked difference between the two tides of
      popular emotion. The wave of alarm which swept over the South after the
      surrender of Fort Donelson was quickly translated into such a high passion
      for battle that the march of events until the day of Antietam resounded
      like an epic. The failure of the triple offensive which closed this period
      was followed in very many minds by the appearance of a new temper, often
      as valiant as the old but far more grim and deeply seamed with distrust.
      And how is this distrust, of which the Confederate Administration was the
      object, to be accounted for?
    </p>
    <p>
      Various answers to this question were made at the time. The laws of the
      spring of 1862 were attacked as unconstitutional. Davis was held
      responsible for them and also for the slow equipment of the army. Because
      the Confederate Congress conducted much of its business in secret session,
      the President was charged with a love of mystery and an unwillingness to
      take the people into his confidence. Arrests under the law suspending the
      writ of habeas corpus were made the texts for harangues on liberty. The
      right of freedom of speech was dragged in when General Van Dorn, in the
      Southwest, threatened with suppression any newspaper that published
      anything which might impair confidence in a commanding officer. How could
      he have dared to do this, was the cry, unless the President was behind
      him? And when General Bragg assumed a similar attitude toward the press,
      the same cry was raised. Throughout the summer of victories, even while
      the thrilling stories of Seven Pines, the Peninsula, Second Manassas, were
      sounding like trumpets, these mutterings of discontent formed an ominous
      accompaniment.

      Yancey, speaking of the disturbed temper of the time, attributed it to the
      general lack of information on the part of Southern people as to what the
      Confederate Government was doing. His proposed remedy was an end of the
      censorship which that Government was attempting to maintain, the
      abandonment of the secret sessions of its Congress, and the taking of the
      people into its full confidence. Now a Senator from Alabama, he attempted,
      at the opening of the congressional session in the autumn of 1862, to
      abolish secret sessions, but in his efforts he was not successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seems little doubt that the Confederate Government had blundered in
      being too secretive. Even from Congress, much information was withheld. A
      curious incident has preserved what appeared to the military mind the
      justification of this reticence. The Secretary of War refused to comply
      with a request for information, holding that he could not do so "without
      disclosing the strength of our armies to many persons of subordinate
      position whose secrecy cannot be relied upon." "I beg leave to remind
      you," said he, "of a report made in response to a similar one from the
      Federal Congress, communicated to them in secret session, and now a part
      of our archives."
    </p>
    <p>
      How much the country was in the dark with regard to some vital matters is
      revealed by an attack on the Confederate Administration which was made by
      the Charleston Mercury, in February. The Southern Government was accused
      of unpardonable slowness in sending agents to Europe to purchase
      munitions. In point of fact, the Confederate Government had been more
      prompt than the Union Government in rushing agents abroad. But the country
      was not permitted to know this. Though the Courier was a government organ
      in Charleston, it did not meet the charges of the Mercury by disclosing
      the facts about the arduous attempts of the Confederate Government to
      secure arms in Europe. The reply of the Courier to the Mercury, though
      spirited, was all in general terms. "To shake confidence in Jefferson
      Davis," said the Courier, "is... to bring 'hideous ruin and combustion'
      down upon our dearest hopes and interests." It made "Mr. Davis and his
      defensive policy" objects of all admiration; called Davis "our Moses." It
      was deeply indignant because it had been "reliably informed that men of
      high official position among us" were "calling for a General Convention of
      the Confederate States to depose him and set up a military Dictator in his
      place." The Mercury retorted that, as to the plot against "our Moses,"
      there was no evidence of its existence except the Courier's assertion.
      Nevertheless, it considered Davis "an incubus to the cause." The
      controversy between the Mercury and the Courier at Charleston was
      paralleled at Richmond by the constant bickering between the government
      organ, the Enquirer, and the Examiner, which shares with the Mercury the
      first place among the newspapers hostile to Davis. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Confederate Government did not misapprehend the
     attitude of the intellectual opposition. Its foreign organ,
     The Index, published in London, characterized the leading
     Southern papers for the enlightenment of the British public.
     While the Enquirer and the Courier were singled out as the
     great champions of the Confederate Government, the Examiner
     and the Mercury were portrayed as its arch enemies. The
     Examiner was called the "Ishmael of the Southern press." The
     Mercury was described as "almost rabid on the subject of
     state rights."
</pre>
    <p>
      Associated with the Examiner was a vigorous writer having considerable
      power of the old-fashioned, furious sort, ever ready to foam at the mouth.
      If he had had more restraint and less credulity, Edward A. Pollard might
      have become a master of the art of vituperation. Lacking these qualities,
      he never rose far above mediocrity. But his fury was so determined and his
      prejudice so invincible that his writings have something of the power of
      conviction which fanaticism wields. In midsummer, 1862, Pollard published
      a book entitled The First Year of the War, which was commended by his
      allies in Charleston as showing no "tendency toward unfairness of
      statement" and as expressing views "mainly in accordance with popular
      opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      This book, while affecting to be an historical review, was skillfully
      designed to discredit the Confederate Administration. Almost every
      disaster, every fault of its management was traceable more or less
      directly to Davis. Kentucky had been occupied by the Federal army because
      of the "dull expectation" in which the Confederate Government had stood
      aside waiting for things somehow to right themselves. The Southern
      Congress had been criminally slow in coming to conscription, contenting
      itself with an army of 400,000 men that existed "on paper." "The most
      distressing abuses were visible in the ill-regulated hygiene of our
      camps." According to this book, the Confederate Administration was solely
      to blame for the loss of Roanoke Island. In calling that disaster "deeply
      humiliating," as he did in a message to Congress, Davis was trying to
      shield his favorite Benjamin at the cost of gallant soldiers who had been
      sacrificed through his incapacity. Davis's promotion of Benjamin to the
      State Department was an act of "ungracious and reckless defiance of
      popular sentiment." The President was "not the man to consult the
      sentiment and wisdom of the people; he desired to signalize the
      infallibility of his own intellect in every measure of the revolution and
      to identify, from motives of vanity, his own personal genius with every
      event and detail of the remarkable period of history in which he had been
      called upon to act. This imperious conceit seemed to swallow up every
      other idea in his mind." The generals "fretted under this pragmatism" of
      one whose "vanity" directed the war "from his cushioned seat in Richmond"
      by means of the one formula, "the defensive policy."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Pollard's chief accusations against the Confederate Government was
      its failure to enforce the conscription law. His paper, the Examiner, as
      well as the Mercury, supported Davis in the policy of conscription, but
      both did their best, first, to rob him of the credit for it and, secondly,
      to make his conduct of the policy appear inefficient. Pollard claimed for
      the Examiner the credit of having originated the policy of conscription;
      the Mercury claimed it for Rhett.
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, an aggressive war party led by the Examiner and the
      Mercury had been formed in those early days when the Confederate
      Government appeared to be standing wholly on the defensive, and when it
      had failed to confide to the people the extenuating circumstance that lack
      of arms compelled it to stand still whether it would or no. And yet, after
      this Government had changed its policy and had taken up in the summer of
      1862 an offensive policy, this party&mdash;or faction, or what you will&mdash;continued
      its career of opposition. That the secretive habit of the Confederate
      Government helped cement the opposition cannot be doubted. It is also
      likely that this opposition gave a vent to certain jealous spirits who had
      missed the first place in leadership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, the issue of state sovereignty had been raised. In Georgia a
      movement had begun which was distinctly different from the
      Virginia-Carolina movement of opposition, a movement for which Rhett and
      Pollard had scarcely more than disdainful tolerance, and not always that.
      This parallel opposition found vent, as did the other, in a political
      pamphlet. On the subject of conscription Davis and the Governor of Georgia&mdash;that
      same Joseph E. Brown who had seized Fort Pulaski in the previous year&mdash;exchanged
      a rancorous correspondence. Their letters were published in a pamphlet of
      which Pollard said scornfully that it was hawked about in every city of
      the South. Brown, taking alarm at the power given the Confederate
      Government by the Conscription Act, eventually defined his position, and
      that of a large following, in the extreme words: "No act of the Government
      of the United States prior to the secession of Georgia struck a blow at
      constitutional liberty so fell as has been stricken by the conscript
      acts."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other elements of discontent which were taking form as early as
      the autumn of 1862 but which were not yet clearly defined. But the two
      obvious sources of internal criticism just described were enough to
      disquiet the most resolute administration. When the triple offensive broke
      down, when the ebb-tide began, there was already everything that was
      needed to precipitate a political crisis. And now the question arises
      whether the Confederate Administration had itself to blame. Had Davis
      proved inadequate in his great undertaking?
    </p>
    <p>
      The one undeniable mistake of the Government previous to the autumn of
      1862 was its excessive secrecy. As to the other mistakes attributed to it
      at the time, there is good reason to call them misfortunes. Today we can
      see that the financial situation, the cotton situation, the relations with
      Europe, the problem of equipping the armies, were all to a considerable
      degree beyond the control of the Confederate Government. If there is
      anything to be added to its mistaken secrecy as a definite cause of
      irritation, it must be found in the general tone given to its actions by
      its chief directors. And here there is something to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all his high qualities of integrity, courage, faithfulness, and zeal,
      Davis lacked that insight into human life which marks the genius of the
      supreme executive. He was not an artist in the use of men. He had not that
      artistic sense of his medium which distinguishes the statesman from the
      bureaucrat. In fact, he had a dangerous bent toward bureaucracy. As Reuben
      Davis said of him, "Gifted with some of the highest attributes of a
      statesman, he lacked the pliancy which enables a man to adapt his measures
      to the crisis." Furthermore, he lacked humor; there was no safety-valve to
      his intense nature; and he was a man of delicate health. Mrs. Davis,
      describing the effects which nervous dyspepsia and neuralgia had upon him,
      says he would come home from his office "fasting, a mere mass of throbbing
      nerves, and perfectly exhausted." And it cannot be denied that his mind
      was dogmatic. Here are dangerous lines for the character of a leader of
      revolution&mdash;the bureaucratic tendency, something of rigidity, lack of
      humor, physical wretchedness, dogmatism. Taken together, they go far
      toward explaining his failure in judging men, his irritable confidence in
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no slight detail of a man's career to be placed side by side with a
      genius of the first rank without knowing it. But Davis does not seem ever
      to have appreciated that the man commanding in the Seven Days' Battles was
      one of the world's supreme characters. The relation between Davis and Lee
      was always cordial, and it brought out Davis's character in its best
      light. Nevertheless, so rooted was Davis's faith in his own abilities that
      he was capable of saying, at a moment of acutest anxiety, "If I could take
      one wing and Lee the other, I think we could between us wrest a victory
      from those people." And yet, his military experience embraced only the
      minor actions of a young officer on the Indian frontier and the gallant
      conduct of a subordinate in the Mexican War. He had never executed a great
      military design. His desire for the military life was, after all, his only
      ground for ranking himself with the victor of Second Manassas. Davis was
      also unfortunate in lacking the power to overcome men and sweep them along
      with him&mdash;the power Lee showed so conspicuously. Nor was Davis averse
      to sharp reproof of the highest officials when he thought them in the
      wrong. He once wrote to Joseph E. Johnston that a letter of his contained
      "arguments and statements utterly unfounded" and "insinuations as
      unfounded as they were unbecoming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davis was not always wise in his choice of men. His confidence in Bragg,
      who was long his chief military adviser, is not sustained by the military
      critics of a later age. His Cabinet, though not the contemptible body
      caricatured by the malice of Pollard, was not equal to the occasion. Of
      the three men who held the office of Secretary of State, Toombs and Hunter
      had little if any qualification for such a post, while the third,
      Benjamin, is the sphinx of Confederate history.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a way, Judah P. Benjamin is one of the most interesting men in American
      politics. By descent a Jew, born in the West Indies, he spent his boyhood
      mainly at Charleston and his college days at Yale. He went to New Orleans
      to begin his illustrious career as a lawyer, and from Louisiana entered
      politics. The facile keenness of his intellect is beyond dispute. He had
      the Jewish clarity of thought, the wonderful Jewish detachment in matters
      of pure mind. But he was also an American of the middle of the century.
      His quick and responsive nature&mdash;a nature that enemies might call
      simulative&mdash;caught and reflected the characteristics of that singular
      and highly rhetorical age. He lives in tradition as the man of the
      constant smile, and yet there is no one in history whose state papers
      contain passages of fiercer violence in days of tension. How much of his
      violence was genuine, how much was a manner of speaking, his biographers
      have not had the courage to determine. Like so many American biographers
      they have avoided the awkward questions and have glanced over, as lightly
      as possible, the persistent attempts of Congress to drive him from office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could shake the resolution of Davis to retain Benjamin in the
      Cabinet. Among Davis's loftiest qualities was his sense of personal
      loyalty. Once he had given his confidence, no amount of opposition could
      shake his will but served rather to harden him. When Benjamin as Secretary
      of War passed under a cloud, Davis led him forth resplendent as Secretary
      of State. Whether he was wise in doing so, whether the opposition was not
      justified in its distrust of Benjamin, is still an open question. What is
      certain is that both these able men, even before the crisis that arose in
      the autumn of 1862, had rendered themselves and their Government widely
      unpopular. It must never be forgotten that Davis entered office without
      the backing of any definite faction. He was a "dark horse," a compromise
      candidate. To build up a stanch following, to create enthusiasm for his
      Administration, was a prime necessity of his first year as President. Yet
      he seems not to have realized this necessity. Boldly, firmly,
      dogmatically, he gave his whole thought and his entire energy to
      organizing the Government in such a way that it could do its work
      efficiently. And therein may have been the proverbial rift within the
      lute. To Davis statecraft was too much a thing of methods and measures,
      too little a thing of men and passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the autumn of 1862 and the following winter the disputes over the
      conduct of the war began to subside and two other themes became prominent:
      the sovereignty of the States, which appeared to be menaced by the
      Government, and the personality of Davis, whom malcontents regarded as a
      possible despot. Contrary to tradition, the first note of alarm over state
      rights was not struck by its great apostle Rhett, although the note was
      sounded in South Carolina in the early autumn. There existed in this State
      at that time an extra assembly called the "Convention," which had been
      organized in 1860 for the general purpose of seeing the State through the
      "revolution." In the Convention, in September, 1862, the question of a
      contest with the Confederate Government on the subject of a state army was
      definitely raised. It was proposed to organize a state army and to
      instruct the Legislature to "take effectual measures to prevent the agents
      of the Confederate Government from raising troops in South Carolina except
      by voluntary enlistment or by applying to the Executive of the State to
      call out the militia as by law organized, or some part of it to be
      mustered into the Confederate service." This proposal brought about a
      sharp debate upon the Confederate Government and its military policy.
      Rhett made a remarkable address, which should of itself quiet forever the
      old tale that he was animated in his opposition solely by the pique of a
      disappointed candidate for the presidency. Though as sharp as ever against
      the Government and though agreeing wholly with the spirit of the state
      army plan, he took the ground that circumstances at the moment rendered
      the organization of such an army inopportune. A year earlier he would have
      strongly supported the plan. In fact, in opposition to Davis he had at
      that time, he said, urged an obligatory army which the States should be
      required to raise. The Confederate Administration, however, had defeated
      his scheme. Since then the situation had changed and had become so serious
      that now there was no choice but to submit to military necessity. He
      regarded the general conscription law as "absolutely necessary to save"
      the Confederacy "from utter devastation if not final subjugation. Right or
      wrong, the policy of the Administration had left us no other
      alternative...."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dominant attitude in South Carolina in the autumn of 1862 is in strong
      contrast, because of its firm grasp upon fact, with the attitude of the
      Brown faction in Georgia. An extended history of the Confederate movement&mdash;one
      of those vast histories that delight the recluse and scare away the man of
      the world&mdash;would labor to build up images of what might be called the
      personalities of the four States that continued from the beginning to the
      end parts of the effective Confederate system&mdash;Virginia, the two
      Carolinas, and Georgia. We are prone to forget that the Confederacy was
      practically divided into separate units as early as the capture of New
      Orleans by Farragut, but a great history of the time would have a special
      and thrilling story of the conduct of the detached western unit, the
      isolated world of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas&mdash;the "Department of
      the Trans-Mississippi"&mdash;cut off from the main body of the Confederacy
      and hemmed in between the Federal army and the deep sea. Another group of
      States&mdash;Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama&mdash;became so soon, and
      remained so long, a debatable land, on which the two armies fought, that
      they also had scant opportunity for genuine political life. Florida, small
      and exposed, was absorbed in its gallant achievement of furnishing to the
      armies a number of soldiers larger than its voting population.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, after the loss of New Orleans, one thing with another operated to
      confine the area of full political life to Virginia and her three
      neighbors to the South. And yet even among these States there was no
      political solidarity or unanimity of opinion, for the differences in their
      past experience, social structure, and economic conditions made for
      distinct points of view. In South Carolina, particularly, the prevailing
      view was that of experienced, disillusioned men who realized from the
      start that secession had burnt their bridges, and that now they must win
      the fight or change the whole current of their lives. In the midst of the
      extraordinary conditions of war, they never talked as if their problems
      were the problems of peace. Brown, on the other hand, had but one way of
      reasoning&mdash;if we are to call it reasoning&mdash;and, with Hannibal at
      the gates, talked as if the control of the situation were still in his own
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      While South Carolina, so grimly conscious of the reality of war and the
      danger of internal discord, held off from the issue of state sovereignty,
      the Brown faction in Georgia blithely pressed it home. A bill for
      extending the conscription age which was heartily advocated by the Mercury
      was as heartily condemned by Brown. To the President he wrote announcing
      his continued opposition to a law which he declared "encroaches upon the
      reserved rights of the State and strikes down her sovereignty at a single
      blow." Though the Supreme Court of Georgia pronounced the conscription
      acts constitutional, the Governor and his faction did not cease to condemn
      them. Linton Stephens, as well as his famous kinsman, took up the cudgels.
      In a speech before the Georgia Legislature, in November, Linton Stephens
      borrowed almost exactly the Governor's phraseology in denying the
      necessity for conscription, and this continued to be the note of their
      faction throughout the war. "Conscription checks enthusiasm," was ever
      their cry; "we are invincible under a system of volunteering, we are lost
      with conscription."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the military authorities looked facts in the face and had a
      different tale to tell. They complained that in various parts of the
      country, especially in the mountain districts, they were unable to obtain
      men. Lee reported that his army melted away before his eye and asked for
      an increase of authority to compel stragglers to return. At the same time
      Brown was quarreling with the Administration as to who should name the
      officers of the Georgia troops. Zebulon B. Vance, the newly elected
      Governor of North Carolina and an anti-Davis man, said to the Legislature:
      "It is mortifying to find entire brigades of North Carolina soldiers
      commanded by strangers, and in many cases our own brave and war-worn
      colonels are made to give place to colonels from distant States." In
      addition to such indications of discontent a vast mass of evidence makes
      plain the opposition to conscription toward the close of 1862 and the
      looseness of various parts of the military system.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment of intense excitement and of nervous strain. The country
      was unhappy, for it had lost faith in the Government at Richmond. The
      blockade was producing its effect. European intervention was receding into
      the distance. One of the characteristics of the editorials and speeches of
      this period is a rising tide of bitterness against England. Napoleon's
      proposal in November to mediate, though it came to naught, somewhat
      revived the hope of an eventual recognition of the Confederacy but did not
      restore buoyancy to the people of the South. The Emancipation
      Proclamation, though scoffed at as a cry of impotence, none the less
      increased the general sense of crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worst of all, because of its immediate effect upon the temper of the time,
      food was very scarce and prices had risen to indefensible heights. The
      army was short of shoes. In the newspapers, as winter came on, were to be
      found touching descriptions of Lee's soldiers standing barefoot in the
      snow. A flippant comment of Benjamin's, that the shoes had probably been
      traded for whiskey, did not tend to improve matters. Even though short of
      supplies themselves, the people as a whole eagerly subscribed to buy shoes
      for the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was widespread and heartless speculation in the supplies. Months
      previous the Courier had made this ominous editorial remark: "Speculators
      and monopolists seem determined to force the people everywhere to the full
      exercise of all the remedies allowed by law." In August, 1862, the
      Governor of Florida wrote to the Florida delegation at Richmond urging
      them to take steps to meet the "nefarious smuggling" of speculators who
      charged extortionate prices. In September, he wrote again begging for
      legislation to compel millers, tanners, and saltmakers to offer their
      products at reasonable rates. As these men were exempt from military duty
      because their labor was held to be a public service, feeling against them
      ran high. Governor Vance proposed a state convention to regulate prices
      for North Carolina and by proclamation forbade the export of provisions in
      order to prevent the seeking of exorbitant prices in other markets. Davis
      wrote to various Governors urging them to obtain state legislation to
      reduce extortion in the food business. In the provisioning of the army the
      Confederate Government had recourse to impressment and the arbitrary
      fixing of prices. Though the Attorney-General held this action to be
      constitutional, it led to sharp contentions; and at length a Virginia
      court granted an injunction to a speculator who had been paid by the
      Government for flour less than it had cost him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an attempt to straighten out this tangled situation, the Confederate
      Government began, late, in 1862, by appointing as its new Secretary of
      War, * James A. Seddon of Virginia&mdash;at that time high in popular
      favor. The Mercury hailed his advent with transparent relief, for no
      appointment could have seemed to it more promising. Indeed, as the new
      year (1863) opened the Mercury was in better humor with the Administration
      than perhaps at any other time during the war. To the President's message
      it gave praise that was almost cordial. This amicable temper was
      short-lived, however, and three months later the heavens had clouded.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * There were in all six Secretaries of War: Leroy P. Walker,
     until September 16, 1861; Judah P. Benjamin, until March 18,
     1862; George W. Randolph, until November 17, 1868; Gustavus
     W. Smith (temporarily), until November 21, 1862; James A.
     Seddon, until February 6, 1865; General John C.
     Breckinridge, again, for the Government had entered upon a
     course that consolidated the opposition in anger and
     distrust.
</pre>
    <p>
      Early in 1863 the Confederate Government presented to the country a
      program in which the main features were three. Of these the two which did
      not rouse immediate hostility in the party of the Examiner and the Mercury
      were the Impressment Act of March, 1863 (amended by successive acts), and
      the act known as the Tax in Kind, which was approved the following month.
      Though the Impressment Act subsequently made vast trouble for the
      Government, at the time of its passage its beneficial effects were not
      denied. To it was attributed by the Richmond Whig the rapid fall of prices
      in April, 1863. Corn went down at Richmond from $12 and $10 a bushel to
      $4.20, and flour dropped in North Carolina from $45 a barrel to $25. Under
      this act commissioners were appointed in each State jointly by the
      Confederate President and the Governor with the duty of fixing prices for
      government transactions and of publishing every two months an official
      schedule of the prices to be paid by the Government for the supplies which
      it impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new Tax Act attempted to provide revenues which should not be paid in
      depreciated currency. With no bullion to speak of, the Confederate
      Congress could not establish a circulating medium with even an
      approximation to constant value. Realizing this situation, Memminger had
      advised falling back on the ancient system of tithes and the support of
      the Government by direct contributions of produce. After licensing a great
      number of occupations and laying a property tax and an income tax, the new
      law demanded a tenth of the produce of all farmers. On this law the
      Mercury pronounced a benediction in an editorial on The Fall of Prices,
      which it attributed to "the healthy influence of the tax bill which has
      just become law." *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The fall of prices was attributed by others to a funding
     act,&mdash;one of several passed by the Confederate Congress&mdash;
     which, in March, 1863, aimed by various devices to contract
     the volume of the currency. It was very generally condemned,
     and it anticipated the yet more drastic measure, the Funding
     Act of 1864, which will be described later.
</pre>
    <p>
      Had these two measures been the whole program of the Government, the
      congressional session of the spring of 1863 would have had a different
      significance in Confederate history. But there was a third measure that
      provoked a new attack on the Government. The gracious words of the Mercury
      on the tax in kind came as an interlude in the midst of a bitter
      controversy. An editorial of the 12th of March headed "A Despotism over
      the Confederate States Proposed in Congress" amounted to a declaration of
      war. From this time forward the opposition and the Government drew
      steadily further and further apart and their antagonism grew steadily more
      relentless.
    </p>
    <p>
      What caused this irrevocable breach was a bill introduced into the House
      by Ethelbert Barksdale of Mississippi, an old friend of President Davis.
      This bill would have invested the President with authority to suspend the
      privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in any part of the Confederacy,
      whenever in his judgment such suspension was desirable. The first act
      suspending the privilege of habeas corpus had long since expired and
      applied only to such regions as were threatened with invasion. It had
      served usefully under martial law in cleansing Richmond of its rogues, and
      also had been in force at Charleston. The Mercury had approved it and had
      exhorted its readers to take the matter sensibly as an inevitable detail
      of war. Between that act and the act now proposed the Mercury saw no
      similarity. Upon the merits of the question it fought a furious
      journalistic duel with the Enquirer, the government organ at Richmond,
      which insisted that President Davis would not abuse his power. The Mercury
      replied that if he "were a second Washington, or an angel upon earth, the
      degradation such a surrender of our rights implies would still be
      abhorrent to every freeman." In retort the Enquirer pointed out that a
      similar law had been enacted by another Congress with no bad results. And
      in point of fact the Enquirer was right, for in October, 1862, after the
      expiration of the first act suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas
      corpus, Congress passed a second giving to the President the immense power
      which was now claimed for him again. This second act was in force several
      months. Then the Mercury made the astounding declaration that it had never
      heard of the second act, and thereupon proceeded to attack the secrecy of
      the Administration with renewed vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this issue of reviving the expired second Habeas Corpus Act, a battle
      royal was fought in the Confederate Congress. The forces of the
      Administration defended the new measure on the ground that various regions
      were openly seditious and that conscription could not be enforced without
      it. This argument gave a new text for the cry of "despotism." The
      congressional leader of the opposition was Henry S. Foote, once the rival
      of Davis in Mississippi and now a citizen of Tennessee. Fierce,
      vindictive, sometimes convincing, always shrewd, he was a powerful leader
      of the rough and ready, buccaneering sort. Under his guidance the debate
      was diverted into a rancorous discussion of the conduct of the general's
      in the execution of martial law. Foote pulled out all the stops in the
      organ of political rhetoric and went in for a chant royal of righteous
      indignation. The main object of this attack was General Hindman and his
      doings in Arkansas. Those were still the days of pamphleteering. Though
      General Albert Pike had written a severe pamphlet condemning Hindman, to
      this pamphlet the Confederate Government had shut its eyes. Foote,
      however, flourished it in the face of the House. He thundered forth his
      belief that Hindman was worse even than the man most detested in the
      South, than "beast Butler himself, for the latter is only charged with
      persecuting and oppressing the avowed enemies of his Government, while
      Hindman, if guilty as charged, has practised cruelties unnumbered" on his
      people. Other representatives spoke in the same vein. Baldwin of Virginia
      told harrowing tales of martial law in that State. Barksdale attempted to
      retaliate, sarcastically reminding him of a recent scene of riot and
      disorder which proved that martial law, in any effective form, did not
      exist in Virginia. He alluded to a riot, ostensibly for bread, in which an
      Amazonian woman had led a mob to the pillaging of the Richmond jewelry
      shops, a riot which Davis himself had quelled by meeting the rioters and
      threatening to fire upon them. But sarcasm proved powerless against Foote.
      His climax was a lurid tale of a soldier who while marching past his own
      house heard that his wife was dying, who left the ranks for a last word
      with her, and who on rejoining the command, "hoping to get permission to
      bury her," was shot as a deserter. And there was no one on the Government
      benches to anticipate Kipling and cry out "flat art!" Resolutions
      condemning martial law were passed by a vote of 45 to 27.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks later the Mercury preached a burial sermon over the Barksdale
      Bill, which had now been rejected by the House. Congress was about to
      adjourn, and before it reassembled elections for the next House would be
      held. "The measure is dead for the present," said the Mercury, "but power
      is ever restive and prone to accumulate power; and if the war continues,
      other efforts will doubtless be made to make the President a Dictator. Let
      the people keep their eyes steadily fixed on their representatives with
      respect to this vital matter; and should the effort again be made to
      suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, demand that a recorded vote should show
      those who shall strike down their liberties."

    <h2>
      Chapter V. The Critical Year
    </h2>
    <p>
      The great military events of the year 1863 have pushed out of men's
      memories the less dramatic but scarcely less important civil events. To
      begin with, in this year two of the greatest personalities in the South
      passed from the political stage: in the summer Yancey died; and in the
      autumn, Rhett went into retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ever malicious Pollard insists that Yancey's death was due ultimately
      to a personal encounter with a Senator from Georgia on the floor of the
      Senate. The curious may find the discreditable story embalmed in the
      secret journal of the Senate, where are the various motions designed to
      keep the incident from the knowledge of the world. Whether it really
      caused Yancey's death is another question. However, the moment of his
      passing has dramatic significance. Just as the battle over conscription
      was fully begun, when the fear that the Confederate Government had arrayed
      itself against the rights of the States had definitely taken shape, when
      this dread had been reenforced by the alarm over the suspension of habeas
      corpus, the great pioneer of the secession movement went to his grave,
      despairing of the country he had failed to lead. His death occurred in the
      same month as the Battle of Gettysburg, at the very time when the
      Confederacy was dividing against itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The withdrawal of Rhett from active life was an incident of the
      congressional elections. He had consented to stand for Congress in the
      Third District of South Carolina but was defeated. The full explanation of
      the vote is still to be made plain; it seems clear, however, that South
      Carolina at this time knew its own mind quite positively. Five of the six
      representatives returned to the Second Congress, including Rhett's
      opponent, Lewis M. Ayer, had sat in the First Congress. The subsequent
      history of the South Carolina delegation and of the State Government shows
      that by 1863 South Carolina had become, broadly speaking, on almost all
      issues an anti-Davis State. And yet the largest personality and probably
      the ablest mind in the State was rejected as a candidate for Congress. No
      character in American history is a finer challenge to the biographer than
      this powerful figure of Rhett, who in 1861 at the supreme crisis of his
      life seemed the master of his world and yet in every lesser crisis was a
      comparative failure. As in Yancey, so in Rhett, there was something that
      fitted him to one great moment but did not fit him to others. There can be
      little doubt that his defeat at the polls of his own district deeply
      mortified him. He withdrew from politics, and though he doubtless, through
      the editorship of one of his sons, inspired the continued opposition of
      the Mercury to the Government, Rhett himself hardly reappears in
      Confederate history except for a single occasion during the debate a year
      later upon the burning question of arming the slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year was marked by very bitter attacks upon President Davis on the
      part of the opposition press. The Mercury revived the issue of the conduct
      of the war which had for some time been overshadowed by other issues. In
      the spring, to be sure, things had begun to look brighter, and
      Chancellorsville had raised Lee's reputation to its zenith. The disasters
      of the summer, Gettysburg and Vicksburg, were for a time minimized by the
      Government and do not appear to have caused the alarm which their
      strategic importance might well have created. But when in the latter days
      of July the facts became generally known, the Mercury arraigned the
      President's conduct of the war as "a vast complication of incompetence and
      folly"; it condemned the whole scheme of the Northern invasion and
      maintained that Lee should have stood on the defensive while twenty or
      thirty thousand men were sent to the relief of Vicksburg. These two ideas
      it bitterly reiterated and in August went so far as to quote Macaulay's
      famous passage on Parliament's dread of a decisive victory over Charles
      and to apply it to Davis in unrestrained language that reminds one of
      Pollard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally unrestrained were the attacks upon other items of the policy of
      the Confederate Government. The Impressment Law began to be a target.
      Farmers who were compelled to accept the prices fixed by the impressment
      commissioners cried out that they were being ruined. Men of the stamp of
      Toombs came to their assistance with railing accusations such as this: "I
      have heard it said that we should not sacrifice liberty to independence,
      but I tell you, my countrymen, that the two are inseparable.... If we lose
      our liberty we shall lose our independence.... I would rather see the
      whole country the cemetery of freedom than the habitation of slaves."
      Protests which poured in upon the Government insisted that the power to
      impress supplies did not carry with it the power to fix prices. Worthy
      men, ridden by the traditional ideas of political science and unable to
      modify these in the light of the present emergency, wailed out their
      despair over the "usurpation" of Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tax in kind was denounced in the same vein. The licensing provisions
      of this law and its income tax did not satisfy the popular imagination.
      These provisions concerned the classes that could borrow. The classes that
      could not borrow, that had no resources but their crops, felt that they
      were being driven to the wall. The bitter saying went around that it was
      "a rich man's war and a poor man's fight." As land and slaves were not
      directly taxed, the popular discontent appeared to have ground for its
      anger. Furthermore, it must never be forgotten that this was the first
      general tax that the poor people of the South were ever conscious of
      paying. To people who knew the tax-gatherer as little more than a mythical
      being, he suddenly appeared like a malevolent creature who swept off
      ruthlessly the tenth of their produce. It is not strange that an
      intemperate reaction against the planters and their leadership followed.
      The illusion spread that they were not doing their share of the fighting;
      and as rich men were permitted to hire substitutes to represent them in
      the army, this really baseless report was easily propped up in the public
      mind with what appeared to be reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      In North Carolina, where the peasant farmer was a larger political factor
      than in any other State, this feeling against the Confederate Government
      because of the tax in kind was most dangerous. In the course of the
      summer, while the military fortunes of the Confederacy were toppling at
      Vicksburg and Gettysburg, the North Carolina farmers in a panic of
      self-preservation held numerous meetings of protest and denunciation. They
      expressed their thoughtless terror in resolutions asserting that the
      action of Congress "in secret session, without consulting with their
      constituents at home, taking from the hard laborers of the Confederacy
      one-tenth of the people's living, instead of taking back their own
      currency in tax, is unjust and tyrannical." Other resolutions called the
      tax "unconstitutional, anti-republican, and oppressive"; and still others
      pledged the farmers "to resist to the bitter end any such monarchical
      tax."
    </p>
    <p>
      A leader of the discontented in North Carolina was found in W. W. Holden,
      the editor of the Raleigh Progress, who before the war had attempted to be
      spokesman for the men of small property by advocating taxes on slaves and
      similar measures. He proposed as the conclusion of the whole matter the
      opening of negotiations for peace. We shall see later how deep-seated was
      this singular delusion that peace could be had for the asking. In 1863,
      however, many men in North Carolina took up the suggestion with delight.
      Jonathan Worth wrote in his diary, on hearing that the influential North
      Carolina Standard had come out for peace: "I still abhor, as I always did,
      this accursed war and the wicked men, North and South, who inaugurated it.
      The whole country at the North and the South is a great military
      despotism." With such discontent in the air, the elections in North
      Carolina drew near. The feeling was intense and riots occurred. Newspaper
      offices were demolished&mdash;among them Holden's, to destroy which a
      detachment of passing soldiers converted itself into a mob. In the western
      counties deserters from the army, combined in bands, were joined by other
      deserters from Tennessee, and terrorized the countryside. Governor Vance,
      alarmed at the progress which this disorder was making, issued a
      proclamation imploring his rebellious countrymen to conduct in a peaceable
      manner their campaign for the repeal of obnoxious laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The measure of political unrest in North Carolina was indicated in the
      autumn when a new delegation to Congress was chosen. Of the ten who
      composed it, eight were new men. Though they did not stand for a clearly
      defined program, they represented on the whole anti-Davis tendencies. The
      Confederate Administration had failed to carry the day in the North
      Carolina elections; and in Georgia there were even more sweeping evidences
      of unrest. Of the ten representatives chosen for the Second Congress nine
      had not sat in the First, and Georgia now was in the main frankly
      anti-Davis. There had been set up at Richmond a new organ of the
      Government called the Sentinel, which was more entirely under the
      presidential shadow than even the Enquirer and the Courier. Speaking of
      the elections, the Sentinel deplored the "upheaval of political elements"
      revealed by the defeat of so many tried representatives whose constituents
      had not returned them to the Second Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was Davis doing while the ground was thus being cut from under his
      feet? For one thing he gave his endorsement to the formation of
      "Confederate Societies" whose members bound themselves to take Confederate
      money as legal tender. He wrote a letter to one such society in
      Mississippi, praising it for attempting "by common consent to bring down
      the prices of all articles to the standard of the soldiers' wages" and
      adding that the passion of speculation had "seduced citizens of all
      classes from a determined prosecution of the war to an effort to amass
      money." The Sentinel advocated the establishment of a law fixing maximum
      prices. The discussion of this proposal seems to make plain the raison
      d'etre for the existence of the Sentinel. Even such stanch government
      organs as the Enquirer and the Courier shied at the idea, but the Mercury
      denounced it vigorously, giving long extracts from Thiers, and discussed
      the mistakes, of the French Revolution with its "law of maximum."
    </p>
    <p>
      Davis, however, did not take an active part in the political campaign, nor
      did the other members of the Government. It was not because of any notion
      that the President should not leave the capital that Davis did not visit
      the disaffected regions of North Carolina when the startled populace
      winced under its first experience with taxation. Three times during his
      Administration Davis left Richmond on extended journeys: late in 1862,
      when Vicksburg had become a chief concern of the Government, he went as
      far afield as Mississippi in order to get entirely in touch with the
      military situation in those parts; in the month of October, 1863, when
      there was another moment of intense military anxiety, Davis again visited
      the front; and of a third journey which he undertook in 1864, we shall
      hear in time. It is to be noted that each of these journeys was prompted
      by a military motive; and here, possibly, we get an explanation of his
      inadequacy as a statesman. He could not lay aside his interest in military
      affairs for the supremely important concerns of civil office; and he
      failed to understand how to ingratiate his Administration by personal
      appeals to popular imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October, 1863,&mdash;the very month in which his old rival Rhett
      suffered his final defeat,&mdash;Davis undertook a journey because Bragg,
      after his great victory at Chickamauga, appeared to be letting slip a
      golden opportunity, and because there were reports of dissension among
      Bragg's officers and of general confusion in his army. After he had, as he
      thought, restored harmony in the camp, Davis turned southward on a tour of
      appeal and inspiration. He went as far as Mobile, and returning bent his
      course through Charleston, where, at the beginning of November, less than
      two weeks after Rhett's defeat, Davis was received with all due
      formalities. Members of the Rhett family were among those who formally
      received the President at the railway station. There was a parade of
      welcome, an official reception, a speech by the President from the steps
      of the city hall, and much applause by friends of the Administration. But
      certain ominous signs were not lacking. The Mercury, for example, tucked
      away in an obscure column its account of the event, while its rival, the
      Courier, made the President's visit the feature of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davis returned to Richmond, early in November, to throw himself again with
      his whole soul into problems that were chiefly military. He did not
      realize that the crisis had come and gone and that he had failed to grasp
      the significance of the internal political situation. The Government had
      failed to carry the elections and to secure a working majority in
      Congress. Never again was it to have behind it a firm and confident
      support, The unity of the secession movement had passed away. Thereafter
      the Government was always to be regarded with suspicion by the extreme
      believers in state sovereignty and by those who were sullenly convinced
      that the burdens of the war were unfairly distributed. And there were not
      wanting men who were ready to construe each emergency measure as a step
      toward a coup d'etat.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI. Life In The Confederacy
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the fortunes of the Confederacy in both camp and council began to
      ebb, the life of the Southern people had already profoundly changed. The
      gallant, delightful, carefree life of the planter class had been
      undermined by a war which was eating away its foundations. Economic no
      less than political forces were taking from the planter that ideal of
      individual liberty as dear to his heart as it had been, ages before, to
      his feudal prototype. One of the most important details of the changing
      situation had been the relation of the Government to slavery. The history
      of the Confederacy had opened with a clash between the extreme advocates
      of slavery&mdash;the slavery-at-any-price men&mdash;and the
      Administration. The Confederate Congress had passed a bill ostensibly to
      make effective the clause in its constitution prohibiting the African
      slave-trade. The quick eye of Davis had detected in it a mode of evasion,
      for cargoes of captured slaves were to be confiscated and sold at public
      auction. The President had exposed this adroit subterfuge in his message
      vetoing the bill, and the slavery-at-any-price men had not sufficient
      influence in Congress to override the veto, though they muttered against
      it in the public press.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slavery-at-any-price men did not again conspicuously show their hands
      until three years later when the Administration included emancipation in
      its policy. The ultimate policy of emancipation was forced upon the
      Government by many considerations but more particularly by the difficulty
      of securing labor for military purposes. In a country where the supply of
      fighting men was limited and the workers were a class apart, the
      Government had to employ the only available laborers or confess its
      inability to meet the industrial demands of war. But the available
      laborers were slaves. How could their services be secured? By purchase? Or
      by conscription? Or by temporary impressment?
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Davis and his advisers were prepared to face all the hazards
      involved in the purchase or confiscation of slaves, the traditional
      Southern temper instantly recoiled from the suggestion. A Government
      possessed of great numbers of slaves, whether bought or appropriated,
      would have in its hands a gigantic power, perhaps for industrial
      competition with private owners, perhaps even for organized military
      control. Besides, the Government might at any moment by emancipating its
      slaves upset the labor system of the country. Furthermore, the
      opportunities for favoritism in the management of state-owned slaves were
      beyond calculation. Considerations such as these therefore explain the
      watchful jealousy of the planters toward the Government whenever it
      proposed to acquire property in slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is essential not to attribute this social-political dread of government
      ownership of slaves merely to the clutch of a wealthy class on its
      property. Too many observers, strangely enough, see the latter motive to
      the exclusion of the former. Davis himself was not, it would seem, free
      from this confusion. He insisted that neither slaves nor land were taxed
      by the Confederacy, and between the lines he seems to attribute to the
      planter class the familiar selfishness of massed capital. He forgot that
      the tax in kind was combined with an income tax. In theory, at least, the
      slave and the land&mdash;even non-farming land&mdash;were taxed. However,
      the dread of a slave-owning Government prevented any effective plan for
      supplying the army with labor except through the temporary impressment of
      slaves who were eventually to be returned to their owners. The policy of
      emancipation had to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bound up in the labor question was the question of the control of slaves
      during the war. In the old days when there were plenty of white men in the
      countryside, the roads were carefully patrolled at night, and no slave
      ventured to go at large unless fully prepared to prove his identity. But
      with the coming of war the comparative smallness of the fighting
      population made it likely from the first that the countryside everywhere
      would be stripped of its white guardians. In that event, who would be left
      to control the slaves? Early in the war a slave police was provided for by
      exempting from military duty overseers in the ratio approximately of one
      white to twenty slaves. But the marvelous faithfulness of the slaves, who
      nowhere attempted to revolt, made these precautions unnecessary. Later
      laws exempted one overseer on every plantation of fifteen slaves, not so
      much to perform patrol duty as to increase the productivity of plantation
      labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This "Fifteen Slave" Law was one of many instances that were caught up by
      the men of small property as evidence that the Government favored the
      rich. A much less defensible law, and one which was bitterly attacked for
      the same reason, was the unfortunate measure permitting the hiring of
      substitutes by men drafted into the army. Eventually, the clamor against
      this law caused its repeal, but before that time it had worked untold harm
      as apparent evidence of "a rich man's war and a poor man's fight."
      Extravagant stories of the avoidance of military duty by the ruling class,
      though in the main they were mere fairy tales, changed the whole
      atmosphere of Southern life. The old glad confidence uniting the planter
      class with the bulk of the people had been impaired. Misapprehension
      appeared on both sides. Too much has been said lately, however, in
      justification of the poorer classes who were thus wakened suddenly to a
      distrust of the aristocracy; and too little has been said of the proud
      recoil of the aristocracy in the face of a sudden, credulous perversion of
      its motives&mdash;a perversion inspired by the pinching of the shoe, and
      yet a shoe that pinched one class as hard as it did another. It is as
      unfair to charge the planter with selfishness in opposing the
      appropriation of slaves as it is to make the same charge against the small
      farmers for resisting tithes. In face of the record, the planter comes off
      somewhat the better of the two; but it must be remembered that he had the
      better education, the larger mental horizon.

      The Confederacy had long recognized women of all classes as the most
      dauntless defenders of the cause. The women of the upper classes passed
      without a tremor from a life of smiling ease to a life of extreme
      hardship. One day, their horizon was without a cloud; another day, their
      husbands and fathers had gone to the front. Their luxuries had
      disappeared, and they were reduced to plain hard living, toiling in a
      thousand ways to find provision and clothing, not only for their own
      children but for the poorer families of soldiers. The women of the poor
      throughout the South deserve similar honor. Though the physical shock of
      the change may not have been so great, they had to face the same deep
      realities&mdash;hunger and want, anxiety over the absent soldiers,
      solicitude for children, grief for the dead. One of the pathetic aspects
      of Confederate life was the household composed of several families, all
      women and children, huddled together without a man or even a half-grown
      lad to be their link with the mill and the market. In those regions where
      there were few slaves and the exemption of overseers did not operate, such
      households were numerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great privations which people endured during the Confederacy have
      passed into familiar tradition. They are to be traced mainly to three
      causes: to the blockade, to the inadequate system of transportation, and
      to the heartlessness of speculators. The blockade was the real destroyer
      of the South. Besides ruining the whole policy based on King Cotton,
      besides impeding to a vast extent the inflow of munitions from Europe, it
      also deprived Southern life of numerous articles which were hard to
      relinquish&mdash;not only such luxuries as tea and coffee, but also such
      utter necessities as medicines. And though the native herbs were
      diligently studied, though the Government established medical laboratories
      with results that were not inconsiderable, the shortage of medicines
      remained throughout the war a distressing feature of Southern life. The
      Tredegar Iron Works at Richmond and a foundry at Selma, Alabama, were the
      only mills in the South capable of casting the heavy ordnance necessary
      for military purposes. And the demand for powder mills and gun factories
      to provide for the needs of the army was scarcely greater than the demand
      for cotton mills and commercial foundries to supply the wants of the civil
      population. The Government worked without ceasing to keep pace with the
      requirements of the situation, and, in view of the immense difficulties
      which it had to face, it was fairly successful in supplying the needs of
      the army. Powder was provided by the Niter and Mining Bureau; lead for
      Confederate bullets was collected from many sources&mdash;even from the
      window-weights of the houses; iron was brought from the mines of Alabama;
      guns came from newly built factories; and machines and tools were part of
      the precious freight of the blockade-runners. Though the poorly equipped
      mills turned a portion of the cotton crop into textiles, and though
      everything that was possible was done to meet the needs of the people, the
      supply of manufactures was sadly inadequate. The universal shortage was
      betrayed by the limitation of the size of most newspapers to a single
      sheet, and the desperate situation clearly and completely revealed by the
      way in which, as a last resort, the Confederates were compelled to repair
      their railroads by pulling up the rails of one road in order to repair
      another that the necessities of war rendered indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The railway system, if such it can be called, was one of the weaknesses of
      the Confederacy. Before the war the South had not felt the need of
      elaborate interior communication, for its commerce in the main went
      seaward, and thence to New England or to Europe. Hitherto the railway
      lines had seen no reason for merging their local character in extensive
      combinations. Owners of short lines were inclined by tradition to resist
      even the imperative necessities of war and their stubborn conservatism was
      frequently encouraged by the shortsighted parochialism of the towns. The
      same pitiful narrowness that led the peasant farmer to threaten rebellion
      against the tax in kind led his counterpart in the towns to oppose the War
      Department in its efforts to establish through railroad lines because they
      threatened to impair local business interests. A striking instance of this
      disinclination towards cooperation is the action of Petersburg. Two
      railroads terminated at this point but did not connect, and it was an
      ardent desire of the military authorities to link the two and convert them
      into one. The town, however, unable to see beyond its boundaries and
      resolute in its determination to save its transfer business, successfully
      obstructed the needs of the army. *

     Railroads" in the "American Historical Review," July, 1917,
     by Charles W. Ramsdell.
</pre>
    <p>
      As a result of this lack of efficient organization an immense congestion
      resulted all along the railroads. Whether this, rather than a failure in
      supply, explains the approach of famine in the latter part of the war, it
      is today very difficult to determine. In numerous state papers of the
      time, the assertion was reiterated that the yield of food was abundant and
      that the scarcity of food at many places, including the cities and the
      battle fronts, was due to defects in transportation. Certain it is that
      the progress of supplies from one point to another was intolerably slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this want of coordination facilitated speculation. We shall see
      hereafter how merciless this speculation became and we shall even hear of
      profits on food rising to more than four hundred per cent. However, the
      oft-quoted prices of the later years&mdash;when, for instance, a pair of
      shoes cost a hundred dollars&mdash;signify little, for they rested on an
      inflated currency. None the less they inspired the witticism that one
      should take money to market in a basket and bring provisions home in one's
      pocketbook. Endless stories could be told of speculators hoarding food and
      watching unmoved the sufferings of a famished people. Said Bishop Pierce,
      in a sermon before the General Assembly of Georgia, on Fast Day, in March,
      1863: "Restlessness and discontent prevail.... Extortion, pitiless
      extortion is making havoc in the land. We are devouring each other.
      Avarice with full barns puts the bounties of Providence under bolts and
      bars, waiting with eager longings for higher prices.... The greed of
      gain... stalks among us unabashed by the heroic sacrifice of our women or
      the gallant deeds of our soldiers. Speculation in salt and bread and meat
      runs riot in defiance of the thunders of the pulpit, and executive
      interference and the horrors of threatened famine." In 1864, the
      Government found that quantities of grain paid in under the tax as
      new-grown were mildewed. It was grain of the previous year which
      speculators had held too long and now palmed off on the Government to
      supply the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid these desperate conditions the fate of soldiers' families became
      everywhere, a tragedy. Unless the soldier was a land-owner his family was
      all but helpless. With a depreciated currency and exaggerated prices, his
      pay, whatever his rank, was too little to count in providing for his
      dependents. Local charity, dealt out by state and county boards, by relief
      associations, and by the generosity of neighbors, formed the barrier
      between his family and starvation. The landless soldier, with a family at
      home in desperate straits, is too often overlooked when unimaginative
      people heap up the statistics of "desertion" in the latter half of the
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this period, too, that amid the terrible shrinkage of the
      defensive lines "refugeeing" became a feature of Southern life. From the
      districts over which the waves of war rolled back and forth helpless
      families&mdash;women, children, slaves&mdash;found precarious safety
      together with great hardship by withdrawing to remote places which
      invasion was little likely to reach. An Odyssey of hard travel, often by
      night and half secret, is part of the war tradition of thousands of
      Southern families. And here, as always, the heroic women, smiling,
      indomitable, are the center of the picture. Their flight to preserve the
      children was no small test of courage. Almost invariably they had to
      traverse desolate country, with few attendants, through forests, and
      across rivers, where the arm of the law was now powerless to protect them.
      Outlaws, defiant of the authorities both civil and military,&mdash;ruthless
      men of whom we shall hear again,&mdash;roved those great unoccupied spaces
      so characteristic of the Southern countryside. Many a family legend
      preserves still the sense of breathless caution, of pilgrimage in the
      night-time intently silent for fear of these masterless men. When the
      remote rendezvous had been reached, there a colony of refugees drew
      together in a steadfast despair, unprotected by their own fighting men.
      What strange sad pages in the history of American valor were filled by
      these women outwardly calm, their children romping after butterflies in a
      glory of sunshine, while horrid tales drifted in of deeds done by the
      masterless men in the forest just beyond the horizon, and far off on the
      soul's horizon fathers, husbands, brothers, held grimly the lines of last
      defense!

      Chapter VII. The Turning Of The Tide
    </h2>
    <p>
      The buoyancy of the Southern temper withstood the shock of Gettysburg and
      was not overcome by the fall of Vicksburg. Of the far-reaching
      significance of the latter catastrophe in particular there was little
      immediate recognition. Even Seddon, the Secretary of War, in November,
      reported that "the communication with the Trans-Mississippi, while
      rendered somewhat precarious and insecure, is found by no means cut off or
      even seriously endangered." His report was the same sort of thing as those
      announcements of "strategic retreats" with which the world has since
      become familiar. He even went so far as to argue that on the whole the
      South had gained rather than lost; that the control of the river was of no
      real value to the North; that the loss of Vicksburg "has on our side
      liberated for general operations in the field a large army, while it
      requires the enemy to maintain cooped up, inactive, in positions
      insalubrious to their soldiers, considerable detachments of their forces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seddon attempted to reverse the facts, to show that the importance of the
      Mississippi in commerce was a Northern not a Southern concern. He threw
      light upon the tactics of the time by his description of the future action
      of Confederate sharpshooters who were to terrorize such commercial crews
      as might attempt to navigate the river; he also told how light batteries
      might move swiftly along the banks and, at points commanding the channel,
      rain on the passing steamer unheralded destruction. He was silent upon the
      really serious matter, the patrol of the river by Federal gunboats which
      rendered commerce with the Trans-Mississippi all but impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      This report, dated the 26th of November, gives a roseate view of the war
      in Tennessee and enlarges upon that dreadful battle of Chickamauga which
      "ranks as one of the grandest victories of the war." But even as the
      report was signed, Bragg was in full retreat after his great disaster at
      Chattanooga. On the 30th of November the Administration at Richmond
      received from him a dispatch that closed with these words: "I deem it due
      to the cause and to myself to ask for relief from command and an
      investigation into the causes of the defeat." In the middle of December,
      Joseph E. Johnston was appointed to succeed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever had been the illusions of the Government, they were now at an
      end. There was no denying that the war had entered a new stage and that
      the odds were grimly against the South. Davis recognized the gravity of
      the situation, and in his message to Congress in December, 1863, he
      admitted that the Trans-Mississippi was practically isolated. This was
      indeed a great catastrophe, for hereafter neither men nor supplies could
      be drawn from the far Southwest. Furthermore, the Confederacy had now lost
      its former precious advantage of using Mexico as a means of secret trade
      with Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      These distressing events of the four months between Vicksburg and
      Chattanooga established also the semi-isolation of the middle region of
      the lower South. The two States of Mississippi and Alabama entered upon
      the most desperate chapter of their history. Neither in nor out of the
      Confederacy, neither protected by the Confederate lines nor policed by the
      enemy, they were subject at once to the full rigor of the financial and
      military demands of the Administration of Richmond and to the full
      ruthlessness of plundering raids from the North. Nowhere can the contrast
      between the warfare of that day and the best methods of our own time be
      observed more clearly than in this unhappy region. At the opening of 1864
      the effective Confederate lines drew an irregular zigzag across the map
      from a point in northern Georgia not far below Chattanooga to Mobile.
      Though small Confederate commands still operated bravely west of this
      line, the whole of Mississippi and a large part of Alabama were beyond aid
      from Richmond. But the average man did not grasp the situation. When a
      region is dominated by mobile armies the appearance of things to the
      civilian is deceptive. Because the powerful Federal armies of the
      Southwest, at the opening of 1864, were massed at strategic points from
      Tennessee to the Gulf, and were not extended along an obvious trench line,
      every brave civilian would still keep up his hope and would still insist
      that the middle Gulf country was far from subjugation, that its defense
      against the invader had not become hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under such conditions, when the Government at Richmond called upon the men
      of the Southwest to regard themselves as mere sources of supply, human and
      otherwise, mere feeders to a theater of war that did not include their
      homes, it was altogether natural that they should resent the demand. All
      the tragic confusion that was destined in the course of the fateful year
      1864 to paralyze the Government at Richmond was already apparent in the
      middle Gulf country when the year began. Chief among these was the
      inability of the State and Confederate Governments to cooperate adequately
      in the business of conscription. The two powers were determined rivals
      struggling each to seize the major part of the manhood of the community.
      While Richmond, looking on the situation with the eye of pure strategy,
      wished to draw together the full man-power of the South in one great unit,
      the local authorities were bent on retaining a large part of it for home
      defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Alabama newspapers of the latter half of 1863 strange incidents are
      to be found throwing light on the administrative duel. The writ of habeas
      corpus, as was so often the case in Confederate history, was the bone of
      contention. We have seen that the second statute empowering the President
      to proclaim martial law and to suspend the operation of the writ had
      expired by limitation in February, 1863. The Alabama courts were
      theoretically in full operation, but while the law was in force the
      military authorities had acquired a habit of arbitrary control. Though
      warned from Richmond in general orders that they must not take unto
      themselves a power vested in the President alone, they continued their
      previous course of action. It thereupon became necessary to issue further
      general orders annulling "all proclamations of martial law by general
      officers and others" not invested by law with adequate authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither general orders nor the expiration of the statute, however, seemed
      able to put an end to the interference with the local courts on the part
      of local commanders. The evil apparently grew during 1863. A picturesque
      instance is recorded with extreme fullness by the Southern Advertiser in
      the autumn of the year. In the minutely circumstantial account, we catch
      glimpses of one Rhodes moving heaven and earth to prove himself exempt
      from military service. After Rhodes is enrolled by the officers of the
      local military rendezvous, the sheriff attempts to turn the tables by
      arresting the Colonel in command. The soldiers rush to defend their
      Colonel, who is ill in bed at a house some distance away. The judge who
      had issued the writ is hot with anger at this military interference in
      civil affairs. Thereupon the soldiers seize him, but later, recognizing
      for some unexplained reason the majesty of the civil law, they release
      him. And the hot-tempered incident closes with the Colonel's determination
      to carry the case to the Supreme Court of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      The much harassed people of Alabama had still other causes of complaint
      during this same year. Again the newspapers illumine the situation. In the
      troubled autumn, Joseph Wheeler swept across the northern counties of
      Alabama and in a daring ride, with Federal cavalry hot on his trail,
      reached safety beyond the Tennessee River. Here his pursuers turned back
      and, as their horses had been broken by the swiftness of the pursuit,
      returning slowly, they "gleaned the country" to replace their supplies.
      Incidentally they pounced upon the town of Huntsville. "Their appearance
      here," writes a local correspondent, "was so sudden and... the
      contradictory reports of their whereabouts" had been so baffling that the
      townspeople had found no time to secrete things. The whole neighborhood
      was swept clean of cattle and almost clean of provision. "We have not
      enough left," the report continues, "to haul and plow with... and milch
      cows are non est." Including "Stanley's big raid in July," this was the
      twenty-first raid which Huntsville had endured that year. The report
      closes with a bitter denunciation of the people of southern Alabama who as
      yet do not know what war means, who are accused of complete hardness of
      heart towards their suffering fellow-countrymen and of caring only to make
      money out of war prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Davis sent his message to the Southern Congress at the opening of the
      session of 1864, the desperate plight of the middle Gulf country was at
      once a warning and a menace to the Government. If the conditions of that
      debatable land should extend eastward, there could be little doubt that
      the day of the Confederacy was nearing its close. To remedy the situation
      west of the main Confederate line, to prevent the growth of a similar
      condition east of it, Davis urged Congress to revive the statute
      permitting martial law and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
      The President told Congress that in parts of the Confederacy "public
      meetings have been held, in some of which a treasonable design is masked
      by a pretense of devotion of state sovereignty, and in others is openly
      avowed... a strong suspicion is entertained that secret leagues and
      associations are being formed. In certain localities men of no mean
      position do not hesitate to avow their disloyalty and hostility to our
      cause, and their advocacy of peace on the terms of submission and the
      abolition of slavery."
    </p>
    <p>
      This suspicion on the part of the Confederate Government that it was being
      opposed by organized secret societies takes us back to debatable land and
      to the previous year. The Bureau of Conscription submitted to the
      Secretary of War a report from its Alabama branch relative to "a sworn
      secret organization known to exist and believed to have for its object the
      encouragement of desertion, the protection of deserters from arrest,
      resistance to conscription, and perhaps other designs of a still more
      dangerous character." To the operations of this insidious foe were
      attributed the shifting of the vote in the Alabama elections, the defeat
      of certain candidates favored by the Government, and the return in their
      stead of new men "not publicly known." The suspicions of the Government
      were destined to further verification in the course of 1864 by the
      unearthing of a treasonable secret society in southwestern Virginia, the
      members of which were "bound to each other for the prosecution of their
      nefarious designs by the most solemn oaths. They were under obligation to
      encourage desertions from the army, and to pass and harbor all deserters,
      escaped prisoners, or spies; to give information to the enemy of the
      movements of our troops, of exposed or weakened positions, of inviting
      opportunities of attack, and to guide and assist the enemy either in
      advance or retreat." This society bore the grandiloquent name "Heroes of
      America" and had extended its operations into Tennessee and North
      Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the year further evidence was collected which satisfied
      the secret service of the existence of a mysterious and nameless society
      which had ramifications throughout Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia. A
      detective who joined this "Peace Society," as it was called, for the
      purpose of betraying its secrets, had marvelous tales to tell of
      confidential information given to him by members, of how Missionary Ridge
      had been lost and Vicksburg had surrendered through the machinations of
      this society. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * What classes were represented in these organizations it is
     difficult if not impossible to determine. They seem to have
     been involved in the singular "peace movement" which is yet
     to be considered. This fact gives a possible clue to the
     problem of their membership. A suspiciously large number of
     the "peace" men were original anti-secessionists, and though
     many, perhaps most, of these who opposed secession became
     loyal servants of the Confederacy, historians may have
     jumped too quickly to the assumption that the sincerity of
     all of these men was above reproach.
</pre>
    <p>
      In spite of its repugnance to the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus,
      Congress was so impressed by the gravity of the situation that early in
      1864 it passed another act "to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas
      corpus in certain cases." This was not quite the same as that sweeping act
      of 1862 which had set the Mercury irrevocably in opposition. Though this
      act of 1864 gave the President the power to order the arrest of any person
      suspected of treasonable practices, and though it released military
      officers from all obligation to obey the order of any civil court to
      surrender a prisoner charged with treason, the new legislation carefully
      defined a list of cases in which alone this power could be lawfully used.
      This was the last act of the sort passed by the Confederate Congress, and
      when it expired by limitation ninety days after the next meeting of
      Congress it was not renewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the administration of the army, Congress can hardly be said
      to have met the President more than half way. The age of military service
      was lowered to seventeen and was raised to fifty. But the President was
      not given&mdash;though he had asked for it&mdash;general control over
      exemptions. Certain groups, such as ministers, editors, physicians, were
      in the main exempted; one overseer was exempted on each plantation where
      there were fifteen slaves, provided he gave bond to sell to the Government
      at official prices each year one hundred pounds of either beef or bacon
      for each slave employed and provided he would sell all his surplus produce
      either to the Government or to the families of soldiers. Certain civil
      servants of the Confederacy were also exempted as well as those whom the
      governors of States should "certify to be necessary for the proper
      administration of the State Government." The President was authorized to
      detail for nonmilitary service any members of the Confederate forces "when
      in his judgment, justice, equity, and necessity, require such details."
    </p>
    <p>
      This statute retained two features that had already given rise to much
      friction, and that were destined to be the cause of much more. It was
      still within the power of state governors to impede conscription very
      seriously. By certifying that a man was necessary to the civil
      administration of a State, a Governor could place him beyond the legal
      reach of the conscripting officers. This provision was a concession to
      those who looked on Davis's request for authority over exemption as the
      first step toward absolutism. On the other hand the statute allowed the
      President a free hand in the scarcely less important matter of "details."
      Among the imperative problems of the Confederacy, where the whole male
      population was needed in the public service, was the most economical
      separation of the two groups, the fighters and the producers. On the one
      hand there was the constant demand for recruits to fill up the wasted
      armies; on the other, the need for workers to keep the shops going and to
      secure the harvest. The two interests were never fully coordinated. Under
      the act of 1864, no farmer, mechanic, tradesman, between the ages of
      seventeen and fifty, if fit for military service, could remain at his work
      except as a "detail" under orders of the President: he might be called to
      the colors at a moment's notice. We shall see, presently, how the revoking
      of details, toward the end of what may truly be called the terrible year,
      was one of the major incidents of Confederate history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together with the new conscription act, the President approved on February
      17, 1864, a reenactment of the tax in kind, with some slight concessions
      to the convenience of the farmers. The President's appeal for a law
      directly taxing slaves and land had been ignored by Congress, but another
      of his suggestions had been incorporated in the Funding Act. The state of
      the currency was now so grave that Davis attributed to it all the evils
      growing out of the attempts to enforce impressment. As the value of the
      paper dollar had by this time shrunk to six cents in specie and the volume
      of Confederate paper was upward of seven hundred millions, Congress
      undertook to reduce the volume and raise the value by compelling holders
      of notes to exchange them for bonds. By way of driving the note-holders to
      consent to the exchange, provision was made for the speedy taxation of
      notes for one-third their face value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the main items of the government program for 1864. Armed with
      this, Davis braced himself for the great task of making head against the
      enemies that now surrounded the Confederacy. It is an axiom of military
      science that when one combatant possesses the interior line, the other can
      offset this advantage only by exerting coincident pressure all round, thus
      preventing him from shifting his forces from one front to another. On this
      principle, the Northern strategists had at last completed their gigantic
      plan for a general envelopment of the whole Confederate defense both by
      land and sea. Grant opened operations by crossing the Rapidan and
      telegraphing Sherman to advance into Georgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stern events of the spring of 1864 form such a famous page in military
      history that the sober civil story of those months appears by comparison
      lame and impotent. Nevertheless, the Confederate Government during those
      months was at least equal to its chief obligation: it supplied and
      recruited the armies. With Grant checked at Cold Harbor, in June, and
      Sherman still unable to pierce the western line, the hopes of the
      Confederates were high.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the North there was corresponding gloom. This was the moment when all
      Northern opponents of the war drew together in their last attempt to
      shatter the Lincoln Government and make peace with the Confederacy. The
      value to the Southern cause of this Northern movement for peace at any
      price was keenly appreciated at Richmond. Trusted agents of the
      Confederacy were even then in Canada working deftly to influence Northern
      sentiment. The negotiations with those Northern secret societies which
      befriended the South belong properly in the story of Northern politics and
      the presidential election of 1864. They were skillfully conducted chiefly
      by Jacob Thompson and C. C. Clay. The reports of these agents throughout
      the spring and summer were all hopeful and told of "many intelligent men
      from the United States" who sought them out in Canada for political
      consultations. They discussed "our true friends from the Chicago
      (Democratic) convention" and even gave names of those who, they were
      assured, would have seats in McClellan's Cabinet. They were really not
      well informed upon Northern affairs, and even after the tide had turned
      against the Democrats in September, they were still priding themselves on
      their diplomatic achievement, still confident they had helped organize a
      great political power, had "given a stronger impetus to the peace party of
      the North than all other causes combined, and had greatly reduced the
      strength of the war party."
    </p>
    <p>
      While Clay and Thompson built their house of cards in Canada, the Richmond
      Government bent anxious eyes on the western battlefront. Sherman, though
      repulsed in his one frontal attack at Kenesaw Mountain, had steadily
      worked his way by the left flank of the Confederate army, until in early
      July he was within six miles of Atlanta. All the lower South was a-tremble
      with apprehension. Deputations were sent to Richmond imploring the removal
      of Johnston from the western command. What had he done since his
      appointment in December but retreat? Such was the tenor of public opinion.
      "It is all very well to talk of Fabian policy," said one of his detractors
      long afterward, "and now we can see we were rash to say the least. But at
      the time, all of us went wrong together. Everybody clamored for Johnston's
      removal." Johnston and Davis were not friends; but the President hesitated
      long before acting. And yet, with each day, political as well as military
      necessity grew more imperative. Both at Washington and Richmond the effect
      that the fighting in Georgia had on Northern opinion was seen to be of the
      first importance. Sherman was staking everything to break the Confederate
      line and take Atlanta. He knew that a great victory would have
      incalculable effect on the Northern election. Davis knew equally well that
      the defeat of Sherman would greatly encourage the peace party in the
      North. But he had no general of undoubted genius whom he could put in
      Johnston's place. However, the necessity for a bold stroke was so
      undeniable, and Johnston appeared so resolute to continue his Fabian
      policy, that Davis reluctantly took a desperate chance and superseded him
      by Hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      During August, though the Democratic convention at Chicago drew up its
      platform favoring peace at any price, the anxiety of the Southern
      President did not abate his activities. The safety of the western line was
      now his absorbing concern. And in mid-August that line was turned, in a
      way, by Farragut's capture of Mobile Bay. As the month closed, Sherman,
      despite the furious blows delivered by Hood, was plainly getting the upper
      hand. North and South, men watched that tremendous duel with the feeling
      that the foundations of things were rocking. At last, on the 2d of
      September, Sherman, victorious, entered Atlanta.

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII. A Game Of Chance
    </h2>
    <p>
      With dramatic completeness in the summer and autumn of 1864, the
      foundations of the Confederate hope one after another gave way. Among the
      causes of this catastrophe was the failure of the second great attempt on
      the part of the Confederacy to secure recognition abroad. The subject
      takes us back to the latter days of 1862, when the center of gravity in
      foreign affairs had shifted from London to Paris. Napoleon III, at the
      height of his strange career, playing half a dozen dubious games at once,
      took up a new pastime and played at intrigue with the Confederacy. In
      October he accorded a most gracious interview to Slidell. He remarked that
      his sympathies were entirely with the South but added that, if he acted
      alone, England might trip him up. He spoke of his scheme for joint
      intervention by England, France, and Russia. Then he asked why we had not
      created a navy. Slidell snapped at the bait. He said that the Confederates
      would be glad to build ships in France, that "if the Emperor would give
      only some kind of verbal assurance that the police would not observe too
      closely when we wished to put on guns and men we would gladly avail
      ourselves of it." To this, the imperial trickster replied, "Why could you
      not have them built as for the Italian Government? I do not think it would
      be difficult but will consult the Minister of Marine about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slidell left the Emperor's presence confident that things would happen.
      And they did. First came Napoleon's proposal of intervention, which was
      declined before the end of the year by England and Russia. Then came his
      futile overtures to the Government at Washington, his offer of mediation&mdash;which
      was rejected early in 1863. But Slidell remained confident that something
      else would happen. And in this expectation also he was not disappointed.
      The Emperor was deeply involved in Mexico and was busily intriguing
      throughout Europe. This was the time when Erlanger, standing high in the
      favor of the Emperor, made his gambler's proposal to the Confederate
      authorities about cotton. Another of the Emperor's friends now enters the
      play. On January 7, 1863, M. Arman, of Bordeaux, "the largest shipbuilder
      in France," had called on the Confederate commissioner: M. Arman would be
      happy to build ironclad ships for the Confederacy, and as to paying for
      them, cotton bonds might do the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder Slidell was elated, so much so that he seems to have given
      little heed to the Emperor's sinister intimation that the whole affair
      must be subterranean. But the wily Bonaparte had not forgotten that six
      months earlier he had issued a decree of neutrality forbidding Frenchmen
      to take commissions from either belligerent "for the armament of vessels
      of war or to accept letters of marque, or to cooperate in any way
      whatsoever in the equipment or arming of any vessel of war or corsair of
      either belligerent." He did not intend to abandon publicly this cautious
      attitude&mdash;at least, not for the present. And while Slidell at Paris
      was completely taken in, the cooler head of A. Dudley Mann, Confederate
      commissioner at Brussels, saw what an international quicksand was the
      favor of Napoleon. It was about this time that Napoleon, having dispatched
      General Forey with a fresh army to Mexico, wrote the famous letter which
      gave notice to the world of what he was about. Mann wrote home in alarm
      that the Emperor might be expected to attempt recovering Mexico's ancient
      areas including Texas. Slidell saw in the Forey letter only "views...
      which will not be gratifying to the Washington Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      The adroit Arman, acting on hints from high officers of the Government,
      applied for permission to build and arm ships of war, alleging that he
      intended to send them to the Pacific and sell them to either China or
      Japan. To such a laudable expression of commercial enterprise, one of his
      fellows in the imperial ring, equipped with proper authority under
      Bonaparte, hastened to give official approbation, and Erlanger came
      forward by way of financial backer. There were conferences of Confederate
      agents; contracts were signed; plans were agreed upon; and the work was
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no more hopeful man in the Confederate service than Slidell
      when, in the full flush of pride after Chancellorsville, he appealed to
      the Emperor to cease waiting on other powers and recognize the
      Confederacy. Napoleon accorded another gracious interview but still
      insisted that it was impossible for him to act alone. He said that he was
      "more fully convinced than ever of the propriety of a general recognition
      by the European powers of the Confederate States but that the commerce of
      France and the interests of the Mexican expedition would be jeopardized by
      a rupture with the United States" and unless England would stand by him he
      dared not risk such an eventuality. In point of fact, he was like a
      speculator who is "hedging" on the stock exchange, both buying and
      selling, and trying to make up his mind on which cast to stake his
      fortune. At the same time he threw out once more the sinister caution
      about the ships. He said that the ships might be built in France but that
      their destination must be concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Napoleon's choice just then, if England had supported him, would have
      been recognition of the Confederacy, cannot be doubted. The tangle of
      intrigue which he called his foreign policy was not encouraging. He was
      deeply involved in Italian politics, where the daring of Garibaldi had
      reopened the struggle between clericals and liberals. In France itself the
      struggle between parties was keen. Here, as in the American imbroglio, he
      found it hard to decide with which party to break. The chimerical scheme
      of a Latin empire in Mexico was his spectacular device to catch the
      imagination, and incidentally the pocketbook, of everybody. But in order
      to carry out this enterprise he must be able to avert or withstand the
      certain hostility of the United States. Therefore, as he told Slidell, "no
      other power than England possessed a sufficient navy" to pull his
      chestnuts out of the fire. The moment was auspicious, for there was a
      revival of the "Southern party" in England. The sailing of the Alabama
      from Liverpool during the previous summer had encouraged the Confederate
      agents and their British friends to undertake further shipbuilding.
    </p>
    <p>
      While M. Arman was at work in France, the Laird Brothers were at work in
      England and their dockyards contained two ironclad rams supposed to
      outclass any vessels of the United States navy. Though every effort had
      been made to keep secret the ultimate destination of these rams, the
      vigilance of the United States minister, reinforced by the zeal of the
      "Northern party," detected strong circumstantial evidence pointing toward
      a Confederate contract with the Lairds. A popular agitation ensued along
      with demands upon the Government to investigate. To mask the purposes of
      the Lairds, Captain James Bullock, the able special agent of the
      Confederate navy, was forced to fall lack upon the same tactics that were
      being used across the Channel, and to sell the rams, on paper, to a firm
      in France. Neither he nor Slidell yet appreciated what a doubtful refuge
      was the shadow of Napoleon's wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the British Government, by this time practically alined with
      the North, continued its search for the real owner of the Laird rams. The
      "Southern party," however, had not quite given up hope, and the agitation
      to prevent the sailing of the rams was a keen spur to its flagging zeal.
      Furthermore the prestige of Lee never was higher than it was in June,
      1863, when the news of Chancellorsville was still fresh and resounding in
      every mind. It had given new life to the Confederate hope: Lee would take
      Washington before the end of the summer; the Laird rams would go to sea;
      the Union would be driven to the wall. So reasoned the ardent friends of
      the South. But one thing was lacking&mdash;a European alliance. What a
      time for England to intervene!
    </p>
    <p>
      While Slidell was talking with the Emperor, he had in his pocket a letter
      from J. A. Roebuck, an English politician who wished to force the issue in
      the House of Commons. As a preliminary to moving the recognition of the
      Confederacy, he wanted authority to deny a rumor going the rounds in
      London, to the effect that Napoleon had taken position against
      intervention. Napoleon, when he had seen the letter, began a negotiation
      of some sort with this politician. It is needless to enter into the
      complications that ensued, the subsequent recriminations, and the question
      as to just what Napoleon promised at this time and how many of his
      promises he broke. He was a diplomat of the old school, the school of
      lying as a fine art. He permitted Roebuck to come over to Paris for an
      audience, and Roebuck went away with the impression that Napoleon could be
      relied upon to back up a new movement for recognition. When, however,
      Roebuck brought the matter before the Commons at the end of the month and
      encountered an opposition from the Government that seemed to imply an
      understanding with Napoleon which was different from his own, he withdrew
      his motion (in July). Once more the scale turned against the Confederacy,
      and Gettysburg was supplemented by the seizure of the Laird rams by the
      British authorities. These events explain the bitter turn given to
      Confederate feeling toward England in the latter part of 1863. On the 4th
      of August Benjamin wrote to Mason that "the perusal of the recent debates
      in 'Parliament satisfies the President" that Mason's "continued residence
      in London is neither conducive to the interests nor consistent with the
      dignity of this government," and directed him to withdraw to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confederate feeling, as it cooled toward England, warmed toward France.
      Napoleon's Mexican scheme, including the offer of a ready-made imperial
      crown to Maximilian, the brother of the Emperor of Austria, was fully
      understood at Richmond; and with Napoleon's need of an American ally,
      Southern hope revived. It was further strengthened by a pamphlet which was
      translated and distributed in the South as a newspaper article under the
      title France, Mexico, and the Confederate States. The reputed author,
      Michel Chevalier, was an imperial senator, another member of the Napoleon
      ring, and highly trusted by his shifty master. The pamphlet, which
      emphasized the importance of Southern independence as a condition of
      Napoleon's "beneficent aims" in Mexico, was held to have been inspired,
      and the imperial denial was regarded as a mere matter of form.
    </p>
    <p>
      What appeared to be significant of the temper of the Imperial Government
      was a decree of a French court in the case of certain merchants who sought
      to recover insurance on wine dispatched to America and destroyed in a ship
      taken by the Alabama. Their plea was that they were insured against loss
      by "pirates." The court dismissed their suit and assessed costs against
      them. Further evidence of Napoleon's favor was the permission given to the
      Confederate cruiser Florida to repair at Brest and even to make use of the
      imperial dockyard. The very general faith in Napoleon's promises was
      expressed by Davis in his message to Congress in December: "Although
      preferring our own government and institutions to those of other
      countries, we can have no disposition to contest the exercise by them of
      the same right of self-government which we assert for ourselves. If the
      Mexican people prefer a monarchy to a republic, it is our plain duty
      cheerfully to acquiesce in their decision and to evince a sincere and
      friendly interest in their prosperity.... The Emperor of the French has
      solemnly disclaimed any purpose to impose on Mexico a form of government
      not acceptable to the nation...." In January, 1864, hope of recognition
      through support of Napoleon's Mexican policy moved the Confederate
      Congress to adopt resolutions providing for a Minister to the Mexican
      Empire and giving him instructions with regard to a presumptive treaty. To
      the new post Davis appointed General William Preston.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what, while hope was springing high in America, was taking place in
      France? So far as the world could say, there was little if anything to
      disturb the Confederates; and yet, on the horizon, a cloud the size of a
      man's hand had appeared. M. Arman had turned to another member of the
      Legislative Assembly, a sound Bonapartist like himself, M. Voruz, of
      Nantes, to whom he had sublet a part of the Confederate contract. The
      truth about the ships and their destination thus became part of the
      archives of the Voruz firm. No phase of Napoleonic intrigue could go very
      far without encountering dishonesty, and to the confidential clerk of M.
      Voruz there occurred the bright idea of doing something for himself with
      this valuable diplomatic information. One fine day the clerk was missing
      and with him certain papers. Then there ensued a period of months during
      which the firm and their employers could only conjecture the full extent
      of their loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, from the Confederate point of view, everything was lost. Again
      the episode becomes too complex to be followed in detail. Suffice it to
      say that the papers were sold to the United States; that the secret was
      exposed; that the United States made a determined assault upon the
      Imperial Government. In the midst of this entanglement, Slidell lost his
      head, for hope deferred when apparently within reach of its end is a
      dangerous councilor of state. In his extreme anxiety, Slidell sent to the
      Emperor a note the blunt rashness of which the writer could not have
      appreciated. Saying that he feared the Emperor's subordinates might play
      into the hands of Washington, he threw his fat in the fire by speaking of
      the ships as "now being constructed at Bordeaux and Nantes for the
      government of the Confederate States" and virtually claimed of Napoleon a
      promise to let them go to sea. Three days later the Minister of Foreign
      Affairs took him sharply to task because of this note, reminding him that
      "what had passed with the Emperor was confidential" and dropping the
      significant hint that France could not be forced into war by
      "indirection." According to Slidell's version of the interview "the
      Minister's tone changed completely" when Slidell replied with "a detailed
      history of the affair showing that the idea originated with the Emperor."
      Perhaps the Minister knew more than he chose to betray. From this hour the
      game was up. Napoleon's purpose all along seems to have been quite plain.
      He meant to help the South to win by itself, and, after it had won, to use
      it for his own advantage. So precarious was his position in Europe that he
      dared not risk an American war without England's aid, and England had cast
      the die. In this way, secrecy was the condition necessary to continued
      building of the ships. Now that the secret was out, Napoleon began to
      shift his ground. He sounded the Washington Government and found it
      suspiciously equivocal as to Mexico. To silence the French republicans, to
      whom the American minister had supplied information about the ships,
      Napoleon tried at first muzzling the press. But as late as February, 1864,
      he was still carrying water on both shoulders. His Minister of Marine
      notified the builders that they must get the ships out of France, unarmed,
      under fictitious sale to some neutral country. The next month, reports
      which the Confederate commissioners sent home became distinctly alarming.
      Mann wrote from Brussels: "Napoleon has enjoined upon Maximilian to hold
      no official relations with our commissioners in Mexico." Shortly after
      this Slidell received a shock that was the beginning of the end:
      Maximilian, on passing through Paris on his way to Mexico, refused to
      receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mexican project was now being condemned by all classes in France.
      Nevertheless, the Government was trying to float a Mexican loan, and it is
      hardly fanciful to think that on this loan the last hope of the
      Confederacy turned. Despite the popular attitude toward Mexico, the loan
      was going well when the House of Representatives of the United States
      dealt the Confederacy a staggering blow. It passed unanimous resolutions
      in the most grim terms, denouncing the substitution of monarchical for
      republican government in Mexico under European auspices. When this action
      was reported in France, the Mexican loan collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon's Italian policy was now moving rapidly toward the crisis which
      it reached during the following summer when he surrendered to the
      opposition and promised to withdraw the French troops from Rome. In May,
      when the loan collapsed, there was nothing for it but to throw over his
      dear friends of the Confederacy. Presently he had summoned Arman before
      him, "rated him severely," and ordered him to make bona fide sales of the
      ships to neutral powers. The Minister of Marine professed surprise and
      indignation at Arman's trifling with the neutrality of the Imperial
      Government. And that practically was the end of the episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally complete was the breakdown of the Confederate negotiations with
      Mexico. General Preston was refused recognition. In those fierce days of
      July when the fate of Atlanta was in the balance, the pride and despair of
      the Confederate Government flared up in a haughty letter to Preston
      reminding him that "it had never been the intention of this Government to
      offer any arguments to the new Government of Mexico... nor to place itself
      in any attitude other than that of complete equality," and directing him
      to make no further overtures to the Mexican Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the debacle in Georgia. On that same 20th of September when
      Benjamin poured out in a letter to Slidell his stored-up bitterness
      denouncing Napoleon, Davis, feeling the last crisis was upon him, left
      Richmond to join the army in Georgia. His frame of mind he had already
      expressed when he said, "We have no friends abroad."

      Chapter IX. Desperate Remedies
    </h2>
    <p>
      The loss of Atlanta was the signal for another conflict of authority
      within the Confederacy. Georgia was now in the condition in which Alabama
      had found herself in the previous year. A great mobile army of invaders
      lay encamped on her soil. And yet there was still a state Government
      established at the capital. Inevitably the man who thought of the
      situation from the point of view of what we should now call the general
      staff, and the man who thought of it from the point of view of a citizen
      of the invaded State, suffered each an intensification of feeling, and
      each became determined to solve the problem in his own way. The President
      of the Confederacy and the Governor of Georgia represented these
      incompatible points of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor, Joseph E. Brown, is one of the puzzling figures of
      Confederate history. We have already encountered him as a dogged opponent
      of the Administration. With the whole fabric of Southern life toppling
      about his ears, Brown argued, quibbled, evaded, and became a
      rallying-point of disaffection. That more eminent Georgian, Howell Cobb,
      applied to him very severe language, and they became engaged in a
      controversy over that provision of the Conscription Act which exempted
      state officials from military service. While the Governor of Virginia was
      refusing certificates of exemption to the minor civil officers such as
      justices of the peace, Brown by proclamation promised his "protection" to
      the most insignificant civil servants. "Will even your Excellency,"
      demanded Cobb, "certify that in any county of Georgia twenty justices of
      the peace and an equal number of constables are necessary for the proper
      administration of the state government?" The Bureau of Conscription
      estimated that Brown kept out of the army approximately 8000 eligible men.
      The truth seems to be that neither by education nor heredity was this
      Governor equipped to conceive large ideas. He never seemed conscious of
      the war as a whole, or of the Confederacy as a whole. To defend Georgia
      and, if that could not be done, to make peace for Georgia&mdash;such in
      the mind of Brown was the aim of the war. His restless jealousy of the
      Administration finds its explanation in his fear that it would denude his
      State of men. The seriousness of Governor Brown's opposition became
      apparent within a week of the fall of Atlanta. Among Hood's forces were
      some 10,000 Georgia militia. Brown notified Hood that these troops had
      been called out solely with a view to the defense of Atlanta, that since
      Atlanta had been lost they must now be permitted "to return to their homes
      and look for a time after important interests," and that therefore he did
      "withdraw said organizations" from Hood's command. In other words, Brown
      was afraid that they might be taken out of the State. By proclamation he
      therefore gave the militia a furlough of thirty days. Previous to the
      issue of this proclamation, Seddon had written to Brown making requisition
      for his 10,000 militia to assist in a pending campaign against Sherman.
      Two days after his proclamation had appeared, Brown, in a voluminous
      letter full of blustering rhetoric and abounding in sneers at the
      President, demanded immediate reinforcements by order of the President and
      threatened that, if they were not sent, he would recall the Georgia troops
      from the army of Lee and would command "all the sons of Georgia to return
      to their own State and within their own limits to rally round her glorious
      flag."
    </p>
    <p>
      So threatening was the situation in Georgia that Davis attempted to take
      it into his own hands. In a grim frame of mind he left Richmond for the
      front. The resulting military arrangements do not of course belong
      strictly to the subject matter of this volume; but the brief tour of
      speechmaking which Davis made in Georgia and the interior of South
      Carolina must be noticed; for his purpose seems to have been to put the
      military point of view squarely before the people. He meant them to see
      how the soldier looked at the situation, ignoring all demands of locality,
      of affiliation, of hardship, and considering only how to meet and beat the
      enemy. In his tense mood he was not always fortunate in his expressions.
      At Augusta, for example, he described Beauregard, whom he had recently
      placed in general command over Georgia and South Carolina, as one who
      would do whatever the President told him to do. But this idea of military
      self-effacement was not happily worded, and the enemies of Davis seized on
      his phraseology as further evidence of his instinctive autocracy. The
      Mercury compared him to the Emperor of Russia and declared the tactless
      remark to be "as insulting to General Beauregard as it is false and
      presumptuous in the President."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Beauregard was negotiating with Brown. Though they came to an
      understanding about the disposition of the militia, Brown still tried to
      keep control of the state troops. When Sherman was burning Atlanta
      preparatory to the March to the Sea, Brown addressed to the Secretary of
      War another interminable epistle, denouncing the Confederate authorities
      and asserting his willingness to fight both the South and the North if
      they did not both cease invading his rights. But the people of Georgia
      were better balanced than their Governor. Under the leadership of such men
      as Cobb they rose to the occasion and did their part in what proved a vain
      attempt to conduct a "people's war." Their delegation at Richmond sent out
      a stirring appeal assuring them that Davis was doing for them all it was
      possible to do. "Let every man fly to arms," said the appeal. "Remove your
      negroes, horses, cattle, and provisions from before Sherman's army, and
      burn what you cannot carry. Burn all bridges and block up the roads in his
      route. Assail the invader in front, flank, and rear, by night and by day.
      Let him have no rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Richmond Government was unable to detach any considerable force from
      the northern front. Its contribution to the forces in Georgia was
      accomplished by such pathetic means as a general order calling to the
      colors all soldiers furloughed or in hospital, "except those unable to
      travel"; by revoking all exemptions to farmers, planters, and mechanics,
      except munitions workers; and by placing one-fifth of the ordnance and
      mining bureau in the battle service.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the world knows how futile were these endeavors to stop the whirlwind
      of desolation that was Sherman's march. He spent his Christmas Day in
      Savannah. Then the center of gravity shifted from Georgia to South
      Carolina. Throughout the two desperate months that closed 1864 the
      authorities of South Carolina had vainly sought for help from Richmond.
      Twice the Governor made official request for the return to South Carolina
      of some of her own troops who were at the front in Virginia. Davis first
      evaded and then refused the request. Lee had informed him that if the
      forces on the northern front were reduced, the evacuation of Richmond
      would become inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The South Carolina Government, in December, 1864, seems to have concluded
      that the State must save itself. A State Conscription Act was passed
      placing all white males between the ages of sixteen and sixty at the
      disposal of the state authorities for emergency duty. An Exemption Act set
      forth a long list of persons who should not be liable to conscription by
      the Confederate Government. Still a third act regulated the impressment of
      slaves for work on fortifications so as to enable the state authorities to
      hold a check upon the Confederate authorities. The significance of the
      three statutes was interpreted by a South Carolina soldier, General John
      S. Preston, in a letter to the Secretary of War that was a wail of
      despair. "This legislation is an explicit declaration that this State does
      not intend to contribute another soldier or slave to the public defense,
      except on such terms its may be dictated by her authorities. The example
      will speedily be followed by North Carolina and Georgia, the Executives of
      those States having already assumed the position."
    </p>
    <p>
      The division between the two parties in South Carolina had now become
      bitter. To Preston the men behind the State Exemption Act appeared as
      "designing knaves." The Mercury, on the other hand, was never more
      relentless toward Davis than in the winter of 1864-1865. However, none or
      almost none of the anti-Davis men in South Carolina made the least
      suggestion of giving up the struggle. To fight to the end but also to act
      as a check upon the central Government&mdash;as the new Governor, Andrew
      G. Magrath, said in his inaugural address in December, 1864,&mdash;was the
      aim of the dominant party in South Carolina. How far the State Government
      and the Confederate Government had drifted apart is shown by two comments
      which were made in January, 1865. Lee complained that the South Carolina
      regiments, "much reduced by hard service," were not being recruited up to
      their proper strength because of the measures adopted in the southeastern
      States to retain conscripts at home. About the same date the Mercury
      arraigned Davis for leaving South Carolina defenseless in the face of
      Sherman's coming offensive, and asked whether Davis intended to surrender
      the Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the midst of this critical period, the labor problem pushed to the
      fore again. The revocation of industrial details, necessary as it was, had
      put almost the whole male population&mdash;in theory, at least&mdash;in
      the general Confederate army. How far-reaching was the effect of this
      order may be judged from the experience of the Columbia and Augusta
      Railroad Company. This road was building through the interior of the State
      a new line which was rendered imperatively necessary by Sherman's seizure
      of the lines terminating at Savannah. The effect of the revocation order
      on the work in progress was described by the president of the road in a
      letter to the Secretary of War:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In July and August I made a fair beginning and by October we had about
      600 hands. General Order No. 77 took off many of our contractors and
      hands. We still had increased the number of hands to about 400 when
      Sherman started from Atlanta. The military authorities of Augusta took
      about 300 of them to fortify that city. These contractors being from
      Georgia returned with their slaves to their homes after being discharged
      at Augusta. We still have between 500 and 600 hands at work and are adding
      to the force every week.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The great difficulty has been in getting contractors exempt or definitely
      detailed since Order No. 77. I have not exceeded eight or nine contractors
      now detailed. The rest are exempt from other causes or over age."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was against such a background of economic confusion that Magrath wrote
      to the Governor of North Carolina making a revolutionary proposal.
      Virtually admitting that the Confederacy had been shattered, and knowing
      the disposition of those in authority to see only the military aspects of
      any given situation, he prophesied two things: that the generals would
      soon attempt to withdraw Lee's army south of Virginia, and that the
      Virginia troops in that army would refuse to go. "It is natural under the
      circumstances," said he, "that they would not." He would prepare for this
      emergency by an agreement among the Southeastern and Gulf States to act
      together irrespective of Richmond, and would thus weld the military power
      of these States into "a compact and organized mass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Governor Vance, with unconscious subtlety, etched a portrait of his own
      mind when he replied that the crisis demanded "particularly the skill of
      the politician perhaps more than that of the great general." He adroitly
      evaded saying what he really thought of the situation but he made two
      explicit counter-proposals. He suggested that a demand should be made for
      the restoration of General Johnston and for the appointment of General Lee
      to "full and absolute command of all the forces of the Confederacy." On
      the day on which Vance wrote to Magrath, the Mercury lifted up its voice
      and cried out for a Lee to take charge of the Government and save the
      Confederacy. About the same time Cobb wrote to Davis in the most friendly
      way, warning him that he had scarcely a supporter left in Georgia, and
      that, in view of the great popular reaction in favor of Johnston,
      concessions to the opposition were an imperative necessity. "By accident,"
      said he, "I have become possessed of the facts in connection with the
      proposed action of the Governors of certain States." He disavowed any
      sympathy with the movement but warned Davis that it was a serious menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two other intrigues added to the general political confusion. One of
      these, the "Peace Movement," will be considered in the next chapter. The
      other was closely connected with the alleged conspiracy to depose Davis
      and set up Lee as dictator. If the traditional story, accepted by able
      historians, may be believed, William C. Rives, of the Confederate
      Congress, carried in January, 1865, to Lee from a congressional cabal an
      invitation to accept the role of Cromwell. The greatest difficulty in the
      way of accepting the tradition is the extreme improbability that any one
      who knew anything of Lee would have been so foolish as to make such a
      proposal. Needless to add, the tradition includes Lee's refusal to
      overturn the Government. There can be no doubt, however, that all the
      enemies of Davis in Congress and out of it, in the opening months of 1865,
      made a determined series of attacks upon his Administration. Nor can there
      be any doubt that the popular faith in Lee was used as their trump card.
      To that end, a bill was introduced to create the office of commanding
      general of the Confederate armies. The bill was generally applauded, and
      every one assumed that the new office was to be given to Lee. On the day
      after the bill had passed the Senate the Virginia Legislature resolved
      that the appointment of General Lee to supreme command would "reanimate
      the spirit of the armies as well as the people of the several States
      and... inspire increased confidence in the final success of the cause."
      When the bill was sent to the President, it was accompanied by a
      resolution asking him to restore Johnston. While Davis was considering
      this bill, the Virginia delegation in the House, headed by the Speaker,
      Thomas S. Bocock, waited upon the President, informed him what was really
      wanted was a change of Cabinet, and told him that three-fourths of the
      House would support a resolution of want of confidence in the Cabinet. The
      next day Bocock repeated the demand in a note which Davis described as a
      "warning if not a threat."
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation of both President and country was now desperate. The program
      with which the Government had entered so hopefully upon this fated year
      had broken down at almost every point. In addition to the military and
      administrative disasters, the financial and economic situation was as bad
      as possible. So complete was the financial breakdown that Secretary
      Memminger, utterly disheartened, had resigned his office, and the Treasury
      was now administered by a Charleston merchant, George A. Trenholm. But the
      financial chaos was wholly beyond his control. The government notes
      reckoned in gold were worth about three cents on the dollar. The
      Government itself avoided accepting them. It even bought up United States
      currency and used it in transacting the business of the army. The extent
      of the financial collapse was to be measured by such incidents as the
      following which is recounted in a report that had passed under Davis's eye
      only a few weeks before the "threat" of Bocock was uttered: "Those holding
      the four per cent certificates complain that the Government as far as
      possible discredits them. Fractions of hundreds cannot be paid with them.
      I saw a widow lady, a few days since, offer to pay her taxes of $1,271.31
      with a certificate of $1,300. The tax-gatherer refused to give her the
      change of $28.69. She then offered the whole certificate for the taxes.
      This was refused. This apparent injustice touched her far more than the
      amount of the taxes."
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter addressed to the President from Griffin, Georgia, contained this
      dreary picture:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless something is done and that speedily, there will be thousands of
      the best citizens of the State and heretofore as loyal as any in the
      Confederacy, that will not care one cent which army is victorious in
      Georgia.... Since August last there have been thousands of cavalry and
      wagon trains feeding upon our cornfields and for which our quartermasters
      and officers in command of trains, regiments, battalions, companies, and
      squads, have been giving the farmers receipts, and we were all told these
      receipts would pay our government taxes and tithing; and yet not one of
      them will be taken by our collector.... And yet we are threatened with
      having our lands sold for taxes. Our scrip for corn used by our generals
      will not be taken.... How is it that we have certified claims upon our
      Government, past due ten months, and when we enter the quartermaster's
      office we see placed up conspicuously in large letters "no funds." Some of
      these said quartermasters [who] four years ago were not worth the clothes
      upon their backs, are now large dealers in lands, negroes, and real
      estate."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was almost universal complaint that government contractors were
      speculating in supplies and that the Impressment Law was used by officials
      to cover their robbery of both the Government and the people. Allowing for
      all the panic of the moment, one is forced to conclude that the smoke is
      too dense not to cover a good deal of fire. In a word, at the very time
      when local patriotism everywhere was drifting into opposition to the
      general military command and when Congress was reflecting this widespread
      loss of confidence, the Government was loudly charged with inability to
      restrain graft. In all these accusations there was much injustice.
      Conditions that the Government was powerless to control were cruelly
      exaggerated, and the motives of the Government were falsified. For all
      this exaggeration and falsification the press was largely to blame.
      Moreover, the press, at least in dangerously large proportion, was
      schooling the people to hold Davis personally responsible for all their
      suffering. General Bragg was informed in a letter from a correspondent in
      Mobile that "men have been taught to look upon the President as an
      inexorably self-willed man who will see the country to the devil before
      giving up an opinion or a purpose." This deliberate fostering of an
      anti-Davis spirit might seem less malicious if the fact were not known
      that many editors detested Davis because of his desire to abolish the
      exemption of editors from conscription. Their ignoble course brings to
      mind one of the few sarcasms recorded of Lee&mdash;the remark that the
      great mistake of the South was in making all its best military geniuses
      editors of newspapers. But it must be added in all fairness that the great
      opposition journals, such as the Mercury, took up this new issue with the
      President because they professed to see in his attitude toward the press a
      determination to suppress freedom of speech, so obsessed was the
      opposition with the idea that Davis was a monster! Whatever explanations
      may be offered for the prevalence of graft, the impotence of the
      Government at Richmond contributed to the general demoralization. In
      regions like Georgia and Alabama, the Confederacy was now powerless to
      control its agents. Furthermore, in every effort to assume adequate
      control of the food situation the Government met the continuous opposition
      of two groups of opponents&mdash;the unscrupulous parasites and the bigots
      of economic and constitutional theory. Of the activities of the first
      group, one incident is sufficient to tell the whole story. At Richmond, in
      the autumn of 1864, the grocers were selling rice at two dollars and a
      half a pound. It happened that the Governor of Virginia was William Smith,
      one of the strong men of the Confederacy who has not had his due from the
      historians. He saw that even under the intolerable conditions of the
      moment this price was shockingly exorbitant. To remedy matters, the
      Governor took the State of Virginia into business, bought rice where it
      was grown, imported it, and sold it in Richmond at fifty cents a pound,
      with sufficient profit to cover all costs of handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, when Smith urged the Virginia Legislature to assume control
      of business as a temporary measure, he was at once assailed by the second
      group&mdash;those martinets of constitutionalism who would not give up
      their cherished Anglo-Saxon tradition of complete individualism in
      government. The Administration lost some of its staunchest supporters the
      moment its later organ, the Sentinel, began advocating the general
      regulation of prices. With ruin staring them in the face, these devotees
      of tradition could only reiterate their ancient formulas, nail their
      colors to the mast, end go down, satisfied that, if they failed with these
      principles, they would have failed still more terribly without them.
      Confronting the practical question how to prevent speculators from
      charging 400 per cent profit, these men turned grim but did not abandon
      their theory. In the latter part of 1864 they aligned themselves with the
      opposition when the government commissioners of impressment fixed an
      official schedule that boldly and ruthlessly cut under market prices. The
      attitude of many such people was expressed by the Montgomery Mail when it
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The tendency of the age, the march of the American people, is toward
      monarchy, and unless the tide is stopped we shall reach something worse
      than monarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every step we have taken during the past four years has been in the
      direction of military despotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half our laws are unconstitutional."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another danger of the hour was the melting away of the Confederate army
      under the very eyes of its commanders. The records showed that there were
      100,000 absentees. And though the wrathful officials of the Bureau of
      Conscription labeled them all "deserters," the term covered great numbers
      who had gone home to share the sufferings of their families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such in brief was the fateful background of the congressional attack upon
      the Administration in January, 1865. Secretary Seddon, himself a
      Virginian, believing that he was the main target of the hostility of the
      Virginia delegation, insisted upon resigning. Davis met this determination
      with firmness, not to say infatuation, and in spite of the congressional
      crisis, exhausted every argument to persuade Seddon to remain in office.
      He denied the right of Congress to control his Cabinet, but he was finally
      constrained to allow Seddon to retire. The bitterness inspired by these
      attempts to coerce the President may be gauged by a remark attributed to
      Mrs. Davis. Speaking of the action of Congress in forcing upon him the new
      plan for a single commanding general of all the armies, she is said to
      have exclaimed, "I think I am the proper person to advise Mr. Davis and if
      I were he, I would die or be hung before I would submit to the
      humiliation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless the President surrendered to Congress. On January 26, 1865,
      he signed the bill creating the office of commanding general and at once
      bestowed the office upon Lee. It must not be supposed, however, that Lee
      himself had the slightest sympathy with the congressional cabal which had
      forced upon the President this reorganization of the army. In accepting
      his new position he pointedly ignored Congress by remarking, "I am
      indebted alone to the kindness of His Excellency, the President, for my
      nomination to this high and arduous office."
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular clamor for the restoration of Johnston had still to be
      appeased. Disliking Johnston and knowing that the opposition was using a
      popular general as a club with which to beat himself, Davis hesitated long
      but in the end yielded to the inevitable. To make the reappointment
      himself, however, was too humiliating. He left it to the new
      commander-in-chief, who speedily restored Johnston to command.

    <h2>
      Chapter X. Disintegration
    </h2>
    <p>
      While these factions, despite their disagreements, were making valiant
      efforts to carry on the war, other factions were stealthily cutting the
      ground from under them. There were two groups of men ripe for disaffection&mdash;original
      Unionists unreconciled to the Confederacy and indifferentists conscripted
      against their will.
    </p>
    <p>
      History has been unduly silent about these disaffected men. At the time so
      real was the belief in state rights that contemporaries were reluctant to
      admit that any Southerner, once his State had seceded, could fail to be
      loyal to its commands. Nevertheless in considerable areas&mdash;such, for
      example, as East Tennessee&mdash;the majority remained to the end openly
      for the Union, and there were large regions in the South to which until
      quite recently the eye of the student had not been turned. They were like
      deep shadows under mighty trees on the face of a brilliant landscape. When
      the peasant Unionist who had been forced into the army deserted, however,
      he found in these shadows a nucleus of desperate men ready to combine with
      him in opposition to the local authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus were formed local bands of free companions who pillaged the civilian
      population. The desperadoes whom the deserters joined have been described
      by Professor Dodd as the "neglected byproducts" of the old regime. They
      were broken white men, or the children of such, of the sort that under
      other circumstances have congregated in the slums of great cities. Though
      the South lacked great cities, nevertheless it had its slum&mdash;a
      widespread slum, scattered among its swamps and forests. In these
      fastnesses were the lowest of the poor whites, in whom hatred of the
      dominant whites and vengeful malice against the negro burned like slow
      fires. When almost everywhere the countryside was stripped of its fighting
      men, these wretches emerged from their swamps and forests, like the Paris
      rabble emerging from its dens at the opening of the Revolution. But unlike
      the Frenchmen, they were too sodden to be capable of ideas. Like predatory
      wild beasts they revenged themselves upon the society that had cast them
      off, and with utter heartlessness they smote the now defenseless negro. In
      the old days, with the country well policed, the slaves had been protected
      against their fury, but war now changed all. The negro villages&mdash;or
      "streets," as the term was&mdash;were without arms and without white
      police within call. They were ravaged by these marauders night after
      night, and negroes were not the only victims, for in remote districts even
      murder of the whites became a familiar horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The antiwar factions were not necessarily, however, users of violence.
      There were some men who cherished a dream which they labeled
      "reconstruction"; and there were certain others who believed in separate
      state action, still clinging to the illusion that any State had it in its
      power to escape from war by concluding a separate peace with the United
      States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet neither of these illusions made much headway in the States that had
      borne the strain of intellectual leadership. Virginia and South Carolina,
      though seldom seeing things eye to eye and finally drifting in opposite
      directions, put but little faith in either "reconstruction" or separate
      peace. Their leaders had learned the truth about men and nations; they
      knew that life is a grim business; they knew that war had unloosed
      passions that had to spend themselves and that could not be talked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was scattered over the Confederacy a population which lacked
      experience of the world and which included in the main those small farmers
      and semi-peasants who under the old regime were released from the burden
      of taxation and at the same time excluded from the benefits of education.
      Among these people the illusions of the higher classes were reflected
      without the ballast of mentality. Ready to fight on any provocation, yet
      circumscribed by their own natures, not understanding life, unable to
      picture to themselves different types and conditions, these people were as
      prone as children to confuse the world of their own desire with the world
      of fact. When hardship came, when taxation fell upon them with a great
      blow, when the war took a turn that necessitated imagination for its
      understanding and faith for its pursuit, these people with childlike
      simplicity immediately became panic-stricken. Like the similar class in
      the North, they had measureless faith in talk. Hence for them, as for
      Horace Greeley and many another, sprang up the notion that if only all
      their sort could be brought together for talk and talk and yet more talk,
      the Union could be "reconstructed" just as it used to be, and the cruel
      war would end. Before their eyes, as before Greeley in 1864, danced the
      fata morgana of a convention of all the States, talking, talking, talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peace illusion centered in North Carolina, where the people were as
      enthusiastic for state sovereignty as were any Southerners. They had
      seceded mainly because they felt that this principle had been attacked.
      Having themselves little if any intention to promote slavery, they
      nevertheless were prompt to resent interference with the system or with
      any other Southern institution. Jonathan Worth said that they looked on
      both abolition and secession as children of the devil, and he put the
      responsibility for the secession of his State wholly upon Lincoln and his
      attempt to coerce the lower South. This attitude was probably
      characteristic of all classes in North Carolina. There also an unusually
      large percentage of men lacked education and knowledge of the world. We
      have seen how the first experience with taxation produced instant and
      violent reaction. The peasant farmers of the western counties and the
      general mass of the people began to distrust the planter class. They began
      asking if their allies, the other States, were controlled by that same
      class which seemed to be crushing them by the exaction of tithes. And then
      the popular cry was raised: Was there after all anything in the war for
      the masses in North Carolina? Had they left the frying-pan for the fire?
      Could they better things by withdrawing from association with their
      present allies and going back alone into the Union? The delusion that they
      could do so whenever they pleased and on the old footing seems to have
      been widespread. One of their catch phrases was "the Constitution as it is
      and the Union as it was." Throughout 1863, when the agitation against
      tithes was growing every day, the "conservatives" of North Carolina, as
      their leaders named them, were drawing together in a definite movement for
      peace. This project came to a head during the next year in those grim days
      when Sherman was before Atlanta. Holden, that champion of the opposition
      to tithes, became a candidate for Governor against Vance, who was standing
      for reelection. Holden stated his platform in the organ of his party "If
      the people of North Carolina are for perpetual conscriptions, impressments
      and seizures to keep up a perpetual, devastating and exhausting war, let
      them vote for Governor Vance, for he is for`fighting it out now; but if
      they believe, from the bitter experience of the last three years, that the
      sword can never end it, and are in favor of steps being taken by the State
      to urge negotiations by the general government for an honorable and speedy
      peace, they must vote for Mr. Holden."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Holden, however, was beaten by a vote that stood about three to one,
      Governor Vance continued in power, but just what he stood for and just
      what his supporters understood to be his policy would be hard to say. A
      year earlier he was for attempting to negotiate peace, but though
      professing to have come over to the war party he was never a cordial
      supporter of the Confederacy. In a hundred ways he played upon the strong
      local distrust of Richmond, and upon the feeling that North Carolina was
      being exploited in the interests of the remainder of the South. To cripple
      the efficiency of Confederate conscription was one of his constant aims.
      Whatever his views of the struggle in which he was engaged, they did not
      include either an appreciation of Southern nationalism or the strategist's
      conception of war. Granted that the other States were merely his allies,
      Vance pursued a course that might justly have aroused their suspicion, for
      so far as he was able he devoted the resources of the State wholly to the
      use of its own citizens. The food and the manufactures of North Carolina
      were to be used solely by its own troops, not by troops of the Confederacy
      raised in other States. And yet, subsequent to his reelection, he was not
      a figure in the movement to negotiate peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile in Georgia, where secession had met with powerful opposition,
      the policies of the Government had produced discontent not only with the
      management of the war but with the war itself. And now Alexander H.
      Stephens becomes, for a season, very nearly the central figure of
      Confederate history. Early in 1864 the new act suspending the writ of
      habeas corpus had aroused the wrath of Georgia, and Stephens had become
      the mouthpiece of the opposition. In an address to the Legislature, he
      condemned in most exaggerated language not only the Habeas Corpus Act but
      also the new Conscription Act. Soon afterward he wrote a long letter to
      Herschel V. Johnson, who, like himself, had been an enemy of secession in
      1861. He said that if Johnson doubted that the Habeas Corpus Act was a
      blow struck at the very "vitals of liberty," then he "would not believe
      though one were to rise from the dead." In this extraordinary letter
      Stephens went on "most confidentially" to state his attitude toward Davis
      thus "While I do not and never have regarded him as a great man or
      statesman on a large scale, or a man of any marked genius, yet I have
      regarded him as a man of good intentions, weak and vacillating, timid,
      petulant, peevish, obstinate, but not firm. Am now beginning to doubt his
      good intentions.... His whole policy on the organization and discipline of
      the army is perfectly consistent with the hypothesis that he is aiming at
      absolute power."
    </p>
    <p>
      That a man of Stephens's ability should have dealt in fustian like this in
      the most dreadful moment of Confederate history is a psychological problem
      that is not easily solved. To be sure, Stephens was an extreme instance of
      the martinet of constitutionalism. He reminds us of those old-fashioned
      generals of whom Macaulay said that they preferred to lose a battle
      according to rule than win it by an exception. Such men find it easy to
      transform into a bugaboo any one who appears to them to be acting
      irregularly. Stephens in his own mind had so transformed the President.
      The enormous difficulties and the wholly abnormal circumstances which
      surrounded Davis counted with Stephens for nothing at all, and he reasoned
      about the Administration as if it were operating in a vacuum. Having come
      to this extraordinary position, Stephens passed easily into a role that
      verged upon treason. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * There can be no question that Stephens never did anything
     which in his own mind was in the least disloyal. And yet it
     was Stephens who, in the autumn of 1864, was singled out by
     artful men as a possible figurehead in the conduct of a
     separate peace negotiation with Sherman. A critic very
     hostile to Stephens and his faction might here raise the
     question as to what was at bottom the motive of Governor
     Brown, in the autumn of 1864, in withdrawing the Georgia
     militia from Hood's command. Was there something afoot that
     has never quite revealed itself on the broad pages of
     history? As ordinarily told, the story is simply that
     certain desperate Georgians asked Stephens to be their
     ambassador to Sherman to discuss terms; that Sherman had
     given them encouragement; but that Stephens avoided the
     trap, and so nothing came of it. The recently published
     correspondence of Toombs, Stephens, and Cobb, however,
     contains one passage that has rather a startling sound.
     Brown, writing to Stephens regarding his letter refusing to
     meet Sherman, says, "It keeps the door open and I think this
     is wise." At the same time he made a public statement that
     "Georgia has power to act independently but her faith is
     pledged by implication to her Southern sisters... will
     triumph with her Southern sisters or sink with them in
     common ruin." It is still to be discovered what "door"
     Stephens was supposed to have kept open.  Peace talk was now
     in the air, and especially was there chatter about
     reconstruction. The illusionists seemed unable to perceive
     that the reelection of Lincoln had robbed them of their last
     card. These dreamers did not even pause to wonder why after
     the terrible successes of the Federal army in Georgia,
     Lincoln should be expected to reverse his policy and restore
     the Union with the Southern States on the old footing. The
     peace mania also invaded South Carolina and was espoused by
     one of its Congressmen, Mr. Boyce, but he made few converts
     among his own people. The Mercury scouted the idea; clear-
     sighted and disillusioned, it saw the only alternatives to
     be victory or subjugation. Boyce's argument was that the
     South had already succumbed to military despotism and would
     have to endure it forever unless it accepted the terms of
     the invaders. News of Boyce's attitude called forth vigorous
     protest from the army before Petersburg, and even went so
     far afield as New York, where it was discussed in the
     columns of the Herald.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the midst of the Northern elections, when Davis was hoping great things
      from the anti-Lincoln men, Stephens had said in print that he believed
      Davis really wished the Northern peace party defeated, whereupon Davis had
      written to him demanding reasons for this astounding charge. To the
      letter, which had missed Stephens at his home and had followed him late in
      the year to Richmond, Stephens wrote in the middle of December a long
      reply which is one of the most curious documents in American history. He
      justified himself upon two grounds. One was a statement which Davis had
      made in a speech at Columbia, in October, indicating that he was averse to
      the scheme of certain Northern peace men for a convention of all the
      States. Stephens insisted that such a convention would have ended the war
      and secured the independence of the South. Davis cleared himself on this
      charge by saying that the speech at Columbia "was delivered after the
      publication of McClellan's letter avowing his purpose to force reunion by
      war if we declined reconstruction when offered, and therefore warned the
      people against delusive hopes of peace from any other influence than that
      to be exerted by the manifestation of an unconquerable spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Stephens professed to have independence and not reconstruction for his
      aim, he had missed his mark with this first shot. He fared still worse
      with the second. During the previous spring a Northern soldier captured in
      the southeast had appealed for parole on the ground that he was a secret
      emissary to the President from the peace men of the North. Davis, who did
      not take him seriously, gave orders to have the case investigated, but
      Stephens, whose mentality in this period is so curiously overcast,
      swallowed the prisoner's story without hesitation. He and Davis had a
      considerable amount of correspondence on the subject. In the fierce
      tension of the summer of 1864 the War Department went so far as to have
      the man's character investigated, but the report was unsatisfactory. He
      was not paroled and died in prison. This episode Stephens now brought
      forward as evidence that Davis had frustrated an attempt of the Northern
      peace party to negotiate. Davis contented himself with replying, "I make
      no comment on this."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next step in the peace intrigue took place at the opening of the next
      year, 1865. Stephens attempted to address the Senate on his favorite
      topic, the wickedness of the suspension of habeas corpus; was halted by a
      point of parliamentary law; and when the Senate sustained an appeal from
      his decision, left the chamber in a pique. Hunter, now a Senator, became
      an envoy to placate him and succeeded in bringing him back. Thereupon
      Stephens poured out his soul in a furious attack upon the Administration.
      He ended by submitting resolutions which were just what he might have
      submitted four years earlier before a gun had been fired, so entirely had
      his mind crystallized in the stress of war! These resolutions, besides
      reasserting the full state rights theory, assumed the readiness of the
      North to make peace and called for a general convention of all the States
      to draw up some new arrangement on a confessed state rights basis. More
      than a month before, Lincoln had been reelected on an unequivocal
      nationalistic platform. And yet Stephens continued to believe that the
      Northerners did not mean what they said and that in congregated talking
      lay the magic which would change the world of fact into the world of his
      own desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point in the peace intrigue the ambiguous figure of Napoleon the
      Little reappears, though only to pass ghostlike across the back of the
      stage. The determination of Northern leaders to oppose Napoleon had
      suggested to shrewd politicians a possible change of front. That singular
      member of the Confederate Congress, Henry S. Foote, thought he saw in the
      Mexican imbroglio means to bring Lincoln to terms. In November he had
      introduced into the House resolutions which intimated that "it might
      become the true policy of... the Confederate States to consent to the
      yielding of the great principle embodied in the Monroe Doctrine." The
      House referred his resolutions to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and
      there they slumbered until January.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile a Northern politician brought on the specter of Napoleon for a
      different purpose. Early in January, 1865, Francis P. Blair made a journey
      to Richmond and proposed to Davis a plan of reconciliation involving the
      complete abandonment of slavery, the reunion of all the States, and an
      expedition against Mexico in which Davis was to play the leading role.
      Davis cautiously refrained from committing himself, though he gave Blair a
      letter in which he expressed his willingness to enter into negotiations
      for peace between "the two countries." The visit of Blair gave new impetus
      to the peace intrigue. The Confederate House Committee on Foreign Affairs
      reported resolutions favoring an attempt to negotiate with the United
      States so as to "bring into view" the possibility of cooperation between
      the United States and the Confederacy to maintain the Monroe Doctrine. The
      same day saw another singular incident. For some reason that has never
      been divulged Foote determined to counterbalance Blair's visit to Richmond
      by a visit of his own to Washington. In attempting to pass through the
      Confederate lines he was arrested by the military authorities. With this
      fiasco Foote passes from the stage of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doings of Blair, however, continued to be a topic of general interest
      throughout January. The military intrigue was now simmering down through
      the creation of the office of commanding general. The attempt of the
      congressional opposition to drive the whole Cabinet from office reached a
      compromise in the single retirement of the Secretary of War. Before the
      end of the month the peace question was the paramount one before Congress
      and the country. Newspapers discussed the movements of Blair, apparently
      with little knowledge, and some of the papers asserted hopefully that
      peace was within reach. Cooler heads, such as the majority of the Virginia
      Legislature, rejected this idea as baseless. The Mercury called the peace
      party the worst enemy of the South. Lee was reported by the Richmond
      correspondent of the Mercury as not caring a fig for the peace project.
      Nevertheless the rumor persisted that Blair had offered peace on terms
      that the Confederacy could accept. Late in the month, Davis appointed
      Stephens, Hunter, and John A. Campbell commissioners to confer with the
      Northern authorities with regard to peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed the famous conference of February 3, 1865, in the cabin of
      a steamer at Hampton Roads, with Seward and Lincoln. The Confederate
      commissioners represented two points of view: that of the Administration,
      unwilling to make peace without independence; and that of the infatuated
      Stephens who clung to the idea that Lincoln did not mean what he said, and
      who now urged "an armistice allowing the States to adjust themselves as
      suited their interests. If it would be to their interests to reunite, they
      would do so." The refusal of Lincoln to consider either of these points of
      view&mdash;the refusal so clearly foreseen by Davis&mdash;put an end to
      the career of Stephens. He was "hoist with his own petard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of the failure of the conference was variously received. The
      Mercury rejoiced because there was now no doubt how things stood.
      Stephens, unwilling to cooperate with the Administration, left the capital
      and went home to Georgia. At Richmond, though the snow lay thick on the
      ground, a great public meeting was held on the 6th of February in the
      precincts of the African Church. Here Davis made an address which has been
      called his greatest and which produced a profound impression. A wave of
      enthusiasm swept over Richmond, and for a moment the President appeared
      once more to be master of the situation. His immense audacity carried the
      people with him when, after showing what might be done by more drastic
      enforcement of the conscription laws, he concluded: "Let us then unite our
      hands and our hearts, lock our shields together, and we may well believe
      that before another summer solstice falls upon us, it will be the enemy
      that will be asking us for conferences and occasions in which to make
      known our demands."

      Chapter XI. An Attempted Revolution
    </h2>
    <p>
      Almost from the moment when the South had declared its independence voices
      had been raised in favor of arming the negroes. The rejection of a plan to
      accomplish this was one of the incidents of Benjamin's tenure of the
      portfolio of the War Department; but it was not until the early days of
      1864, when the forces of Johnston lay encamped at Dalton, Georgia, that
      the arming of the slaves was seriously discussed by a council of officers.
      Even then the proposal had its determined champions, though there were
      others among Johnston's officers who regarded it as "contrary to all true
      principles of chivalric warfare," and their votes prevailed in the council
      by a large majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time forward the question of arming the slaves hung like a heavy
      cloud over all Confederate thought of the war. It was discussed in the
      army and at home around troubled firesides. Letters written from the
      trenches at Petersburg show that it was debated by the soldiers, and the
      intense repugnance which the idea inspired in some minds was shown by
      threats to leave the ranks if the slaves were given arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the pressing, obvious issues of 1864, this project hardly appears
      upon the face of the record until it was alluded to in Davis's message to
      Congress in November, 1864, and in the annual report of the Secretary of
      War. The President did not as yet ask for slave soldiers. He did, however,
      ask for the privilege of buying slaves for government use&mdash;not merely
      hiring them from their owners as had hitherto been done&mdash;and for
      permission, if the Government so desired, to emancipate them at the end of
      their service. The Secretary of War went farther, however, and advocated
      negro soldiers, and he too suggested their emancipation at the end of
      service.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feeling of the temper of the country, so to speak, produced an
      immediate response. It drew Rhett from his retirement and inspired a
      letter in which he took the Government severely to task for designing to
      remove from state control this matter of fundamental importance.
      Coinciding with the cry for more troops with which to confront Sherman,
      the topic of negro soldiers became at once one of the questions of the
      hour. It helped to focus that violent anti-Davis movement which is the
      conspicuous event of December, 1864, and January, 1865. Those who believed
      the President unscrupulous trembled at the thought of putting into his
      hands a great army of hardy barbarians trained to absolute obedience. The
      prospect of such a weapon held in one firm hand at Richmond seemed to
      those opponents of the President a greater menace to their liberties than
      even the armies of the invaders. It is quite likely that distrust of Davis
      and dread of the use he might make of such a weapon was increased by a
      letter from Benjamin to Frederick A. Porcher of Charleston, a supporter of
      the Government, who had made rash suggestions as to the
      extra-constitutional power that the Administration might be justified by
      circumstances in assuming. Benjamin deprecated such suggestions but
      concluded with the unfortunate remark: "If the Constitution is not to be
      our guide I would prefer to see it suppressed by a revolution which should
      declare a dictatorship during the war, after the manner of ancient Rome,
      leaving to the future the care of reestablishing firm and regular
      government." In the State of Virginia, indeed, the revolutionary
      suggestions of the President's message and the Secretary's report were
      promptly taken up and made the basis of a political program, which
      Governor Smith embodied in his message to the Legislature&mdash;a document
      that will eventually take its place among the most interesting state
      papers of the Confederacy. It should be noted that the suggestions thrown
      out in this way by the Administration to test public feeling involved
      three distinct questions: Should the slaves be given arms? Should they, if
      employed as soldiers, be given their freedom? Should this revolutionary
      scheme, if accepted at all, be handled by the general Government or left
      to the several States? On the last of the three questions the Governor of
      Virginia was silent; by implication he treated the matter as a concern of
      the States. Upon the first and second questions, however, he was explicit
      and advised arming the slaves. He then added:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even if the result were to emancipate our slaves, there is not a man who
      would not cheerfully put the negro into the Army rather than become a
      slave himself to our hated and vindictive foe. It is, then, simply a
      question of time. Has the time arrived when this issue is fairly before
      us?... For my part standing before God and my country, I do not hesitate
      to say that I would arm such portion of our able-bodied slave population
      as may be necessary, and put them in the field, so as to have them ready
      for the spring campaign, even if it resulted in the freedom of those thus
      organized. Will I not employ them to fight the negro force of the enemy?
      Aye, the Yankees themselves, who already boast that they have 200,000 of
      our slaves in arms against us. Can we hesitate, can we doubt, when the
      question is, whether the enemy shall use our slaves against us or we use
      them against him; when the question may be between liberty and
      independence on the one hand, or our subjugation and utter ruin on the
      other?"

      With their Governor as leader for the Administration, the Virginians found
      this issue the absorbing topic of the hour. And now the great figure of
      Lee takes its rightful place at the very center of Confederate history,
      not only military but civil, for to Lee the Virginia politicians turned
      for advice. * In a letter to a State Senator of Virginia who had asked for
      a public expression of Lee's views because "a mountain of prejudices,
      growing out of our ancient modes of regarding the institution of Southern
      slavery will have to be met and overcome" in order to Attain unanimity,
      Lee discussed both the institution of slavery and the situation of the
      moment. He plainly intimated that slavery should be placed under state
      control; and, assuming such control, be considered "the relation of master
      and slave... the best that can exist between the black and white races
      while intermingled as at present in this country." He went on to show,
      however, that military necessity now compelled a revolution in sentiment
      on this subject, and he came at last to this momentous conclusion:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Lee now revealed himself in his previously overlooked
     capacity of statesman. Whether his abilities in this respect
     equaled his abilities as a soldier need not here be
     considered; it is said that he himself had no high opinion
     of them. However, in the advice which he gave at this final
     moment of crisis, he expressed a definite conception of the
     articulation of civil forces in such a system as that of the
     Confederacy. He held that all initiative upon basal matters
     should remain with the separate States, that the function of
     the general Government was to administer, not to create
     conditions, and that the proper power to constrain the State
     Legislatures was the flexible, extra-legal power of public
     opinion.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Should the war continue under existing circumstances, the enemy may in
      course of time penetrate our country and get access to a large part of our
      negro population. It is his avowed policy to convert the able-bodied men
      among them into soldiers, and to emancipate all.... His progress will thus
      add to his numbers, and at the same time destroy slavery in a manner most
      pernicious to the welfare of our people. Their negroes will be used to
      hold them in subjection, leaving the remaining force of the enemy free to
      extend his conquest. Whatever may be the effect of our employing negro
      troops, it cannot be as mischievous as this. If it end in subverting
      slavery it will be accomplished by ourselves, and we can devise the means
      of alleviating the evil consequences to both races. I think, therefore, we
      must decide whether slavery shall be extinguished by our enemies and the
      slaves be used against us, or use them ourselves at the risk of the
      effects which may be produced upon our social institutions..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reasons that induce me to recommend the employment of negro troops at
      all render the effect of the measures... upon slavery immaterial, and in
      my opinion the best means of securing the efficiency and fidelity of this
      auxiliary force would be to accompany the measure with a well-digested
      plan of gradual and general emancipation. As that will be the result of
      the continuance of the war, and will certainly occur if the enemy succeed,
      it seems to me most advisable to adopt it at once, and thereby obtain all
      the benefits that will accrue to our cause..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only say in conclusion, that whatever measures are to be adopted
      should be adopted at once. Every day's delay increases the difficulty.
      Much time will be required to organize and discipline the men, and action
      may be deferred until it is too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lee wrote these words on January 11, 1865. At that time a fresh wave of
      despondency had gone over the South because of Hood's rout at Nashville;
      Congress was debating intermittently the possible arming of the slaves;
      and the newspapers were prophesying that the Administration would
      presently force the issue. It is to be observed that Lee did not advise
      Virginia to wait for Confederate action. He advocated emancipation by the
      State. After all, to both Lee and Smith, Virginia was their "country."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next sixty days Lee rejected two great opportunities&mdash;or,
      if you will, put aside two great temptations. If tradition is to be
      trusted, it was during January that Lee refused to play the role of
      Cromwell by declining to intervene directly in general Confederate
      politics. But there remained open the possibility of his intervention in
      Virginia politics, and the local crisis was in its own way as momentous as
      the general crisis. What if Virginia had accepted the views of Lee and
      insisted upon the immediate arming of the slaves? Virginia, however, did
      not do so; and Lee, having made public his position, refrained from
      further participation. Politically speaking, he maintained a splendid
      isolation at the head of the armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through January and February the Virginia crisis continued undetermined.
      In this period of fateful hesitation, the "mountains of prejudice" proved
      too great to be undermined even by the influence of Lee. When at last
      Virginia enacted a law permitting the arming of her slaves, no provision
      was made for their manumission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before the passage of this act in Virginia, Congress had become the
      center of the controversy. Davis had come to the point where no tradition
      however cherished would stand, in his mind, against the needs of the
      moment. To reinforce the army in great strength was now his supreme
      concern, and he saw but one way to do it. As a last resort he was prepared
      to embrace the bold plan which so many people still regarded with horror
      and which as late as the previous November he himself had opposed. He
      would arm the slaves. On February 10, 1865, bills providing for the arming
      of the slaves were introduced both in the House and in the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this issue all the forces both of the Government and the opposition
      fought their concluding duel in which were involved all the other basal
      issues that had distracted the country since 1862. Naturally there was a
      bewildering criss-cross of political motives. There were men who, like
      Smith and Lee, would go along with the Government on emancipation,
      provided it was to be carried out by the free will of the States. There
      were others who preferred subjugation to the arming of the slaves; and
      among these there were clashings of motive. Then, too, there were those
      who were willing to arm the slaves but were resolved not to give them
      their freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The debate brings to the front of the political stage the figure of R. M.
      T. Hunter. Hitherto his part has not been conspicuous either as Secretary
      of State or as Senator from Virginia. He now becomes, in the words of
      Davis, "a chief obstacle" to the passage of the Senate bill which would
      have authorized a levy of negro troops and provided for their manumission
      by the War Department with the consent of the State in which they should
      be at the time of the proposed manumission. After long discussion, this
      bill was indefinitely postponed. Meanwhile a very different bill had
      dragged through the House. While it was under debate, another appeal was
      made to Lee. Barksdale, who came as near as any one to being the leader of
      the Administration, sought Lee's aid. Again the General urged the
      enrollment of negro soldiers and their eventual manumission, but added
      this immensely significant proviso:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt that if Congress would authorize their [the negroes']
      reception into service, and empower the President to call upon individuals
      or States for such as they are willing to contribute, with the condition
      of emancipation to all enrolled, a sufficient number would be forthcoming
      to enable us to try the experiment [of determining whether the slaves
      would make good soldiers]. If it proved successful, most of the objections
      to the measure would disappear, and if individuals still remained
      unwilling to send their negroes to the army, the force of public opinion
      in the States would soon bring about such legislation as would remove all
      obstacles. I think the matter should be left, as far as possible, to the
      people and to the States, which alone can legislate as the necessities of
      this particular service may require."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that Congress had before it this advice from Lee explains why all
      factions accepted a compromise bill, passed on the 9th of March, approved
      by the President on the 13th of March, and issued to the country in a
      general order on the 23d of March. It empowered the President to "ask for
      and accept from the owners of slaves" the service of such number of
      negroes as he saw fit, and if sufficient number were not offered to "call
      on each State... for her quota of 300,000 troops... to be raised from such
      classes of the population, irrespective of color, in each State as the
      proper authorities thereof may determine." However, "nothing in this act
      shall be construed to authorize a change in the relation which the said
      slaves shall bear toward their owners, except by consent of the owners and
      of the States in which they may reside and in pursuance of the laws
      thereof."
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of this act were negligible. Its failure to offer the
      slave-soldier his freedom was at once seized upon by critics as evidence
      of the futility of the course of the Administration. The sneer went round
      that the negro was to be made to fight for his own captivity. Pollard&mdash;whose
      words, however, must be taken with a grain of salt&mdash;has left this
      account of recruiting under the new act: "Two companies of blacks,
      organized from some negro vagabonds in Richmond, were allowed to give
      balls at the Libby Prison and were exhibited in fine fresh uniforms on
      Capitol Square as decoys to obtain recruits. But the mass of their colored
      brethren looked on the parade with unenvious eyes, and little boys
      exhibited the early prejudices of race by pelting the fine uniforms with
      mud."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless both Davis and Lee busied themselves in the endeavor to raise
      black troops. Governor Smith cooperated with them. And in the mind of the
      President there was no abandonment of the program of emancipation, which
      was now his cardinal policy. Soon after the passage of the act, he wrote
      to Smith: "I am happy to receive your assurance of success [in raising
      black troops], as well as your promise to seek legislation to secure
      unmistakable freedom to the slave who shall enter the Army, with a right
      to return to his old home, when he shall have been honorably discharged
      from military service."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this final controversy was being fought out in Congress, the
      enthusiasm for the Administration had again ebbed. Its recovery of
      prestige had run a brief course and was gone, and now in the midst of the
      discussion over the negro soldiers' bills, the opposition once more
      attacked the Cabinet, with its old enemy, Benjamin, as the target.
      Resolutions were introduced into the Senate declaring that "the retirement
      of the Honorable Judah P. Benjamin from the State Department will be
      subservient of the public interests"; in the House resolutions were
      offered describing his public utterances as "derogatory to his position as
      a high public functionary of the Confederate Government, a reflection on
      the motives of Congress as a deliberative body, and an insult to public
      opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Congress wrangled and delayed while the wave of fire that was Sherman's
      advance moved northward through the Carolinas. Columbia had gone up in
      smoke while the Senate debated day after day&mdash;fifteen in all&mdash;what
      to do with the compromise bill sent up to it from the House. It was during
      this period that a new complication appears to have been added to a
      situation which was already so hopelessly entangled, for this was the time
      when Governor Magrath made a proposal to Governor Vance for a league
      within the Confederacy, giving as his chief reason that Virginia's
      interests were parting company with those of the lower South. The same
      doubt of the upper South appears at various times in the Mercury. And
      through all the tactics of the opposition runs the constant effort to
      discredit Davis. The Mercury scoffed at the agitation for negro soldiers
      as a mad attempt on the part of the Administration to remedy its "myriad
      previous blunders."
    </p>
    <p>
      In these terrible days, the mind of Davis hardened. He became possessed by
      a lofty and intolerant confidence, an absolute conviction that, in spite
      of all appearances, he was on the threshold of success. We may safely
      ascribe to him in these days that illusory state of mind which has
      characterized some of the greatest of men in their over-strained,
      concluding periods. His extraordinary promises in his later messages, a
      series of vain prophecies beginning with his speech at the African Church,
      remind one of Napoleon after Leipzig refusing the Rhine as a boundary. His
      nerves, too, were all but at the breaking point. He sent the Senate a
      scolding message because of its delay in passing the Negro Soldiers' Bill.
      The Senate answered in a report that was sharply critical of his own
      course. Shortly afterward Congress adjourned refusing his request for
      another suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Davis had hinted at important matters he hoped soon to be able to submit
      to Congress. What he had in mind was the last, the boldest, stroke of this
      period of desperation. The policy of emancipation he and Benjamin had
      accepted without reserve. They had at last perceived, too late, the power
      of the anti-slavery movement in Europe. Though they had already failed to
      coerce England through cotton and had been played with and abandoned by
      Napoleon, they persisted in thinking that there was still a chance for a
      third chapter in their foreign affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agitation to arm the slaves, with the promise of freedom, had another
      motive besides the reinforcement of Lee's army: it was intended to serve
      as a basis for negotiations with England and France. To that end D. J.
      Kenner was dispatched to Europe early in 1865. Passing through New York in
      disguise, he carried word of this revolutionary program to the Confederate
      commissioners abroad. A conference at Paris was held by Kenner, Mason, and
      Slidell. Mason, who had gone over to England to sound Palmerston with
      regard to this last Confederate hope, was received on the 14th of March.
      On the previous day, Davis had accepted temporary defeat, by signing the
      compromise bill which omitted emancipation. But as there was no cable
      operating at the time, Mason was not aware of this rebuff. In his own
      words, he "urged upon Lord P. that if the President was right in his
      impression that there was some latent, undisclosed obstacle on the part of
      Great Britain to recognition, it should be frankly stated, and we might,
      if in our power to do so, consent to remove it." Palmerston, though his
      manner was "conciliatory and kind," insisted that there was nothing
      "underlying" his previous statements, and that he could not, in view of
      the facts then existing, regard the Confederacy in the light of an
      independent power. Mason parted from him convinced that "the most ample
      concessions on our part in the matter referred to would have produced no
      change in the course determined on by the British Government with regard
      to recognition." In a subsequent interview with Lord Donoughmore, he was
      frankly told that the offer of emancipation had come too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispatch in which Mason reported the attitude of the British
      Government never reached the Confederate authorities. It was dated the
      31st of March. Two days later Richmond was evacuated by the Confederate
      Government.

    <h2>
      Chapter XII. The Last Word
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evacuation of Richmond broke the back of the Confederate defense.
      Congress had adjourned. The legislative history of the Confederacy was at
      an end. The executive history still had a few days to run. After
      destroying great quantities of records, the government officials had
      packed the remainder on a long train that conveyed the President and what
      was left of the civil service to Danville. During a few days, Danville was
      the Confederate capital. There, Davis, still unable to conceive defeat,
      issued his pathetic last Address to the People of the Confederate States.
      His mind was crystallized. He was no longer capable of judging facts. In
      as confident tones as ever he promised his people that they should yet
      prevail; he assured Virginians that even if the Confederate army should
      withdraw further south the withdrawal would be but temporary, and that
      "again and again will we return until the baffled and exhausted enemy
      shall abandon in despair his endless and impossible task of making slaves
      of a people resolved to be free."
    </p>
    <p>
      The surrender at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, compelled another migration
      of the dwindling executive company. General Johnston had not yet
      surrendered. A conference which he had with the President and the Cabinet
      at Greensboro ended in giving him permission to negotiate with Sherman.
      Even then Davis was still bent on keeping up the fight; yet, though he
      believed that Sherman would reject Johnston's overtures, he was overtaken
      at Charlotte on his way South by the crushing news of Johnston's
      surrender. There the executive history of the Confederacy came to an end
      in a final Cabinet meeting. Davis, still blindly resolute to continue the
      struggle, was deeply distressed by the determination of his advisers to
      abandon it. In imminent danger of capture, the President's party made its
      way to Abbeville, where it broke up, and each member sought safety as best
      he could. Davis with a few faithful men rode to Irwinsville, Georgia,
      where, in the early morning of the 10th of May, he was surprised and
      captured. But the history of the Confederacy was not quite at an end. The
      last gunshots were still to be fired far away in Texas on the 13th of May.
      The surrender of the forces of the Trans-Mississippi on May 26, 1865,
      brought the war to a definite conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remains one incident of these closing days, the significance of
      which was not perceived until long afterward, when it immediately took its
      rightful place among the determining events of American history. The
      unconquerable spirit of the Army of Northern Virginia found its last
      expression in a proposal which was made to Lee by his officers. If he
      would give the word, they would make the war a duel to the death; it
      should drag out in relentless guerrilla struggles; and there should be no
      pacification of the South until the fighting classes had been
      exterminated. Considering what those classes were, considering the
      qualities that could be handed on to their posterity, one realizes that
      this suicide of a whole people, of a noble fighting people, would have
      maimed incalculably the America of the future. But though the heroism of
      this proposal of his men to die on their shields had its stern charm for
      so brave a man as Lee, he refused to consider it. He would not admit that
      he and his people had a right thus to extinguish their power to help mold
      the future, no matter whether it be the future they desired or not. The
      result of battle must be accepted. The Southern spirit must not perish,
      luxuriating blindly in despair, but must find a new form of expression,
      must become part of the new world that was to be, must look to a new birth
      under new conditions. In this spirit he issued to his army his last
      address:
    </p>
    <p>
      "After four years of arduous service, marked by unsurpassed courage and
      fortitude, the Army of Northern Virginia has been compelled to yield to
      overwhelming numbers and resources. I need not tell the survivors of so
      many hard-fought battles, who have remained steadfast to the last, that I
      have consented to the result from no distrust of them; but feeling that
      valor and devotion could accomplish nothing that could compensate for the
      loss that would have attended the continuation of the contest, I
      determined to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose past services
      have endeared them to their countrymen.... I bid you an affectionate
      farewell."
    </p>
    <p>
      How inevitably one calls to mind, in view of the indomitable valor of
      Lee's final decision, those great lines from Tennyson:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
     We are not now that strength which in old days
     Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
     One equal temper of heroic hearts,
     Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will."

      BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is no adequate history of the Confederacy. It is rumored that a
      distinguished scholar has a great work approaching completion. It is also
      rumored that another scholar, well equipped to do so, will soon bring out
      a monumental life of Davis. But the fact remains that as yet we lack a
      comprehensive review of the Confederate episode set in proper perspective.
      Standard works such as the "History of the United States from the
      Compromise of 1850", by J. F. Rhodes (7 vols., 1893-1908), even when
      otherwise as near a classic as is the work of Mr. Rhodes, treat the
      Confederacy so externally as to have in this respect little value. The one
      searching study of the subject, "The Confederate States of America," by J.
      C. Schwab (1901), though admirable in its way, is wholly overshadowed by
      the point of view of the economist. The same is to be said of the article
      by Professor Schwab in the 11th edition of "The Encyclopaedia Britannica."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two famous discussions of the episode by participants are: "The Rise and
      Fall of the Confederate Government," by the President of the Confederacy
      (2 vols., 1881), and "A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the
      States," by Alexander H. Stephens (2 vols., 1870). Both works, though
      invaluable to the student, are tinged with controversy, each of the
      eminent authors aiming to refute the arguments of political antagonists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military history of the time has so overshadowed the civil, in the
      minds of most students, that we are still sadly in need of careful,
      disinterested studies of the great figures of Confederate civil affairs.
      "Jefferson Davis," by William E. Dodd ("American Crisis Biographies,"
      1907), is the standard life of the President, superseding older ones. Not
      so satisfactory in the same series is "Judah P. Benjamin," by Pierce
      Butler (1907), and "Alexander H. Stephens," by Louis Pendleton (1907).
      Older works which are valuable for the material they contain are: "Memoir
      of Jefferson Davis," by his Wife (1890); "The Life and Times of Alexander
      H. Stephens," by R. M. Johnston and W. M. Browne (1878); "The Life and
      Times of William Lowndes Yancey," by J. W. Du Bose (1891); "The Life,
      Times, and Speeches of Joseph E. Brown," by Herbert Fielder (1883);
      "Public Life and Diplomatic Correspondence of James M. Mason," by his
      Daughter (1903); "The Life and Time of C. G. Memminger," by H. D. Capers
      (1893). The writings of E. A. Pollard cannot be disregarded, but must be
      taken as the violent expression of an extreme partisan. They include a
      "Life of Jefferson Davis" (1869) and "The Lost Cause" (1867). A charming
      series of essays is "Confederate Portraits," by Gamaliel Bradford (1914).
      Among books on special topics that are to be recommended are: "The
      Diplomatic History of the Southern Confederacy" by J. M. Callahan (1901);
      "France and the Confederate Navy," by John Bigelow (1888); and "The Secret
      Service of the Confederate States in Europe," by J. D. Bulloch (2 vols.,
      1884). There is a large number of contemporary accounts of life in the
      Confederacy. Historians have generally given excessive attention to "A
      Rebel War Clerk's Diary at the Confederate States Capital," by J. B. Jones
      (2 vols., 1866) which has really neither more nor less value than a
      Richmond newspaper. Conspicuous among writings of this type is the
      delightful "Diary from Dixie," by Mrs. Mary B. Chestnut (1905) and "My
      Diary, North and South," by W. H. Russell (1861).
    </p>
    <p>
      The documents of the civil history, so far as they are accessible to the
      general reader, are to be found in the three volumes forming the fourth
      series of the "Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies" (128
      vols., 1880-1901); the "Journals of the Congress of the Confederate
      States" (8 vols., 1904) and "Messages and Papers of the Confederacy,"
      edited by J. D. Richardson (2 vols., 1905). Four newspapers are of first
      importance: the famous opposition organs, the Richmond Examiner and the
      Charleston Mercury, which should be offset by the two leading organs of
      the Government, the Courier of Charleston and the Enquirer of Richmond.
      The Statutes of the Confederacy have been collected and published; most of
      them are also to be found in the fourth series of the Official Records.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
