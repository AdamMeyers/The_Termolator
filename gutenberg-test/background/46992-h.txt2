Preface

By Bernard Shaw.

From Molière to Brieux.

After the death of Ibsen, Brieux confronted Europe as
the most important dramatist west of Russia. In that kind
of comedy which is so true to life that we have to call it
tragi-comedy, and which is not only an entertainment but
a history and a criticism of contemporary morals, he is incomparably
the greatest writer France has produced since
Molière. The French critics who take it for granted that
no contemporary of theirs could possibly be greater than
Beaumarchais are really too modest. They have never
read Beaumarchais, and therefore do not know how very
little of him there is to read, and how, out of the two variations
he wrote on his once famous theme, the second
is only a petition in artistic and intellectual bankruptcy.
Had the French theatre been capable of offering a field
to Balzac, my proposition might have to be modified. But
as it was no more able to do that than the English theatre
was to enlist the genius of Dickens, I may say confidently
that in that great comedy which Balzac called ‘the comedy
of humanity,’ to be played for the amusement of the
gods rather than for that of the French public, there is
no summit in the barren plain that stretches from Mount
Molière to our own times until we reach Brieux.

How the XIX century found itself out.

It is reserved for some great critic to give us a study of
the psychology of the XIX century. Those of us who as
adults saw it face to face in that last moiety of its days
when one fierce hand after another—Marx’s, Zola’s, Ibsen’s,
Strindberg’s, Turgenief’s, Tolstoy’s—stripped its
masks off and revealed it as, on the whole, perhaps the
most villainous page of recorded human history, can also
recall the strange confidence with which it regarded itself
as the very summit of civilization, and talked of the past
as a cruel gloom that had been dispelled for ever by the
railway and the electric telegraph. But centuries, like
men, begin to find themselves out in middle age. The
youthful conceit of the nineteenth had a splendid exponent
in Macaulay, and, for a time, a gloriously jolly one
during the nonage of Dickens. There was certainly nothing
morbid in the air then: Dickens and Macaulay are
as free from morbidity as Dumas père and Guizot. Even
Stendhal and Prosper Merimée, though by no means
burgess optimists, are quite sane. When you come to Zola
and Maupassant, Flaubert and the Goncourts, to Ibsen
and Strindberg, to Aubrey Beardsley and George Moore,
to D’Annunzio and Echegaray, you are in a new and
morbid atmosphere. French literature up to the middle
of the XIX century was still all of one piece with Rabelais,
Montaigne and Molière. Zola breaks that tradition completely:
he is as different as Karl Marx from Turgot or
Darwin from Cuvier.

In this new phase we see the bourgeoisie, after a century
and a half of complacent vaunting of its own probity and
modest happiness (begun by Daniel Defoe in Robinson
Crusoe’s praises of ‘the middle station of life’), suddenly
turning bitterly on itself with accusations of hideous sexual
and commercial corruption. Thackeray’s campaign
against snobbery and Dickens’s against hypocrisy were
directed against the vices of respectable men; but nowxi
even the respectability was passionately denied: the
bourgeois was depicted as a thief, a tyrant, a sweater, a
selfish voluptuary whose marriages were simple legalizations
of unbridled licentiousness. Sexual irregularities
began to be attributed to the sympathetic characters in
fiction not as the blackest spots in their portraits, but
positively as redeeming humanities in them.

Jack the Ripper.

I am by no means going here either to revive the old
outcry against this school of iconoclasts and disillusioners,
or to join the new reaction against it. It told the world
many truths: it brought romance back to its senses. Its
very repudiation of the graces and enchantments of fine
art was necessary; for the artistic morbidezza of Byron
and Victor Hugo was too imaginative to allow the Victorian
bourgeoisie to accept them as chroniclers of real
facts and real people. The justification of Zola’s comparative
coarseness is that his work could not have been
done in any other way. If Zola had had a sense of humor,
or a great artist’s delight in playing with his ideas, his
materials, and his readers, he would have become either
as unreadable to the very people he came to wake up as
Anatole France is, or as incredible as Victor Hugo was.
He would also have incurred the mistrust and hatred of
the majority of Frenchmen, who, like the majority of men
of all nations, are not merely incapable of fine art, but resent
it furiously. A wit is to them a man who is laughing
at them: an artist is a man of loose character who lives by
telling lying stories and pandering to the voluptuous
passions. What they like to read is the police intelligence,
especially the murder cases and divorce cases. The
invented murders and divorces of the novelists and playwrights
do not satisfy them, because they cannot believe
in them; and belief that the horror or scandal actually
occurred, that real people are shedding real blood and
real tears, is indispensable to their enjoyment. To proxiiduce
this belief by works of fiction, the writer must disguise
and even discard the arts of the man of letters and
assume the style of the descriptive reporter of the criminal
courts. As an example of how to cater for such readers,
we may take Zola’s Bête Humaine. It is in all its essentials
a simple and touching story, like Prévost’s Manon
Lescaut. But into it Zola has violently thrust the greatest
police sensation of the XIX century: the episode of
Jack the Ripper. Jack’s hideous neurosis is no more a
part of human nature than Cæsar’s epilepsy or Gladstone’s
missing finger. One is tempted to accuse Zola of
having borrowed it from the newspapers to please his
customers just as Shakespear used to borrow stories of
murder and jealousy from the tales and chronicles of his
time, and heap them on the head of convivial humorists
like Iago and Richard III, or gentle poets like Macbeth
and Hamlet. Without such allurements, Shakespear
could not have lived by his plays. And if he had been rich
enough to disregard this consideration, he would still
have had to provide sensation enough to induce people to
listen to what he was inspired to say. It is only the man
who has no message who is too fastidious to beat the drum
at the door of his booth.

Rise of the Scientific Spirit.

Still, the Shakesperean murders were romantic murders:
the Zolaesque ones were police reports. The old
mad heroines, the Ophelias and Lucies of Lammermoor,
were rhapsodists with flowers in their hands: the new
ones were clinical studies of mental disease. The new
note was as conspicuous in the sensational chapters as in
the dull chapters, of which there were many. This was
the punishment of the middle class for hypocrisy. It had
carried the conspiracy of silence which we call decorum
to such lengths that when young men discovered the
suppressed truths, they felt bound to shout them in the
streets. I well remember how when I was a youth in myxiii
teens I happened to obtain access to the papers of an
Irish crown solicitor through a colleague who had some
clerical work to do upon them. The county concerned
was not one of the crimeless counties: there was a large
camp in it; and the soldier of that day was not the respectable,
rather pious, and very low-spirited youth who
now makes the King’s uniform what the curate’s black
coat was then. There were not only cases which were
tried and not reported: there were cases which could not
even be tried, the offenders having secured impunity by
pushing their follies to lengths too grotesque to be bearable
even in a criminal court—also because of the silly
ferocity of the law, which punished the negligible indecencies
of drunken young soldiers as atrocious crimes.
The effect produced by these revelations on my raw
youth was a sense of heavy responsibility for conniving
at their concealment. I felt that if camp and barrack life
involved these things, they ought to be known. I had
been caught by the great wave of scientific enthusiasm
which was then passing over Europe as a result of the
discovery of Natural Selection by Darwin, and of the blow
it dealt to the vulgar Bible worship and redemption mongering
which had hitherto passed among us for religion. I
wanted to get at the facts. I was prepared for the facts
being unflattering: had I not already faced the fact that
instead of being a fallen angel I was first cousin to a monkey?
Long afterwards, when I was a well-known writer,
I said that what we wanted as the basis of our plays and
novels was not romance, but a really scientific natural
history. Scientific natural history is not compatible with
taboo; and as everything connected with sex was tabooed,
I felt the need for mentioning the forbidden subjects,
not only because of their own importance, but for the
sake of destroying taboo by giving it the most violent
possible shocks. The same impulse is unmistakeably active
in Zola and his contemporaries. He also wanted, not
works of literary art, but stories he could believe in as rexivcords
of things that really happen. He imposed Jack the
Ripper on his idyll of the railwayman’s wife to make it
scientific. To all artists and Platonists he made it thereby
very unreal; for to the Platonist all accidents are unreal
and negligible; but to the people he wanted to get
at—the anti-artistic people—he made it readable.

The scientific spirit was unintelligible to the Philistines
and repulsive to the dilettanti, who said to Zola: ‘If you
must tell us stories about agricultural laborers, why tell us
dirty ones?’ But Zola did not want, like the old romancers,
to tell a story. He wanted to tell the world the scientific
truth about itself. His view was that if you were going to
legislate for agricultural laborers, or deal with them or
their business in any way, you had better know what they
are really like; and in supplying you with the necessary
information he did not tell you what you already knew,
which included pretty nearly all that could be decorously
mentioned, but what you did not know, which was that
part of the truth that was tabooed. For the same reason,
when he found a generation whose literary notions of
Parisian cocotterie were founded on Marguerite Gauthier,
he felt it to be a duty to shew them Nana. And it was
a very necessary thing to do. If some Irish writer of the
seventies had got himself banished from all decent society,
and perhaps convicted of obscene libel, by writing a
novel shewing the side of camp life that was never mentioned
except in the papers of the Crown Solicitor, we
should be nearer to a rational military system than we are
today.

Zolaism as a Superstition.

It is, unfortunately, much easier to throw the forces of
art into a reaction than to recall them when the reaction
has gone far enough. A case which came under my own
notice years ago illustrates the difficulty. The wife of an
eminent surgeon had some talent for drawing. Her husband
wrote a treatise on cancer; and she drew the illusxvtrations.
It was the first time she had used her gift for a
serious purpose; and she worked hard enough at it to
acquire considerable skill in depicting cancerous proliferation.
The book being finished and published, she
resumed her ordinary practice of sketching for pleasure.
But all her work now had an uncanny look. When she
drew a landscape, it was like a cancer that accidentally
looked like a landscape. She had acquired a cancerous
technique; and she could not get rid of it.

This happens as easily in literature as in the other arts.
The men who trained themselves as writers by dragging
the unmentionable to light, presently found that they
could do that so much better than anything else that they
gave up dealing with the other subjects. Even their quite
mentionable episodes had an unmentionable air. Their
imitators assumed that unmentionability was an end in
itself—that to be decent was to be out of the movement.
Zola and Ibsen could not, of course, be confined to mere
reaction against taboo. Ibsen was to the last fascinating
and full of a strange moving beauty; and Zola often broke
into sentimental romance. But neither Ibsen nor Zola,
after they once took in hand the work of unmasking the
idols of the bourgeoisie, ever again wrote a happy or pleasant
play or novel. Ibsen’s suicides and catastrophes at last
produced the cry of ‘People don’t do such things,’ which
he ridiculed through Judge Brack in Hedda Gabler. This
was easy enough: Brack was so far wrong that people do
do such things occasionally. But on the whole Brack was
right. The tragedy of Hedda in real life is not that she
commits suicide but that she continues to live. If such
acts of violent rebellion as those of Hedda and Nora and
Rebecca and the rest were the inevitable or even the probable
consequences of their unfitness to be wives and
mothers, or of their contracting repugnant marriages to
avoid being left on the shelf, social reform would be very
rapid; and we should hear less nonsense as to women like
Nora and Hedda being mere figments of Ibsen’s imaginxviation.
Our real difficulty is the almost boundless docility
and submission to social convention which is characteristic
of the human race. What baulks the social reformer
everywhere is that the victims of social evils do not complain,
and even strongly resent being treated as victims.
The more a dog suffers from being chained the more dangerous
it is to release him: he bites savagely at the hand
that dares touch his collar. Our Rougon-Macquart families
are usually enormously proud of themselves; and
though they have to put up with their share of drunkards
and madmen, they do not proliferate into Jack-the-Rippers.
Nothing that is admittedly and unmistakeably horrible
matters very much, because it frightens people into
seeking a remedy: the serious horrors are those which
seem entirely respectable and normal to respectable and
normal men. Now the formula of tragedy had come down
to the nineteenth century from days in which this was not
recognized, and when life was so thoroughly accepted as
a divine institution that in order to make it seem tragic,
something dreadful had to happen and somebody had to
die. But the tragedy of modern life is that nothing happens,
and that the resultant dulness does not kill. Maupassant’s
Une Vie is infinitely more tragic than the death
of Juliet.

In Ibsen’s works we find the old traditions and the
new conditions struggling in the same play, like a gudgeon
half swallowed by a pike. Almost all the sorrow
and the weariness which makes his plays so poignant are
the sorrow and weariness of the mean dull life in which
nothing happens; but none the less he provides a final
catastrophe of the approved fifth-act-blank-verse type.
Hedwig and Hedda shoot themselves: Rosmer and Rebecca
throw themselves into the mill-race: Solness and
Rubeck are dashed to pieces: Borkman dies of acute stage
tragedy without discoverable lesions. I will not again say,
as I have said before, that these catastrophes are forced,
because a fortunate performance often makes them seemxvii
inevitable; but I do submit that the omission of them
would leave the play sadder and more convincing.

The Passing of the Tragic Catastrophe and
the Happy Ending.

Not only is the tradition of the catastrophe unsuitable
to modern studies of life: the tradition of an ending,
happy or the reverse, is equally unworkable. The moment
the dramatist gives up accidents and catastrophes,
and takes ‘slices of life’ as his material, he finds himself
committed to plays that have no endings. The curtain no
longer comes down on a hero slain or married: it comes
down when the audience has seen enough of the life presented
to it to draw the moral, and must either leave the
theatre or miss its last train.

The man who faced France with a drama fulfilling all
these conditions was Brieux. He was as scientific, as conscientious,
as unflinching as Zola without being in the
least morbid. He was no more dependent on horrors than
Molière, and as sane in his temper. He threw over the
traditional forced catastrophe uncompromisingly. You
do not go away from a Brieux play with the feeling that
the affair is finished or the problem solved for you by the
dramatist. Still less do you go away in ‘that happy, easy,
ironically indulgent frame of mind that is the true test of
comedy’, as Mr. Walkley put it in The Times of the 1st
October 1909. You come away with a very disquieting
sense that you are involved in the affair, and must find the
way out of it for yourself and everybody else if civilization
is to be tolerable to your sense of honor.

The Difference between Brieux and Molière or
Shakespear.

Brieux’s task is thus larger than Molière’s. Molière destroyed
the prestige of those conspiracies against society
which we call the professions, and which thrive by the exploitation
of idolatry. He unmasked the doctor, the philoxviiisopher,
the fencing master, the priest. He ridiculed their
dupes: the hypochondriac, the academician, the devotee,
the gentleman in search of accomplishments. He exposed
the snob: he shewed the gentleman as the butt and creature
of his valet, emphasizing thus the inevitable relation
between the man who lives by unearned money and
the man who lives by weight of service. Beyond bringing
this latter point up to a later date Beaumarchais did
nothing. But Molière never indicted society. Burke said
that you cannot bring an indictment against a nation; yet
within a generation from that utterance men began to
draw indictments against whole epochs, especially against
the capitalistic epoch. It is true that Molière, like Shakespear,
indicted human nature, which would seem to be a
broader attack; but such attacks only make thoughtful
men melancholy and hopeless, and practical men cynical
or murderous. Le Misanthrope, which seems to me, as a
foreigner perhaps, to be Molière’s dullest and worst play,
is like Hamlet in two respects. The first, which is that it
would have been much better if it had been written in
prose, is merely technical and need not detain us. The
second is that the author does not clearly know what he
is driving at. Le Festin de Pierre, Molière’s best philosophic
play, is as brilliant and arresting as Le Misanthrope
is neither the one nor the other; but here again there is
no positive side: the statue is a hollow creature with nothing
to say for himself; and Don Juan makes no attempt
to take advantage of his weakness. The reason why
Shakespear and Molière are always well spoken of and
recommended to the young is that their quarrel is really a
quarrel with God for not making men better. If they had
quarrelled with a specified class of persons with incomes
of four figures for not doing their work better, or for doing
no work at all, they would be denounced as seditious,
impious, and profligate corruptors of morality.

Brieux wastes neither ink nor indignation on Providence.
The idle despair that shakes its fist impotently atxix
the skies, uttering sublime blasphemies, such as




‘As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods:
They kill us for their sport,’


does not amuse Brieux. His fisticuffs are not aimed heavenward:
they fall on human noses for the good of human
souls. When he sees human nature in conflict with a political
abuse he does not blame human nature, knowing
that such blame is the favorite trick of those who wish to
perpetuate the abuse without being able to defend it. He
does not even blame the abuse: he exposes it, and then
leaves human nature to tackle it with its eyes open. And
his method of exposure is the dramatic method. He is a
born dramatist, differing from the ordinary dramatists
only in that he has a large mind and a scientific habit of
using it. As a dramatist he must take for his theme a conflict
of some sort. As a dramatist of large mind he cannot
be satisfied with the trumpery conflicts of the Divorce
Court and the Criminal Court: of the husband with the
seducer, of the policeman with the murderer. Having
the scientific conscience in a higher degree than Zola (he
has a better head), he cannot be interested in imaginary
conflicts which he himself would have to invent
like a child at play. The conflict which inspires his dramatic
genius must be a big one and a real one. To ask an
audience to spend three hours hanging on the question
of which particular man some particular woman shall
mate with does not strike him as a reasonable proceeding;
and if the audience does not agree with him, why,
it can go to some fashionable dramatist of the boulevard
who does agree with it.

Brieux and the Boulevard.

This involves Brieux in furious conflict with the boulevard.
Up to quite recent times it was impossible for an
Englishman to mention Brieux to a Parisian as the only
French playwright who really counted in Europe without
being met with astonished assurances that Brieux isxx
not a playwright at all; that his plays are not plays; that
he is not (in Sarcey’s sense of the phrase) ‘du théâtre’;
that he is a mere pamphleteer without even literary style.
And when you expressed your natural gratification at
learning that the general body of Parisian dramatists
were so highly gifted that Brieux counted for nothing
in Paris—when you respectfully asked for the names of
a few of the most prominent of the geniuses who had
eclipsed him, you were given three or four of which you
had never heard, and one or two known to you as those of
cynically commercial manipulators of the menage à trois,
the innocent wife discovered at the villain’s rooms at
midnight (to beg him to spare the virtue of a sister, the
character of a son, or the life of a father), the compromising
letter, the duel, and all the rest of the claptraps out of
which dramatic playthings can be manufactured for the
amusement of grown-up children. Not until the Academie
Française elected Brieux did it occur to the boulevardiers
that the enormous difference between him and
their pet authors was a difference in which the superiority
lay with Brieux.

The Pedantry of Paris.

Indeed it is difficult for the Englishman to understand
how bigotedly the Parisians cling to the claptrap theatre.
The English do not care enough about the theatre to
cling to its traditions or persecute anyone for their sake;
but the French do. Besides, in fine art, France is a nation
of born pedants. The vulgar English painter paints vulgar
pictures, and generally sells them. But the vulgar
French painter paints classical ones, though whether he
sells them or not I do not know: I hope not. The corresponding
infatuation in the theatre is for dramas in alexandrines;
and alexandrines are far worse than English
blank verse, which is saying a good deal. Racine and
Corneille, who established the alexandrine tradition, deliberately
aimed at classicism, taking the Greek dramaxxi
as their model. Even a foreigner can hear the music of
their verse. Corneille wrote alexandrines as Dryden wrote
heroic couplets, in a virile, stately, handsome and withal
human way; and Racine had tenderness and beauty as
well. This drama of Racine and Corneille, with the music
of Gluck, gave the French in the XVII and XVIII centuries
a body of art which was very beautiful, very refined,
very delightful for cultivated people, and very tedious
for the ignorant. When, through the spread of
elementary education, the ignorant invaded the theatre
in overwhelming numbers, this exquisite body of art became
a dead body, and was practised by nobody except
the amateurs—the people who love what has been already
done in art and loathe the real life out of which
living art must continually grow afresh. In their hands
it passed from being a commercial failure to being an obsolete
nuisance.

Commercially, the classic play was supplanted by a
nuisance which was not a failure: to wit, the ‘well made
play’ of Scribe and his school. The manufacture of well
made plays is not an art: it is an industry. It is not
at all hard for a literary mechanic to acquire it: the
only difficulty is to find a literary mechanic who is not
by nature too much of an artist for the job; for nothing
spoils a well made play more infallibly than the least alloy
of high art or the least qualm of conscience on the
part of the writer. ‘Art for art’s sake’ is the formula of
the well made play, meaning in practice ‘Success for
money’s sake.’ Now great art is never produced for its
own sake. It is too difficult to be worth the effort. All
the great artists enter into a terrible struggle with the
public, often involving bitter poverty and personal humiliation,
and always involving calumny and persecution,
because they believe they are apostles doing what
used to be called the Will of God, and is now called by
many prosaic names, of which ‘public work’ is the least
controversial. And when these artists have travailed andxxii
brought forth, and at last forced the public to associate
keen pleasure and deep interest with their methods and
morals, a crowd of smaller men—art confectioners, we
may call them—hasten to make pretty entertainments
out of scraps and crumbs from the masterpieces. Offenbach
laid hands on Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony and
produced J’aime les militaires, to the disgust of Schumann,
who was nevertheless doing precisely the same
thing in a more pretentious way. And these confectioners
are by no means mere plagiarists. They bring all sorts
of engaging qualities to their work: love of beauty, desire
to give pleasure, tenderness, humor, everything except
the high republican conscience, the identification of
the artist’s purpose with the purpose of the universe,
which alone makes an artist great.

But the well made play was not confectionery: it had
not even the derived virtue of being borrowed from the
great playwrights. Its formula grew up in the days when
the spread of elementary schooling produced a huge mass
of playgoers sufficiently educated to want plays instead
of dog-fights, but not educated enough to enjoy or understand
the masterpieces of dramatic art. Besides, education
or no education, one cannot live on masterpieces
alone, not only because there are not enough of them, but
because new plays as well as great plays are needed, and
there are not enough Molières and Shakespears in the
world to keep the demand for novelty satisfied. Hence it
has always been necessary to have some formula by which
men of mediocre talent and no conscience can turn out
plays for the theatrical market. Such men have written
melodramas since the theatre existed. It was in the XIX
century that the demand for manufactured plays was
extended to drawing room plays in which the Forest of
Bondy and the Auberge des Adrets, the Red Barn and the
Cave at Midnight, had to be replaced by Lord Blank’s
flat in Whitehall Court and the Great Hall, Chevy Chace.
Playgoers, being by that time mostly poor playgoers,xxiii
wanted to see how the rich live; wanted to see them actually
drinking champagne and wearing real fashionable
dresses and trousers with a neatly ironed crease down the
knee.

How to Write a Popular Play.

The formula for the well made play is so easy that I give
it for the benefit of any reader who feels tempted to try
his hand at making the fortune that awaits all successful
manufacturers in this line. First, you ‘have an idea’ for a
dramatic situation. If it strikes you as a splendidly original
idea whilst it is in fact as old as the hills, so much the
better. For instance, the situation of an innocent person
convicted by circumstances of a crime may always be depended
on. If the person is a woman, she must be convicted
of adultery. If a young officer, he must be convicted
of selling information to the enemy, though it is
really a fascinating female spy who has ensnared him and
stolen the incriminating document. If the innocent wife,
banished from her home, suffers agonies through her separation
from her children, and, when one of them is dying
(of any disease the dramatist chooses to inflict), disguises
herself as a nurse and attends it through its dying convulsion
until the doctor, who should be a serio-comic character,
and if possible a faithful old admirer of the lady’s,
simultaneously announces the recovery of the child and
the discovery of the wife’s innocence, the success of the
play may be regarded as assured if the writer has any sort
of knack for his work. Comedy is more difficult, because
it requires a sense of humor and a good deal of vivacity;
but the process is essentially the same: it is the manufacture
of a misunderstanding. Having manufactured it,
you place its culmination at the end of the last act but one,
which is the point at which the manufacture of the play
begins. Then you make your first act out of the necessary
introduction of the characters to the audience, after
elaborate explanations, mostly conducted by servants,xxiv
solicitors, and other low life personages (the principals
must all be dukes and colonels and millionaires), of how
the misunderstanding is going to come about. Your last
act consists, of course, of clearing up the misunderstanding,
and generally getting the audience out of the theatre
as best you can.

Now please do not misunderstand me as pretending
that this process is so mechanical that it offers no opportunity
for the exercise of talent. On the contrary, it is so
mechanical that without very conspicuous talent nobody
can make much reputation by doing it, though some
can and do make a living at it. And this often leads the
cultivated classes to suppose that all plays are written by
authors of talent. As a matter of fact the majority of those
who in France and England make a living by writing
plays are unknown and, as to education, all but illiterate.
Their names are not worth putting on the playbill, because
their audiences neither know nor care who the author
is, and often believe that the actors improvise the
whole piece, just as they in fact do sometimes improvise
the dialogue. To rise out of this obscurity you must be
a Scribe or a Sardou, doing essentially the same thing, it
is true, but doing it wittily and ingeniously, at moments
almost poetically, and giving the persons of the drama
some touches of real observed character.

Why the Critics are always Wrong.

Now it is these strokes of talent that set the critics
wrong. For the talent, being all expended on the formula,
at last consecrates the formula in the the eyes of the
critics. Nay, they become so accustomed to the formula
that at last they cannot relish or understand a play that
has grown naturally, just as they cannot admire the Venus
of Milo because she has neither a corset nor high heeled
shoes. They are like the peasants who are so accustomed
to food reeking with garlic that when food is served to
them without it they declare that it has no taste and is not
food at all.

xxv

This is the explanation of the refusal of the critics of all
nations to accept great original dramatists like Ibsen and
Brieux as real dramatists, or their plays as real plays. No
writer of the first order needs the formula any more than
a sound man needs a crutch. In his simplest mood, when
he is only seeking to amuse, he does not manufacture a
plot: he tells a story. He finds no difficulty in setting people
on the stage to talk and act in an amusing, exciting or
touching way. His characters have adventures and ideas
which are interesting in themselves, and need not be fitted
into the Chinese puzzle of a plot.

The Interpreter of Life.

But the great dramatist has something better to do
than to amuse either himself or his audience. He has to
interpret life. This sounds a mere pious phrase of literary
criticism; but a moment’s consideration will discover its
meaning and its exactitude. Life as it appears to us in our
daily experience is an unintelligible chaos of happenings.
You pass Othello in the bazaar in Aleppo, Iago on the
jetty in Cyprus, and Desdemona in the nave of St. Mark’s
in Venice without the slightest clue to their relations to
one another. The man you see stepping into a chemist’s
shop to buy the means of committing murder or suicide,
may, for all you know, want nothing but a liver pill or a
toothbrush. The statesman who has no other object than
to make you vote for his party at the next election may
be starting you on an incline at the foot of which lies war,
or revolution, or a smallpox epidemic, or five years off
your lifetime. The horrible murder of a whole family by
the father who finishes by killing himself, or the driving
of a young girl on to the streets, may be the result of your
discharging an employee in a fit of temper a month before.
To attempt to understand life from merely looking
on at it as it happens in the streets is as hopeless as trying
to understand public questions by studying snapshots of
public demonstrations. If we possessed a series of cinexxvimatographs
of all the executions during the Reign of
Terror, they might be exhibited a thousand times without
enlightening the audiences in the least as to the
meaning of the Revolution: Robespierre would perish as
‘un monsieur’ and Marie Antoinette as ‘une femme.’
Life as it occurs is senseless: a policeman may watch it
and work in it for thirty years in the streets and courts of
Paris without learning as much of it or from it as a child
or a nun may learn from a single play by Brieux. For it
is the business of Brieux to pick out the significant incidents
from the chaos of daily happenings, and arrange
them so that their relation to one another becomes significant,
thus changing us from bewildered spectators of
a monstrous confusion to men intelligently conscious of
the world and its destinies. This is the highest function
that man can perform—the greatest work he can set his
hand to; and this is why the great dramatists of the world,
from Euripides and Aristophanes to Shakespear and Molière,
and from them to Ibsen and Brieux, take that majestic
and pontifical rank which seems so strangely above
all the reasonable pretensions of mere strolling actors and
theatrical authors.

How the Great Dramatists torture the Public.

Now if the critics are wrong in supposing that the formula
of the well made play is not only an indispensable
factor in playwriting, but is actually the essence of the
play itself—if their delusion is rebuked and confuted by
the practice of every great dramatist even when he is
only amusing himself by story telling, what must happen
to their poor formula when it impertinently offers its
services to a playwright who has taken on his supreme
function as the Interpreter of Life? Not only has he no
use for it; but he must attack and destroy it; for one of
the very first lessons he has to teach to a play-ridden
public is that the romantic conventions on which the
formula proceeds are all false, and are doing incalculablexxvii
harm in these days when everybody reads romances and
goes to the theatre. Just as the historian can teach no
real history until he has cured his readers of the romantic
delusion that the greatness of a queen consists in her
being a pretty woman and having her head cut off; so
the playwright of the first order can do nothing with his
audiences until he has cured them of looking at the stage
through the keyhole and sniffing round the theatre as
prurient people sniff round the divorce court. The cure
is not a popular one. The public suffers from it exactly as
a drunkard or a snuff taker suffers from an attempt to
conquer the habit. The critics especially, who are forced
by their profession to indulge immoderately in plays adulterated
with falsehood and vice, suffer so acutely
when deprived of them for a whole evening that they
hurl disparagements and even abuse and insult at the
merciless dramatist who is torturing them. To a bad play
of the kind they are accustomed to they can be cruel
through superciliousness, irony, impatience, contempt,
or even a Rochefoucauldian pleasure in a friend’s misfortune.
But the hatred provoked by deliberately inflicted
pain, the frantic denials as of a prisoner at the bar
accused of a disgraceful crime, the clamor for vengeance
thinly disguised as artistic justice, the suspicion that the
dramatist is using private information and making a personal
attack: all these are to be found only when the
playwright is no mere marchand de plaisir, but, like
Brieux, a ruthless revealer of hidden truth and a mighty
destroyer of idols.

Brieux’s Conquest of London.

So well does Brieux know this that he has written a
play, La Foi, showing how truth is terrible to men, and
how false religions (theatrical romance, by the way, is
the falsest and most fantastically held of all the false religions)
are a necessity to them. With this play he
achieved, for the first time on record, the feat of winningxxviii
a success in a fashionable London theatre with a cold-blooded
thesis play. Those who witnessed the performance
of False Gods at His Majesty’s Theatre this year
were astonished to see that exceptionally large theatre
filled with strangely attentive ordinary playgoers, to
whose customary requirements and weaknesses no concession
was made for a moment by the playwright. They
were getting a lesson and nothing else. The same famous
acting, the same sumptuous mise en scène, had not always
saved other plays from failure. There was no enthusiasm:
one might almost say there was no enjoyment. The audience
for once had something better to do than to amuse
themselves. The old playgoers and the critics, who, on
the first night, had politely regretted an inevitable failure
after waiting, like the maturer ladies at the sack of Ismail
in Byron’s poem, for the adultery to begin, asked
one another incredulously whether there could really be
money in this sort of thing. Such feats had been performed
before at coterie theatres where the expenses
were low and where the plays were seasoned with a good
deal of ordinary amusing comedy; but in this play there
was not a jest from beginning to end; and the size of the
theatre and the expenses of production were on a princely
scale. Yet La Foi held its own. The feat was quite unprecedented;
and that it should have been achieved for the
first time by a Frenchman is about a million times more
remarkable than that the first man to fly across the channel
(the two events were almost simultaneous) should also
have been a Frenchman.

Parisian Stupidity.

And here I must digress for a moment to remark that
though Paris is easily the most prejudiced, old-fashioned,
obsolete-minded city in the west of Europe, yet when she
produces great men she certainly does not do it by halves.
Unfortunately, there is nothing she hates more than a
Frenchman of genius. When an Englishman says thatxxix
you have to go back to Michael Angelo to find a sculptor
who can be mentioned in the same breath as Rodin without
manifest absurdity, the Parisians indignantly exclaim
that only an ignorant foreigner could imagine that a man
who was not a pupil at the Beaux Arts could possibly be
a sculptor at all. And I have already described how they
talk about Brieux, the only French dramatist whose
fame crosses frontiers and channels, and fills the continent.
To be quite frank, I cannot to this day understand
why they made him an Academician instead of starving
him to death and then giving him a statue. Can it be
that in his early days, before he could gain his living by
the theatre, he wrote a spelling book, or delivered a
course of lectures on the use of pure line in Greek design?
To suppose that they did it because he is a great man is
to imply that they know a great Frenchman when they
see him, which is contrary to all experience. They never
know until the English tell them.

Brieux and the English Theatre.

In England our knowledge of Brieux has been delayed
by the childishness of our theatre. This childishness is
by no means to be deplored: it means that the theatre is
occupied with the elementary education of the masses
instead of with the higher education of the classes. Those
who desire dramatic performances of the higher sort have
procured them only by forming clubs, hiring theatres,
engaging performers, and selecting plays for themselves.
After 1889, when Ibsen first became known in
London through A Doll’s House, a succession of these
clubs kept what may be called the serious adult drama
fitfully alive until 1904, when Messrs. Vedrenne and
Barker took the field with a regular theatrical enterprise
devoted to this class of work, and maintained it until
the National Theatre project was set on foot, and provisional
repertory schemes were announced by established
commercial managements. It was through one of thesexxx
clubs, the Stage Society, that Brieux reached the English
stage with his Bienfaiteurs. Then the first two plays in
this volume were performed, and, later on, Les Hannetons.
These performances settled for English connoisseurs
the question of Brieux’s rank among modern
playwrights. Later on his Robe Rouge introduced the
ordinary playgoers to him; and he is now no longer one
of the curiosities of the coterie theatre, as even Ibsen to
some extent still is, but one of the conquerors of the
general British public.

The Censorship in France and England.

Unfortunately, he has not yet been able to conquer
our detestable, discredited, but still all-powerful censorship.
In France he was attacked by the censorship just as
in England; but in France the censorship broke itself
against him and perished. The same thing would probably
have occurred here but for the fact that our Censor,
by a grotesque accident of history—to be precise, because
Henry VIII. began the censorship of the theatre
by appointing an officer of his own household to do the
work—remains part of the King’s retinue; and his abolition
involves the curtailment of that retinue and therefore
the reduction of the King’s State, always a very difficult
and delicate matter in a monarchical country. In
France the censorship was exercised by the Minister of
Fine Arts (a portfolio that does not exist in our Cabinet)
and was in the hands of two or three examiners of
plays, who necessarily behaved exactly like our Mr. Redford;
for, as I have so often pointed out, the evils of censorship
are made compulsory by the nature of the office,
and are not really the fault of the individual censor.
These gentlemen, then, prohibited the performance of
Brieux’s best and most useful plays just as Mr. Redford
did here. But as the French Parliament, having nobody
to consider but themselves and the interests of the nation,
presently refused to vote the salaries of the Censors, thexxxi
institution died a natural death. We have no such summary
remedy here. Our Censor’s salary is part of the
King’s civil list, and is therefore sacred. Years ago, our
Playgoers’ Club asked me how the censorship could be
abolished. I replied, to the great scandal of that loyal
body: You must begin by abolishing the monarchy.

Brieux and the English Censorship.

Nevertheless, Brieux has left his mark even on the
English censorship. This year (1909) the prohibition of
his plays was one of the strongest items in the long list of
grievances by which the English playwrights compelled
the Government to appoint a Select Committee of both
houses of Parliament to enquire into the working of the
censorship. The report of that Committee admits the
charge brought against the Censor of systematically suppressing
plays dealing seriously with social problems
whilst allowing frivolous and even pornographic plays to
pass unchallenged. It advises that the submission of plays
to the Censor shall in future be optional, though it does
not dare to omit the customary sycophantic recommendation
that the Lord Chamberlain shall still retain his
privilege of licensing plays; and it proposes that the
authors and managers of plays so licensed, though not
exempt from prosecution, shall enjoy certain immunities
denied in the case of unlicensed plays. There are many
other conditions which need not be gone into here; but
to a Frenchman the main fact that stands out is that the
accident which has made the Censor an officer of the
King’s Household has prevented a parliamentary committee
from recommending the abolition of his control
over the theatre in a report which not only has not a word
to say in his defence, but expressly declares that his license
affords the public no guarantee that the plays he approves
are decent, and that authors of serious plays need protection
against his unenlightened despotism.

xxxii

Taboo.

We may therefore take it on the authority of the Select
Committee that the prohibition by the English censorship
of the public performances of the three plays in
this book does not afford the smallest reasonable ground
for condemning them as improper—rather the contrary.
As a matter of fact, most men, if asked to guess the passages
to which the Censor took exception, would guess
wrongly. Certainly a Frenchman would. The reason is
that though in England as in France what is called decency
is not a reasoned discrimination between what
needs to be said and what ought not to be said, but simply
the observance of a set of taboos, these taboos are not the
same in England as in France. A Frenchman of scrupulously
correct behavior will sometimes quite innocently
make an English lady blush by mentioning something
that is unmentionable in polite society in England though
quite mentionable in France. To take a simple illustration,
an Englishman, when he first visits France, is always
embarrassed, and sometimes shocked, on finding that the
person in charge of a public lavatory for men is a woman.
I cannot give reciprocal instances of the ways in which
Englishmen shock the French nation, because I am happily
unconscious of all the cochonneries of which I am no
doubt guilty when I am in France. But that I do occasionally
shock the brave French bourgeois to the very
marrow of his bones by my indelicacy, I have not the
smallest doubt. There is only one epithet in universal
use for foreigners. That epithet is ‘dirty.’

The Attitude of the People to the Literary Arts.

These differences between nation and nation also exist
between class and class and between town and country. I
will not here go into the vexed question of whether the
peasant’s way of blowing his nose or the squire’s is thexxxiii
more cleanly and hygienic, though my experience as a
municipal councillor of the way in which epidemics are
spread by laundries makes me incline to the side of the
peasant. What is beyond all question is that each seems
disgusting to the other. And when we come from physical
facts to moral views and ethical opinions we find the
same antagonisms. To a great section—perhaps the largest
section—of the people of England and France, all
novels, plays, and songs are licentious; and the habit of
enjoying them is a mark of a worthless character. To
these people the distinctions made by the literary classes
between books fit for young girls to read and improper
books—between Paul and Virginia and Mademoiselle de
Maupin or Une Vie, between Mrs. Humphry Ward and
Ouida—have no meaning: all writers of love stories and
all readers of them are alike shameless. Cultivated Paris,
cultivated London, are apt to overlook people who, as
they seldom read and never write, have no means of making
themselves heard. But such simple people heavily
outnumber the cultivated; and if they could also outwit
them, literature would perish. Yet their intolerance of
fiction is as nothing to their intolerance of fact. I lately
heard an English gentleman state a very simple fact in
these terms: ‘I never could get on with my mother:
she did not like me; and I did not like her: my brother
was her pet.’ To an immense number of living English
and French people this speech would suggest that its
utterer ought to be burned alive, though the substitution
of stepmother for mother and of half-brother for brother
would suffice to make it seem quite probable and natural.
And this, observe, not in the least because all these horrified
people adore and are adored by their mothers, but
simply because they have a fixed convention that the
proper name of the relation between mother and son is
love. However bitter and hostile it may in fact be in some
cases, to call it by any other name is a breach of convention;
and by the instinctive logic of timidity they inferxxxiv
that a man to whom convention is not sacred is a dangerous
man. To them the ten commandments are nothing
but arbitrary conventions; and the man who says today
that he does not love his mother may, they conclude, tomorrow
steal, rob, murder, commit adultery, and bear
false witness against his neighbor.

The Dread of the Original Thinker.

This is the real secret of the terror inspired by an original
thinker. In repudiating convention he is repudiating
that on which his neighbors are relying for their sense
of security. But he is usually also doing something even
more unpopular. He is proposing new obligations to add
to the already heavy burden of duty. When the boy Shelley
elaborately and solemnly cursed his father for the entertainment
of his friends, he only shocked us. But when
the man Shelley told us that we should feed, clothe and
educate all the children in the country as carefully as if
they were our immediate own, we lost our tempers with
him and deprived him of the custody of his own children.

It is useless to complain that the conventional masses
are unintelligent. To begin with, they are not unintelligent
except in the sense in which all men are unintelligent
in matters in which they are not experts. I object
to be called unintelligent merely because I do not know
enough about mechanical construction to be able to judge
whether a motor car of new design is an improvement
or not, and therefore prefer to buy one of the old type
to which I am accustomed. The brave bourgeois whom
Brieux scandalizes must not be dismissed with ridicule
by the man of letters because, not being an expert in
morals, he prefers the old ways and mistrusts the new.
His position is a very reasonable one. He says, in effect,
‘If I am to enjoy any sense of security, I must be able
to reckon on other people behaving in a certain ascertained
way. Never mind whether it is the ideally right
way or the ideally wrong way: it will suit me well enoughxxxv
if only it is convenient and, above all, unmistakeable. Lay
it down if you like that people are not to pay debts and
are to murder one another whenever they get a chance.
In that case I can refuse to give credit and can carry weapons
and learn to use them to defend myself. On the
other hand, if you settle that debts are to be enforced
and the peace kept by the police, I will give credit and
renounce the practice of arms. But the one thing that I
cannot stand is not knowing what the social contract is.’

The Justification of Conventionality.

It is a cherished tradition in English politics that at a
meeting of Lord Melbourne’s Cabinet in the early days
of Queen Victoria, the Prime Minister, when the meeting
threatened to break up in confusion, put his back to
the door and said, in the cynically profane manner then
fashionable: ‘Gentlemen: we can tell the House the
truth or we can tell it a lie: I do not care a damn which.
All I insist on is that we shall all tell the same lie; and
you shall not leave the room until you have settled what
it is to be.’ Just so does the bourgeois perceive that the
essential thing is not whether a convention is right or
wrong, but that everybody shall know what it is and observe
it. His cry is always: ‘I want to know where I
stand.’ Tell him what he may do and what he may not
do; and make him feel that he may depend on other
people doing or not doing the same; and he feels secure,
knowing where he stands and where other people
stand. His dread and hatred of revolutions and heresies
and men with original ideas is his dread of disorientation
and insecurity. Those who have felt earthquakes
assure us that there is no terror like the terror of the
earth swaying under the feet that have always depended
on it as the one immovable thing in the world. That is
just how the ordinary respectable man feels when some
man of genius rocks the moral ground beneath him by
denying the validity of a convention. The popularxxxvi
phrases by which such innovators are described are always
of the same kind. The early Christians were called
men who wished to turn the world upside down. The
modern critics of morals are reproached for ‘standing
on their heads.’ There is no pretence of argument, or
of any understanding of the proposals of the reformers:
there is simply panic and a demand for suppression at
all costs. The reformer is not forbidden to advance this
or that definite opinion, because his assailants are too
frightened to know or care what his opinions are: he
is forbidden simply to speak in an unusual way about
morals and religion, or to mention any subject that is not
usually mentioned in public.

This is the terror which the English censorship, like
all other censorships, gives effect to. It explains what puzzles
most observers of the censorship so much: namely,
its scandalous laxity towards and positive encouragement
of the familiar and customary pornographic side of theatrical
art simultaneously with its intolerance of the higher
drama, which is always unconventional and super-bourgeois
in its ethics. To illustrate, let me cite the point on
which the English censorship came into conflict with
Brieux, when Les Hannetons was first performed by the
Stage Society.

Why Les Hannetons was Censored.

Les Hannetons is a very powerful and convincing demonstration
of the delusiveness of that sort of freedom
which men try to secure by refusing to marry, and living
with a mistress instead. The play is a comedy: the audience
laughs throughout; but the most dissolute man present
leaves the theatre convinced that the unfortunate
hero had better have been married ten times over than
fallen into such bondage as his liaison has landed him in.
To witness a performance might very wisely be made part
of the curriculum of every university college and polytechnic
in the country.

xxxvii

Now those who do not know the ways of the censorship
may jump to the conclusion that the objection of the Censor
was to the exhibition on the stage of two persons living
together in immoral relations. They would be greatly
mistaken. The censor made no difficulty whatever about
that. Even the funny but ruthless scene where the woman
cajoles the man by kissing him on a certain susceptible
spot on his neck—a scene from which our shamed
conscience shrinks as from a branding iron—was licensed
without a word of remonstrance. But there is a searching
passage in the play where the woman confesses to a girl
friend that one of the lies by which she induced the man
to enter into relations with her was that he was not her
first lover. The friend is simple enough to express surprise,
thinking that this, far from being an inducement,
would have roused jealousy and disgust. The woman replies
that, on the contrary, no man likes to face the responsibility
of tempting a girl to her first step from the
beaten path, and that girls take care accordingly not to
let them know it.

This is one of those terrible stripping strokes by which
a master of realism suddenly exposes a social sore which
has been plastered over with sentimental nonsense about
erring Magdalens, vicious nonsense about gaiety, or simply
prudish silence. No young man or young woman
hearing it, however anarchical their opinions may be as
to sexual conduct, can possibly imagine afterwards that
the relation between ‘les hannetons’ is honest, charming,
sentimentally interesting, or pardonable by the self-respect
of either. It is felt instinctively to have something
fundamentally dishonorable in it, in spite of the innocence
of the natural affection of the pair for one another.
Yet this is precisely the passage that the Censor refused
to pass. All the rest was duly licensed. The exhibition of
the pretty, scheming, lying, sensual girl fixing herself
with triumphant success on the meanly prudent sensual
man, and having what many women would consider rathxxxviiier
a good time of it, was allowed and encouraged by the
court certificate of propriety. But the deadly touch that
made it impossible for even the most thoughtless pair in
the audience to go and do likewise without loathing themselves,
was forbidden.

Misadventure of a Frenchman in Westminster
Abbey.

In short, the censorship did what it always does: it
left the poison on the table and carefully locked up the
antidote. And it did this, not from a fiendish design to
destroy the souls of the people, but solely because the passage
involved a reference by a girl to her virginity, which
is unusual and therefore tabooed. The Censor never
troubled himself as to the meaning or effect of the passage.
It represented the woman as doing an unusual thing:
therefore a dangerous, possibly subversive thing. In England,
when we are scandalized and can give no direct reason
why, we exclaim ‘What next?’ That is the continual
cry of the Censor’s soul. If a girl may refer to her virginity
on the stage, what may she not refer to? This instinctive
regard to consequences was once impressed
painfully on a pious Frenchman who, in Westminster
Abbey, knelt down to pray. The verger, who had never
seen such a thing happen before, promptly handed him
over to the police and charged him with ‘brawling.’
Fortunately, the magistrate had compassion on the foreigner’s
ignorance; and even went the length of asking
why he should not be allowed to pray in church. The reply
of the verger was simple and obvious. ‘If we allowed that,’
he said, ‘we should have people praying all over the place.’
And to this day the rule in Westminster Abbey is that you
may stroll about and look at the monuments; but you
must not on any account pray. Similarly, on the stage you
may represent murder, gluttony, sexual vice, and all the
crimes in the calendar and out of it; but you must not say
anything unusual about them.

xxxix

Marriage and Malthus.

If Brieux found himself blocked by the censorship when
he was exposing the vice of illicit unions, it will surprise
no one to learn that his far more urgently needed exposures
of the intemperance and corruption of marriage
itself was fiercely banned. The vulgar, and consequently
the official, view of marriage is that it hallows all the sexual
relations of the parties to it. That it may mask all the
vices of the coarsest libertinage with added elements of
slavery and cruelty has always been true to some extent;
but during the last forty years it has become so serious a
matter that conscientious dramatists have to vivisect
legal unions as ruthlessly as illegal ones. For it happens
that just about forty years ago the propaganda of Neo-Malthusianism
changed the bearing of children from an
involuntary condition of marriage to a voluntary one.
From the moment this momentous discovery was made,
childless marriage became available to male voluptuaries
as the cheapest way of keeping a mistress, and to female
ones as the most convenient and respectable way of being
kept in idle luxury by a man. The effects of this have
already been startling, and will yet be revolutionary as
far as marriage is concerned, both in law and custom. The
work of keeping the populations of Europe replenished
received a sudden check, amounting in France and England
to a threat of actual retrogression. The appointment
of a Royal Commission to enquire into the decline of the
birth-rate in the very sections of the population which
most need to be maintained, is probably not very far off:
the more far-seeing of those who know the facts have
prophesied such a step for a long time past. The expectation
of the Neo-Malthusians that the regulation of births
in our families would give the fewer children born a better
chance of survival in greater numbers and in fuller health
and efficiency than the children of the old unrestricted
families and of the mother exhausted by excessive childxlbearing
has no doubt been fulfilled in some cases; but, on
the whole, artificial sterility seems to be beating natural
fertility; for as far as can be judged by certain sectional
but typical private censuses, the average number of children
produced is being dragged down to one and a half
per family by the large proportion of intentionally childless
marriages, and the heavy pressure of the cost of private
childbearing on the scanty incomes of the masses.

That this will force us to a liberal State endowment of
parentage, direct or indirect, is not now doubted by people
who understand the problem: in fact, as I write, the
first open step has already been taken by the Government’s
proposal to exempt parents from the full burden
of taxation borne by the childless. There has also begun
a change in public opinion as to the open abuse of marriage
as a mere means by which any pair can procure a
certificate of respectability by paying for it, which may
quite possibly end in the disuse of the ceremony for all
except fertile unions. From the point of view of the
Church, it is a manifest profanation that couples whose
only aim is a comfortable domesticity should obtain for it
the sacrament of religious marriage on pretence of unselfish
and publicly important purposes which they have
not the smallest intention of carrying out. From the secular
point of view there is no reason why couples who do
not intend to have children should be allowed to enslave
one another by all the complicated legal restrictions of
their liberty and property which are attached to marriage
solely to secure the responsibility of parents to the
State for their children.

Brieux and the Respectable Married Man.

All these by no means remote prospects, familiar
though they are to the statesman and sociologist, are
amazing to the bourgeois even when he is personally implicated
in the change of practice that is creating the
necessity for a change in law and in opinion. He hasxli
changed his practice privately, without talking about it
except in secret, or in passages of unprintable Rabelaisian
jocosity with his friends; and he is not only unable
to see why anyone else should talk publicly about the
change, but terrified lest what he is doing furtively and
hypocritically should be suddenly dragged into the light,
and his own case recorded, perhaps, in public statistics in
support of innovations which vaguely suggest to him the
destruction of morals and the break-up of the family. But
both his pruderies and his terrors must give way before
the absolute necessity for re-examining the foundations
of our social structure after the shock they have received
from the discovery of artificial sterilization, and their readjustment
to the new strains they have to bear as a
consequence of that discovery.

Tolstoy, with his Kreutzer Sonata, was the first to
carry the war into the enemy’s country by shewing that
marriage intensified instead of eliminating every element
of evil in sexual relations; but Brieux was the first dramatist
to see not only the hard facts of the situation, but
its political importance. He has seen in particular that a
new issue has arisen in that eternal conflict of the sexes
which is created by the huge difference between the transient
pleasure of the man and the prolonged suffering of
the woman in maintaining the population. Malthusianism,
when it passed from being the speculation of an
economist to being the ardent faith of a devoted band of
propagandists, touched our feelings mainly as a protest
against the burden of excessive childbearing imposed on
married women. It was not then foreseen that the triumph
of the propaganda might impose a still worse burden
on them: the burden of enforced sterility. Before Malthus
was born, cases were familiar enough in which wives
who had borne two or three children as an inevitable consequence
of their conjugal relations had thereupon rebelled
against further travail and discontinued the relations
by such a resolute assertion of selfishness as is notxlii
easy to an amiable woman and practically not possible to a
loving or a jealous wife. But the case of a man refusing to
fulfil his parental function and thereby denying the right
of his wife to motherhood was unknown. Yet it immediately
and inevitably arose the moment men became possessed
of the means of doing this without self-denial. A
wife could thus be put in a position intolerable to a woman
of honor as distinguished from a frank voluptuary. She
could be condemned to barren bodily slavery without
remedy. To keep silence about so monstrous a wrong as
this merely because the subject is a tabooed one was not
possible to Brieux. Censorship or no censorship, it had to
be said, and indeed shouted from the housetops if nothing
else would make people attend, that this infamy existed
and must be remedied. And Brieux touched the evil at
its worst spot in that section of the middle class in which
the need for pecuniary prudence has almost swallowed
up every more human feeling. In this most wretched of
all classes there is no employment for women except the
employment of wife and mother, and no provision for
women without employment. The fathers are too poor
to provide. The daughter must marry whom she can get:
if the first chance, which she dares not refuse, is not that
of a man whom she positively dislikes, she may consider
herself fortunate. Her real hope of affection and self-respect
lies in her children. And yet she above all women is
subject to the danger that the dread of poverty which is
the ruling factor in her husband’s world may induce him
to deny her right and frustrate her function of motherhood,
using her simply as a housekeeper and a mistress
without paying her the market price of such luxuries or
forfeiting his respectability. To make us understand what
this horror means, Brieux wrote Les Trois Filles de Monsieur
Dupont, or, in equivalent English, The Three
Daughters of Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith, in the person of the
Censor, immediately shrieked ‘You must not mention
such things.’ Mr. Smith was wrong: they are just thexliii
things that must be mentioned, and mentioned again
and yet again, until they are set right. Surely, of all
the anomalies of our marriage law, there is none more
mischievously absurd than that a woman can have her
marriage annulled for her husband’s involuntary, but not
for his voluntary sterility. And the man is in the same
predicament, though his wife now has the same power
as he of frustrating the public purpose of all marriages.

Brieux shews the Other Side.

But Brieux is not, as the ordinary man mostly is, a
mere reactionist against the latest oversights and mistakes,
becoming an atheist at every flaw discovered in
popular theology, and recoiling into the grossest superstition
when some Jesuit who happens by exception to
be a clever and subtle man (about the last thing, by the
way, that a real live Jesuit ever is) shews him that popular
atheism is only theology without mind or purpose. The
ordinary man, when Brieux makes him aware of the fact
that Malthusianism has produced an unexpected and revolting
situation, instantly conceives a violent prejudice
against it, pointing to the declining population as evidence
that it is bringing ruin on the human race, and
clamoring for the return of the conjugal morality of his
grandmother, as Theodore Roosevelt did when he was
President of the United States of America. It therefore
became necessary for Brieux to head him off in his
frantic flight by writing another play, Maternity, to remind
him of the case for Malthusianism, and to warn him—if
he is capable of the warning—that progress is not
achieved by panic-stricken rushes back and forward between
one folly and another, but by sifting all movements
and adding what survives the sifting to the fabric of our
morality. For the fact that Malthusianism has made new
crimes possible should not discredit it, and cannot stop it,
because every step gained by man in his continuous effort
to control Nature necessarily does the same. Flying, forxliv
instance, which has become practical as a general human
art for the first time this year, is capable of such alarming
abuse that we are on the eve of a clamor for its restriction,
and even for its prohibition, that will speedily make the
present clamor against motor cars as completely forgotten
as the clamor against bicycles was when motor cars
appeared. But the motor car cannot be suppressed: it is
improving our roads, improving the manners and screwing
up the capacity and conduct of all who use them, improving
our regulation of traffic, improving both locomotion
and character as every victory over Nature finally
improves the world and the race. Malthusianism is no exception
to the rule: its obvious abuses, and the new need
for protecting marriage from being made a mere charter
of libertinage and slavery by its means, must be dealt
with by improvements in conduct and law, and not by a
hopeless attempt to drive us all back to the time of Mrs.
Gamp. The tyranny which denies to the wife the right
to become a mother has become possible through the
discovery of the means of escape from the no less unbearable
tyranny which compelled her to set another
child at the table round which those she had already borne
were starving because there was not enough food for
them. When the French Government, like Colonel Roosevelt,
could think of no better cure for the new tyranny
than a revival of the old, Brieux added a play on the old
tyranny to his play on the new tyranny.

This is the explanation of what stupid people call the
inconsistencies of those modern dramatists who, like
Ibsen and Brieux, are prophets as well as playwrights.
Ibsen did not write The Wild Duck to ridicule the lesson
he had already taught in Pillars of Society and An Enemy
of the People: he did it to head off his disciples when, in
their stampede from idealism, they forgot the need of
ideals and illusions to men not strong enough to bear the
truth. Brieux’s La Foi has virtually the same theme. It is
not an ultramontane tract to defend the Church againstxlv
the sceptic. It is a solemn warning that you have not, as
so many modern sceptics assume, disposed of the doctrine
when you have proved that it is false. The miracle of St.
Januarius is worked, not by men who believe in it, but by
men who know it to be a trick, but know also that men cannot
be governed by the truth unless they are capable of the
truth, and yet must be governed somehow, truth or no
truth. Maternity and The Three Daughters of Mr. Smith
are not contradictory: they are complementary, like An
Enemy of the People and The Wild Duck. I myself have
had to introduce into one of my plays a scene in which a
young man defends his vices on the ground that he is one
of my disciples. I did so because the incident had actually
occurred in a criminal court, where a young prisoner
gave the same reason and was sentenced to six months
imprisonment, less, I fear, for the offence than for the attempt
to justify it.

The Most Unmentionable of All Subjects.

Finally, Brieux attacked the most unmentionable subject
of all: the subject of the diseases that are supposed
to be the punishment of profligate men and worthless
women. Here the taboo acquires double force. Not only
must not the improper thing be mentioned; but the evil
must not be remedied, because it is a just retribution and
a wholesome deterrent. The last point may be dismissed
by simply inquiring how a disease can possibly act as a
deterrent when people are kept in ignorance of its existence.
But the punishment theory is a hideous mistake.
It might as well be contended that fires should not be put
out because they are the just punishment of the incendiary.
Most of the victims of these diseases are entirely
innocent persons: children who do not know what vice
means, and women to whom it is impossible to explain
what is the matter with them. Nor are their fathers
and husbands necessarily to blame. Even if they were,
it would be wicked to leave them unwarned when thexlvi
consequences can spread so widely beyond themselves;
for there are dozens of indirect ways in which this contagion
can take place exactly as any other contagion can.
The presence of one infected person in a house may lead
to the infection of everybody else in it even if they have
never seen one another. In fact it is impossible to prove
in any given case that the sufferer is in any way culpable:
every profligate excuses himself or herself to the doctor
on this ground; and though the excuse may not be believed,
its truth is generally possible. Add to the chances
of contagion the hereditary transmission of the disease,
and the fact that an innocent person receiving it from
a guilty partner without other grounds for divorce has
no legal redress; and it becomes at once apparent that
every guilty case may produce several innocent ones.
Under such circumstances, even if it were possible in a
civilized community to leave misconduct to be checked
by its natural or accidental consequences or by private
vengeance instead of by carefully considered legal measures,
such an anarchical solution must be ruled out in
the present case, as the disease strikes blindly at everyone
whom it reaches, and there are as many innocent
paths for its venom as guilty ones. The taboo actually
discriminates heavily against the innocent, because, as
taboos are not respected in profligate society, systematic
profligates learn the danger in their loose conversations,
and take precautions, whereas the innocent expose
themselves recklessly in complete ignorance, handling
possibly contaminated articles and entering possibly infected
places without the least suspicion that any such
danger exists. In Brieux’s play the husband alone is culpable;
but his misconduct presently involves his wife, his
child, and his child’s nurse. It requires very little imagination
to see that this by no means exhausts the possibilities.
The nurse, wholly guiltless of the original sin, is
likely to spread its consequences far more widely than
the original sinner. A grotesque result of this is that therexlvii
is always a demand, especially in France, for infected
nurses, because the doctor, when he knows the child to
be infected, feels that he is committing a crime in not
warning the nurse; and the only way out of the difficulty
is to find a nurse who is already infected and has nothing
more to fear. How little the conscience of the family is
to be depended on when the interests of a beloved child
are in the scale against a mere cold duty to a domestic
servant, has been well shewn by Brieux in the second Act
of his play. But indeed anyone who will take the trouble
to read the treatise of Fournier, or the lectures of Duclaux,
or, in English, the chapters in which Havelock
Ellis has dealt with this subject, will need no further instruction
to convince him that no play ever written was
more needed than Les Avariés.

It must be added that a startling change in the urgency
of the question has been produced by recent advances
in pathology. Briefly stated, the facts of the change
are as follows. In the boyhood of those of us who are now
of middle age, the diseases in question were known as
mainly of two kinds. One, admittedly very common, was
considered transient, easily curable, harmless to future
generations, and, to everyone but the sufferer, dismissible
as a ludicrous incident. The other was known to be one
of the most formidable scourges of mankind, capable at
its worst of hideous disfigurement and ruinous hereditary
transmission, but not at all so common as the more trifling
ailment, and alleged by some authorities to be dying out
like typhus or plague. That is the belief still entertained
by the elderly section of the medical profession and those
whom it has instructed.

This easy-going estimate of the situation was alarmingly
upset in 1879 by Neisser’s investigation of the supposedly
trivial disease, which he associated with a malignant
micro-organism called the gonococcus. The
physicians who still ridicule its gravity are now confronted
by an agitation, led by medical women and proxlviiifessional
nurses, who cite a formidable array of authorities
for their statements that it is the commonest cause
of blindness, and that it is transmitted from father to
mother, from mother to child, from child to nurse, producing
evils from which the individual attacked never
gets securely free. If half the scientific evidence be true,
a marriage contracted by a person actively affected in
either way is perhaps the worst crime that can be committed
with legal impunity in a civilized community.
The danger of becoming the victim of such a crime is the
worst danger that lurks in marriage for men and women,
and in domestic service for nurses.

Stupid people who are forced by these facts to admit
that the simple taboo which forbids the subject to be
mentioned at all is ruinous, still fall back on the plea
that though the public ought to be warned, the theatre
is not the proper place for the warning. When asked
‘What, then, is the proper place?’ they plead that
the proper place is out of hearing of the general public:
that is, not in a school, not in a church, not in a newspaper,
not in a public meeting, but in medical text-books
which are read only by medical students. This, of
course, is the taboo over again, only sufficiently ashamed
of itself to resort to subterfuge. The commonsense of
the matter is that a public danger needs a public warning;
and the more public the place the more effective
the warning.

Why the Unmentionable Must be Mentioned
on the Stage.

But beyond this general consideration there is a special
need for the warning in the theatre. The best friends
of the theatre cannot deny, and need not seek to deny,
that a considerable proportion of our theatrical entertainments
stimulate the sexual instincts of the spectators.
Indeed this is so commonly the case that a play which
contains no sexual appeal is quite openly and commonlyxlix
written of, even by professional critics of high standing,
as being ‘undramatic,’ or ‘not a play at all.’ This is the
basis of the prejudice against the theatre shewn by that
section of English society in which sex is regarded as original
sin, and the theatre, consequently, as the gate of
hell. The prejudice is thoughtless: sex is a necessary and
healthy instinct; and its nurture and education is one of
the most important uses of all art, and, for the present at
all events, the chief use of the theatre.

Now it may be an open question whether the theatre
has proved itself worthy of being entrusted with so serious
a function. I can conceive a community passing a law
forbidding dramatic authors to deal with sex as a motive
at all. Although such a law would consign the great bulk
of existing dramatic literature to the waste paper basket,
it would neither destroy it wholly nor paralyze all future
playwrights. The bowdlerization of Molière and Shakespear
on the basis of such a law would leave a surprising
quantity of their work intact. The novels of Dickens and
his contemporaries are before us to prove how independent
the imaginative writer is of the theme so often assumed
to be indispensable in fiction. The works in which
it is dragged in by the ears on this false assumption are
far more numerous than the tales and plays—Manon Lescaut
is an example—of which it forms the entire substance.
Just as the European dramatist is able to write
plays without introducing an accouchement, which is regarded
as indispensable in all sympathetic Chinese plays,
he can, if he is put to it, dispense with any theme that
law or custom could conceivably forbid, and still find himself
rich in dramatic material. Let us grant therefore that
love might be ruled out by a written law as effectually as
cholera is ruled out by an unwritten one without utterly
ruining the theatre.

Still, it is none the less beyond all question by any
reasonable and thoughtful person that if we tolerate
any subject on the stage we must not tolerate it by halves.l
It may be questioned whether we should allow war on
the stage; but it cannot sanely be questioned that, if we
do, we must allow its horrors to be represented as well
as its glories. Destruction and murder, pestilence and
famine, demoralization and cruelty, robbery and jobbery,
must be allowed to contend with patriotism and military
heroism on the boards as they do in actual war: otherwise
the stage might inflame national hatreds and lead to
their gratification with a recklessness that would make a
cockpit of Europe. Again, if unscrupulous authors are to
be allowed to make the stage a parade of champagne
bottles, syphons, and tantaluses, scrupulous ones must be
allowed to write such plays as L’Assommoir, which has,
as a matter of simple fact, effectively deterred many young
men from drunkenness. Nobody disputes the reasonableness
of this freedom to present both sides. But when we
come to sex, the taboo steps in, with the result that all
the allurements of sex may be exhibited on the stage
heightened by every artifice that the imagination of the
voluptuary can devize, but not one of its dangers and
penalties. You may exhibit seduction on the stage; but
you must not even mention illegitimate conception and
criminal abortion. We may, and do, parade prostitution
to the point of intoxicating every young person in the
theatre; yet no young person may hear a word as to the
diseases that follow prostitution and avenge the prostitute
to the third and fourth generation of them that buy
her. Our shops and business offices are full of young men
living in lonely lodgings, whose only artistic recreation
is the theatre. In the theatre we practise upon them
every art that can make their loneliness intolerable and
heighten the charm of the bait in the snares of the street
as they go home. But when a dramatist is enlightened
enough to understand the danger, and sympathetic
enough to come to the rescue with a play to expose the
snare and warn the victim, we forbid the manager to perform
it on pain of ruin, and denounce the author as ali
corrupter of morals. One hardly knows whether to laugh
or cry at such perverse stupidity.

Brieux and Voltaire.

It is a noteworthy fact that when Brieux wrote Les
Avariés (Damaged Goods) his experience with it recalled
in one particular that of Voltaire.

It will be remembered that Voltaire, whose religious
opinions were almost exactly those of most English Nonconformists
today, took refuge from the Established
Church of France near Geneva, the city of Calvin, where
he established himself as the first and the greatest of
modern Nonconformist philanthropists. The Genevese
ministers found his theology so much to their taste that
they were prevented from becoming open Voltaireans
only by the scandal he gave by his ridicule of the current
Genevese idolatry of the Bible, from which he was as free
as any of our prominent Baptists and Congregationalists.
In the same way, when Brieux, having had his Les
Avariés condemned by the now extinct French censorship,
paid a visit to Switzerland, he was invited by a
Swiss minister to read the play from the pulpit; and
though the reading actually took place in a secular building,
it was at the invitation and under the auspices of the
minister. The minister knew what the censor did not
know: that what Brieux says in Les Avariés needs saying.
The minister believed that when a thing needs saying,
a man is in due course inspired to say it, and that such
inspiration gives him a divine right to be heard. And
this appears to be the simple truth of the matter in terms
of the minister’s divinity. For most certainly Brieux had
every worldly inducement to refrain from writing this
play, and no motive for disregarding these inducements
except the motive that made Luther tear up the Pope’s
Bull, and Mahomet tell the idolatrous Arabs of Mecca that
they were worshipping stones.

The reader will now understand why these three greatlii
plays have forced themselves upon us in England as they
forced themselves upon Brieux’s own countrymen. Just
as Brieux had to write them, cost what it might, so we
have had to translate them and perform them and finally
publish them for those to read who are out of reach of the
theatre. The evils they deal with are as rampant in England
and America as they are in France. The gonococcus
is not an exclusively French microbe: the possibility of
sterilizing marriage is not bounded by the Channel, the
Rhine, or the Alps. The furious revolt of poor women
against bringing into the world more mouths to eat the
bread that is already insufficient for their firstborn, rages
with us exactly as it does in the final scene of Maternity.
Therefore these three plays are given to the English
speaking peoples first. There are others to follow of like
importance to us. And there are some, like La Française,
which we may read more lightheartedly when we have
learnt the lesson of the rest. In La Française an American
(who might just as well be an Englishman) has acquired
his ideas of France and French life, not from the
plays of Brieux, but from the conventional plays and romances
which have only one theme: adultery. Visiting
France, he is received as a friend in an ordinary respectable
French household, where he conceives himself obliged,
as a gallant man of the world, to invite his hostess
to commit with him the adultery which he imagines to
be a matter of course in every French ménage. The ignominious
failure of his enterprise makes it much better
comedy than his success would have made it in an ordinary
fashionable play.

As Good Fish in the Sea.

The total number of plays produced by Brieux up to
the date on which I write these lines is fifteen. The earliest
dates as far back as 1890. It is therefore high time for us
to begin to read him, as we have already begun to act him.
The most pitiful sort of ignorance is ignorance of the fewliii
great men who are men of our own time. Most of us die
without having heard of those contemporaries of ours for
our opportunities of seeing and applauding whom posterity
will envy us. Imagine meeting the ghost of an Elizabethan
cockney in heaven, and, on asking him eagerly
what Shakespear was like, being told either that the
cockney had never heard of Shakespear, or knew of him
vaguely as an objectionable writer of plays full of regrettable
errors of taste. To save our own ghosts from disgracing
themselves in this manner when they are asked
about Brieux, is one of the secondary uses of this first instalment
of his works in English.

ACT I

Brignac’s drawing-room. Doors right, left, and at
the back. Furniture of a government official. When the
curtain rises Lucie, a woman of about thirty, is alone.
Brignac, a man of thirty-eight, opens a door outside and
calls gaily from the anteroom.

BRIGNAC. Here I am. [He takes off his cloak, gives it
to a maid-servant, and enters].

LUCIE [gaily] Good morning, sous-préfet.

BRIGNAC [he is in the uniform of a sous-préfet. A tunic
or dolman, with simple embroidery and two rows of buttons;
a cap with an embroidered band, a sword with a
mother o’ pearl handle and a silver-plated sheath. His
belt is of silk; his trousers blue with a silver stripe;
and he wears a black cravat. He comes forward, taking
off his sword and belt during the following conversation.
He is finishing a large cigar] Have you been bored all
alone?

LUCIE. With three children one hasn’t time to be
bored.

BRIGNAC [taking his sword into the anteroom] By Jove,
no!

LUCIE. Well, how did the luncheon go off?

BRIGNAC [throwing away his cigar-end] Very well.
I’ll tell you all about it in a minute. [Going to the door
to the right and calling through] Has M. Mouton come?

2

A VOICE [from outside] Yes, monsieur le sous-préfet.
Shall I tell him he’s wanted?

BRIGNAC. No. Bring me my letters. [He closes the door
and comes back] Shall I never catch that fellow out?

LUCIE. Why do you want to?

BRIGNAC. I want to get rid of him, of course, and get
a young chap. An unmarried man wouldn’t ask half the
salary I give this one.

A clerk enters bringing letters.

CLERK. The letters, monsieur le sous-préfet.

BRIGNAC. All right.

The clerk goes out. Brignac glances at the addresses
and sorts the letters into several piles without opening the
envelopes.

LUCIE. That little ceremony always amuses me.

BRIGNAC. What ceremony? Sorting my letters?

LUCIE. Without opening them.

BRIGNAC. I know what’s inside by looking at them.

LUCIE. Nonsense!

BRIGNAC. Don’t you believe it? Well, look. Here’s
one from the mayor of St. Sauveur. Something he asks
me to forward to the préfet. [He opens it and hands the
letter to his wife, who does not take it] There!

LUCIE. Why doesn’t he send it direct to the préfet?

BRIGNAC. What would be the use of us then?

LUCIE [laughing] That’s true.

BRIGNAC. Now I suppose you’ll make some more jokes
about sous-préfets and their work. It’s easy, and not particularly
clever. Perhaps some of us don’t take our jobs
very seriously, but I’m not like that. If we are useless,
our business is to make ourselves indispensable. Just
take to-day for example and see if I’m not busy enough.
This morning I signed thirty documents; afterwards I
went to the meeting of the Council of Revision.1 Then
came this luncheon of the mayor’s to all these gentle3men.
Now I shall have an hour of office-work, and then
I shall have to go and meet our guests and bring them
here, to our own dinner. [Pause] Oh! and I forgot—after
dinner there will be that reception at the Club that
they put off to suit me. That’s a fairly full official day,
isn’t it?



[1] The Board appointed to inspect conscripts, and see if they are fit
for military service.—Note by the Translator.

LUCIE. Yes.

BRIGNAC. We shall only have part of the Committee
at dinner. Some of the members have refused. [With
interest] Hullo! I didn’t see this. A letter from the
Minister of the Interior.

LUCIE. Perhaps it’s your promotion.

BRIGNAC [opening the letter] One never knows—No,
it’s a circular [pause] upon the decline of the population.
[He runs his eye through the paper] Most important.
[He goes to the door on the right] M. Lioret!

A clerk comes in.

CLERK. Yes, monsieur le sous-préfet?

BRIGNAC [giving him papers] Give that to M. Mouton.
It must be done by five o’clock, and well done. This for
M. Lamblin—M. Rouge—And put this upon my desk. I
will see to it myself and give it the attention it requires.

The clerk goes out.

LUCIE. Perhaps it’s not worth attention.

BRIGNAC. It needs an acknowledgment anyway; and
the terms used in the original must be most carefully
reproduced in the acknowledgment.

LUCIE. Now tell me how the luncheon went off.

BRIGNAC. I have told you. It went off very well. Too
well. The mayor wanted to be even with us. All the
same, our dinner to-night will be better. [He takes a
cigar out of his pocket] I brought away a cigar to show
it to you. Are ours as big?

LUCIE. Pretty much the same.

BRIGNAC. He doesn’t give you cigars like that at his
big receptions. There’s the menu.

LUCIE [glancing at it] Oh! I say!

4

BRIGNAC. The champagne was decanted!

LUCIE. Well, we’ll have ours decanted. [Brightly]
Only, you know, it’ll cost money. We shouldn’t have
much left if we had to give many dinners to Councils
of Revision.

BRIGNAC. Don’t worry about that. You know very
well that when Balureau gets back into power he’ll have
us out of this dead-alive Châteauneuf, and give us a step
up.

LUCIE. Yes; but will he get back into power?

BRIGNAC. Why shouldn’t he?

LUCIE. He was in such a short time.

BRIGNAC. Precisely. They hadn’t time to find him out.

LUCIE [laughing] If he heard you!

BRIGNAC. You misunderstand me. I have the greatest
respect for—

LUCIE [interrupting] I know, I know. I was only joking.

BRIGNAC. You’re always worrying about the future;
now what makes me the man I am is my persistent confidence
in the future. If Balureau doesn’t get into office
again we’ll stay quietly at Châteauneuf, that’s all. You
can’t complain, as you were born here.

LUCIE. But it’s you who complain.

BRIGNAC. I complain of the want of spirit in the people.
I complain that I cannot get them to love and respect
our political institutions. I complain above all of the
society of Châteauneuf: a set of officials entertaining
one another.

LUCIE. Society in Châteauneuf doesn’t open its arms
to us, certainly.

BRIGNAC. It doesn’t think us important enough.

LUCIE. To have a larger acquaintance we ought to entertain
the commercial people. You won’t do that.

BRIGNAC. I have to consider the dignity of my position.

LUCIE. As you often say, we are in the enemy’s camp.

BRIGNAC. That’s true. But the fact that people hate5
me shows that I am a person of some importance. We
must look out for the unexpected. How do you know
some great opportunity won’t come in my way to-morrow,
or next month, or in six months? An opportunity
to distinguish myself and force the people in Paris to
pay attention to me.

LUCIE. Yes; you’ve been waiting for that opportunity
for eleven years.

BRIGNAC. Obviously then it is so much the nearer.

LUCIE. And what will it be?

BRIGNAC. Some conflict, some incident—trouble.

LUCIE. Trouble at Châteauneuf?

BRIGNAC. I’m quite aware that Châteauneuf is most
confoundedly peaceable. One gets no chance. I count
more upon Balureau than on anything else. [Pause] Is
Annette with her friend Gabrielle?

LUCIE. No.

BRIGNAC. But this is Tuesday.

LUCIE. It’s not time for her to go yet.

BRIGNAC. Yes, but if she puts it off till too late.

LUCIE. I’ve wanted for some time to speak to you
about Annette. Don’t you think she goes to the Bernins
a little too often?

BRIGNAC. Not at all. They’re very influential people
and may be useful to me. Call her. [He goes to the door
to the left and calls himself] Annette! [Coming back]
Annette goes three times a week to practise with Mademoiselle
Bernin, who goes everywhere. That’s an excellent
thing for us, and may be of consequence. [Annette
comes in] Annette, don’t forget how late it is. It’s
time you were with your friend.

ANNETTE [going out] Yes, yes. I’ll go and put on my
hat.

LUCIE [to Brignac] They want Annette to spend a
few days with them in the country. Ought we to let her?

BRIGNAC. Why not? She wants to go. You know how
fond she is of Gabrielle.

6

LUCIE. Yes; but Gabrielle has a brother.

BRIGNAC. Young Jacques. But he’s going to be married,
my dear.

LUCIE. Is he?

BRIGNAC. Yes, yes, of course. [Annette comes in from
the left] Make haste, Annette.

LUCIE. What does it matter if she’s five minutes late?

ANNETTE.. No—no—Where is my music?

LUCIE. You look quite upset. Would you rather not
go?

ANNETTE. Yes, yes, I’ll go—Good-bye. [She hurries
off, forgetting her music].

LUCIE [calling] Your music! [she holds out the music-case].

ANNETTE. Oh, thank you. Good-bye. [She goes out].

LUCIE. Don’t you think Annette has been a little depressed
lately?

BRIGNAC. Eh? Yes—no—has she? Have you found a
new parlor-maid?

LUCIE. Yes.

BRIGNAC. There, you see! You were worrying about
that.

LUCIE. I had good reason to worry. I’ve been without
a parlor-maid for a week. I liked a girl who came yesterday
very much; but she wouldn’t take the place.

BRIGNAC. Why not?

LUCIE. She said there were too many children here.

BRIGNAC.. Too many children! Three!

LUCIE. Yes: but the eldest is three years old and the
youngest two months.

BRIGNAC. There’s a nurse.

LUCIE. I told her that, of course.

BRIGNAC. Well, I declare! And when you consider
that it meant coming to the sous-préfet!

LUCIE. I suppose she’s not impressed by titles.

BRIGNAC. And what about the one you have engaged?

LUCIE. She’s elderly. Perhaps she’ll be steady.

7

BRIGNAC. Yes, and have other vices. Still—

LUCIE. The unhappy woman has two children out at
nurse, and two older ones at Bordeaux. Her husband
deserted her.

BRIGNAC. Too bad of Céline to force us to turn her out
of doors.

LUCIE. Her conduct was bad, certainly. All the same—

BRIGNAC. Oh, it was not her conduct! She might have
conducted herself ten times worse if only she had had
the sense to keep up appearances. Outside her duty to
me her life was her own. But we have to draw the line at
a confinement in the house. You admit that, don’t you?
[A pause. Lucie does not answer] It was getting quite unmistakable—you
know it was. Those wretched grocer’s
boys are a perfect scourge to decent houses. [He takes
up a paper] This circular is admirable.

LUCIE. Is it?

BRIGNAC. And of the greatest importance. Such style,
too. Listen. [He reads] ‘Our race is diminishing! Such
a state of affairs demands the instant attention of the authorities.
The Legislature must strenuously endeavour
to devise remedial measures against the disastrous phenomenon
now making itself manifest in our midst.’ The
Minister of the Interior has done this very well. The end
is really fine—quite touching. Listen. ‘Truth will triumph:
reason will prevail: the noble sentiment of nationality
and the divine spirit of self-sacrifice will bear us
on to victory. We who know the splendid recuperative
power of our valiant French race look forward with confidence
and security to the magnificent moral regeneration
of this great and ancient people.’ [He looks at his
wife].

LUCIE. It’s well written, certainly.

BRIGNAC [continuing to read] ‘Let each one, in his
own sphere of action and influence, work with word and
pen to point out the peril and urge the immediate necessity
of a remedy. Committees must be formed all over8
France to evolve schemes and promote measures by
which the birth-rate may be raised.’

LUCIE. Does it suggest any scheme?

BRIGNAC. Yes. The rest of the circular is full of the
ways and means. I shall read it aloud this evening.

LUCIE. This evening!

BRIGNAC. Yes. [He goes to the right hand door and
calls] Monsieur Lioret!

CLERK [coming in] Monsieur le sous-préfet.

BRIGNAC. Make me two copies of this circular yourself;
you will understand its great importance. And
bring the original back yourself and place it upon this
table.

CLERK. Yes, monsieur le sous-préfet. [He goes out].

BRIGNAC [returning to Lucie] The covering letter from
my official superior ends with these words: ‘Have the
goodness, M. le sous-préfet, to send me at once a statistical
schedule of all committees or associations of this
nature at present existing in your district, and let me
know what measures you think of taking in response to
the desiderata of the Government.’ Well, I shall take
advantage of the dinner we give to-night to the members
of the Council of Revision to set on foot some associations
of the sort, and then I can write up to the authorities,
’There were no associations: I created them’!

LUCIE. But is the dinner a suitable—

BRIGNAC. Listen to me. This morning there was a
Council of Revision at Châteauneuf.

LUCIE. Yes.

BRIGNAC. The mayor invited the members to luncheon
and we have invited them to dinner.

LUCIE. Well?

BRIGNAC. The Council of Revision is composed of a
Councillor to the Prefecture, a general Councillor, a
district Councillor—I leave out the doctor—and the
mayors of the communes concerned—the mayors of the
communes concerned. I shall profit by the chance of hav9ing
them all together after dinner to-night—after a dinner
where the champagne will be decanted, mind you—to
impress them with my own enthusiasm and conviction.
They shall create local committees, and I shall presently
announce the formation of those committees to
the authorities. So even if Balureau doesn’t get into
power, I shall sooner or later force the Minister to say,
’But why don’t we give a man like Brignac a really active
post?’ This is a first-rate opening for us: I saw it at
a glance. After dinner I shall shew them my diagram.
You must make my office into a cloak-room, and—

LUCIE [interrupting] Why? There’s room in the hall.

BRIGNAC. I can’t put the diagram in the hall, and I
want an excuse for bringing them all through the office.
Some day the Colonel may meet the Minister of the Interior
and say to him: ‘I saw in the sous-préfecture at
Châteauneuf’—

LUCIE [interrupting again] All right. As you like.

BRIGNAC. You trust to me. You don’t understand anything
about it. You didn’t even know how a Council of
Revision was made up,—you, the wife of a sous-préfet.
And yet every year we give them a dinner. And we’ve
been married four years.

LUCIE [gently and pleasantly] Now think for a minute.
We’ve been married four years, that’s true. But this
time three years was just after Edmée was born: two
years ago I was expecting little Louise; and last year
after weaning her I was ill. Remember too that if I had
nursed the last one myself I could not be at dinner tonight,
as she is only two months old.

BRIGNAC. You complain of that?

LUCIE [laughing] No: but I am glad to be having a
holiday.

BRIGNAC [gaily] You know what I said: as long as we
haven’t a boy—

LUCIE [brightly] We ought to have a trip to Switzerland
first.

10

BRIGNAC. No, no, no. We have only girls: I want a
boy.

LUCIE [laughing] Is it the Minister’s circular that—

BRIGNAC. No, it is not the Minister’s circular.

LUCIE. Then let me have time to breathe.

BRIGNAC. You can breathe afterwards.

LUCIE. Before.

BRIGNAC. After.

LUCIE. Wouldn’t you rather have a holiday?

BRIGNAC. No.

LUCIE [gently] Listen, Julien, since we’re talking
about this. I wanted to tell you—I haven’t had much
leisure since our marriage. We’ve not been able to take
advantage of a single one of your holidays. And if you
don’t agree to let—[tenderly] Maurice—wait another
year it will be the same thing this time. [Smiling] I
really have a right to a little rest. Consider. We’ve not
had any time to know one another, or to love one another.
Besides, remember that we already have to find
dowries for three girls.

BRIGNAC. I tell you this is going to be a boy.

LUCIE. A boy is expensive.

BRIGNAC. We are going to be rich.

LUCIE. How?

BRIGNAC. Luck may come in several ways. I may stay
in the Civil Service and get promoted quickly. I may go
back to the Bar: I was a fairly successful barrister once.
I may have some unexpected stroke of luck. Anyway,
I’m certain we shall be rich. [Smiling] After all, it’s
not much good you’re saying no, if I say yes.

LUCIE [hurt] Evidently. My consent was asked for
before I was given a husband, but my consent is not
asked for before I am given a child.

BRIGNAC. Are you going to make a scene?

LUCIE. No. But all the same—this slavery—

BRIGNAC. What?

LUCIE. Yes, slavery. After all you are disposing of my11
health, my sufferings, my life—of a year of my existence,
calmly, without consulting me.

BRIGNAC. Do I do it out of selfishness? Do you suppose
I am not a most unhappy husband all the time I
have a future mother at my side instead of a loving wife?
’A father is a man all the same.’

LUCIE [ironically] Oh, you are most unhappy, aren’t
you?

BRIGNAC. Yes.

LUCIE. Rubbish!

BRIGNAC. Rubbish?

LUCIE. You evidently take me for a fool.

BRIGNAC. I don’t understand.

LUCIE. I know what you do at those times. Now do
you understand?

BRIGNAC. No.

LUCIE [irritated] Don’t deny it. You must see that I
know all about it. The best thing you can do is to be
silent, as I have pretended so far to know nothing.

BRIGNAC [coming off his high-horse] I assure you—

LUCIE. Do you want me to tell you the name of the
person you go to see over at Villeneuve, while I am
nursing, or a ‘future mother’ as you call it?

BRIGNAC. If you’re going to believe all the gossip you
hear—

LUCIE. We had better say no more about it.

BRIGNAC. I beg to observe that it was not I who
started the subject. There, there—you’re in a bad temper.
I shall go and do some work, and then I must join
those gentlemen. Only, you know, you’re mistaken.

LUCIE. Oh, yes, of course.

He goes out to the right, shrugging his shoulders. Lucie
rings. Catherine comes in.

LUCIE. Are Nurse and Josephine out with the children?

CATHERINE. Yes, madame.

LUCIE [beaming] Were my little ones well and happy?

12

CATHERINE. Oh, yes, madame.

LUCIE [sincerely] Aren’t my little girls pretty?

CATHERINE. Yes: pretty and clever.

LUCIE. The other day Edmée was talking about playing
horses, and Louise said ‘’orses’ quite distinctly. It’s
wonderful at her age.

CATHERINE. I’ve seen lots of children, but I never saw
such nice ones before.

LUCIE. I’m so glad. You’re a good creature, Catherine.

Annette comes in. She pulls off her hat, wild with joy.

ANNETTE. Lucie! Sister! News! Great news! Good
news!

LUCIE. What is it?

ANNETTE [giving her hat to Catherine] Take this,
Catherine, and go. [She pushes her out gently].

LUCIE [laughing] Well!

ANNETTE. I must kiss you, kiss you! I wanted to kiss
the people in the street. [She bursts into a laugh which
ends in a sob].

LUCIE. Little sister Annette, you’ve gone quite mad.

ANNETTE. No—not mad—I’m so happy.

LUCIE. What is it, little girl?

ANNETTE [in tears] I’m happy! I’m happy!

LUCIE. Why, what’s the matter with the child?

ANNETTE. No, no. It’s all right—don’t speak to me.
I shall soon be better. It’s nervous. [She laughs and
cries at the same time]. I tell you I’m happy—only—only—How
stupid it is to cry like this. I can’t help it.
[She puts her arms round Lucie’s neck]. Oh, little
mother, I love you—I do love you. [She kisses Lucie:
another little sob]. Oh, I am silly. There now, it’s all
right—I’ve done. [She wipes her eyes] There: now I’m
going to tell you. [With great joy and emotion, and
very simply] I am going to be married. Monsieur and
Madame Bernin are coming to see you about it.

LUCIE. Why?

ANNETTE. Because Jacques has told them to.

13

LUCIE. Jacques!

ANNETTE [very fast, tumbling out the words] Yes, it
was when I was practising with Gabrielle. He had
guessed—it happened this way—practising—he sings
a little—oh, nothing very grand—once—[she laughs]
but I’ll tell you about that afterwards—it’s because of
that—We shall be married soon. [Fresh tears. Then
she says gravely, embracing Lucy] I do love him so,
and if he hadn’t asked me to marry him—You don’t
understand?

LUCIE [laughing] I guess a little.

ANNETTE. Do you want me to tell you all about it,
from the beginning?

LUCIE. Yes.

ANNETTE. I want to so much. If it won’t bore you.
It would make me so happy.

LUCIE. Go on.

ANNETTE. Well, when I was playing duets with
Gabrielle—I must tell you that I began by detesting
him because he will make fun of everybody. But he’s
most kind, really. For instance—

LUCIE. Now keep to the point. When you played
duets—

ANNETTE. Yes, I was telling you. When I played
duets with Gabrielle he used to come and listen to us.
He stood behind us to turn over the leaves: once he
put his hand upon my shoulder—

LUCIE. You let him?

ANNETTE. He had his other hand on Gabrielle’s shoulder—it
would have been priggish to say anything.

LUCIE. Yes, but with Gabrielle it’s different.

ANNETTE. That’s what I was going to say. My heart
began beating so—I got so red, and I had no idea what
I was playing. And then, another time—he couldn’t see
the music—he stooped right down. But that’s all nothing.
We love each other, that’s the whole thing.

LUCIE. And has he told you that he loves you?

14

ANNETTE [gravely] Yes.

LUCIE. And you hid all that from me? I’m sorry, Annette.

ANNETTE. I’m so, so sorry. But it all came so gradually.
I can hardly tell now exactly when it began. I
even thought I was mistaken. And then—then—when
we first dared to speak to one another about what we
had never spoken of, though we both knew it so well—I
knew I’d done wrong. But I was so ashamed I couldn’t
tell you about it then.

LUCIE [tenderly] All the same it was very naughty of
you, darling.

ANNETTE. Oh, don’t scold me! Please, please don’t
scold me. If you only knew how I’ve repented—how
unhappy I’ve been. Haven’t you noticed?

LUCIE. Yes. Then he’s spoken to his father and
mother?

ANNETTE. Some time ago.

LUCIE. And they consent?

ANNETTE. They are coming this afternoon.

LUCIE. Why didn’t they come sooner?

ANNETTE. Well—Jacques begged them to, but they
didn’t want it at first. They wanted Gabrielle to be
married first. It was even arranged that I should pretend
I didn’t know they had been told. Then, to-day, I
met Jacques in the street—

LUCIE. In the street?

ANNETTE. Yes. Lately he has not been coming to our
practices—so I meet him—

LUCIE. In the street!

ANNETTE. Generally we only bow to one another, and
that’s all. But to-day he said to me as he passed, ‘My
mother is going to your house. She’s there behind me.’
Then I hurried in to tell you. [With a happy smile] He
was quite pale. Please don’t scold me, I am so happy.
Forgive me.

LUCIE [kissing her] Yes: I forgive you. Then you’re15
going away from me, you bad thing.

ANNETTE. Yes, I am bad. Bad and ungrateful. That’s
true.

LUCIE. Marriage is a serious thing. Are you sure you
will suit one another?

ANNETTE. Oh, I’m certain of it. We’ve quarrelled already.

LUCIE. What about?

ANNETTE. About a book he lent me.

LUCIE. What book?

ANNETTE. Anna Karenina. He liked Vronsky better
than Peter Levin. He talked nonsense. He said he
didn’t believe in Madame Karenina’s suicide. You remember,
she throws herself under the wheels of the train
Vronsky is going away in. Don’t you remember? It
doesn’t matter.

LUCIE. And then?

ANNETTE. And then—there’s a ring—perhaps that’s
the Bernins.

A silence. Catherine appears with a card.

LUCIE. Yes. It’s Madame Bernin.

ANNETTE. Oh! [Going to her room] You’ll come and
fetch me presently.

LUCIE. Yes. [To Catherine] Show the lady in.

ANNETTE. Don’t be long.

She goes out. Lucie tidies herself before a glass. Madame
Bernin comes in.

MME. B. How do you do, Madame Brignac?

LUCIE. How do you do, madame?

MME. B. Are you quite well?

LUCIE. Very well, madame. And you?

MME. B. I need not ask after M. Brignac.

LUCIE. And M. Bernin?

MME. B. He’s very well, thank you.

LUCIE. Won’t you sit down?

MME. B. Thank you. [Sits] What lovely weather.

LUCIE. Yes, isn’t it? How lucky you are to be able16
to get into the country. Annette is so looking forward
to her visit to you.

MME. B. Well, I came to-day—first of all to have the
pleasure of seeing you—and then to have a chat with
you about that very matter.

LUCIE. And about another matter, too, I think.

MME. B. Another matter?

LUCIE. Not about another?

MME. B. No, I don’t quite understand—

LUCIE. Oh, then I beg your pardon. Tell me what it is
about Annette’s visit.

MME. B. My daughter has just got an invitation to
spend some time with her cousins the Guibals, and we
can’t possibly refuse to let Gabrielle go to them. So I’ve
come to beg you to excuse us, because—as Gabrielle
won’t be there—

LUCIE. Oh, of course, madame. Will Mademoiselle
Gabrielle make a long stay with her cousins?

MME. B. Well, that’s just what’s so annoying. We
don’t know exactly: it might be a week, or it might be
a month. And she may stay there all the time we are
away from Châteauneuf.

LUCIE. Poor little Annette!

MME. B. But I thought you were going away somewhere
yourselves this Easter?

LUCIE. Yes.

MME. B [kindly] That relieves my mind a little, and
I hope it will make up to Mademoiselle Annette for the
disappointment I am obliged to cause her—to my very
great regret.

LUCIE [after a silence] Will you excuse me, madame.
[Hesitating] Perhaps this is indiscreet.

MME. B. Oh, I am sure not, Madame Brignac.

LUCIE. I only wanted to ask you if it is long since
Mademoiselle Gabrielle got this invitation from her
cousins?

MME. B. About a week.

17

LUCIE. A week!

MME. B. Why does that surprise you?

LUCIE. Because she did not mention it to Annette.

MME. B. She was afraid of disappointing her.

LUCIE. Only yesterday Annette was telling me about
all sorts of excursions your daughter was planning for
them both. Madame, this invitation is an excuse:
please tell me the whole truth. Annette is only my
sister, but I love her as if she was my own child, and I
speak as a mother to a mother. I’m not going to try to
be clever or to stand on my dignity. This is how it is:
Annette believes your son loves her, and when you were
announced just now she thought you came to arrange
her marriage with him. Now you know all that I know.
Tell me the truth, and let us do what we can to prevent
unhappiness.

MME. B. As you speak so simply and feelingly I will
tell you candidly exactly what is in my mind. As a matter
of fact this invitation to Gabrielle is only a device of
ours to prevent Jacques and Annette seeing any more
of one another.

LUCIE. Then you don’t want them to see any more
of one another?

MME. B. No, because I don’t want them to marry.

LUCIE. Because Annette is poor?

MME. B [after some hesitation] Well—since we’re
speaking plainly—yes, because she is poor. Ah, dear
Madame Brignac, we have both been very much to
blame for not foreseeing what has happened.

LUCIE. We have been to blame?

MME. B. I know Annette, and I like her very much.
I know you too, better than you think, and I have the
greatest respect and esteem for you; it has never even
occurred to me that in seeking our acquaintance you
had any other motive than friendship. But you ought
to have feared and foreseen what has happened?

LUCIE. What should I fear? Annette went to see18
Gabrielle. How could I know that you let your son be
with them? You knew it because it happened at your
house, and it is you who have been wanting in prudence
and foresight. You invited this poor child, you exposed
her to danger, you let her take a fancy to your son, you
allowed them to fall in love with one another, and you
come to-day and calmly tell me that this marriage is
impossible, and you are going off to the country leaving
it to me to break the poor child’s heart.

MME. B. How do you know I foresaw nothing? And
how can one tell the right moment to interfere to prevent
playmates becoming lovers? While I was uncertain
didn’t I run the risk of causing the very thing I was
anxious to prevent, by separating them without a good
reason? When I really felt sure there was danger I
spoke to Jacques. I said to him ‘Annette is not a
suitable match for you: you must be very careful how
you behave to her: don’t forget to treat this girl as a
sister.’

LUCIE. And he said ‘It is too late: we love each
other.’

MME. B. On the contrary, he said: ‘You needn’t worry,
mother. I have been thinking the same thing myself,
and I am a man of honor. Besides, though Annette is
charming, she’s not the sort of woman I mean to marry.’

LUCIE. How long ago did he tell you that?

MME. B. About two months ago.

LUCIE. Well, at that time he had already spoken of
marriage to Annette; or at least he had spoken of love,
which from him to her is the same thing.

MME. B. I can only tell you what I know.

LUCIE. Well, madame, all this is beside the question.
You are opposed to this marriage?

MME. B. Yes.

LUCIE. Finally? Irrevocably?

MME. B. Finally. Irrevocably.

LUCIE. Because Annette has no money?

19

MME. B. Yes.

LUCIE. Your son knew she had no money when he
made her love him.

MME. B. Believe me, he didn’t mean to do the harm
he has done. A young girl of his own age was his sister’s
constant companion, and at first he treated her as he
treated his sister. At first, I’m sure, it was without any
special intention that he saw so much of her. Afterwards
probably he made some pretty speeches to your
little Annette, and no doubt he was greatly taken with
her. As Annette is more innocent and simple and affectionate,
and of course more ignorant than he is, she has
been more quickly and more deeply touched. But my
son is not the worthless fellow you think him, and the
proof of that is that he himself came and told me all
about it.

LUCIE. And when you told him he must give up Annette,
he agreed?

MME. B. Yes, he agreed. He’s reasonable and sensible,
and he saw the force of my arguments. He saw that this
parting, though it will be painful, was an absolute necessity.
He will certainly suffer; but they are both so
young. At that age love troubles don’t last.

LUCIE. I understand. In a week your son will have
forgotten all about it. But Annette—

MME. B. She will soon forget it, too.

LUCIE. I don’t know—I don’t know. Oh, my poor
darling! If you had seen her just now when she came
to tell me about it! It’s not for joy she will cry now.
Oh!—[she begins to cry].

MME. B [moved] Don’t cry—oh, don’t cry. I assure
you I am most deeply sorry. Oh, if it were only possible,
how happy it would make me that my boy should marry
Annette. The girl he is engaged to is an affected little
thing who annoys me, and I really love your sister.

LUCIE. But if that is true you can afford to let your
son marry a girl without fortune.

20

MME. B. No: we’re not so well off as people think.
There’s Gabrielle to be provided for. There will be next
to nothing left for Jacques.

LUCIE. But he might work.

MME. B. He has not been brought up to that.

LUCIE. That was a mistake.

MME. B. The professions are overcrowded. Would you
have him go into an office and get 200 francs a month?
They wouldn’t be able to keep a servant.

LUCIE. He could earn more than that.

MME. B. If he got 500—could he keep up his position?
Could he remain in his present set? It would be a come-down
for him; a come-down he would owe to his wife;
and sooner or later he would reproach her for it. And
think of their children! They would have just enough
to send their son to a board school, and make their
daughter a post office clerk. And even then they would
have to pinch and screw to provide for her until she got
in.

LUCIE. It’s true.

MME. B. You see that I’m right. I can’t say I’m proud
of having to say such things—of belonging to a society
that forces one to do such things. But we’re not in a land
of romance. We live among vain, selfish, hard-headed
people.

LUCIE. You despise them, and yet you sacrifice everything
to their opinion.

MME. B. Yes: because everything depends upon their
opinion. Social position depends upon it. One must
be a very exceptional person to be able to defy public
opinion. And Jacques is not exceptional.

LUCIE. That’s nothing to be proud of. If he was exceptional,
I mean if he was different to all these people
about, he would find his love would prevent him from
troubling about the sneers of worthless idlers.

MME. B. His love! Love goes: poverty stays: it is a
proverb. Beauty passes: want remains.

21

LUCIE. But you, madame, yourself—you and your
husband are a proof that one can marry poor and make
a fortune. Your story is well known. Your husband began
in an office, then he started his own business; and
if riches make happiness, you are happy now—you and
he—aren’t you?

MME. B. No, no, no; we are not happy, because we
have worn ourselves out hunting after happiness. We
wanted to ‘get on,’ and we got on. But what a price we
paid for it! First, when we were both earning wages, our
life was one long drudgery of petty economy and meanness.
When we set up on our own account we lived in
an atmosphere of trickery, of enmity, of lying; flattering
the customers, and always in terror of bankruptcy.
Oh, I know the road to fortune! It means tears, lies,
envy, hate; one suffers—and one makes other people
suffer. I’ve had to go through it: my children shan’t.
We’ve only had two children: we meant only to have
one. Having two we had to be doubly hard upon ourselves.
Instead of a husband and wife helping one another,
we have been partners spying upon one another;
calling one another to account for every little expenditure
or stupidity; and on our very pillows disputing
about our business. That’s how we got rich; and now
we can’t enjoy our money because we don’t know how
to use it; and we aren’t happy because our old age is
made bitter by the memories and the rancor left from
the old bad days: because we have suffered too much
and hated too much. My children shall not go through
this. I endured it that they might be spared. Good-bye,
madame.

LUCIE. Good-bye.

Madame Bernin goes out. After a moment Lucie goes
slowly to Annette’s door and opens it.

ANNETTE [coming in] You’ve been crying! It’s because
I’m going away, isn’t it? Not because there’s anything
in the way of—[with increasing trouble] Tell me, Lucie!

22

LUCIE. You love him so much then?

ANNETTE. If we were not to be married—I should die.

LUCIE. No, you wouldn’t die. Think of all the girls
who have said that: did they die?

ANNETTE. Is there anything to prevent?

LUCIE. No, no.

ANNETTE. And when is it to be? Did you talk about
that?

LUCIE. What a state of excitement you are in! Annette,
dear, you must try to control yourself a little.

ANNETTE [making an effort] Yes. You’re right. I’m a
little off my head.

LUCIE. You are really.

ANNETTE [still controlling herself] Well, tell me. What
did Madame Bernin say?

LUCIE. What a hurry you are in to leave me! You
don’t care for me any more, then?

ANNETTE [gravely] Ah, my dear! If I hadn’t you what
would become of me! [A silence] But you’re telling me
nothing. You don’t seem to be telling me the truth—you’re
hiding something from me—there is some difficulty,
I’m certain of it. If there wasn’t you’d say there
wasn’t, you wouldn’t put me off—you’d tell me what
Madame Bernin said.

LUCIE. Well—there is something.

ANNETTE [bursting into tears] Oh, my God!

LUCIE. You are both very young. It would be better
to wait a little—a year—perhaps more.

ANNETTE [crying] Wait—a year!

LUCIE. Come, come, stop crying. There’s really no
reason for all this. I am not quite pleased with you,
Annette. You’re barely nineteen. If you waited to
marry until you are twenty it would be no harm.

ANNETTE. It’s not possible!

LUCIE. Not possible? [She looks searchingly at her].
Annette, you frighten me. If it wasn’t you—[tenderly
and gravely] Have I been wrong to trust you?

23

ANNETTE. No! No! What can you be thinking of—Oh,
indeed—

LUCIE. What is it, then?

ANNETTE. Well, I’ve been such a fool as to tell some
friends I was engaged.

LUCIE. Before speaking to me about it?

ANNETTE [confused] Don’t, please, ask me any more
questions.

LUCIE. Annette, I must scold you a little. You’ve hurt
me very much by keeping me in the dark about all this.
Nothing would have made me believe that you’d do such
a thing. I thought you were too fond of me not to tell me
at once about anybody—any man—you were interested
in. I find I was mistaken. We see one another every day,
we are never parted, and yet you have managed to conceal
from me the one thing your heart was full of. You
ought to have told me. Not because I am your elder
sister, but because I take mother’s place towards you.
And for a better reason still—because I am your friend.
It’s been a kind of treason. A little more, and I should
have heard that you were engaged from strangers and
not from you. Well, my dear, you’ve been wrong: these
people are not worth crying about. Now be brave and
remember your self-respect: I am going to tell you the
whole truth. They don’t want you, my poor little girl:
you are not rich enough for them.

ANNETTE [staring blindly at her sister] They don’t
want me! They don’t want me! But Jacques! Jacques!
Does he know?

LUCIE. Yes, he knows.

ANNETTE. He means to give me up if they tell him to?

LUCIE. Yes.

ANNETTE [beside herself] I must see him. I will write
to him. I must see him. If they don’t want me there is
nothing left but to kill myself.

LUCIE [obliging Annette to look her in the face] Annette,
look at me. [Silence. Then tenderly and gravely]24
I think you have something to tell me.

ANNETTE [tearing herself away] Don’t ask me—don’t
[very low] or I shall die of shame.

Lucie forces her to sit down beside her and takes her in
her arms.

LUCIE. Come—into my arms. Put your head on my
shoulder as you used when you were little. There now,
tell me what the trouble is. [Speaking low]. My darling—my
little darling—I’m afraid you’re most unhappy.
Try and think that it’s mother.

ANNETTE [very low, crying piteously] Oh, mother! If
you knew what I have done!

LUCIE [rocking her gently] There—tell me. Whisper
it to me. Whisper—

Annette whispers. Lucie rises and separates herself
from her sister. She hides her face in her hands.

LUCIE. Oh, Annette! You!

ANNETTE [kneeling and stretching out her arms] Forgive
me! Forgive me! Forgive me! I deserve it all. But
I’m almost mad.

LUCIE. You, Annette! You!

ANNETTE. Are you going to make me sorry I didn’t
kill myself before I told you! Forgive me—

LUCIE. Get up. It’s too awful. I must forgive you.
[She sits down].

ANNETTE [still kneeling] I didn’t know—I understood
nothing. He took me by surprise. I had loved him for
a long time. When he was with his regiment I used to
look forward for weeks to his coming home on leave.
Just the thought of seeing him used to make me tremble.
Before I even knew myself that I was in love with
him, he guessed it. He made me tell him so when he
asked me to marry him. Then one day—his father and
mother were away, and someone came and called Gabrielle,
I don’t know why. When we were alone—I didn’t
understand—I thought he had suddenly gone mad. But
when he kissed me like that I was stunned—I couldn’t25
do any thing—happy, and afraid, and ashamed. That was
three months ago. The next day I met him in the street.
I was in such a state that he said, quite of himself ‘I shall
speak at once to my people about our marriage.’ I know
he meant it, because really he is honest and good. Only,
I suppose he hadn’t courage. Then, when I found they
were going away so soon, I said to him yesterday ‘You
must speak.’ And now they don’t want me!

LUCIE. And he knows that—?

ANNETTE. No. No. Since that day—O, that day!—I’ve
never been alone with him. We say ‘monsieur’ and
’mademoiselle’ when we meet and [in an awestruck tone]
he is the father of my child.

LUCIE [after a silence] It’s not a question now of a girl
not to be married because she is poor. It’s a question of
atoning for a crime. Julien must speak to M. Bernin.

ANNETTE. You’re going to tell him?

LUCIE. I must. Go back to your room. You’re in no
fit state to come to dinner. [She looks at the clock] I have
only just time to dress. Directly the people are gone I
shall speak to Jules. When do they go away?

ANNETTE. In a fortnight.

LUCIE. It’s no matter. Jules shall see M. Bernin tomorrow.

ANNETTE. He won’t. He’ll have nothing more to do
with me.

LUCIE. No. He will do all he can to save you.

ANNETTE. I don’t think so. Dearest, you are mistaken.

LUCIE. No, I’m not mistaken. I am certain. Go. [Annette
goes out]. I’m not mistaken. But if I were! If there
were no one but me to defend this child and her baby!
[A knock at the office door]. Come in. [The clerk enters]
What is it?

CLERK [laying a paper on the table] It is the circular
from the Minister of the Interior. M. le sous-préfet told
me to put it here.


26

ACT II

[Same scene.

[Lucie, the colonel, Madame Chevillot, Chevillot, the
sous-intendant, Brignac, Jacques Poiret, Pierre Poiret,
and Laurent. The last three are provincial mayors.

[Lucie and Madame Chevillot are in smart evening
gowns; the colonel and the sous-intendant in uniform;
Chevillot and Brignac are in evening dress; Jacques
Poiret in a frock coat, and Laurent and Pierre Poiret
in morning coats.

[It is after dinner. They are drinking coffee.

PIERRE [a tall, thin peasant, embarrassed by his coffee
cup, speaks aside to Laurent in a strong provincial accent]
A fine thing, ain’t it, to be so rich and not have enough
tables to go round.

LAURENT [formerly a working man, to Pierre Poiret]
At lunch ’twas just the same.

JACQUES [a crafty farmer, putting his cup down upon
the centre table, and speaking generally] As for me, I—

LAURENT [passing his cup to Jacques] M. le maire,
would you mind?

PIERRE [the same] M. le maire, would you—?

They get rid of their cups, passing them from one to the
other.

BRIGNAC [to the mayors] Will you take liqueurs? [He
points to a bottle and small glasses on a tray].

27

ALL THREE [making too much fuss about it] Thank
you, thank you, M. le sous-préfet.

BRIGNAC. Delighted. [He passes behind the centre
table and pours out liqueur].

SOUS-IN [he is small and thin and wears spectacles: a
professor disguised as a soldier] Yes, ladies: it is an eccentricity.
I acknowledge it and beg you to excuse it: I
am a collector. But you must confess that I have not
bored you with it.

COLONEL [very much the fine gentleman] Indeed, no,
it was I who let out the secret. But I said also that you
are a learnèd man.

SOUS-IN. A dabbler only, colonel.

BRIGNAC [pretending to find upon the table the circular
mentioned in the first act] Hullo! what’s this? [No
one hears him. He puts the circular back again upon the
table].

LUCIE [to the sous-intendant] And are you also a literary
man?

SOUS-IN. The Intelligence Department is the literary
section of the army.

LAURENT [to Jacques Poiret, passing him his glass]
M. le maire—?

PIERRE [same thing] M. le maire—?

BRIGNAC [again taking up the circular: in a louder
voice] Hullo! What’s this? [They all look at him]. It’s
that very circular I was talking about at dinner: the
one from the Minister of the Interior.

COL. About the decline of the population?

BRIGNAC. Yes, colonel. This is an important official
document. It came to-day, and I have been carefully
considering what can be done to advance this movement
in my own humble sphere of influence. [To Chevillot]
As I said to you a short time ago, M. le maire of
Châteauneuf, the Minister desires to see the whole of
France covered with associations having the increase of
the population for their object; I am certain that you will28
desire that this town of Châteauneuf, of which you are
the chief magistrate and in which I am the representative
of the Republic, should have the honor of being
among the first to set out upon the road indicated to us.

CHEV. I’m with you. I am a manufacturer: I am all
for large populations.

BRIGNAC. You are the very man to be president of the
Châteauneuf association.

COL. I am a soldier: I also am for large populations.

LUCIE. And you, M. l’intendant?

SOUS-IN. I, madame, am a bachelor.

COL [joking] More shame for you!

BRIGNAC [also joking] It’s a scandal, monsieur, a perfect
scandal.

MME. CHEV. You don’t regret it?

SOUS-IN. Ah, I don’t say that, madame.

BRIGNAC [to the three mayors] You have heard, messieurs
les maires: commerce and the army require the
increase of the population, and the Government commands
you, therefore, to further this end to the best of
your ability, each one of you in his own commune.

The three mayors seem annoyed. They look at one another.

PIERRE [nervelessly] All right, M. le sous-préfet.

LAUR [in the same tone] I’ll mention it.

JACQUES [the same] I’ll think it over.

BRIGNAC. Oh, but gentlemen, I want something more
definite than that. I am a man of action: I am not to be
put off with words. ‘Acta non verba.’ May I depend on
you to set to work?

LAUR. You see, M. le sous-préfet, this’ll take a bit of
thinking over.

JACQUES. Don’t be in a hurry.

BRIGNAC. We must be men of action. M. Pierre Poiret,
now is your chance, won’t you give them a lead?

PIERRE. Me—M. le sous-préfet?

BRIGNAC. Yes, you, M. le maire!

29

PIERRE. No—oh, no—not me. If you knew—no—not
me. [Pointing to his neighbor] My brother, Jacques Poiret:
he’s your man. Ask Jacques, M. le sous-préfet, he
can’t refuse. But me—not me!

BRIGNAC. Then it is to be you, M. Jacques Poiret?

JACQUES. If they want to start an association in my
commune, M. le sous-préfet, they must get Thierry to
see to it.

BRIGNAC. Who is Thierry?

JACQUES. My opponent at the next election.

BRIGNAC. Why?

JACQUES. Why—if he goes in for this I’m certain to
get in. But about the next commune, I can’t understand
why my brother Pierre won’t.

PIERRE. Me?

JACQUES. Yes, you’re the very man.

BRIGNAC. Why?

JACQUES. Why? Because he has eight children.

BRIGNAC. You, M. Pierre Poiret, you have eight children,
and you said nothing about it! Let these ladies
congratulate you.

PIERRE [resisting] It’s not civil, M. le sous-préfet, it’s
not civil.

BRIGNAC. What d’you mean?

PIERRE. When you ask people to dinner it’s not to
make fun of them.

BRIGNAC. But I’m not making fun of you.

PIERRE. You’d be the first that didn’t. I can’t help it!
It’s real bad luck, that’s what it is. But it’s no reason
why I should always be made fun of.

BRIGNAC. But—

PIERRE. Yes, it’s always the same. In my commune—

BRIGNAC [interrupting] But I assure you—

PIERRE. In my commune they’re always joking about
me. They say ‘Hey, Pierre Poiret, there’s a prize for the
twelfth!’ Or they say ‘Pierre Poiret’—and there isn’t
a single day they don’t say it, and everyone thinks it’s30
funny, and they split with laughing—they say ‘Pierre
Poiret’—only—hum—not before the ladies. [Jacques
Poiret is holding his sides] Just look at that fool! I’m
sure he brought the talk round to that a’ purpose.

BRIGNAC. No, no.

PIERRE. I bet you he did. Whenever we’re in company
it’s the same thing. I won’t go about with him any
more.

BRIGNAC. But your position is most honorable.

PIERRE. And the worst of it is that he’s right. I call
myself a fool myself when I’m alone. [Jacques Poiret
goes on laughing] Look at him—grinning—look!—because
he’s only got two. [To his brother] You puppy!

COL [to Pierre Poiret] You deserve the greatest credit,
M. Pierre Poiret.

BRIGNAC. You do.

CHEV. You do, indeed, monsieur.

COL [to Pierre Poiret] In comparing your conduct
with your brother’s all men of real worth will blame him
and congratulate you, as I do, most sincerely. [He shakes
him by the hand].

CHEV [to Pierre Poiret] Bravo, monsieur! You are
helping us in our great work. [He shakes him by the
hand].

JACQUES [looking at his brother] They seem as if they
meant it!

BRIGNAC [to Jacques Poiret] You, monsieur, have
chosen the easier and more agreeable life; don’t be surprised
if we look upon your brother as the more meritorious,
though you may be cleverer.

PIERRE [striking his thigh] That’s the talk. [To his
brother] Put that in your pipe, M. Jacques.

JACQUES. All right. You are the most meritorious. Is
that what you’re going to pay your baker with?

PIERRE. Shut up! I’m the best citizen! I’m the most
meritorious!

JACQUES. H’m—yes. What does that bring you in?

31

SOUS-IN. I will tell you that, monsieur. It brings
in to your brother, as the poet says, ‘The joy of duty
done.’

JACQUES. H’m. That won’t put butter on his bread.

SOUS-IN. That is true. But one can’t have everything.

PIERRE [to Brignac, pointing to his brother] He’s right,
monsieur. For the once that I’ve been complimented,
I’ve had to go through some bad times.

BRIGNAC. You mustn’t think of that.

PIERRE. Oh—mustn’t I? Go along! He’s right.

BRIGNAC. He’s not.

PIERRE. Yes, he is.

CHEV. and COL. No, no.

PIERRE. Yes, he is.

BRIGNAC. No. It’s possible that some people might
think so now; but in ten years the tables will be turned.
He may die lonely, while you will have a happy old age
with your children and your grandchildren.

PIERRE. Perhaps it was like that once; but nowadays
as soon as the children can get along by themselves, off
they go!

CHEV. Even so they will send you help if you need it.

JACQUES. They couldn’t help him, even if they wanted
to.

COL. Why not?

JACQUES. Because as there were eight he couldn’t do
anything for them, so they’ll only be struggling, hand-to-mouth
creatures; not earning enough to keep themselves,
much less help him.

PIERRE. And he’s been able to bring up his well. He’s
only one girl: he gave her a fortune and she made a fine
marriage. He’s only one boy: he was able to send him
to Grignon and he’ll earn big money like his father. No:
it’s no use your talking. They’re right when they say
’Well, Poiret,’—h’m—not before the ladies.

He goes to the table, pours himself out a glass of cognac
and drinks it.

32

COL. I regret to say we have become too far-seeing a
nation. Everyone thinks of his own future: no one
thinks of the good of the community.

BRIGNAC. In former times people troubled less about
the future. They had faith, and remembered the words
of the Scriptures, ‘Consider the lilies of the field, how
they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: and yet
I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was
not arrayed like one of these.’

LUCIE. And yet there are little children going about
in rags.

SOUS-IN. God must be less interested in them than in
the lilies of the field.

COL [to Jacques Poiret] But, monsieur, you need
hands, too, in harvest-time.

JACQUES. I have a cutting-and-binding machine. It
does the work of twelve men, and only cost a thousand
francs. A child costs more.

CHEV. We must have workmen to make machines.

JACQUES. We buy the machines ready-made in America
much cheaper than we can make them in France.

CHEV. If there were a greater number of workmen we
might cut down wages and produce at lower prices.

JACQUES. Cut down wages! The workmen are complaining
already that they can’t live on their wages.

CHEV. Bah! give them twenty francs a day, and they’ll
still complain.

SOUS-IN. You have not tried that yet.

COL. My dear fellow, remember that, as a bachelor,
you are out of this discussion.

SOUS-IN. I withdraw.

CHEV. I didn’t mean that for you, Laurent. [To the
Colonel] M. Laurent, the mayor of Ste. Geneviève, was
formerly a workman of mine, but he came into a little
money, and went back to his native place. [To Laurent]
No—I didn’t mean it for you; but they’re not all like
you, you know.

33

BRIGNAC [to Laurent] So you refuse to form an association
too?

LAUR. Refuse, M. le sous-préfet? No.

BRIGNAC. At last! Here’s a mayor who understands
his duties. He’ll start the thing among his people, and
before long we shall have the commune of Ste. Geneviève
setting an example to the whole of France.

LAUR. Don’t get that into your head, monsieur; you’ll
be disappointed.

BRIGNAC. No, no.

LAUR. Whether you form your association or don’t
form your association, the people at home are too sensible
to have more children than they’ve cradles for.
They know too well they must put a bit by.

BRIGNAC. If you think that an association will make
no difference why do you agree to form one?

LAUR. Because I want you to get me what you promised
me.

BRIGNAC. What was that?

LAUR. You know.

BRIGNAC. No, I don’t.

Laurent touches his buttonhole.

BRIGNAC [angrily] Is that what we’ve come to? We
were speaking of the good of the community.

CHEV [the same] It’s most discouraging. We point
out to you that the trade of the country is in danger.

BRIGNAC. And you only think of yourself.

CHEV. You only think of yourself.

BRIGNAC. What a want of public spirit!

CHEV. Bad citizenship!

LAUR [getting excited] Oh, yes! Making the poor do
everything! Go and talk to the middle classes, who’ve
money enough to rear children by the dozen, and
who’ve fewer than the workmen. Here’s M. Chevillot:
he has twenty thousand francs a year, I have two thousand.
When he has ten children, then I’ll have one.
That’ll be fair and square, won’t it now?

34

CHEV. These personalities—

LAUR. Is it true that you’ve only one son?

CHEV. It’s true. But if I had several my works would
have to be sold at my death, and—

LAUR. There we are. These gentlemen are too precious
careful about the fortunes they leave their own
children; but when it’s a question of the workmen’s
children, they think it don’t matter if there ain’t enough
victuals to go round.

CHEV. It is to the interest of the workmen that my
works should be prosperous.

LAUR. But you only take unmarried men.

CHEV. I beg your pardon—I—

LAUR. Is it true?

CHEV. It’s because of the Employers’ Liability Bill.
Let me explain—[Laurent turns his back on him. He
addresses himself to Brignac] Allow me to—[Brignac
does not listen. To the sous-intendant] If I was allowed
to explain you would understand. I’m perfectly consistent.

LAUR. Are we to do as you say, or are we to do as you
do? If you believed what you say you’d act accordingly.

CHEV. But—

BRIGNAC. We shouldn’t indulge in these personalities.
We must look higher. Lift up your hearts. Sursum
corda. You have just heard, gentlemen, that commerce
and the army protest against the decline of the
population. And I, the representative of the Government
of this country, tell you, in concert with commerce
and the army, that there must be more births.

LAUR. And what’s the Government doing?

BRIGNAC. What is it doing!—well—and this circular?

SOUS-IN. We must be just. Besides this circular, the
Government has appointed a Commission to enquire
into the matter.

BRIGNAC. Various measures are being brought up.

LAUR. When they’re passed—we’ll see.

35

BRIGNAC. Those who have a large family will be exempted
from taxation.

LAUR. From what taxes?

BRIGNAC. What taxes! The taxes you pay to the collector,
of course.

LAUR. Listen, M. le sous-préfet. The poor pay next
to nothing of those taxes. They pay the real taxes: the
taxes upon bread, wine, salt, tobacco: and they’ll go on
paying them. The more children you have, the more
money the State takes from you.

SOUS-IN. Pray do not forget that the State proposes
to confer a decoration upon every mother of seven children.

PIERRE [to Laurent] There you are!

JACQUES. M. le sous-préfet, we must be off. We’ve a
long way to go.

BRIGNAC [to Jacques] Good night, M. le maire.

PIERRE [tipsy] I’m all right here. Why go ’way?

LAUR. I’m a fool, M. Brignac. I’m afraid I’ve been
setting you against me. I’ll start an association—trust
me. Good night. Good night, madame.

JACQUES. Good night, madame.

LUCIE. Good night, good night.

PIERRE. Good night, ladies, gents, and—hic—the
company.

They go out, accompanied by Brignac.

COL [to Lucie and Madame Chevillot] I’m afraid we’ve
bored you, ladies, with our discussion.

LUCIE. Not at all.

COL. I notice that women are usually a little impatient
if we talk of these questions.

SOUS-IN. As impatient as we should be if they discussed
the recruiting laws without consulting us.

MME. CHEV. Precisely.

COL [to Lucie] Perhaps, too, you don’t agree with us.

LUCIE. You’ll never make women understand why
children must be created to be killed in your battles.

36

COL [to the sous-intendant] There, that’s how the military
ruin of a country is brought about.

SOUS-IN. You’re right, colonel, if it be true that power
is a function of number.

COL. Well, isn’t it?

SOUS-IN. Those who believe the contrary say ‘There
is no evidence in history that supremacy, even military
supremacy, has ever belonged to the most numerous
peoples.’ I quote M. de Varigny. General von der Gotz
shares this opinion, and our own General Serval says,
’All great military operations have been performed by
small armies.’

Brignac comes in.

COL. Oh, ho, Mr. Bachelor, you’ve got all the arguments
on your side at your finger-ends.

BRIGNAC. We shall make laws against you and your
like, M. le sous-intendant. We shall make it impossible
for you to receive money by will, as the Romans did. We
shall make you pay fines, as the Greeks did. And we’ll
invent something new, if necessary.

SOUS-IN. Compulsory paternity!

COL. One may fairly ask whether people have the
right to shirk these obligations.

SOUS-IN. Some people think it is their duty.

BRIGNAC. Their duty!

SOUS-IN. Are you sure that all men who don’t marry
are bachelors from pure selfishness?

COL. Of course, we’re not speaking of you personally.

SOUS-IN. Do so, by all means. It was not out of mere
lightness of heart that I deprived myself of the tenderness
of a wife and the caresses of a child. When I was
young I was poor and sickly. I did not choose to bring
children into the world when I had nothing to leave
them but my bad constitution. I said, in the words of
a great poet:




Remain
In the elusive realm of might-have-been,
O son more loved than any ever born!


37

I thought it better to be lonely than let the stock go
from bad to worse. I believe it is a crime to bring a child
into the world if one cannot give it health and bring it
up well. We saw one hundred conscripts this morning,
colonel, and we passed sixty. Would it not have been
better if there had only been eighty and we could have
passed them all?

COL. Perhaps you are right. I said what I said because
I’ve heard it so constantly repeated.

SOUS-IN. When there are healthy houses and food and
clothing for everyone it will be time to think of adding
to the number.

LUCIE. That is very true.

CHEV. You evidently don’t share M. Brignac’s ideas,
madame.

BRIGNAC. Oh, indeed she does. Madame Brignac and
I have three children, and we don’t mean to stop there:
so my wife may qualify for that decoration some day.

LUCIE [to Chevillot] As far as I can see, M. le maire,
when children are born now society does not always
make them welcome.

BRIGNAC. I think, my dear, that you had better leave
the discussion of this important question to the gentlemen.

LUCIE. But surely it has some interest for us women!
I hear everyone else consulted about it—political people
and business people—but nobody ever thinks of consulting
us.

BRIGNAC. Far from not welcoming the children that
are born, society—

LUCIE [to Brignac] Stop! Do you remember what
happened lately, not a hundred miles from here? I
mean about the servant who was turned out into the
street because she was going to have a baby. She will
have to go to some hospital for her confinement. And
after that what will happen to her and her child?

BRIGNAC [to the others] Madame Brignac speaks of38
something which took place recently in a most respectable
family. The incident has nothing whatever to do
with the principles we are defending. It is clear that one
cannot have a servant in that condition in a well-kept
house. And there are higher considerations which will
always prevent a respectable citizen from even appearing
to condone immorality by sheltering it. One must
not offer a premium to evil-doing.

CHEV. Very true.

LUCIE. And the unfortunate girl, who is very likely
only the victim of another person, is condemned by
everyone.

BRIGNAC [timidly] No, no, I don’t say that. I myself
am very liberal, and I confess that in—exceptional circumstances—one
should be indulgent to her.

LUCIE. Very well. Don’t forget you have said that.

COL. Good night, madame. I must be going. Thank
you for a charming evening.

CHEV. I also, madame—charming.

BRIGNAC [pointing to the door into his office] This way.
As you go out I want to shew you a diagram I have had
done, by which you can make yourself acquainted at a
single glance with the political conditions of the division.
There is an arrangement of pins—[They hesitate].
One minute. It will only take a minute. You can go
out through the office. One minute—while you are putting
on your coats. The coats are in there. I’m going
out with you to a reception at the club. You’ll see—it’s
rather curious. [To Lucie, aside] You come too.
[Aloud] I think the idea is ingenious.

[He talks them all off. When they are gone there is a
short pause, and then Catherine opens the door at the
back and steps forward.]

CATHERINE [to Annette, who has come into the anteroom]
Yes, mademoiselle, they are all gone.

[Annette comes in. She takes off her hat and cloak and
hands them to Catherine, who takes them into the anteroom39
and comes back to turn out the principal electric lights and
to take away the tray. Annette, with fixed, staring eyes,
sits rigidly upon the couch. Lucie comes in.]

LUCIE. Annette! Where have you been?

ANNETTE. I have been to see Jacques Bernin.

LUCIE. You have seen him? You have spoken to
him?

ANNETTE. I went to his father’s house.

LUCIE. Well?

ANNETTE. There is no hope.

LUCIE. What did they say to you?

ANNETTE. I oughtn’t ever to tell anyone about the
two hours I have just lived through. It’s too shameful.
Too vile. What I can’t believe is that all that really happened
to me, and that I am alive still.

LUCIE [tenderly] Tell me all about it.

ANNETTE. What’s the good of my telling you? It’s
all over. There’s nothing left. He didn’t love me: he
never loved me. He’s gone. He’s going to marry another
woman.

LUCIE. He’s gone?

ANNETTE. He went this evening. They all went. M.
and Madame Bernin and Gabrielle dined at the station;
Jacques dined at a restaurant with some friends. I went
there. I sent up for him. From where I was standing, in
the vestibule, I heard their jokes when the waiter gave
him my message.

LUCIE [in gentle reproach] Annette!

ANNETTE. I wanted to know. I was certain his people
were taking him away by force, and I was making excuses
for him. I was certain he loved me. I should have
laughed if anyone had told me he wouldn’t be horrified
when he heard what had happened to me. I thought
that when he knew, he’d take my hand, and go with
me to his people, and say ‘Whether you wish it or not,
here is my wife.’ As I was sure it would end like that, I
thought it was better it should be over at once. I ex40pected
to come back here to beg your pardon—to kiss
you and comfort you.

LUCIE. And what did he say?

ANNETTE [without listening] I think I’ve gone mad.
All that happened, and I’m here. I’m quiet: I’m not
crying: it’s as if I was paralysed.

LUCIE. You said you sent a message to him at the
restaurant?

ANNETTE. Yes.

LUCIE. Did he come?

ANNETTE. Yes. He said he thought some chorus-girl
wanted him.

LUCIE. Oh! And when he found it was you?

ANNETTE. He took me out into the street for fear I
should be recognized, and I had to explain it to him in
the street. [A pause]. People passing by stared at us,
and some of them laughed. [With passion and pain]
Oh! if I only had no memory!

LUCIE. Tell me, darling, tell me.

ANNETTE [with violence] Oh, I’ll tell you. You’ll despise
me a little more; but what can that matter to me
now? First he pretended not to understand me: he
forced me to say it quite plainly: he did it on purpose—either
to torture me, or to give himself time to think.
You’ll never guess what he said—that it wasn’t true.

LUCIE. Oh!

ANNETTE. Yes, that it wasn’t true. He got angry, and
he began to abuse me. He said he guessed what I was
up to; that I wanted to make a scandal to force him to
marry me—oh, he spared me nothing—to force him to
marry me because he was rich. And when that made
me furious, he threatened to call the police! I ought to
have left him, run away, come home, oughtn’t I? But I
couldn’t believe it of him all at once, like that! And I
couldn’t go away while I had any hope. You see, as long
as I was with him, nothing was settled: as long as I was
holding to his arm it was as if I was engaged. When he41
was gone I should only be a miserable ruined girl, like
dozens of others. Then—I was afraid of making him
angry: my life was at stake: and to save myself I went
down into the very lowest depths of vileness and cowardice.
I cried, I implored. I lost all shame and I offered
to go with him to a doctor to-morrow to prove that
what I told him was true. And what he said then I cannot
tell you—not even you—it was too much—too much—I
didn’t understand at first. It was only afterwards,
coming back, going over all his words, that I made out
what he meant. He didn’t believe what he said. He
couldn’t have believed what he said. At any rate he
knows that I am not a girl out of the streets. But at
first I didn’t understand. Then—where was I? I don’t
remember—At last he looked at his watch and said
he had only just time to catch the train. He said good-bye
and started off at a great pace to the station. I followed
him imploring and crying. I was so ashamed of
my cowardice. It was horrible and absurd! I couldn’t
believe it was the end of everything. I was all out of
breath—almost running—and I prayed him for the sake
of his child, for the sake of my love, of my misery, of my
very life; and I took hold of his arm to keep him back.
My God! what must I have looked like! At the station
entrance he said, ‘Let go your hold of me.’ I said, ‘You
shall not go.’ Then he rushed to the train, and jumped
into a carriage, and almost crushed my fingers in the
door; and he went and hid behind his mother, and she
threatened too to have me arrested. And Gabrielle sat
there looking white and pretending not to know me. I
came back. I haven’t had courage enough to kill myself,
but I wish I was dead! [Breaking into sobs, and in a voice
of earnest supplication] Lucie, dear, I don’t want to go
through all that’s coming—I’m too little, I’m too weak,
I’m too young to bear it. Really, I haven’t the strength.

LUCIE. Annette—don’t say that. Hush, my darling,
hush. In the first place, everything hasn’t been tried.42
You have entreated these people; now we must threaten.

ANNETTE. It’ll be no use.

LUCIE. It will be of use. The way they’re hurrying
away shews how afraid they are of scandal. As soon as
my husband comes in I will tell him all about it.

ANNETTE. Oh, my God!

LUCIE. He will go down and see them. He will threaten
them with an action. They will give in.

ANNETTE. We can’t bring an action against them. He
told me so.

LUCIE. Then there are other ways of defending you.
Believe me, I’m sure of it.

ANNETTE. There are not.

LUCIE. There are. And even if there weren’t, you
mustn’t talk of dying at your age. Am I not here?
Annette, Annette, my little one, I will help you through
this trouble! You believe me, don’t you? You know
how I love you? You know that mother left you in my
care? I’ll help you and comfort you and love you so well
that you’ll forget.

ANNETTE. Forget!

LUCIE. Yes, yes; people forget. If it weren’t for that
no one would be alive.

ANNETTE. I feel as if I had lived a hundred years.
Life is hard, hard; too hard.

LUCIE. Life is hard for all women.

ANNETTE. It’s worse for me than for anyone else.

LUCIE. Oh, Annette! If you only knew!

ANNETTE. When I’ve seen mothers with their little
children I’ve had such dreams.

LUCIE. If you only knew! Those mothers had their
own troubles. Nearly every woman carries about with
her the corpse of the woman she might have been.

ANNETTE. Ah, Lucie, dear, it’s easy for you to talk.

LUCIE. Darling, you mustn’t think you’re alone in
your sorrow. I seem to you to be happy with my children
and my husband, and you think my happiness43
makes light of your distress. But you’re wrong. Your
misery makes me so weak, I must tell you what I wanted
always to hide from you. My husband does not love me.
I don’t love him. Can you realize the loneliness of that?
If you knew what it means to live with an enemy and to
have to endure his caresses!

ANNETTE. My poor dear!

LUCIE. So you see, Annette, you mustn’t think about
dying, because perhaps I shall want your help as much
as you want mine. I heard the door shut. It’s Julien.

ANNETTE. Don’t tell him: please don’t. Spare me the
shame.

LUCIE. Go away, now.

ANNETTE. You’ve given me back a little hope. Dearest
sister help me, I have nobody else.

LUCIE. Go!

She goes: Brignac comes in.

BRIGNAC [making for the door of his office] Not gone
to bed yet? I had a stroke of luck at the club. I met
the editor of the ‘Independent’ and I promised to write
him an article about the minister’s circular for to-morrow’s
paper. An official’s day is sometimes pretty full,
eh?

LUCIE. Julien, I have something very important to tell
you. A great misfortune has happened to us.

BRIGNAC. Good heavens, what is it? The children?

LUCIE. No, it has to do with Annette.

BRIGNAC. You said she didn’t come to dinner because
of a headache. Have you been concealing something?

LUCIE. She is not ill, but she is cruelly and grievously
unhappy.

BRIGNAC. Nonsense! Unhappiness at her age! A love
affair. Some marriage she had set her heart on.

LUCIE. Yes, a marriage she had set her heart on.

BRIGNAC. Ouf! I breathe again. What a fright you
gave me! That’s not of much consequence.

LUCIE. Yes, it’s of the greatest consequence. Julien,44
I appeal to your heart, to your kindliness, to your best
feelings.

BRIGNAC. But what’s the matter?

LUCIE. Annette made the mistake of trusting entirely
to the man she loved, who had promised to marry her.
He took advantage of the child’s innocent love. She
has been seduced. [In a low voice] Understand me,
Julien, she’s going to have a baby in six months.

BRIGNAC. Annette!

LUCIE. Annette.

BRIGNAC. It’s impossible. It’s—

LUCIE. She is certain of it. She told me about it herself.

BRIGNAC [after a silence] Who is it?

LUCIE. Jacques Bernin.

BRIGNAC [furious] Jacques Bernin! Well, this is a
nice piece of work! She goes it, this little sister of
yours, with her innocent airs!

LUCIE. Don’t accuse her. Don’t.

BRIGNAC. I really cannot compliment her! I’m nicely
repaid for all I’ve done for her, and you may thank her
from me for her gratitude.

LUCIE. Oh, don’t be angry.

BRIGNAC. Well, if you are able to hear news like this
perfectly calmly, you are certainly endowed with unusual
self-control.

LUCIE. It was the child’s innocence that made the
thing possible.

BRIGNAC. I daresay. Go and tell that to the Châteauneuf
people! Besides, if she was so innocent, why didn’t
you look after her better?

LUCIE. But it was you who were always urging her to
go to the Bernins.

BRIGNAC. In another minute it’s going to be all my
fault! I was glad she should go to their house because I
thought old Bernin might be useful to us. How should
I know that the girl couldn’t behave herself?

45

LUCIE [indignantly] Oh, hush! I tell you Annette is
the victim of this wretch. If you are going to do nothing
but insult her, we had better stop discussing the matter.

BRIGNAC. I’m in a nice fix now! There’s nothing left
for us but to pack our trunks and be off. I’m done for,
ruined! smashed!

LUCIE. You exaggerate.

BRIGNAC. I exaggerate! I tell you if she was caught red-handed
stealing, the wreck wouldn’t be more complete.
I even think that would have been better. I should be
less definitely compromized, and less disqualified.

LUCIE. You can abuse her by and by: the business
now is to save her. The Bernins have gone away this
evening; find them to-morrow; and, if you speak to
them as you ought, they’ll understand that their son
must marry Annette.

BRIGNAC. But Jacques Bernin is engaged.

LUCIE. He must break it off, that’s all.

BRIGNAC. He won’t break it off, because it means lots
and lots of money, and because he is the most ferocious
little fortune-hunter I ever met. Yes, he is; I know
him, I see him at the club. I’ve heard him holding forth
about women and money; his opinions are edifying. By
the way, has Annette any letters from him connecting
him with this business?

LUCIE. No.

BRIGNAC. He’s not such a fool as to compromize himself.
He’ll deny everything.

LUCIE. You must threaten them with a scandal.

BRIGNAC. We should be the first to suffer from that.

LUCIE. But we must do something. We must bring
an action.

BRIGNAC. There is no affiliation law in France.

LUCIE. You refuse to go and see what can be done with
the Bernins?

BRIGNAC. Not at all. I say that it would be a useless
journey.

46

LUCIE. Then what are we to do?

BRIGNAC. Not a soul in Châteauneuf must know what
has happened. Fortunately we have a little time.

LUCIE. What are you going to do?

BRIGNAC. We’ll see. We’ll think it over. One doesn’t
come to a decision of this importance in ten minutes.

LUCIE. I want to know what you are going to do. Your
point of view surprises me so much that I wish to understand
it completely.

BRIGNAC. Understand this, then: if the matter is kept
secret, it is only our misfortune; if it becomes public, it
will be a scandal.

LUCIE. How can it be kept secret?

BRIGNAC. We must pack Annette off before anyone
suspects.

LUCIE. Where is she to go?

BRIGNAC. Ah! that’s the devil. Where—where? If
only we had some friends we could trust, in some out-of-the-way
place, far away. But we haven’t. Still, we
must send her somewhere.

LUCIE. Oh, my God! [She sobs].

BRIGNAC [irritated] For Heaven’s sake don’t cry like
that. That doesn’t mend matters. We must make some
excuse. We’ll invent an aunt or a cousin who’s invited
her to stay. I will find a decent house in Paris for her
to go to. She’ll be all right there. When the time comes
she can put the child out to nurse in the country, and
come back to us. I shall certainly have got my promotion
by that time: we shall have left this place, and the
situation will be saved—as far as it can be saved.

LUCIE. You propose that to me and you think I shall
consent to it!

BRIGNAC. Why not?

LUCIE. You’ve not stopped to think. That’s your only
excuse.

BRIGNAC. I must say, I don’t see—

LUCIE. You seriously propose to send that poor child47
to Paris, where she doesn’t know a soul?

BRIGNAC. What do you mean by that? I will go to
Paris myself, if necessary. There are special boarding-houses:
very respectable ones. I’ll inquire: of course
without letting out that it is for anyone I know. And
I’ll pay what is necessary. What more can you want?
We shall be sure of keeping the thing quiet that way.
I believe there are houses in Paris subsidized by the
State, and the people who stay in them need not even
give their names.

LUCIE. I tell you, you’ve not stopped to think. Just
when the child is most in need of every care, you propose
to send her off alone; alone, do you understand,
alone! To tear her away from here, put her into a train,
and send her off to Paris, like a sick animal you want
to get rid of. It would be enough to make her kill herself.

BRIGNAC. Can you think of anything better?

LUCIE. Everything is better than that. If I consented
to that I should feel that I was as bad as the man who
seduced her. Be honest, Julien: remember it is in our
interest you propose to sacrifice her. We shall gain
peace and quiet at the price of her loneliness and despair.
To save ourselves trouble—serious trouble, I admit—we
are to abandon this child to strangers. She
does not know the meaning of harshness or unkindness;
and we are to drive her away now—now, of all times!
Away from all love and care and comfort, without a
friend to put kind arms round her and let her sob her
grief away. I implore you, Julien, I entreat you, for our
children’s sake, don’t keep me from her, don’t ask me to
do this shameful thing. I will not do it! We must do
something else. Make me suffer if you like, but don’t
add abandonment and loneliness to the misery of my
poor little helpless sister.

BRIGNAC. There would have been no question of misery
if she had behaved herself.

48

LUCIE. She is this man’s victim! But she won’t go.
You’ll have to drive her out as you drove out the servant.
Have you the courage? Just think of what her life
will be. Try to realize the long months of waiting in
that dreadful house: the slow development of the poor
little creature that she will know beforehand is condemned
to all the risks children run when they are separated
from their mothers. And when she is torn with
tortures, and cries out in that fearful anguish I know so
well, and jealous death seems to be hovering over the
bed of martyrdom, waiting for mother and child; just
when one is overcome by the terror and amazement
of the mystery accomplished in oneself; then, then—there’ll
be only strangers with her. And if her poor anguished
eyes look round for an answering look, perhaps
the last; if she feels for a hand to cling to; she will see
round her bed only men doing a duty, and women going
through a routine. And then—after that—she’s to let
her child go; to stifle her strongest instinct; to silence
the cry of love that consoles us all for the tortures we
have to go through; to turn away her eyes and say
’Take him away, I don’t want him.’ And at that price
she’s to be forgiven for another person’s crime!

BRIGNAC. But what can I do? I can’t alter the world,
can I? The world is made like that. If Annette was ten
times more innocent she couldn’t stay here.

LUCIE. I—

BRIGNAC [violently] And I don’t choose that she shall
stay here. Do you understand? I’m sorry she has to go
by herself to Paris. But once more, if she had behaved
respectably she wouldn’t be obliged to do it.

LUCIE. Oh!

BRIGNAC. Can’t you understand that she would suffer
much more here, surrounded by people who know her,
than she would there, where she would be unknown?
Here she couldn’t so much as go down the street without
exposing herself to insult. Why, if she even went49
to mass or to a concert after her condition became evident,
it would be a kind of provocation; people would
avoid her as if she had the plague. Mothers would
sneer and tell their daughters not to look at her, and
men would smile in a way that would be an outrage.

LUCIE. If necessary she can stay at home.

BRIGNAC. Stay at home! Rubbish! What would be
the good of that? Servants would talk, and the scandal
would be all the greater. And you haven’t reflected
that the consequences would fall upon me. You haven’t
troubled to consider me, or to remember the drawback
this will be to me. I am not alluding to the imbecile
jokes people are sure to make about the apostle of repopulation.
But our respectability will be called in
question. People will remark that there are families in
which such things don’t happen. Political hatred and
social prejudice will help them to invent all sorts of tales.
And the allusions, the suggestions, the pretended pity!
There would be nothing left for me but to send in my
resignation!

LUCIE. Send it in.

BRIGNAC. Yes, and what should we live upon then?

LUCIE [after a silence] Then that is society’s welcome
to the newborn child!

BRIGNAC. To the child born outside marriage, yes. If
it wasn’t for that there would soon be nothing but illegitimate
births. It is to preserve the family that society
condemns the natural child.

LUCIE. If there is guilt two people are guilty. Why do
you only punish the mother?

BRIGNAC. What am I to say to you? Because it’s easier.

LUCIE. And that’s your justice! The truth is, you all
uphold the conventions of society. You do. And the
proof is that if Annette stayed here in the town to have
her baby, you’d all cry shame upon her; but if she goes
to Paris and has it secretly and gets rid of it, nobody
will blame her. Let’s be honest, and call things by50
their names: it is not immorality that is condemned,
but motherhood. You say you want a larger number
of births, and at the same time you say to women ‘No
motherhood without marriage, and no marriage without
money.’ As long as you’ve not changed that all your
circulars will be met with shouts of derision—half from
hate, half from pity!

BRIGNAC. Possibly. Good night. I’m going to work.

LUCIE. Listen—Then you drive Annette from your
house?

BRIGNAC. I don’t drive her from my house. I beg her
to go elsewhere.

LUCIE. I shall go with her.

BRIGNAC. You mean, leave me?

LUCIE. Yes.

BRIGNAC. Then you don’t love me.

LUCIE. No.

BRIGNAC. Ah! Here’s another story. Since when?

LUCIE. I never loved you.

BRIGNAC. You married me.

LUCIE. Not for love.

BRIGNAC. This is most interesting. Go on.

LUCIE. You’re another victim of the state of society
you are defending.

BRIGNAC. I don’t understand.

LUCIE. I was a penniless girl, and so I had no offers
of marriage. When you proposed to me I was tired of
waiting, and I didn’t want to be an old maid. I accepted
you, but I knew you only came to me because the women
with money wouldn’t have you. I made up my
mind to love you and be loyal.

BRIGNAC. Well?

LUCIE. But when my first baby came you deceived
me. Since then I have only endured you, and you owe
my submission to my cowardice. It was only my first
child I wanted, the others you forced upon me, and
when each was coming you left me. It’s true I was un51attractive,
but that was not my fault. You left me day
after day in my ugliness and loneliness, and when you
came back to me from those other women, you were full
of false solicitude about my health. I begged for a rest
after nursing. I asked to be allowed to live a little for
myself, to be a mother only with my own consent. You
laughed at me in a vain, foolish way. You did not consider
the future of your children or the life of your wife,
but you forced upon me the danger and the suffering of
bringing another child into the world. What was it to
you? Just the satisfaction of your vanity. You could
jest with your friends and make coarse witticisms about
it. Fool!

BRIGNAC. That’s enough, thank you. You’re my wife—

LUCIE. I’ll not be your wife any longer, and I won’t
have another child.

BRIGNAC. Why?

LUCIE. Because I’ve just found out what the future
of my poor, penniless little girls is to be. It’s to be
Annette’s fate, or mine. Oh, to think I’ve been cruel
enough to bring three of them into the world already!

BRIGNAC. You’re mad. And be good enough not to
put on these independent airs. They’re perfectly useless.

LUCIE. You think so?

BRIGNAC. I am sure of it. If you have had enough of
me, get a divorce.

LUCIE. But you would keep the children?

BRIGNAC. Naturally. And let me tell you that as long
as you are my wife before the world, you’ll be my wife
really.

LUCIE. And you will force me to have a child whenever
you please?

BRIGNAC. Most certainly.

LUCIE. My God! They think a woman’s body is like
the clay of the fields; they want to drag harvest after
harvest from it until it is worn out and done for! I re52fuse
this slavery, and I shall leave you if you turn out
my sister.

BRIGNAC. And your children?

LUCIE. I will take them with me.

BRIGNAC. And their food?

LUCIE. I will work.

BRIGNAC. Don’t talk nonsense. You couldn’t earn
enough to keep them from starving. It’s late: go to bed.

LUCIE [her teeth clenched] And wait for you?

BRIGNAC. And wait for me. Precisely. [He goes out].

LUCIE [rushing to the door on the left] Annette! Oh,
Annette! There’s nobody to help us!

ACT III

[A court house, of which only two sides are visible.
The footlights would almost correspond with a line drawn
from one angle to the opposite one. On the left to the front
is the raised seat of the public Minister. Further back,
to the left, the court. Facing the audience, successively,
counsels’ bench; the defendants’ bench, a little raised;
and the police bench.

[In the centre, facing the table on which lie the ‘pièces
à conviction,’ is the witness-box.

[To the extreme right are three or four benches, of which
a part only is visible, reserved for the public. The jury,
which is not visible, would be in the prompter’s place.

[There are present the advocate-general: the president
of the court and his assessors; also the counsel for the
defence and some junior barristers. In the dock are Madame
Thomas, Marie Caubert, Tupin, Madame Tupin and
several policemen. Madame Chevillot is among the public.

PRESIDENT [authoritatively, to the counsel for the defence]
Maître Verdier, you cannot speak now. I see
what line you propose to take for the defence, and I
give you fair warning that I shall use my whole power
and authority to prevent you from making light of the
criminal acts attributed to the defendants.

COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE. You are mistaken, M. le
président. I have no intention of making light of them.54
On the contrary, I declare definitely that in my eyes
abortion is a crime, because it deprives of life a creature
already living; and to condone it would lead to condoning
infanticide also. But what I propose to demonstrate
is that in not permitting affiliation and in not respecting
all motherhood, whatever its origin may be, society
has lost its right to condemn a crime rendered excusable
by the hypocrisy of custom and the indifference of
the laws.

PRES. This is not the time for your address. Let the
woman Thomas stand up. [To Madame Thomas] So you
hunted up your clients in the provinces?

MME. THOMAS. No, M. le président. They came and
found me.

PRES. We shall see. Usher, bring forward the witness—[he
hunts for the name in his notes]—Madame Lucie
Brignac.

MME. CHEV [among the audience, to her neighbor]
Mustn’t Brignac be in a hurry to get his divorce!

Lucie has approached the witness-bar. She is thinner
and older.

PRES [to the usher] Has the witness been sworn?

USHER. Yes, M. le président.

PRES [to Lucie] Was it of her own free will that your
sister, the unfortunate Annette Jarras, in consequence
of whose death the defendants have been arrested,
came to Paris and placed herself in the hands of this
woman?

LUCIE. Yes, M. le président.

PRES. Very well. Go and sit down. I will call you
again presently. [Lucie retires to her place, sobbing].
Marie Caubert, come forward. [A small, thin woman
rises]. Your name is Marie Caubert? How old are you?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. Twenty-seven.

PRES. Profession?

SCH. Schoolmistress.

PRES. You have come from the country, too: do you55
know what you are accused of?

SCH. Yes, M. le président.

PRES. What have you to say in your defence?

SCH. I did not know I was doing wrong.

PRES. Your levity amazes me. You are a schoolmistress,
and you do not realize that the sacred mission
with which you are entrusted, the mission of preparing
citizens and citizenesses for the glories of the future,
demands that your life should be exemplary. You are
appointed to give the elementary course of lessons in
civic morality: is it thus that you practise that morality?
You have no answer? According to the notes I
have here you insisted upon nursing your two children
yourself. Do you love them?

SCH. It was just because I love them.

PRES. But you decided that two were enough. You
ventured to limit the work of the Creator.

SCH. I should have liked nothing better than to have
four or five children.

PRES. Indeed! Then allow me to inform you that
you’ve not taken the best means for arriving at that
desirable result. [He laughs, turning to his assessor on
the right, who laughs also].

SCH. One must have money enough to bring them up.

PRES. Ah! Stop a moment. If some people were to
make that bad excuse I might understand it. But from
you, who enjoy the inestimable advantage of being under
the protection of the State, I do not understand it.
You are never out of work.

SCH. I earn 83 francs a month, and my husband, who
teaches too, earns the same. That makes 166 francs a
month to live on and to rear two children. When there
were four of us we could just scrape along, but with five
we couldn’t have managed it.

PRES. You forget to mention that when your children
are coming you have a right to a month’s holiday on full
salary.

56

SCH. Yes, at one time, M. le président, but not now. In
1900 a ministerial circular announced to us that there
was not enough money, and we could practically only
have holidays at half salary. To get the whole salary
we must have a certificate from the inspector, giving
reasons. One has to petition for it.

PRES. Well, then one petitions.

SCH. It’s hard to seem like a beggar simply because
one has children.

PRES. Oho! You’re proud.

SCH. That’s not illegal.

PRES. And that’s why you went to the woman Thomas?

SCH. Yes, monsieur. My husband and I had arranged
our expenses carefully. On the evening of the day we
were paid our salary we used to divide the money into
little portions and put them away. So much for rent, so
much for food, so much for clothing. We just managed
to get along by being most careful; and several times we
cut down expenses it didn’t seem possible to cut down.
A third child coming upset everything. We couldn’t
have lived. We should all have starved. Besides, the
inspectors and directresses don’t like us to have many
children, especially if we nurse them ourselves. They
told me to hide myself when I was suckling the last one.
I only had ten minutes to do it in, at the recreations at
ten o’clock and at two o’clock; and when my mother
brought baby to me I had to shut myself up with him
in a dark closet.

PRES. All that’s irrelevant.

COUN. DEF. No, M. le président, it ought to be known
here how the State, which preaches increase of the population,
treats its employés when they have children.

PRES [furious] You have no right to speak. [To the
schoolmistress] Have you anything more to say?

SCH. No, M. le président.

PRES. Then sit down. Tupin, stand up.

57

TUPIN [a working man, mean and wretched] After you,
Calvon.

PRES. What! What did you say?

TUPIN. I said ‘After you, Calvon.’ Calvon’s your
name, isn’t it?

PRES. I warn you I shall not stand any insolence from
you.

TUPIN. I say to you ‘After you, Calvon,’ as you say to
me ‘Tupin, stand up.’ If that’s insolence, I didn’t begin
it.

PRES. I shall have you turned out of the court. Stand
up.

TUPIN [standing] There: I’m very glad to. It’ll take
the stiffness out of my legs.

PRES. Your profession?

TUPIN. Electrician.

PRES. You were once. It is a long time since you
worked regularly.

TUPIN. I can’t get work.

PRES. Because you look for it in the public house.
The police reports about you are most unfavorable.

TUPIN. I never liked the police: I’m not surprised
they don’t like me. [Laughter from the audience].

PRES. Silence! or I shall clear the court. [To Tupin]
The name of your wife, Eugénie Tupin, has been found
in the papers of the woman Thomas. Where is the woman
Tupin? Stand up. [To Tupin] That will do, sit
down. You attempted to conceal her from the police.

TUPIN. I thought they were not good company for her.

PRES [pretending not to hear and consulting his notes]
You gave yourself up and declared that you yourself
took her to this woman’s house.

TUPIN. You speak like a book.

PRES. You persistently accused yourself. Did you
want to go to prison?

TUPIN. It’s not a bad place. One’s warm, and there’s
food at every meal.

58

PRES. It is true that prison diet is better than your
everyday fare.

TUPIN. Now you’re talking.

PRES [consulting his notes] When you were arrested
you were both completely destitute. What remained
of your furniture had been sold, and you were entering
upon a state of complete vagabondage. No doubt you
also will accuse society. You are an unruly person. You
frequent Socialist clubs; and when you don’t affect a
cynical carelessness in your language, as you are doing
now, you like to repeat the empty phrases you have
picked up from the propagandist pamphlets which are
poisoning the minds of the working classes. But we
know all about you; and if you are a victim, you are
the victim of your vices. You drink.

TUPIN. I have taken to it lately. That’s true.

PRES. You confess it. Most extraordinary.

MME. TUPIN. What does that prove?

PRES. Your eldest daughter is on the streets and one
of your sons has been sent to prison for a year for theft.
Is that true?

TUPIN. Possibly.

PRES. Not quite so insolent now. I congratulate you.
We will proceed. You took your wife to an abortionist.
Why?

TUPIN. Because I considered that bringing seven miserable
little devils into the world was enough.

PRES. If you had continued to be the honest and laborious
workman that you once were you might have
had another child, without that child being necessarily
a miserable little devil.

MME. TUPIN. That isn’t true.

TUPIN. No, monsieur. After four it’s impossible.

PRES. I don’t understand you.

TUPIN. What I say is that a workman’s family, however
hard they work and screw, can’t get along when
there are five children.

59

PRES. If that is true there are—and this society you
despise may be proud of it—there are, I say, many
charities on the watch, so to speak, for the destitute;
and they make it a point of honor to leave none without
relief.

TUPIN [indignant] Oh, and that seems all right to you,
does it? You say it’s a workman’s duty to work and
to have a lot of children, and when he does it, fair and
square, and it makes a beggar of him, it seems to you all
right!

PRES. Ah, ha! Here’s the orator of the public house
parlor. In the first place, we have only your assertion
that a workman’s family cannot live when there are five
children. But, thank God, there are more than one or
two in that condition who have recourse neither to
charity nor to an abortionist.

MME. TUPIN. That’s not true.

TUPIN. Shall I prove to you that you’re wrong?

PRES. That has nothing to do with the charge against
you.

MME. TUPIN. Yes, it has.

TUPIN. I beg your pardon. If I prove it that will explain
how I came to do what I did.

MME. TUPIN. I should think so!

PRES. Very well, but cut it short.

TUPIN. I gave my lawyer the month’s account. Please
let him read it to you.

PRES. Very well.

The counsel for the defence rises.

COUN. Here it is.

PRES. Stop. You’re not Tupin’s counsel.

COUN. No, M. le président. But my learned friends,
with a confidence which honors me, and for which I
thank them, have begged me to take over the conduct
of the case as a whole, reserving to themselves the
right to discuss important matters affecting their several
clients.

60

PRES. Then I give you permission just to read this
document. But do not attempt to address the court.
This is not the time. You can read the paper and that
is all. Do you understand?

COUN. I perfectly understand, M. le président. [He
reads].2

[2] A shorter version of this document, for the theatre, will be found
in a note at the end.

61

MME. CHEV [to her neighbor] There were three sous a
day for tobacco that he might very well have saved.

COUN. Perhaps this document might be formally put
in evidence.

PRES. It is quite useless. [To Tupin] I am not going
to dispute your figures. I admit them, and I repeat
there are charities.

TUPIN. And I repeat that I’m not a beggar.

PRES. You prefer to commit what is almost infanticide.
A man who has a daughter on the streets and a
son a thief may accept charity without degradation.

MME. TUPIN [outraged] Oh!

TUPIN [indignant] In those days they were not what
they are now. If they fell so low it was because I had
too many children and I couldn’t look after my boy;
and because my girl was deserted and starving. But
you must be made of stone to throw that in my teeth.

PRES. And if you took to drinking it’s not your fault
either, I suppose?

TUPIN. I want to explain about that. When we began
to get short in the house my wife and I started to quarrel.
Every time a child came we were mad at making it
worse for the others. And so—I needn’t make a long
story of it—I ended up in the pub. It’s warm there,
and you can’t hear the children crying nor the mother
complaining. And besides, when you’ve drink in you
you forget.

MME. TUPIN. It’s the sort of thing that it’s good to
forget.

TUPIN. And that’s how we got poorer and poorer. My
fault if you like.

PRES. And the last child, what about that?

MME. TUPIN. Oh, the last.

TUPIN. The last? He cost us nothing.

PRES [carelessly] Eh?

MME. TUPIN. No.

TUPIN. No, he was a cripple. He was born in starva62tion,
and his mother was worn out.

PRES. And his father was a drunkard.

TUPIN. Maybe. Anyway that one, the sickly fellow,
wanted for nothing. They took him into the hospital.
They wouldn’t let me take him away.

MME. TUPIN. He was a curiosity for the doctors.

TUPIN. And they nursed him and they nursed him
and they nursed him. They didn’t leave him a minute.
They made him live in spite of himself. And they let
the other children—the strong ones—go to the bad.
With half the money and the fuss they wasted on the
cripple they could have made fine fellows of all the
others.

PRES. And was that the reason you did away with the
next?

MME. TUPIN. For all the good he’d have got out of this
world he might thank me for not letting him come into
it.

PRES. He should never have been created.

TUPIN. That’s true.

PRES. If everyone was like you the country would
soon go to the dogs. But you don’t trouble yourself
much about the country, I expect.

TUPIN. Someone said ‘A man’s country is the place
where he’s well off.’ I’m badly off everywhere.

PRES. You are perfectly indifferent to the good of
humanity.

TUPIN. Humanity had better come to an end if it
can’t get on without a set of miserable wretches like me.

PRES. The jury thoroughly appreciate your moral
sense. You can sit down.

Evening has come. The ushers bring lamps.

PRES [to Madame Tupin] Have you anything more
to say?

MME. TUPIN. I have to say that all this is not my fault.
My husband and I worked like beasts; we did without
every kind of pleasure to try and bring up our children.63
If we had wanted to slave more I declare to you we
couldn’t have done it. And now that we’ve given our
lives for them, the oldest is in hospital ruined and done
for because he worked in a ‘dangerous trade’ as they
call it!

PRES. Why didn’t you put him into something else?

MME. TUPIN. Because there’s no work anywhere else.
They’re full up everywhere else. There are too many
people in the world. My little girl is a woman now like
lots of others in Paris. She had to choose between that
and starving. She chose that. I’m only a poor woman,
and I know what it means to have nothing to eat, so I
forgave her. The worst of it is that sometimes she’s
hungry all the same.

TUPIN. And they say God blesses large families!

PRES [from his notes] Two others of your children
are dead. The two youngest are out at nurse.

MME. TUPIN. Yes. They were taken away as soon as
they were born. All I know about them is the post-office
order I send every month to the woman who’s
bringing them up. Oh, it’s cruel! It’s cruel! It’s cruel!
[She sits down].

PRES. We have now only to examine the case of Annette
Jarras. Let the woman Thomas stand up. [To
Madame Thomas] This was your victim. She was nineteen,
quite young and in perfect health. Now she is in
her grave. What have you to say?

MME. THOMAS [quietly] Nothing.

PRES. You don’t excite yourself. Oh, we know you
are not easily moved.

MME. THOMAS. If I told you that it was pity made me
do it, you wouldn’t believe me.

PRES. Probably not. But at any rate you might try.
Every accused person has a right to say whatever he
can in his own defence: of course under the control of
the president of the court.

MME. THOMAS. It isn’t worth while.

64

PRES. Oh, yes. Let us hear. The gentlemen of the
jury are listening.

MME. THOMAS [after a sign from her counsel] A girl
came to me one day; she was a servant. She had been
seduced by her master. I refused to do what she asked
me to do: she went and drowned herself. Another I
refused to help was brought up before you here for infanticide.
Then when the others came, I said Yes. I’ve
prevented many a suicide and many a crime.

PRES. So that’s your line of defence. It is in pity, in
charity, that you have acted. The prosecution will answer
that you have never failed to exact payment for
your services, and a high payment.

MME. THOMAS. And you? Don’t they pay you for condemning
other people?

PRES. Those you condemn to death and execute yourself
are all innocent.

MME. THOMAS. You prosecute me, but you decorate the
surgeons who trade in sterility.

PRES. Be silent. Sit down. Madame Lucie Brignac.
[Lucie comes forward, in great emotion]. Calm yourself,
madame, and tell us what you know. You are called for
the defence.

LUCIE. It was I, monsieur, who asked to be heard.

PRES. Speak up, madame, I cannot hear what you say.

LUCIE [louder] It was I, monsieur, who asked to be
heard. I wanted to defend the memory of my little one.
I fear now I shall not have the strength. [She controls
herself]. Annette was seduced by a man who had promised
to marry her. She lived with us. When my husband
knew that my sister was in a certain condition, he
wished to send her away. I was indignant, and I left his
house with her and my children. We went to Bordeaux.
We had a few hundred francs, and we thought we could
work for our living. [She stops].

PRES. Well?

LUCIE. Our money was soon spent. Annette was giv65ing
some music lessons; they guessed her condition and
they sent her away. I did some sewing.

PRES. And earned some money?

LUCIE. I couldn’t always get work. When I got it, I
was paid sevenpence-halfpenny for twelve hours. I was
not a skilled worker. Some people get a shilling and a
halfpenny. We were in despair, thinking of the child
that was coming.

PRES. That was not a reason for leading your sister
and her child to their deaths! [Lucie is seized with a
nervous trembling and does not answer]. Answer!

COUN. DEF. Give her a moment to recover, M. le président.

LUCIE [controlling herself] I wanted to get her into a
hospital, but they only take them at the end. It seems
there are homes one can go to in Paris, but not in the
provinces.

PRES. You could have applied for charity.

LUCIE. Six months residence was necessary. And
then, what should we have done with the child?

PRES. As it was impossible for you to bring it up,
your sister could have taken it to a foundling hospital.

LUCIE. Abandon it—yes, we thought of that. We
made inquiries.

COUN. DEF. It is necessary to get a certificate of indigence,
and then make an application to the board of
admission. They inquire into the case and admit or reject.
The child may die meanwhile.

LUCIE. And they make a condition that the mother
shall not know where her child is. That she shall never
see it or hear of it again. Only once a month she will
be told if it is alive or dead. Nothing more.

PRES. Proceed, madame.

LUCIE. Then I brought my children back to my husband,
because we had nothing left. I went to see the
parents of the young man, who is the cause of everything.
They practically turned me out of doors. The66
young man is going to be married.

COUN. DEF. May I say a word, M. le président?

PRES. You are sure it is only a word?

COUN. DEF. Yes, M. le président. All the guilty are not
in court. I look in vain for the seducer of this poor girl.
He is waiting anxiously in the provinces to hear the
result of this trial, fearing his name may come out. I
have received from him and from his family an imploring
letter, entreating me to spare him and not to mention
him by name during the proceedings. Until now,
as a matter of fact his name has not been mentioned,
and we are at the end of the trial. Well, I am going to
make it known at once. I shall have no more pity for
the family and the intended wife of this criminal, than
he had for the woman who is dead, and for the woman
whose life he has ruined. If there is no law in the Code
of this country which can reach him, there will be at
least indignation enough in the hearts of all honest
people to prevent Jacques Bernin from enjoying in peace
the happiness he has stolen! [Prolonged applause].

PRES [to Lucie] Proceed, madame. [Pause]. Kindly
conclude your evidence.

LUCIE. I implored my husband to take us back, Annette
and me. He wouldn’t. We came to Paris with a
little money he gave me. It was too soon for them to
take Annette into one hospital: in another, where they
would have taken her, there was no room. My husband
filed a petition for divorce.

PRES. Kindly tell us about what concerns the woman
Thomas.

LUCIE [with growing emotion] Yes, monsieur. Annette
was always reproaching herself with having accepted
what she called my sacrifice. She kept saying
she was the cause of all my troubles. [A silence]. One
day they came to fetch me and I found her dead at this
woman’s house. [In a burst of sobs, which become hysterical,
she cries out] My little sister, my poor little sister!

67

PRES [kindly, to the usher] Take her back to her
place, or, if necessary, take her outside and do all you
can for her. [To the defendants] Then none of you has
any more to say in your defence!

TUPIN [excited] Oh, if we said all we’ve got to say we
should be here until to-morrow morning!

MME. TUPIN [the same] That we should!

TUPIN [shouting] We should never stop!

PRES. I call upon the counsel for the prosecution for
his speech.

SCH. But, monsieur, you are not going to condemn
me? It’s not possible. I haven’t said everything.

TUPIN. We’re not the guilty ones.

SCH. I’m afraid of getting a bad name. And we hadn’t
the means to bring up another.

MME. TUPIN [violently, much excited] Shut up! As
it’s like that—as that’s what they do to our children—as
men have found nothing to change that—we must
do it—the women must do it. We must start the great
strike—the strike—the strike of the mothers.

Cries in the audience, ‘Yes, yes.’

PRES. Silence.

MME. TUPIN [shouting] Why should we kill ourselves
to get wage-slaves and harlots for other people?

TUPIN. We’re not the guilty ones.

PRES. I did not—

MME. THOMAS. And all the men that seduced the girls
I saved—have you punished them?

PRES. Sit down.

TUPIN. The guilty ones are the people that tell us to
have more children when the ones we have are starving.

COUN. DEF. The seducers are the guilty ones; and
social hypocrisy.

During the proceedings, anger, which rapidly becomes
fury, has taken possession of the defendants. They are
all on their feet except the schoolmistress, who goes on
sobbing and murmuring to herself unintelligibly. The68
president, also standing, strikes his desk with a paper-knife,
trying to impose silence. He shouts, but cannot
make himself heard. The tumult increases until the curtain
falls. The voices of the counsel for the defence and
the defendants drown those of the president and the counsel
for the prosecution.

MME. THOMAS. The fine gentlemen that get hold of
them and humbug them!

PRES. I will have you taken back to prison.

MME. THOMAS. And the rich young man, and the old
satyrs—and the men! The men! All the men!

COUNSEL FOR THE PROSECUTION. Police, can’t you silence
these lunatics?

COUN. DEF. You have no right to insult the defendants.

TUPIN. They’ve been doing nothing else the whole
time.

COUN. PROS. Keep this rabble quiet! The defendants
must respect the law.

COUN. DEF. And you, sir, must respect justice.

COUN. PROS. You sympathize with their crime. I am
outraged by it.

COUN. DEF. They are right. They are not guilty. You
must respect—

COUN. PROS. I demand—

COUN. DEF. Our customs are guilty, which denounce
the unmarried mother!

AUDIENCE. Bravo! Hear, hear!

COUN. PROS. I demand that the counsel for the
defence—

COUN. DEF. Every woman with child should be respected,
no matter what the circumstances are. [Applause].

PRES. Maître Verdier, by article forty-three of the
regulations—

COUN. DEF. Their crime is not an individual crime, it
is a social crime.

69

COUN. PROS. It is a crime against nature.

COUN. DEF. It is not a crime against nature. It is a revolt
against nature.

PRES. Police, remove the defendants. [The police do
not understand or do not hear]. Maître Verdier, must
we employ force? [Tumult in the whole court].

COUN. DEF [rhetorically] It is a revolt against nature!
And with all the warmth of a heart melted by pity, with
all the indignation of my outraged reason, I look for that
glorious hour of liberation when some master mind shall
discover for us the means of having only the children we
need and desire, release us for ever from the prison of
hypocrisy and absolve us from the profanation of love.
That would indeed be a conquest of nature—savage nature—which
pours out life with culpable profusion, and
sees it disappear with indifference. But, until then—

The tumult recommences.

PRES. Police, clear the court! Police—police, remove
the defendants. The sitting is suspended. [The magistrates
cover their heads and rise].

MME. THOMAS. It’s not I who massacre the innocents!
I’m not the guilty one!

SCH. Mercy, monsieur, mercy!

MME. TUPIN. She’s not the guilty one!

TUPIN. She’s right. She’s not!

MME. THOMAS. It’s the men! the men! all the men!

The magistrates go out by the narrow door reserved for
them, the backs of their red robes disappearing slowly during
the last words.

ACT I

A very undistinguished room in a house in a French
country town. The time is February. There is in the centre
of the room a table, with chairs round it; a fireplace on
the left, and window on the right; a piano; lamps; a bronze
statuette of Gutenberg; holland covers on the furniture.
There are doors to right and left and at the back.

Madame Dupont is discovered alone, darning stockings.
After a moment or two Courthezon comes in, with some papers
in his hand.

COURTHEZON. Why, you’re all alone, Madame Dupont?

MME. DUPONT. Yes, M. Courthezon.

COURTHEZON. Your young ladies are listening to the
band?

MME. DUPONT. No: Julie has gone to pay a call, and
Caroline is at Benediction. She goes every Sunday.

COURTHEZON. Oh, yes, of course.

MME. DUPONT. On Sunday we never see her, except at
déjeûner. The rest of the day she’s at church. I believe
she never misses a service. And now she is one of the Enfants
de Marie. At her age, too!

COURTHEZON. How old is she?

MME. DUPONT. Thirty-three.

COURTHEZON. And still very religious?

MME. DUPONT. Very.

COURTHEZON [nodding] Her mother was just the same.

MME. DUPONT. You remember my husband’s first wife?

76

COURTHEZON. Yes. I came to the printing office two
years before she died. [Pause] M. Dupont is at his game
at the Café du Commerce, no doubt? I should be there
myself if I could afford it.

MME. DUPONT. You have your savings.

COURTHEZON. Precisely; and I don’t want to lose them.
But you are working, Madame Dupont?

MME. DUPONT. Mending some stockings. One must find
something to do.

COURTHEZON. I’ve been hard at it, too, all day.

MME. DUPONT. Still at your invention?

COURTHEZON. Yes. I tell you it’s splendid. I’ve been
downstairs to the printing office to see if there were any
orders.

MME. DUPONT. Were there any?

COURTHEZON [looking through papers in his hand] Three
hundred visiting cards, a price list, and an announcement.

MME. DUPONT [stopping her work] Death? Birth?

COURTHEZON. Neither. A marriage.

MME. DUPONT. Give it me. [Reads paper which Courthezon
gives her] M. Jacquemin. M. Jacquemin! And
who is this Mlle. Martha Violet whom he is marrying?

COURTHEZON. One of the Violets of the Rue du Pré.

MME. DUPONT. Oh, yes: of course. [To Courthezon, who
makes as if to take back the paper] Leave it with me. I
will send it down to you. I want to show it to Julie. So
you are pleased with your invention?

COURTHEZON [sitting down] I am delighted with it. Delighted!
I’ve been working at it twenty years! And now
it’s finished. What do you think of that?

Enter Caroline. She is tall, stringy, not pretty, not attractive,
but not absurd. She has a prayer-book in her hand.

MME. DUPONT [carelessly, to Courthezon, who has stopped]
Go on. It’s only Caroline. [Interested] And you still won’t
tell us what it is?

COURTHEZON. Not yet. [Rising, bowing to Caroline]
Good day, Mlle. Caroline.

77

CAROLINE [half-returning his bow] Good day, M. Courthezon.

MME. DUPONT. I can imagine how pleased you are.

COURTHEZON. Of course I am.

CAROLINE. You have finished your invention!

COURTHEZON. Yes. How did you guess?

CAROLINE [a little confused] Oh, only—

COURTHEZON. Only?

CAROLINE [in a lower voice] Only that I knew it.

COURTHEZON. You knew it?

CAROLINE [confused] Yes. But never mind about that.

MME. DUPONT [to Courthezon] And now you will become
a rich man, eh, M. Courthezon?

COURTHEZON. Not all at once. I must first find someone
who will buy my invention, or who will advance me money
to push it for myself. But there’s plenty of time to think
of all that: and whether I succeed or not, I am glad to
have given twenty years of my life to inventing something
that will make life a little easier for those who will come
after me. And now I am going downstairs to the office to
do a little work. You’ll send down that announcement,
won’t you?

MME. DUPONT. I won’t forget.

COURTHEZON. Good evening, Madame Dupont. Good
evening, Mlle. Caroline.

CAROLINE       MME. DUPONT. Good evening, M. Courthezon.

Courthezon goes out.

MME. DUPONT. Why were you so sure he had completed
his invention?

CAROLINE [confused, after a moment’s silence] You won’t
tell anyone, mother?

MME. DUPONT. No.

CAROLINE. Because I prayed for it.

MME. DUPONT [not spitefully, but with a slight shrug of
the shoulders] I see.

Julie comes in.

78

JULIE. Here I am, maman [she kisses her]. You here,
Caro? [She does not kiss her].

MME. DUPONT. Ah, Julie! Sit down, dear, and tell me
what you have been doing and whom you have seen.

[Her warm greeting to Julie contrasts markedly with the
cold reception she previously gave to Caroline].

JULIE. I went to see Madame Leseigneur.

MME. DUPONT. I might have guessed that.

JULIE. Why?

MME. DUPONT. You only go to houses where there are
children. And as Madame Leseigneur has six—

JULIE. I wish I were in her place. Only think: André,
the youngest, you know, the one who is only six months
old?

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

JULIE. He recognised me. There never was such a baby
for taking notice.

MME. DUPONT. You talk as if you were a mother yourself.

JULIE. Jean laughed till he cried when he saw what I
had brought him. Charles and Pierre were in disgrace
because they’d been fighting. But I got their mother to
forgive them, so that was all right. To-morrow I shall
go to Madame Durand to hear how Jacques is going on.
I hear he has the whooping-cough.

MME. DUPONT [laughing] You ought to have been a
nurse.

JULIE [seriously] No, no. I should have died when I had
to leave the first child I had nursed.

MME. DUPONT. Then you should marry.

JULIE. Yes. [Pause].

MME. DUPONT [to Caroline] Well, Caroline, what are
you doing there with your mouth open?

CAROLINE. I was listening.

MME. DUPONT. Have you finished your painting?

CAROLINE. No. I still have six of the Marie Antoinette
figures to do, and a dozen china Cupids to finish.

79

JULIE. How funny it is to think of Caro painting Cupids!

CAROLINE. Why?

MME. DUPONT [to Caroline] And you have to send all
those off by twelve o’clock to-morrow?

CAROLINE. Yes.

MME. DUPONT. You will never have them ready.

CAROLINE. I shall manage.

MME. DUPONT. You might do a little at them now, before
dinner, instead of sitting there twiddling your fingers.

CAROLINE. I shall get up early to-morrow.

MME. DUPONT. Even if you do get up early—

CAROLINE. I shall begin at six, as soon as it is light.

MME. DUPONT. Still, you might do some work on them
now.

CAROLINE. I would rather not.

MME. DUPONT. Because it’s Sunday, I suppose; and one
mustn’t work on Sunday.

CAROLINE. Yes. [Pause] Why should you mind, mother,
if I—

MME. DUPONT. I? Not the least in the world. Do as you
please. You are old enough to decide for yourself.

JULIE [who has been reading one of the papers] Is Courthezon
down in the office? I should like the next part of
this.

MME. DUPONT. You know quite well your father doesn’t
like you to read the proofs of the stories he has to print.

JULIE. I have no others. Listen to this: isn’t it too
bad to have to stop there? [Reads] ‘Solange was still
in Robert’s arms. At this moment the Count entered,
menacing, terrible, his revolver in his hand.’ I do so
want to know what happened next!

CAROLINE. The Count will kill them, of course. It is
his right.

JULIE. I wonder.

CAROLINE. According to law.

JULIE. That’s no reason. I want to read over again80
where Robert comes in. It’s lovely. And the meeting
with Solange in Italy, one evening in May. Where is it?
Ah, here! [Reads] ‘Under the deep blue of the sky,
picked out by stars, by the shore of the calm sea that a
perfumed breeze just ruffled, and in which were reflected
with the stars above the many distant lights of Mentone
and of Monte Carlo—’

MME. DUPONT [smiling] And your father imagines he
has cured you of all such foolishness!

JULIE. I am doing no harm.

MME. DUPONT. No matter. I would rather you didn’t
read any more novels.

JULIE. Why? Berthe Paillant reads all the stories that
come out, and she’s younger than I am.

MME. DUPONT. Berthe Paillant is married.

JULIE. There it is! If one is not to remain a child to
the end of one’s days one must marry. I am twenty-four,
and I may’nt read the books which Berthe can read
at eighteen.

MME. DUPONT. There’s my thread broken again. I believe
you bought it at Lagnier’s, Caroline.

CAROLINE. Yes.

MME. DUPONT. Why didn’t you go to Laurent’s?

CAROLINE. I thought we ought to deal with those who
believe as we do.

MME. DUPONT. If only one could find a good Catholic
who sold good wool!

CAROLINE. There isn’t one in the town.

JULIE [with a sigh] Heigho! You don’t know of a husband
for me, do you, Caro?

CAROLINE. What sort of one do you want?

JULIE [seriously] I am getting to the time of life when
a woman accepts the first man who offers himself.
Choose whatever sort you think best for me [laughing].
What would be your ideal? Someone in business? A
captain in the army? Tell me.

CAROLINE. No.

81

JULIE. Why not?

CAROLINE. If I were to marry, I should choose a worker,
a man with a noble aim, a man who would be ready to
sacrifice himself to make life a little easier for those who
will come after him.

MME. DUPONT. Oh, don’t talk like a sentimental novel,
Caroline.

CAROLINE. I was not.

MME. DUPONT. Well, I’m sure I’ve read that somewhere.
Besides, at your age one doesn’t speak of those
things any longer.

JULIE. Talking of that, you know Henriette Longuet?

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

JULIE. She is going to be married.

MME. DUPONT. Indeed?

JULIE. Yes. [Thoughtfully] I’m the last to go.

MME. DUPONT. The last go off best. What a week this
is for marriages! Courthezon brought me an announcement
just now which I kept to show you. Where is it?
Ah, here it is. [Hands it to her].

JULIE [after looking at it, sadly] That finishes it!

MME. DUPONT. What do you mean?

CAROLINE. What is it, Julie?

JULIE. Nothing.

MME. DUPONT. Were you thinking of M. Jacquemin?

JULIE. How do I know? He has never said anything to
me, of course, but I fancied he had noticed me. I didn’t
care much about him, but he was better than nothing.
Better than nothing! [Sighs] It’s a stupid sort of world
for girls nowadays.

Dupont comes in.

DUPONT [brimming over with excitement and importance]
Ah! Here are the children. Run away, my dears,
for a few minutes. I’ll call you when I want you.

JULIE [going with Caroline] Caroline! Do you think
it is—?

CAROLINE [thoughtfully] It does look like it.

82

They go out together.

MME. DUPONT. Well, what is it?

DUPONT [with an air of importance] M. and Madame
Mairaut will be here in an hour, at six o’clock.

MME. DUPONT. Yes?

DUPONT [craftily] And do you know why they are
coming?

MME. DUPONT. No.

DUPONT. To ask for Julie’s hand in marriage. That’s
all!

MME. DUPONT. For their son?

DUPONT. Well, my dear, it’s not for the Sultan of
Turkey.

MME. DUPONT. M. Mairaut, the banker.

DUPONT. M. Mairaut, head of the Banque de l’Univers,
14 Rue des Trois-Chapeaux, second floor.

MME. DUPONT. Yes; but—

DUPONT. Now, now, don’t excite yourself. Don’t lose
your head. The thing isn’t done yet. Listen. For the
last fortnight, at the Merchants’ Club, Mairaut has been
taking me aside and talking about Julie—asking me
this, that, and the other. As you may suppose, I let
him run on. To-day we were talking together about
the difficulty of marrying one’s children. ‘I know something
of that,’ said he. ‘So do I,’ I said. Then he grinned
at me and said: ‘Supposing Madame Mairaut and I were
to come in one of these days to discuss the question with
you and Madame Dupont?’ You may imagine my delight.
I simply let myself go. But no, when I say I let
myself go, I do myself an injustice. I kept a hand over
myself all the time. ‘One of these days. Next week, perhaps?’
I said, carelessly, just like that. ‘Why not to-day?’
said he. ‘As you please,’ said I. ‘Six o’clock?’
’Six o’clock.’ What do you think of that?

MME. DUPONT. But M. Mairaut—the son, I mean—Monsieur—what
is his Christian name?

DUPONT. Antonin, Antonin Mairaut.

83

MME. DUPONT. Antonin, of course. I was wondering.
Is M. Antonin Mairaut quite the husband we should
choose for Julie?

DUPONT. I know what you mean. His life isn’t all that
it should be. There’s that woman—

MME. DUPONT. So people say.

DUPONT. But we needn’t bother about that. There’s
another matter, however, that is worth considering—though,
of course, you haven’t thought of it. Women
never do think of the really important things.

MME. DUPONT. You mean money? The Mairauts haven’t
any. They only keep a couple of clerks altogether in their
bank. They may have to put up the shutters any day.

DUPONT. Yes: but there’s someone else who may put
his shutters up first. Antonin’s uncle. The old buffer may
die. And he has two hundred thousand francs, and never
spends a penny.

MME. DUPONT. True. But—

DUPONT. But. But. There you go. You’re determined
never to see anything that is more than an inch before
your nose. I don’t blame you for it. Women are like
that.

MME. DUPONT. But suppose he disinherits Antonin?

DUPONT. You forget I shall be there. I flatter myself
I shall know how to prevent Uncle Maréchal from disinheriting
his nephew. Besides, what is Uncle Maréchal?

MME. DUPONT. Antonin’s uncle.

DUPONT. You don’t understand. I ask you what he is.
What is his position, I mean.

MME. DUPONT. He’s head clerk at the Prefecture.

DUPONT. Exactly. And he could get me the contract
for all the printing work at his office. Thirty thousand
francs a year! How much profit does that mean?

MME. DUPONT. Five thousand francs.

DUPONT. Five thousand? Ten thousand! If one is only
to make the ordinary trade profit, what’s the good of Government
contracts?

84

MME. DUPONT. I’m afraid young M. Mairaut’s character—

DUPONT. His character! We know nothing about his
character. He has one virtue which nothing can take
away from him: he is his uncle’s nephew. And his
uncle can get me work that will bring in ten thousand
francs a year, besides being as rich as Crœsus.

MME. DUPONT. Still, are you sure that he is the right
sort of husband for Julie?

DUPONT. He is the right sort of husband for Julie, and
the right sort of son-in-law for me.

MME. DUPONT [dubiously] Well, you know more of
these things than I do.

DUPONT [looks at his watch] Ten minutes past five.
Now listen to me. We have very little time, but I feel
the ideas surging through my brain with extraordinary
clearness. It’s only in moments of emergency that I feel
myself master of all my faculties, though I flatter myself
I’m not altogether a fool at the worst of times. [He sits
upon a chair, his hands leaning upon the back of it]. I will
explain everything to you, so that you may make as few
blunders as possible. We must get old Mairaut to agree
that all the money, Julie’s and Antonin’s, shall be the joint
property of them both.

MME. DUPONT. But there will be Julie’s dot.

DUPONT [pettishly] If you keep interrupting we shall
never be done. The joint property of them both, on account
of Uncle Maréchal’s money. Do you understand?

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

DUPONT. That’s a blessing. Well, then we shall ask
for—

MME. DUPONT. No settlements. I understand.

DUPONT. On the contrary, we shall ask for the strictest
settlements on both sides.

MME. DUPONT. But—

DUPONT. You are out of your depth. Better simply
listen without trying to understand. [He rises, replaces85
his chair, and taps her knowingly on the shoulder]. In
these cases one should never ask for the thing one wants.
One must know how to get the other side to offer it, and
be quite pleased to get it accepted. Well, then, I am giving
Julie fifty thousand francs as her dot.

MME. DUPONT. Fifty thousand! But Julie has only
twenty-five thousand.

DUPONT. That is so. I shall give her twenty-five thousand
down and promise the rest for next year.

MME. DUPONT. You can’t mean that. You will never be
able to keep such a promise. [She rises].

DUPONT. Who knows? If I get the contract from the
Prefecture.

MME. DUPONT. We ought to ask Julie what she thinks
of this marriage.

DUPONT. We haven’t much time, then. Still, call her:
and take off these covers [pointing to the chairs].

MME. DUPONT [she goes towards the door on the right;
then returns] But have you thought—

DUPONT. I have thought of everything.

MME. DUPONT. Of everything? What about Angèle and
her story?

DUPONT [pompously] Angèle is no longer my daughter.

MME. DUPONT. Still, we shall have to tell them.

DUPONT. Naturally. Since they know it already.

MME. DUPONT. I am nearly sure it was she I met last
time I was in Paris.

DUPONT. You were mistaken.

MME. DUPONT. I don’t think so.

DUPONT. In any case, in acting as I did I was doing my
duty. I can hold my head up and fear nothing. Call Julie.
She will help you to put the room tidy. [Madame Dupont
goes out].

DUPONT [rubbing his hands] I think I’ve managed
things pretty well this time! I think so!

Julie and Madame Dupont come in.

JULIE. Father, is it someone who wants to marry me?

86

DUPONT. It is. [To Madame Dupont, pointing to the
chairs] Take off those covers. [To Julie] You know
young M. Mairaut—M. Antonin Mairaut? [He sits down].
You have danced together several times.

JULIE. Yes.

DUPONT. What do you think of him?

JULIE. As a husband?

DUPONT. As a husband. Don’t answer in a hurry. Take
off that cover from the chair you are sitting on and give
it to your mother.

JULIE [obeying] Have his parents formally proposed for
him?

MME. DUPONT. No. But if they should do so your father
and I wish to know—

DUPONT [to Madame Dupont, giving her the last chair
cover, which he has taken off himself] Take all these
away. [Madame Dupont goes out]. The formal offer has
not been made, but it will be soon, in less than an hour.

JULIE. Is that why you are taking all this trouble?
[She points to the chairs].

DUPONT. Precisely. We mustn’t appear to be paupers
or people without social position. [He seizes a bowl in
which there are some visiting cards]. Very old, these
cards. Very yellow. And the names, too, common rather.
I must put that right. [To his wife, who returns] Go down
to the printing office and ask Courthezon to give you
some printed specimens of our new visiting cards at three
francs—no, three francs fifty. And then put that Wagner
opera on the piano which someone left to be bound.
[Madame Dupont goes. To Julie] I have no desire to influence
you, my dear.

JULIE. Still—

DUPONT [going to the mantelpiece] Still what? Wait
while I light the lamp [He strikes a match].

JULIE. Why, it’s still quite light.

DUPONT. When one receives visitors one doesn’t wait
till it is dark before—You are old enough to know—what87
the deuce is the matter with the oil?—old enough to
know what you are about. Damn the lamps! When they
are never lighted it is the devil’s own job to make them
burn. Yes, as I was saying, it is for you to weigh the pros
and the cons. Marriage—— There! [He looks round him]
Is there anything else to be done to make things look
better? What is that over there? That great stupid
Caroline’s hat!

MME. DUPONT [coming in and bringing visiting cards
and a piano score of an opera] Here are the cards and the
music book.

DUPONT. Thanks. [He gives Caroline’s hat to Madame
Dupont] Take this thing away. And these stockings.
Hide them somewhere. You don’t want to appear to do
your own darning, confound it! It’s extraordinary you
shouldn’t have thought of that. [Madame Dupont goes out,
returning in a moment. Dupont continues mechanically
to Julie] It is for you to weigh the pros and cons. This
is better. Vicomte de Liverolles; M. L’Abbé Candar,
Honorary Canon; Ange Nitron, Ex-Municipal Councillor.
That will look well enough. The Wagner score on
the piano, open, of course. That’s right. There’s something
else I want, though. Julie, the box of cigars which
M. Gueroult sent me when he was elected to the Chamber.

JULIE [bringing a box] Here it is.

DUPONT. Give it me.

JULIE. You haven’t begun it yet.

DUPONT. Wait. [He rummages in his pocket and takes
out a knife, which he opens] We must show them that
other people besides deputies smoke cigars at five sous.
[He opens the box] Without being proud, one has one’s
dignity to keep up. There! [He takes a handful of cigars
and gives them to his daughter] Put those in the drawer
so that the box mayn’t seem to have been opened on purpose
for them. [He arranges the box on the table]. A
fashion paper? Excellent! And for myself [to Mme. Dupont]88
Léontine, give me a fresh ribbon of my Order of
Christ. This one is faded. [To his daughter] He is twenty-eight.
He is good looking and distinguished. He passed
his law examination at Bordeaux. [He puts a fresh ribbon
in his coat and looks at himself for a considerable time
in the glass]. In a town where I was not known this would
be as good as the Legion of Honour. [He turns round].
Well? Have you made up your mind?

JULIE. I should like more time to think it over.

DUPONT. You have still a quarter of an hour.

MME. DUPONT. She would like a few days, perhaps.

DUPONT. That’s it. Shilly shally! We are to have the
story of that great stupid Caroline over again, are we?
No! Your sister, whom you see now an old maid, who
will never be married, unless her aunt in Calcutta leaves
her some money—your sister, too, had her chance one
day. She hum’d and ha’d; she wanted to think it over.
And you see the result. That’s what thinking it over
leads to. Here she is, still on my hands!

MME. DUPONT. You mustn’t say that. She earns her own
living.

DUPONT. She earns her own living, perhaps; but she
remains on my hands all the same. By the way, we had
better not say anything to the Mairauts about Caroline’s
working for money.

MME. DUPONT. They are sure to know.

DUPONT. Not they. What was I saying? Oh, yes. She
remains on my hands all the same. And one old maid is
quite enough in the family. Two would be intolerable.
Remember, my child, you have no dot—at least, none
worth mentioning. And as things go nowadays, when
one has no dot, one mustn’t be too particular.

JULIE. To marry nowadays, then, a girl has to buy her
husband?

DUPONT [shrugs] Well—

JULIE. And there’s nothing but misery for girls who
have no money.

89

DUPONT. It’s not quite as bad as that. But obviously
there is a better choice for those who have a good fortune.

JULIE [bitterly] And the others must be content with
damaged goods, much reduced in price!

DUPONT. There are exceptions, of course. But, as a
rule, husbands are like anything else. If you want a good
article, you must be prepared to pay for it.

MME. DUPONT. And, even so, one is often cheated.

DUPONT. Possibly. But M. Antonin Mairaut is a very
eligible young man. No? What do you want, then, in
Heaven’s name? If you are waiting for a royal prince,
say so. Are you waiting for a prince? Answer me. Come,
my child, this is an opportunity you may never see again:
a young man, well brought up, with an uncle who is head
clerk at the Prefecture and can double my profits by putting
the contract for printing in my way, not to speak of
other things. And you raise difficulties!

MME. DUPONT. Think, dear. You are four-and-twenty.

DUPONT. And you have had the astonishing good luck
to captivate this young fellow—at a ball, it seems.

JULIE. I believe so. He wanted to kiss me in one of the
passages. I had to put him in his place.

MME. DUPONT. You were quite right.

DUPONT. I don’t say she wasn’t—that is, if she didn’t
overdo it. In his case I’m sure it was only playfulness.

MME. DUPONT. Oh, of course.

JULIE. I only half like him, father.

DUPONT. Well, if you half like him, that’s always something.
Plenty of people marry without even that.

MME. DUPONT. You don’t dislike him, do you, Julie?

JULIE. No.

DUPONT [triumphantly] Well, then!

JULIE. That’s hardly enough, is it?

DUPONT. Come, come, my dear, we must talk seriously.
As a child you were full of romantic notions. Thank
Heaven, I cured you of that weakness. You know well90
enough that unhappy marriages are, more often than not,
love marriages.

JULIE [unconvinced] I know, I know. Still, I want to
have a husband who loves me.

DUPONT. But he does love you, doesn’t he, since you’ve
only just told us that he wanted to kiss you at a ball.

JULIE. I want to be something more than my husband’s
plaything.

DUPONT. You’ll lead your husband by the nose, never
fear.

JULIE. How do you know?

DUPONT. Never you mind. I know it. And now really
we have had enough of this. You think that a whim of
yours is to upset all my plans, prevent me from increasing
my printing business and retiring next year, as we
intended, your mother and I. You think we haven’t—I
haven’t—worked enough, I suppose. You don’t wish us
to have a little rest before we die? You think I have not
earned that rest, perhaps? Answer me! You think I
have not earned it?

JULIE. Of course you have, father.

DUPONT [mollified] Very well, then. Still, I don’t want
to make you uncomfortable. I don’t press you for a definite
answer to-day. All I ask is that you won’t be obstinate,
or refuse to let us present Antonin to you as a
possible husband, if his parents make any advances.
That is all. You will, then, talk with him, ask him questions.
Naturally, you must get to know each other.

MME. DUPONT. Think carefully, my child.

DUPONT. Make up your mind whether you wish to follow
the example of that great stupid Caroline.

MME. DUPONT. You are quite old enough to be married.
[A pause].

DUPONT. Answer. Aren’t you old enough to be married?

JULIE. Quite, father.

DUPONT. Have you any other offers?

91

MME. DUPONT. Have you any choice?

JULIE. No.

DUPONT. You see!

MME. DUPONT. You see!

DUPONT. Well, then, it’s all settled. [He looks at his
watch] And only just in time! M. Mairaut is punctuality
itself. It’s five minutes to six. In five minutes he will be
here. [Julie is silent, gazing through the open window.
The laughter of children is heard outside. To Madame
Dupont, irritably] What’s she looking out of that window
for?

MME. DUPONT. It’s Madame Brichot. She is just going
in with her children.

JULIE [to herself, with a smile of great sweetness, recalling
a word which she has just caught while dreaming]
Maman!

DUPONT. Well?

JULIE. I will do as you wish.

DUPONT. Ouf! Now go and change your dress.

JULIE. Change my dress?

MME. DUPONT. Of course. You will be supposed to know
nothing; but you must be tidy.

JULIE. What am I to put on?

MME. DUPONT [reflecting] Let me see. [A sudden inspiration]
I know. Isn’t there a dance at the Gontiers’
to-night?

JULIE. But we said we wouldn’t go.

MME. DUPONT [rising, briskly] We are going all the
same. Put on your ball dress.

JULIE. Before dinner? Is he marrying my clothes?

MME DUPONT. No. But you look best in your ball dress.
Do as I tell you, dear.

JULIE. Very well. [She goes out].

DUPONT. Are you really going to this ball?

MME. DUPONT. Certainly not.

DUPONT. Well, then?

MME. DUPONT. M. Antonin is coming.

92

DUPONT [understanding] And Julie looks far better
when she is—you are quite right. [A bell rings]. There
they are! Come into the next room, quick!

MME. DUPONT. Why?

DUPONT. We must keep them waiting a little. It creates
an impression. [To the maid, who passes to go to open the
door, in an undertone] Ask them to wait a moment.

MAID. Yes, monsieur.

DUPONT. Now, then. [He bustles Madame Dupont out
of the room. After a moment M. and Madame Mairaut
enter, followed by the maid. Their faces wear a genial
smile, which freezes as soon as they see that the room is
empty].

MAIRAUT. They are not here?

MAID. I will tell madame. [She goes out].

MME. MAIRAUT. Tell madame! [To her husband] They
saw us coming.

MAIRAUT. You think so?

MME. MAIRAUT. Of course. Why was that lamp lighted?
Not for an empty room, I imagine! I don’t think much
of their furniture. Very poor. Very poor. [Lifts up a piece
of stuff from the back of an armchair] This chair has been
re-covered.

MAIRAUT [at the bowl with the visiting cards] They
know some good people.

MME. MAIRAUT. Let me see. [She looks at the bowl].
Those cards were put there expressly for us not an hour
ago.

MAIRAUT. Oh, come!

MME. MAIRAUT. Look! The top ones are all new. The
underneath ones are quite yellow.

MAIRAUT. Because the underneath ones are older.

MME. MAIRAUT. Because the underneath ones have been
left out ever since New Year’s Day, while these are just
printed. We must be careful. Above all things, don’t you
make a fool of yourself.

MAIRAUT. All right.

93

MME. MAIRAUT. Don’t let them think you’re set on this
marriage.

MAIRAUT. I understand.

MME. MAIRAUT. Get them to offer that all moneys shall
be held jointly.

MAIRAUT. Yes.

MME. MAIRAUT. And to work this, insist on separate settlements.

MAIRAUT. Yes.

MME. MAIRAUT. For the rest, do as you usually do. Say
as little as possible.

MAIRAUT. But—

MME. MAIRAUT. You know well enough that’s the only
way you ever do succeed with things.

MAIRAUT. But there’s something I want to say to you.

MME. MAIRAUT. Then it’s sure to be something stupid.
However, we have nothing better to do. Go on.

MAIRAUT. It’s what I spoke to you about before. It’s
been worrying me a good deal. If the Duponts give us
their daughter, who has probably a dot of twenty-five
thousand francs—

MME. MAIRAUT. Twenty or twentyfive thousand, I expect.

MAIRAUT. Well, if they give her to us, who have nothing
but the bank, it must be because they don’t know
that Uncle Maréchal is ruined.

MME. MAIRAUT. Obviously. Nobody knows.

MAIRAUT. It isn’t honest not to tell them.

MME. MAIRAUT. Why?

MAIRAUT. Surely, my dear—

MME. MAIRAUT. If you’re going to tell them that, we
may as well be off at once.

MAIRAUT. You see!

MME. MAIRAUT. I see that we ought to hold our tongues.
Oh, yes: we ought. For if you have scruples about injuring
the Duponts, I have scruples about injuring Uncle
Maréchal.

94

MAIRAUT. What do you mean?

MME. MAIRAUT. We have no right to betray a secret.
I’m sorry you shouldn’t have seen that I am quite as particular
as you are; only I put my duty to my family before
my duty to strangers. If I am wrong, say so.

MAIRAUT. But if they ask us point blank?

MME. MAIRAUT. Then we must consult Uncle Maréchal,
since he is the principal person concerned.

MAIRAUT. In spite of all you say it seems to me—[He
hesitates. A pause].

MME. MAIRAUT. Well, my dear, which is it to be? If you
want us to go, let us go. You are the master. I have never
forgotten it. Shall we go?

MAIRAUT [giving in, after a moment of painful indecision]
Now that we are here, what would the Duponts
think of us?

MME. MAIRAUT. And then we must remember that the
eldest Dupont girl got into trouble and is now living a disreputable
life in Paris. That will make them less difficult.

MAIRAUT. Hush!

Madame Dupont and Dupont enter the room. General
greetings. ‘How do you do, dear madame? How are you?
How good of you to call! Sit down,’ etc. All sit. Silence.

MME. MAIRAUT. My dear Madame Dupont, I will come
straight to the point. The object of our visit is this. M.
Mairaut and I think we have observed that mademoiselle,
your daughter, has made an impression—how shall
I put it? A certain impression on our son.

MAIRAUT. A certain impression. Yes.

MME. MAIRAUT. Antonin will join us here immediately,
but of course we have said nothing to him about this.

DUPONT. Julie, of course, has not the least idea—

MME. DUPONT. She is dressing. We are going to the
ball at the Gontiers’ to-night, and the dear child asked if
she might dress before dinner.

DUPONT. Not that she is vain.

MME. DUPONT. Not the least in the world.

95

DUPONT [to his wife, in an off-hand tone] She makes
her own dresses, doesn’t she?

MME. DUPONT. Of course. In this house we don’t know
what it is to have a bill from the dressmaker.

DUPONT. Yet with all her other occupations she’s an
excellent musician.

MME. DUPONT. Quite excellent. She has a passion for
really good music. She knows Wagner thoroughly.

MME. MAIRAUT. Wagner! Good heavens!

MME. DUPONT. To talk about, I mean.

MME. MAIRAUT. I know your daughter is charming.

MME. DUPONT. And good, too. You would never believe
how responsive that poor child is to affection!

DUPONT [to Mairaut, offering the box] Have a cigar?

MAIRAUT. No, thanks. I never smoke before dinner.

DUPONT. Take one, all the same. You can smoke it
afterwards. They are my usual brand, but pretty fair.

MAIRAUT [taking one] Thank you.

MME. MAIRAUT. If Antonin is not married already it is
because his father and I wished him to find a wife who
is worthy of him. The question of money, with us, is of
secondary importance.

MME. DUPONT. And with us. I’m so glad we agree
about that.

MME. MAIRAUT. Antonin might have made quite a
number of good matches.

DUPONT. It is just the same with Julie. In spite of that
unfortunate affair in the family.

MAIRAUT. Yes, we know.

MME. MAIRAUT. Unfortunate affair? We have heard
nothing of any unfortunate affair. What are you saying,
my dear?

MAIRAUT [mumbling confusedly] I was saying—nothing—I
was saying—No, I wasn’t saying anything.

MME. MAIRAUT [to Madame Dupont] Then there has
been some unfortunate affair in your family?

DUPONT. Yes. By my first marriage I had two daught96ers.
One, that great fool of a Caroline whom you know.

MME. MAIRAUT. Quite well. She remains unmarried,
does she not?

DUPONT. She prefers it. That’s the only reason. The
other was called Angèle. When she was seventeen she
was guilty of an indiscretion which it became impossible
to hide. I turned her out of my house. [Quite sincerely]
I was deeply distressed at having to do it.

MME. DUPONT. For three days he refused to eat anything.

DUPONT. Yes, I was terribly distressed. But I knew
my duty as a man of honor, and I did it.

MME. MAIRAUT. It was noble of you! [She shakes him
warmly by the hand].

MAIRAUT. Since you were so fond of her, perhaps it
would have been better to keep her with you.

MME. MAIRAUT. My dear, you are speaking without
thinking. [To Dupont] And what has become of her?

DUPONT [lying fluently] She’s in India.

MME. DUPONT. In India?

DUPONT [to Madame Dupont] Yes, with her aunt, a sister
of my first wife’s. I have had news of her from time to
time. [To Madame Mairaut] Indirectly, of course.

MME. MAIRAUT. I repeat, M. Dupont, all this does you
honor. [Thoughtfully] Still, some people might feel—However,
I don’t think this discovery need make us abandon
our project at once. Not at once. [To Mairaut]
What do you think, my dear?

MAIRAUT. I?

MME. MAIRAUT. You think, as I do, that we must take
time to consider, do you not? [A pause]. Without any
definite promise on either side, but merely in order to
get rid of all money questions, which are most distasteful
to me, will you allow me to ask you one question, M.
Dupont?

DUPONT. Certainly, Madame Mairaut.

MME. MAIRAUT. Have you ever considered [she hesit97ates]
what you would give your daughter?

DUPONT. Oh, yes—roughly, you know.

MAIRAUT. Just so.

MME. MAIRAUT. And the sum is—roughly?

DUPONT. Fifty thousand francs.

MME. MAIRAUT. Fifty thousand francs. [To her husband]
You hear, dear, M. Dupont will give his daughter
only fifty thousand francs.

MAIRAUT. Yes. [A pause].

MME. MAIRAUT. In cash, of course.

DUPONT. Twentyfive thousand at once. Twentyfive
thousand in six months.

MME. MAIRAUT [to Mairaut] You hear?

MAIRAUT. Yes.

MME. MAIRAUT. For practical purposes that is only
twentyfive thousand francs and a promise.

DUPONT [with dignity]. Twentyfive thousand francs
and my word.

MME. MAIRAUT. Precisely. That is what I said [looking
at her husband]. Under these circumstances, we regret
very much, but M. Mairaut must decline. It really is not
enough.

DUPONT. How much are you giving M. Antonin?

MME. MAIRAUT. Not a sou! On that point we are quite
decided and quite frank. As soon as he marries his father
will take him into partnership, and his wife’s dot will be
the capital which he will put into the business.

MAIRAUT. That is the exact position.

MME. MAIRAUT. Antonin will have nothing except what
may come to him after our death.

MME. DUPONT. And I am glad to think you are both in
excellent health.

MME. MAIRAUT [modestly] That is so.

MME. DUPONT [meditatively]. Hasn’t your son an uncle,
by the way?

MME. MAIRAUT. Yes, madame.

MAIRAUT. Uncle Maréchal.

98

DUPONT. People say M. Maréchal has a great affection
for M. Antonin.

MME. MAIRAUT. Yes.

MAIRAUT. Very great.

DUPONT. He is rich, too, people say.

MME. MAIRAUT. So they say.

MAIRAUT. However, we haven’t taken him into account,
have we?

MME. DUPONT. Still, M. Maréchal would naturally leave
everything to his nephew.

MAIRAUT       MME. MAIRAUT [together] Oh, certainly. We
can promise that. He will leave him everything he has.

MME. DUPONT. M. Maréchal has considerable influence
at the Prefecture, has he not?

MME. MAIRAUT. No doubt. But all this is really beside
the mark. At twentyfive thousand francs we could not—

DUPONT. I am sorry.

MME. MAIRAUT. We are sorry, too. [She rises, saying
to her husband] Come, my dear, we must be taking our
leave.

DUPONT. I might, perhaps, go to thirty thousand.

MME. MAIRAUT. I am afraid fifty thousand is the lowest.

DUPONT. Let us split the difference. Thirty thousand
and my country house at St. Laurent.

MME. MAIRAUT. But it is flooded two months out of the
twelve.

DUPONT. Flooded! Never.

MME. MAIRAUT [to her husband] Well, my dear, what
do you think?

MAIRAUT. Antonin is much attached to Mlle. Julie.

MME. MAIRAUT. Ah, yes, if it were not for that! [Seats
herself] My poor boy! [She weeps].

MME. DUPONT. My poor little Julie! [She weeps].

MAIRAUT [to Dupont] You must excuse her. After all,
it is her son.

DUPONT. My dear sir, I quite understand.

MME. MAIRAUT [wiping her eyes] And, of course, there99
would be the other twentyfive thousand in six months.

MME. DUPONT. Of course.

MME. MAIRAUT. Have you any views as to settlements?

DUPONT. On that point I have very definite ideas.

MAIRAUT. So have I.

DUPONT. The money on each side must be strictly settled.

MAIRAUT. Strictly settled? [A silence of astonishment].

DUPONT. Yes.

MAIRAUT. His and hers?

DUPONT. Certainly. You agree?

MAIRAUT. Oh, yes, I agree, I agree. Unless you preferred—

DUPONT. That all moneys should be held jointly?

MAIRAUT. Perhaps that would be—

DUPONT. Perhaps so. There is something distasteful,
I might almost say sordid, about strict settlements.

MAIRAUT. That’s it. Something sordid.

DUPONT. They imply a certain distrust.

MAIRAUT. Yes, don’t they? Well, that’s agreed, then?

DUPONT. Quite. The moneys to be held jointly. All
moneys, that is, that may come to them in the future.
The first twentyfive thousand, of course, will be settled
on Julie. They will form the dot.

MME. MAIRAUT. The second twentyfive thousand, which
you will pay over in six months, to be held jointly.

DUPONT. Yes. We will draw up a little agreement.

MAIRAUT. Quite so.

Antonin Mairaut comes in. He is a handsome youth of
twenty-eight, very correct in manner. Greetings are exchanged.

MME. MAIRAUT. Antonin. [To Dupont and Madame
Dupont] You allow me?

MME. DUPONT. By all means.

MME. MAIRAUT [She draws Antonin aside and says to
him in a low voice] It’s settled.

ANTONIN. How much?

100

MME. MAIRAUT. Thirty thousand, the house, and twentyfive
thousand in six months.

ANTONIN. Good.

MME. MAIRAUT. Now you’ve only the girl to deal with.

ANTONIN. Is she romantic or matter of fact? I don’t
quite know.

MME. MAIRAUT. Romantic. Raves about Wagner.

ANTONIN. Good heavens!

MME. MAIRAUT. So I said. But once she’s married and
has children to look after—

ANTONIN. Children! Don’t go too fast. Children come
pretty expensive nowadays. Troublesome, too.

MME. MAIRAUT. Never mind. Don’t cross her now. Later
on, of course, you’ll be master.

ANTONIN. I rather think so.

MME. MAIRAUT [returning to Madame Dupont] My dear
madame—

MME. DUPONT. Yes?

MME. MAIRAUT. He is afraid he may not please Mlle.
Julie.

DUPONT. Absurd!

MME. MAIRAUT. The amount of the dot, too—

DUPONT. It is my last word. [To his wife] But what is
Julie about? [He rings].

MME. DUPONT [rises] I will go and find her.

A maid enters.

DUPONT. Wait! [To the maid] Ask Mlle. Julie to come
here if she is ready.

The maid goes out.

ANTONIN. I must tell you, monsieur and madame, how
flattered I am to find that the preliminaries have been
settled between you and my parents on this important
question. I do not know what will be the issue, but—

MME. DUPONT. It is we, monsieur, who are flattered.
But you’ll see Julie in a moment. Of course she knows
nothing.

MME. MAIRAUT. We might leave them to talk a little101
together, perhaps?

MME. DUPONT. By all means. We are going to the ball
at the Gontiers’. She asked to be allowed—Here she is.
[Julie comes in. Madame Mairaut advances to meet her]
There is a crease in your dress, dear. [She takes her apart,
saying to the Mairauts] Will you excuse me?

JULIE [in a low tone] Well?

MME. DUPONT. It rests entirely with you. We are going
to leave you to talk together. Remember, it may be your
last chance. Don’t throw it away.

JULIE. I have thought it over and I don’t intend to do
as Caroline did. So if, after we have had a talk—

MME. DUPONT. You’ll have to manage him a little. He
has a great eye for business. If you could make him think
you would be useful in the bank.

JULIE. But I hate figures.

MME. DUPONT. Once married you will do as you please.
Tuck in that lace a bit. It’s a little soiled. [She tucks in
the lace of Julie’s corsage]. And remember, between lovers
there may be little things which he considers himself
entitled to.

JULIE. I understand. They can see you whispering. Go
to them. [Madame Dupont goes back to Madame Mairaut].

MME. MAIRAUT. What did she say?

MME. DUPONT. She has not the least suspicion at present.

MME. MAIRAUT. Let us leave them together. [Aloud]
My dear M. Dupont, I have long wished to go over a
printing office. May we?

DUPONT [delighted] If you will kindly come this way.

MAIRAUT. Thank you.

MME. MAIRAUT. But there really are too many of us.
[Carelessly] The children might stay here, don’t you
think, madame?

MME. DUPONT. By all means.

They go out.

102

ANTONIN [looking at the music on the piano] You are
fond of Wagner, mademoiselle.

JULIE. I adore him.

ANTONIN. So do I.

JULIE. What a genius he is.

ANTONIN. Wonderful.

JULIE. For me he is the only composer.

ANTONIN. The greatest, certainly.

JULIE. No: the only one.

ANTONIN. Perhaps so. How nice it is we should have
the same tastes in art! [Pause] Er—they have told you
nothing, I understand?

JULIE. About what?

ANTONIN. Your parents, I mean. Mine have said nothing
either.

JULIE. They have said nothing, of course, but I guessed.

ANTONIN. So did I. Then I may consider myself engaged
to you?

JULIE. Oh, not yet. We must know each other better
first.

ANTONIN. We have often danced together.

JULIE. Yes. But that’s hardly enough.

ANTONIN. It’s enough for me. Ever since the first time
I saw you at the ball at the Prefecture.

JULIE. No. It was at the band, one Sunday, that your
mother first introduced you to me.

ANTONIN. Was it? I forgot.

JULIE. I should like to know more about you. Will you—will
you let me ask you some questions? It is not usual,
perhaps, but—

ANTONIN. Certainly. Pray ask them.

JULIE. Are you fond of children?

ANTONIN. Passionately.

JULIE. Really and truly?

ANTONIN. Really and truly.

JULIE. I am quite crazy about them. For me children
mean happiness. They are the one thing worth living for103
[wistfully]. But I think I have a higher idea of marriage
than most girls. I want to have my mind satisfied as well
as my heart.

ANTONIN. So do I.

JULIE. A marriage that is a mere business partnership
seems to me horrible.

ANTONIN. Horrible! That’s just the word.

JULIE. And tell me, are you very fond of society?

ANTONIN. Not particularly. Are you?

JULIE. No.

ANTONIN. I am delighted to hear it. The fact is I am
sick to death of parties and balls. Still, if it were necessary
for business reasons: if it would help to get business for
the bank, you wouldn’t mind?

JULIE. Of course not. What kind of business do you do
at your bank?

ANTONIN. Oh, the usual kind.

JULIE. I have often read what is put up on the wall,
Current Accounts, Bourse Quotations.

ANTONIN. Coupons cashed.

JULIE. That must be very interesting.

ANTONIN. Would you take an interest in all that?

JULIE. Of course. When I was little my father used to
make me help him with his books.

ANTONIN. But now?

JULIE. Now, unfortunately, he has a clerk. I am sorry.

ANTONIN. Do you know that you are charming?

JULIE. So you told me once before.

ANTONIN. Yes: at that ball. You had on a dress just like
this one. You are beautiful. Beautiful. [He seizes her
hand].

JULIE [a little troubled] Please.

ANTONIN. Come. We are engaged, as good as married.
Give me one kiss.

JULIE. No. No.

ANTONIN. Won’t you?

JULIE [frightened] No, I tell you.

104

ANTONIN. What beautiful arms you have. [He draws
her towards him]. You remember how I adored you when
we were dancing.

JULIE. Let me go.

ANTONIN [greatly excited, in a low voice] Don’t move.
You are entrancing. [He kisses her upon the arm; she
pulls it away sharply].

JULIE. Monsieur!

ANTONIN [angry] I beg your pardon, mademoiselle.

A very long silence.

JULIE [after looking at him for some time] I have vexed
you?

ANTONIN. Well, when I see that you positively dislike
me. [Julie, after a short inward struggle, goes to him].

JULIE [putting her arm to his lips with a resigned sadness,
which she hides from him] Antonin.

ANTONIN [kissing her arm] Oh, I love you. I love you.

JULIE. Hush. They are coming back.

The Mairauts and Duponts come in again.

DUPONT. And when I have the contract from the Prefecture
I shall double my business.

MAIRAUT. Excellent. Excellent.

MME. MAIRAUT. We must be going, dear madame. We
have stayed far too long already. Are you coming, Antonin?

ANTONIN [to Julie, aloud, bowing profoundly] Mademoiselle.
[In a low voice] My beloved Julie. [To his
mother] She’s charming. I was charming, too, by the
way. Wagner, children, every kind of romantic idiocy.
And she believed me. [Aloud to Dupont] M. and Madame
Dupont, my parents will have the honor of calling
upon you to-morrow to ask on my behalf for the hand of
Mlle. Julie.

DUPONT. Till to-morrow, then. Till to-morrow. [To Antonin]
All sorts of messages to your uncle, if you see him.

ANTONIN. I shall not fail. [He bows. The Mairauts take
their leave].

105

DUPONT [to Julie] That’s all right, then?

JULIE. Yes. I really do like him. I think I managed
him pretty well too. Wagner. The bank. He thinks I’ve
a perfect passion for banking.

DUPONT [laughing] Good. You’re my own daughter.
Kiss me. And your father? He managed pretty well, I
think. I have arranged that all moneys except your dot
shall be held by you both jointly; so that if you are divorced,
or if you die after Uncle Maréchal, your dot will
come back to us, and half whatever he leaves. I call that
a good day’s work. And at dessert we’ll drink a bottle of
the best to the health of Madame Antonin Mairaut.

MME. DUPONT [embracing her] My poor little daughter.

DUPONT. Poor, indeed! She’s a very lucky girl. I
wonder where that great stupid Caroline has got to. [He
calls] Caroline. She is never here when one wants her.
[He calls again] Caroline. She is hard at work painting
Cupids on plates, I bet. [Caroline appears] Here she is.
Great news. Your sister is engaged to be married.

CAROLINE. Julie. Is it true?

JULIE. Yes.

CAROLINE. Ah!

DUPONT. Is that all you have to say?

CAROLINE. I am very glad, very glad. [She bursts into
tears].

DUPONT [astonished] What’s wrong with her? Crying!
And she’s not even asked who he is. She’s to marry M.
Antonin Mairaut, nephew of M. Maréchal.

MME. DUPONT. Don’t cry like that, my dear.

JULIE. Caroline.

CAROLINE [trying to restrain her sobs] Don’t mind me.
It is only because I love you, dear. Now you at least will
be happy.

JULIE [musing] Yes.

DUPONT [to himself] The moral of all this is that that
little affair of Angèle’s is costing me an extra five thousand
francs and my house at St. Laurent.

106-7

ACT II

The salon of a house in the country. A July night. At
the back through glass doors you see the garden brilliantly
lighted by the moon. As you look out you have two doors on
your right-hand side, and to your left, in a cross-wall, the
door of the bedroom, inside which part of the bed is visible.
The fireplace is to your right. When the curtain rises Antonin,
Courthezon and Caroline are on the stage; Caroline
is doing up a parcel.

ANTONIN. That’s settled, then, M. Courthezon. I’ll
write to the Bordeaux people about your invention this
evening.

COURTHEZON. I am greatly obliged to you, M. Antonin.
You’ll write this evening without fail, won’t you? M.
Smith is leaving tomorrow.

ANTONIN. Without fail.

COURTHEZON. Shall I post the letter for you on my way
through the town?

ANTONIN. Well—it’s rather a difficult letter to write.
It’ll take a little time. Lignol, whom you met at dinner
out in the garden, has to go back tonight. He’ll take it.

COURTHEZON. It’s very good of you.

ANTONIN. And now let’s go and have our coffee.

COURTHEZON. Not for me, thanks. I’m afraid I ought
to go by the 8.9 train. I shall be taking some china for
Mdlle. Caroline and the drawings.

ANTONIN. As you please. Good-bye, then.

108

COURTHEZON. Good-bye, M. Antonin. Thank you again.
[Antonin goes out].

CAROLINE. I shall not keep you a moment. The parcel
is just ready.

COURTHEZON. There is no hurry, mademoiselle. I can
take the next train. It’s of no importance. Indeed I prefer
it. It carries third-class passengers. The fact is I didn’t
want to go back to the others. M. and Madame. Mairaut,
M. Lignol, all those people frighten me. Besides, I’m so
happy just now I can think of nothing else.

CAROLINE. M. Antonin is going to do something about
your invention?

COURTHEZON. Yes. I have begun negotiations with a
business house at Bordeaux. M. Antonin knows the heads
of the firm, and he has been kind enough to say he will
write to them about me. But M. Smith goes away to-morrow.
That was why I was so anxious the letter should
go tonight.

CAROLINE [giving him the parcel which she has just
finished] It’s very kind of you to take charge of this. I
have put the china in it and the drawings they asked for.
You will make my apologies to the firm, won’t you? I
have not been very well.

COURTHEZON. Not well?

CAROLINE. Nothing serious. But the doctor said a little
country air would be good for me, so Julie and her husband
asked me here. They have been very kind. I have
been with them a week, and I’m feeling ever so much
better.

COURTHEZON. They would hardly have left you in your
lodgings with no one to look after you. [Pause]. What
a strange idea it was of yours to go off and live by yourself
like that!

CAROLINE. I thought it better. After Julie’s marriage
I preferred it.

COURTHEZON. It must cost more.

CAROLINE [shrugs] I daresay. [Pause]. You are go109ing
to have a lovely night for your journey. How bright
the moon is! One can see as clearly as if it were broad
daylight.

COURTHEZON [suddenly remembering] There now! I
was just going to forget! I brought a letter for M. Dupont
from the office. It came after he left. It’s about the
printing contract for the Prefecture.

CAROLINE. For the Prefecture. He’ll want to see that
directly he comes in.

COURTHEZON. And now I really must be off. Good-bye,
Mlle. Caro.

CAROLINE. Good-bye, M. Courthezon. [He goes out].

After Courthezon’s departure Caroline returns to her
seat. She makes a slight sign of the cross, closes her eyes
and sits motionless, praying silently. After a few seconds
she again crosses herself, but does all this very quietly.
Lignol comes in through the glass doors, giving his arm
to Julie. Antonin and M. and Madame Mairaut follow.

ANTONIN. We shall be more comfortable here than in
the garden. It’s getting rather chilly. [To Lignol] You
can smoke.

LIGNOL. We really could have stayed out quite well.

ANTONIN. And given Julie cold, eh?

JULIE. My dear, I assure you—

ANTONIN. Oh, yes, I know. But you aren’t wrapped up
enough. [He touches her arm] In that thin dress you’ve
simply nothing on. Just feel, Lignol, feel.

JULIE [protesting] My dear!

MME. MAIRAUT. What a charming frock you have on,
my dear. Quite delightful.

JULIE. It came from Madame Raimond.

MME. MAIRAUT [to Mairaut] From Madame Raimond?
I thought she made all her own dresses.

LIGNOL [to Julie] You know, madame, that you have
not convinced me yet.

JULIE. Admitting that I am wrong—[They go towards
the garden door with Antonin, talking].

110

MME. MAIRAUT [to Mairaut] And you urged on that
marriage.

MAIRAUT. I!

MME. MAIRAUT. When she was at home she never went
to a dressmaker. And now! It’s too much. And we shall
have the river in here before long. That wall is bound
to go.

MAIRAUT. Do you think so?

MME. MAIRAUT. We shall have the whole house about
our ears. And that fool—

MAIRAUT. What fool?

MME. MAIRAUT. Your son, of course, who has put in electric
light.

ANTONIN [from the garden door, to Lignol] You didn’t
know I’d had electric light put in. We have lots of water
power, you see. I ought to have turned it on before.
Look. [He touches a button and turns up the light].

LIGNOL. That’s better. [They talk on].

MME. MAIRAUT. If the river rises another couple of
inches down will come four hundred feet of that wall.

MAIRAUT. It’s not as bad as that.

MME. MAIRAUT. Oh, you have let yourself be nicely
done.

MAIRAUT. Come, come.

MME. MAIRAUT. The girl is utterly useless. She can do
nothing. And the house will cost more in repairs than it
is worth. When I think I was idiot enough to listen to
you. [She listens]. What was that?

MAIRAUT. I hear nothing.

MME. MAIRAUT. The wall! Listen! [They listen intently].

JULIE [coming forward with Lignol and Antonin] Oh,
yes, we’re comfortable enough here, as you see.

MME. MAIRAUT. Comfortable enough! [To Mairaut]
Come with me. This way. I am certain the wall has fallen.
If it has we must have a little talk with the Duponts;
and I, for one, shan’t mince matters. [Turning to the
others] My husband finds the heat a little too much for111
him. We are going for another turn in the garden. Oh,
it’s nothing, nothing at all.

MAIRAUT [mumbling] Nothing. Giddy, that’s all.

ANTONIN. Quite right. Get all the fresh air you can
while you are in the country. Don’t be long. We’re expecting
visitors, you know.

MME. MAIRAUT. We’ll be back in time. [Madame Mairaut
and Mairaut go out into the garden].

ANTONIN. Here, you see, is the staircase which leads to
the upstairs rooms and down to the garden. [He goes to
the door on his left]. Here is our bedroom.

JULIE [in a low voice, so as not to be noticed by Lignol]
Antonin!

ANTONIN [aloud] Nonsense, dear. Why not? [He
opens the door. To Lignol] Look.

LIGNOL. Charming.

ANTONIN. A real nest, eh? A nest for love-birds. That’s
what I call it. [To his wife] Kiss me, dear.

JULIE. But—

ANTONIN. Kiss me. Come.

JULIE [gently] But we’re not alone.

ANTONIN. Lignol won’t mind. Eh, Lignol?

LIGNOL [laughs] Don’t mention it. You weren’t so shy
at dinner.

ANTONIN [to Julie, smiling] Come. Wives must obey,
you know. [She kisses him]. And now go and see about
that beer.

JULIE. Mayn’t I send the servant?

ANTONIN. She doesn’t know where it is. It’s not unpacked
yet. [To Lignol] It’s a wedding present. We are
going to broach it tonight.

LIGNOL. Not for me. I must go in a moment.

ANTONIN. I wasn’t thinking of you, my dear fellow.
You’re a friend. These formal entertainments are reserved
for acquaintances. For the Pouchelets, in fact. M.
Pouchelet has just been elected a Departmental Councillor.
He and his wife are paying their first visit here
tonight.

112

LIGNOL. So late?

ANTONIN. On their way back from the Préfet’s. They
are dining there, and we are near neighbors. They are
very well off, very influential. Useful people altogether.
What was I saying? [To Julie] Oh yes, the beer: that girl
will never be able to find it. Besides, I’d rather you went.
She would only break the bottles. [Julie pouts]. Wives
must obey, you know.

JULIE. Very well. I shall be back before you go, M. Lignol.
[She goes out].

CAROLINE [to Antonin] You won’t forget the letter for
M. Courthezon, will you, M. Antonin.

ANTONIN. Of course not.

CAROLINE. If you write I feel sure he will succeed.

ANTONIN. Yes, yes, I know.

CAROLINE. I will go to Julie.

ANTONIN. You’d much better go and put on another
dress or something. Just to smarten yourself up. The
Pouchelets are coming. We must all look our best.

CAROLINE [rather aghast, looking at her clothes] But—[A
pause]. Very well. [She goes out].

LIGNOL. Who is that lady? She never spoke a word all
through dinner.

ANTONIN [carelessly] A poor relation. The usual thing,
an old maid, always at church. Awfully prim and proper,
you know. [Rather shamefaced] In fact—I don’t mind
telling you—she really works for her living.

LIGNOL. Well, why not? There’s nothing dishonorable
about that, is there?

ANTONIN. I know. But still—She paints little Cupids
and that kind of thing, on china. [He laughs loudly].
Enough to make you split! You don’t see it? The other
day someone offered her some work far better paid than
what she’s doing at present. She refused. Guess why.

LIGNOL [bored] Why?

ANTONIN [giggling] Because the woman who kept the
shop was divorced. [He laughs]. But it is good to see you113
again, my dear chap. [He claps Lignol on the shoulder].
Awfully good.

LIGNOL. I’ve enjoyed coming immensely. [A pause].
Your wife is charming.

ANTONIN [fatuously] Not bad, eh!

LIGNOL. And she’s clever, too.

ANTONIN. Get out!

LIGNOL. I’m quite serious.

ANTONIN. Oh, yes, I dare say. I know all about that.
No use denying it. Julie’s stupid. It was partly for that
very reason I married her.

LIGNOL. I don’t think so. She has read a lot.

ANTONIN. Read! Oh, yes, she’s read! She reads everything
she comes across. Before her marriage she read the
proofs of everything her father printed. Here she has unearthed
a lot of books left behind by an old fool M.
Dupont bought the house from. She’s read them all.

LIGNOL. But then—

ANTONIN. But she doesn’t understand a word of what
she reads. Not a word! The other day I looked at the
author’s name on the book in her hand. It was Mill. You
know, John Stuart Mill.

LIGNOL [nods] Yes, I know.

ANTONIN. So do I, by name. But I’ve never read him,
thank goodness. No, I tell you Julie’s stupid. But she’s
pretty and she knows how to put on her clothes. I knew
what I was about when I married her. With a little instruction
from me she’ll learn to manage the house well
enough. And that’s all I ask of a woman.

LIGNOL. Indeed. Well, my dear chap, if you imagine
you’ve married a stupid woman you’re mistaken.

ANTONIN. How do you know?

LIGNOL. She and I have been talking while you were
entertaining your inventor.

ANTONIN. You got her to talk, did you?

LIGNOL. Certainly.

ANTONIN. Wonders will never cease. When we’re alone114
she never has a word to say.

LIGNOL. And you?

ANTONIN. I haven’t either.

LIGNOL. That’s awkward.

ANTONIN. I’m always afraid of putting my foot in it.
The fact is I don’t understand Julie.

LIGNOL. And you’ve been married five months.

ANTONIN. Four months and a week over. But then I’m
at business all the week. Every Saturday her parents and
mine come down to spend Sunday with us. M. and Madame
Dupont couldn’t get here in time for dinner tonight,
but they’ll be here soon. When we are alone I try
to find some subject of conversation, but I tell you it’s
like walking on eggshells. Whew! And so—

LIGNOL. Well?

ANTONIN. And so I stop. And then I kiss her.

LIGNOL. You’re tremendously in love with her.

ANTONIN. Yes.

LIGNOL. And she?

ANTONIN. She’s just the same.

LIGNOL. Happy man!

ANTONIN. For the rest we can only wait and see how
things turn out. She knows nothing of my tastes. I know
nothing of hers.

LIGNOL. And what did you talk about while you were
engaged?

ANTONIN. We were only engaged three weeks. Just
long enough to get the money matters settled.

LIGNOL. You took good care about them, I bet.

ANTONIN. Rather. In fact it was a precious good stroke
of business. [He laughs]. If you only knew how we did
the Duponts, maman and I! [He laughs again].

LIGNOL. Hush. Here’s your wife. [Julie comes in, and
Lignol rises to go]. I am afraid I must be going, madame.

ANTONIN. But my letter for Courthezon. [He looks at
his watch]. You’ve twenty minutes still.

LIGNOL. You’re sure?

115

ANTONIN. Certain. Wait a second. I’ll go and write it,
and then I’ll see you to the station. It’s only a step. [He
goes out].

JULIE. Thanks to you, M. Lignol, we have had a delightful
evening.

LIGNOL. You flatter me, dear madame. I know quite
well I have been in the way.

JULIE. On the contrary. I have not had such an evening’s
conversation since I married.

LIGNOL. Antonin isn’t a great talker.

JULIE. You are old friends, aren’t you?

LIGNOL. Yes. I’ve known him fifteen years. We are almost
like brothers.

JULIE. Tell me. Is he what you would call a religious
man?

LIGNOL. Antonin! [Bursts out laughing]. Why, he’s
a materialist. Not much idealism about him.

JULIE. Indeed! Not much idealism! But he’s fond of
music? Good music I mean: Wagner?

LIGNOL. He likes a brass band or a comic opera. [Julie
shows surprise]. You are astonished? Oh, I forgot. He
plays a little on the concertina. My dear madame, Antonin
is a good chap but thoroughly matter of fact. Prosaic.

JULIE [laughing] You are not very complimentary to
your friends.

LIGNOL. What annoys me is that he should possess a
treasure like you and should seem quite unconscious of
its value. Ah, when I marry—

JULIE. You are going to marry soon?

LIGNOL. I don’t know. [Musingly] If I were to meet a
woman like you, a woman with whom I could discuss
everything in heaven and earth, everything that raises
us, makes us higher, then—

JULIE. Look for her. You’ll find her easily enough.

LIGNOL. And beautiful, too. Beautiful as you are. For
you are beautiful, you know.

116

JULIE [still rallying him] Are you making love to me
by any chance, M. Lignol?

LIGNOL. If making love to you means yielding to an
overmastering attraction—to a fascination—

JULIE [laughing] You certainly make the most of your
time as friend of the family. But I shouldn’t hurry if I were
you. You will only be wasting a lot of pretty speeches
which you could employ to greater advantage elsewhere.
I have old-fashioned views on the subject of marriage.

LIGNOL. Whatever they are I am sure they will be lofty
and noble.

JULIE. You are too good. But you are mistaken. My
view is commonplace enough. All I ask of life is that I
may love my children and love my husband.

LIGNOL. Your children?

JULIE [quite simply, with a touch of emotion] Above
everything my children. What I am going to say will
sound absurd to you, but the day my first child is born will
be the happiest day of my life. So you see, M. Lignol—

LIGNOL [insinuatingly] Dear madame, we shall meet
again.

JULIE [smiling] As soon as you please.

Antonin comes in.

ANTONIN. Here’s the letter. You’ll slip it into the post-box,
won’t you? And now we’ve only just time.

LIGNOL. I’m ready [rising briskly]. But don’t let me
drag you to the station. You’ll be leaving madame alone.

ANTONIN. That’s all right. Come along. I can see if M.
and Madame Dupont have arrived at the same time.

LIGNOL [to Julie] Au revoir, madame. [To Antonin]
I am sorry not to say good-bye to mademoiselle. [Antonin
is puzzled]. To the lady who dined with us.

ANTONIN. Oh, Caro. I’ll say it for you. No, here she is.
[Caroline comes in; and, as Lignol is saying good-bye to
her, M. and Madame Dupont appear. Antonin hurriedly
introduces] My friend Lignol. He has to catch this train.

LIGNOL. So sorry. [He goes out with Antonin].

117

DUPONT. Ah, Caroline. There you are. I have good
news for you. Your aunt is dead. Your aunt in India.
She has left all her money to you and Angèle. Not much.
Sixty thousand francs between you. I get nothing, of
course. She never could endure me. My dear girl, what’s
the matter? Come, come, you’re not going to cry because
your aunt is dead! You’ve not seen her for five and twenty
years. It’s the greatest stroke of luck for you. And I
shall have all the trouble, as usual! [A gesture of dissent
from Caroline]. Oh, yes, I shall. Your sister will have to
come down from Paris.

MME. DUPONT. I thought you said she was in India.

DUPONT. In India! What are you talking about? She
is in Paris. She has never been anywhere except in Paris.
What should take her to India? [To Caroline] Your
sister Angèle will have to come down from Paris because
part of the money is in land. It will be sold, of course, but
still I shall have to see Angèle. And that will set people
talking. Lots of people don’t even know that I have
three daughters. [To Julie] It’s lucky for you this didn’t
happen before your marriage, Julie.

CAROLINE. Must she come, father?

DUPONT. Certainly she must. You must both be present
at the lawyer’s together to sign the documents.

CAROLINE. I will not go the lawyer’s.

DUPONT. If you refuse to go Angèle will not be able to
get her legacy, and she needs it.

CAROLINE. Well, perhaps I will go. I will think it over
and consult someone. I will give you my answer tomorrow.

DUPONT. As you please. And not a word about this,
remember, either of you.

JULIE. Very well, father.

CAROLINE [taking a letter from the mantelpiece] Courthezon
brought this letter for you. It is about the printing
work for the Prefecture.

DUPONT [He reads the letter]. Done, by Jove! Du118moulin
gets the contract! Dumoulin! I expected this. I
expected it. Uncle Maréchal has done it on purpose, curse
him! [To Julie] How long have I been telling you you
ought to pay him a visit. Have you been? No. And
Antonin? Not he! Nor his father and mother! The old
fool is offended, and this is his revenge. And if this goes
on we shall never get a halfpenny of his money. Why
haven’t you been to see him?

JULIE. Antonin’s parents didn’t wish it.

DUPONT. Ah! They didn’t wish it! Well, I have a word
or two to say to Antonin’s parents, you’ll see. I do my
duty, I go and call on Uncle Maréchal myself. I amuse
the old idiot, though it’s not the pleasantest sort of job
to have to do. They didn’t wish it! I’ll show them the
kind of man I am! And you—you were fool enough to do
what they told you! I find a husband for you, a far better
match than you could ever have hoped for. I do the Mairauts—

MME. DUPONT [alarmed, looking round her] Hush!

DUPONT. Well, haven’t I done the Mairauts?

MME. DUPONT. Yes, yes. But don’t say it so loud.

DUPONT. They aren’t here. And if they were, Julie’s
married now. [Speaking lower, but with the same fury]
I do the Mairauts—

MME. DUPONT. Are you quite sure?

DUPONT. Am I quite sure? Haven’t I done them? I
tell you I’ve done them brown!

The maid-servant comes in.

SERVANT [to Julie] It’s about the beer, madame.

JULIE. I’m coming. Will you come, too, Caro? [Julie
and Caroline go out].

DUPONT [fuming] Brown, by jove!

MME. DUPONT. Hush. Here they are.

DUPONT. I’m glad to hear it. Now you’ll see.

M. and Madame Mairaut come in.

MME. MAIRAUT. Ah, you are here. Well, the wall has
come down.

119

DUPONT. I’m not thinking about the wall.

MME. MAIRAUT. Very likely. You haven’t to pay for
putting it up again.

DUPONT. I’m not thinking about the wall. I’m thinking
of something far more important. M. and Madame
Mairaut, I regret to have to inform you that you are
either deplorably unintelligent or else devoid of all sense
of parental duty.

MME. MAIRAUT. Indeed! So it’s you who propose to insult
us just when—

DUPONT. I am a father and I love my children. When
their interests are at stake I have the sense to keep on
good terms with those who may be useful to them later
on.

MME. MAIRAUT [after a moment’s thought] I see. Uncle
Maréchal?

DUPONT. You knew it. You did it on purpose!

MME. MAIRAUT. Uncle Maréchal! [She bursts out laughing
uproariously].

MAIRAUT. Charlotte. My dear. Don’t laugh like that.

MME. MAIRAUT. Why shouldn’t I laugh? You aren’t
going to forbid me, I suppose, [looking full at Dupont
and laughing more] nor monsieur.

DUPONT. Well, since you take it like that, I propose to
give you my view of the situation. Either you are hopelessly
selfish or else you are hopelessly stupid.

MAIRAUT. Monsieur Dupont!

MME. MAIRAUT. You hold your tongue. Leave me to
deal with him.

MME. DUPONT. My dear—

DUPONT. Be silent. Selfish or stupid? Which? [Madame
Mairaut shrugs her shoulders]. Is Uncle Maréchal
a man with money to leave, or is he not?

MME. MAIRAUT [decisively, after a moment’s thought]
He is not!

DUPONT [staggered] He is not? But—

MME. MAIRAUT. I quite understand, and you have your120
answer. He is not.

DUPONT. He has not two hundred thousand francs?

MME. MAIRAUT. He had them. Somebody else has them
now. He has lost them.

DUPONT. Lost them! If this is true—

MME. MAIRAUT. That is why we don’t waste our time
in going to see him.

DUPONT. But—I don’t understand. [A pause. He controls
himself]. How long ago did this happen?

MME. MAIRAUT. More than six months ago.

DUPONT. More than six months? Then you knew.

MME. MAIRAUT. Yes, we knew.

DUPONT. And you never told me.

MME. MAIRAUT. You didn’t ask us.

DUPONT. You ought to have informed me. It was dishonest.

MME. MAIRAUT. Monsieur!

DUPONT. You have swindled me.

MME. MAIRAUT. Swindled!

DUPONT. Yes. Swindled.

MME. MAIRAUT. Nonsense. We are as well off as you
are, I hope. Our bank is worth as much as your printing
business.

DUPONT. Most people wouldn’t say so. As to that, by
the way, I should like to ask you—

MME. MAIRAUT. No, monsieur. I have nothing further
to say to you. And I am now going to inform my son how
you have treated us.

MME. DUPONT. Madame Mairaut!

MME. MAIRAUT. Are you coming, Alfred?

Mairaut makes a gesture of regret and distress behind
his wife’s back, and then follows her out.

MME. DUPONT. This is terrible.

DUPONT. Eh! [Pulling himself together]. No! On
reflection I’m inclined to think it’s the best thing that
could have happened. I regret nothing. Rather the contrary.

121

MME. DUPONT. I don’t understand.

DUPONT. Naturally! You don’t understand. You will
later. [Julie comes in]. We were just speaking of you.
I hear your husband’s business is shaky. Is it?

JULIE. I know nothing about it.

DUPONT. You know, I suppose, whether it is true that
he got let in by the Bourdin failure?

JULIE. No.

DUPONT. Good Heavens! What on earth do you talk
about, at meals, and so on?

JULIE. We don’t talk at all.

DUPONT. Still you must have noticed whether he was
anxious and preoccupied, or whether he was in his usual
spirits.

JULIE. I’ve no idea what his usual spirits are. I’ve only
known him six months.

DUPONT. You’d better ask him how things are going at
once.

JULIE. What’s the good?

DUPONT. You must ask him. You will have children
some day, I suppose?

JULIE [with a sigh] If it weren’t for that, I think I should
go and drown myself.

DUPONT. That would be absurd. But we needn’t discuss
that now. Only, if you don’t wish your children to be beggars,
keep an eye on your husband’s business affairs.

JULIE. Very well. I will.

Antonin comes in.

ANTONIN [in a tone of mild reproach] M. Dupont, this is
very annoying. Here are my parents coming to me to
complain that you have called them swindlers. I must say
it’s pretty hard on me if I can’t even spend a Sunday in
the country in peace. From the moment you arrive on
Saturday night you begin quarrelling. And now—swindlers!
Come, come, M. Dupont, that’s not the sort of name
one calls people, is it? They are very angry, and I don’t
blame them.

122

DUPONT. Oh, it was really nothing.

ANTONIN. Maman is furious.

DUPONT. That’s absurd of her. You know what it is
when people begin disputing; one word leads to another,
and one says things one only half believes. However, to
show how reasonable I am, I will go and make my apologies
to Madame Mairaut. [To Madame Dupont] Come,
my dear: you must do the talking.

ANTONIN. If you put yourself in my place, you will see
how unpleasant this kind of thing is.

DUPONT [with dignity] Quite so. [He and Madame
Dupont turn towards the door].

ANTONIN [calling them back] Here are M. and Madame
Pouchelet. Wait. [He goes to the door and calls to his
parents] Maman! They’re here, and M. Dupont wants
to apologize. It was a misunderstanding, and please don’t
let’s have any quarrelling before visitors. [To Julie] Go
and help them to get their things off.

Julie goes out to welcome the arrivals. M. and Madame
Mairaut come in at the same moment as M. and Madame
Pouchelet, Julie helping the latter to take off their wraps.
M. Pouchelet is in evening dress, Madame Pouchelet in a
ball dress.

JULIE. How good of you to come. My husband and I
are so delighted.

POUCHELET. I promised your husband we would look
in. Otherwise we should have gone straight home. The
Préfet kept us longer than we wished, and we neither of
us like late hours. We can only stay a moment.

MME. MAIRAUT [pushing forward a chair for Madame
Pouchelet] Won’t you sit down?

ANTONIN [to Pouchelet] Naturally the Préfet was only
too glad to get you to come.

POUCHELET. Yes. There is a scheme on foot for reclassifying
the roads in the Department.

ANTONIN [with an assumption of great interest] Really!

MME. MAIRAUT [following suit] Reclassifying the roads.123
Most interesting.

ANTONIN. It is a matter of the greatest importance.
And you, of course, are the very man to give him the
necessary information.

POUCHELET [pompously] I flatter myself I do know
something of the subject.

DUPONT. It is a question I have also had a great deal to
do with. Twelve years ago I printed—

POUCHELET. I intend to make—

DUPONT. No; it was thirteen—

MME. MAIRAUT [to her husband] Listen, dear: M. Pouchelet
is speaking.

MAIRAUT. Yes, yes; I am listening.

POUCHELET. I intend to make an important speech on
the subject at the Council. But you will read the report
in the papers.

ANTONIN. I should think so. We must not miss that,
Julie, must we?

POUCHELET. Oh, madame, I’m afraid my speech is not
likely to interest you.

ANTONIN. On the contrary. My wife only likes reading
about serious subjects. Why the other day I found her
reading—who was it? that English writer: what was his
name, dearest?

JULIE. Never mind.

ANTONIN [going over to Julie, summing up her points]
She’s a wonderful little woman, my wife. Aren’t you,
dearest? You aren’t cold, are you? I am always telling
you you don’t wrap up enough. [To Pouchelet] She is
charming, isn’t she? And the most devoted wife! [To
Julie] Aren’t you a devoted wife, dear?

MME. MAIRAUT. Antonin, aren’t you going to offer M.
and Madame Pouchelet a little refreshment?

ANTONIN. Of course. [To his wife] Will you ring?

Julie rings the bell. The maid comes in almost at once
with bottles of beer on a tray, and glasses.

JULIE [to the maid] Put it there.

124

ANTONIN [to Madame Pouchelet] My wife is a wonderful
manager. We are really hardly settled in here. Yet
everything is always ready directly one wants it. May I
give you a glass of beer?

The glasses which Julie has poured out are handed
round. Caroline comes in.

DUPONT. M. Pouchelet, allow me to present to you my
second daughter, Caroline.

POUCHELET [bows] Madame.

ANTONIN [correcting him] Mademoiselle. Mlle. Caroline
has always refused to marry. She prefers to devote
her life to her art.

MME. POUCHELET. You are an artist, mademoiselle?
How delightful. I adore artists.

CAROLINE. I only paint a little on china.

ANTONIN. And she does it most beautifully.

POUCHELET. You must send something to our local exhibition.

ANTONIN. Excellent! M. Pouchelet is right. Why have
you never sent anything?

CAROLINE. I only paint china plates, knick-knacks and
so on.

ANTONIN. Just for your own amusement. [To Pouchelet]
My sister-in-law just does it to amuse herself. But
I am sure if she took the trouble—

CAROLINE. But I don’t do it to amuse myself.

MME. MAIRAUT. Oh, yes, you do.

ANTONIN. Merely to amuse yourself.

DUPONT. Just for your own amusement.

ANTONIN. And the artist can put just as much of his
art into small subjects. Look at Meissonier.

MME. POUCHELET. Of course. They give just as great
scope for the imagination.

CAROLINE. But I only copy what the people at the shop
send me.

MME. MAIRAUT. Another glass of beer, Madame Pouchelet?
It is French beer and can’t—

125

MME. POUCHELET. Not just now, thank you. [To Caroline]
The shop people, mademoiselle?

CAROLINE. Yes, madame, the people who keep the shop
I work for. They pay me quite good wages for what I do.

MME. POUCHELET. I see. [A silence].

ANTONIN [sotto voce, taking Caroline a glass of beer] Be
silent, can’t you?

CAROLINE [to him, puzzled] What is it?

ANTONIN [to Madame Pouchelet, leading her up to a
picture] Madame Pouchelet, you understand pictures, I
know. What do you think of this? I paid a long price
for it. [They go on talking].

CAROLINE [to Madame Mairaut, in a low voice] Have I
done anything I shouldn’t?

MME. MAIRAUT [drily] Oh no! Far from it! [She rises
and goes over to Madame Pouchelet].

MME. POUCHELET [coming down stage with Antonin] I
don’t care much about pictures unless they tell a story.
What is that one about?

JULIE. It is an engraving of a picture by Gerard Dow.

MME. POUCHELET. Never heard of him.

JULIE. He was a Dutch painter. Seventeenth century.

MME. POUCHELET. Really. But of course you know
more about these things than I do. A propos, M. Dupont,
did you go to the lecture the other day on women’s rights?

POUCHELET [laughing] Oh, yes, ha! ha!

MME. POUCHELET [to Julie] I shouldn’t be surprised if
you, madame, had some sympathy with such opinions?

JULIE [evasively] I don’t know.

ANTONIN [laughing] Come, confess, my dear. Just a
little, perhaps?

MME. MAIRAUT. Woman the equal of man!

JULIE [mildly] Why not?

MAIRAUT. There are some women who wouldn’t gain
much by that.

MME. DUPONT. But not all.

DUPONT. Women lawyers!

126

MME. POUCHELET. Women doctors!

POUCHELET. Women with votes!

ANTONIN [laughing] What a joke.

DUPONT [laughing] Women with votes!

POUCHELET. I call that rich. [All three are convulsed
with merriment].

DUPONT. Think of it. Women in the Chamber of Deputies!

ANTONIN. Women Senators!

POUCHELET. Women in the Ministry!

DUPONT. In the Chamber they would want to keep
their hats on.

POUCHELET. Yes [to Julie]. Eh, Madame Mairaut?
They’d insist on keeping on their hats as they do at the
theatres.

MME. POUCHELET. And at election times they’d go
from house to house asking for votes. The modern women
would enjoy that.

POUCHELET. And this parliament elected by women,
what would it be like? [More laughter]. A Chamber of
Deputies chosen by women!

JULIE [a little annoyed] Really, gentlemen, judging by
the results you’ve achieved so far by keeping the government
to yourselves I don’t think you need fear that women
will do much worse. [The laughter dies down uneasily].

POUCHELET [with pompous solemnity] I know it is the
fashion nowadays to decry all our elective assemblies.
But, as I am myself, in my humble way, one of the people’s
representatives, I cannot allow such views to pass without
protest. [An awful silence].

JULIE [apologizing] I had no intention of saying anything
that could wound you, M. Pouchelet.

MME. POUCHELET. We are sure of that, dear madame.

POUCHELET [to his wife] And now, my dear, it is time
for us to be going.

ANTONIN. You must forgive my wife’s little slip, dear127
monsieur.

POUCHELET. It is nothing—nothing at all.

ANTONIN. You mustn’t go like this. Another glass of
beer?

MME. POUCHELET. You are very good. It has been so
close to-day.

ANTONIN. Julie, a glass of beer for Madame Pouchelet.
[To her] Yes; the heat this afternoon has been quite
oppressive. [To Julie] Where’s that beer?

JULIE [who has tried the various bottles, confused] I will
send for some more. These are empty.

ANTONIN. Really!

MME. POUCHELET. Oh, please don’t trouble. Please. No;
you really must not. We can have something when we get
home. [Going] Our things are here, I think.

JULIE. Let me help you.

ANTONIN. I will come and put you on your way.

POUCHELET [declining] Thank you, monsieur. We
know the way.

M. and Madame Pouchelet bow formally and coldly to
each in turn and go out: Julie goes with them. There is a
silence. Antonin paces the room irritably. Madame Mairaut
grins.

DUPONT [to his wife, in a low voice, after glancing at the
others] I think it’s time we went to bed.

MME. DUPONT. Very well, dear.

Formal bows, Monsieur, Madame, are exchanged. The
Duponts go out and Julie returns.

ANTONIN [his arms folded, sternly] So there was no more
beer.

JULIE. No, dear.

ANTONIN. It’s intolerable.

JULIE. Here are the three bottles. You told me to buy
three bottles. There they are.

ANTONIN. Nonsense. You make me ridiculous. I press
Madame Pouchelet to have another glass and there isn’t
one. It’s preposterous.

128

JULIE. It is not my fault.

ANTONIN. I suppose you think it’s mine.

MME. MAIRAUT. Evidently.

ANTONIN. Besides, I have no recollection of saying three
bottles.

JULIE. I assure you.

ANTONIN. I have no recollection whatever of it. On the
contrary, I am certain I said buy four or five.

JULIE. No. Three.

ANTONIN. You make me look like a fool. These people
will think I was laughing at them. You make me look like
a fool, and that is a thing I won’t have.

CAROLINE. M. Antonin, I was there when you spoke to
Julie. You did say three bottles.

ANTONIN. My dear Caroline, I love you very much, but
I can’t help pointing out to you that the best possible way
to aggravate a dispute between husband and wife is to interfere
in it either on one side or on the other. If you
don’t realize that already, you may take it from me.

MME. MAIRAUT. If you spoke less, mademoiselle, it would
certainly be better for all parties.

CAROLINE. Why? What have I said?

ANTONIN. Among other things you might refrain from
proclaiming on the housetops that you are reduced to
working for your living.

CAROLINE. There is nothing dishonorable in that.

MME. MAIRAUT. Very likely. But one doesn’t talk about
it.

ANTONIN. I thought every moment you were going to
ask M. Pouchelet for an order. Not very pleasant for us,
that.

CAROLINE. I am sorry. I didn’t mean to do anything
wrong. [She begins to cry]. But I’m so unfortunate. I
always make mistakes.

ANTONIN [irritably] Oh, for goodness sake, my dear
Caroline, don’t begin to cry. There’s no earthly good in
that.

129

MME. MAIRAUT. There’s really nothing to cry about.

JULIE [going to her] Caroline. Don’t cry, dear. [She
takes her away].

MME. MAIRAUT. Now, my son, we are going to say good-night.

ANTONIN. Good-night. [He kisses her absently].

MME. MAIRAUT. You’re not angry with us, dear, are you?
You wanted to marry Julie, you know. Good-night.

M. and Madame Mairaut go out. Antonin, left alone,
goes to the bell and rings it. The maid comes in.

ANTONIN [to the servant] Put out the lights. You can
leave the two on the mantelpiece. Close those shutters.
[The maid does so and goes out. Julie returns]. I have
something to say to you.

JULIE. I am listening.

ANTONIN. I do not wish Caroline to remain with us any
longer.

JULIE. Why? What has she done?

ANTONIN. You know well enough.

JULIE. No, I do not.

ANTONIN. She gets on my nerves.

JULIE. Explain, please.

ANTONIN. It is not my business to give explanations. I
am the master in my own house. I shall be obliged if you
will arrange with Caroline to bring her visit to a close on
Monday.

JULIE. But she was to stay till the end of the month.
She will want to know why. What am I to say to her?

ANTONIN. Whatever you please.

JULIE. She will be hurt.

ANTONIN. I don’t care about that.

JULIE. But I do care.

ANTONIN. If you won’t tell her I will, in a way which
won’t admit of any misunderstanding.

JULIE. She will be angry.

ANTONIN. Let her.

JULIE. But if you two quarrel where shall I be able to130
see her? Here?

ANTONIN. No. I forbid you to do so.

JULIE. Have you the right to forbid me?

ANTONIN. Certainly.

JULIE. Why?

ANTONIN. Once more, because I am master here: because
the husband is the master in his own house.

JULIE. That was not what you told me while we were
engaged.

ANTONIN. I dare say.

JULIE. You have nothing more to say to me?

ANTONIN. Yes; I have.

JULIE. Well?

ANTONIN. When you have opinions of the outrageous
description you gave vent to this evening, please keep
them to yourself.

JULIE. Haven’t I the right to have opinions?

ANTONIN. Nonsense. Once for all, I have made up my
mind that you shall obey me and not spoil my prospects.
M. and Madame Pouchelet are people of importance.
They might be useful to me, and if you offend them with
your absurdities you will be wanting in your duty. Marriage
is a business partnership.

JULIE. Then I want to see the accounts. They say you
are doing badly at the bank. Is that true?

ANTONIN. Women know nothing about such things.
You look after your household and leave the rest to me.
Under the terms of our marriage the management of our
affairs is in my hands. I manage them to the best of my
ability. That is all I have to say to you.

JULIE. In other words, I am a business partner who has
to keep her eyes shut and say nothing.

ANTONIN. My dear, it’s quite useless starting the lecture
about women’s rights all over again. I heard it the other
evening. Leave that sort of thing to old maids with beards.
If I were willing to listen to you, you’d reel off the whole
catalogue of grievances against the laws which make131
women slaves. I know.

JULIE. No: it is not a question of law. It is a question
of social usage. [A pause]. What is wrong is not that
there is such and such a provision in the Code. The real
evil is that our parents married us as they did marry us.

ANTONIN. They did as most parents do.

JULIE. And so most marriages are unhappy.

ANTONIN. If you really loved me—

JULIE. But I don’t love you. That is just the point. And
you don’t love me. And here we are chained to one another.

ANTONIN. Nonsense. I not love you?

JULIE. No, indeed. You don’t love me.

ANTONIN. Come, come, you are talking foolishly. It’s
late. Let’s go to bed. Things will be all right to-morrow
morning. [He goes into the bedroom].

JULIE [sits staring in front of her for awhile: then she
says to herself] No: things will never be all right. Never.
Never.

ANTONIN [calls] Are you coming, Julie? [Julie starts
as if she had been dreaming. She looks round her in a dazed
way]. Come along.

JULIE [with a deep sigh, her face showing a mingled expression
of profound disgust and sorrowful resignation] I
am coming. [She goes slowly towards the door of the bedroom].



132-3

ACT III

The scene is the same as in the first Act. It is September.
Dupont and his wife are sitting together. There is a pile of
account books on the table between them.

DUPONT [to his wife, who is holding a paper] You see
what the accounts say. They aren’t brilliant. [To the
maid who enters] As soon as Mlle. Caroline comes in ask
her to come here.

SERVANT. Yes, sir. [The maid goes out].

MME. DUPONT. The turnover is smaller than last year.

DUPONT. The profits are down to nothing. I’m wrong.
112 francs 17. Splendid things accounts!

MME. DUPONT. What’s to happen next?

DUPONT. I don’t know. One thing is certain. Things
can’t go on like this.

MME. DUPONT. What are we to do, then?

DUPONT. Next year it will be worse, unless—

MME. DUPONT. Unless?

DUPONT. The fact is the business wants new plant. At
present we are using an old machine worked by hand,
which I inherited from my father. We have a gas engine
not worth twopence. In fact, there’s only one hope for us.

MME. DUPONT. What is that?

DUPONT. To get fresh capital somehow.

MME. DUPONT. That’s not very likely.

DUPONT. Who knows? It’s lucky for you your husband
is no fool, my dear. I am going to see if I can get you out134
of this mess. [Caroline comes in]. Here is Caroline. Go
and find Julie. I shall want you both in a moment. I will
call you.

Madame Dupont goes out.

DUPONT [to Caroline] My dear child, I have asked you
to come here because I want to have a serious talk with
you. After our long arguments you have at last come to
see that it is your duty to accept the legacy from your
aunt. Your sister Angèle is coming here.

CAROLINE. Coming here?

DUPONT. But that is another matter. We will discuss
that in a moment with Julie and her mother. They are in
the next room. At present I am speaking only of you. All
difficulties are removed now—I had a lot of trouble over
it, by the way—and to-morrow at four at the lawyer’s you
will receive the sum of thirty one thousand three hundred
and eighteen francs and a few centimes. Ahem. My dear
Caroline, you are old enough to know what you are about.
Still you are not one of those undutiful children who
throw aside all obedience to their fathers as soon as they
are of age. You continue, I am sure, to recognize my
right at least to give you advice. I have lived longer than
you, I am a man of business, and I can clearly be of use to
you when you want to invest your money. Have you any
plans as to this so far?

CAROLINE. I had some idea—

DUPONT. May I know what it is?

CAROLINE. I would rather not say.

DUPONT. Not say!

CAROLINE. Yes.

DUPONT. Indeed. Oh, in that case—[shrug]

CAROLINE. You don’t mind, father?

DUPONT [much put out, but endeavoring to control himself]
Not at all. By no means. Then there’s nothing
more to be said. I am a little surprised, of course; hurt
even; greatly hurt, in fact.

CAROLINE. I am sorry, father.

DUPONT. No matter. No matter.

135

CAROLINE. You understand—

DUPONT. I understand that you do not trust your father.
That is what I understand. But have your own way. I
ask nothing.

CAROLINE. Are you vexed with me?

DUPONT. Oh no. Not the least in the world. Only when
you have given everything you possess to some religious
community or other, I should like to know what you will
have to live upon when you are old. I assume, of course,
that it is some community you are thinking of. [Caroline
is silent]. You admit it?

CAROLINE. No. I would rather say nothing about it.

DUPONT. It is so, all the same?

CAROLINE. Please, father!

DUPONT. You won’t give me any idea?

CAROLINE. No.

DUPONT. You refuse, then? You refuse absolutely?

CAROLINE. I have the right to do so, have I not?

DUPONT. Clearly. You are old enough.

CAROLINE. Don’t let us talk about it any more.

DUPONT. Very well. [After a moment, breaking into a
passion] So this is my reward! This is the result of having
sacrificed my whole life for my daughters. You do not even
trust me as much as you would trust any little attorney
you consulted.

CAROLINE. Father! Of course I trust you.

DUPONT [furiously] Hold your tongue. You are heartless
and undutiful. I did not expect this.

CAROLINE. Please don’t be angry, father.

DUPONT. Angry? Yes; I am angry, and I have good
reason. [Striking the table] Damnation! This is too much!
To have lived to be sixtytwo and be insulted like this. [He
strides up and down the room].

CAROLINE. I thought I could—I have only disposed of
part of the money.

DUPONT [stopping short] What?

CAROLINE. I have only disposed of part of the money.

136

DUPONT [mollified, becoming tenderly reproachful and
coming to sit by her] My dear child, why didn’t you say
so at once?

CAROLINE. You gave me no time.

DUPONT. How much is gone?

CAROLINE. Fifteen thousand francs.

DUPONT. Um. That is a large sum. But the sixteen
thousand that remain?

CAROLINE. I meant to ask your advice about that.

DUPONT [rising] Ah, well, my dear, I have been thinking
this over. Let’s consider what openings there are for
capital. Suppose you invest it? Gilt edged securities bring
in two and a half per cent. If you take something rather
more speculative, you may get four. Then there are the
big industrial companies. But with them, too, there are
risks to be faced. Foreign competition is more and more
threatening. The struggles between labor and capital are
reaching an acute phase.

CAROLINE. M. Antonin Mairaut has been to see me.

DUPONT. The scoundrel! I’ll bet he wanted you to invest
the money in his bank.

CAROLINE. He did suggest it.

DUPONT. You see. I guessed as much. You sent him
about his business, I hope?

CAROLINE. I said I would think about it.

DUPONT. That’s right. But what a fright you gave me.
To invest your money in a bank. Nothing could be more
risky. Well, as we were saying. No public companies, no
industrials, no shares in banks. What remains?

CAROLINE. I don’t know.

DUPONT. There remains commercial enterprize, trade.
But do you know anyone engaged in trade who will let
you put capital into his business?

CAROLINE. I think not.

DUPONT. We must put our heads together. I confess I
can think of no one. Madame Grandjean?

CAROLINE. Father! Madame Grandjean is divorced.137
You know quite well I refused even to accept employment
from her.

DUPONT. That is true. More fool you, by the way.
Still—M. Darbout?

CAROLINE. He is a Protestant.

DUPONT. Well, then, I don’t see. There is no one, in
fact.

CAROLINE. But you, father. If you would do it.

DUPONT. If I would do what? Manage it for you?

CAROLINE. Yes.

DUPONT. It is a great responsibility. I don’t know
whether—What interest would you expect?

CAROLINE. Whatever you thought right, father.

DUPONT. Well, I will speak to your mother about it.
[As if suddenly making up his mind] No: I won’t. I’ll do
it. No one shall say I hesitated to do all I could for my
daughter. Kiss me, my dear. I’ll do it.

CAROLINE. Thank you, father.

DUPONT. And you would still rather not tell me what
you are doing with the other fifteen thousand.

CAROLINE. Please, father.

DUPONT. Very well. You are your own mistress. I’ll
have the necessary documents prepared. Don’t you worry
about it. I will arrange everything beforehand. You will
have nothing to do but sign. [He looks at his watch] Three
o’clock. Now there is that other matter we have to talk
of. [He goes to the door and calls] Come in, both of you.
[Julie and Madame Dupont enter]. Sit down. [When they
are all seated, he says] My dears, I wanted you all to come
here that we may decide how we are to receive Angèle.
It is rather a difficult question. You know her life in Paris
is—ahem—highly reprehensible. Ought we to let her
come here? Ought we to meet her, for instance, at the
station?

JULIE. Papa, what has Angèle done? Now that I am
married surely I may know? People always stop talking
about her when I come in. I remember her quite well.

138

MME. DUPONT. But you were only five when she went
away.

DUPONT. You understand, my children, how painful
this subject is both for you and for me. I will spare you
the details as far as possible. It is enough that you should
know, Julie, that when Angèle was seventeen she was
obliged to leave her home because—because—

MME. DUPONT [simply] Because she was about to become
a mother.

JULIE. She went away?

DUPONT. Yes.

JULIE. Of her own free will?

DUPONT. I sent her away.

JULIE. Ah!

DUPONT. As I said, the subject is a very painful one.
Let us get it over as quickly as possible. She is coming
here to-day. [He looks at his watch] She is on her way
now. Her train arrived five minutes ago. Now I hope
you will all of you behave with dignity, and neither be
too affectionate, which would be out of the question, nor
too cold, which would be unkind.

JULIE. Have you heard anything of her since she left
home?

DUPONT. Yes.

JULIE. And her behavior?

DUPONT. Far from what it should be, I’m afraid. Still—

CAROLINE. Father, you make too light of all this. We
have heard of her three times. First when her baby died.
Next we were told that she was singing at a music hall
and was almost penniless. The third time we heard that
she was rich, rich without working. When I think of it
all I am sorry I consented to meet her.

JULIE. But she couldn’t get her share of the legacy unless
you did. You couldn’t rob her of this money however
you feel towards her.

CAROLINE. That was what decided me. But there is no
reason why I should see her here.

139

DUPONT. I shall see her. Julie will see her. So will your
mother. Why should you do differently from us?

MME. DUPONT. She was very fond of you, Caroline; and
you were fond of her. Come, come, you must not be so
hard. One should have compassion for those who have
suffered as she has done.

CAROLINE [after a pause] Very well. I will do as you
wish.

DUPONT. That’s right. At the same time, I have no intention
of going from one extreme to the other. There
will be no question of asking her to stay, or even of inviting
her to dinner. That is agreed, is it not?

CAROLINE. Yes. And now I am going downstairs to the
office. [She goes out].

DUPONT. You, Julie, had better go to your room. [She
goes]. In ten minutes she will be here.

MME. DUPONT. Well, I must say if she were my daughter,
I should have been at the station long ago.

DUPONT. Do you suppose I haven’t wanted to go?

MME. DUPONT. Why didn’t you, then?

DUPONT. What would people say? Everyone knows
me here. On the platform I should have met a dozen
people who would have asked me whom I was meeting.
And, besides, all things considered, it looks more dignified
to receive her here. [Pondering] I’ve been asking myself
for the last fortnight what I should say when we do meet.

MME. DUPONT. Give her a kiss. The rest will come
easily.

DUPONT. You think I should kiss her?

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

DUPONT. I think so, too. At the same time we must remember—how
shall I put it? Her way of life. It is a difficult
question. And then what am I to say to her? Ought
I to refer to the past? I must not seem to be forgiving
her, of course. I couldn’t do that. I couldn’t possibly. On
the other hand, since she is coming, I can hardly—Confound
it, it’s all extremely awkward. Eh?

140

MME. DUPONT. I can’t advise you.

DUPONT [still thinking it out] Of course, she is my
daughter. Still, I have not seen her for eighteen years.
[Peevishly] I thought I should never set eyes on her
again. In the early days, when she first went away, I was
terribly distressed. But that couldn’t last, could it? And
then, you understand—Well, well, you must advise me. I
have prepared something to say, so as not to leave everything
to the inspiration of the moment. If one doesn’t
think things out beforehand, one always says too much or
too little. So, as I said, I have prepared something. I even
wrote it out, but I know it by heart. You can imagine
how upset I am with all this. Here it is: ‘My child’—I
think it best to say ‘my child.’ ‘Angèle’ would be too
familiar and ‘my daughter’ too formal. ‘My child’—[breaking
off]. And what makes it all the harder is that
I’ve no idea what she will say to me. Her letters are very
properly expressed, very properly. Still, will she cry?
Will she break down? Will she faint? I don’t know. It’s
impossible to know. Dear me, I wish the next half hour
were over. However: ‘My child, I thank you for having
come.’ The fact is I ought to tell you I haven’t given
Caroline quite a true account of how things stood. I
thought it wiser not.

MME. DUPONT. What do you mean?

DUPONT. It’s this way. Caroline is the one who could
not get her legacy without Angèle’s signature. Not the
other way about.

MME. DUPONT. But you said—

DUPONT. Yes; I did misrepresent matters a little. You
see Caroline would never have agreed to meet Angèle if
she had known that it was she who needed Angèle’s presence,
not Angèle hers. Angèle is the executor under the
will. In fact, it is she who is doing us a service. But if we
go into all that we shall never be done. Well, I say to her:
’My child, I thank you for having come. Let us not speak
of the past. I only wish to remember one thing, that you141
have not visited upon your sister Caroline the resentment
which doubtless I inspire in you. I am grateful to you.’
What do you think of that? [The maid comes in]. Good
heavens, here she is! [Pointing to the papers, account
books, etc., which lie on the table] And that fool Courthezon
has never taken away the books. [To the maid] Wait
a minute. [To Madame Dupont] Come, come this way.
You can tell me whether I ought to make any change.
[In a low voice to the maid] Ask her to wait a moment.
Say I am engaged. [He goes out with Madame Dupont.
The maid shows in Angèle. She is a woman of thirtyfive,
dressed in black, very quietly, but fashionably].

MAID. Monsieur is engaged, but I don’t think he will be
long. Whom shall I say, madame?

ANGÈLE. Madame Angèle Dupont.

MAID. Madame has the same name as monsieur?

ANGÈLE. The same.

MAID. Will madame please be seated? [She takes some
books off a chair and goes out].

ANGÈLE [with a gesture of despondency, to herself] Nothing
is as it used to be. Nothing.

Courthezon comes in.

COURTHEZON. M. Dupont asks you to be good enough
to wait five minutes, madame.

ANGÈLE. Certainly, monsieur. [Courthezon collects the
books and papers, looking at Angèle the while out of the corner
of his eye. He makes as if to go]. You are M. Courthezon,
are you not?

COURTHEZON [much embarrassed] Yes, madame—Mlle.
Angèle. You remember me? You have a good
memory. Especially as I am not quite myself just now. I
have many things to worry me. But that is a long story.
[He stands facing her, the books and papers under his
arm]. I recognized you at once. M. Dupont told me.

ANGÈLE. My father is well in health?

COURTHEZON [embarrassed] Quite well. They are all
quite well. You, too, if I may judge by your looks?

142

ANGÈLE. Quite. Thank you.

COURTHEZON. And you have come about this legacy?

ANGÈLE. Yes. [A silence].

COURTHEZON. You must find some changes down here?

ANGÈLE. Very many. I hardly know the place.

COURTHEZON. We have moved since you went away.
The house where the press used to be was pulled down
when the Rue de l’Arbre-à-Poires was rebuilt.

ANGÈLE [looking round her] They have altered the furniture
in the drawing room.

COURTHEZON. That was ten years ago.

ANGÈLE [sadly] If I had come here without warning, I
shouldn’t have known I was in my father’s house.

COURTHEZON. It is so long since you left. You must feel
it very much, the idea that you are to see him again?

ANGÈLE [very slowly] Yes. But less than I expected.
When I got my father’s letter, I felt as if I should faint.
That was two months ago. Since then I have thought of
this moment every day. I have wondered so often what
my father would say to me and what I should answer that
now I no longer feel anything. That is strange, is it not?
Strange and sad. [She sighs]. After all, M. Courthezon,
life is always more commonplace than we expect; simpler,
but less beautiful. [A pause. Sadly] And besides, I have
seen so much.

COURTHEZON. You have suffered, too?

ANGÈLE. A little.

COURTHEZON. Eighteen years, is it not?

ANGÈLE. Yes. Eighteen years.

COURTHEZON. I hear M. Dupont. I must be going. Au
revoir, madame.

Courthezon goes out. A moment later the voice of Dupont
is heard without through the half open door, saying:
’Yes, yes; I want you to come with me.’ Then M. and Madame
Dupont come in. There is a long pause, and finally
Dupont says, with apparent calm

DUPONT. Good morning Angèle.

143

ANGÈLE. Good morning, father.

They hesitate for a moment as to whether they should
kiss one another, then make up their minds to do so. Dupont
places a chill salute on either cheek of Angèle. Still
silent, Angèle goes up to Madame Dupont and kisses her
with the same frigidity.

MME. DUPONT. Good morning, Angèle.

ANGÈLE. Good morning, mother. [They look at one
another without a word].

DUPONT [overcoming a momentary emotion] Let us sit
down. [They sit. Then he addresses Angèle in the tone he
might have used if she had only gone away the previous
evening] Thank you for coming.

ANGÈLE. I came for my sister’s sake. For Caroline. I
was very fond of her. [A pause]. Is she married?

DUPONT. No. She has never wished to marry.

ANGÈLE. Yet she is thirty-three.

DUPONT [to his wife] Thirty-three or thirtyfour?

MME. DUPONT. Thirty-three.

ANGÈLE. I shall see her?

DUPONT. Yes. We will let her know you are here.

ANGÈLE. And my half-sister?

DUPONT. Julie?

ANGÈLE. Yes; Julie.

DUPONT. Your half-sister is married. She has made a
good match. The son of a banker. The Mairauts. You
remember M. Mairaut, the grandfather?

ANGÈLE. No.

DUPONT. Oh, yes; an old man with a long white beard.

ANGÈLE. No.

DUPONT. Anyhow, he was the grandfather of M. Antonin
Mairaut, Julie’s husband. [He points to the door]
She is in there.

ANGÈLE. There?

DUPONT [speaking rapidly to hide his mingled emotion
and embarrassment] Yes. She has come back with her
husband to live with us for a time. Their house at St.144
Laurent is flooded. You remember the house at St. Laurent?

ANGÈLE. Yes.

DUPONT [as before, his embarrassment growing] I told
them they ought to build a little wall along the river bank
or their house would be flooded. They wouldn’t listen to
me and this is the consequence. Happily the water is going
down, and they’ll be able to go home to-morrow. But
they should have built a wall like their neighbors. Their
neighbors built a wall and—and that’s how it was.

ANGÈLE [after a pause] How is the business doing?
Well?

DUPONT. Oh, yes.

ANGÈLE. And you are all quite well?

DUPONT. All of us. I had a touch of bronchitis last year,
but it passed off.

ANGÈLE. I am glad. [A silence].

DUPONT [to Angèle, who is gazing at him] You find me
looking older, eh?

ANGÈLE. On the contrary. I was just thinking—

DUPONT. And you? You are well?

ANGÈLE. Quite, thank you. [Another silence. Then Angèle
rises and the Duponts rise too].

DUPONT. You can’t stay any longer?

ANGÈLE. No. I’m afraid I must—[Another silence].

DUPONT. You came straight from the station?

ANGÈLE. No. I had my things taken to the Lion d’Or.

DUPONT. You are staying at the Lion d’Or?

ANGÈLE. Yes.

DUPONT. Just so. Well, until to-morrow. Four o’clock
at the lawyer’s. His house is just opposite. [He points
through the window]. You can see his door from here.
You can’t miss it.

ANGÈLE. I understand. [A pause]. Julie—she is there?
[She points to the door].

DUPONT. Tut, tut, what am I thinking of? I had forgotten.
Yes; she is there. They will take you to her. [To145
Madame Dupont] Go and see if—I’ll tell someone to go
and find Caroline. [He rings].

MME. DUPONT [opening a door and calling through it]
Julie: your sister Angèle is here.

JULIE [from her room] Angèle? Ask her to come in.

MME. DUPONT. You can go in to her.

Angèle goes. Dupont has rung and says a few words to
the maid, who goes out at once.

DUPONT. Ouf! [To Madame Dupont] Ah well, it has
all gone off excellently. I didn’t say a word of what I had
got ready, but still it was all right. Don’t you think so?

MME. DUPONT. Quite. Poor girl! I felt sorry for her.

DUPONT. She is quite happy. She was very well dressed,
quite like a lady in fact. Who would think to see her—Eh?
[Madame Dupont nods]. And yet—But when one
has had a good education it always comes out. It is
curious. I thought I should be quite upset when I saw
her. Instead of which—Of course I don’t mean that I
didn’t feel it. Still it wasn’t so bad as I expected. But now
she’s no longer there I feel—I feel my legs giving way
under me! [He sits down. A silence]. If I were not so
sure it was my duty to do as I did—for it was my duty?
[Pause] You don’t answer. Wasn’t it my duty?

MME. DUPONT. I don’t know.

Caroline comes in.

DUPONT. Angèle—

CAROLINE. Yes. Courthezon told me.

DUPONT [with assumed carelessness after a pause] You
understand, Caroline, no reproaches. Don’t make any
allusion to what you are doing for her sake.

CAROLINE. I understand.

DUPONT [to his wife] Tell her that Caroline is waiting
for her.

The maid comes in.

MAID. M. and Madame Mairaut, monsieur. They wish
to speak to you.

DUPONT. Good. Where are they? In the office?

146

MAID. Yes, monsieur.

DUPONT [to his wife] I know what they want. [To the
maid] I will come down with you. [He and the maid go
out].

MME. DUPONT [speaking at the door of Julie’s room]
Caroline is here.

Angèle comes in and makes a quick movement towards
Caroline but pulls herself up before the coldness of the
other’s demeanor.

ANGÈLE. Caroline.

CAROLINE. Angèle. [They stand looking fixedly at one
another for some moments].

ANGÈLE [sadly] How changed you are!

CAROLINE. You are changed too.

ANGÈLE. That is because life has not always gone
smoothly with me. [Caroline makes a gesture of incredulity].
You don’t believe me?

CAROLINE. Yes, if you say so.

ANGÈLE. I have just seen Julie. She was kinder than
you are. And she was only five when I left home and she
is only my half-sister. You and I have the same father
and the same mother. We are almost of an age and we
used to love one another.

CAROLINE [coldly] That is true.

ANGÈLE. If you knew all about it you would forgive me.

CAROLINE. Are the things that were said about you
untrue?

ANGÈLE. No. However bad they were they are true.

CAROLINE. Since that is so—

ANGÈLE [without anger] Since that is so—I still think
your virtue very proud and very hard. That is all.
[Changing her tone] You understand what has brought
me here?

CAROLINE. I understand that we are to meet at the
lawyer’s.

ANGÈLE. Very well. To-morrow at four.

CAROLINE. To-morrow at four at the lawyer’s.

147

ANGÈLE [turning at the door, greatly moved] You have
nothing else to say to me?

Caroline shakes her head. Angèle goes out. A moment
after Dupont comes in.

DUPONT [beaming] She has gone?

CAROLINE. Yes.

DUPONT [chuckling] Where is your mother? Where
is she? [He calls Madame Dupont].

MME. DUPONT. What is it?

DUPONT. I want you.

CAROLINE. I will go.

DUPONT. There’s no need.

CAROLINE. I have some work to do.

DUPONT. Very well. Go, my child. Go. [Calling after
her] To-morrow, remember. [She goes out as M. Dupont
rubs his hands, chuckling] Guess what M. and Madame
Mairaut came to ask me. You can’t guess?

MME. DUPONT. No.

DUPONT. No wonder. They came to ask for the twentyfive
thousand francs, the twentyfive thousand francs of
Julie’s dot, you remember, which I was to pay six months
after her marriage.

MME. DUPONT. Well?

DUPONT. Well. It is six months to-day since Julie was
married.

MME. DUPONT. Good heavens! What did you do?

DUPONT. Gave them nothing, of course.

MME. DUPONT. You couldn’t do otherwise.

DUPONT. As you say, I couldn’t.

MME. DUPONT. But they will make us bankrupt.

DUPONT [still smiling broadly] They can’t. They have
nothing but my word.

MME. DUPONT. Luckily.

DUPONT. However, I haven’t refused the twentyfive
thousand francs. Nor have I disputed the debt.

MME. DUPONT. What did you do then?

DUPONT. I wish you had been there. You would have148
laughed.

MME. DUPONT. Well?

DUPONT. I think I managed pretty well, though I say
it who shouldn’t. If you had seen the long faces they
pulled. Especially Mother Mairaut. [He bursts out
laughing]. I should have liked a photograph of them. It
would have cheered me in moments of depression. Ha!
Ha! Ha!

MME. DUPONT [smiling] Tell me about it.

DUPONT. Well—I’d have given anything for a photograph.
I said to them [solemnly] ‘Dear monsieur and
dear madame, I admit that I promised to pay you to-day
twentyfive thousand francs. Only I am not in a position
to pay them.’ Explosion! Rage! Dignified reproaches!
Insults! Smiling, I let the storm to pass
by. Mother Mairaut sat there, her husband here, I here.
All the time they were speaking I looked at them
like this [grins]. As soon as they had finished I took
up the tale again. ‘I do not deny the debt,’ said I,
’only I ask to be allowed to postpone the payment.
And this time I am ready to sign an undertaking, a
binding undertaking, to pay.’ Complete change of
front! Smiles. Apologies. Oh, they were devilish civil.
Called me a man of honor, etc., etc. I let them run on,
still smiling. Then, in the midst of an almost religious
silence, I sat down at my desk, I took pen and paper, I
wrote, I blotted, so, taking my time about it. Madame
Mairaut positively slobbered with delight. I tell you she
slobbered. I handed her the paper. On it was written
simply: ‘Good for the sum of twentyfive thousand francs
to be paid out of the money to be left by Uncle Maréchal.’
Ha! Ha! Ha!

MME. DUPONT [laughing] Splendid!

DUPONT. Funny, eh? Deuced funny!

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

DUPONT. You don’t think so? You don’t! Eh? Wasn’t
it funny?

149

MME. DUPONT. Yes. Yes.

DUPONT. When Mother Mairaut took it in I thought
she was going to have a fit. ‘It’s an insult!’ she shrieked.
I believe she actually even called me a cad! As for me, I
was almost dying with laughter. They went away swearing
they were going straight to the bank to tell Antonin.
By Jove I haven’t enjoyed myself so much for ever so long.

MME. DUPONT [becoming serious again] I hope this
won’t make any difference to Julie.

DUPONT. Bah!

MME. DUPONT. Things are not going very well with her,
I’m afraid. Antonin is exacting and tyrannical, and she
often locks herself into her room to cry.

DUPONT. That always happens in the early days of
marriage. People’s angles need rubbing off. That sort of
marriage turns out best in the end. [Julie comes in]
Here she is. Speak to her. Tell her these things aren’t
serious. Make her understand her duty. I must go back
to my accounts. [To Julie] Well? What did your sister
Angèle say to you?

JULIE. Hardly anything. She didn’t know me, and I
shouldn’t have known her.

DUPONT. I told you so. Well, I must be off. Back soon.
[He goes out].

MME. DUPONT. My dear—your husband may be rather
put out when he comes in.

JULIE. I am getting used to that.

MME. DUPONT. More so than usual, I mean.

JULIE. Why?

MME. DUPONT. Your father has been unable to keep his
promise.

JULIE. About the twentyfive thousand francs?

MME. DUPONT. Yes. Antonin will have just heard about
it.

JULIE [depressed] No matter. [Suddenly, alarmed]
I do believe I forgot to tell them to get out his grey suit.
No: I remember. I did tell them. How angry he would150
have been if I hadn’t!

MME. DUPONT. Of course. He is your husband.

JULIE. You think it quite natural that he should fly
into a rage as he did two days ago because something or
other had been forgotten? And that it is only reasonable
he should order me to go to Mass merely that Madame
So-and-so may see me there! Well, he may order as
much as he likes. I shall not go. I will not go!

MME. DUPONT. You make too much of it. My child,
aren’t you happy?

JULIE [ironically] Of course.

MME. DUPONT. Your husband is fond of you, isn’t he?

JULIE. That depends on what you mean by fond.

MME. DUPONT. I mean he’s very much in love with you.

JULIE. I suppose so.

MME. DUPONT. You’re angry with him for that?

JULIE. No, I’m angry with myself.

MME. DUPONT. My dear! What do you mean?

JULIE. I am ashamed of myself.

MME. DUPONT. I don’t understand.

JULIE. Nor do I. Don’t let us talk about it.

MME. DUPONT. Please, dear.

JULIE [breaking out] Well, I detest him. There!

MME. DUPONT. Tell me why.

JULIE. There is no why in that sort of dislike. It is born
and grows with every moment we are together. Every
moment there comes some little point on which we clash.
We haven’t the same ideas on a single subject. He and I
are strangers. We are apart utterly, miserably. We are as
far from one another as two human beings can be. [With
a deep sigh] Oh, to realize that slowly, hopelessly. To feel
that every fresh glimpse into each other’s character only
reveals a fresh source of offence. Till at last it has come
to this, that I am certain the more we know each other
the deeper will be our mutual loathing. Every day, every
hour will add a fresh hatred to the accumulated hatreds of
the others. Great Heavens! And unless we are divorced151
this will go on all our lives. [A pause]. Why, there are
moments when he is sitting there in that chair, and I look
at him fixedly, and it seems as if I had never seen him before.
And why not? After all, it is only six months since
I hardly recognized him when we passed in the street.
And then I ask myself what am I doing here? I, in my
dressing-gown, with my hair down, shut in with that
man. And I long to run away screaming. And we are
husband and wife. Oh, mother, I am ashamed.

MME. DUPONT. You must try to be reasonable. Antonin
is a fine fellow. Many girls would have been glad to get
him.

JULIE. Why didn’t they then, in Heaven’s name? Oh,
if you knew how I long to have a child to console me for
all this. If I should never have one. If I should never have
one. [Shudders]. But I mustn’t even think of that.

MME. DUPONT. My dear child, you must look at things
more calmly. All this will gradually settle down until at
last it passes away altogether.

JULIE. Yes. When I am an old woman.

MME. DUPONT. Exactly, when you are an old woman.

JULIE. Thank you.

MME. DUPONT. In any case, you should try to control
yourself a little. If only for your father’s sake and mine.

JULIE. I will try. [Antonin comes in]. Hush. Here he
is. Go away, mother. You will only make things worse.
[Madame Dupont goes out].

ANTONIN [furious] Well! This is the last straw. Your
father won’t keep his word. You have heard?

JULIE [sitting on the sofa] Yes.

ANTONIN. It doesn’t disturb you apparently.

JULIE. He cannot do otherwise.

ANTONIN. It will be the ruin of me. But you seem to
be all in league together, the whole lot of you. Oh, you’re
a pretty family! Your father owes us twenty-five thousand
francs. He won’t pay them. The other day your sister
promised us fifteen thousand francs. To-day she has152
changed her mind. As for you, you do everything in
your power to compromise my position.

JULIE. I?

ANTONIN. You. You disobey me.

JULIE. In what?

ANTONIN. Were you at Mass this morning?

JULIE. No.

ANTONIN. Why not?

JULIE. It is not my fault if I no longer believe.

ANTONIN. I don’t ask you to believe. I ask you to go
to Mass. The two things are totally different. A woman
ought to go to Mass. If she doesn’t believe she should
appear to do so. It is usual among people of good position.
I wish you to do as others do. Do you understand?
I wish it. I have no desire to pass for a Freethinker when
all my clients are Catholics, confound them!

JULIE. I have not been and I do not intend to go.

ANTONIN. What do you say?

JULIE. You heard what I said. If you were a believer,
if you asked me to do this out of respect for your faith, I
would do it. But it is a piece of commercial trickery that
you want from me. I refuse.

ANTONIN. You wish to do as you like, you mean?

JULIE [breaking out] Yes. You are quite right. I wish
to do as I like. That is it. That is just it. For once in my
life I wish to do as I like! All the time I was a girl I had to
obey; to submit to authority that was often unreasonable.
Now I am to go on obeying, obeying. I have had
enough of this everlasting obedience.

ANTONIN. Then you shouldn’t have married.

JULIE. So that’s it, is it. The sole business of your
wife’s life is to be your slave, to help the servant to make
you comfortable, brush your clothes, taste your soup,
and look up to you with admiring homage.

ANTONIN. That’s all nonsense.

JULIE. What is nonsense?

ANTONIN. What you have been saying. You know153
quite well that you have other duties. You know quite
well that it only rests with you to be a happy wife. You
know that I love you.

JULIE. Yes, yes. I forgot. You love me! Which means
that I am to submit to your caresses when the fancy takes
you. They used to say of us women, ‘housekeeper or
mistress.’ But we have moved with the times. Now you
want the same woman to play both parts. Housekeeper
and mistress. That is the only difference between us and
the women you love before you marry us. A wife is a
mistress who minds the house. That is not enough for
me, thank you. No. No. No. I will not pass my whole
life between cooking your dinner and accepting your
kisses.

ANTONIN. That’s right. Off we go on the old story of
the wife who is not understood; the poor woman who is a
slave and a martyr. If you really love me, if you thought
a little more instead of cramming your head with ideas
which you don’t understand, you would be content with
the part, modest no doubt but not dishonorable, with
which plenty of women as good as you have contented
themselves.

JULIE. Perhaps you are right. If I loved you, as you say,
if we loved one another nothing would matter. But I say
again I do not love you.

ANTONIN. Be silent.

JULIE. I do not love you.

ANTONIN. Julie, I shall end by losing my temper. You
will force me to say things.

JULIE. To say things?

ANTONIN. Never mind.

JULIE. Oh, you may speak out. A little shame more or
less doesn’t matter. We are alone. Let us speak out and
clear up the matter once and for all. We must. It has been
weighing on my mind for a long time. Say what you have
to say.

ANTONIN. No.

154

JULIE. Then I will speak. I tell you that I do not love
you and you shrug your shoulders with a smile of self-complacency.
But it’s no laughing matter, Heaven
knows; and I don’t imagine I am the only woman for
whom this subject, amusing enough for you men, has
meant a whole tragedy of sorrow and disgust.

ANTONIN. I don’t understand you.

JULIE. Yes, you do!! Your vanity makes you try to escape,
but you shall understand. You think I daren’t speak, but
I will. Do you suppose I will stay dumb and bear the kisses
you give me, kisses which I end by returning. My lips
when you kiss them draw back in repulsion and yet in
the end they yield and go out to meet yours. Shall I go
on? [A pause. She looks him full in the face]. No. You
understand now. You can never again imagine the tears
I shed are tears of love. They are tears of remorse and
misery. I hate you after your kisses. Our love is a duel in
which I am worsted because what is best in me turns
traitor. I blush at your victories because you could never
have gained them without the help of what is base in me,
without the baseness you know how to excite. It is not I
who yield. It is the animal in me. It is all that is vile. I
hate you for the crime of our loveless marriage, the
crime you force me to share. I admit you are not the only
guilty one, you are not the only one worthy of contempt.
But I have had enough of it. Enough of it. I will no
longer spend my days weeping over the shame of my
nights. Every evening I have said I will regain my freedom.
Till now I have not dared to say the words that
would release me. Now I have done it. I am free.

ANTONIN [shrugging his shoulders] You are nothing
of the sort.

JULIE. What do you mean?

ANTONIN. I mean that I have more common sense than
you. I mean that it is my duty to guard you from these
exaggerated fancies of yours. The bonds that join us are
not to be broken by a whim. You are my wife and my wife155
you will remain. A divorce is impossible. I have given
you no cause. You may leave me, of course, but you know
the life of the woman who lives apart from her husband,
a life without respect and without social position. No: you
will stay with me.

JULIE. And it is this prison that we call marriage. [A
pause]. And when I think that I looked forward with
longing to this: that I sighed for it: that all my girlhood
I was hoping for it, dreaming of it. When I think that at
this very moment there are girls kneeling by their bedsides,
young girls whose hearts are yearning for this.
[She begins to cry]. Ah, poor girls! Poor girls! If they
only knew. [She wipes her eyes, after a moment] Just
Heaven, what a fool I am. Here am I crying when I should
be laughing. The thing is ludicrous. Why, if one dared,
one would shake with laughter at it all. You may be tyrants,
all of you, but you are so absurd that, when one
thinks, one can scarcely hate you for it. What you have
made of marriage! From start to finish: from the wedding
morning, with its monkey tricks, its vanity, and its folly.
When I think that there are still people who respect such
mummery! [She bursts out laughing].

ANTONIN. Julie. Don’t laugh like that.

JULIE. Oh, my dear sir, leave me alone. It’s well for
you I take it laughing. If I took it seriously, what sort of
figure would you cut? Everything about a wedding is
absurd, just because it is so detestable. Yes; everything.
From the moment when you set it before us as a duty to
hand ourselves over to our lords on such and such a day,
at such and such an hour, at a date and a minute fixed
beforehand. How is it that brides do not die of shame
under the curious eyes of the wedding guests and the
thoughts they hide? To think that they are passing the
day among people who know. Pah! Oh, yes; I am
quite aware how ridiculous the bride looks. [She puts
her hand familiarly on his shoulder]. But don’t imagine
the bridegroom cuts a very brilliant figure. [She laughs].156
You all wear a look of stupid complacency, like a contented
animal sure of its prey. And there must be a dot,
and you must be bought, and a price must be paid you in
order that you may marry us. Oh, yes. You have arranged
things finely among you; with your Deputies’
scarves and your music and incense. And you need them.
But do you think they impose on anyone nowadays? No.

ANTONIN. You make out too good a case for yourself.
And it’s not fair to make me responsible. All this is as
much the result of your acts as of mine.

JULIE. Indeed! I am curious to hear what those acts
are.

ANTONIN. I’ll tell you.

JULIE. Have I ever failed in my duty? Haven’t I been—

ANTONIN [sternly] Be silent. I’m going to have my say.
It’s no good your trying to play the injured victim. You
did exactly the same as I did. When I proposed for you,
I was not in love with you. I admit it. I didn’t love you
as you want to be loved. Yet you accepted me.

JULIE. Do you suppose I knew? What did I understand
about life? How could I have guessed—

ANTONIN. You knew perfectly well the sort of love I
felt for you, a sort of love every mother tries to rouse in
any young man she wants to catch for her daughter. And
the daughters take a hand in the game, too, bless their
little hearts!

JULIE. Do you mean to say I did such a thing?

ANTONIN. Yes: I do. You began this plain speaking:
I’m going on with it. You wanted the cards on the table
and you shall have them. Let us both own up. We know
now what marriage is, our own and everybody else’s.
We know all the tricks, all the humbug of it. Let’s look
it in the face. Your parents deceived mine.

JULIE. And yours?

ANTONIN. They did the same. I’m not denying it. But
did you help them? Yes or no?

JULIE. No.

157

ANTONIN. Yes: you did. I remember well enough how
you helped them to cajole me, trap me, dupe me. Oh I
know it sounds ridiculous. I know each petty incident
taken by itself amounts to nothing. But these deceptions
of yours have their importance, for you only made use of
them to catch me. You played on my weaknesses. You
knew I was fond of money—we’re talking straight to
each other, remember—you knew I was fond of money
and you represented yourself as a model young woman
who always made her own dresses. You remember that?
And Wagner! Wagner, whose music you professed to
admire so much, when you knew as little about him as I
do. According to your own account lots of men had
wanted to marry you. That was a lie. You had helped
your father in keeping his books and were interested in
my banking business. That was a lie, too.

JULIE. If that is all you have to reproach me with—

ANTONIN. It is not all. There was another lie to which
you condescended. And that was a serious one, because
you sacrificed your womanly dignity to your interest.
You have forgotten it? I have not. Why it was here,
here in this very room where we are at this moment, that
you sat dressed for a ball. You were not going to a ball.
I knew that later. But they told you to put on that dress,
and you know why. Well, that trick came off all right.
[Julie, confused, hides her face in her hands]. I behaved
as most men behave. I wanted to take your arm and kiss
it. You objected as any decent woman would. But when
you saw I was annoyed you said to yourself that a husband
was well worth the sacrifice of a little modesty, and you
came deliberately and let me kiss you as I wished. Isn’t it
true? Isn’t it? I tried to deceive you, I admit it. But if I
lied you lied, too. Marriages like ours may be shameful.
I don’t know. But don’t try to thrust the whole responsibility
on me when you’re equally guilty. [Julie’s head
sinks lower. A pause]. The other things you say about
me I dare say I deserve. I’m ambitious. I want to suc158ceed.
Is it my fault that success is the only road to social
consideration nowadays? In order to succeed I must
truckle to people who can be useful to me and I ask you
to help me. I’m not a hero. I’m like the rest of the world.
I didn’t make either myself or them. We are to be pitied,
both of us. But I’m more to be pitied than you are, for
you don’t love me and I can’t help loving you. What
shall I do if you leave me? My position will be compromised,
my business ruined. And more than all that I
shall have lost you. I don’t speak as I ought, I am a fool,
a dolt. I ought to have told you this at first instead of
going over all that wretched business. But it’s true, it’s
far worse for me than for you [much moved] for I love
you in spite of all you can say, and the idea of losing you
is like being told that I am going to die. [He sobs]. And
what have I done after all? I’ve only done as other men
do. Why should I be the only one to be punished? Ah,
Julie, my little Julie, pity me. I’m very unhappy. [He
weeps, bowed over the table, his head in his hands].

JULIE [putting her hand upon his head and speaking in
a low expressionless voice] Poor fellow.

ANTONIN [still weeping] You are sorry for me, aren’t
you. Say you are.

JULIE. Yes, we are both of us victims.

ANTONIN. That’s it. Ever since I was born my parents
have taught me that the great thing in life was to be rich.

JULIE [nodding sadly] Mine too.

ANTONIN. Unless one gets on nobody thinks anything
of one.

JULIE. And marriage is one of the ways of getting on.

ANTONIN. That’s what ruined us.

JULIE. Yes. It has ruined our lives as it has ruined so
many others.

ANTONIN [recovering his composure] You understand,
then? You do understand, don’t you?

JULIE [dully] Yes.

ANTONIN [taking her hand, which she does not draw159
away] You’re not angry? [Julie says nothing]. It is all
over, isn’t it? [patting her hand] All quite over and done
with. [She is still silent]. You see that I mustn’t do anything
that might damage the business? You see that?

JULIE. Yes.

ANTONIN. And that it’s better not to offend people who
may be useful to us. Isn’t it?

JULIE. Yes.

ANTONIN. After all, why shouldn’t one go to Mass?
Come, come. [He smiles]. We have been silly, haven’t
we, to say all that. It’s forgotten now, isn’t it? Say it’s
forgotten.

JULIE [reluctantly] Yes.

ANTONIN [recovering his spirits] That’s a good little
woman. There, there. One disputes, one flies into a passion,
one runs on and on, one says terrible things [laughing].
What things you said to me. Oh, it was shocking.
But there, we’ll never speak of it again. Never. Never.
Let’s make it up. [He takes her in his arms: hesitating,
she lets him do so]. We’re friends again, eh? And now go
and wash your face, or people will see you’ve been crying.
Are my eyes red, too? No, I expect not. Shall I tell
you something? You won’t believe it. You’ll be shocked.
Do you know, I almost think perhaps it’s as well we’ve
said all these things to each other. You see, now we
know each other better. You understand about some of
my worries. The business isn’t going as I should wish.
That makes my temper rather quick at times. No: things
might be better. If you would say a word to Caroline,
perhaps she would change her mind about that money.

JULIE [still on her guard] I will try.

ANTONIN. That’s a good girl. And it’s only for a little
while that we shall have to be careful. We are only two
and we shall pull through it. Luckily we’ve only ourselves
to think of. Imagine what it would be if we were
expecting a baby!

JULIE. That would give me courage.

160

ANTONIN. Nonsense, my dear. We can do very well
without that.

JULIE [alarmed] But we are going to have children,
aren’t we?

ANTONIN [after a moment’s hesitation, firmly] No.

JULIE. Why not?

ANTONIN. How absurd you are. Because I don’t choose,
of course.

JULIE. But we’ve often talked of having children.
You’ve made plans with me about what we should do
with them.

ANTONIN [laughing] I know. You liked it, and it was
something to talk about. But for the future we’re to be
perfectly straight with one another.

JULIE. Do you mean that we are never to have any
children?

ANTONIN [nods] We can’t afford them, my dear, at
present. And if we wait till we’re forty [shrugs], people
would laugh.

JULIE. Don’t you know what it was that made me willing
to marry? Don’t you know that it was this thought
of having children, this and this alone, that decided me?
And you refuse me this. To be a wife, to be a mother, is
the natural end of life for me. And something will be
wanting and my life will be incomplete, and I shall not
have lived if my arms have never clasped a baby born of
my flesh; if I have never suckled it, cried over it, felt all
the cares and all the joys that mothers feel. And you
would rob me of this. Merely because you love money,
because you are self-seeking and ambitious. Great Heavens,
to think that you should have such power over my
life! People talk of tyranny; they make revolts against
Governments; there are women who clamor for a vote;
who demand that the marriage law should be the same
for women as for men; and they don’t understand that
it is marriage itself they should attack, that they should
attack with fury, since it allows such an infamy.

161

ANTONIN. For goodness sake don’t begin again. Remember,
we made it up.

JULIE. Made it up! Just God, what name is there vile
enough for me to fling in your face? Are you so utterly
base that you think now there can be any thought of reconciliation
between us? After what you have just told
me, do you suppose that I would submit to—Think
what it means. Think what the thing you men call love
means to women if it has neither affection nor children
for its justification.

ANTONIN. I won’t answer you. You don’t know what
you’re saying. You’re mad, and I shall treat you accordingly.
To begin with, go to your room and try to calm
yourself. Go. [He tries to take her by the arm].

JULIE [shrieking] Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!
[She pushes him violently away].

ANTONIN [furious] Look here, Julie; I’m not going
to stand this. I tell you to go to your room at once.

JULIE. Don’t touch me.

ANTONIN. I shall touch you if I please. Oh, you may
scream if you like. You’re my wife, and I’ve the right to
do as I choose with you.

JULIE. Take your hands off me. I hate you, I say. I
hate you.

ANTONIN. You hate me. I dare say. But if you suppose
that I’m a genteel husband out of a book, who lets his
wife lock her door against him, you’re vastly mistaken.
I’ve married you, I love you, and I intend to keep you.
Hate me, do you? Very well. Escape from me if you can.
[He takes her in his arms. There is a struggle. Furniture
is overturned. No word is spoken, but you can hear their
deep breathing. Suddenly Antonin cries out] Curse you,
you’ve bitten me!

JULIE. Yes. And I will kill you if you don’t let me go!

ANTONIN [transported with rage] We shall see which
of us is master.

JULIE. We shall see!

162

ANTONIN. We shall! [Antonin goes out in a violent
passion].

Julie, left alone, straightens her hair and dress mechanically,
muttering to herself inaudibly. Suddenly she falls
upon a couch, and then upon the ground, where she lies
sobbing in an agony of misery.

163

ACT IV

The same scene. M. and Madame Dupont are sitting
together.

DUPONT. She’s determined to leave him, then?

MME. DUPONT. Quite determined.

DUPONT. And he?

MME. DUPONT. After the scene I told you of he went
straight out of the house and he hasn’t come back since.

DUPONT. He didn’t sleep at home last night?

MME. DUPONT. No.

DUPONT [scornfully] He has gone back to ‘maman,’ no
doubt. [He goes to the window].

MME. DUPONT [after a pause] Why do you keep looking
out of that window?

DUPONT. I’m watching the lawyer’s opposite. Caroline
went in five minutes ago. I’m terribly afraid Angèle
won’t come. [To himself] Confound Caroline. Who the
Dickens can have got hold of that other fifteen thousand
francs? [Joyfully] There’s Angèle. Look. She’s going
in now. What did you say? Bless my soul, my daughters
give me worry enough. Yes: he has gone back to ‘maman.’
And you think this won’t blow over, eh?

MME. DUPONT. I’m certain it won’t. Julie will never
forgive him.

DUPONT [almost with triumph] That means a divorce
then, eh?

MME. DUPONT. Yes. A divorce.

164

DUPONT. Ah! And who was the clever one this time,
too, eh? Who was it?

MME. DUPONT. I don’t know.

DUPONT. Of course not. Well, I was.

MME. DUPONT. In what way?

DUPONT. You say she’ll ask for a divorce?

MME. DUPONT. Unless he does.

DUPONT. Very well, then. Whichever way it is her
money was settled on herself, and our good Antonin will
have to give back the thirty thousand francs and my
house. Thanks to me. Thanks to me. [He rubs his hands].

The maid comes in.

MAID. M. and Madame Mairaut.

DUPONT. Show them in. [The maid goes out. To his
wife] Don’t go.

M. and Madame Mairaut come in.

MME. MAIRAUT [turning to the door and speaking to her
husband, who hangs back] Are you coming in or are you
not?

MAIRAUT. I’m coming. [He closes the door].

Formal greetings are exchanged.

MME. MAIRAUT [sitting down] After what passed between
us yesterday—

DUPONT [with dangerous sweetness] About Uncle Maréchal’s
money?

MME. MAIRAUT [appearing not to have heard] After
what passed between us yesterday, I intended never to
set foot in this house again.

DUPONT [bowing] It rested entirely with you, madame.

MME. MAIRAUT. Since then, however, grave differences
have arisen between our children.

DUPONT. Very grave.

MME. MAIRAUT. You know, then?

DUPONT. Yes.

MME. MAIRAUT. We are come therefore, my husband
and I, in the name of our son, formally to request your
daughter, Madame Antonin Mairaut, to return to her165
husband’s roof.

DUPONT. His roof?

MME. MAIRAUT. To St. Laurent. My son awaits her
there.

DUPONT. He’ll have to wait some time. My daughter
will not return to her husband. You are welcome to bring
an officer of the Court to bear witness to the fact. It will
provide your son with a ground for his divorce.

MME. MAIRAUT [sweetly] There is no question of a divorce.

DUPONT [astonished] What? No question of a divorce?

MME. MAIRAUT. None, monsieur.

DUPONT. In spite of my daughter’s refusal—

MME. MAIRAUT. In spite of her refusal.

DUPONT. In spite of what she has said to her husband?

MME. MAIRAUT. In spite of that, too.

DUPONT. In spite of anything she may do in the future?

MME. MAIRAUT. In spite of anything she may do. There
is no question of a divorce and there never will be.

DUPONT. On your part, you mean?

MME. MAIRAUT. On yours also. We shall give you no
grounds. My son is waiting for his wife to return to him.
He is ready to receive her whenever she sees fit to present
herself.

DUPONT. Whatever she does?

MME. MAIRAUT. Whatever she does.

DUPONT. Even if—

MME. MAIRAUT. Even in that case. [Movement of Mairaut].
What is it, my dear?

MAIRAUT. Nothing.

DUPONT. The truth is you would rather risk your son’s
honor than give back the thirty thousand francs.

MME. MAIRAUT [still very sweetly] After all, thirty thousand
francs is a considerable sum. [Mairaut fidgets uneasily].

DUPONT. Yesterday, when he went away, your son uttered
certain threats.

166

MME. MAIRAUT [still sweetly] He has decided not to put
them into execution.

MME. DUPONT. You know, of course, that Julie will
never agree—

MME. MAIRAUT. I can’t help that.

MME. DUPONT. All their lives they will be chained to
one another. Young as they are, they must give up the
idea of having a home.

MME. MAIRAUT. Your daughter has only to return to
her duty. Antonin will receive her.

MAIRAUT [breaking out] No. I won’t have it. I have a
word to say on this.

MME. MAIRAUT. What’s the matter now? Pray speak if
you have anything to say.

MAIRAUT [loudly] What we are doing is an infamy.

MME. MAIRAUT. Hold your tongue.

MAIRAUT. I won’t.

MME. MAIRAUT. Hold your tongue, I tell you.

MAIRAUT. No. And don’t you try to shout me down.
Do you hear?

MME. MAIRAUT. What’s taken the man? I’ve never seen
him like this before.

MAIRAUT. I tell you this is infamous! Infamous! I’ve
thought so for a long time, ever since the day you wouldn’t
let me speak out about Uncle Maréchal. I said nothing
because I was afraid of you. For thirty years I have said
nothing. But now this is too much, and I say what I
think. It’s an infamy. Come what may, I will say it. Sit
down. I tell you it’s an infamy. Rogues have been meddling
with these children’s lives too long; it’s time for
honest men to take a hand in them. I’m going to do it.

MME. MAIRAUT. Pay no attention to him. He’s out of
his senses.

MAIRAUT. Be silent, you. M. and Madame Dupont, this
is what I have to say to you. An effort must be made to
reconcile Julie and Antonin. If this is impossible, I will
pay you back the thirty thousand francs.

167

MME. MAIRAUT [with a scream] Good Heavens, what is
he saying?

MAIRAUT. I will return the thirty thousand francs, and
you’ll see after that if my precious son won’t be the first
to talk of a divorce.

MME. MAIRAUT [to her husband] You shall pay for this
when we get home.

MAIRAUT. As you please. And now be off, and be quick
about it. [Madame Mairaut goes out]. Au revoir, M. and
Madame Dupont. Do what you can on your side, and I
will try and make Antonin come and beg his wife’s pardon.

DUPONT. Good evening, M. Mairaut.

MME. DUPONT. Count on me, M. Mairaut, and give me
your hand. You’re a good man.

MAIRAUT [as he goes] That’s all right. [He goes].

DUPONT. Are you really going to try?

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

DUPONT. But since old Mairaut is willing to give back
the money.

MME. DUPONT. I won’t make up my mind to a divorce
until I’m absolutely convinced there’s no other way.

DUPONT. But there is no other way. You said so yourself.

MME. DUPONT. Are you sure you aren’t thinking more
of your money than of the happiness of your child?

DUPONT. I! Well, I declare! Are you taking a leaf out
of old Mairaut’s book?

MME. DUPONT [gravely] Perhaps so.

Madame Mairaut returns.

MME. MAIRAUT. I have come back for two things. First,
to advise you not to count too much on my husband’s
promise. Next, to thank you for the fresh insult you have
put upon us.

DUPONT. What insult?

MME. MAIRAUT. You don’t know, I suppose, to whom
Mlle. Caroline has given half her legacy?

168

DUPONT. No. But I shall be glad to learn.

MME. MAIRAUT. To your clerk, Courthezon.

DUPONT. Courthezon? It’s a lie!

MME. DUPONT. Courthezon!

MME. MAIRAUT. She has just told me so herself.

Caroline comes in.


MME. DUPONT.Caroline, is it really to Courthezon that
you’ve given the fifteen thousand francs?

DUPONT.You have given fifteen thousand francs
to Courthezon!

MME.      MAIRAUT.Isn’t it to Courthezon that you have
given the fifteen thousand francs?


CAROLINE. Yes.

DUPONT. You are crazy!

MME. DUPONT. What possessed you to do that?

MME. MAIRAUT. For his invention! An invention not
worth twopence, Antonin says.

MME. DUPONT. You think more of strangers than your
own flesh and blood.

DUPONT. Just at the very time when my plant needed
renewing.

MME. MAIRAUT. And when her brother-in-law is on the
verge of bankruptcy. Yes, mademoiselle, yes! And this
money, which you give to a crack-brained inventor who
is nothing to you, might perhaps have saved your sister
from penury. That is all I have to say to you. Good bye.
[She goes].

DUPONT. Well! Perhaps now you’ll tell us why you
have done this?

MME. DUPONT. What has taken you? How did such an
idea come into your head?

DUPONT. Do you imagine his invention will make your
fortune?

CAROLINE. No.

DUPONT. Do you know anything at all about it?

CAROLINE. No.

169

MME. DUPONT. Did he ask you to lend him money?

CAROLINE. No.

DUPONT. Then you ought to be put in an asylum.
You’re out of your senses.

MME. DUPONT. I still can’t make out how you came to
have such an idea.

CAROLINE [beginning to cry] I was unhappy.

DUPONT. What! You give away fifteen thousand francs
to the first comer because you are unhappy!

CAROLINE. I hope he will be grateful for what I have
done for him, and that—

DUPONT. Well?

CAROLINE. I am no longer young, I know; but he is not
young either.

DUPONT. You think he will marry you!

CAROLINE. Yes.

DUPONT. Then you don’t know—

MME. DUPONT. Hush.

CAROLINE. I can’t go on living alone. I am too wretched.
For a long time I have thought—when I saw M.
Courthezon, so steady and careful and quiet—I thought
I could be happy with him. But I knew he would never
marry me without money, and there was only enough for
Julie. The time when I was most unhappy was when M.
Antonin was here. He used to talk to Julie. They took
no notice of me. They used to kiss one another. And
though I don’t think I’m jealous, it made me very wretched.
So when this legacy came, and I knew M. Courthezon
needed money for his invention, I thought I would give
him some.

MME. DUPONT. You should at least have given him some
idea of what you meant. It would have saved you from
disappointment, my poor child.

DUPONT. You should have spoken to me. I could have
told you why you had nothing to hope in that quarter.

CAROLINE. Nothing to hope? But why? Why?

DUPONT. Because for twenty years Courthezon has been170
living with a married woman. He does not speak of it, of
course, but they have two children.

CAROLINE [faintly] God have pity on me! [She almost
falls].

MME. DUPONT. Caroline! My child!

DUPONT. My child. Come, come. You must be reasonable.

MME. DUPONT. You mustn’t cry like that.

CAROLINE [sobbing] No.

DUPONT [to his wife] This is your fault. We should have
told her that Courthezon—But you always said no.

MME. DUPONT. One can’t tell things like that to a young
girl. And afterwards, when she was grown up, it didn’t
seem worth while. [To Caroline] Don’t cry any more,
dear.

CAROLINE [stifling her sobs by a great effort] I am not
crying any more.

DUPONT. There is only one thing to be done. We must
try and get the money back from Courthezon.

CAROLINE. No! No!

DUPONT. We shall see. [He hurries out].

CAROLINE. Stop him. Stop him, mother. Go at once.
Stop him, I beg of you.

MME. DUPONT. Very well, dear. [She follows her husband].

Caroline is left alone for a moment. Then Angèle comes
in.

ANGÈLE [very tenderly] Caroline, are you in trouble?

CAROLINE [in a low voice] Yes.

ANGÈLE. What about? Tell me.

CAROLINE [in an expressionless voice, but not angrily].
No. It is over now.

ANGÈLE. You won’t tell me?

CAROLINE [coldly] It would be useless.

ANGÈLE. Who knows? Come. I can see you have been
crying.

CAROLINE. Yes. We are very unfortunate, Julie and I.

171

ANGÈLE. Julie?

CAROLINE. She is leaving her husband.

ANGÈLE. Why?

CAROLINE. They cannot go on living together any
longer.

ANGÈLE. And you?

CAROLINE. I? [She makes a gesture of hopelessness].

Julie comes in.

JULIE. I was looking for you, Caroline. I am going
away sooner than I expected. They say my husband is
coming here. I do not wish ever to see him again. So I
am going.

CAROLINE. What will you do?

JULIE. I shall do as you do; hire a room somewhere
and get work.

CAROLINE. What kind of work?

JULIE. I don’t know. Anything I can get.

CAROLINE. Don’t do that, Julie. Don’t! [Deeply distressed]
If you only knew!

JULIE. What?

CAROLINE. The wretchedness of living alone.

JULIE. I’m not afraid. I shall work so hard that I shall
have no time for moping.

CAROLINE. You will work. [She sighs]. It isn’t easy for
a woman who is alone to earn her living.

JULIE. Nonsense.

CAROLINE. I know what I’m talking about. Sometimes
when I take my work to the shop they refuse it with an
insolent contempt they would never dare to show to a
man. It’s true. For I am doubly unprotected since I am
a woman and I need work.

JULIE. But in your own room, at least, you are free.

CAROLINE. Free! [With a mirthless laugh]. If that is
freedom, give me slavery.

JULIE. I shall have friends.

CAROLINE. Do you think so? The women will have
nothing to do with you because you’ll be a wife living172
apart from her husband, and because you will be dull.
And the men? What will people say if they visit you?

JULIE. Little I care what people will say.

CAROLINE. Still for your own sake you will have to send
them away.

JULIE. What do you advise, then? That I should remain
with my husband?

CAROLINE. Ah, Julie dear, you complain of not being
loved as you wish to be. What can I say to that, I whom
no man will ever take in his arms? I who feel myself a
thing apart, useless, absurd, incomplete. You don’t know
what a void that means for a woman: to have no one to
forgive, no one to devote herself to. And the world sneers
at women for remaining single. It makes their loneliness
a reproach. Look at me, hardly allowed to dispose of my
own property, black looks all round me because I have
dared to use my own money in my own way.

JULIE. Poor Caroline.

CAROLINE. Yes. You may well pity me. And if I told
you all. I turned to religion for consolation. For a while
it cheated my craving for love; but it couldn’t give me
peace, and it has only left me more bitter and more disillusioned.
For months I buoyed myself up on one last
hope. I was a fool. [Weeping] Ah, no one need tell me
how absurd it was. I know it well enough. I, at my age
and in these clothes, much like everyone else’s clothes,
only everything looks ridiculous on me. I to fall in love!
I must be crazy. Don’t laugh at me. I have suffered so
much. I knew he couldn’t love me, but I hoped he would
be grateful for what I—I only wanted his gratitude and
his pity, no more, I swear to you. And now it seems there
is some other woman. [A pause]. Oh, what good was it
to guard my good name as a miser guards his gold if this
is all? No, Julie; don’t spoil your life a second time. If
you cannot resign yourself to living with your husband,
at least don’t follow my example. Don’t try to live my
life. One of us is enough. Don’t try to earn your bread.173
It is too hard, and men have made it too humiliating.

JULIE. But, Caroline, if people see me accepting hardship
with courage, living alone deliberately, because I
choose, surely the dignity of my life will make them respect
me?

CAROLINE. No one will believe in the dignity of your
life.

JULIE. Then it is monstrous! That is all I can say.
Monstrous! And since to pay for bread to eat and clothes
to wear and a roof to cover me I must either give myself
to a husband I hate or to a lover whom, perhaps, I may
love, I choose the lover. If I must sell myself to someone,
I prefer to choose the buyer.

ANGÈLE. You are mad! Mad! Be reconciled to your
husband. That is the best thing you can do.

JULIE. So everybody says. Well, I tell you I will not.
I will not.

ANGÈLE. You would soon be glad enough to have your
married life back again, bad as it may be; or even Caroline’s
poverty.

JULIE [scornfully] You think so.

ANGÈLE [passionately] You don’t know what you are
saying. You don’t understand, Julie. You to talk like
that! You to wish—Oh, you don’t understand.

JULIE. You did it yourself.

ANGÈLE [with great emotion] Yes. I did it. But I would
strangle myself rather than begin it again. Julie, I entreat
you. What am I to say? How am I to stop you? I
can’t tell you and Caroline all the shame I have endured.
Oh, don’t make me do that.

JULIE. Well, you’re happy now, at least.

ANGÈLE. Happy! When I went off with Georges—they
told you, didn’t they? Well, his people got him away
from me. His mother was dying of grief. Yes: I know
that is not what you wish to hear, but I must tell you, that
you may understand how I came to fall as low as I did. I
was left alone with the child. I had to feed it, hadn’t I?174
You can understand that, at least. But how? Work? I
tried to get work. But they told me to wait. How was I
to wait? And then—my God! that I should have to tell
you all this—then I let myself go. [She sobs]. And afterwards—No:
I can’t speak of it. But you understand,
Julie. You can guess. You can imagine what my life was
when you see that even now I can’t bring myself to tell
you about it. [Mastering herself]. You think women—women
like me—are happy because you see us laugh. But
to laugh is our trade. We are paid for that. And I swear
to you often we would ask nothing better than just to sit
and cry. And you talk of choosing! You poor child. Do
you suppose we women choose? Oh, if you could but know
how one comes to loathe the whole world, to be wicked,
wicked! They despise us so. We have no friends, no pity,
no justice. We are robbed, exploited. I tell you all this
anyhow, just as it comes, but you understand, don’t you?
And once you start downhill you can’t stop. That is our
life, the life of women like me. That is the slough in which
I have struggled ten years. No, no, Julie! No, little sister.
I implore you don’t do as I did. It is too horrible, too abject,
too degraded.

JULIE. Poor Angèle.

ANGÈLE. You understand, don’t you?

JULIE. Yes.

ANGÈLE [rising] I must go. Good-bye. I dare not look
either of you in the face again now that you know everything,
now that I remember what I once was. I knew you
could never have anything more to do with me. But I
felt such a craving to be loved that I half fancied you, at
least, Caroline—I see I was wrong. Well, good-bye. 1 am
going away. Forgive me, both of you, for what I have
done. Goodbye. [She turns to the door].

CAROLINE. Angèle! [A pause. Angèle turns at the
door]. I pity you with all my heart. [Another pause].
May I kiss you? [Angèle throws herself into her arms].

ANGÈLE. Caroline! My kind, good Caroline!

175

The three sisters embrace with tears.

Dupont, Antonin, and Mairaut come in.

ANTONIN [pushed forward by his father. To Julie] My
dear wife, I have come to ask you to forgive me.

JULIE. It is I who ask you to forgive me. I was full of
romantic ideas. I thought marriage something quite different
from what it is. Now that I understand I will be
reasonable. One must make allowances. I will make some—to
myself.

DUPONT. That’s right.

ANTONIN. That’s right. You can’t imagine how glad I
am that you understand me at last. It seems to me it’s
only from today that our marriage really begins.

JULIE. Perhaps.

ANTONIN. To celebrate our reconciliation I will give a
grand dinner. I will invite the Pouchelets, the Rambourgs,
Lignol—

JULIE [sadly, and with meaning] Exactly—Lignol.

DUPONT. Ah, my children, everything comes right when
once you make up your mind to be like the rest of the
world.

JULIE [slowly] Yes: like the rest of the world. I dreamed
of something better. But it seems it was impossible.

Damaged Goods

[Les Avariés]

Translated by John Pollock


180

Before the play begins the manager appears upon the stage
and says:—


                        Ladies and gentlemen,


I beg leave to inform you, on behalf of the author and of
the management, that the object of this play is a study of
the disease of syphilis in its bearing on marriage.

It contains no scene to provoke scandal or arouse disgust,
nor is there in it any obscene word; and it may be
witnessed by everyone, unless we must believe that folly
and ignorance are necessary conditions of female virtue.

181

ACT I

The doctor’s consulting room. To the right a large
stained glass window representing a religious subject. In
front of this, on pedestals, bronzes and statues. Parallel to
it a large Louis XIV writing table littered with papers and
statuettes. Between the desk and the window the doctor’s
chair. On the other side an armchair nearly facing the footlights
and a stool. To the left the entrance door, which, when
opened, reveals a corridor lined with tapestries, statues,
and paintings. Beyond the door a large glass bookcase,
above which hang portraits of Wallace, Dupuytren, and
Ricord. Busts of celebrated physicians. A small table and
two chairs. At the back a small door. The room is sumptuously
furnished and literally encumbered with works of
art.

George Dupont, in great distress and ill at ease, enters
by the door at the back, takes his stick, gloves, and hat from
the stool, and sits down on the sofa before the writing table.
He is a big fellow of twentysix, with large, round eyes, and
simple, but not ludicrous appearance. A heavy sigh escapes
him. The doctor, a man of forty, with the ribbon of the Legion
of Honor in the buttonhole of his frock coat, follows and takes
his seat. He gives the impression of a man of strength and
intellect.

GEORGE. Well, doctor?

DOCTOR. Well! There is no doubt about your case.

GEORGE [wiping his forehead] No doubt—How do
you mean no doubt?

182

DOCTOR. I mean it in the bad sense. [He writes. George
turns pale, and stays silent for a moment in terror. He
sighs again]. Come, come, you must have thought as
much.

GEORGE. No, no.

DOCTOR. All the same!

GEORGE [utterly prostrated] Good God!

DOCTOR [stops writing and observes him] Don’t be
frightened. Out of every seven men you meet in the
street, or in society, or at the theatre, there is at least one
who is or has been in your condition. One in seven, fifteen
per cent.

GEORGE [quietly, as if to himself] Anyhow, I know what
to do.

DOCTOR. Certainly. Here is your prescription. You will
take it to the chemist’s and have it made up.

GEORGE [taking the prescription] No.

DOCTOR. Yes: you will do just what everyone else does.

GEORGE. Everyone else is not in my position. I know
what to do. [He raises his hand to his temple].

DOCTOR. Five times out of six the men who sit in that
chair before me do that, perfectly sincerely. Everyone
thinks himself more unfortunate than the rest. On second
thoughts, and after I have talked to them, they realize
that this disease is a companion with which one can live;
only, as in all households, domestic peace is to be had at
the price of mutual concessions. Come now, I repeat,
there is nothing in all this beyond the ordinary. It is simply
an accident that might happen to anybody. I assure
you it is far too common to merit the name ‘French disease.’
There is, in fact, none that is more universal. If
you wanted to find a motto for the creatures who make a
trade of selling their love, you could almost take the famous
lines, ‘There is your master.... It is, it was, or it
must be.’

GEORGE [putting the prescription in the outer pocket of
his coat] But I at least ought to have been spared.

183

DOCTOR. Why? Because you are a man of good position?
Because you are rich? Look round you. Look at
these works of art; five are copies of John of Bologna’s
Mercury, six of Pigallo’s, three are reproductions—in
wax, to be sure—of the lost Wounded Love by Paccini;
do you think that all these have been presented to me by
beggars?

GEORGE [groaning] I’m not a rake, doctor. My life
might be held up as an example to all young men. I
assure you, no one could possibly have been more prudent,
no one. See here; supposing I told you that in all my
life I have only had two mistresses, what would you say
to that?

DOCTOR. That one would have been enough to bring
you here.

GEORGE. No, doctor, not one of those two. No one in
the world has dreaded this so much as I have; no one has
ever taken such infinite precautions to avoid it. My first
mistress was the wife of my best friend. I chose her on
account of him; and him, not because I cared most for
him, but because I knew he was a man of the most rigid
morals, who watched his wife jealously and didn’t let her
go about forming imprudent connections. As for her, I
kept her in absolute terror of this disease. I told her that
almost all men were taken with it, so that she mightn’t
dream of being false to me. My friend died in my arms:
that was the only thing that could have separated me
from her. Then I took up with a young seamstress.

DOCTOR. None of your other friends had sufficiently
reassuring morals?

GEORGE. No. You know what morals are nowadays.

DOCTOR. Better than anyone.

GEORGE. Well, this was a decent girl with a family in
needy circumstances to support. Her grandmother was
an invalid, and there was an ailing father and three little
brothers. It was by my means that they all lived. They
used to call me Uncle Raoul—I was not so green as to184
give my real name, you see.

DOCTOR. Oh! Your Christian name, well—besides, it
is always safer.

GEORGE. Why, of course. I told her and I let the others
know that if she played me false I should leave her at once.
So then they all watched her for me. It became a regular
thing that I should spend Sunday with them, and in that
sort of way I was able to give her a lift up. Church-going
was a respectable kind of outing for her. I rented a pew
for them and her mother used to go with her to church;
they liked seeing their name engraved on the card. She
never left the house alone. Three months ago, when the
question of my marriage came up, I had to leave her.
They all cried over my going. I’m not inventing or exaggerating:
they all cried. You see, I’m not a bad sort.
People do regret me.

DOCTOR. You were very happy. Why did you want to
change?

GEORGE [surprised at the question] I wanted to settle
down. My father was a notary, and before his death he
expressed the wish that I should marry my cousin. It was
a good match; her dowry will help to get me a practice.
Besides, I simply adore her. She’s fond of me too. I had
everything one could want to make life happy. My acquaintances
all envied me. [Miserably] And then a lot
of idiots must give me a farewell dinner and make me gad
about with them. See what has come of it! I haven’t any
luck, I’ve never had any luck! I know fellows who lead
the most racketty lives: nothing happens to them, the
beasts! But I—for a wretched lark—What is there left for
a leper like me? My future is ruined, my whole life poisoned.
Well then, isn’t it better for me to clear out of it?
Anyway I shan’t suffer any more. You see now, no one
could be more wretched than I am. [Crying] No one,
doctor, I tell you, no one! [He buries his face in his handkerchief]
Oh, oh, oh!

DOCTOR [rising and going to him with a smile] You must185
be a man, and not cry like a child.

George [still in tears] If I had led a wild life and spent
my time in bars and going about with women, I should understand:
I should say I deserved it.

Doctor. No.

GEORGE. No?

Doctor. No. You would not say so: but it doesn’t matter.
Go on.

George. Yes, I know I should. I should say I deserved
it. But for nothing! nothing! I have cut myself off from
all pleasures. I have resisted attractions as you would the
devil. I wouldn’t go with my friends to places of amusement:
ladies I knew actually pointed me out to their boys
as an example. I stuck to my work: I forced myself to be
more regular in my habits. Why, my two friends helped
me to prepare for my law exams. I taught them to make
me cram, and it’s thanks to them that I got through. Oh,
I should have liked to come home at four o’clock in the
morning with my coat-collar turned up, smoking a cigar
lit in some ballet-girl’s rooms! I’ve longed as much as anyone
for the taste of rouged lips and the glitter of blacked
eyes and pale faces! I should have liked larks and jolly suppers
and champagne and the rustle of lace and all the rest
of it! I’ve sacrificed all that to my health, and see what I’ve
got for it. Ah, if I had known! If I had only known!
Then I should have let myself go; yes, altogether! That
would have been something to the good, anyway! When
I think of it! When I think of the beastliness, the frightful
horrors in store for me!

Doctor. What’s all that nonsense?

George. Yes, yes, I know—hair falling out, camomile
for a cocktail, and a bath chair for a motor car with a little
handle for the steering wheel and a fellow shoving behind
instead of the engine; and I shall go, Gug, gug, gug, gug!
[Crying] That’s what will be left of handsome Raoul—that’s
what they called me, handsome Raoul!

Doctor. My dear sir, kindly dry your eyes for the last186
time, blow your nose, put your handkerchief in your pocket,
and listen to me without blubbering.

George [doing so] Yes, doctor; but I warn you, you are
wasting your time.

Doctor. I assure you—

George. I know what you are going to tell me.

Doctor. In that case you have no business here. Be off
with you!

George. As I am here, I’ll listen, doctor. It’s awfully
good of you.

Doctor. If you have the will and the perseverance,
none of the things you are dreading will happen to you.

George. Of course. You are bound to tell me that.

Doctor. I tell you that there are a hundred thousand
men in Paris like you, sound and in good health, I give
you my word. Come now. Bath chairs! You don’t see
quite so many as that.

George [struck] Nor you do.

Doctor. Besides, those who are in them are not all there
for the reason you think. Come, come! You will not be
the victim of a catastrophe any more than the other hundred
thousand. The thing is serious: nothing more.

George. There, you see. It is a serious disease.

Doctor. Yes.

George. One of the most serious.

Doctor. Yes; but you have the good luck—

GEORGE. Good luck?

Doctor. Relatively, if you like; but you have the good
luck to have contracted just that one among serious diseases
which we have the most effective means of combating.

George. I know; remedies worse than the disease.

Doctor. You are mistaken.

George. You’re not going to tell me that it can be
cured?

Doctor. It can.

George. And that I am not condemned to—

187

Doctor. I give you my word on it.

George. You’re not—you’re not making some mistake?
I have been told—

Doctor [shrugging his shoulders] You have been told!
You have been told! No doubt you know all the ins and
outs of the law of property.

George. Yes, certainly; but I don’t see what connection—

Doctor. Instead of being taught that, it would have
been much better if you had been told the nature of the
disease from which you are suffering. Then, perhaps, you
would have been sufficiently afraid to avoid contracting it.

George. But this woman was so—well, who could have
thought such a thing of her? I didn’t take a woman off
the streets, you know. She lives in the Rue de Berne—not
exactly a low part of the town, is it?

Doctor. The part of the town has nothing to do with
it. This disease differs from many others; it has no preference
for the unfortunate.

George. But this woman lives almost straight. One of
my chums has a mistress who’s a married woman. Well,
it was a friend of hers. Her mother—she lives with her
mother—was abroad at the time. At first she wouldn’t
listen to me; then, finally, after I had spent a whole half-hour
persuading her I had to promise her a ring like one
of her friend’s before she would give way. She even made
me take off my boots before going upstairs so that the
porter mightn’t hear.

Doctor. Well; if you had been taught, you would have
known that these circumstances are no guarantee.

George. That’s true; we ought to be taught.

Doctor. Yes.

George. At the same time it’s not a subject that can
be broached in the papers.

Doctor. Why not?

George. I can speak of my own knowledge, for my
father used to own a small provincial paper. If we had188
ever printed that word, the circulation would have
dropped like a stone.

DOCTOR. Yet you publish novels about adultery.

GEORGE. Of course. That’s what the public wants.

DOCTOR. You are right; it is the public that needs to be
educated. A respectable man will take his wife and daughters
to a music-hall, where they hear things to make a
doctor blush. His modesty is only alarmed by serious
words.

GEORGE. And then, after all, what would one gain by
being posted up about this disease?

DOCTOR. If it were better understood it would be more
often avoided.

GEORGE. What one wants is some means of avoiding it
altogether.

DOCTOR. Oh! That is quite simple.

GEORGE. Tell me.

DOCTOR. It is no longer any concern of yours; but when
you have a son you will be able to tell him what to do.

GEORGE. What’s that?

DOCTOR. To love only one woman, to be her first lover,
and to love her so well that she will never be false to you.

GEORGE. That’s easy, isn’t it! And if my son does not
marry till he is twenty-eight, what then?

DOCTOR. Then, that he may run the least risk, you will
tell him to go to the licensed dealers—

GEORGE. With a guarantee from the government.

DOCTOR. And to choose them a little stale.

GEORGE. Why so?

DOCTOR. Because at a certain age they have all paid
their toll. The prettiest girl in the world can give all she
has, not what she has no longer. That is what you will tell
your sons.

GEORGE. But do you mean that I can have children?

DOCTOR. Certainly.

GEORGE. Healthy ones?

DOCTOR. Perfectly healthy. I repeat: if you take proper189
and reasonable care of yourself for the necessary length
of time, you have little to fear.

GEORGE. Is that certain?

DOCTOR. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred.

GEORGE. Then I shall be able to marry?

DOCTOR. You will be able to marry.

GEORGE. You’re not deceiving me, are you? You
wouldn’t give me false hopes? You wouldn’t—How soon
shall I be able to marry?

DOCTOR. In three or four years.

GEORGE. What, three or four years? Not before?

DOCTOR. Not before.

GEORGE. Why? Am I going to be ill all that time?
You said just now—

DOCTOR. The disease will no longer be dangerous to
you yourself, but you will be dangerous to others.

GEORGE. But, doctor, I am going to be married in a
month!

DOCTOR. Impossible.

GEORGE. I can’t help it. The contract is all ready; the
banns have been published. I have given my word.

DOCTOR. Here’s a pretty patient! A moment ago you
were feeling for your pistol: now you want to be married
in a month!

GEORGE. But I must!

DOCTOR. I forbid you.

GEORGE. You can’t mean that seriously. If this disease
is not what I imagined and if I can be cured, I shan’t commit
suicide. If I don’t kill myself, I must take up the
ordinary course of my life. I must fulfill my engagements:
I must be married.

DOCTOR. No.

GEORGE. If my engagement were broken off it would
be absolutely disastrous. You talk of it like that because
you don’t know. I didn’t want to get married. I have told
you—I had almost a second family; the children adored
me. It is my old aunt, who owns all the property, who190
has pushed on the match. Then my mother wants to see
me ‘settled’ as she says. The only thing in the world
she wants is to see her baby grandchildren, and she
wonders twenty times a day whether she will live long
enough. Since the question first came up she simply
hasn’t thought of anything else; it’s the dream of her
life. And then I tell you I have begun to adore Henriette.
If I draw back now my mother would die of grief and I
should be disinherited by my aunt. Even that isn’t all.
You don’t know my father-in-law’s character! He is a man
of regular high old principles; and he has a temper like
the devil. What’s more, he simply worships his daughter.
It would cost me dear, I can assure you. He would call me
to account—I don’t know what would happen. So there
are my mother’s health, my aunt’s fortune, my future,
my honor, perhaps my life, all at stake. Besides, I tell you
I have given my word.

DOCTOR. You must take it back.

GEORGE. Well, since you stick to it, even if that were
possible, I could not take back my signature to the contract
for the purchase of a notary’s practice in two months
time.

DOCTOR. All these—

GEORGE. You won’t tell me that I have been imprudent
because I have not disposed of my wife’s dowry till
after the honeymoon—

DOCTOR. All these considerations are foreign to me. I
am a physician, nothing but a physician. I can only tell
you this: if you marry before three or four years have
elapsed you will be a criminal.

GEORGE. No, no, you are more than a physician: you are
a confessor as well. You are not only a man of science.
You can’t observe me as you would something in your
laboratory and then simply say: ‘You have this, science
says that. Now be off with you.’ My whole life depends
upon you. You must listen to me; because when you
know everything you will understand the situation and191
will find the means to cure me in a month.

DOCTOR. I can only tell you over and over again that
no such means exist. It is impossible to be certain of
your cure—as far as one can be certain—under three or
four years.

GEORGE. I tell you that you must find one. Listen to
me: if I am not married, I shall not get the dowry. Will
you kindly tell me how I am to carry out the contract I
have signed?

DOCTOR. Oh, if that is the question, it is very simple. I
can easily shew you the way out of the difficulty. Get into
touch with some rich man, do everything you can to
gain his confidence, and when you have succeeded, rook
him of all he has.

GEORGE. I’m not in the mood for joking.

DOCTOR. I am not joking. To rob that man, or even to
murder him, would not be a greater crime than you would
commit in marrying a young girl in good health to get
hold of her dowry, if to do so you exposed her to the terrible
consequences of the disease you would give her.

GEORGE. Terrible?

DOCTOR. Terrible; and death is not the worst of them.

GEORGE. But you told me just now—

DOCTOR. Just now I did not tell you everything. This
disease, even when it is all but suppressed, still lies below
the surface ready to break out again. Taken all round,
it is serious enough to make it an infamy to expose a
woman to it in order to avoid even the greatest inconvenience.

GEORGE. But is it certain that she would catch it?

DOCTOR. Even with the best intentions, I won’t tell you
lies. No; it is not absolutely certain. It is probable. And
there is something else I will tell you. Our remedies are
not infallible. In a certain number of cases—a very small
number, scarcely five per cent.—they have no effect. You
may be one of these exceptions or your wife may be. In
that case—I will use an expression you used just now—in192
that case the result would be the most frightful horrors.

GEORGE. Give me your advice.

DOCTOR. The only advice I can give you is not to marry.
To put it in this way, you owe a debt. Perhaps its repayment
will not be exacted; but at the same time your
creditor may come down on you suddenly, after a long
interval, with the most pitiless brutality. Come, come!
You are a man of business. Marriage is a contract. If you
marry without saying anything, you will be giving an
implied warranty for goods which you know to be bad.
That is the term, isn’t it? It would be a fraud which
ought to be punishable by law.

GEORGE. But what can I do?

DOCTOR. Go to your father-in-law and tell him the unvarnished
truth.

GEORGE. If I do that, it will not be a delay of three or
four years that he will impose on me. He will refuse his
consent for good.

DOCTOR. In that case, tell him nothing.

GEORGE. If I don’t give him a reason, I don’t know what
he won’t do. He is a man of the most violent temper. Besides,
it will be still worse for Henriette than for me. Look
here, doctor; from what I have said to you, no doubt you
think I simply care for the money. Well, I do think it is
one’s primary duty to make certain of a reasonable amount
of comfort. From my youth upwards I have always
been taught that. Nowadays one must think of it, and I
should never have engaged myself to a girl without money.
It’s perfectly natural. [With emotion] But she is so
splendid, she is so much better than I am that I love her—as
people love one another in books. Of course it would
be a frightful disappointment not to have the practice that
I have bought, but that would not be the worst for me. The
worst would be losing her. If you could see her, if you
knew her, you would understand. [Taking out his pocket
book] Look here, here’s her photograph. Just look at it.
[The doctor gently refuses it]. Oh, my darling, to think193
that I must lose you or else—Ah! [He kisses the photograph,
then puts it back in his pocket]. I beg your pardon.
I am being ridiculous. I know I am sometimes. Only put
yourself in my place. I love her so.

DOCTOR. It is on that account that you must not marry
her.

GEORGE. But how can I get out of it? If I draw back
without saying anything the truth will leak out and I
shall be dishonored.

DOCTOR. There is nothing dishonorable about being ill.

GEORGE. Ah, yes. But people are such idiots. Even
yesterday I myself should have laughed at anyone I knew
who was in the position that I am in now. Why, I should
have avoided him as if he had the plague. Oh, if I were
the only one to suffer! But she—she loves me, I swear
she does, she is so good. It will be dreadful for her.

DOCTOR. Less so than it would be later.

GEORGE. There’ll be a scandal.

DOCTOR. You will avoid a bigger one.

George quietly puts two twenty-franc pieces on the desk,
takes his gloves, hat and stick, and gets up.

GEORGE. I will think it over. Thank you, doctor. I
shall come back next week as you told me to—probably.
[He goes towards the door].

DOCTOR [rising] No: I shall not see you next week,
and what is more you will not think it over. You came
here knowing what you had, with the express intention
of not acting by my advice unless it agreed with your
wishes. A flimsy honesty made you take this chance of
pacifying your conscience. You wanted to have someone
on whom you could afterwards throw the responsibility
of an act you knew to be culpable. Don’t protest. Many
who come here think as you think and do what you want
to do. But when they have married in opposition to my
advice the results have been for the most part so calamitous
that now I am almost afraid of not having been persuasive
enough. I feel as though in spite of everything I194
were in some sort the cause of their misery. I ought to be
able to prevent such misery. If only the people who are
the cause of it knew what I know and had seen what I have
seen, it would be impossible. Give me your word that you
will break off your engagement.

GEORGE. I can’t give you my word. I can only repeat:
I will think it over.

DOCTOR. Think over what?

GEORGE. What you have told me.

DOCTOR. But what I have told you is true. You cannot
make any fresh objections. I have answered those you
have made. You must be convinced.

GEORGE. Well, of course you are right in thinking that
I posted myself up a bit before coming to see you. In the
first place, is it certain that I have the disease you think?
You say so, and perhaps it is true. But even the greatest
doctors are sometimes deceived. Haven’t I heard that
Ricord, your master, used to maintain that this disease
was not always contagious? He produced cases to prove
his point. Now you produce fresh cases to disprove it.
Very well. But I have the right to think it over. And
when I think it over, I realize the results you threaten me
with are only probable. In spite of your desire to frighten
me, you have been compelled to admit that my marriage
will quite possibly produce no ill results for my wife.

DOCTOR [restraining himself with difficulty] Go on. I
will answer you.

GEORGE. You tell me that your drugs are powerful, and
that for the catastrophes you speak of to happen I must
be one of the five exceptions per cent. you allow, and
that my wife must be an exception too. Now, if a mathematician
calculated the probabilities of the case, the
chance of a catastrophe would prove so small that, when
the slight probability of a disaster was set against the
certainty of all the disappointments and the unhappiness
and perhaps the tragedies which my breaking off the
match would cause, he would undoubtedly come to the195
conclusion that I was right and you were wrong. After
all, mathematics is more scientific than medicine.

DOCTOR. Ah, you think so! Well, you are wrong.
Twenty cases identical with yours have been carefully observed—from
the beginning to the end. Nineteen times—you
hear, nineteen times in twenty—the woman was
contaminated by her husband. You think that the danger
is negligeable: you think you have the right to make
your wife take her chance, as you said, of being one of the
exceptions for which we can do nothing! Very well: then
you shall know what you are doing. You shall know what
sort of disease it is that your wife will have five chances
per cent. of contracting without so much as having her
leave asked. Take this book—it is my master’s work—here,
read for yourself, I have marked the passage. You
won’t read it? Then I will. [He reads passionately] ‘I
have seen an unfortunate young woman changed by this
disease into the likeness of a beast. The face, or I should
rather say, what remained of it, was nothing but a flat
surface seamed with scars.’

GEORGE. Stop, for pity’s sake, stop!

DOCTOR. I shall not stop. I shall read to the end. I shall
not refrain from doing right merely for fear of upsetting
your nerves. [He goes on] ‘Of the upper lip, which had
been completely eaten away, not a trace remained.’
There, that will do. And you are willing to run the risk
of inflicting that disease on a woman whom you say you
love, though you cannot support even the description of
it yourself? And pray, from whom did that woman catch
syphilis? It is not I who say all this: it is this book. ‘From
a man whose criminal folly was such that he was not afraid
to enter into marriage in an eruption, as was afterwards
established, of marked secondary symptoms, and who had
further thought fit not to have his wife treated for fear of
arousing suspicion.’ What that man did is what you want
to do.

GEORGE. I should deserve all those names and worse196
still, if I were to be married with the knowledge that my
marriage would bring about such horrors. But I do not
believe that it would. You and your masters are specialists.
Consequently you fix the whole of your attention
on the subject of your studies, and you think that these
dreadful, exceptional cases never have enough light
thrown on them. They exercise a sort of fascination over
you.

DOCTOR. I know that argument.

GEORGE. Let me go on, I beg. You have told me that
one man in every seven is a syphilitic, and further that
there are a hundred thousand such men going about the
streets of Paris in perfect health.

DOCTOR. It is the fact that there are a hundred thousand
who are not for the moment visibly affected by their
complaint. But thousands have passed through our hospitals,
victims to the most frightful ravages that our poor
bodies can endure. You do not see them: they do not exist
for you. Again, if it were only yourself who was in
question, you might take that line well enough. But
what I affirm, and repeat with all the strength of my conviction,
is that you have no right to expose a human being
to this appalling chance. The chance is rare, I know: I
know still better how terrible it is. What have you to say
now?

GEORGE. Nothing. I suppose you are right. I don’t
know what to think.

DOCTOR. Is it as if I were forbidding you ever to marry
when I forbid you to marry now? Is it as if I were telling
you that you will never be cured? On the contrary, I
give you every hope. Only I ask a delay of three or four
years, because in that time I shall be able to ascertain
whether you are one of those unhappy wretches for
whom there is no hope, and because during that time
you will be a source of danger to your wife and children.
The children: I have not spoken to you about them.
[Very gently and persuasively] Come, my dear sir, you197
are too young and too generous to be insensible to pity.
There are things that cannot fail to move you: it is
incredible that I should not be able to touch or to convince
you. Indeed, I feel most deeply for you; but on that
account I implore you all the more earnestly to consider
what I say. You have admitted you have no right to expose
your wife to such torture: but there is not only your
wife—there are her children, your children, whom you
may contaminate too. For the moment I will not think
of you or of her: it is in the name of those innocent little
ones that I appeal to you; it is the future of the race that
I am defending. Listen to me. Of the twenty marriages
I spoke of only fifteen produced children. They produced
twenty-eight. Do you know how many of them
survived? Three: three out of twenty-eight. Above all
else syphilis is a child-murderer. Ah, yes! Every year
produces a fresh massacre of the innocents: Herod still
reigns in France and all the world over. And though it
is my business to preserve life, I tell you that those who
die are the lucky ones. If you want to see the children of
syphilitic parents, go round the children’s hospitals. We
know the type: it has become classical. Any doctor can
pick them out from the rest; little creatures old from their
birth, stamped with the marks of every human infirmity
and decay. You will find children with every kind of affliction:
hump-backed, deformed, club-footed, hare-lipped,
ricketty, with heads too big and bodies too small, with congenital
hip-disease. A large proportion of all these are the
victims of parents who were married in ignorance of what
you now know. If I could, I would cry it aloud from the
housetops. [A slight pause] I have told you all this
without the slightest exaggeration. Think it over. Weigh
the pro and the con: tot up the sum of possible suffering
and certain misery. But remember that on the one side
is your own suffering—and on the other the suffering of
other people. Remember that. Distrust yourself.

GEORGE. Very well. I give in. I will not be married. I198
will invent some excuse. I will get it put off for six months.
More than that is impossible.

DOCTOR. I must have three years at least, if not four.

GEORGE. No, no. For pity’s sake! You can cure me before
that.

DOCTOR. No, no, no!

GEORGE. Yes, you can. I implore you. Science can do
everything.

DOCTOR. Science is not God Almighty. The day of
miracles is past.

GEORGE. Oh, you could, if you wanted to. I know you
could. Invent something, discover something! Try some
new treatment on me. Double the doses! Give me ten
times the ordinary ones, if you like! I’ll stand anything,
absolutely. Only there must be some way of curing me
in six months. Look here, I can’t be responsible for myself
after that. For the sake of my wife and her children,
do something.

DOCTOR. Nonsense.

GEORGE. If only you’ll cure me, I don’t know what I
won’t do for you. I’ll be grateful to you all my life. I’ll
give you half my fortune. For God’s sake, do something
for me!

DOCTOR. You want me to do more for you than for all
the rest?

GEORGE. Yes.

DOCTOR. Let me tell you, sir, that everyone of our patients,
whether he is the richest man in the land or the
poorest, has everything done for him that we can do. We
have no secrets in reserve for the rich or for people who
are in a hurry to be cured.

GEORGE. Good-bye, doctor.

DOCTOR. Good-day.

ACT II

George’s study. To the left a window. In front of the
window a desk of moderate size, facing away from the
audience, and a writing chair. On the desk a telephone.
To the right of the desk an arm chair, a small table with a
work box and embroidery, and between the window and the
footlights a deep easy chair. At the back a dainty bookcase,
and in front of it a pretty table with flowers. At the back to
the right a door, and, nearer, a piano and a music stool.
To the left another door. Two small chairs.

Henriette is sitting by the small table and working at a
baby’s cap. After a moment she holds it up on her hand.

HENRIETTE. Another little cap to send to nurse. How
sweet my little Germaine will look in it! Come, sweetheart,
laugh at mother! Oh, my love! [She kisses the cap
and goes on working].

George enters at the back.

GEORGE [opening the door and taking off his coat in the
hall] Hullo! Are you there? Are you there? Ha, ha, ha!

HENRIETTE [rising gaily] Oh, you know I recognized
your voice.

GEORGE. What a story! [Kissing her] Poor little darling,
was she taken in, poor little woman! Ha, ha, ha!

HENRIETTE [laughing too] Don’t laugh like that!

GEORGE. ‘Hullo! Hullo! Madame George Dupont?’
[Imitating a woman’s timid voice] ‘Yes, yes. I am here.’
I could feel you blushing at the end of the wire.

HENRIETTE [laughing] I didn’t say ‘I am here’ in that
voice. I simply answered ‘Yes.’

200

GEORGE. ‘Hullo, Madame George Dupont. Is George
there?’ [Laughing] You were taken in! You can’t say
you weren’t. [In the woman’s voice] ‘George is out. Who
is it speaking to me?’ I could hardly keep it up. ‘Me,
Gustave.’ You thought it was, too.

HENRIETTE. What is there astonishing in your friend
Gustave telephoning?

GEORGE. And when I added [imitating Gustave’s
voice] ‘How are you this morning, dearest?’ you gave a
’What?’ all flustered, like that: ‘What?’

HENRIETTE. Yes, but then I guessed it was you.

GEORGE. I went into fits. What a lark! [He sits down
in front of her on the arm of the chair close to the fireplace
and watches her happily].

HENRIETTE [sitting down and returning his glance]
What a funny little fellow you are!

GEORGE. Me?

HENRIETTE [gaily] Do you think I don’t understand
you, after knowing you for fifteen years and being married
to you a twelvemonth?

GEORGE [curious] Ah! well, go on. Say what you think
of me.

HENRIETTE. To begin with, you’re anxious. Then you’re
jealous. And suspicious. You spend all your time in
making a tangle of things and then inventing ingenious
ways of getting out of it.

GEORGE [happy to hear himself talked about] So that’s
what you think of me? Go on, let us have some more.

HENRIETTE. Isn’t it true?

GEORGE [admitting it with a laugh] Well?

HENRIETTE. Wasn’t it a trap that you set for me this
morning?

GEORGE [in the same tone] No.

HENRIETTE. Yes; you wanted to be sure that I had not
gone out. You asked me not to go to the Louvre to-day.

GEORGE [innocently] So I did.

HENRIETTE. See how suspicious you are, even of me.

201

GEORGE. No; not of you.

HENRIETTE. Yes, you are. But you have always been,
so I don’t mind. And then I know at the bottom you feel
things so keenly that it makes you rather afraid.

GEORGE [seriously] I was laughed at so much when I
was a boy.

HENRIETTE [gaily] Besides, perhaps you have reasons
for not having too much confidence in men’s friendships
with their friends’ wives. Gay deceiver!

GEORGE [laughing] I should like to know what you
mean by that.

HENRIETTE. Suppose I had thought it was Gustave and
answered: ‘Very well, thanks. How are you, darling?’

GEORGE [laughing] Well, it is a trick that I shouldn’t
like to try on everyone. [Changing the conversation] By
the way, as I came in Justin spoke to me.

HENRIETTE. Well?

GEORGE. He says he wants a rise.

HENRIETTE. He has chosen a likely moment.

GEORGE. Hasn’t he? I asked him if the sale of my cigars
was not enough for him.

HENRIETTE. How did he take that?

GEORGE. He lost his temper and gave warning. This
time I took him at his word. He’s simply furious.

HENRIETTE. Good.

GEORGE. He’ll go at the end of the month and we shall
be well rid of him. Mother will be delighted. I say, she
hasn’t wired, has she?

HENRIETTE. No.

GEORGE. Then she’s not coming back till to-morrow.

HENRIETTE. If she had her way, she would never leave
our little girl.

GEORGE. You’re not going to be jealous, are you?

HENRIETTE. I’m a little anxious. Still, if there had been
anything the matter, I know your mother would have
telegraphed to us.

GEORGE. We agreed that she should, if there was any202thing
since yesterday.

HENRIETTE. Perhaps after all we should have done better
to keep baby with us.

GEORGE. Oh, are you going to begin again?

HENRIETTE. No, no. Don’t scold. I know the air of
Paris didn’t suit her.

GEORGE. You still think that the dust of my papers was
better for her than the air of the country.

HENRIETTE [laughing] No; I don’t.

GEORGE. Of course, there is the square, with the smell
of fried fish and all the soldiers.

HENRIETTE. Don’t tease. I know you are right.

GEORGE. Aha! I’m glad you admit that for once in a
way.

HENRIETTE. Besides, nurse takes good care of her. She
is a good girl.

GEORGE. And how proud she is to nurse the grand-daughter
of her deputy.

HENRIETTE. Father is not deputy for that district. All
the same—

GEORGE. All the same he is deputy for the department.

HENRIETTE. Yes; he is.

GEORGE. Can’t you hear her talking to her friends?
[Imitating the nurse’s voice] ‘Haven’t I had a bit of luck,
neither? Yes, ma’am; she’s our deputy’s daughter’s
daughter, she is. She’s as fat as a calf, the little duck; and
that clever with it, she understands everything. That’s
not a bit of luck neither, isn’t it?’

HENRIETTE [laughing] You great silly! She doesn’t
talk like that at all.

GEORGE. Why not say at once that I can’t do imitations?

HENRIETTE. Now I didn’t say that.

GEORGE. As if mother would have engaged nurse for us
if she had not been absolutely certain that baby would be
well looked after. Besides, she goes down to see her every
week, and she would have brought her back already—

203

HENRIETTE. Twice a week sometimes.

GEORGE. Yes.

HENRIETTE. Ah, our little Germaine knows what it is
to have a granny who dotes on her.

GEORGE. Doesn’t she, though?

HENRIETTE. Your mother is so good. You know I adore
her, too.

GEORGE. Runs in the family!

HENRIETTE. Do you know, the last time we went down
there with her—you had gone out somewhere or other—

GEORGE. To see that old sixteenth century chest.

HENRIETTE [laughing] Of course, your wonderful chest.

GEORGE. Well, what were you going to say?

HENRIETTE. You were out, and nurse had gone to mass,
I think.

GEORGE. Or to have a drink. Go on.

HENRIETTE. I was in the little room, and your mother
thought she was alone with Germaine. But I could hear
her: she was telling baby all sorts of sweet little things—silly
little things, but so sweet that I felt laughing and
crying at the same moment.

GEORGE. Didn’t she call her ‘my own little Saviour’?

HENRIETTE. Why, were you listening?

GEORGE. No; but that’s what she used to call me once
on a time.

HENRIETTE. It was that day she said she was sure baby
had recognized her and laughed at her.

GEORGE. One day, too, I went into mother’s room here.
The door was ajar, so that she didn’t hear me come in;
and I found her looking at one of the little christening
slippers she wanted baby to have, you know.

HENRIETTE. Oh, yes.

GEORGE. And then she took it up and kissed it.

HENRIETTE. What did you say to her?

GEORGE. Nothing. I went out as softly as I could and
blew a kiss to her from the other side of the door.

HENRIETTE. When nurse’s letter came the other day,204
it didn’t take her long to get ready and catch the 8.59.

GEORGE. However, there wasn’t anything the matter.

HENRIETTE. No; but still perhaps she was right. Perhaps
I should have gone with her.

GEORGE. Poor innocent little Henriette! You believe
everything you are told. Now I saw at once what was up.
The nurse simply wanted to humbug us into raising her
screw. I bet she did. Look here, will you bet me she didn’t?
Come, what will you have? Look here. I bet you that
lovely necklace—you know, the one with the big pearl.

HENRIETTE. No; I should be too much afraid of winning.

GEORGE [laughing] Silly! I believe you think I don’t
care for baby as much as you do. Why, you don’t even
know how old she is! No, no, exactly! Let’s see. Aha!
Ninety-one days and eight hours, there! [He laughs].
Ah, when she can get on by herself, then we’ll have her
back with us. Six months more to wait.

HENRIETTE. Six months is a long time to wait. When
I think that if you had not put off our marriage for six
months, we should have her back now!

GEORGE. I have told you over and over again that I only
did what was right. Just consider; how could I marry
when the doctor told me I had traces of consumption?

HENRIETTE. Your doctor is a donkey. As if you looked
like a consumptive!

GEORGE. Generally speaking, doctors are a bit that way,
I grant.

HENRIETTE. And you actually wanted to wait three or
four years.

GEORGE. Yes; to be quite certain I had nothing wrong
with my lungs.

HENRIETTE. You call me innocent, me! And here were
you, just because a doctor—

GEORGE. But you know it seems that I really had the
beginning of some bronchial trouble. I used to feel something
when I breathed rather hard—like that, only a little205
harder. There, that’s it. There was a sort of heaviness
each side of my chest.

HENRIETTE. It wasn’t anything to put off our marriage
for.

GEORGE [getting up] Yes, yes; I assure you I was right.
I should have been wrong to expose you to the chance of
having a consumptive husband. No; I’m not at all sorry
we waited. Still, those specialists—I can afford to laugh
at them now. If I knew someone now who was ill, I should
tell him: ‘My dear chap, those bigwigs at forty francs a
consultation—well, just don’t you consult them, you
know!’

HENRIETTE. That one wanted four years to cure you!

GEORGE. Hang it, doctors are only men. After all they
must live; and when their consultations are forty francs
apiece, why, the more the merrier.

HENRIETTE. And some quite unknown little doctor
cured you in three months!

GEORGE. Yes; he was quite unknown. The odd thing
is I have absolutely forgotten his address. I found it in
the paper, I remember. I know vaguely that it was somewhere
near the Halles; but if I was to have my head
chopped off for it, I couldn’t find it again. Idiotic, isn’t it?

HENRIETTE. Consequently, Germaine is six months less
old than she ought to be.

GEORGE. What of that? We shall keep her so much the
longer. She will be married six months later, that’s all.

HENRIETTE. Oh, don’t speak of it. It’s odious to think
even now that we shall lose her some day.

GEORGE. Ah! I can see myself going up the steps of the
Madeleine with her on my arm.

HENRIETTE. Why the Madeleine?

GEORGE. I don’t know. She’ll have on a great white
veil and I shall have an order in my buttonhole.

HENRIETTE. Indeed! Pray what will you have done to
get an order?

GEORGE. I don’t know, but I shall have one. Say what206
you like, I shall. What a glorious crowd there’ll be!

HENRIETTE. That’s all in the dim, distant future.

GEORGE. Ah, yes.

HENRIETTE. Yes, happily. [Getting up] Well, do you
mind if I go and pay my visits now?

GEORGE. Run along, run along. I shall work hard while
you are out. Look at all these papers! I shall be up to my
eyes in them before you’re downstairs. Good-bye.

HENRIETTE. Good-bye. [She kisses him and goes out
at the back by the right].

George lights a cigarette, looks at himself in the glass,
and throws himself into the easy chair to the left, humming
a tune. By way of being more comfortable, he moves away
the writing chair and puts his feet on the desk, smoking and
humming in perfect contentment. Madame Dupont comes
in by the door on the left.

GEORGE [getting up] Hullo! Why, mother! We had
no wire, so we didn’t expect you till to-morrow. Henriette
has just gone out. I can call her back.

MME. DUPONT. No; I did not want Henriette to be here
when I came.

GEORGE. What’s the matter?

The conversation that follows is broken by long silences.

MME. DUPONT. I have brought back the child and the
nurse.

GEORGE. Is baby ill?

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

GEORGE. What’s wrong with her?

MME. DUPONT. Nothing serious; at least for the moment.

GEORGE. We must send for the doctor.

MME. DUPONT. I have just come from the doctor’s.

GEORGE. Good. I’m not going out. I’ll wait for him.

MME. DUPONT. I have seen him.

GEORGE. Ah, you found him in?

MME. DUPONT. I telegraphed to him from the country,
took the child to see him.

207

GEORGE. It was so urgent as that?

MME. DUPONT. After what the nurse’s doctor had told
me, I wished to be reassured immediately.

GEORGE. And after all there is nothing serious.

MME. DUPONT. For the moment.

GEORGE. When you got down there, how did you find
baby?

MME. DUPONT Fairly well, but I sent for the doctor at
once.

GEORGE. What did he say?

MME. DUPONT. That you must make a change; that the
child must be brought up on the bottle.

GEORGE. What an extraordinary idea.

MME. DUPONT. He told me that what she was suffering
from might become very serious. So without saying anything
to nurse, I made her come with me and we took the
train back.

GEORGE. Well, what is the matter with the child?

MME. DUPONT [after a thoughtful pause] I do not know.

GEORGE. Didn’t you ask him?

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

GEORGE [beginning to be anxious] Well?

A silence.

MME. DUPONT. He replied evasively.

GEORGE [tonelessly] He probably did not know himself.

MME. DUPONT [after a silence] Probably.

During what follows they avoid looking at one another.

GEORGE. But our own doctor, didn’t he say—?

MME. DUPONT. It was not to him that I went.

GEORGE. Ah! [A very long silence. Then lower] Why?

MME. DUPONT. The nurse’s doctor had so terrified me.

GEORGE. Seriously?

MME. DUPONT. Yes: it is a disease—[Silence]

GEORGE [in anguish] Well?

MME. DUPONT. I asked him if the matter was too serious
for our own doctor to deal with.

208

GEORGE. What did he answer?

MME. DUPONT. That if we had the means it would be
preferable to see a specialist.

GEORGE [trying to pull himself together] And—where
did he send you?

MME. DUPONT [handing him a visiting card] There.

GEORGE. He sent you to that doctor?

MME. DUPONT. Yes. Do you know him?

GEORGE. No—Yes—I think I have met him—I don’t
know. [Very low] My God!

MME. DUPONT [after a silence] He is coming to speak
to you.

GEORGE [scarcely daring to pronounce the words] Then
is he anxious?

MME. DUPONT. No. He wants to speak to you.

GEORGE. He wants to speak to me?

MME. DUPONT. Yes.

GEORGE [resigning himself] Very well.

MME. DUPONT. When he saw the nurse, whom I had left
in the waiting room, he called me back and said: ‘It is
impossible for me to continue attending on this child unless
I can see its father and speak to him at once.’ I answered
’Very well,’ and gave him your address. He will
not be long.

GEORGE [to himself in a low voice] My poor little child!

MME. DUPONT [looking at him] Yes, she is a poor little
child.

GEORGE [after a long silence] Mother—

MME. DUPONT [hearing the door opened] Hush! [A
maid comes in and speaks to her. To George] It is he!
[To the maid] Show him in. [To George] I shall be there
if you want me.

She goes out by the left. The doctor enters by the right.

DOCTOR [to the maid] You will let me know here when
the child wakes up, will you not?

MAID. Yes, sir.

She goes out.

209

GEORGE [with the greatest emotion] Good day, doctor:
you don’t recognize me?

DOCTOR [simply: more discouraged than angry] You—it
is you. You married and had a child after all I said
to you. [Almost to himself] Scoundrel.

GEORGE. Let me explain.

DOCTOR. I can listen to no explanation of what you
have done.

A silence.

GEORGE [imploring him] You will look after my little
girl all the same, won’t you?

DOCTOR [shrugging his shoulders. Low] Fool!

GEORGE [not hearing] I could only get my marriage
put off six months.

DOCTOR. Enough, enough. That is not my business. I
was wrong even to show you my indignation. I should
have left you to judge yourself. I am here only concerned
with the present and the future, with the child and with
the nurse.

GEORGE. She is not in danger?

DOCTOR. The nurse is in danger of being contaminated.

GEORGE. No, but—my child?

DOCTOR. For the moment the symptoms are not disquieting.

GEORGE. Thank you. [More easily] About the nurse—you
were saying—Do you mind if I call my mother?
She knows more about these things than I do.

DOCTOR. As you please.

GEORGE [going to the door and coming back much moved]
There is one thing I should like to ask you. Could you
contrive that no one—my wife—should know what has
happened? If my poor wife knew that it was I who was
the cause—it is for her sake that I beg you. She is not to
blame.

DOCTOR. I promise you that I will do everything in my
power to save her from learning the real nature of the
child’s illness.

210

GEORGE. Oh, thank you, thank you.

DOCTOR. You need not. If I tell lies, it will be for her
sake and not for yours.

GEORGE. And my mother?

DOCTOR. Your mother knows the truth.

GEORGE. But—

DOCTOR. Please, please. We have many very serious
matters to discuss.

George goes to the door and brings in his mother. She
bows to the doctor, makes a sign to him to be seated in the
armchair near the fireplace, and sits down herself on the
chair near the little table. George takes a seat to the left in
front of the desk.

DOCTOR. I have written a prescription for the child
which will, I hope, improve its condition and prevent any
fresh disorders. But my duty, and yours, does not stop
there. If it is not too late, the health of the nurse must be
protected.

MME. DUPONT. Tell us what we must do.

DOCTOR. She must stop giving milk to the child.

MME. DUPONT. You mean that we must change the
nurse?

DOCTOR. No. I mean that the child cannot continue
to be fed at the breast either by this nurse or by any
healthy nurse.

MME. DUPONT. Why?

DOCTOR. Because the child would communicate its
complaint to the person who gave it milk.

MME. DUPONT. But, doctor, if the baby is brought up on
the bottle it will die.

GEORGE [breaking into sobs] Oh, my poor little girl!
Oh, my God, it’s me! Oh! Oh!

DOCTOR. Careful treatment, with sterilized milk—

MME. DUPONT. That may succeed with healthy children,
but at the age of three months a sickly child such as
ours cannot be fed by hand. Such a child has all the more
need of being fed at the breast. That is true?

211

DOCTOR. Yes; but—

MME. DUPONT. In that case you will realize that between
the life of the child and the health of a nurse I have no
choice.

GEORGE [sobbing] Oh! Oh! Oh!

DOCTOR. Your affection leads you to express an incredible
sentiment. But it is not for you to choose. I shall
forbid the child to be brought up at the breast. The
health of this woman does not belong to you.

MME. DUPONT. Nor the life of our child to you. If
there is one way to save its life, it is to give it every possible
attention, and you want me to treat it in a way that
you doctors condemn even for healthy children. My little
one! You think I will let her die like that! Oh, I shall
take good care she does not. Neglect the one single thing
that can save her! It would be criminal. As for the nurse,
we will indemnify her. We will do everything in our
power, everything but that. No, no, no! Whatever can
be done for our baby shall be done, cost what it may. But
that—You don’t consider what you are asking. It would
be as if I killed my child. [Bursting into tears] Oh, my
little angel, my own little Saviour!

George has not stopped sobbing since he first began. At
his mother’s last words his sobs become almost cries. His
anguish is pitiable to see.

GEORGE. Oh, oh, oh! My little child! My little child!
Oh, oh! [In an undertone] Oh, what a scoundrel I am!
What a criminal!

DOCTOR. Calm yourself, madam, I beg. You will not
improve matters in this way. Try to consider them coolly.

MME. DUPONT. You are right. I beg your pardon. But
if you knew how much this child is to me. I lost one at
the same age. I am old and widowed—I did not expect to
live to see my grandchildren. You are right. George, be
calm—we will show our love by being calm. Now then,
we will talk seriously and coldly. But I warn you that you
will not succeed in making me consent to any but the very212
best conditions for the child. I shall not let her be killed
by being taken from the breast!

DOCTOR. This is not the first time I have found myself
in this situation, and I must begin by telling you that
parents who have refused to be guided by my advice have
invariably repented of it most bitterly.

MME. DUPONT. The only thing of which I shall repent—

DOCTOR. You are evidently unaware of what the rapacity
and malice of peasants such as this nurse are capable,
especially against those of superior station. In this
case, moreover, her enmity would be legitimate.

MME. DUPONT. Oh! What can she do?

DOCTOR. She can bring an action against you.

MME. DUPONT. She is far too stupid to think of such a
thing.

DOCTOR. Others will put it into her head.

MME. DUPONT. She is too poor to pay the expenses of
going to law.

DOCTOR. Then you propose to profit by her ignorance
and her poverty? Besides, she could obtain the assistance
of the court.

MME. DUPONT. Never! Surely, never.

DOCTOR. Indeed? For my part I know at least ten such
cases. In every case where the fact was proved, judgment
was given against the parents.

MME. DUPONT. Not in a case like this! Not where the
life of a poor innocent little child was at stake. You must
be mistaken.

DOCTOR. Many of the facts have been identical. I can
give you the dates.

GEORGE [rising] I have the law reports here. [He takes
a volume and hands it to the doctor].

MME. DUPONT. It is needless.

DOCTOR [to George] You can convince yourself. In one
or two cases the parents have been ordered to pay a yearly
pension to the nurse; in the others sums of money varying
from three to eight thousand francs.

213

MME. DUPONT. If we had to fight an action, we should
retain the very best lawyer on our side. Thank heaven we
are rich enough. No doubt he would make it appear
doubtful whether the child had not caught this disease
from the nurse, rather than the nurse from the child.

DOCTOR. Allow me to point out that such conduct would
be atrocious.

MME. DUPONT. Oh, it is a lawyer’s business to do such
things. I should not have to say anything. In any case
you may be sure that he would win our suit.

DOCTOR. And have you considered the scandal that
would ensue.

GEORGE [turning to a page in the reports] Here is the
judgment you were speaking of—six thousand francs.

DOCTOR. You can make Madame Dupont read it afterwards.
Since you have the reports there, kindly give me
the volume before this. [George goes again to the bookcase.
To Madame Dupont] Have you thought of the
scandal?

GEORGE [coming back] But, doctor, allow me to point
out: in reports of this kind the names are suppressed.

DOCTOR. They are not suppressed in court.

GEORGE. True.

DOCTOR. Are you sure that no paper would publish a
full account of the case?

MME. DUPONT. Oh, how infamous!

DOCTOR. You see what a horrible scandal it would be
for you. [George nods] A catastrophe, absolutely.

GEORGE. Particularly for a notary like me. [He goes to
get the other volume].

MME. DUPONT. We will prevent her from bringing an
action. We will give her what she wants.

DOCTOR. Then you will expose yourself to be indefinitely
blackmailed. I know one family which has paid hush-money
of this kind for twelve years.

GEORGE. We could make her sign a receipt.

DOCTOR. In full settlement of all claims?

214

GEORGE. Exactly so. Here is the volume.

MME. DUPONT. She would be only too glad to go back
to her people with enough money to buy a little house and
a plot of land. To a woman of her position it would be
wealth.

The nurse comes in.

NURSE. Baby’s waked up, sir.

DOCTOR. I will come and see her. [To Madame Dupont]
We will finish what we were saying presently.

MME. DUPONT. Very well. Do you want the nurse?

DOCTOR. No, thank you.

The doctor goes out.

MME. DUPONT. Nurse, just wait a minute. I want to
speak to you. [In an undertone to her son] I know how
we can manage. If we warn her and she agrees to stay,
the doctor will have nothing more to say, will he?

GEORGE. I suppose not.

MME. DUPONT. I will promise her two thousand francs
when she goes if she consents to stay on as wet-nurse.

GEORGE. Is that enough, do you think?

MME. DUPONT. At any rate I will try. If she hesitates I
will make it more.

GEORGE. All right.

MME. DUPONT [turning to the nurse] Nurse, you know
that baby is a little ill.

NURSE. Oh no, ma’am.

MME. DUPONT. Indeed she is.

NURSE. I’ve looked after her as well as possible, I know
I have, ma’am.

MME. DUPONT. I do not say you have not. But she is ill:
the doctors say so.

NURSE. That’s a fine story! As if doctors weren’t always
finding something, so that you mayn’t think they
don’t know their business!

MME. DUPONT. But our doctor is a great doctor; and you
have seen yourself that baby has little pimples.

NURSE. Oh ma’am, that’s nothing but the heat of her215
blood. Don’t you worry about it, I tell you it’s only the
strength of her blood. It isn’t my fault. I’ve always done
everything for her and kept her that clean and proper.

MME. DUPONT. No one says that it is your fault.

NURSE. Then what are you finding fault with me about?
Ah, there isn’t anything the matter with her. The pretty
little darling, she’s a regular town baby she is, just a bit
poorly; but she’s all right, I promise you.

MME. DUPONT. I tell you she is ill: she has a cold in her
head and there are sores at the back of her throat.

NURSE. Then that’s because the doctor scratched her
with the spoon he put into her mouth by the wrong end.
And if she has a little cold, I don’t know when she caught
it, I’m sure I don’t: I always keep her that well wrapped
up, she has three thicknesses of things on. It must have
been when you came the time before last and opened all
the windows in the house.

MME. DUPONT. But I tell you that nobody is finding
fault with you at all.

NURSE. Oh yes, I know. That’s all very well. I’m only
a poor country girl.

MME. DUPONT. What do you mean?

NURSE. Oh, that’s all very well, it is.

MME. DUPONT. But I have told you over and over again
that we have no fault to find.

NURSE [sticking to her idea] I never expected any unpleasantness
when I came here. [She begins to whimper].

MME. DUPONT. We have no fault to find with you. Only
we want to warn you, you may catch the baby’s illness—

NURSE [sulkily] Well, if I do catch a cold, it won’t be
the first time I’ve had to blow my nose, I suppose.

MME. DUPONT. Perhaps you may get her pimples.

NURSE [sneering] Oh ma’am, we country folks haven’t
got nice, delicate, white skins like Paris ladies have.
When you have to work in the fields all day, rain or shine,
you don’t need to plaster your face all over with cream, I
can tell you. No offence meant, but if you want to find an216
excuse, that isn’t much of a one.

MME. DUPONT. What do you mean? What excuse?

NURSE. Oh yes, I know.

MME. DUPONT. What do you know?

NURSE. I’m only a poor country girl, I am.

MME. DUPONT. I have not the slightest idea what you
mean.

NURSE. Oh, I know what I mean.

MME. DUPONT. Then tell me what you mean.

NURSE. Oh, what’s the good?

MME. DUPONT. Tell me, please? I insist.

NURSE. Oh, very well—

MME. DUPONT. Go on.

NURSE. Oh, all right. I may be only a poor country girl,
but I’m not quite so stupid as that. I know what it is you
want. Just because master’s cross at your having promised
me thirty francs a month more if I came to Paris.
[Turning to George] Well, and what do you expect?
Mustn’t I have my own little boy looked after? And
hasn’t his father got to eat and drink? We’re only poor
country folks, we are.

GEORGE. You’re making a mistake, nurse. There’s nothing
at all the matter. My mother was quite right to
promise you the thirty francs extra, and the only thing
in my mind is that she did not promise you enough. Now
I have decided when baby is old enough to have a dry-nurse
and you leave us, just to show how grateful we are,
to give you, er—

MME. DUPONT. We shall make you a present, you understand,
over and above your wages. We shall give you five
hundred francs, or perhaps a thousand. That is, of course,
if baby is in perfectly good health.

NURSE [stupefied] You’ll give me five hundred francs—for
myself—[Struggling to understand] But you haven’t
got to. We didn’t agree to that.

MME. DUPONT. No.

NURSE [to herself] What’s up, then?

217

MME. DUPONT. It is simply because baby will require
more attention. You will have rather more trouble with
her. You will have to give her her medicine and so on. It
may be a little difficult for you.

NURSE. Ah, I see. So that you may be sure I shall look
after her well. You say to yourself: ‘Nurse has an interest
in her.’ I see.

MME. DUPONT. That is understood, then?

NURSE. Yes, ma’am.

MME. DUPONT. Very good. You will not come afterwards
and complain of the way we have treated you. We
have warned you that the child is ill and that you may
catch her illness. To make up for that, and because you
will have more trouble with her, we will give you five
hundred francs when your time here is over. That is understood?

NURSE. But you said a thousand francs, ma’am.

MME. DUPONT. Very well; a thousand francs, then.

GEORGE [passing to the right behind the other two and
drawing his mother aside] It’s a pity that we can’t get
her to sign that.

MME. DUPONT [to the nurse] So that there may be no
misunderstanding about the sum—you see I forgot just
now that I said a thousand francs—we will draw up a
little paper which we shall sign on our side and you will
sign on your side.

NURSE. Very good, ma’am; I understand.

The doctor comes back.

MME. DUPONT. Here is the doctor. You may go, nurse;
that is all right.

NURSE. Yes, ma’am. [To herself] What’s up, then? A
thousand francs? What’s the matter with the baby? Has
she got something bad, I wonder? [She passes to the left,
between the desk and window, and goes out].

DOCTOR. The condition is unchanged. There is no
need for anxiety. [He sits down at the desk to write a prescription].

218

MME. DUPONT. I am glad to tell you, doctor, that you
can now devote yourself to the baby and the nurse without
misgiving. While you have been away we have informed
the nurse of the circumstances, and agreed with
her that she shall stay with us in return for a certain sum
of money.

DOCTOR. The disease which the nurse will almost infallibly
contract in giving her milk to the child is, I fear, too
serious to be made the subject of a bargain, however large
the sum of money. She might be completely crippled,
even if she did not die of it.

MME. DUPONT. But she accepts.

DOCTOR. It is not only that she would be rendered incapable
of serving in future as wet nurse without danger
to the infants she suckled. The results of the disease to
herself might be inconsiderable; but at the same time, I
repeat, they might, in spite of everything we could do, cast
a terrible blight upon her life.

MME. DUPONT. But I tell you she accepts. She has the
right to do what she pleases.

DOCTOR. I am not sure that she has the right to sell her
own health, but I am sure that she has not the right to
sell the health of her husband and of her children. If she
contracts this disease, she will almost certainly communicate
it to both of them; and, further, the life and health
of any children she might afterwards have would be
gravely endangered. You understand now that it is impossible
for her to make a bargain of this kind. If the mischief
is not already done, every effort must be made to
prevent it.

MME. DUPONT. You say: ‘If the mischief is not done.’
Can you not be certain?

DOCTOR. Not as yet. There is a period of five or six
weeks between the moment of contracting the disease
and the appearance of its first symptoms.

MME. DUPONT. You think of nothing but the nurse. You
do not think of our poor little baby. What can we do?219
We cannot let her die.

GEORGE. We can’t, we can’t!

DOCTOR. Neither can you endanger the life of this woman.

MME. DUPONT. You are not defending our interests!

DOCTOR. I am defending those of the weakest.

MME. DUPONT. If we had called in our own doctor, he
would have taken our side.

DOCTOR. I doubt it. [Rising] But there is still time
to send for him.

GEORGE. Mother! I beg you not to go, doctor.

MME. DUPONT [supplicating him] Oh, don’t abandon
us! You can make allowances—If you only knew what
this child was to me! I feel as if I had staved off death to
wait for it. Have pity on us! Our poor little girl—she is
the weakest, surely. Have pity on her! When you saw
her tiny, suffering body, did you not feel any pity for her?
Oh, I beseech you!

GEORGE. Doctor, we implore you!

DOCTOR. Indeed I pity her and I will do everything in
my power to save her. But you must not ask me to sacrifice
the health of a young and strong woman to that of a
sickly infant. I will be no party to giving this woman a
disease that would embitter the lives of her whole family,
and almost certainly render her sterile.

MME. DUPONT [in a stifled voice] Oh, are there not enough
of these peasants in the world!

DOCTOR. I beg your pardon?

MME. DUPONT [in the same tone] I said that if she had
no more children, there would only be the fewer to be unhappy.

DOCTOR. It is useless for us to continue this discussion.

MME. DUPONT [rousing herself] I shall not take your
advice! I shall not listen to you!

DOCTOR. There is one here already who regrets not
having done so.

GEORGE. Yes, O God, yes!

220

MME. DUPONT [more and more exalted] I do not care!
I do not care if I am punished for it in this world and the
next! If it is a crime, if it is a sin, I accept all the responsibility,
however heavy it may be! Yes, yes! If it must be,
I will lose my soul to save our child’s life, our little one’s!
I know that hell exists for the wicked: that is one of my
profoundest convictions. Then let God judge me—if I
am damned, so much the worse for me!

DOCTOR. I shall not allow you to take that responsibility.
To enable you to do so, my consent would be necessary,
and I refuse it.

MME. DUPONT. What do you mean?

DOCTOR. I shall speak to the nurse and give her the fullest
particulars, which I am convinced you have not done.

MME. DUPONT. What! You, a doctor, would betray
family secrets entrusted to you in the strictest confidence!
Secrets of this kind!

DOCTOR. The betrayal, if it is one, is forced on me by
the law.

MME. DUPONT. The law! I thought you were bound to
secrecy?

DOCTOR [turning the pages of the volume of reports] Not
in this case. Here is a judgment given by the court at
Dijon: I thought that I might have to read it to you.
[Reading] ‘A doctor who knowingly omits to inform a
nurse of the dangers incurred by her in giving milk to a
syphilitic child may be held responsible in damages for
the results caused by her ignorance.’ You see that the law
is against you, as well as your conscience; and I may add
that, even were it not so, I should not allow you to be led
by your feelings into committing such a crime. If you do
not consent to have the child fed by hand, I shall either
speak to the nurse or give up the case.

MME. DUPONT. You dare to threaten us! Oh, you know
the power that your knowledge gives you! You know
what need we are in of your services and that if you abandon
us perhaps our child will die! And if we give way to221
you, she will die all the same! [Wildly] O my God, my
God, why cannot I sacrifice myself? Oh, if only my aged
body could take the place of this woman’s young flesh,
and my poor dry breasts give to our child the milk that
would save her life! With what joy I would give myself
up to this disease! With what rapture I would suffer the
most horrible ravages that it could inflict on me! Oh, if I
could but offer myself, without fear and without regret!

GEORGE [flings himself into her arms with sobs and
cries of] Mother! Mother! Mother!

They weep.

DOCTOR [to himself, moved] Poor people! Poor people!

MME. DUPONT [sitting down with an air of resignation]
Tell us what we must do.

DOCTOR. Keep the nurse here as dry-nurse so that she
may not carry the infection elsewhere. We will feed the
child by hand, and I beg you in all sincerity not to exaggerate
the danger that will result from the change. I
have every hope of restoring the baby to health in a short
space of time; and I assure you that I will use every possible
effort to bring about a happy conclusion. I will call
again to-morrow. Good-day.

MME. DUPONT [without moving] Thank you, doctor.

GEORGE [going to the door and shaking hands] Thank
you, thank you. [The doctor goes out. George comes back
and goes to his mother with outstretched arms] Mother!

MME. DUPONT [repulsing him] Let me be.

GEORGE [checking himself] Are we not unhappy enough,
without hating one another?

MME. DUPONT. It is God who visits upon your child the
sins of its father.

GEORGE [raising his shoulders gloomily] You believe
that: when there is not a man alive so wicked and unjust
as to commit such an act!

MME. DUPONT. Oh, I know you believe in nothing.

GEORGE. Not in that kind of God.

The nurse, who comes in by the left soon after the doctor has
222
gone out, appears.

NURSE. If you please, ma’am, I’ve been thinking: I
would rather go away at once and only have the five hundred
francs.

MME. DUPONT. What do you say? You want to leave us?

NURSE. Yes, ma’am.

GEORGE. But ten minutes ago you didn’t want to.

MME. DUPONT. What has happened?

NURSE. I’ve been thinking.

MME. DUPONT. Thinking! About what?

NURSE. Well, I want to go back to my baby and my
husband.

GEORGE. But ten minutes ago—there must be something
else.

MME. DUPONT. Evidently there is something else.

NURSE. No, ma’am.

MME. DUPONT. But there must be!

NURSE. Well then, I’m afraid that Paris doesn’t suit me.

MME. DUPONT. How can you tell without waiting to try?

NURSE. I’d rather go back home at once.

MME. DUPONT. At least tell us why.

NURSE. I have told you. I’ve been thinking.

MME. DUPONT. What about?

NURSE. I’ve been thinking.

MME. DUPONT. Oh, don’t say that over and over again!
’I’ve been thinking, I’ve been thinking.’ What have you
been thinking about?

NURSE. About everything.

MME. DUPONT. Can’t you tell us about what?

NURSE. I tell you: about everything.

MME. DUPONT. Idiot!

GEORGE [stepping in front of his mother] Let me speak
to her.

NURSE. I know we’re only poor country folk.

GEORGE. Listen to me, nurse. Just now you were not
only satisfied with your wages, but you were afraid we
were going to send you away. In addition to your wages223
we have promised to give you a large sum of money at
the end of your time here—and now you want to leave
us, at once! Come now, you must have some sort of reason.
Has anyone been doing anything to you?

NURSE. No, sir.

GEORGE. Well then?

NURSE. I’ve been thinking.

GEORGE [exasperated] Don’t go on repeating that silly
thing! What do you mean by it? [Gently] Come, come,
tell me why you want to go away. [Silence] Eh?

NURSE. I have told you.

GEORGE. One might as well talk to a block of wood.

MME. DUPONT [coming forward] But you have no right
to leave us.

NURSE. Yes, I want to go away.

MME. DUPONT. I shall not allow you to go!

GEORGE. Oh well, let her go; after all we can’t keep her
by force. [To the nurse] Since you want to go, you shall
go: but I can only say that you’re as stupid as a cow.

NURSE. I don’t mind if I am.

GEORGE. I shall not pay you for the month that has
just begun, and you will pay for your own railway ticket.

NURSE. We’ll see about that.

GEORGE. Yes, you will see. You’ll see this moment,
too! Be off with you, I don’t want you any longer. Now
then!

MME. DUPONT. Don’t fly into a rage, George. [To the
nurse] You don’t mean it seriously, nurse, surely?

NURSE. I would rather go back home at once and only
have my five hundred francs.

GEORGE. What’s that?

MME. DUPONT. What are you talking about?

GEORGE. Five hundred francs?

MME. DUPONT. What five hundred francs?

NURSE. The five hundred francs you promised me, to
be sure!

GEORGE. We never promised you anything of the sort!

224

NURSE. Yes, you did.

MME. DUPONT. Yes, when you had finished nursing the
baby and if we were satisfied with you.

NURSE. No, you said you would give me five hundred
francs when I left. Now I’m going away, so I want them.

MME. DUPONT. You will please not address me in that
tone, you understand.

NURSE. You’ve only got to give me my money and I
shan’t say a word more.

GEORGE. Oh, that’s it, is it? Very well, I discharge you
on the spot. Now, then, be off with you.

MME. DUPONT. I should think so, indeed.

GEORGE. Off you go!

NURSE. Give me my five hundred francs.

GEORGE [pointing furiously at the door] Take your
blasted carcase out of this. Do you hear?

NURSE. Hullo, hullo! You speak to me a bit more politely,
can’t you?

GEORGE. Will you get out of this, or have I got to send
for the police?

NURSE. The police! What for, eh, what for?

GEORGE. To chuck you out, you—

NURSE. Well, and what am I? I’m only a country girl,
I am. I may be a bit stupid—

MME. DUPONT. Stupid! I should think you were. You
have no more brains than a mule.

NURSE. I may be stupid, but I’m not—

MME. DUPONT [interrupting] You have no more heart
than a stone. You are a wicked woman.

GEORGE. You’re no better than a thief.

NURSE. Oh, a thief am I? I should like to know why.

GEORGE. Because you’re trying to get money that isn’t
yours.

MME. DUPONT. Because you are deserting our baby.
You are a wicked woman.

GEORGE. Do you want me to put you out? [He takes
her by the arm].

225

NURSE. Oh, that’s it, is it? So you want me to tell you
why I’m going?

GEORGE. Now then, out with it.

MME. DUPONT. Well, why is it?

Henriette enters at the back. In the noise of the quarrel
no one perceives her.

NURSE. Very well, then. I’m going away because I don’t
want to catch your beastly diseases here.

MME. DUPONT. Be quiet, will you?

GEORGE. Shut up, can’t you?

NURSE. Oh, you needn’t be afraid; everyone knows
about it. Justin listened at the door to what your doctor
was saying and told me what was up. Oh, I may be stupid,
but I’m not so stupid as that. I’m going to have my
money and get out of this.

GEORGE. Shut up!

MME. DUPONT [taking her by the arm] Hold your tongue,
I tell you.

NURSE. Let me go! Let me go! I know your brat’s not
going to live. I know it’s rotten through and through because
its father’s got a beastly disease that he caught from
some woman of the streets.

Henriette, with two hoarse cries, falls to the ground in a
fit of nervous sobbing.

GEORGE [rushing towards her] My God!

Henriette eludes him and pulls herself up with disgust,
hatred, and horror depicted all over her.

HENRIETTE [shrieking like a mad woman] Don’t touch
me! Don’t touch me!

226

ACT III

The doctor’s room in the hospital where he is chief physician.
The doctor enters with a medical student, both in
their hospital clothes, and takes off his apron while talking.

DOCTOR. By the way, my dear fellow, is the gentleman
we passed in the passage waiting for you?

STUDENT. No, not for me.

DOCTOR. Then it’s my deputy. Do you know this name?
Where did I put his card? [He looks on his desk] Ah,
here. ‘Loches, deputy for Sarthes’?

STUDENT. That’s the famous Loches.

DOCTOR. Ah, yes, deputy for Sarthes. A regular orator,
isn’t he?

STUDENT. Tremendous, I believe.

DOCTOR. That’s the man we want then. He busies himself
a great deal with social questions?

STUDENT. Just so.

DOCTOR. I suppose he wants to start an agitation in the
Chamber in favor of the laws for which we have been
clamoring so long. No doubt he means to post himself up
first. This is what he writes: ‘Loches, deputy for Sarthes,
presents his compliments’ etc.... would be much obliged
if I would see him to-morrow, Sunday: not for a
consultation.

STUDENT. It’s very likely he has some idea of the sort.

DOCTOR. Now that I have a deputy I will post him up,227
I can assure you. That’s why I have had the case from St.
Charles’ ward and number 28 brought here.

STUDENT. Shall you want me?

DOCTOR. Not at all, my dear fellow. Good-bye.

STUDENT. Good-bye, sir.

DOCTOR [calling to the other as he goes out] Would you
mind telling them to show in M. Loches? Thanks very
much. Good-bye.

The student goes out.

Loches enters and bows. The doctor motions him to be
seated.

LOCHES. I must thank you for being so kind as to receive
me out of your regular hours. The business that
brings me here is peculiarly distressing. I am the father-in-law
of M. George Dupont. After the terrible revelation
of yesterday, my daughter has returned to me with her
child and I have come to ask you to be so good as to continue
attending on the infant, but at my house.

DOCTOR. Very good.

LOCHES. Thank you. Now, as to the scoundrel who is
the cause of all these misfortunes.

DOCTOR [very gently] You must excuse me, but that
is a subject on which I cannot enter. My functions are
only those of a physician.

LOCHES [in a thick voice] I ask your pardon, but I
think when you have heard me for a moment, you will
agree with me. I shall not trouble you with the plans of
vengeance I formed yesterday, when my poor daughter
fled to me with her child in her arms after the revelation
that you know. You will excuse me if I speak to you in
this state—oh, I can scarcely contain my indignation! I
had intended to talk of this calmly: but when I think of
that man and of his infamous conduct—the brutal, cowardly
blow he has struck at me and mine—I cannot control
myself—I, I—. It is abominable! My daughter! A
girl of twenty-two! Twenty-two!

A silence.

228

DOCTOR. I understand and respect your feelings; but,
believe me, you are not in a fit state to form any decision
at this moment.

LOCHES [with an effort] Yes, yes: I will command myself.
All last night I spent in profound reflection, and after
rejecting the ideas I mentioned, this is the conclusion to
which I have come in conjunction with my daughter: we
desire to obtain a divorce as soon as possible. Consequently
I have come to ask you for the certificate which
will be the basis of our action.

DOCTOR. What certificate?

LOCHES. A certificate attesting the nature of the disease
which this man has contracted.

DOCTOR. I regret that I am unable to furnish you with
such a certificate.

LOCHES. How is that?

DOCTOR. The rule of professional secrecy is absolute.

LOCHES. It is impossible that it should be your duty to
take sides with a criminal against his innocent victims.

DOCTOR. To avoid all discussion, I may add that even
were I free, I should refuse your request.

LOCHES. May I ask why?

DOCTOR. I should regret having helped you to obtain a
divorce.

LOCHES. Then just because you hold this or that theory,
because your profession has rendered you sceptical or insensible
to the sight of misery like ours, my daughter must
bear this man’s name to the end of her life!

DOCTOR. It would be in your daughter’s own interest
that I should refuse.

LOCHES. Indeed! You have a strange conception of her
interest.

DOCTOR [very gently] In your present state of excitement
you will probably begin to abuse me before five
minutes are over. That will not disturb a man of my experience,
but you see why I refused to discuss these subjects.
However, since I have let myself in for it, I may as229
well explain my position. You ask me for a certificate in
order to prove to the court that your son-in-law has contracted
syphilis?

LOCHES. Yes.

DOCTOR. You do not consider that in doing so you will
publicly acknowledge that your daughter has been exposed
to the infection. The statement will be officially
registered in the papers of the case. Do you suppose that
after that your daughter is likely to find a second husband?

LOCHES. She will never marry again.

DOCTOR. She says so now. Can you be sure that she
will say so in five or in ten years time? Besides, you will
not obtain a divorce, because I shall not furnish you with
the necessary proof.

LOCHES. I shall find other ways to establish it. I shall
have the child examined by another doctor.

DOCTOR. Indeed! You think that this poor little thing
has not been unlucky enough in her start in life? She has
been blighted physically: you wish besides to stamp her
indelibly with the legal proof of congenital syphilis?

LOCHES. So when the victims seek to defend themselves
they are struck still lower! So the law provides no arms
against the man who takes an innocent, confiding young
girl in sound health, knowingly befouls her with the heritage
of his debauchery, and makes her mother of a
wretched mite whose future is such that those who love
it most do not know whether they had better pray for its
life or for its immediate deliverance! This man has inflicted
on his wife the supreme insult, the most odious
degradation. He has, as it were, thrust her into contact
with the streetwalker with whose vice he is stained, and
created between her and that common thing a bond of
blood to poison herself and her child. Thanks to him, this
abject creature, this prostitute, lives our life, makes one
of our family, sits down with us at table. He has smirched
my daughter’s imagination as he has tarnished her body,
and bound up for ever in her mind the ideal of love that230
she placed so high with heaven knows what horrors of
the hospital. He has struck her physically and morally,
in her dignity and her modesty, in her love and in her
child. He has hurled her into the depths of shame. And
the state of law and opinion is such that this woman cannot
be separated from this man save at the cost of a scandal
which will overwhelm herself and her child. Very well,
then, I shall not ask the aid of the law. Last night I wondered
if it was not my duty to go and shoot down that
brute like a mad dog. It was cowardice that prevented
me. Weakly I proposed to invoke the law. Well, since the
law will not do justice, I will take it into my own hands.
Perhaps his death will serve as a warning to others.

DOCTOR [putting aside his hat] You will be tried for
your life.

LOCHES. And I shall be acquitted.

DOCTOR. Yes; but after the public narration of all your
troubles. The scandal and the misfortune will be so much
the greater, that is all. And how do you know that the day
after your acquittal you will not find yourself before another
and less lenient judge? When your daughter, realizing
that you have rendered her unhappiness irreparable,
and seized with pity for your victim, demands by what
right you have killed the father of her child, what will you
say? What will you say when that child one day asks the
same question?

LOCHES [speaking before the other has done] Then what
can I do?

DOCTOR [immediately] Forgive.

A silence.

LOCHES [without energy] Never.

DOCTOR. Are you quite sure that you have the right to
be so inflexible? Was it not within your power at a certain
moment to spare your daughter the possibility of this
misery?

LOCHES. Within my power! Do you imply that I am
responsible?

231

DOCTOR. Yes; I do. When the marriage was proposed
you doubtless made enquiries concerning your future son-in-law’s
income; you investigated his securities; you satisfied
yourself as to his character. You only omitted one
point, but it was the most important of all: you made no
enquiries concerning his health.

LOCHES. No.

DOCTOR. And why?

LOCHES. Because it is not the custom.

DOCTOR. Well, it ought to be made the custom. Before
giving his daughter in marriage a father ought to
take as much care with regard to her husband as a house
of business takes in engaging an employee.

LOCHES. You are right, a law should be passed.

DOCTOR. No, no. We want no new laws: there are too
many already. All that is needed is for people to understand
the nature of this disease rather better. It would
soon become the custom for a man who proposed for a
girl’s hand to add to the other things for which he is asked
a medical statement of bodily fitness, which would make
it certain that he did not bring this plague into the family
with him. It would be perfectly simple. Once it was the
custom, the man would go to his doctor for a certificate
of health before he could sign the register, just as now,
before he can be married in church, he goes to his priest
for a certificate that he has confessed. As things are, before
a marriage is concluded the family lawyers meet to
discuss matters: a meeting between the two doctors would
be at least as useful and would prevent many misfortunes.
Your enquiry, you see, was incomplete. Your daughter
might well ask you, who are a man and a father, and ought
to know these things, why you did not take as much trouble
about her health as about her fortune. I tell you that
you must forgive.

LOCHES. Never.

DOCTOR. Well: there is one last argument which, since
I must, I will put to you. Are you yourself without sin,232
that you are so relentless to others?

LOCHES. I have never had any shameful disease, sir!

DOCTOR. I was not asking you that. I was asking you if
you had never exposed yourself to catching one. [He pauses.
Loches does not reply] Ah, you see! Then it is not
virtue that has saved you: it is luck. Few things exasperate
me more than that term ‘shameful disease,’ which you
used just now. This disease is like all other diseases: it is
one of our afflictions. There is no shame in being wretched—even
if one deserves to be so. [Hotly] Come, come: let
us have a little plain speaking! I should like to know how
many of these rigid moralists, who are so choked with
their middle-class prudery that they dare not mention
the name syphilis, or when they bring themselves to
speak of it do so with expressions of every sort of disgust,
and treat its victims as criminals, have never run the risk
of contracting it themselves. It is those alone who have
the right to talk. How many do you think there are?
Four out of a thousand? Well, leave those four aside; between
all the rest and those who catch the disease there is
no difference but chance. [Bursting out] And by heavens,
those who escape won’t get much sympathy from
me: the others at least have paid their fine of suffering
and remorse, while they have gone scot-free! [Recovering
himself] Let’s have done, if you please, once for all
with this sort of hypocrisy. Your son-in-law, like yourself
and like the immense majority of men, has had mistresses
before he married. He has had the ill-luck to catch
syphilis, and married supposing that the disease was no
longer dangerous when in fact it still was. It is a misfortune
that we must do our best to remedy, and not to aggravate.
Perhaps in your youth you deserved what he
has got even more than he; at any rate your position towards
him is as that of the culprit who has escaped punishment
towards his less fortunate comrade. That is a reflection
that should, I think, touch you.

LOCHES. You put it in such a way—

233

DOCTOR. Am I not right?

LOCHES. Perhaps: but I can’t tell my daughter all this
to persuade her to return to her husband.

DOCTOR. There are other arguments that you can use.

LOCHES. What, then, good heavens?

DOCTOR. Any number. You can tell her that a separation
will be a calamity for all parties and that her husband
is the only person interested in helping her at any price
to save her child. You can tell her that out of the ruins of
her first happiness she can construct a life of solid affection
that will have every chance of being lasting and most
sincerely enviable. There is much truth in the saying that
reformed rakes make the best husbands. Take your son-in-law.
If your daughter consents to forgive and forget,
he will not only respect her; he will be eternally grateful.
You can tell her all this and you will find much else
to say besides. As for the future, we will make sure that
when they are re-united their next child shall be healthy
and vigorous.

LOCHES. Is that possible?

DOCTOR. Yes, yes! A thousand times yes. I have one
thing that I always tell my patients: if I could I would
paste it up at every street corner. ‘Syphilis is like a woman
whose temper is roused by the feeling that her
power is disdained. It is terrible only to those who think
it insignificant, not to those who know its dangers.’ Repeat
that to your daughter. Give her back to her husband—she
has nothing more to fear from him—and in two
years time I guarantee that you will be a happy grand-father.

LOCHES. Thank you, doctor. I do not know if I can ever
forget. But you have made me so uneasy on the score of
these responsibilities that I have ignored and given me
back so much hope, that I will promise you to do nothing
rash. If my poor child can, after a time bring herself to
forgive her husband, I shall not stand in the way.

DOCTOR. Good! But if you have another daughter, take234
care not to make the same mistake that you made over
the marriage of your first.

LOCHES. How was I to know?

DOCTOR. Ah, there it is. You didn’t know! You are a
father and you didn’t know! You are a deputy and have
the honor and the burden of making laws for us, and you
didn’t know! You didn’t know about syphilis, just as you
probably do not know about alcoholism and tuberculosis.

LOCHES. Really, I—

DOCTOR. Well, if you like I will except you. But there
are five hundred others, are there not, who sit in the
Chamber and style themselves Representatives of the people?
Here are the three unspeakable gods to whom every
day thousands of human sacrifices are offered up. What
single hour do your colleagues find for the organization
of our forces against these insatiable monsters? Take alcoholism.
The manufacture of poisonous liquors should
be prohibited and the number of licences cut down. But
we are afraid of the power of the great distillers and of the
voting strength of the trade: consequently we deplore
the immorality of the working classes and quiet our conscience
by writing pamphlets and preaching sermons.
Pah! Then take tuberculosis: everyone knows that the
real remedy is to pay sufficient wages and have insanitary
workmen’s dwellings knocked down. But no one will do
it, although the working class is the most useful we have
as well as the worst rewarded. Instead, workmen are recommended
not to spit. Admirable, isn’t it? Finally, syphilis.
Why do you not concern yourselves with that?
You create offices of state for all sorts of things: why do
you not one day set about creating an office of public
health?

LOCHES. My dear doctor, you are falling into the common
French mistake of attributing all the ills in the world
to the government. In this case it is for you to shew us
the way. These are matters for scientific experts. You
must begin by pointing out the necessary measures, and235
then—

DOCTOR. And then,—what? Ha! It is fifteen years
since a scheme of this kind, worked out and approved
unanimously by the Academy of Medicine, was submitted
to the proper authorities. Since that day it has never been
heard of again.

LOCHES. Then you think that there really are measures
to be taken?

DOCTOR. You shall answer that question yourself. I
must tell you that when I received your card yesterday I
imagined that it was in your public capacity that you were
about to interest yourself in these matters. Consequently,
after naming the hour of your visit, I told off two of my
hospital patients to show to you. You need not be alarmed,
I shall not shock your nerves. To outward appearance
they have nothing the matter with them. They are not
bad cases; they are simply the damaged goods of our great
human cargo. I merely wished to give you food for reflection,
not a lesson in pathology. You came on another
matter. So much the worse for you. I have you and I shall
not let you go. [A slight pause]. I will ask you, therefore,
to raise your mind above your personal sorrow and
to conceive in the mass the thousands of beings who suffer
from similar causes. Thousands, mark you, from every
rank of society. The disease jumps from the hovel into
the home, frequently with few intermediate steps; so that
to cleanse the gutter, where preventive measures can be
taken, means practically to safeguard the family life. Our
greatest enemy of all, as you shall see for yourself, is ignorance.
Ignorance, I repeat. The refrain is always the
same: ‘I didn’t know.’ Patients, whom we might have
saved had they come in time, come too late, in a desperate
condition, and after having spread the evil far and wide.
And why? ‘I didn’t know.’ [Going towards the door]
What can we do? We can’t hunt them out from the highways
and hedges. [To a woman in the passage] Come in,
please. [The woman enters. She is of the working class.236
The doctor turns again to Loches] Here is a case. This
woman is very seriously ill. I have told her so, and I told
her to come here once a week. [To the woman] Is that so?

WOMAN. Yes, sir.

DOCTOR [angrily] And how long is it since you came
last?

WOMAN. Three months.

DOCTOR. Three months! How do you suppose I can cure
you like that? It is hopeless, do you hear, hopeless! Well,
why didn’t you come? Don’t you know that you have a
very serious disease?

WOMAN. Oh yes, sir. I know it is. My husband died of it.

DOCTOR [more gently] Your husband died of it?

WOMAN. Yes, sir.

DOCTOR. Did he not go to the doctor?

WOMAN. No, sir.

DOCTOR. And isn’t that a warning to you?

WOMAN. Oh sir, I’d come as often as you told me to, only
I can’t afford it.

DOCTOR. How do you mean, you can’t afford it?

LOCHES. The consultations are gratis, are they not?

WOMAN. Yes, sir. But they’re during working hours,
and then, it’s a long way to come. One has to wait one’s
turn with all the others and sometimes it takes the best
part of the day, and I’m afraid of losing my place if I stop
away so much. So I wait till I can’t help coming again.
And then—

DOCTOR. Well?

WOMAN. Oh, it’s nothing, sir. You’re too kind to me.

DOCTOR. Go on, go on.

WOMAN. I know I oughtn’t to mind, but I haven’t always
been so poor. We were well off before my husband
fell ill, and I’ve always lived by my own work. It’s not as
it is for a woman who hasn’t any self-respect. I know it’s
wrong, but having to wait like that with everyone else and
to tell all about myself before everyone—I know I’m
wrong, but it’s hard all the same, it’s very hard.

237

DOCTOR. Poor woman. [A pause. Then very gently]
So it was from your husband that you caught this disease?

WOMAN. Yes, sir. We used to live in the country and
then my husband caught it and went half mad. He didn’t
know what he was doing, and used to order all kinds of
things we couldn’t pay for.

DOCTOR. Why did he not get himself looked after?

WOMAN. He didn’t know. We were sold up and came
to Paris: we hadn’t any more money. Then he went to
the hospital.

DOCTOR. Well?

WOMAN. He got looked after there, but they wouldn’t
give him any medicines.

DOCTOR. How was that?

WOMAN. Because we had only been three months in
Paris. They only give you the medicines free if you have
lived here six months.

LOCHES. Is that so?

DOCTOR. Yes, that is the rule.

WOMAN. You see it isn’t our fault.

DOCTOR. You have no children, have you?

WOMAN. I couldn’t ever bring one to birth, sir. My
husband was taken at the very beginning of our marriage,
while he was doing his time as a reservist. There are women
that hang about the barracks.

A silence.

DOCTOR. Ah! Well, this is my private address; you
come to see me there every Sunday morning. [At the door
he slips a piece of money into her hand. Roughly] There,
just take that and run along. What’s that? Tut, tut! Nonsense!
Nonsense! I haven’t time to listen to you. Run
along, now. [He pushes her out. To someone who is invisible
to the audience] What can I do for you?

MAN [outside] I am the father of the young man you
saw this morning. I asked leave to speak to you after the
consultation was over.

DOCTOR. Ah yes, just so, I recognize you. Your son is at238
college, isn’t he?

MAN [in the doorway] Yes, sir.

DOCTOR. Come in, come in. You can talk before this
gentleman.

MAN [entering] You know, sir, the disaster that has befallen
us. My son is eighteen; as the result of this disease
he is half paralyzed. We are small tradespeople; we have
regularly bled ourselves in order to send him to college,
and now—! I only wish the same thing mayn’t happen
to others. It was at the very college gates that my poor
boy was got hold of by one of these women. Is it right,
sir, that that should be allowed? Aren’t there enough
police to prevent children of fifteen from being seduced
like that? I ask, is it right?

DOCTOR. No.

MAN. Why don’t they stop it, then?

DOCTOR. I don’t know.

MAN. Look at my son. He’d be better in his grave. He
was such a fine, good looking chap. We were that proud
of him.

DOCTOR. Never despair. We’ll do our best to cure him.
[Sadly] But why did you wait so long before bringing
him to me?

MAN. How was I to know what he had? He was afraid
to tell me, so he let the thing go on. Then when he felt
he was really bad with it, he went, without letting me
know, to quacks, who robbed him without curing him.
Ah, that, too, is that right? What’s the government
about that it allows that? Isn’t that more important than
what they spend their time over?

DOCTOR. You are right. Their only excuse is that they
do not know. You must take courage. We have cured
worse cases than your son’s. As for the others, perhaps
some day they will have a little attention paid them.
[He goes with the man to the door. Turning to Loches]
You see, the true remedy lies in a change of our ways.
Syphilis must cease to be treated like a mysterious evil239
the very name of which cannot be pronounced. The ignorance
in which the public is kept of the real nature and
of the consequences of this disease helps to aggravate and
to spread it. Generally it is contracted because ‘I didn’t
know’; it becomes dangerous for want of proper care because
’I didn’t know’; it is passed on from person to person
because ‘I didn’t know.’ People ought to know.
Young men ought to be taught the responsibilities they
assume and the misfortunes they may bring on themselves.

LOCHES. At the same time these things cannot be
taught to children at school.

DOCTOR. Why not, pray?

LOCHES. There are curiosities which it would be imprudent
to arouse.

DOCTOR [hotly] So you think that by ignoring those
curiosities you stifle them? Why, every boy and girl who
who has been to a boarding school or through college
knows you do not! So far from stifling them, you drive
them to satisfy themselves in secret by any vile means they
can. There is nothing immoral in the act that reproduces
life by the means of love. But for the benefit of our children
we organize round about it a gigantic conspiracy of
silence. A respectable man will take his son and daughter
to one of these grand music halls, where they will hear
things of the most loathsome description; but he won’t
let them hear a word spoken seriously on the subject of
the great act of love. No, no! Not a word about that
without blushing: only, as many barrack room jokes, as
many of the foulest music hall suggestions as you like!
Pornography, as much as you please: science, never!
That is what we ought to change. The mystery and humbug
in which physical facts are enveloped ought to be
swept away and young men be given some pride in the
creative power with which each one of us is endowed.
They ought to be made to understand that the future of
the race is in their hands and to be taught to transmit the240
great heritage they have received from their ancestors intact
with all its possibilities to their descendants.

LOCHES. Ah, but we should go beyond that! I realize
now that what is needed is to attack this evil at its source
and to suppress prostitution. We ought to hound out
these vile women who poison the very life of society.

DOCTOR. You forget that they themselves have first
been poisoned. I am going to show you one of them. I
warn you, not that it matters much, that she won’t express
herself like a duchess. I can make her talk by playing on
her vanity; she wants to be a ballet-dancer.

He opens the door and admits a pretty girl of some twenty
years: she is very gay and cheerful.

DOCTOR. Getting on all right? [Without waiting for an
answer] You still want to go on the stage, don’t you?

GIRL. Rather.

DOCTOR. Well, this gentleman’s a friend of the manager
of the opera. He can give you a line to him, will that
do?

GIRL. Why, of course. But if they want a character, I’m
done, you know.

DOCTOR. They won’t. You just tell the gentleman about
yourself, what you want to do and what you’ve done.
Talk to him a bit.

GIRL. My parents were people of good position. They
sent me to a boarding school—

DOCTOR [interrupting] You needn’t tell him all that;
he won’t believe a word of it.

GIRL. Eh? Well, but if I tell him the truth, it’s all up
with me.

DOCTOR. No, no; he won’t mind. Now then, you came
to Paris—

GIRL. Yes.

DOCTOR. You got a place as maid-servant?

GIRL. Well, yes.

DOCTOR. How old were you then?

GIRL. Why, I was turned seventeen.

241

DOCTOR. And then you had a baby?

GIRL [astonished at the question] Of course I did, next
year.

DOCTOR. Well, who was its father?

GIRL [treating it as a matter of course] Why, it was
my master, of course.

DOCTOR. Go on, go on. Tell us about it. Your mistress
found out. What happened then?

GIRL [in the same tone] She sent me packing. I’d have
done the same, if I’d been her.

DOCTOR. Go on, what are you stopping for? Talk away.
The gentleman’s from the country; he doesn’t understand
about these things.

GIRL [gaily] Right oh! I’ll tell you all about it. One
night the boss comes up to my room in his socks and says:
’If you shriek out, off you go!’ Then—

DOCTOR. No, no. Begin after you lost your place.

GIRL. All right, if you think he’ll think it funny.

DOCTOR. Never mind that. Say what you’re doing now.

GIRL. Why, I come here every day.

DOCTOR. But before you come here?

GIRL. Oh, I do my five hours on the streets.

DOCTOR. Well, how’s that? The gentleman’s from the
country, I tell you. He wants to know. Go on.

GIRL. There now, I wouldn’t have thought there was
anyone didn’t know that. Why, I rig myself out as a work-girl,
with a little bag on my arm—they make togs special
for that, y’ know—and then I trot along by the shop windows.
Pretty hard work, too, ‘cause to do it real well you
have to walk fast. Then I stops in front of some shop or
other. Nine times out of ten that does the trick. It just
makes me laugh, I tell you, but you’d think all the men
had learnt what to say out of a book. There’s only two
things they say, that’s all. It’s either: ‘You walk very
fast’ or else: ‘Aren’t you afraid, all alone?’ One knows
what that means, eh? Or else I do the ‘young widow’
fake. You’ve got to go a bit fast like that, too. I don’t know242
why, but it makes ’em catch on. They find out precious
soon I’m not a young widow, but that doesn’t make any
odds. [Seriously] There’re things like that I don’t understand.

DOCTOR. What sort are they, then? Shopwalkers, commercial
travellers?

GIRL. I like that! Why, I only take real gentlemen.

DOCTOR. They say that’s what they are.

GIRL. Oh, I can see well enough. Besides, a whole lot
of ’em have orders on. That makes me laugh, too. When
they meet you, they’ve got their little bits of ribbon stuck
in their buttonhole. Then they follow you and they
haven’t anything. I wanted to find out, so I looked over
my shoulder in a glass and saw my man snap the ribbon
out with his finger and thumb just as you do when you’re
shelling peas. You know?

DOCTOR. Yes, I know. Tell us about your child. What
became of it?

GIRL. Oh, I left it at that place in the Rue Denfer.

DOCTOR [to Loches] The foundlings’ hospital.

LOCHES. Did you not mind doing that?

GIRL. It was better than dragging it about with me to
starve.

LOCHES. Still, it was your child.

GIRL. Well, what about its father? It was his child, too,
wasn’t it? See here, I’m not going to talk about that again.
Anyway, just tell me what I could have done, you two
there. Put it out to nurse? Well, of course, I would have,
if I’d been sure of having the money for it. But then I
wanted to get another place; and how was I to pay for
nursing it with the twentyfive or thirty francs a month I
should have got, eh? If I wanted to keep straight, I
couldn’t keep the kid. See?

LOCHES. It’s too horrible.

The doctor stops him with a gesture.

GIRL [angrily] It’s just as I tell you. What else could
I have done, eh? If you’d been in my place you’d have243
done just the same. [Quieting down] See here, what’s
the good of making a fuss about it? You’ll say: ‘But
you haven’t been living straight.’ No more I have, but
how could I help it? I couldn’t stay in my places; and
then, when you’re hungry and a jolly young chap offers
you a dinner, my word, I’d like to see the girl who’d say
no. I never learnt any trade, you see. So that the end of
it all is that I found myself in St. Lazare because I was ill.
That’s pretty low down, too. These beastly men give you
their foul diseases and it’s me they stick in prison. It’s a
bit thick, that is.

DOCTOR. You gave them as good as you got, didn’t you,
though?

GIRL [gaily] Oh, I had my tit for tat! [To Loches] I
suppose you’d like to have that too? Before they carted
me off there, the day I found out I was in for it, I was going
home in a pretty temper when who do you think I
met in the street but my old boss! I was that glad to see
him! Now, thinks I to myself, you’re going to pay me
what you owe me—with interest too! I just winked at
him: oh, it didn’t take long, I can tell you. [Tragically]
Then when I left him, I don’t know what came over me—I
felt half mad. I took on everyone I could, for anything
or for nothing! As many as I could, all the youngest and
the best looking—well, I only gave ’em back what they
gave me! Now somehow I don’t care any more: where’s
the use in pulling long faces about things? It only makes
me laugh. Other women, they do just the same; but then
they do it for their bread and butter, d’you see. A girl
must live even if she is ill, eh? [A pause] Well, you’ll give
my name to the chap at the theatre, won’t you? The doc
here’ll tell you my address.

LOCHES. I promise you I will.

GIRL. Thank ye, sir.

She goes out.

DOCTOR. Was I not right to keep that confession for
the end? This poor girl is typical. The whole problem is244
summed up in her: she is at once the product and the
cause. We set the ball rolling, others keep it up, and it
runs back to bruise our own shins. I have nothing more
to say. [He shakes hands with Loches as he conducts him
to the door, and adds in a lighter tone] But if you give a
thought or two to what you have just seen when you are
sitting in the Chamber, we shall not have wasted our time.

Maternity

[New Version]

Translated by John Pollock

248

A second version of Maternity was lately
undertaken by M. Brieux. It differs in so many
respects from the original one performed in
England by the Stage Society, that it has been
decided to include both versions in this volume.
That which follows is the later one, and is presented
by its author as the final form of the play.

249

ACT I

Brignac’s drawing room. An octagonal room, five sides
of which are visible. Right, the door of Brignac’s study,
and beyond it the mantelpiece, in front of which are armchairs
and a marquetry table with seats round it. At the
back the door of the bedroom, which, being opened, shews the
bed. Left, the door into the hall, then that of Annette’s room,
and beyond, a large window with a piano and music stool in
front of it. In the corners at the back, on both sides, flowers
in stands. The room is pretty and comfortable, without being
luxurious. At the rise of the curtain the stage is empty.
The door, left, opens, and Josephine, the maid, shews in
Madeleine, a woman of twentyeight.

JOSEPHINE. Madame Brignac must be there. I’ll tell
her.

She goes across to the door at the back and disappears.
After a moment Lucie enters. She is twentyfive years old,
and her simple, but becoming, dress contrasts with her elder
sister’s exquisite and fashionable appearance.

LUCIE [going gaily to Madeleine and kissing her] My
dear, how are you?

MADELEINE. Lucie, sweet!

LUCIE. How ravishing you look!

MADELEINE. One must, to please one’s husband. Tell
me—but first, how are the children?

LUCIE. About as usual.

250

MADELEINE. I’ve a piece of good news. You know Dr.
Hourtin?

LUCIE. No, no; I don’t think so.

MADELEINE. Yes; you do. The famous Hourtin, you
know. The man they call Providence for nervous diseases.

LUCIE. Oh yes, yes.

MADELEINE. Dr. Bar wanted to have a consultation
with him about your children, didn’t he?

LUCIE. Of course; I know.

MADELEINE. I’ve just met him at the Parmillets’.

LUCIE. What, he’s at Chartres!

MADELEINE. He’s going to see his brother somewhere
or other not far off, and so he came through Chartres to
visit the wonderful cave. In the one week since they found
it he must be at least the twentieth man of science to come
and pore over these old prehistoric bones.

LUCIE. But I thought he was a specialist for—

MADELEINE. Yes; the skeletons are just a relaxation.

LUCIE. Oh! Well—

MADELEINE. He’s a great friend of the Parmillets. So
as I had the chance, I asked him to come here, and he said
he would.

LUCIE. But the children are with their granny in the
country.

MADELEINE. Oh, dear. Couldn’t you send for them?

LUCIE. Yes, certainly. But when is Dr. Hourtin going?

MADELEINE. At five o’clock. He wanted to go to his
brother first.

LUCIE. There’d hardly be time.

MADELEINE. No. Suppose we were to ask him to come
this evening on his way back?

LUCIE. Do you think he would?

MADELEINE. Oh, yes; he’s a charming man.

LUCIE. What a piece of luck! If he could only cure my
poor babies!

MADELEINE. They say he works wonders. And where
is our little Annette?

251

LUCIE. Annette is with the Bernins. Tuesday is her
day for going there.

MADELEINE. And your husband?

LUCIE. My husband? Why, he’s at his meeting, of
course.

MADELEINE. What, is it this afternoon?

LUCIE. You naughty woman! Not even to know the
date of your brother in-law’s meeting!

MADELEINE [making a face] No. To me, you know, all
these questions—birth-rate, repopulation—ugh!

LUCIE. France has need of it.

MADELEINE. I suppose so. [A pause] How is it you’re
not at the meeting?

LUCIE. It’s only for working-men.

MADELEINE. M. de Forgeau’s constituents?

LUCIE. Yes, but some day they may be Julien’s constituents.

MADELEINE. How do you mean?

LUCIE. Listen. It’s a secret, but I can’t help telling you.
M. de Forgeau has promised Julien to get him adopted by
his committee at the election to the Chamber two months
from now.

MADELEINE. Do you find the idea of being wife of a
deputy fascinating?

LUCIE [laughing] He didn’t ask my opinion. [Seriously]
It seems that if he were in the Chamber, Julien
might look forward to going very far.

MADELEINE. It was he who said that?

LUCIE. He, and M. de Forgeau. You know we’re not
rich. My husband’s professional income would hardly be
enough to secure the future of our two little girls, even if
one were not, alas, an invalid.

MADELEINE. Aren’t you afraid that Julien may be once
again letting his imagination run away with him?

LUCIE [melancholy] What would be the good of my
trying to dissuade him? I must make myself try to share
his illusions—for instance, in the success of his meeting252
this afternoon.

MADELEINE. But what can he find to say to working-men
about all that? That they ought to have large families?

LUCIE. That’s it.

MADELEINE. Of course, I know nothing about it, but I
should think the best way to encourage them was not to
let the children they have already perish of want.

LUCIE. Just what I tell Julien. It’s the rich who ought
to have children.

MADELEINE. So I think.

LUCIE. You’re rich—why have you only got one, then?

MADELEINE. That’s another question. Don’t let’s talk
about that. Talk of something cheery.

JOSEPHINE [entering] If you please, ma’am, Catherine
is here.

LUCIE. Ask her to come in. [To Madeleine] It’s ever
so long since I’ve seen nursie.

Josephine shews in Catherine, a working-woman of forty,
dressed simply and very neatly in a black cloak and bonnet.

CATHERINE [to Lucie and Madeleine] Good-day,
ma’am. Good-day.

LUCIE and MADELEINE [shaking hands] How do you do,
Catherine?

CATHERINE. And your sister, ma’am, how’s she?

LUCIE. Annette? Your darling’s very well.

CATHERINE. That’s good to hear. I thought I’d just look
in to say good-day.

LUCIE. I’m glad you came.

CATHERINE. And to ask if you haven’t any errands for
me in Paris.

MADELEINE [teasing her good humouredly] Ah! So
Catherine’s off to Paris—quite the lady!

LUCIE. Shall you stay there long?

CATHERINE. Oh, no. I expect to be back to-morrow. My
big boy there isn’t very well. So I’m going to see him, too.

MADELEINE [in order to say something] This early heat,
no doubt.

253

CATHERINE. May be. Then you haven’t any errands for
me?

LUCIE and MADELEINE. No, no. No, thank you.

CATHERINE. You don’t know what I’m going for?

LUCIE. I have no idea.

CATHERINE. I’m going to see my eldest girl.

MADELEINE. You know where she’s living, then?

CATHERINE. Yes, I’ve seen someone who met her.

LUCIE. And why didn’t she write to you?

CATHERINE. We’d got angry with one another.

MADELEINE. Ah!

CATHERINE. After she was turned off from the sewing-place
she couldn’t get any work. And what must she do
but want money from me? As if we had so much to spare!

LUCIE. What’s she doing now?

CATHERINE. She’s in work again. It seems she’s got a
good place.

LUCIE. Come and tell us about her, won’t you?

CATHERINE. Yes, indeed I will.

MADELEINE. And when you’re my way come in to see
me, too. I’ll have a little packet of things for your youngsters.

CATHERINE. Ah, there it is! My husband won’t let me
take anything more from you or Mme. Brignac.

LUCIE. Why?

CATHERINE. Because of his politics. He says he’s not
going to vote for M. Brignac, so he doesn’t want to owe
him anything.

MADELEINE. But why not from me? I don’t ask him to
vote for me!

CATHERINE. That’s all one. You see, when you’re in
want, it turns a body sulky.

LUCIE. In want? He’s still at the electric works, isn’t
he? He makes a good living.

CATHERINE. So he does. If there were just the two of
us, we’d live like lords. But it’s the little ones, that’s what
it is: there are too many of us.

254

MADELEINE. Oh, come, come, Catherine!

CATHERINE. Well, ma’am, I ask you. We don’t go
spending our money at the theatre—

Brignac enters. He is a dark, good looking fellow of five-and-thirty,
rather stout, with a strong, vibrating voice, and
a southern accent.

BRIGNAC [to Josephine] And bring me the biscuits and
the bottle I told you to bring up this morning. The one
with the green seal.

JOSEPHINE. Yes, sir.

BRIGNAC. Aha, Lucie! A kiss, quick! Congratulate me!

LUCIE. It went well?

BRIGNAC. Splendidly. How are you, Madeleine? Immensely!
Ah, Catherine, it’s you. How are you?

CATHERINE. I was just going, sir.

BRIGNAC. I didn’t see your husband at the meeting.

CATHERINE. He wasn’t there, sir.

BRIGNAC. Ah, yes, yes. A regular fire-eater now, isn’t
he? Well, I hope his Socialism is profitable.

CATHERINE. Well, we might—

BRIGNAC. Get along better? I thought so. [In a changed
tone] Ah, Catherine, I used to know you and your family
when your husband went more to church than to his club.
You had faith then to help you bear up against your troubles!
You put your trust in Providence! Yes, you brought
up your children according to the Scriptures: ‘Consider
the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither
do they spin, and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.’

MADELEINE [shrugging her shoulders, low] Don’t,
Julien.

CATHERINE. Good bye, ma’am. Good bye, sir. [She goes
out].

BRIGNAC [to Madeleine] What is it?

MADELEINE. You should have more tact.

LUCIE [interposing] Come now, don’t quarrel, you two.
[To Madeleine] You’re not to get cross again. Tell us255
about your meeting.

BRIGNAC. First just to get back my strength!—[he
drinks a glass of the wine that Josephine has brought]. My
meeting? Well, it was a huge success. On the battle-field
Napoleon used to say: ‘One night of Paris will make up
for all this.’ If he lived now, he’d say: ‘One night of Paris—after
an address from Brignac!’ I tell you, I did magnificently.
And the audience was by no means only my
friends. I know that, because when I said—when I was
inspired to say—’God blesses large families—’

MADELEINE. Someone answered: ‘But he doesn’t support
them.’

BRIGNAC. Were you there?

MADELEINE. No, but the retort is so well known that
nowadays people don’t allude to blessings from above.
There’s too much suffering here below. It looks like a
bad joke.

BRIGNAC. Ah, that spirit of Voltaire! [He pours out
another glass of wine].

LUCIE. Don’t you think you’ve had enough, dear?

BRIGNAC [holding up the glass] What, of this wine?
From a vineyard that my father planted—!

LUCIE. That makes no difference.

BRIGNAC. Have you ever seen me drunk?

LUCIE. No.

BRIGNAC. Well then! [He drinks] Ah! Pure sunshine.
It brightens my heart to drink it! M. de Forgeau was
enchanted. Have you told Madeleine that I’m going to
stand?

LUCIE. Everyone knows about it.

BRIGNAC. So much the better. After today, I have
reason to think that there’s every chance of my being
elected. At last, we’ll have done with this narrow life of
a provincial lawyer! You’ll see! And who knows—between
ourselves, of course—who knows that some day I
shan’t have men on the bench coming to beg favors of
the Minister that they used to refuse to the simple law256yer!
Aha, and why not? Stranger things have happened.
[Walking about and rubbing his hands] Ah, there’ll be
some who’ll cut a queer figure then. [He pulls himself
up] Well, well. In the meantime the essential thing is
the deputation.

LUCIE. Yes.

BRIGNAC. We’re working at it. And what could be finer
than to advance one’s own interests in the very act of defending
one’s country? That is the best defence of it, to
help in the production of the human race itself, for it
means true morality within and the respect of other
countries from without.

MADELEINE. You didn’t forget that in your speech, I
hope?

BRIGNAC [simply] No, no; that was part of my peroration.
All Frenchmen ought to do like old Féchain.

LUCIE. Who’s he?

BRIGNAC. Old Féchain—he was one of the audience.
You’ll see him presently. He came to shake hands with
me after the meeting. He has twelve children—magnificent!
Magnificent, I repeat. I told him to come round
here.

MADELEINE. What for?

BRIGNAC. I don’t know, he was so worked up, I wanted
to show him a mark of my sympathy. He’ll tell you how
it went off; you don’t believe me, Madeleine.

MADELEINE. Indeed I do.

BRIGNAC. I saw you smiling. Yes, he’ll tell you. [Josephine
brings a card in] Dr. Hourtin? I know that name.

LUCIE. Oh yes, I forgot. It’s Dr. Hourtin, the professor
at Paris.

MADELEINE. I’ll see him, and explain.

LUCIE. Yes, do. [Madeleine goes out] It’s the doctor
we wanted to consult about the children, you know. He
happens to be at Chartres, and Madeleine met him at
some friends’.

Madeleine returns with Dr. Hourtin. He is a man of
257
thirtyfive, with short hair and a pointed beard.

HOURTIN [to Madeleine, as they come in] No apology is
needed.

MADELEINE [introducing him] My sister, Madame
Brignac; Monsieur Brignac. Professor Hourtin. [Greetings].

HOURTIN. I hear that your babies are in the country.
If you like, I could come in to see them tomorrow on my
way back. But only after dinner, I fear—my train gets
in late.

LUCIE. Of course! We shall be extremely grateful.

MADELEINE [to Lucie] I shall arrange to come as soon
as possible to hear what the doctor says.

BRIGNAC. Sit down, won’t you? I’m really delighted.
[Ringing] Let me offer you a biscuit and a glass of
Alicante.

HOURTIN. No, thank you.

BRIGNAC [speaking first in an undertone to Josephine,
who answers the bell] Just for the sake of company! And
so, here you are at Chartres—a stroke of luck for the town
and for us.

HOURTIN. I was going to see my brother at Châteaudun
and thought that I would visit the town on the way.

BRIGNAC. And see our famous cave—these prehistoric
remains?

HOURTIN. Anthropology interests me.

BRIGNAC. A thoroughly genuine discovery, too.

HOURTIN. Oh yes, there is no doubt.

LUCIE. I saw a photograph of some of the remains. It
was horrible.

HOURTIN. Don’t say that!

LUCIE. I dreamed of it all night. Were they really human
beings?

HOURTIN. The remains are undoubtedly those of a
household of the stone age. The man’s skeleton is intact,
the woman’s skull is fractured.

LUCIE. Poor woman! By a falling rock?

258

HOURTIN. Oh, no. The human fist of that date was
well able to give such a blow.

BRIGNAC. In fact, a little domestic difference?

HOURTIN [laughing] I can’t diagnose at such an interval.
But it is easy to imagine the man trying to drag
the woman into his den. She refuses. He raises his fist—a
blow to stun her, only he hits rather too hard.

LUCIE. How terrible!

HOURTIN. Those were the manners of our ancestor, the
cave man.

BRIGNAC. The world has changed.

MADELEINE. Yes. Since the cave man hypocrisy has
been invented.

HOURTIN. And we can imagine further. A rival springs
on the ravisher, strangles him, and leaves the two corpses
in the midst of the flint weapons and the kitchen utensils
of polished stone.

LUCIE. It’s enough to give one a nightmare.

HOURTIN [rising, to Lucie] Forgive me. [To Brignac]
I should have begun instead of ended by congratulating
you on the success of your meeting.

Josephine enters with a bottle and glasses on a tray.

BRIGNAC. You must not go without drinking to it, then.
Aha, I’m not from Chartres! Montpellier is my native
town; close by Montpellier, at least. Palavas—Palavas-les-Flots.
In my part of the country an honest man isn’t
afraid of a glass of wine. Alicante, you know!

HOURTIN. No, thank you, really.

BRIGNAC [filling his glass] I see. You’re afraid that my
Alicante comes from the grocer’s? No, no. My dear sir,
I am the son of a wine grower and I can answer for my
cellar, I assure you.

HOURTIN. I only drink water.

BRIGNAC. Ah! You belong to that school of doctors to
whom wine is anathema. Let me tell you you’re ruining
at one stroke the stomach of the north and the purse of the
south. Pessimists, that’s what you are. It’s nothing short259
of treason to slander the good wine of France. Here’s to
your health, and to mine, and to France! [He drinks].

HOURTIN [laughing] Allow me to point out that it’s
Spanish wine you are drinking.

BRIGNAC [laughing too] Yes; but I only drink this in a
small glass. Look here, I’ll prove to you that you’re
wrong. My father—you see, I don’t need to go far—died
at seventy five, as strong as an oak. He kept his vines and
his vines kept him. I can promise you he didn’t only drink
water. I don’t say that now and then—market day and
so on—he didn’t get a bit lively, a bit too lively, perhaps.
Well, did he suffer for it? On the contrary, it gave him
strength to support life and made him charitable to other
people’s little failings. A good glass of wine never hurt
anybody—there’s my witness you see—and my dear
father didn’t drink by the thimbleful, I can tell you. But
nowadays you think you see drunkards everywhere.

HOURTIN. With good reason.

BRIGNAC. Well, take me. Do I look healthy? Fit?

HOURTIN. I don’t judge people by their looks.

BRIGNAC. Well, then, I am fit. Ask my wife if I’ve ever
been ill. That’s the result of following my father’s example.
Never once ill at thirtyfive. Only, only—mark my
words—I drink nothing but good wine. You must admit
I’m right, for I’ve never been—I won’t say drunk, but
even ordinarily elevated. No, never. Isn’t that so, Lucie?
I’ll hold my own with anyone. I’ve often won bets about it.

LUCIE. But you know you sometimes have fits of passion.

BRIGNAC. That has nothing to do with it. That’s my
temperament. I’m built nervously.

HOURTIN. Never having been drunk proves nothing.

BRIGNAC. Oh, come!

HOURTIN. No. There are a large number of men who
drink, perhaps, a glass of vermouth before lunch, a bottle
of wine at lunch, and two or three glasses of liqueur after.
The same at dinner, after an absinthe and a glass or two260
of beer in the afternoon. They would be much astonished
to learn that they are thoroughly alcoholized.

BRIGNAC. Well, I do all that, and I’m as well as can be.
What is more, as a baby I was very delicate. I couldn’t
walk till I was eighteen months old or talk before two
years. And I’m from the south. Ha, ha! You’ll say I’m
making up for lost time?

HOURTIN [laughing] I shan’t try to convince you. Time
will do that.

BRIGNAC [glass in hand] In one way I’m of your mind.
I firmly believe that drink is a social evil, and I fight
against it. For poor people, who are underfed and drink
adulterated stuff. That’s different. There you’re right.
But alcohol is only bad on an empty stomach.

HOURTIN. Poor empty stomachs. But why don’t you
preach sobriety to them, instead of inciting them to have
children?

BRIGNAC. Don’t you approve of that?

HOURTIN. My own opinion is that the poor and the sick
have too many children and the rich not enough.

BRIGNAC. But—[To Josephine, who enters] What is it?

HOURTIN. Then I’ll be going. [To Lucie] Till tomorrow.

BRIGNAC [to Josephine] Shew him in. [To Hourtin]
Wait a moment—five minutes—two minutes only. I’ll
shew you a workman who has twelve children. Let’s see
what you say to that. [To Féchain] Come in, my friend,
come in.

Enter Féchain, a man of fifty, dressed in a workman’s
Sunday clothes. Where he stands on coming in he is unable
to see Hourtin.

FÉCHAIN. Good day, ladies and gentlemen.

LUCIE [to Madeleine] What a gay old thing!

MADELEINE. Ha, ha!

BRIGNAC. I am glad to see you here in my house and in
the midst of my family, and I congratulate you as a living
example of the fulfilment of duty. Give me your hand.

FÉCHAIN. Here you are, sir. [They shake hands].

261

BRIGNAC. What’s your name?

FÉCHAIN. Féchain.

BRIGNAC. Do you live at Chartres?

FÉCHAIN. Yes, sir, close by, in the valley.

BRIGNAC. What are you by trade?

FÉCHAIN. I do a job here and a job there.

BRIGNAC. And you have twelve children?

FÉCHAIN. The thirteenth coming, too.

BRIGNAC. What! My best congratulations.

MADELEINE. Your wife might have some of the congratulations
as well.

FÉCHAIN. Thank you, ma’am. I’ll tell her what you say.

MADELEINE. Is she in good health?

FÉCHAIN. Perfect.

BRIGNAC. That’s fine. You’re a grand fellow, a real example
of public virtue.

FÉCHAIN. It’s just the way I’m made, so I can’t help it.
[Laughing with stupid vanity] Aha, if only everyone were
like you or me! The way you talked, you know! Why,
number thirteen had to be on the way after that. How
many have you?

BRIGNAC. Two.

FÉCHAIN [making a face] What! what! Oh, you must
make up for lost time.

MADELEINE [to Lucie, low] Nasty old beast!

BRIGNAC [a little awkwardly] There, splendid. You’re
the right sort. Come and see me again some day. If you
want a recommendation— [He takes him to the door].

FÉCHAIN. Thank you kindly.

BRIGNAC. Goodbye.

FÉCHAIN. If I might make bold, sir, could you lend me
twentyeight francs? I’m a bit behind with my rent.

BRIGNAC. I’ll lay your request before the town authority
and second it warmly, I promise you.

MADELEINE. But perhaps he’s in need of it at once. [To
Féchain] Give me your address and I’ll bring you the
money. I shall be glad to pay my respects to that fine wife262
of yours.

FÉCHAIN. Oh, ma’am; but you’d be likely to miss her.
She’s often out of the house.

MADELEINE. That doesn’t matter. I shall see the children
anyway. Where do you live?

FÉCHAIN. You’re very kind, but I shouldn’t like a lady
like you to come to our sort of place. My landlord’ll wait
so long as he knows that M. Brignac is going to help me.
Thank you all the same.

HOURTIN [to Brignac] Let me say a word to this fellow.
I feel sure I’ve seen him somewhere. [Brignac nods. To
Féchain] Pardon me—

FÉCHAIN [starting] Oh! Good day, doctor.

HOURTIN. Ah, I thought so. I was sure I knew you. You
were working at the hospital once?

FÉCHAIN. Yes, sir.

HOURTIN. Quite so. No; you do not live at Chartres.

FÉCHAIN [after a silence] No, sir. I live at Paris. Only
when I see there’s to be a meeting like this not far away,
I go to it. I’m a poor man, and then—

HOURTIN. Then you get a loan from the chairman?

FÉCHAIN. If I can. Sometimes I’m asked to a dinner.

HOURTIN. Is it true you have twelve children?

FÉCHAIN [smiling] That? Oh, yes; I’ve got the proofs.
[He takes some papers from his pocket] Here are their birth
certificates, all twelve. I always have them about me—never
go without them—so as I can shew them. You can
count them.

HOURTIN [taking the papers] Do all your children live
with you?

FÉCHAIN. Oh, no. Why there aren’t more than seven
left.

HOURTIN. The others are dead?

FÉCHAIN. Poor folks can’t hope to keep all they have.

HOURTIN. When you had had five, you must have seen
that you couldn’t support them?

FÉCHAIN. Of course.

263

HOURTIN. And you had more all the same?

FÉCHAIN. We couldn’t have been worse off than we
were. One more or less makes no odds; and then, after
seven, things are easier.

HOURTIN. How’s that?

FÉCHAIN. This way. If you have three or four children,
no one bothers about you, you’re like everyone else; but
with seven or eight, then they have to help you. Relief
charities, or the authorities, or just people, that’s all one.
They daren’t say no. If you have ten, then it’s first class.
Only you mustn’t mind moving. But there, there’s nothing
to be had for nothing, is there?

HOURTIN. How many of your children are living with
you?

FÉCHAIN. Two.

HOURTIN. And the other five?

FÉCHAIN. The two girls are big enough to do for themselves.
The other three are in hospital. [A silence].

HOURTIN [looking at the papers] All your children are
not of the same mother, I see.

FÉCHAIN. No; I’ve been a widower twice. Oh, yes;
I’ve had my troubles. This is my third. It’s her fourth
she’s expecting.

MADELEINE [after a pause, to Lucie] A man like that
ought to be shut up.

HOURTIN [giving him back the papers] Thank you.

FÉCHAIN. Good day, sir. Good day, ladies. [To Brignac]
You couldn’t just let me have the money for the railway
and my ticket to the meeting? It’s only just a trifle.

HOURTIN [giving him some money] There.

FÉCHAIN. Thank you kindly, sir. [He goes out].

HOURTIN [taking leave] You see! Children who cannot
be kept ought not to be born. And I would add that those
who are born ought to be properly kept.

BRIGNAC. A pretext that would justify the shirking of
all duty. It’s impossible to see ahead like that.

HOURTIN. You don’t ask more people to dinner than you264
have room for, nor before dinner is ready. It will be time
to think of increasing our population when our housing
and means of livelihood are up to the mark of our existing
needs.

BRIGNAC. But each new generation is itself a means of
production.

HOURTIN. Certainly. I only ask that the poor should
have few children and the degenerate none. No child
ought to be brought into the world handicapped by illness
or want.

BRIGNAC. And as the result of your precautions our
country would fall in point of population to a fifth or a
tenth rate power.

HOURTIN [at the door] History teaches us that not even
military supremacy belongs to the largest nations. M. de
Marigny’s reflection, not mine. [Bowing to the ladies]
Till tomorrow. [Shaking Brignac’s hand] And when you
have a moment, just consider how society behaves to the
mothers of whom it demands children. You’ll find that an
entertaining subject—unless it makes you cry. Goodbye.

LUCIE [shewing him out] Then you will really come to
see my babies?

HOURTIN. Most certainly. [Lucie goes out with him].

MADELEINE. Well, my dear brother-in-law, what do you
say to that?

BRIGNAC [shrugging his shoulders] Oh, if I had wanted
to answer him—

MADELEINE. Why didn’t you?

BRIGNAC. Surely you can see that I was not going to
annoy a man whom we want to consult professionally. [A
pause. He looks at his watch. Lucie returns] Well, five
o’clock. I’m off to the club for my game of dominoes. Ta,
ta. You dine here, Madeleine, of course?

MADELEINE. No; I can’t. We’ve some official people to
go to in the evening. But I’ll look in for news of the chicks.

BRIGNAC. Very well. I’ll upset all Dr. Hourtin’s theories
for you in five seconds. You wait and see.

265

MADELEINE. All right.

BRIGNAC. Good bye. [He goes out].

MADELEINE. Annette not back yet?

LUCIE. She won’t be long now.

MADELEINE. Lucie, don’t you think perhaps she goes
rather too often to the Bernins?

LUCIE. Gabrielle’s her best friend.

MADELEINE. Hm, yes.

LUCIE. They’re both so keen on music. Besides, the
poor little dear doesn’t get too much fun. It’s dull for her
here. I can see she feels it, particularly lately. She only
brightens up when she goes to see Gabrielle.

MADELEINE. Yes; but that girl has a brother.

LUCIE. Jacques.

MADELEINE. Just so; Jacques.

LUCIE. Have you heard people talking about Annette
in connection with him?

MADELEINE. No. Well, then, yes; I have. Listen, dear.
We’re rather peculiarly placed, aren’t we? Three orphan
girls. I’m married; twice, though I’m only twenty-eight,
and you’re married, for the first time.

LUCIE. And for the last, I should hope.

MADELEINE [laughing] Tut, tut!

LUCIE [laughing too] Monster!

MADELEINE. Then you took our youngest sister to live
with you. A perfect arrangement, so long as you look
after her as you would after your own girl, or as mother
would have done.

LUCIE. She’s eighteen.

MADELEINE. That’s just it.

LUCIE. I don’t see what danger there is for Annette.

MADELEINE. Nor do I. But we’re not alone in the world.
As it is, people look astonished—of course it’s a silly little
provincial place—at her going out alone.

LUCIE. Oh, to see Gabrielle, five minutes off!

MADELEINE. I know, I know. Tell me, do you think
that the Bernin boy would be a possible match for Annette?

266

LUCIE. I never thought about it. Well, why not?

MADELEINE. Hm, hm!

LUCIE. He’s about the right age. He seems to be a good
fellow.

MADELEINE. Oh, yes.

LUCIE. His family is well enough.

MADELEINE. And—the money?

LUCIE. Yes; that’s true. The Bernins are rich and Annette
has nothing. Yes; you’re right. She was going to
spend a week with them in the country. I’ll find an excuse
for her not going. Perhaps I had better say something
to her about it.

MADELEINE. There’s no hurry; but we must see that no
harm happens to our little pet.

LUCIE. Good heavens! I should never forgive myself.

Annette, fair, eighteen years old, runs in, overflowing
with joy.

ANNETTE. What luck! Madeleine, too! Here, Josephine!
[She throws her hat to Josephine, who drops it on the
floor] Oh, stupid! [Recovering herself] All right, there.
Don’t be cross, Fifine. [She kisses Josephine and shoves
her out].

LUCIE. What’s the matter?

MADELEINE. Why so radiant?

ANNETTE. Yes, I am! I am! Oh, I’m so happy!

LUCIE. Is that why you kissed Josephine?

ANNETTE. Josephine! Why, I could have kissed the
passers by in the street!

MADELEINE [laughing] Our little girl’s gone cracked.

ANNETTE. No, no; only—oh, I’m so happy. [She
bursts into a fit of sobbing].

LUCIE. Annette, what’s the matter?

MADELEINE. Annette!

ANNETTE [through her tears] Oh, I am happy, happy!

LUCIE. She’ll make herself ill. Madeleine, call someone.

ANNETTE. No, no; don’t worry. Don’t say anything.
It’s only my nerves. [Laughing and crying at the same267
time] Oh, I am happy, only—how silly to cry like that!
But I can’t help it. [She puts her arm round Lucie’s neck,
who is kneeling beside her, and draws Madeleine’s head
towards her] Lucie, darling! Madeleine, dearest! [She
kisses them, then sobs again] How silly! It’s no good; I
must. There [she dries her eyes], there. Now I can tell
you. [With a pure look of deeply felt happiness] I’m going
to be married. M. and Mme. Bernin are coming.

LUCIE. Why?

ANNETTE. Because they’re going to the country to-morrow.

MADELEINE. They’re going away?

ANNETTE. Yes; Jacques has told them.

LUCIE. Jacques?

ANNETTE [in a sudden rush] Yes. It all happened like
that, with our music—Gabrielle and me. That was how,
and he guessed everything. He sings tenor—oh, not very
well. Once [with a laugh]—but I’ll tell you later. That
was how it came about; and we’re to be married soon.
[Crying again, then gravely pressing Lucie to her] I love
him so! Oh, if you only knew! If he hadn’t married me,
it would have been so dreadful. You don’t understand?

MADELEINE [smiling] Perhaps we can guess.

ANNETTE. Shall I tell you everything, everything from
the beginning?

LUCIE. Yes.

ANNETTE. I should love to tell you. You won’t mind?

MADELEINE. Go on.

ANNETTE. It was like that, when Gabrielle and I were
playing duets. At first I hated him because he always
laughs at everything, but at bottom he’s good. Do you
know what he once—

LUCIE. Never mind that. Go on about the music.

ANNETTE. Well, as I was saying, Gabrielle and I used to
play duets. He used to come and listen to us. He stood
behind and turned over the pages. Then once he put his
hand on my shoulder—

268

MADELEINE. And you didn’t say anything?

ANNETTE. He had his other hand on Gabrielle’s. I
should have looked so idiotic.

LUCIE. Gabrielle’s not the same thing.

ANNETTE. Just what I was going to say. My heart beat
so hard and I felt my face all scarlet, that I hardly knew
what I was playing. Then another time, when he couldn’t
follow, he bent right over. Oh, but I can’t tell you everything,
little by little. We love one another, that’s all.

MADELEINE. And he has told you that he loves you?

ANNETTE [gravely] Yes.

LUCIE. And you kept all that from me! That wasn’t
right, Annette.

ANNETTE. Oh, forgive me; but it came about so gradually,
I could hardly say when it began. I said to myself
that it couldn’t be true, and when—when we did tell one
another what we hadn’t ever said, though we knew it ourselves,
then I knew I’d done wrong, only I was so ashamed
that I couldn’t tell you about it.

LUCIE [gently] But it was wrong, my little pet.

ANNETTE. Oh, don’t scold me! Please, please, don’t!
If you knew how I’ve been feeling—oh, how dreadfully
badly! You didn’t notice.

LUCIE. Yes, I did.

MADELEINE. Has he spoken to his parents?

ANNETTE. Oh, a long time ago.

LUCIE. They consent?

ANNETTE. They’re coming here this afternoon.

MADELEINE. Why didn’t they come sooner?

ANNETTE. Because—Jacques told them you see; but
they didn’t want it talked about. They wanted Gabrielle
to get married first. So we agreed that I should seem not
to think they knew anything about it. Then today I met
Jacques in the street—

LUCIE. In the street!

ANNETTE. Yes. He’s given up coming to the music, so
I meet him—

269

LUCIE. In the street!

ANNETTE. As a rule, we only bow to each other; but to-day,
as he passed me he said: ‘My parents are going to
your sister’s today.’ He was quite pale. Don’t scold me,
please! I’m so happy. Do forgive me!

MADELEINE [to Lucie, who looks silently at Annette]
Come, forgive her.

LUCIE [kissing her] Oh, yes, I forgive her. So you want
to leave us, bad girl?

ANNETTE. Yes. I am bad and ungrateful, I know.

LUCIE. Hush, hush! Nonsense!

MADELEINE. Marriage is a serious thing, Annette. Are
you sure that your characters agree together?

ANNETTE. Oh, yes, yes. Why, we’ve quarrelled already!

LUCIE. What about?

ANNETTE. About a book he lent me.

MADELEINE. What book?

ANNETTE. Anna Karenina. He liked Vronsky better
than Levine. He said such silly things. And he couldn’t
understand Anna Karenina killing herself—you know—when
she throws herself underneath the train that he’s
in. You remember, don’t you?

LUCIE. And then?

ANNETTE. Then—there’s the bell. Perhaps it’s them.

A pause. Josephine enters with a card.

LUCIE. Yes.

ANNETTE. Oh, heavens!

LUCIE. Madeleine, take Annette. Go through her room.

MADELEINE. All right.

LUCIE [to Josephine] Shew Madame Bernin in.

ANNETTE [to Lucie] Don’t be long.

Annette goes out with Madeleine. Lucie arranges herself
before a glass. Josephine shews in Madame Bernin.

LUCIE. How do you do?

MME. BERNIN. How are you?

LUCIE. Very well, thank you. And you?

MME. BERNIN. I need not ask news of M. Brignac. I know270
he is busy fighting the good fight.

LUCIE. And M. Bernin?

MME. BERNIN. He’s very well, thanks. I hope your children—

LUCIE. About the same. But won’t you sit down?

MME. BERNIN. Thank you. What lovely weather!

LUCIE. Yes; isn’t it?

MME. BERNIN. I hear there was a large audience at M.
Brignac’s meeting.

LUCIE. Yes, indeed.

MME. BERNIN. In spite of the heat.

LUCIE. You are happy to be able to go to the country.
Annette was so delighted to get your kind invitation.

MME. BERNIN. That was precisely my object in calling
here today—apart from the pleasure of seeing you—to
talk about that plan of ours.

LUCIE. And about another one, I think?

MME. BERNIN. Another?

LUCIE. No?

MME. BERNIN. No; I don’t know what you are referring
to.

LUCIE. Oh, I beg your pardon, then. Please go on.
About Annette?

MME. BERNIN. My daughter has had an invitation to join
our cousins, the Guibals, for some time, and we absolutely
cannot refuse to send Gabrielle to them. So I came to ask
you to excuse us, as Gabrielle will not be there.

LUCIE. Will you forgive me for being indiscreet?

MME. BERNIN. I am sure you couldn’t be.

LUCIE. I wanted to ask you, is it long since Gabrielle received
this invitation?

MME. BERNIN. About a week.

LUCIE. Indeed!

MME. BERNIN. Why should that surprise you?

LUCIE. She said nothing about it to Annette.

MME. BERNIN. She was probably afraid of disappointing
her.

271

LUCIE. Only yesterday Annette was telling me of all the
excursions that your daughter had planned to make with
her. Please, please, tell me the truth. This invitation is
merely an excuse; I feel convinced it is. Please tell me.
Annette is only my sister, but I love her as though she
were my child. Think it’s her mother who is speaking to
you. I won’t try to be clever. I’m not going to stand on
my dignity. This is what has happened. Annette believes
that your son loves her, and when your card was brought
in she imagined that you had come to ask her for him.
Now you know everything that I know, and I beg you to
talk as candidly to me, so that we may avoid as much unhappiness
as possible.

MME. BERNIN. You have spoken to me so simply and feelingly
that I can’t help answering openly—from the bottom
of my heart. Yes, then, this invitation to Gabrielle is
only an excuse. We have invented it to prevent Jacques
and Annette from meeting again.

LUCIE. You don’t want them to meet again?

MME. BERNIN. No; because I don’t want them to marry.

LUCIE. Because Annette is poor?

MME. BERNIN [hesitates, then] Well, since we have agreed
to be perfectly candid, that is the reason.

LUCIE. You would not consent to the idea of their marrying?

MME. BERNIN. No.

LUCIE. Is that absolutely final?

MME. BERNIN. Absolutely final.

LUCIE. Because Annette has no dowry?

MME. BERNIN. Yes.

LUCIE. But your son knew that she was poor. It’s monstrous
of him to have made her love him.

MME. BERNIN. If he had acted as you describe, I admit
it would be monstrous. But he had no intention of engaging
her affections. Annette was a friend of his sister’s.
I am sure he had no idea in meeting her beyond that of
simple good comradeship. Very likely he went on to pay272
her some attention; indeed he might well have been attracted
by her. Your sweet little Annette, who is the most
innocent of creatures, has fallen more easily and more
deeply, perhaps, in love. Innocence like hers is closely
akin to ignorance. But that my son has more to reproach
himself with! You can easily see that he has not, because
it was he who told me about it himself.

LUCIE. How long ago?

MME. BERNIN. Just now. He told me that he was in love
with Annette, as she, no doubt, thinks herself with him;
and, in fact, he begged me to come and ask for her hand.

LUCIE. Only today?

MME. BERNIN. A couple of hours since.

LUCIE. Annette implored him to tell you. He said he
had already done so and that you had given your consent.

MME. BERNIN. Never.

LUCIE. A month ago.

MME. BERNIN. Until today he never said anything to me.

LUCIE. Annette told me so herself!

MME. BERNIN. He never said anything to me.

LUCIE. Do you mean that she lied?

MME. BERNIN. He never said anything to me.

LUCIE. Do you think her truthful?

MME. BERNIN. Yes.

LUCIE. Candid, honest?

MME. BERNIN. Yes.

LUCIE. Well, then?

MME. BERNIN. Well, it is possible that he did not tell her
the truth. After all, he’s a man.

LUCIE. And in love, men have the right to lie?

MME. BERNIN. They think so.

LUCIE. And when you told him to give up Annette, he
agreed?

MME. BERNIN. Yes, he did. He is a sensible, practical
fellow, and he could not help seeing the force of what I
said. He realizes that however hard it may be for him to
break with Annette, it is necessary. I need hardly say he273
feels it keenly, but at these children’s age feelings change.

LUCIE. I see. A week hence your son won’t think of
her. But she?

MME. BERNIN. She will forget him, too.

LUCIE. I don’t know about that. Oh, my poor darling!
If you could have seen her here just now when she came
to tell us! She cried with joy! It’s not for joy that she’ll
cry now. Oh, my God! [She breaks into tears].

MME. BERNIN [moved] Oh, don’t! Please, please! I understand
your grief; indeed I do. Ah, if it were possible,
how happy it would make me for Annette to marry my
boy. I tell you I have had to stop myself from loving her.
What a contrast to the girl he will have to marry—tiresome,
affected creature.

LUCIE. If what you say is true, aren’t you rich enough
to let your son marry a poor girl?

MME. BERNIN. No; we are not so well off as people suppose.
And then we must give Gabrielle a dowry.

LUCIE. You’ll find her a husband who will want her for
herself.

MME. BERNIN. Even if we did, which I doubt, I would
not desire a man like that for her, because he would be
blind to the realities of the situation. Gabrielle has not
been brought up to poverty, but to a life of luxurious surroundings.

LUCIE. Give your children an equal amount, then.

MME. BERNIN. All that we can give Gabrielle will not be
too much. Life is hard, and becomes a harder struggle
every day. Young men tend to ask more with their wives,
because they know the power of money in the keen competition
of modern existence.

LUCIE. Oh, yes; they know it! Their creed is to have
enjoyment as soon as possible, without making the least
sacrifice for it, and a fig for gentleness or emotion!

MME. BERNIN. You may be right. I want Gabrielle to be
rich because riches will attract more bidders for her hand,
so that she will have more choice.

274

LUCIE. You have to speak of it even like a business transaction.

MME. BERNIN. Consequently there will be little or nothing
for Jacques.

LUCIE. People who have no money work.

MME. BERNIN. He was not brought up to work.

LUCIE. Then he ought to have been.

MME. BERNIN. The professions are already overstocked.
Do you propose that he should become a clerk at two hundred
francs a month? He and his wife wouldn’t be able to
keep a servant.

LUCIE. There are clerks who get more than that.

MME. BERNIN. Even if he got five hundred, would that
enable him to keep up his social position? Of course it
would not. He would owe his inferiority to his wife, and
would soon begin to reproach her with it. And have you
thought about their children? They would have just
enough to send their son to the primary school and make
their daughter a post office clerk. Even for that they would
be terribly pinched.

LUCIE. Yes.

MME. BERNIN. You see I’m right. I can’t say I’m proud
to confess so much, but what are we to do? Life is ordered
by things as they are, not like a novel. We live in a shrewd,
vain, selfish world.

LUCIE. You despise it and yet sacrifice everything to it.

MME. BERNIN. I know that everybody’s happiness practically
depends on the consideration he has in it. Only
exceptional people can disregard social conventions, and
Jacques is not an exception.

LUCIE. If I were you, I don’t think I should be proud of
it. If he were a little more than commonplace, his love
would give him strength to stand up against the jeers of
the crowd.

MME. BERNIN. His love! Love passes, poverty stays;
you know the proverb. Beauty fades; want grows.

LUCIE. But you yourself—you and your husband are275
the living proof that one can marry poor and make money!
Everyone knows how your husband began as a small
clerk, then started in a small business of his own, then
won success. If that spells happiness, you and he must be
happy.

MME. BERNIN. No; we have not been happy, because we
have used ourselves up with hunting for happiness. We
meant to ‘get there’; we have ‘got there,’ but at what a
price! Oh, I know the road to fortune. At first miserable,
sordid economy, passionate greed; then the fierce struggle
of trickery and deceit, always flattering your customers,
always living in terror of failure. Tears, lies, envy, contempt.
Suffering for yourself and for everyone round you.
I’ve been through it, and a bitter experience it was. We’re
determined that our children shan’t. Our children! We
have had only two, but we meant to have only one. That
extra one meant double toil and hardship. Instead of being
a husband and wife helping one another, we have been two
business partners, watching each other like enemies, perpetually
quarrelling, even on our very pillow, over our expenditure
or our mistakes. Finally we succeeded; and
now we can’t enjoy our wealth because we don’t know how
to use it, and because our later years are poisoned by memories
of the hateful past of suffering and rancor. No; I
shall never expose my children to that struggle. I only
stood it to preserve them from it. Good bye.

LUCIE. Good bye.

Madame Bernin goes out. After a moment Lucie goes
slowly to Annette’s door and opens it.

ANNETTE [coming in] You’ve been crying! It’s because
I’m going away, isn’t it? There’s nothing to prevent us,
is there? [With rising emotion] Lucie, tell me there’s nothing!

LUCIE. You love him so much?

ANNETTE. If we were not to be married, I should die.

LUCIE. No; you wouldn’t. Have all the little girls who
said that died?

276

ANNETTE. But there is nothing to prevent us, is there?

LUCIE. No, no.

ANNETTE. And when is it to be? Did you talk of that?

LUCIE. My dear, my dear, what a state you’re in! You
really must be less nervous.

ANNETTE [restraining herself] Yes, sweet, yes; I’m a
little crazy.

LUCIE. I think you are.

ANNETTE. Tell me, then, everything. How did she
begin?

LUCIE. Are you in such a hurry to leave me? You don’t
love me any more?

ANNETTE [gravely] Oh, if I hadn’t got you, what would
become of me? [A silence]. But you’re not telling me
anything. There must be something. You’re keeping the
truth from me. If there wasn’t something, you’d say there
wasn’t—you wouldn’t try to put me off—you’d tell me
just what Madame Bernin said.

LUCIE. Well, then, there is something.

ANNETTE [breaking into tears] Oh, heavens!

LUCIE. You’re both very young. You must wait. A year,
perhaps longer.

ANNETTE [crying] Wait! A year!

LUCIE. Come, come, you must not be so uncontrolled,
Annette. You’ll make me displeased with you. Why, you
are barely nineteen. If you wait to be married till you are
twenty, there’ll be no great harm.

ANNETTE. It isn’t possible.

LUCIE. Not possible? [With a long look at her] Annette,
you frighten me. If it were not you— [With tender gravity]
I can’t have been wrong to trust you?

ANNETTE. No, no. What can you be thinking of? I promise
you—

LUCIE. What is it, then?

ANNETTE. Well, I’ve been foolish enough to tell some of
my friends that I was engaged.

LUCIE. Before telling me about it?

277

ANNETTE [confused] Don’t ask me any more questions.
Please, please don’t!

LUCIE. Indeed, I must scold you. You deserve it. You
have hurt me very much by not letting me know what was
going on. I could never have believed that you would keep
me so in the dark, whoever had said it of you. I thought
you were too fond of me. I was wrong. We see each other
every day, all the time, and you could still hide from me
what was in your heart. It was very, very wrong of you.
Not only because I am your elder sister, but because I am
in mother’s place towards you. And then, if only that, because
I am your friend. A little more, and I should have
heard of your engagement from strangers. Well, my dear,
you’ve made a bad choice, and now you’ll need all your
courage. These people aren’t worth your tears. I’m going
to tell you everything. They don’t want you, my poor
dear; you’re too poor for them.

ANNETTE [staring] They don’t want me! They don’t
want me! But he—Jacques—he knows they don’t?

LUCIE. Yes; he knows.

ANNETTE. He’ll do what they say, if they tell him to give
me up?

LUCIE. Yes.

ANNETTE [madly] I must see him. I’ll write to him. I
must see him! If they don’t want me, I’ve nothing but to
kill myself!

LUCIE [forcing Annette to look at her] Look at me, Annette.
[Silence. Then in the same grave, tender voice]
Have you not a secret to trust me with?

ANNETTE [disengaging herself] Don’t ask me anything
[very low] or I shall die of shame at your feet.

Lucie forces her to sit down at her side and takes her in
her arms.

LUCIE. Come, come here, in my arms. So. Put your
head on my shoulder, as you used when you were tiny.
Tell me, what is it? [Quite low] My sweet, my little darling,
are you terribly, terribly unhappy? Speak out, from278
your heart, as you would to our poor mother.

ANNETTE [very low, in tears of shame] Oh, mother, if you
knew what your little girl had done!

LUCIE [almost nursing her] Tell me; whisper, quite low,
in my ear. [She rises and breaks loose, then hides her face
in her hands]. Oh, you, Annette, you!

ANNETTE [on her knees, her arms stretched out] Forgive
me! Forgive me! My dear one, forgive me! Oh, I deserve
it all, everything you can say; but, oh, I am so unhappy!

LUCIE. You, Annette, you!

ANNETTE. Forgive me! Do you want me to be sorry I
didn’t kill myself without telling you? Forgive me!

LUCIE [raising her] My dear, my dear! You’ve suffered
too much not to be forgiven.

279

ACT II

The same scene. Evening. Electric light.

LUCIE. Now you know. I sent for you as soon as possible.

MADELEINE [who is in evening dress] There is only one
thing to do. Tell your husband everything and make him
go to the Bernins.

LUCIE. My God!

MADELEINE. The doctor is a long time with him. I absolutely
must go to this party.

LUCIE. Yes, go. But you’ll come back?

MADELEINE. As soon as I can. Don’t despair. Poor little
Annette!

LUCIE. Do you think—?

MADELEINE. Good bye for the moment. Don’t move.

Madeleine goes out, and the servant is seen giving her
her cloak. Lucie, alone, walks restlessly to and fro. As she
comes to the door of Brignac’s study, she stops to listen.

LUCIE [aloud, to herself] How loud the doctor’s speaking.
One would think they had quarrelled.

Fresh pause. The study door opens. Enter Hourtin and
Brignac.

BRIGNAC. I can assure you, Dr. Hourtin, that I have
reached years of discretion.

HOURTIN. It was my duty, sir, to speak to you as I have
done.

BRIGNAC [shewing him to the door, drily] I am obliged
to you.

280

HOURTIN. I have something else to say to Madame Brignac.

BRIGNAC. About me?

HOURTIN. About herself and the children; but if you object—

BRIGNAC. I hardly imagine it is indispensable.

LUCIE. What is it? Dr. Hourtin, I beg you will tell me
what you think I ought to know.

BRIGNAC. I haven’t time to waste over this subject. I repeat
I am exceedingly busy, and I have to make a speech
this evening. You must excuse my leaving you. Good
bye.

Hourtin bows. Brignac goes out, slamming the door of
his study.

LUCIE. I trust you will forgive my husband if he has annoyed
you.

HOURTIN. A doctor cannot be annoyed at the symptoms
of a disease. I would no more be indignant at M. Brignac’s
temper than bear malice against him for having fever in
an attack of pneumonia.

LUCIE. You wanted to speak to him. Is there something
about the children?

HOURTIN. If you see that the children are treated as your
own doctor and I have prescribed in our consultation, I
am confident that their condition will improve. But I have
something more to say to you yourself. Not long ago I was
called in to a married couple, one of whom was a victim to
morphia and refused to give up the use of the poison. The
children of the marriage were degenerate, and there was
every reason to think that should others be born they
would be even less healthy than the first. I had to inform
the other parent concerned of the facts, in order, if possible,
to discover some means of cure. Towards you I have
the same duty. With the difference that here the poison
is alcohol instead of morphia, the cases are identical. Like
my other patient, M. Brignac refused to listen to me; and
although his obstinacy is due to his poisoned condition, I281
confess I was unable, in spite of a physician’s philosophy,
to see without irritation the way in which he is rushing
to ruin, intellectual and physical. Now your nerves are
strong. I was unwilling to go away without speaking to
you.

LUCIE. My children?

HOURTIN. Your children are suffering from a nervous
complaint which was born with them.

LUCIE. As the result, you mean, of their father’s intemperance?
Our own doctor and another besides have already
told me the same thing.

HOURTIN. They should have begun by telling M. Brignac.

LUCIE. They did.

HOURTIN. Well?

LUCIE. He listened no more to them than he did to you.

HOURTIN. Is he not fond of the children?

LUCIE. In his own way he is. But he will never change
his way of living.

HOURTIN. So much the worse for him.

LUCIE. He did try once. He was incapable of work and
became sad, weak, restless.

HOURTIN. Like a morphinomaniac deprived of his drug.

LUCIE. To his mind the experiment was decisive. He
simply cannot study a brief or speak in court without the
help of his usual stimulant. He thinks it does him no harm.

HOURTIN. He has only to look at the children.

LUCIE. What he says is that at their age he had nervous
convulsions, and that now he is perfectly well.

HOURTIN. Precisely. He received from his father a legacy
that he has transmitted to them in a graver degree.
His father drank, but his life was the healthy, active, open
air life of a peasant, and his power of resistance greater
because he probably did not inherit a morbid tendency.
Your husband’s life is sedentary and feverish. Moreover,
he does inherit the tendency. You tell me that he had
convulsions in infancy; yesterday he said he was a back282ward
child. These are symptoms just as much as his
desire for drink and his irritability. He had a taint at
birth that he has increased. His children suffer from a
cumulative degeneracy. The grandfather drank, the son
suffers from alcoholism, the children are nervous invalids.

LUCIE. Horrible.

HOURTIN. You must use all your influence with your
husband to cure him.

LUCIE. He won’t listen to me.

HOURTIN. You must insist. You must make him see his
duty as a father.

LUCIE. It would be so useless that I shall not even try.

HOURTIN [rising] Then I have only one further piece
of advice for you both: don’t have any more children.

LUCIE. No more children?

HOURTIN. No.

LUCIE. Why not?

HOURTIN. Because it is to be feared that any you might
now have would be more diseased than the first.

LUCIE. Is that certain?

HOURTIN. In medicine there are no certainties; only
probabilities. The chances are, perhaps, five to one that
I am right. Would you venture to give any creature so
doubtful an existence?

LUCIE. I! No, indeed. Most likely you have said as
much to my husband. Won’t he believe you?

HOURTIN. You must make him realize that the responsibility
of having a child, great as it always is, becomes terrible
when, so far from its being born into normal circumstances,
it runs the risk of going into the world worse
equipped than usual. To give birth to a child doomed to
unhappiness or likely to be an invalid or incapable of
growing up is like crippling someone. It is as much a
crime as robbery or murder. Children ought to be deliberately
and soberly brought into the world by parents
healthy enough to give them health and of sufficient
means to ensure their complete development. You must283
forgive me. When I get on this subject I hardly know how
to stop. But really there is so much unavoidable misery
and distress that we ought not to add to the sum of general
suffering for which there is no remedy.

Enter Madeleine. She wears an opera cloak and a mantilla
over her evening dress. During the following scene
Josephine helps her off with her things.

MADELEINE. How do you do, Dr. Hourtin? I’m so glad
to find you still here. I’ve only just been able to get away
from the party. I had to go. There’s nothing serious the
matter with the children, I hope?

HOURTIN. Nothing serious. With the care of a mother
like theirs, I have every confidence. Now I was just going.
Good bye.

MADELEINE. Good bye. Thank you.

LUCIE. I’m extremely grateful to you, Dr. Hourtin.

HOURTIN. Don’t mention it. Good bye, good bye. [He
goes out].

LUCIE. Oh, Madeleine!

MADELEINE. What is it?

LUCIE. Do you know why the children are ill? Because
of Julien’s intemperance.

MADELEINE. My poor darling! But you knew that before.
Our doctor said so; and when they went to Paris
with me, the man there said the same.

LUCIE. I tried to make myself believe it wasn’t true.

MADELEINE. And Annette?

LUCIE. Has anything fresh happened?

MADELEINE. Yes; the Bernins have announced Jacques’
engagement to his cousin. They want to put an end to the
business. People were talking of the engagement this
evening.

LUCIE. Ah! And they’re still going away this evening.

MADELEINE. At ten o’clock. How does she take it?

LUCIE. She is in her room, waiting as though she expected
something. She said just now she knew the Bernins
would not go this evening. What can she hope?

284

MADELEINE. We must tell her about the engagement.
She mustn’t be left to hear of it from strangers.

LUCIE. No, no.

MADELEINE. And your husband?

LUCIE. He’s working in there. There’s to be a political
meeting, a smoking concert or something, after the dinner
at the Prefecture to-night. He heard at the last moment
that he was expected to speak, on the budget of the
Department, I think. I don’t know exactly. Anyway, he’s
there.

MADELEINE. Fetch Annette, then.

LUCIE. Yes. [She goes out. A short silence. Then she
calls outside] Madeleine! Madeleine!

MADELEINE [running to the door] What is it?

LUCIE [returning] She isn’t there.

MADELEINE. Where is she?

LUCIE. Gone! She’s left a note. She’s gone to look for
him. Quick! Your carriage is here. Go and find her.
Help her!

MADELEINE. Gone!

LUCIE. Yes. Quick! Go!

Madeleine goes out. Enter Brignac.

BRIGNAC. What is all this noise about?

LUCIE. Julien, I’ve something very serious to say to you.
A disaster has fallen on us.

BRIGNAC. The children!

LUCIE. No; it’s about Annette.

BRIGNAC. Is she ill?

LUCIE. Not ill, but in cruel, horrible grief.

BRIGNAC. Grief at her age! A love affair, eh? She’s
been jilted?

LUCIE. That’s it.

BRIGNAC. Whew! I breathe again. You frightened me.
Not so very serious.

LUCIE. Yes; it is. My dear, you must listen with all your
heart and with all your mind—and be kind.

BRIGNAC. But what’s the matter?

285

LUCIE. Annette has fallen in love with a scoundrel who
has deceived her. The poor child committed the mistake
of trusting him completely. He promised to marry her
and took advantage of her innocence to seduce her. [Low]
Understand me, Julien: she is going to have a baby in six
months.

BRIGNAC. Annette?

LUCIE. Annette.

BRIGNAC. Impossible. It’s—

LUCIE. It was she who confessed to me. She is sure of it.

BRIGNAC [after a silence] Who’s the man?

LUCIE. Jacques Bernin.

BRIGNAC. Jacques Bernin!

LUCIE. Yes.

BRIGNAC [furious] Here’s a fine piece of business! Ha,
at the moment of my election, too! Magnificent! Oh,
she’s done me to rights, your sister has! All’s up with me
now. We may as well pack our trunks and be off.

LUCIE. You exaggerate.

BRIGNAC. Do I? I tell you if she had been caught stealing—stealing,
do you hear?—it wouldn’t have been worse.
Even that would have compromised me less—thrown me
less absolutely out of the running.

LUCIE. Leave that till later. Now the thing is to save
her. You’ll go tomorrow morning, won’t you, Julien, and
find this fellow? Make him see what an abominable crime
it would be for him to desert our poor little girl.

BRIGNAC. Much you know him, M. Jacques Bernin. But
I do! He’ll laugh in my face. His one idea is to get on in
the world. Why, he was talking of his engagement to
Mademoiselle Dormance two months ago and chortling
over her shekels. Good lord, what a man for your sister
to hit upon!

LUCIE. But you won’t abandon her?

BRIGNAC. Yes; I’m in a nice place. Who’d have thought
it? So this is the thanks I get for all I’ve done for her!

LUCIE. Don’t fly into a rage!

286

BRIGNAC. Her! her! A child brought up in the strictest
principles, brought up at home here by you and me,
not allowed to read novels or go to the theatre! She hasn’t
even the excuse of having been to a boarding school. Why,
sometimes we could hardly help laughing at her ignorance
of life.

LUCIE. Perhaps if she had been less ignorant, she would
have run less risk.

BRIGNAC [breaking out] That’s right! Now it’s all my
fault!

LUCIE. Don’t get into a passion!

BRIGNAC. I shall if I like! And I think there’s some reason,
too! Annette!

LUCIE. Annette is only a victim.

BRIGNAC [shouting] A victim! I tell you there’s only
one victim here! Only one! And do you know who?

LUCIE. You, I suppose.

BRIGNAC. Yes; it is. Look here. Can’t you see the jokes
that will be made about me, the ironical congratulations—me,
the apostle of repopulation? Ha, they’ll say that if
I don’t give an example myself, my family does!

LUCIE. Julien, Julien, please!

BRIGNAC. Just when I thought I had done with vegetating
as a provincial lawyer, when my patience and ability
had got me accepted as candidate!

LUCIE. You might not have been elected.

BRIGNAC. I should have been! Even if it were not me,
our side would win. Once in the Chamber, I should have
done with this wretched obscure existence.

LUCIE. And then?

BRIGNAC. Then? A deputy gets any amount of work,
and wins his cases, too! Judges listen very differently to
a man who any day may become Minister of Justice. It
means something to them. And now this catastrophe! I
tell you that here, at Chartres, it spells ruin.

LUCIE. How you exaggerate! Who’s to know?

BRIGNAC. Who’s to know? Next Sunday every person287
in the town’ll be talking of it. And my political opponents,
do you think they’ll scruple? Not only them either.
M. de Forgeau and his committee won’t give the electors
the chance to turn me down. Within a week I shall be
shewn the door. You see! It’ll be lucky if no one insinuates
that I seduced the girl myself!

LUCIE. Oh!

BRIGNAC. This is a provincial town! This is Chartres!

LUCIE. So when an unhappy woman is seduced by a
scoundrel, her shame, if shame there is, falls on her whole
family! Is that the system you uphold?

BRIGNAC. Society must defend itself against immorality.
Without the guarantee of social punishment, there
would soon be hardly any except illegitimate children.

LUCIE. If anyone is guilty, two are. Why do you only
punish the mother?

BRIGNAC. How should I know? Because it’s easier.

LUCIE. But you can’t sit still and do nothing. You must
do something! You’re the head of the family.

BRIGNAC. Something! Something! What? The only
logical thing I know is to take a pistol—

LUCIE. Julien!

BRIGNAC. And go coolly and put a bullet through the
man’s head. No? A crime, is it? Ah, if we lived in an age
with a little more guts! [As if to himself] No; I’m not
sure it’s not my duty to go and do justice myself

LUCIE. Julien, you’re not dreaming of that!

BRIGNAC. And why not?

LUCIE. Think of the scandal, and then—

BRIGNAC. And then I should be tried for murder? Well,
do you think I’m afraid of that? What then? I should
defend myself, and I can tell you not many people have
heard such a speech as I should make! Think of the effect
on the jury! I should be acquitted, and the public would
cheer till the court had to be cleared. [A pause]. He’s in
luck’s way, the brute, that I’ve too much respect for human
life. If I weren’t a bit old fashioned—ha, so much288
for him. [A pause]. No, no; the weak point in these folk
is their pocket. That’s what I’ll go for. That’s it. We’ll
bring an action, an action for the seduction of an infant.

LUCIE. Publish her shame like that!

BRIGNAC. He’ll have his share of it. I’ll make him sing
another tune, so I will. We’ll ask twenty, fifty, a hundred
thousand francs damages! It’ll be a dowry for Annette.
Yes; we can do that, an ordinary civil action, or else, if
we like, prosecute him criminally. I could shew you the
law about it; it’s all in the reports. And besides, the way
I’ll conduct the case, the papers will boom it sky high.

LUCIE. You can’t surely want to have the papers talking
about us, printing poor Annette’s story, discussing
her honor?

BRIGNAC. Reflecting on me, too. If only we weren’t
related!

LUCIE. We should be just as much dishonored.

BRIGNAC. If you hadn’t made me take Annette to live
with us when your parents died, none of this would have
happened.

LUCIE. It was you who suggested it to me!

BRIGNAC. I know I did. All the stupid things I’ve done
in my life—not that there have been many—come from
my having too good a heart. All people from the South
have; we can’t think twice before doing a kindness. So
much the more reason why you should have looked after
her carefully.

LUCIE. Oh, it’s too much! When you yourself wanted
her to make friends with the Bernins!

BRIGNAC. Because I hoped that old Bernin would be
useful to us!

LUCIE. You always kept urging Annette to go to them.

BRIGNAC. So it’s all my fault, is it?

LUCIE. I don’t say that, but I must shew you that I’m
not so culpable as you make out. What are we going to
do?

BRIGNAC. In any case Annette can’t stay here.

289

LUCIE. Good heavens, where can she go? Madeleine
can’t have her. Perhaps our old nurse, Catherine—

BRIGNAC. If she went to Madeleine or Catherine, it
would be exactly as if we kept her here. The important
thing is that no one should know anything about it. She
must go to Paris, to some big town, till the birth of her
child.

LUCIE. It’s not possible.

BRIGNAC. The only thing not possible is to let it be
known, to keep her at Chartres. Can’t you imagine what
it would be like for her if we did? Think of her going to
a concert or to Mass when her condition became evident!
She wouldn’t be able to go out of the house without being
exposed to insult and insolence. And the way our
acquaintances would look at her! Why, it would be purgatory.

LUCIE. And everyone will welcome M. Jacques Bernin.

BRIGNAC. Of course they will. And when the child is
born, what then? I’m not thinking of the expense: fortunately
for her she has us to fall back on, so she wouldn’t
starve. Suppose she put the baby out to nurse? Afterwards
she’d have to keep it with her—imagine what people
would say! She might pay for it to be brought up
elsewhere, but that’s only a way of deserting it. She would
never be able to marry. All her life she would be a pariah.
No; the only thing is to send her away.

LUCIE. Send her away—where to?

BRIGNAC. How should I know? We’ll find some place.
There are places for that at Paris. Yes; I remember now,
special places. We’ll pay whatever is necessary. Establishments
where you’re not required to give your name
at all. The difficulty will be to find a plausible reason of
Annette’s absence. However, we’ll find one.

LUCIE. And the child?

BRIGNAC. The child? She can do what she likes with
that. You don’t suppose I’ll have it back here with her,
do you?

290

LUCIE. Then that’s what you’re proposing to do?

BRIGNAC. That’s what we must do.

LUCIE. How does one get into these places you were
speaking of?

BRIGNAC. I don’t know exactly. I’ll find out. Don’t
worry. If necessary, I’ll go to Paris and take the proper
steps. Of course without saying that it’s to do with anyone
I know.

LUCIE. Of course.

BRIGNAC. Of course.

LUCIE [rising and touching him on the shoulder as she
passes] You are a fine fellow.

BRIGNAC [modestly] Oh, come; only a little thought
was wanted.

LUCIE. I think you have no conscience at all.

BRIGNAC. What do you mean? You speak as if I were
a monster.

LUCIE. Nothing but respect for public opinion.

BRIGNAC. Respect for public opinion is one form of
conscience.

LUCIE. The conscience of people who haven’t got any!

BRIGNAC. Anyway, one can’t do anything else.

LUCIE. Can’t you imagine what my poor darling’s life
would be like if we did what you said? Turned out of
here—

BRIGNAC. No, no; not turned out.

LUCIE. Sent away unwillingly, if you like, coming to
this place, suddenly thrust into contact with all the sadness
and the misery and the vice of Paris! Think of her
waiting all those months, in the midst of the women
there, while a poor little creature is growing into life that
she knows beforehand is condemned to all the risks and
cruelty suffered by children whom their mothers abandon!
And when she is torn with the torturing pain that
I know so well, at that moment of martyrdom when a
woman feels death hovering over her bed and watching
jealously for mother and child, when the full horror of the291
sacred mystery she has accomplished is on her, then
she’ll only have strangers round her! And if her poor
eyes look round, like a victim’s, perhaps for the last time,
for a friendly glance, if she feels for a hand to press, she
will only see round her bed unknown men performing a
duty and women carrying on their trade. And then?
Then she must resist her highest instincts, stifle the cry
of love that consoles all women for what they have gone
through, and say she doesn’t want her child—look aside,
and say: ‘Take him away! I don’t want to see him.’
That’s the price for which she will be pardoned the crime
of someone else! That’s your justice! Justice! Social
hypocrisy rather—that’s what you stand up for. Nothing
but that. And that’s why, if Annette stayed to bring up
her child here, she would be an object of reproach; whereas,
if she is confined secretly in Paris and gets rid of the
baby, nobody will say anything. Let’s be frank about it.
If she had a lover, but no child, she would be let off. It
isn’t immorality that’s condemned, but having children!
You cry out for a higher birth rate, and at the same time
you say to women: ‘No children without marriage, and
no marriage without a dowry.’ Well, so long as you don’t
change that, all your circulars and your speeches will
only succeed in arousing laughter of pity and of rage!

BRIGNAC. Well, is it my fault?

LUCIE. No; it’s not your fault. It’s the fault of all of
us, of our prejudice, our silly vanity, our hypocrisy. But
you stand up for it all and justify it. You have the typical
window dressing, middle class virtues. You publicly
preach the repopulation of France, and then find it in
your conscience to get rid of a child whose only fault is
that its parents had it without first going through a stupid
ceremony, and without the whole town being told
that Monsieur X and Mademoiselle Y were going to bed
together! [A pause]. Go and make your speech. Go and
defend the morals of society. That’s about what you’re
worth.

292

Enter Madeleine.

MADELEINE. She’s not come back?

LUCIE. No. Haven’t you seen her?

MADELEINE. No.

BRIGNAC. Since you take it like that, then, you will
kindly find another home than my house for your sister
from now onwards.

LUCIE. Ah, yes; say it outright! You long to get rid of
her!

BRIGNAC [talking all the time while he goes into his study
and comes back with his portfolio, hat, and coat] I’m off.
It’s too much! Yes; I’m off! And for my part, I refuse to
be the victim of your sister’s pranks!

LUCIE [to herself] Wretch! wretch!

BRIGNAC. Do what you like, but I won’t have that sort
of thing here. [He goes out].

MADELEINE. I don’t know which way she went nor
where she is.

LUCIE. You’ve been to the Bernins?

MADELEINE. They were dining out.

LUCIE. Did they leave the town by an afternoon train?

MADELEINE. I don’t know.

LUCIE. Oh, I’m afraid.

MADELEINE. Annette must have known where they
were dining, because I got to their door before she had
time to get there herself.

LUCIE. You should have gone to the station.

MADELEINE. I made up my mind to, but then I saw that
I shouldn’t have time before the train went. So I thought
she must have come back.

LUCIE. Here she is! Thank God!

Enter Catherine and Annette.

CATHERINE. I will! I will tell! So as they may stop you
trying again.

Annette, her teeth clenched, her eyes fixed, shrugs her
shoulders. Throughout the ensuing scene no tear comes to
her eyes.

293

MADELEINE. In heaven’s name what has happened?

LUCIE. You’re here, you’re here! [She tries to take Annette
in her arms].

ANNETTE. Let me go! Let me go! [She picks up her
hat and coat, which she has thrown on to a chair, and sits
down, hard and reticent]

LUCIE. What is the matter? What have you done?

ANNETTE [in a broken voice] I wanted to put an end to
myself. Catherine stopped me.

LUCIE. To kill—

MADELEINE. Annette!

LUCIE. And us, had you forgotten us?

ANNETTE. My death would have brought less trouble
on you than my life will.

MADELEINE. Catherine, what has happened?

CATHERINE. I was getting out of the train. I saw her
start to throw herself under the wheels.

MADELEINE and LUCIE [terrified] Oh!

ANNETTE. You’ll be sorry one day you stopped me.

CATHERINE. You hear her! That’s the way she’s been
going on as we came back, all the time she was telling me
her story.

LUCIE. Swear you’ll never try again, Annette.

ANNETTE. How can I tell?

MADELEINE. Was she alone?

CATHERINE. No. When I saw her, she seemed to be
having a dispute with M. Bernin’s family. I stopped to
watch. Then M. Jacques got into the train and Annette
stood there crying; and just as the train went away, she
gave a cry and ran to try and throw herself under the
wheels. I caught her by her dress and brought her away;
and I wouldn’t leave her till I knew she was back here
and I had told you what she’d done.

ANNETTE. All right. Don’t let’s speak about it. I tried
to kill myself and I failed. If they saw me, no doubt they
shrugged their shoulders.

MADELEINE. You went to wait for them at the train?

294

ANNETTE. No. I knew where Jacques was dining—at
a restaurant—a farewell party. His parents were having
dinner at the station. I went to the restaurant and asked
for him, like a girl off the streets. I could hear his friends
laughing and joking from where I was, when the waiter
took my message.

LUCIE. Did he come?

ANNETTE. Yes. He told me afterwards he thought it
was some woman from a café chantant who sent for him.
Oh!

MADELEINE. And when he saw that it was you?

ANNETTE. He took me into the street, so that I shouldn’t
be recognized. That’s where we had our talk. The passers-by
laughed and made horrible jokes.

MADELEINE. And then you told him?

ANNETTE. Yes.

LUCIE. Well?

ANNETTE. You couldn’t guess what he answered: that
it wasn’t true.

LUCIE. Oh!

ANNETTE [still tearlessly] Then he lost his temper and
said he saw through my game; that I wanted to force
him to marry me because he was rich. Much he spared me!
I tried to put my arms round him: he threatened to call
the police. Then I cried, I implored him—I asked him to
come with me tomorrow to a doctor to prove I wasn’t lying.
He answered quite coldly that, even if it was true,
there was nothing to prove that it was him. Ah, you can’t
believe it, can you? It’s too much! I couldn’t have, unless
I had heard it with my own ears; and how I could
without dying I don’t know. You don’t know what depths
of shame and cowardice I sunk to. Then he looked at his
watch, saying he only had time to catch the train. He
said good bye and dashed off to the station. I had to half
run to keep up, crying, and begging him not to desert
me—for the sake of his child, of my happiness, my love, my
very life! Horrible! Horrible! Loathsome! And how295
ridiculous! I had him by the arm. I couldn’t believe
that was the end. At the entrance to the station he said,
brutally: ‘Let me go, will you?’ I said: ‘You shan’t go.’
Then he rushed to the train and got into the carriage,
nearly crushing my fingers in the door, and hid behind
his mother; and she threatened, too, to have me arrested.
Gabrielle sat there, looking white, and pretending not to
notice and not to know me. Catherine’s told you the rest.

A silence.

LUCIE. You must swear, Annette, never to think again
of suicide.

ANNETTE. I couldn’t swear sincerely.

MADELEINE. You must be brave, now that you know
what life is, brutally as it has been revealed to you. Almost
all the women you think happy have gone through
an inner catastrophe. They make themselves forget it
because their very tears give out. Suffering is reticent,
and they conceal theirs. But there are few women whose
lives have not been broken, few who don’t carry within
them the corpse of the woman they would have wished
to be.

ANNETTE. You say that to console me. I don’t believe
it.

MADELEINE. It’s the truth; and I’ve learnt it by experience.

ANNETTE. I’m tired of life. I feel as if I were a hundred.

LUCIE. Keep up your heart. We won’t desert you.

ANNETTE. What can you do? I shall be turned away
from here.

LUCIE. If you are, I’ll go with you.

ANNETTE. And your children?

LUCIE. I’ll take them, too.

ANNETTE. He’ll fetch them back. Besides, what should
we live on?

LUCIE. Ah!

ANNETTE. You see. You can’t do anything either,
Madeleine, for all your love. Your husband wouldn’t let296
you take me in. Nor you either, Catherine. You couldn’t
afford to. Well, then?

CATHERINE. Eh! eh!

Fresh silence.

ANNETTE. What a terrible thing life is!

MADELEINE. For all women.

ANNETTE. Not for anyone as much as for me.

MADELEINE. You think so, and that’s why you think of
dying. Well, I’m alive. You see me laughing now and
then. If you only knew!

CATHERINE. And what about about me, Annette?

ANNETTE. You have your children to console you.

CATHERINE. It’s they that make it hard for me.

ANNETTE. For other women it’s a refuge to have children.
What will it be for me?

MADELEINE. You think that I am happy, Annette?

ANNETTE. You have a husband who loves you, you’re
rich, you can afford to dress beautifully, you go everywhere,
and everyone wants to have you. That’s some
happiness, isn’t it?

MADELEINE. That’s all you see. If you only knew what
you don’t see!

CATHERINE. Do you think being a mother has made
me happy?

ANNETTE. I know you’re poor. You have to work, to
work hard, to bring up your children; but you can look
the world in the face and love them.

CATHERINE. If you knew!

MADELEINE. Then you must know! Even Lucie doesn’t
know what I’m going to say. You think I’m happy because
the money my godmother left me enabled me to
marry the man of my choice, a man who was well off.
Listen, then. My husband married me because I was
good looking. He wanted a son. I gave him one, but my
child cost me his love. You can’t be a wife and a mother
at the same time. I lost my elegant figure, I was ill, I
suffered the woes that woman’s flesh is heir to and—he297
left me for another woman! Don’t be too quick to condemn
worldly women who shrink from motherhood, Annette.
Man’s baseness is such that they must often choose
between their husbands and their children. And if some
choose their husband, let those who have never loved
throw the first stone at them! I felt that if I nursed my
baby I should lose my husband for good, and to win him
back I put my child out to nurse. He died, Annette; and
I have the agony of thinking that if I had kept him with
me he would be alive. Do you understand? It’s as if I
had killed him. Now I don’t mean to have another child.
I lead a worldly life, laughing, dining out, going to parties,
because that’s what my husband wants, and that’s
how he loves me. I shall have a lonely old age. My arms
are empty—mine, whose joy would have been to rock my
children to sleep in them—and I’m ashamed of what I’m
doing. I despise myself. You’d think I’d paid enough for
my husband’s love, wouldn’t you? Oh, no. He’s gone to
Paris, ostensibly on business, really to another woman.
I know it. I pretend not to know because I’m afraid of
forcing him to choose between her and me. That’s my
life, Annette. Many women whom you think happy live
like that.

ANNETTE. Poor Madeleine!

LUCIE. And I. One of my little girls is an invalid, the
other is ailing. Perhaps she’ll die.

CATHERINE. Two of mine died of want.

MADELEINE. I don’t want to have another child for fear
that my husband would leave me altogether. A divorce,
if I got one, would leave me a kind of half-widow and
make my girl an orphan.

CATHERINE. If I had any more, it would only mean
taking away food from those who haven’t enough as it is.

LUCIE. I’m guilty enough already. Two children of
suffering owe their existence to me.

MADELEINE. Think of my torture! I adore my husband:
when he comes back I long to feel myself in his arms
and I dread the consequences.

298

CATHERINE. Mine will leave me if I have another. And
then what would become of me, all alone with all my
children?

LUCIE. Your children who are grown up will support
you, Catherine.

CATHERINE. Those who are grown up! Grown up! I’ve
just been hearing about them. Edmond is in hospital,
ruined for life by going into what they call ‘a dangerous
trade’ because he couldn’t get work in any other. There
are too many workmen. My daughter, she’s on the streets.
[Sobbing] Oh, it’s too much! There’s too much misery
in the world!

MADELEINE. Yes, there’s too much misery!

ANNETTE. And I thought I was the most miserable!

LUCIE. There’s too much unhappiness!

CATHERINE. The children of poor folk are unhappy, all
of them, all.

ANNETTE. The child of an unmarried woman, too, is
born only to suffering.

LUCIE. Children who are born sickly or ill ought not to
be born at all.

CATHERINE. You see, Annette, we must bear it. God’s
given us eyes; it’s to cry with.

ANNETTE. To cry with!

The four women cry silently. Catherine is in Madeleine’s
arms. Lucie has her head on Annette’s lap.

CATHERINE [making ready to leave] Please to forgive
me.

MADELEINE. We have the same troubles.

ANNETTE. Yes; we have the same troubles.

CATHERINE. Yes; whether one’s rich or poor, when
one’s a woman—

Annette kisses Catherine. Catherine goes out.

MADELEINE. I must go, too. Your husband will be
coming back.

LUCIE [to herself, terrified] My husband coming back—coming
back!

299

ANNETTE. I won’t see him. Madeleine, you’re alone;
take me with you!

MADELEINE. Yes. You can come tomorrow, Lucie. We’ll
talk then.

LUCIE. Yes. [Suddenly] Here he is. Go out that way.

She pushes them out through Annette’s room. After a
moment Brignac comes in, flushed and happy.

BRIGNAC. What, still up! Aha, my dear, I’m going to
be elected! Absolutely certain, I tell you. Here, I’ve
brought you a bunch of roses.

LUCIE [without listening] Thank you. So you’re going
to turn Annette out?

BRIGNAC. I’m not turning her out. I simply ask her to
go somewhere else.

LUCIE. I shall go with her.

BRIGNAC. You’re going to leave me?

LUCIE. Yes.

BRIGNAC. You don’t love me any more, then?

LUCIE. No.

BRIGNAC. Ha. Another story beginning. Since when?

LUCIE. I’ve never loved you.

BRIGNAC. All the same you married me.

LUCIE. I didn’t love you.

BRIGNAC. This is nice news. Go on.

LUCIE. You’re only another victim of the morals you
were championing just now.

BRIGNAC. I don’t know what you mean.

LUCIE. When you asked me to marry you I was tired
of waiting in poverty for the man I could have loved. I
didn’t want to become an old maid. I took you, but I
knew you came to me because the girls with money
wouldn’t have you. You were on the shelf, too. I made
up my mind to try and love you loyally.

BRIGNAC. Well, then?

LUCIE. The first time I was going to have a child you
left me for other women. Since then I have only put up
with you. I was too cowardly not to. You may as well300
know it. I wanted my first child; the others I’ve had only
because you made me. Each time you left me—I was so
ugly! Yes; ugly through you! You left me at home, alone,
dreary, repulsive, to come back from the arms of some
prostitute, full of hypocritical solicitude for my health!
After the fatigue of nursing I begged for a rest, to have
a breathing space, so that I might have some life of my
own; and when I demanded only to have children at my
own wish, you laughed like a self-satisfied fool. Oh, your
fatuous pride, your base egoism, your utter want of
thought for the future of your children and the life of
your wife! So you forced on me the labor and the agony
and the danger of having another child. What did it
matter to you? It flattered your vanity to make merry
with your friends and give yourself the airs of a fine fellow.
Idiot!

BRIGNAC. I’ve had enough of this. You’re my wife!

LUCIE. I won’t be your wife any more. I won’t have
any more children.

BRIGNAC. Pray why?

LUCIE. Didn’t Dr. Hourtin tell you anything?

BRIGNAC. Yes. All right. I’ll do what he said. There,
does that content you? Come to bed.

LUCIE. No.

BRIGNAC. You haven’t looked at my roses. Come, isn’t
he a loving husband, your little Julien?

LUCIE. Leave me alone. You’re drunk.

BRIGNAC. You know I’m not. Come and give me a kiss!

LUCIE. You stink of alcohol. Let me go.

BRIGNAC [low] I want you. [He kisses her].

LUCIE [tearing herself away] Faugh! [She wipes her
mouth furiously].

BRIGNAC. Enough of that, do you hear? [He seizes
her brutally]. That’s enough.

LUCIE. You hurt me! Let me go.

BRIGNAC. Be kind now. How well you look when your
temper’s up! Pretty pet. Mustn’t be naughty. Come.

301

LUCIE. I won’t.

BRIGNAC. Then I’ll make you! [They struggle, with
low cries, panting].

LUCIE [at the end of her strength] I can’t! I can’t!

He puts her on a chair; then goes to open the door of the
bedroom and turns on the electric light. The bed is seen, a
vision of white sheets. Brignac comes to his wife.

LUCIE [mad with terror] The cave man! The cave man!

He seizes her. She gives a cry and faints. He carries
her towards the bedroom.


302

ACT III

The Cour d’Assises. Only two of the four sides of the
hall are visible. The footlights nearly correspond with a
line drawn diagonally across it. To the left and in front is
the seat of the Ministry of State. Further back, to the left,
the Court.

Facing the audience, successively, are seated counsel,
above them the defendants and, lastly, the gendarmes. In
the middle, in front of a table placed for exhibits in the case,
the witness stand.

To the right three or four benches for the accommodation
of the audience, but only a small part is visible. The jury,
which is unseen, is supposed to occupy the place of the
prompter’s box.

There are present the Advocate General, the President
of the Court and his assessors, counsel for the defence and
his learned friends. In the dock are Madame Thomas,
Marie Gaubert, Tupin (Catherine’s husband), Lucie,
guarded by gendarmes. Among the public Madame d’Amergueux,
Brignac, the clerk.

At the rise of the curtain Madame Thomas is standing
in the dock.

PRESIDENT [authoritatively, to counsel for the defence]
Maître Verdier, this is not the moment for you to address
the Court. And I take this occasion to warn you: I tell
you plainly I will use all the authority in my power to
prevent you from attempting to set up a theory of justification,
as I see you are about to do, for the crimes with
which the defendants are charged.

303

COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENCE. You are mistaken, President.
I have no intention of the sort. On the contrary,
I declare publicly that in my eyes abortion is a crime because
it destroys the existence of a creature virtually in
being. To allow it would infallibly lead to allowing infanticide.
But what I shall try to shew is that by not permitting
affiliation, and by not respecting all motherhood,
however it is caused, Society has lost the right to condemn
a crime rendered excusable by the hypocrisy of
its morals and the indifference of the law.

PRESIDENT. This is not the moment for your speech.
The defendant Thomas: we shall now pass to the second
part of your examination. [He hunts in his notes, says a
word or two in an undertone to the assessor on his right,
then to Madame Thomas] So you admit the abominable
crimes with which you are charged?

MME. THOMAS. I must admit them, as you have the
proofs.

PRESIDENT. And you feel no remorse for the lives of
human beings you have destroyed from the sole motive
of gain! The jury will appreciate your attitude.

COUNSEL. Except that you have spared them the
trouble!

PRESIDENT. Maître Verdier, I cannot hear you now.
[To Madame Thomas] You have crippled the work of
nature, you have offended against the principle of life,
and you never said to yourself that among the beings
you stifled before their birth might be one destined to
benefit humanity by his greatness. Did you? Well?

MME. THOMAS. No.

PRESIDENT. You did not say so. Very well.

MME. THOMAS. If I had thought about that, I should
have perhaps said that there was as much chance—more,
perhaps—that he might be a thief or a murderer.

PRESIDENT. Indeed! I will not argue with you; I am
not going to give you the chance to expound your criminal
ideas here.

304

MME. THOMAS. My counsel will do it better than me.

PRESIDENT. We’ll see about that.

COUNSEL [with a smile] It might, perhaps, be well for
you, President, not to contemn in advance the rights of
the defence.

PRESIDENT [irritated] Maître Verdier, you have no
right to address me! And you will be good enough to
moderate your expressions. I regret to say that from the
opening of this case you have adopted an attitude that
you can, perhaps, carry off at Paris, but that I shall certainly
not countenance here. Pray take notice of that.

COUNSEL. At the Paris bar—

PRESIDENT. I cannot hear you now.

COUNSEL. At the Paris—

PRESIDENT. I cannot hear you now! Kindly be seated.

MME. D’AMERGUEUX [among the public, to her neighbor,
M. de Forgeau] What an excellent judge M. Calvon is.
He is to dine with us tomorrow: I shall congratulate him.

M. DE FORGEAU. A judge of the old stamp.

MME. D’AMERGUEUX. He recognizes us. Did you see
him give a little nod? [She directs her smiles at the President].

M. DE FORGEAU. Yes. Hush.

PRESIDENT. Marie Gaubert, stand up. [A thin little
woman rises to her feet]. Your name is Marie Gaubert.
How old are you?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. Twenty-seven.

PRESIDENT. Profession?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. Schoolmistress.

PRESIDENT. Do you admit the facts with which you are
charged?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. Yes.

PRESIDENT. What have you to say in your defence?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. I didn’t think I was doing wrong.

PRESIDENT. Your levity astounds me. You are a schoolmistress,
and you do not understand that the sacred mission
entrusted to you of preparing men and women for305
the glory and responsibility of the future entails on you
the duty of giving an example yourself! It is your business
to conduct the course of elementary instruction in
civic morality, and this is how you practise it! Have you
nothing to answer? According to my notes you undertook
the nursing of your two children yourself. Do you
love them?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. It was just because I loved them.

PRESIDENT. But you decided that two were enough.
You made up your mind to limit the work of the Almighty.

SCHOOLMISTRESS. I should have asked nothing better
than to have four or five children.

PRESIDENT. Indeed! Then let me tell you that you did
not take the best means to arrive at that result. [He
laughs and looks at his assessor on the right, then at
Madame d’Amergueux. She signals her congratulations
to him].

SCHOOLMISTRESS. You have to be able to feed your
children.

PRESIDENT. Ah, there! No! At a pinch I could understand
that excuse—a very bad one—being employed in
the case of other women; but not in yours, who enjoy the
incomparable advantage of being protected by the State.
You are never out of work.

SCHOOLMISTRESS. I earn eighty-three francs a month.
My husband, who is a teacher, too, gets as much. That
makes a hundred and sixty-six francs a month to live on
and bring up two children. When there were four of us,
we could almost do it; with five it would have been impossible.

PRESIDENT. You omit to say that during your confinement
you have the right to a month’s leave with full
salary.

SCHOOLMISTRESS. That used to be true, President. It
is so no longer. A departmental circular of 1900 informed
us that the funds were insufficient for more than half sal306aries
to be paid, as a rule, at such times. To obtain the
whole salary, a detailed report from the inspector is required,
and you must petition for it.

PRESIDENT. Then why not petition?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. It’s hard to seem like a beggar simply
because you have feelings.

PRESIDENT. Proud, are you?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. There’s no law against that.

PRESIDENT. So that is why you went to the defendant
Thomas?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. Yes, sir. My husband and I arranged
our little finances so: the evening our salaries were paid
we used to divide the money into different parts and put
them by; so much for rent, so much for food, so much for
clothing. We just managed to get along by calculating
carefully, and more than once having to cut down expenses
that seemed inevitable. The prospect of a third
child upset everything. It made our existence impossible.
We should have all gone hungry. And then the inspectors
and the head mistresses don’t like you to have many
children, especially if you nurse them yourself. The last
time I was nursing I was made to hide myself—I only had
ten minutes during the break at ten o’clock and again at
two; and when my mother brought the baby, I had to
take him into a dark closet.

PRESIDENT. That has nothing to do with it.

COUNSEL. Yes, President, it has. It ought to be known
how the State, which preaches the increase of the population,
treats its servants when they have children.

PRESIDENT [furiously] I can’t hear you now! [To the
schoolmistress] You haven’t anything more to say?

SCHOOLMISTRESS. No, sir.

PRESIDENT. Sit down.

MME. D’AMERGUEUX. I think M. Calvon lets their counsel
talk too much.

M. DE FORGEAU. He’s rather afraid of him.

PRESIDENT. Tupin, stand up.

307

TUPIN [a man of mean and wretched appearance] After
you, Calvon.

PRESIDENT. What’s that?

TUPIN. I said, ‘After you, Calvon.’ That’s your name,
isn’t it?

PRESIDENT. I warn you I shall not stand the least insolence
from you.

TUPIN. I said, ‘After you, Calvon,’ just as you said,
’Stand up Tupin.’ If that’s insolence, I didn’t begin it.

PRESIDENT. I will have you removed. Stand up.

TUPIN. All right. It’ll let me stretch my legs a bit.

PRESIDENT. Your profession?

TUPIN. Electrician.

PRESIDENT. You were once. It’s a long time since you
worked regularly.

TUPIN. There’s no work to be had.

PRESIDENT. Because you look for it at the wineshop.
The police give the worst account of you.

TUPIN. I am not surprised they don’t like me: I never
liked them. [Laughter].

PRESIDENT. Silence there: or I shall have the court
cleared. [To Tupin] The name of your wife has been
found among the papers of the defendant Thomas.
Catherine Tupin, maiden name Bidois. Where is Catherine
Tupin? Stand up. Very well, sit down again. [To
Tupin] You tried to conceal your wife from the police.

TUPIN. I didn’t think they were good company for her.

PRESIDENT [pretending not to hear] You then gave
yourself up on your own confession that it was you who
took her to this abominable woman’s house.

TUPIN. You speak like a book.

PRESIDENT. You persisted in the confession of your
guilt. Did you want to go to prison?

TUPIN. Why, that’s an idea! You get fed and sheltered
there anyway.

PRESIDENT. The prison conditions are certainly better
than those you are accustomed to.

308

TUPIN. Now you’re talking.

PRESIDENT. When you were arrested you were completely
destitute. The remains of your furniture had been
sold, and you were on the eve of finding yourself without
a roof over your head. Doubtless you will blame Society,
too. Your insubordinate character leads you to
frequent Socialist clubs; and when you do not affect, as
you do now, a cynical carelessness in your speech, you
are used to repeat the empty phrases you have learnt
from the propagandist pamphlets that poison the minds
of the working classes. But we know you. If you are a
victim, it is to your own vices. You are a hardened
drinker.

TUPIN. Lately, that’s true.

PRESIDENT. You admit it. Extraordinary!

TUPIN. What’s that prove?

PRESIDENT. Your eldest daughter is known to the
police of Paris as a prostitute. One of your sons has been
sentenced to a year’s imprisonment for theft. Is that
true?

TUPIN. Possibly.

PRESIDENT. A little less proud now? That’s right. Well,
now, you took your wife to this woman. Why?

TUPIN. Because I thought it was enough to have
brought seven wretched creatures into the world.

PRESIDENT. If you had continued to be the honest and
industrious workman you were once, you might have
had another child without its necessarily growing up
wretched.

TUPIN. No, sir. Not with five. It’s impossible.

PRESIDENT. I don’t understand.

TUPIN. I say that a working man’s family, however
much they work and economize, can’t support itself
when there are five children.

PRESIDENT. If that is true, there are—and it is to the
credit of the Society that you despise—there are, I say,
numerous charitable organizations which are, so to speak,309
on the watch for the victims of misfortune and make it a
point of honor to leave none without succor.

TUPIN [excitedly] Oh, and that seems all right to you,
that a working man, who hasn’t any vice and does his
duty, which is to work and—we’re told, too—have plenty
of children, it seems all right to you that that should simply
lead to beggary.

PRESIDENT. Yes, yes; I recognize the wineshop orator.
So you say that a household can’t exist with five children.
Thank God, there is more than one in that condition
which goes neither to ask for charity nor to an abortionist.

MME. TUPIN. You’re wrong.

TUPIN. Shall I prove that you’re wrong?

PRESIDENT. That doesn’t seem to me to have much to
do with the case.

MME. TUPIN. Yes, it has.

TUPIN. Pardon me. If I prove it, people will understand
how I came to do what I did.

PRESIDENT. Very well. But be short.

TUPIN. I’ve given my counsel my accounts for a month.
Let him read it to you.

PRESIDENT. Very well. [The counsel rises].

COUNSEL. Here it is.

PRESIDENT. You are not Tupin’s counsel.

COUNSEL. No, President, but my learned friends have
done me the honor—for which I thank them—to confide
to me the task of dealing in my speech with the case
as a whole, reserving to themselves to deal with particular
aspects of it as they relate to their clients.

PRESIDENT. I will hear you now solely for the purpose
of reading these accounts. But this is not the time for you
to address the court. You understand: I will hear the accounts
and nothing more?

COUNSEL. Certainly, President. [He reads] The daily
nourishment of five children consists of a four-pound loaf,
soup of vegetables and dripping, and a stew which costs
ninety centimes. Total, 3f. 75c. This is the expenditure310
of the father: Return ticket for tram, 30c. Tobacco, 15c.
Dinner, 1f. 25c. The rent is 300f. Clothing for the whole
family, and boots: sixteen pairs of boots for the children
at 4f. 50c. each, four for the parents at 8f.: total again, 300f.
Total for the year: 2,600f. The expenditure then must
be set down at 2,600f. Tupin, who is an exceptional
workman, earned 160f. a month, that is to say, 2,100f. a
year. There is therefore an annual deficit of 500f. As I
have promised, I will not add a word. [He sits down].

MME. D’AMERGUEUX [to her husband] He might well
have saved the three sous a day for tobacco.

COUNSEL. Does the Court wish to have this paper put in?

PRESIDENT. There is no object in that. [To Tupin] I
will not quarrel with your figures: I accept them. But I
repeat: there are charitable institutions.

TUPIN. And I repeat that I don’t want to beg.

PRESIDENT. You prefer to commit what is almost infanticide?
A man whose daughter is on the streets and
whose son is a thief can accept charity without degradation.

TUPIN [excited] They weren’t then. If they’ve fallen
to that, it’s because with so many other children besides, I
couldn’t look after my son as rich people look after theirs,
and because my daughter was seduced and abandoned—because
she was hungry! No, but you must have a heart
of stone to bring that up against me!

PRESIDENT. And it’s not your fault either that you’ve
become a drunkard?

TUPIN. I’ll tell you. You know the proverb: ‘When
there’s no hay in the manger—.’ Well, when the pinch
came at home, I and my wife began to quarrel over each
new baby. Each of us accused the other of having made
things worse for the first ones. Well, I’ll cut it short. If
I went to the wineshop, why, it’s warm there, and you
don’t hear the brats crying and their mother complaining.
And the drink helps you to forget, so it does, to
forget!

311

MME. TUPIN. It’s good to forget, so it is!

TUPIN. It’s my fault if you like, but that’s how we got
poorer and poorer.

PRESIDENT. And when you had your last child, didn’t
that serve as a lesson to you?

TUPIN. The last one didn’t cost anything.

PRESIDENT [absently] Ah!

TUPIN. He came into the world deformed and sickly.
He was conceived in misery, in want—his mother was
worn out.

PRESIDENT. And his father a drunkard!

TUPIN. If you like. Well, he came badly into the world—he
could never have been anything but a cripple. But
he didn’t want for anything! They took him in at the
hospital and begged me to let him stay there.

MME. TUPIN. He was a curiosity for the doctors.

TUPIN. They looked after him, I tell you. They didn’t
leave him for a minute. He was made to live in spite of
himself, so to speak. The other children, who were strong,
they let them perish of want. With half the care and
the money that was spent on the sickly one they might
have made fine fellows of all the rest.

PRESIDENT. Then that is why you made away with the
next?

TUPIN. For all the good he’d have had in the world,
if he could, he’d say, thank you.

PRESIDENT. You ought not to have had him.

TUPIN. That’s true. But we poor folk, we don’t know
the dodges rich people have so as only to have the children
they want, and take their fun all the same: worse
luck!

PRESIDENT. If everyone was of your opinion our country
would be in a bad way. But your country, doubtless, is
nothing to you?

TUPIN. I’ve heard say: ‘A man’s country is where he
is well off.’ I’m badly off everywhere.

PRESIDENT. And you are equally lost to any interest in
humanity.

312

TUPIN. If humanity can’t get on without a set of wretches
like me, let it go smash!

PRESIDENT. Well, the jury can estimate your sense of
morality. You may sit down.

Night has come. The ushers bring lamps.

MME. D’AMERGUEUX. I shouldn’t like to meet that man
of an evening in a lonely place.

M. DE FORGEAU. Nor I. Now for Madame Brignac—that
was. My dear lady, what a dreadful thing!

MME. D’AMERGUEUX. Dreadful!

PRESIDENT. We have now only to examine the facts
concerning Lucie and Annette Jarras. [To the defendant
Thomas] Stand up. This girl, Annette Jarras, was your
victim. What have you to say?

MME. THOMAS. Nothing.

PRESIDENT. You don’t trouble yourself about it? Well,
we know your heart is not easy to move.

MME. THOMAS. If I told you that I was led to do what I
did by pity, you wouldn’t believe me.

PRESIDENT. Probably not. But you can try to make us
believe. The defendant has the right to say whatever he
thinks fit—always under the control of the court, of
course.

MME. THOMAS. It’s not worth while.

PRESIDENT. Yes, yes; go on. The jury is listening to you.

MME. THOMAS [on a sign from her counsel] A girl came
to me one day. She was a servant. Her master had had
her. I refused to do what she asked me: she went away
and threw herself into the water. Another, whom I
wouldn’t help, was tried here for infanticide. So, since
then, when others have come to me, I have agreed; I
have prevented more than one suicide and more than one
crime.

PRESIDENT. So it was from pity, out of charity that you
acted. The prosecution will reply that you never forgot
to exact heavy payment.

MME. THOMAS. And you, aren’t you paid for condemning
others?

313

PRESIDENT. Those whom you condemned to death and
executed yourself, were innocent.

MME. THOMAS. You prosecute me; but the surgeons who
guarantee sterility get decorated!

PRESIDENT. You forget this young girl who died as the
result of your action, Annette Jarras. She was eighteen,
in the full enjoyment of health; now she is in the grave.
[Lucie breaks into sobs] Look at her sister by your side;
listen to her crying. Ask her now if she does not curse you.

MME. THOMAS. She would bless me if I had succeeded.

PRESIDENT [to Lucie] Defendant Lucie Jarras, stand up.

M. DE FORGEAU [to his neighbor] Brignac must think
himself lucky to have got his divorce.

MME. D’AMERGUEUX. Speak lower; he’s behind us. I am
against divorce, but in this case—

PRESIDENT. You have heard the defendant Thomas.
What have you to say?

LUCIE [through her sobs] Nothing. Nothing. [She
sinks back upon her bench].

PRESIDENT. Do you admit—?

LUCIE. Yes, yes; I admit everything. I’ve told you so
already.

PRESIDENT. You did not want your child to come into
the world?

LUCIE. I didn’t want it to.

PRESIDENT. Why?

LUCIE. Out of pity for him. I knew what sort of a life
he would have, and I risked my own to save him from it.
I acted like a good mother.

PRESIDENT. What you say is simply monstrous. [Silence].
You, now, have not the excuse of poverty. Your
child would not have suffered from want.

LUCIE. He would have suffered from disease, and that
is as bad as want.

PRESIDENT. No theories, please. Only facts.

LUCIE. Yes; facts, nothing but facts. You can see the
theory of it for yourself. I had two children, two little314
girls. One is a deaf mute, the other had convulsions.
She is dead now. The doctors told me that that was due
to the alcoholized condition of my husband, whose father
had been in the same state.

PRESIDENT. Most unfortunate.

LUCIE. Be pleased to let me speak!

PRESIDENT. Very good. I will answer you.

LUCIE. One of the doctors is famous—Dr. Hourtin.

PRESIDENT. A specialist who sees alcoholism everywhere!

LUCIE [more vigorously] Those doctors told me that if
my husband did not change his mode of life, any further
children I had by him would, perhaps, be worse than the
first, nervous degenerates. The very evening that Professor
Hourtin came to see me, my husband came back
from some festivity in a state of excitement—[She stops].

PRESIDENT. Well? Is that all?

LUCIE. No; I’ll have the courage to say everything. I
have nothing to lose now.

PRESIDENT. Please take note that it is not I who make
you go on.

LUCIE. No; you would probably prefer if I didn’t.
[Controlling her voice] During the day something had
happened—something serious—that revealed to me all
the hideousness of his moral character. I determined no
longer to be his wife. He came in, gay with drinking. In
spite of my prayers and resistance, my cries of hatred and
disgust, he chose that evening to exercise his rights—his
rights! He took me by force; he outraged me.

PRESIDENT. He was your husband?

LUCIE. Yes.

PRESIDENT. Then—

LUCIE. Of course. The next morning I left his house.

PRESIDENT [starting] M. Brignac is not in question.

LUCIE. I bring him in question!

PRESIDENT. I shall not allow you to bring charges
against persons unconnected with the case.

315

LUCIE. He ought to be in my place.

PRESIDENT. His name does not figure in the indictment.

LUCIE. Because your justice doesn’t want to put responsibility
on the right shoulders!

PRESIDENT. I forbid you to speak like that of M. Brignac.

COUNSEL. Pardon me, President.

PRESIDENT. I cannot hear you now.

COUNSEL. That is why I ask to be heard.

PRESIDENT. What do you want?

COUNSEL. M. Brignac is called as a witness.

PRESIDENT. We have already heard him.

COUNSEL. Allow me to remind you of the terms of Article
319 of the Criminal Code, which authorizes me to
say against him as well as against his evidence whatever
may help the defence.

PRESIDENT. And let me remind you of Article 311 in
the same Code, which enjoins you to express yourself
with moderation.

COUNSEL. I ask you, President, kindly to recall M.
Brignac to the bar. I have a question to put to him
through you.

PRESIDENT [after consulting with his assessors] Usher,
ask M. Brignac kindly to come here.

BRIGNAC [coming forward to the bar] Here, President.

PRESIDENT. What is your question, Maître Verdier?

COUNSEL. M. Brignac has heard all that has just been
said?

BRIGNAC. Yes.

COUNSEL. Then I beg M. Brignac to review all the factors
in his memory. I make a supreme appeal to his conscience,
and I beg you, President, to put this question to
M. Brignac: does M. Brignac not recognize himself as
morally responsible for the crime imputed to Madame
Lucie Jarras, his divorced wife?

PRESIDENT. I shall not put the question. Is that all?

316

COUNSEL. For the moment, yes.

PRESIDENT [to Brignac] You may return to your place,
Deputy. But since the defence, with an assumption of
excessive liberty, appears desirous of incriminating you,
the Court may, perhaps, be permitted to express to you
here the high esteem in which it personally holds you.
[He half rises from his chair, bowing to Brignac].

BRIGNAC. I thank you, President. [He goes back to his
place].

MME. D’AMERGUEUX [to her neighbor] Then it’s true what
they say, that Brignac is to be Minister of Justice in the
next Government?

PRESIDENT [to Lucie] Defendant Jarras, have you finished?

LUCIE. No, President.

PRESIDENT [with a gesture of weariness] Go on, then;
I’m listening.

LUCIE. When I felt a child coming to life within me of
a man who was nothing more to me, whose name even I
no longer bore, and whom I hated with my whole soul,
I prevented it from being born to a destiny of misery. I
consider that I had the right to refuse the task of motherhood
when it was forced on me against my will.

PRESIDENT. I shall not allow you to justify an act which
is a crime by law.

LUCIE. I have nothing on my conscience to reproach
myself with.

PRESIDENT. Then you have a singularly indulgent conscience.
All this comes from your pride. If you had not
entered into a struggle with your husband, you would
still bear a respected name and you would not be there.

LUCIE. I knew that any child of his would be a degenerate.
Had I not the right to refuse?

PRESIDENT. No.

LUCIE. I loved him no longer. Had I not the right to
refuse?

PRESIDENT. No.

317

LUCIE. Well, then, have the courage to say that woman
in the marriage of today is a slave whom man can reduce
to be the instrument of his pleasure! Just as he likes he
can leave her sterile or give her children—imperil her
happiness, her life, or her health, and pledge her whole
future without having to render more account to her than
a bull who is put to a cow! If that’s it, very well! But say
so! At least, let innocent girls know the shameful bargain
that men offer them, with love for a bait and the law for
a trap!

PRESIDENT [coldly] You were the cause of your young
sister’s death. You took her with you.

LUCIE [calmer] Yes. [She stops].

PRESIDENT. Well?

LUCIE. Our money was soon spent. Annette got some
music lessons to give, but they sent her away when they
found out her condition. I did sewing.

PRESIDENT. Then you earned some money.

LUCIE. I could not get work every day. When I did, I
earned fifteen sous for twelve hours. It’s true I was not
clever; there are women who earn one franc twenty-five-.
We were seized by despair at the thought of the child that
was coming.

PRESIDENT. That was not a reason to take your sister
and her child to their deaths. [Lucie is seized by a nervous
shudder and does not answer] Answer me.

COUNSEL. Let her take a minute, President.

LUCIE [pulling herself together] I wanted to get her into
a hospital, but they only take you in at the end of pregnancy.
At Paris there are institutions, it seems, but not
in the provinces.

PRESIDENT. You might have asked for relief.

LUCIE. We had not been the requisite six months in the
town. And afterwards, what could we have done with the
child?

PRESIDENT. If she was unable to bring it up, your sister
could have taken it to the ‘Enfants Assistés.’

318

LUCIE. Yes, abandoned it. We did think of that. We
made inquiries.

COUNSEL. A certificate is required that the applicant to
the society is without means. An inquiry is made and the
application may be accepted or refused. In the meantime
the child may die.

LUCIE. They only take in children on condition that
the mother shall not know where the child is, that she
shall never see it or have news of it. Once a month only
she is told if it is alive or dead; nothing more.

PRESIDENT. Go on, madam. But facts, if you please.

LUCIE. Yes. I begged my husband to take Annette and
me back. He would not.

PRESIDENT. Kindly come to the defendant Thomas.

LUCIE [with constantly rising emotion] Annette reproached
herself for having accepted what she called my
sacrifice. She said that she was the cause of all my trouble.
[Pause] One day I was fetched; I found her dead at this
woman’s. [A fit of sobbing seizes her: her nerves break
down completely. She cries] My little sister! my poor little
sister!

PRESIDENT [Compassionately, to the usher] Take her
away. Call the doctor. [Lucie, still crying out, is led away.
Her emotion has communicated itself to everyone in court.
The President continues to the defendants] Has no one else
among you anything further to say in his defence?

TUPIN [excited] Oh, if we said everything we should
be here till tomorrow!

MME. TUPIN [equally excited] Yes, till tomorrow, so we
should!

TUPIN. And then we shouldn’t be done, I can tell you!

PRESIDENT. Then I will hear the Advocate-General.

SCHOOLMISTRESS. But you’re not going to condemn us?
It isn’t possible. I haven’t said everything—

TUPIN. It’s not we who are guilty!

SCHOOLMISTRESS. I was afraid of getting a bad name.
We hadn’t the means, either, to bring up another.

319

MME. TUPIN [greatly worked up] So that’s it! So that’s
all the children that we bring up get by it! What’s the
use of talking? The men haven’t thought of changing
it—well then, we must do it! We women! We must
strike! We—the mothers! The great strike—the strike
of the mothers!

Cries among the public, ‘Yes, yes.’

PRESIDENT. Silence!

MME. TUPIN. What’s the good of using ourselves up to
make more wretched men and gay women! For others
to use!

TUPIN. It’s not we that are guilty!

PRESIDENT. Sit down!

TUPIN [drowning his voice] It’s the men who’ve not
given us enough to feed our children that are guilty!

PRESIDENT. Sit down!

TUPIN. The men who tell us to have other children,
while those we have are rotting with hunger!

COUNSEL. The criminal is the man who seduced little
Annette!

PRESIDENT. Silence!

MME. THOMAS. Yes, where’s he? Where’s he? You
haven’t taken him up! Because he’s a man and your laws—

PRESIDENT. Guards!

MME. THOMAS. And your laws are made by men!

PRESIDENT. Guards!

MME. THOMAS. And all the men who got with child the
girls I delivered, did you prosecute them?

During the following, an anger which becomes a fury
seizes the accused. They are all on their feet, except the
schoolmistress, who continues to sob and utter words that no
one hears. The President is also on his feet; he tries vainly
to restore silence by knocking on his desk with a paper-knife,
but he cannot make himself heard. The tumult increases
till the fall of the curtain, the voices of the counsel for the
defence and his clients drowning those of the President and
the Procuror.

320

PRESIDENT. I will have you removed to prison!

MME.THOMAS. The fine gentlemen who take mistresses!
And the young ones who humbug little work girls!

PRESIDENT. I’ll have you removed to prison.

PROCUROR. Guards, can’t you keep that crowd of fanatics
quiet?

COUNSEL. You have no right to insult the defendants!

TUPIN. That’s all they’ve done from the beginning!

PROCUROR. Make that howling mob be quiet! The defendants
have no respect for the Court!

COUNSEL. And you, Advocate General, have no respect
for justice!

PROCUROR. If their crime inspires you with sympathy,
it only fills me with indignation.

COUNSEL. They are right. They are not guilty! The respect
that you lack—

PROCUROR. I demand—

COUNSEL. The guilt is at the door of the morals that
brand the unmarried mother.

THE PUBLIC. Bravo!

PROCUROR. I ask that counsel for the defence—

COUNSEL. Every woman with child ought to be respected
in whatever circumstances her child has come into
being.

Applause.

PRESIDENT. Maître Verdier, by virtue of Article 43 of
the Rules—

COUNSEL. Their crime is not an individual, but a social,
crime.

PROCUROR. It is a crime against nature!

COUNSEL. It is not a crime; it is a revolt against nature!

PRESIDENT. Guards, remove the defendants! [The
guards do not hear or do not understand]. Maître Verdier,
if I have to employ force—

Tumult in court.

COUNSEL [succeeding by the force of his voice in imposing
a short silence] It is a revolt against nature! A revolt that321
fills my heart with pity, at the cause of which all the force
of my mind is roused to indignation! Yes; I look forward
with eagerness to that hour of freedom when the store-house
of science shall give to everyone the means, without
a restraint that is only hypocrisy, without the profanation
of love, to have none but the children he wants!
That will be indeed a victory over nature, that cruel nature
which sows with criminal profusion the life that she
watches die with indifference. But meanwhile—

The tumult begins again.

PRESIDENT. Guards, clear the court! Guards! Guards,
remove the defendants. The sitting is adjourned.

The judges put on their caps and rise.

MME. THOMAS. It’s not me who kills the innocents! I’m
no murderess!

SCHOOLMISTRESS. Mercy! Mercy!

MME. TUPIN. She’s no murderess!

TUPIN. She’s right. She’s no murderess!

MME. THOMAS. It’s the men that are guilty! The men!
All the men!

The judges leave by the narrow door leading to their
room. During the last words their red robes are seen gradually
disappearing.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
