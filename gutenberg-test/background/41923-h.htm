        aspects with Adonis and Attis as a personification of the great
        yearly vicissitudes of nature, especially of the corn. But the
        immense vogue which he enjoyed for many ages induced his devoted
        worshippers to heap upon him the attributes and powers of many other
        gods; so that it is not always easy to strip him, so to say, of his
        borrowed plumes and to restore them to their proper owners. In the
        following pages I do not pretend to enumerate and analyse all the
        alien elements which thus gathered round the popular deity. All that
        I shall attempt to do is to peel off these accretions and to exhibit
        the god, as far as possible, in his primitive simplicity. The
        discoveries of recent years in Egypt enable us to do so with more
        confidence now than when I first addressed myself to the problem many
        years ago.</p>

        myth or legend of Osiris the oldest are a long series of hymns,
        prayers, incantations, and liturgies, which have been found engraved
        in hieroglyphics on the walls, passages, and galleries of five
        pyramids at Sakkara. From the place where they were discovered these
        ancient religious records are known as the Pyramid Texts. They date
        from the fifth and sixth dynasties, and the period of time during
        which they were carved on the pyramids is believed to have been
        roughly a hundred and fifty years from about the year 2625
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> onward. But from their
        contents it appears that many of these documents were drawn up much
        earlier; for in some of them there are references to works which have
        perished, and in others there are political allusions which seem to
        show that the passages containing them must have been composed at a
        time when the Northern and Southern Kingdoms were still independent
        and hostile states and had not yet coalesced into a single realm
        under the sway of one powerful monarch. As the union of the kingdoms
        appears to have taken place about three thousand four hundred years
        before our era, the whole period covered by the composition of the
        Pyramid Texts probably did not fall short of a thousand years. Thus
        the documents form the oldest body of religious literature surviving
        to us from the ancient world, and occupy a place in the history of
        Egyptian language and civilization like that which the Vedic hymns
        and incantations occupy in the history of Aryan speech and
        culture.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The special

        them all is an insistent, a passionate protest against the reality of
        death: indeed the word death never occurs in the Pyramid Texts except
        to be scornfully denied or to be applied to an enemy. Again and again
        the indomitable assurance is repeated that the dead man did not die
        but lives. <span class="tei tei-q">“King Teti has not died the death,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is
        significant that in these ancient documents, though the myth or
        legend of Osiris is not set forth at length, it is often alluded to
        as if it were a matter of common knowledge. Hence we may legitimately
        infer the great antiquity of the Osirian tradition in Egypt. Indeed
        so numerous are the allusions to it in the Pyramid Texts that by
        their help we could reconstruct the story in its main outlines even

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Osiris was the
        offspring of an intrigue between the earth-god Seb (Keb or Geb, as
        the name is sometimes transliterated) and the sky-goddess Nut. The
        Greeks identified his parents with their own deities Cronus and Rhea.
        When the sun-god Ra perceived that his wife Nut had been unfaithful
        to him, he declared with a curse that she should be delivered of the
        child in no month and no year. But the goddess had another lover, the
        god Thoth or Hermes, as the Greeks called him, and he playing at
        draughts with the moon won from her a seventy-second part<a id=

        day, and having compounded five whole days out of these parts he
        added them to the Egyptian year of three hundred and sixty days. This
        was the mythical origin of the five supplementary days which the
        Egyptians annually inserted at the end of every year in order to
        establish a harmony between lunar and solar time.<a id="noteref_6"

        five days, regarded as outside the year of twelve months, the curse
        of the sun-god did not rest, and accordingly Osiris was born on the
        first of them. At his nativity a voice rang out proclaiming that the
        Lord of All had come into the world. Some say that a certain Pamyles
        heard a voice from the temple at Thebes bidding him announce with a
        shout that a great king, the beneficent Osiris, was born. But Osiris
        was not the only child of his mother. On the second of the
        supplementary days she gave birth to the elder Horus, on the third to
        the god Set, whom the Greeks called Typhon, on the fourth to the
        goddess Isis, and on the fifth to the goddess Nephthys.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reigning as a king
        on earth, Osiris reclaimed the Egyptians from savagery, gave them
        laws, and taught them to worship the gods. Before his time the
        Egyptians had been cannibals. But Isis, the sister and wife of
        Osiris, discovered wheat and barley growing wild, and Osiris
        introduced the cultivation of these grains amongst his people, who
        forthwith abandoned cannibalism and took kindly to a corn diet.
        Moreover, Osiris is said to have been the first to gather fruit from
        trees, to train the vine to poles, and to tread the grapes. Eager to
        communicate these beneficent discoveries to all mankind, he committed
        the whole government of Egypt to his wife Isis, and travelled over
        the world, diffusing the blessings of civilization and agriculture
        wherever he went. In countries where a harsh climate or niggardly
        soil forbade the cultivation of the vine, he taught the inhabitants
        to console themselves for the want of wine by brewing beer from
        barley. Loaded with the wealth that had been showered upon him by
        grateful nations, he returned to Egypt, and on account of the
        benefits he had conferred on mankind he was unanimously hailed and
        worshipped as a deity.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=
        "#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        brother Set (whom the Greeks called Typhon) with seventy-two others
        plotted against him. Having taken the measure of his good brother's
        body by stealth, the bad brother Typhon fashioned and highly
        decorated a coffer of the same size, and once when they were all
        drinking and making merry he brought in the coffer and jestingly
        promised to give it to the one whom it should fit exactly. Well, they
        all tried one after the other, but it fitted none of them. Last of
        all Osiris stepped into it and lay down. On that the conspirators ran
        and slammed the lid down on him, nailed it fast, soldered it with
        molten lead, and flung the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg

        month Athyr, when the sun is in the sign of the Scorpion, and in the
        eight-and-twentieth year of the reign or the life of Osiris. When
        Isis heard of it she sheared off a lock of her hair, put on mourning
        attire, and wandered disconsolately up and down, seeking the
        body.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the advice of
        the god of wisdom she took refuge in the papyrus swamps of the Delta.
        Seven scorpions accompanied her in her flight. One evening when she
        was weary she came to the house of a woman, who, alarmed at the sight
        of the scorpions, shut the door in her face. Then one of the
        scorpions crept under the door and stung the child of the woman that
        he died. But when Isis heard the mother's lamentation, her heart was
        touched, and she laid her hands on the child and uttered her powerful
        spells; so the poison was driven out of the child and he lived.
        Afterwards Isis herself gave birth to a son in the swamps. She had
        conceived him while she fluttered in the form of a hawk over the
        corpse of her dead husband. The infant was the younger Horus, who in
        his youth bore the name of Harpocrates, that is, the child Horus. Him
        Buto, the goddess of the north, hid from the wrath of his wicked
        uncle Set. Yet she could not guard him from all mishap; for one day
        when Isis came to her little son's hiding-place she found him
        stretched lifeless and rigid on the ground: a scorpion had stung him.
        Then Isis prayed to the sun-god Ra for help. The god hearkened to her
        and staid his bark in the sky, and sent down Thoth to teach her the
        spell by which she might restore her son to life. She uttered the
        words of power, and straightway the poison flowed from the body of
        Horus, air passed into him, and he lived. Then Thoth ascended up into
        the sky and took his place once more in the bark of the sun, and the

        away out to sea, till at last it drifted ashore at Byblus, on the
        coast of Syria. Here a fine <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">erica</span></span>-tree
        shot up suddenly and enclosed the chest in its trunk. The king of the
        country, admiring the growth of the tree, had it cut down and made
        into a pillar of his house; but he did not know that the coffer with
        the dead Osiris was in it. Word of this came to Isis and she
        journeyed to Byblus, and sat down by the well, in humble guise, her
        face wet with tears. To none would she speak till the king's
        handmaidens came, and them she greeted kindly, and braided their
        hair, and breathed on them from her own divine body a wondrous
        perfume. But when the queen beheld the braids of her handmaidens'
        hair and smelt the sweet smell that emanated from them, she sent for
        the stranger woman and took her into her house and made her the nurse
        of her child. But Isis gave the babe her finger instead of her breast
        to suck, and at night she began to burn all that was mortal of him
        away, while she herself in the likeness of a swallow fluttered round
        the pillar that contained her dead brother, twittering mournfully.
        But the queen spied what she was doing and shrieked out when she saw
        her child in flames, and thereby she hindered him from becoming
        immortal. Then the goddess revealed herself and begged for the pillar
        of the roof, and they gave it her, and she cut the coffer out of it,
        and fell upon it and embraced it and lamented so loud that the
        younger of the king's children died of fright on the spot. But the
        trunk of the tree she wrapped in fine linen, and poured ointment on
        it, and gave it to the king and queen, and the wood stands in a
        temple of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg

        Isis and is worshipped by the people of Byblus to this day. And Isis
        put the coffer in a boat and took the eldest of the king's children
        with her and sailed away. As soon as they were alone, she opened the
        chest, and laying her face on the face of her brother she kissed him
        and wept. But the child came behind her softly and saw what she was
        about, and she turned and looked at him in anger, and the child could
        not bear her look and died; but some say that it was not so, but that
        he fell into the sea and was drowned. It is he whom the Egyptians
        sing of at their banquets under the name of Maneros. But Isis put the
        coffer by and went to see her son Horus at the city of Buto, and
        Typhon found the coffer as he was hunting a boar one night by the
        light of a full moon.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=

        knew the body, and rent it into fourteen pieces, and scattered them
        abroad. But Isis sailed up and down the marshes in a shallop made of
        papyrus, looking for the pieces; and that is why when people sail in
        shallops made of papyrus, the crocodiles do not hurt them, for they
        fear or respect the goddess. And that is the reason, too, why there
        are many graves of Osiris in Egypt, for she buried each limb as she
        found it. But others will have it that she buried an image of him in
        every city, pretending it was his body, in order that Osiris might be
        worshipped in many places, and that if Typhon searched for the real
        grave he might not be able to find it.<a id="noteref_12" name=

        body, and reminding them of the benefits they had received she
        exhorted them to bury the body in their own land and to honour Osiris
        as a god. She also besought them to dedicate one of the animals of
        their country, whichever they chose, and to honour it in life as they
        had formerly honoured Osiris, and when it died to grant it obsequies
        like his. And because she would encourage the priests in their own
        interest to bestow the aforesaid honours, she gave them a third part
        of the land to be used by them in the service and worship of the
        gods. Accordingly it is said that the priests, mindful of the
        benefits of Osiris, desirous of gratifying the queen, and moved by
        the prospect of gain, carried out all the injunctions of Isis.
        Wherefore to this day each of the priests imagines that Osiris is
        buried in his country, and they honour the beasts that were
        consecrated in the beginning, and when the animals die the priests
        renew at their burial the mourning for Osiris. But the sacred bulls,
        the one called Apis and the other Mnevis, were dedicated to Osiris,
        and it was ordained that they should be worshipped as gods in common
        by all the Egyptians; since these animals above all others had helped
        the discoverers of corn in sowing the seed and procuring the
        universal benefits of agriculture.”</span><a id="noteref_14" name=

        the god's graves, and other texts mention the parts of his body which
        were treasured as holy relics in each of the sanctuaries. Thus his
        heart was at Athribis, his backbone at Busiris, his neck at
        Letopolis, and his head at Memphis. As often happens in such cases,
        some of his divine limbs were miraculously multiplied. His head, for
        example, was at Abydos as well as at Memphis, and his legs, which
        were remarkably numerous, would have sufficed for several ordinary

        that he had done no murder, neither committed fornication nor borne

        are the epitaphs on Egyptian graves, which reveal, if not the moral
        practice, at least the moral ideals of those who slept beneath them.
        Thus, for example, a man says in his epitaph: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I gave bread to the hungry and clothes to the naked, and
        ferried across in my own boat him who could not pass the water. I was

        wicked after death. In the scenes which represent the Last Judgment
        there is seen crouching beside the scales, in which the heart of the
        dead is being weighed, a monstrous animal known as the <span class=

        crocodile, the trunk of a lion, and the hinder parts of a

        been weighed in the balance and found wanting were delivered over to
        this grim monster to be devoured; but this view appears to be
        conjectural. <span class="tei tei-q">“Generally the animal seems to
        have been placed there simply as guardian of the entrance to the
        Fields of the Blessed, but sometimes it is likened to Set. Elsewhere
        it is said that the judges of the dead slay the wicked and drink
        their blood. In brief, here also we have conflicting statements, and
        can only gather that there seems to have been no general agreement
        among the dwellers in the Valley of the Nile as to the ultimate lot

        man would live eternally in the other world if only his surviving
        friends did for his body what the gods had done for the body of
        Osiris. Hence the ceremonies observed by the Egyptians over the human
        dead were an exact copy of those which Anubis, Horus, and the rest
        had performed over the dead god. <span class="tei tei-q">“At every
        burial there was enacted a representation of the divine mystery which
        had been performed of old over Osiris, when his son, his sisters, his
        friends were gathered round his mangled remains and succeeded by
        their spells and manipulations in converting his broken body into the
        first mummy, which they afterwards reanimated and furnished with the
        means of entering on a new individual life beyond the grave. The
        mummy of the deceased was Osiris; the professional female mourners
        were his two sisters Isis and Nephthys; Anubis, Horus, all the gods
        of the Osirian legend gathered about the corpse.”</span> In this
        solemn drama of death and resurrection the principal part was played
        by the celebrant, who represented Horus the son of the dead and
        resuscitated Osiris.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href=

        opening the mouth of the mummy or of the statue with certain
        instruments specially reserved for the purpose. Geese and gazelles
        were also sacrificed by being decapitated; they were supposed to

        Osiris died and rose again from the dead, so all men hoped to arise
        like him from death to life eternal. In an Egyptian text it is said
        of the departed that <span class="tei tei-q">“as surely as Osiris
        lives, so shall he live also; as surely as Osiris did not die, so
        shall he not die; as surely as Osiris is not annihilated, so shall he

        his poor scattered limbs and mould them with her own hands into a

        head, she brings thee thy bones, she sets thy limbs together and puts
        thy heart in thy body.”</span> Thus the resurrection of the dead was

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we may trust

        cease with the restoration of Osiris <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        presiding deity in the world of the dead. When Horus the younger, the
        son of Osiris and Isis, was grown to man's estate, the ghost of his
        royal and murdered father appeared to him and urged him, like another
        Hamlet, to avenge the foul unnatural murder upon his wicked uncle.
        Thus encouraged, the youth attacked the miscreant. The combat was
        terrific and lasted many days. Horus lost an eye in the conflict and
        Set suffered a still more serious mutilation. At last Thoth parted
        the combatants and healed their wounds; the eye of Horus he restored
        by spitting on it. According to one account the great battle was
        fought on the twenty-sixth day of the month of Thoth. Foiled in open
        war, the artful uncle now took the law of his virtuous nephew. He
        brought a suit of bastardy against Horus, hoping thus to rob him of
        his inheritance and to get possession of it himself; nay, not content
        with having murdered his good brother, the unnatural Set carried his
        rancour even beyond the grave by accusing the dead Osiris of certain
        high crimes and misdemeanours. The case was tried before the supreme
        court of the gods in the great hall at Heliopolis. Thoth, the god of
        wisdom, pleaded the cause of Osiris, and the august judges decided
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“the word of Osiris was true.”</span>
        Moreover, they pronounced Horus to be the true-begotten son of his
        father. So that prince assumed the crown and mounted the throne of
        the lamented Osiris. However, according to another and perhaps later
        version of the story, the victory of Horus over his uncle was by no
        means so decisive, and their struggles ended in a compromise, by
        which Horus reigned over the Delta, while Set became king of the
        upper valley of the Nile from near Memphis to the first cataract. Be
        that as it may, with the accession of Horus began for the Egyptians
        the modern period of the world, for on his throne all the kings of
        Egypt sat as his successors.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31"

        dynastical struggles which attended an attempt to change the right of
        succession from the female to the male line. For under a rule of
        female kinship the heir to the throne is either the late king's
        brother, or the son of the late king's sister, while under a rule of
        male kinship the heir to the throne is the late king's son. In the
        legend of Osiris the rival heirs are Set and Horus, Set being the
        late king's brother, and Horus the late king's son; though Horus
        indeed united both claims to the crown, being the son of the king's
        sister as well as of the king. A similar attempt to shift the line of
        succession seems to have given rise to similar contests at
        Rome.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus according to
        what seems to have been the general native tradition Osiris was a
        good and beloved king of Egypt, who suffered a violent death but rose
        from the dead and was henceforth worshipped as a deity. In harmony
        with this tradition he was regularly represented by sculptors and
        painters in human and regal form as a dead king, swathed in the
        wrappings of a mummy, but wearing on his head a kingly crown and
        grasping in one of his hands, which were left free from the bandages,
        a kingly sceptre.<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=

        cities above all others were associated with his myth or memory. One
        of them was Busiris in Lower Egypt, which claimed to possess his
        backbone; the other was Abydos in Upper Egypt, which gloried in the
        possession of his head.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href=

        Encircled by the nimbus of the dead yet living god, Abydos,
        originally an obscure place, became from the end of the Old Kingdom
        the holiest spot in Egypt; his tomb there would seem to have been to
        the Egyptians what the Church of the Holy <span class="tei tei-pb"

        the wish of every pious man that his dead body should rest in
        hallowed earth near the grave of the glorified Osiris. Few indeed
        were rich enough to enjoy this inestimable privilege; for, apart from
        the cost of a tomb in the sacred city, the mere transport of mummies
        from great distances was both difficult and expensive. Yet so eager
        were many to absorb in death the blessed influence which radiated
        from the holy sepulchre that they caused their surviving friends to
        convey their mortal remains to Abydos, there to tarry for a short
        time, and then to be brought back by river and interred in the tombs
        which had been made ready for them in their native land. Others had
        cenotaphs built or memorial tablets erected for themselves near the
        tomb of their dead and risen Lord, that they might share with him the
        bliss of a joyful resurrection.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35"

        three thousand two hundred years before our era, seems to have marked
        an epoch in the history of Egypt, for under him the costume, the
        figure drawing, and the hieroglyphics all assumed the character which
        they thenceforth preserved to the very end of Egyptian
        nationality.<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=
        "#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> Later
        ages identified him with Osiris in a more intimate sense than that in
        which the divine title was lavished on every dead king and indeed on
        every dead man; for his tomb was actually converted into the tomb of
        Osiris and as such received in great profusion the offerings of the
        faithful. Somewhere between the twenty-second and the twenty-sixth
        dynasty a massive bier of grey granite was placed in the sepulchral
        chamber. On it, cut in high relief, reposes a shrouded figure of the
        dead Osiris. He lies at full length, with bare and upturned face. On
        his head is the White Crown of Upper Egypt; in his hands, which issue
        from the shroud, he holds the characteristic emblems of the god, the
        sceptre and the scourge. At the four corners of the bier are perched
        four hawks, representing the four children of Horus, each with their
        father's banner, keeping watch over the dead god, as they kept watch
        over the four quarters of the world. A fifth hawk seems to have been
        perched on the middle of the body of Osiris, but it had been broken
        off before the tomb was discovered in recent years, for only the
        bird's claws remain in position. Finely carved heads of lions, one at
        each corner of the bier, with the claws to match below, complete the
        impressive monument. The scene represented is unquestionably the
        impregnation of Isis in the form of a hawk by the dead Osiris; the
        Copts who dismantled the shrine appear to have vented their pious
        rage on the figure of the hawk Isis by carrying it off or smashing
        it. If any doubt could exist as to the meaning of these sculptured
        figures, it would be set at rest by the ancient inscriptions attached
        to them. Over against the right shoulder of the shrouded figure, who
        lies stretched on the bier, are carved in hieroglyphics the words,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Osiris, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class=

        against the place where the missing hawk perched on the body of the
        dead god is carved the symbol of Isis. Two relics of the ancient
        human occupants of the tomb escaped alike the fury of the fanatics
        and the avarice of the plunderers who pillaged and destroyed it. One
        of the relics is a human skull, from which the lower jawbone is
        missing; the other is an arm encircled by gorgeous jewelled bracelets
        of gold, turquoises, amethysts, and dark purple lapis lazuli. The
        former may be the head of King Khent himself; the latter is almost
        certainly the arm of his queen. One of the bracelets is composed of
        alternate plaques of gold and turquoise, each ornamented with the
        figure of a hawk perched on the top of it.<a id="noteref_40" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a> The hawk
        was the sacred bird or crest of the earliest dynasties of Egyptian
        kings. The figure of a hawk was borne before the king as a standard
        on solemn occasions: the oldest capital of the country known to us
        was called Hawk-town: there the kings of the first dynasty built a
        temple to the hawk: there in modern times has been found a splendid
        golden head of a hawk dating from the Ancient Empire; and on the
        life-like statue of King Chephren of the third dynasty we see a hawk
        with out-spread wings protecting the back of the monarch's head.

        of a hawk in order to mate with her dead husband; why the queen of
        Egypt wore on her arm a bracelet adorned with golden hawks; and why
        in the holy sepulchre the four sons of Horus were represented in the

        doubtless late and probably untrustworthy. It may have been suggested

        the worship of the Phoenician Adonis in that city. But it is possible
        that the story has no deeper foundation than a verbal

        the Greek word for papyrus; and as Isis is said after the death of
        Osiris to have taken refuge in the papyrus swamps of the Delta, where
        she gave birth to and reared her son Horus, a Greek writer may
        perhaps have confused the plant with the city of the same name.<a id=

        association of Osiris with Adonis at Byblus gave rise to a curious
        tale. It is said that every year the people beyond the rivers of
        Ethiopia used to write a letter to the women of Byblus informing them
        that the lost and lamented Adonis was found. This letter they
        enclosed in an earthen pot, which they sealed and sent floating down
        the river to the sea. The waves carried the pot to Byblus, where
        every year it arrived at the time when the Syrian women were weeping
        for their dead Lord. The pot was taken up from the water and opened:
        the letter was read; and the weeping women dried their tears, because

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A useful clue to
        the original nature of a god or goddess is often furnished by the
        season at which his or her festival is celebrated. Thus, if the
        festival falls at the new or the full moon, there is a certain
        presumption that the deity thus honoured either is the moon or at
        least has lunar affinities. If the festival is held at the winter or
        summer solstice, we naturally surmise that the god is the sun, or at
        all events that he stands in some close relation to that luminary.
        Again, if the festival coincides with the time of sowing or harvest,
        we are inclined to infer that the divinity is an embodiment of the
        earth or of the corn. These presumptions or inferences, taken by
        themselves, are by no means conclusive; but if they happen to be
        confirmed by other indications, the evidence may be regarded as
        fairly strong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately, in
        dealing with the Egyptian gods we are in a great measure precluded
        from making use of this clue. The reason is not that the dates of the
        festivals are always unknown, but that they shifted from year to
        year, until after a long interval they had revolved through the whole
        course of the seasons. This gradual revolution of the festal Egyptian
        cycle resulted from the employment of a calendar year which neither
        corresponded exactly to the solar year nor was periodically corrected
        by intercalation.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href=

        id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The solar year is equivalent
        to about three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days; but the
        ancient Egyptians, ignoring the quarter of a day, reckoned the year
        at three hundred and sixty-five days only.<a id="noteref_47" name=
        "noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> Thus
        each of their calendar years was shorter than the true solar year by
        about a quarter of a day. In four years the deficiency amounted to
        one whole day; in forty years it amounted to ten days; in four
        hundred years it amounted to a hundred days; and so it went on
        increasing until after a lapse of four times three hundred and
        sixty-five, or one thousand four hundred and sixty solar years, the
        deficiency amounted to three hundred and sixty-five days, or a whole
        Egyptian year. Hence one thousand four hundred and sixty solar years,
        or their equivalent, one thousand four hundred and sixty-one Egyptian
        years, formed a period or cycle at the end of which the Egyptian
        festivals returned to those points of the solar year at which they
        had been celebrated in the beginning.<a id="noteref_48" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the official
        calendar was completely divorced, except at rare and long intervals,
        from what may be called the natural calendar of the shepherd, the
        husbandman, and the sailor—that is, from the course of the seasons in
        which the times for the various labours of cattle-breeding, tillage,
        and navigation are marked by the position of the sun in the sky, the
        rising or setting of the stars, the fall of rain, the growth of
        pasture, the ripening of the corn, the blowing of certain winds, and
        so forth. Nowhere, perhaps, are the events of this natural calendar
        better marked or more regular in their recurrence than in Egypt;
        nowhere accordingly could their divergence from the corresponding
        dates of the official calendar be more readily observed. The

        id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> divergence certainly did not
        escape the notice of the Egyptians themselves, and some of them
        apparently attempted successfully to correct it. Thus we are told
        that the Theban priests, who particularly excelled in astronomy, were
        acquainted with the true length of the solar year, and harmonized the
        calendar with it by intercalating a day every few, probably every
        four, years.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href=

        For they neither reckon the years by the sun nor the months and days
        by the moon, but they observe a peculiar system of their own. They
        wish, in fact, that the sacrifices should not always be offered to
        the gods at the same time of the year, but that they should pass
        through all the seasons of the year, so that the summer festival
        should in time be celebrated in winter, in autumn, and in spring. For
        that purpose they employ a year of three hundred and sixty-five days,
        composed of twelve months of thirty days each, with five

        the ancient Egyptians, but it naturally proved a stumbling-block to
        the less patient temperament of their European conquerors.
        Accordingly in the reign of King Ptolemy III. Euergetes a decree was
        passed that henceforth the movable Egyptian year should be converted
        into a fixed solar year by the intercalation of one day at the end of
        every four years, <span class="tei tei-q">“in order that the seasons
        may do their duty perpetually according to the present constitution
        of the world, and that it may not happen, through the shifting of the
        star by one day in four years, that some of the public festivals
        which are now held in the winter should ever be celebrated in the
        summer, and that other festivals now held in the summer should
        hereafter be celebrated in the winter, as has happened before, and
        must happen again if the year of three hundred and sixty-five days be

        the country. The expedient by which they effected the change was a
        simple one; indeed it was no other than that to which Ptolemy
        Euergetes had resorted for the same purpose. They merely intercalated
        one day at the end of every four years, thus equalizing within a
        small fraction four calendar years to four solar years. Henceforth
        the official and the natural calendars were in practical agreement.
        The movable Egyptian year had been converted into the fixed
        Alexandrian year, as it was called, which agreed with the Julian year
        in length and in its system of intercalation, though it differed from
        that year in retaining the twelve equal Egyptian months and five
        supplementary days.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=

        while the new calendar received the sanction of law and regulated the

          have been compelled to observe for himself those natural signals
          which marked the times for the various operations of husbandry. In
          all ages of which we possess any records the Egyptians have been an
          agricultural people, dependent for their subsistence on the growth
          of the corn. The cereals which they cultivated were wheat, barley,
          and apparently sorghum (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"

          as now the whole country, with the exception of a fringe on the
          coast of the Mediterranean, was almost rainless, and owed its
          immense fertility entirely to the annual inundation of the Nile,
          which, regulated by an elaborate system of dams and canals, was
          distributed over the fields, renewing the soil year by year with a
          fresh deposit of mud washed down from the great equatorial lakes
          and the mountains of Abyssinia. Hence the rise of the river has
          always been watched by the inhabitants with the utmost anxiety; for
          if it either falls short of or exceeds a certain height, dearth and
          famine are the inevitable consequences.<a id="noteref_58" name=

          July that it swells to a mighty tide. By the end of September the
          inundation is at its greatest height. The country is now submerged,
          and presents the appearance of a sea of turbid water, from which
          the towns and villages, built on higher ground, rise like islands.
          For about a month the flood remains nearly stationary, then sinks
          more and more rapidly, till by December or January the river has
          returned to its ordinary bed. With the approach of summer the level
          of the water continues to fall. In the early days of June the Nile
          is reduced to half its ordinary breadth; and Egypt, scorched by the
          sun, blasted by the wind that has blown from the Sahara for many
          days, seems a mere continuation of the desert. The trees are choked
          with a thick layer of grey dust. A few meagre patches of
          vegetables, watered with difficulty, struggle painfully for
          existence in the immediate neighbourhood of the villages. Some
          appearance of verdure lingers beside the canals and in the hollows
          from which the moisture has not wholly evaporated. The plain
          appears to pant in the pitiless sunshine, bare, dusty,
          ash-coloured, cracked and seamed as far as the eye can see with a
          network of fissures. From the middle of April till the middle of

          suppose that these various events of the agricultural year were
          celebrated by the Egyptian farmer with some simple religious rites
          designed to secure the blessing of the gods upon his labours. These
          rustic ceremonies he would continue to perform year after year at
          the same season, while the solemn festivals of the priests
          continued to shift, with the shifting calendar, from summer through
          spring to winter, and so backward through autumn to summer. The
          rites of the husbandman were stable because they rested on direct
          observation of nature: the rites of the priest were unstable
          because they were based on a false calculation. Yet many of the
          priestly festivals may have been nothing but the old rural
          festivals disguised in the course of ages by the pomp of
          sacerdotalism and severed, by the error of the calendar, from their

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
          conjectures are confirmed by the little we know both of the popular
          and of the official Egyptian religion. Thus we are told that the
          Egyptians held a festival of Isis at the time when the Nile began
          to rise. They believed that the goddess was then mourning for the
          lost Osiris, and that the tears which dropped from her eyes swelled
          the impetuous tide of the river.<a id="noteref_62" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> Hence
          in Egyptian inscriptions Isis is spoken of as she <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“who maketh the Nile to swell and overflow, who maketh
          the Nile to swell in his season.”</span><a id="noteref_63" name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>
          Similarly the Toradjas of Central Celebes imagine that showers of
          rain are the tears shed by the compassionate gods in weeping for
          somebody who is about to die; a shower in the morning is to them an
          infallible omen of death.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href=

          However, an uneasy suspicion would seem to have occurred to the
          Egyptians that perhaps after all the tears of the goddess might not
          suffice of themselves to raise the water to the proper level; so in
          the time of Rameses II. the king used on the first day of the flood
          to throw into the Nile a written order commanding the river to do
          its duty, and the submissive stream never failed to obey the royal
          mandate.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href=
          "#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> Yet
          the ancient belief survives in a modified form to this day. For the
          Nile, as we saw, begins to rise in June about the time of the
          summer solstice, and the people still attribute its increased
          volume to a miraculous drop which falls into the river on the night
          of the seventeenth of the month. The charms and divinations which
          they practise on that mystic night in order to ascertain the length
          of their own life and to rid the houses of bugs may well date from
          a remote antiquity.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href=

          natural than that he should be mourned at midsummer. For by that
          time the harvest was past, the fields were bare, the river ran low,
          life seemed to be suspended, the corn-god was dead. At such a

          the effect of making the star to shift its place in the calendar by
          one day in four years. Thus if Sirius rose on the first of Thoth in
          one year, it would rise on the second of Thoth four years
          afterwards, on the third of Thoth eight years afterwards, and so on
          until after the lapse of a Siriac or Sothic period of fourteen
          hundred and sixty solar years the first of Thoth again coincided
          with the heliacal rising of Sirius.<a id="noteref_72" name=

          utmost importance for the progress of astronomy, since it led the
          Egyptians directly to the determination of the approximately true
          length of the solar year and thus laid the basis of our modern

          induced his countrymen to regard the heavenly body with an

          in the Egyptian year. At Cairo the operation generally takes place
          between the sixth and the sixteenth of August, and till lately was
          attended by ceremonies which deserve to be noticed, because they
          were probably handed down from antiquity. An ancient canal, known
          by the name of the Khalíj, formerly passed through the native town
          of Cairo. Near its entrance the canal was crossed by a dam of
          earth, very broad at the bottom and diminishing in breadth upwards,
          which used to be constructed before or soon after the Nile began to
          rise. In front of the dam, on the side of the river, was reared a
          truncated cone of earth called the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">'arooseh</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“bride,”</span> on the top of which a little maize or
          millet was generally sown. This <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“bride”</span> was commonly washed down by the rising
          tide a week or a fortnight before the cutting of the dam. Tradition
          runs that the old custom was to deck a young virgin in gay apparel
          and throw her into the river as a sacrifice to obtain a plentiful
          inundation.<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href=
          "#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Certainly human sacrifices were offered for a similar purpose by
          the Wajagga of German East Africa down to recent years. These
          people irrigate their fields by means of skilfully constructed
          channels, through which they conduct the water of the mountain
          brooks and rivers to the thirsty land. They imagine that the
          spirits of their forefathers dwell in the rocky basins of these
          rushing streams, and that they would resent the withdrawal of the
          water to irrigate the fields if compensation were not offered to
          them. The water-rate paid to them consisted of a child,
          uncircumcised and of unblemished body, who was decked with
          ornaments and bells and thrown into the river to drown, before they
          ventured to draw off the water into the irrigation channel. Having
          thrown him in, his executioners shewed a clean pair of heels,
          because they expected the river to rise in flood at once on receipt
          of the water-rate.<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href=
          "#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> In
          similar circumstances the Njamus of British East Africa sacrifice a
          sheep before they let the water of the stream flow into the ditch
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name=
          "Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or artificial
          channel. The fat, dung, and blood of the animal are sprinkled at
          the mouth of the ditch and in the water; thereupon the dam is
          broken down and the stream pours into the ditch. The sacrifice may
          only be offered by a man of the Il Mayek clan, and for two days
          afterwards he wears the skin of the beast tied round his head. No
          one may quarrel with this man while the water is irrigating the
          crops, else the people believe that the water would cease to flow
          in the ditch; more than that, if the men of the Il Mayek clan were
          angry and sulked for ten days, the water would dry up permanently
          for that season. Hence the Il Mayek clan enjoys great consideration
          in the tribe, since the crops are thought to depend on their good
          will and good offices. Ten elders assist at the sacrifice of the
          sheep, though they may take no part in it. They must all be of a
          particular age; and after the ceremony they may not cohabit with
          their wives until harvest, and they are obliged to sleep at night
          in their granaries. Curiously enough, too, while the water is
          irrigating the fields, nobody may kill waterbuck, eland, oryx,
          zebra, rhinoceros, or hippopotamus. Anybody caught red-handed in
          the act of breaking this game-law would at once be cast out of the
          village.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href=

          river, conceived as a male power, to his bride the corn-land, which
          was soon to be fertilized by his water. The ceremony was therefore
          a charm to ensure the growth of the crops. As such it probably
          dated, in one form or another, from ancient times. Dense crowds
          assembled to witness the cutting of the dam. The operation was
          performed before sunrise, and many people spent the preceding night
          on the banks of the canal or in boats lit with lamps on the river,
          while fireworks were displayed and guns discharged at frequent
          intervals. Before sunrise a great number of workmen began to cut
          the dam, and the task was accomplished about an hour before the sun
          appeared on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg
          040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          horizon. When only a thin ridge of earth remained, a boat with an
          officer on board was propelled against it, and breaking through the
          slight barrier descended with the rush of water into the canal. The
          Governor of Cairo flung a purse of gold into the boat as it passed.
          Formerly the custom was to throw money into the canal. The populace
          used to dive after it, and several lives were generally lost in the
          scramble.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href=

          practice also would seem to have been ancient, for Seneca tells us
          that at a place called the Veins of the Nile, not far from Philae,
          the priests used to cast money and offerings of gold into the river

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next great
          operation of the agricultural year in Egypt is the sowing of the
          seed in November, when the water of the inundation has retreated
          from the fields. With the Egyptians, as with many peoples of
          antiquity, the committing of the seed to the earth assumed the
          character of a solemn and mournful rite. On this subject I will let
          Plutarch speak for himself. <span class="tei tei-q">“What,”</span>
          he asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“are we to make of the gloomy,
          joyless, and mournful sacrifices, if it is wrong either to omit the
          established rites or to confuse and disturb our conceptions of the
          gods by absurd suspicions? For the Greeks also perform many rites
          which resemble those of the Egyptians and are observed about the
          same time. Thus at the festival of the Thesmophoria in Athens
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name=
          "Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> women sit on the

          One,<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href=
          "#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> naming
          that festival sorrowful because Demeter is sorrowing for the
          descent of the Maiden. The month is the month of sowing about the
          setting of the Pleiades.<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
          "#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> The
          Egyptians call it Athyr, the Athenians Pyanepsion, the Boeotians
          the month of Demeter. Theopompus informs us that the western
          peoples consider and call the winter Cronus, the summer Aphrodite,
          and the spring Persephone, and they believe that all things are
          brought into being by Cronus and Aphrodite. The Phrygians imagine
          that the god sleeps in winter and wakes in summer, and accordingly
          they celebrate with Bacchic rites the putting him to bed in winter
          and his awakening in summer. The Paphlagonians allege that he is
          bound fast and shut up in winter, but that he stirs and is set free
          in spring. And the season furnishes a hint that the sadness is for
          the hiding of those fruits of the earth which the ancients
          esteemed, not indeed gods, but great and necessary gifts bestowed
          by the gods in order that men might not lead the life of savages
          and of wild beasts. For it was that time of year when they saw some
          of the fruits vanishing and falling from the trees, while they
          sowed others grudgingly and with difficulty, scraping the earth
          with their hands and huddling it up again, on the uncertain chance
          that what they deposited in the ground would ever ripen and come to
          maturity. Thus they did in many respects like those who bury and
          mourn their dead. And just as we say that a purchaser of Plato's
          books purchases Plato, or that an actor who plays the comedies of
          Menander plays Menander, so the men of old did not hesitate to call
          the gifts and products of the gods by the names of the gods
          themselves, thereby honouring and glorifying the things on account
          of their utility. But in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg
          042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          after ages simple folk in their ignorance applied to the gods
          statements which only held true of the fruits of the earth, and so
          they came not merely to say but actually to believe that the growth
          and decay of plants, on which they subsisted,<a id="noteref_82"
          name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> were
          the birth and the death of gods. Thus they fell into absurd,
          immoral, and confused ways of thinking, though all the while the
          absurdity of the fallacy was manifest. Hence Xenophanes of Colophon
          declared that if the Egyptians deemed their gods divine they should
          not weep for them, and that if they wept for them they should not
          deem them divine. <span class="tei tei-q">‘For it is
          ridiculous,’</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘to lament and
          pray that the fruits would be good enough to grow and ripen again
          in order that they may again be eaten and lamented.’</span> But he
          was wrong, for though the lamentations are for the fruits, the
          prayers are addressed to the gods, as the causes and givers of
          them, that they would be pleased to make fresh fruits to spring up
          instead of those that perish.”</span><a id="noteref_83" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
          interesting passage Plutarch expresses his belief that the worship
          of the fruits of the earth was the result of a verbal
          misapprehension or disease of language, as it has been called by a
          modern school of mythologists, who explain the origin of myths in
          general on the same easy principle of metaphors misunderstood.
          Primitive man, on Plutarch's theory, firmly believed that the
          fruits of the earth on which he subsisted were not themselves gods
          but merely the gifts of the gods, who were the real givers of all
          good things. Yet at the same time men were in the habit of
          bestowing on these divine products the names of their divine
          creators, either out of gratitude or merely for the sake of
          brevity, as when we say that a man has bought a Shakespeare or
          acted Molière, when we mean that he has bought the works of
          Shakespeare or acted the plays of Molière. This abbreviated mode of
          expression was misunderstood in later times, and so <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> people came to look upon the fruits of
          the earth as themselves divine instead of as being the work of
          divinities: in short, they mistook the creature for the creator. In
          like manner Plutarch would explain the Egyptian worship of animals
          as reverence done not so much to the beasts themselves as to the
          great god who displays the divine handiwork in sentient organisms

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The comparative
          study of religion has proved that these theories of Plutarch are an
          inversion of the truth. Fetishism, or the view that the fruits of
          the earth and things in general are divine or animated by powerful
          spirits, is not, as Plutarch imagined, a late corruption of a pure
          and primitive theism, which regarded the gods as the creators and
          givers of all good things. On the contrary, fetishism is early and
          theism is late in the history of mankind. In this respect
          Xenophanes, whom Plutarch attempts to correct, displayed a much
          truer insight into the mind of the savage. To weep crocodile tears
          over the animals and plants which he kills and eats, and to pray
          them to come again in order that they may be again eaten and again
          lamented—this may seem absurd to us, but it is precisely what the
          savage does. And from his point of view the proceeding is not at
          all absurd but perfectly rational and well calculated to answer his
          ends. For he sincerely believes that animals and fruits are
          tenanted by spirits who can harm him if they please, and who cannot
          but be put to considerable inconvenience by that destruction of
          their bodies which is unfortunately inseparable from the processes
          of mastication and digestion. What more natural, therefore, than
          that the savage should offer excuses to the beasts and the fruits
          for the painful necessity he is under of consuming them, and that
          he should endeavour to alleviate their pangs by soft words and an
          air of respectful sympathy, in order that they may bear him no
          grudge, and may in due time come again to be again eaten and again
          lamented? Judged by the standard of primitive manners the attitude
          of the walrus to the oysters was strictly correct:—</p><span class=

          shall quote the general statement of a writer on the Indians of
          British Columbia, because it covers the case of vegetable as well
          as of animal food. After describing the respectful welcome accorded
          by the Stlatlum Indians to the first <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“sock-eye”</span> salmon which they have caught in the
          season, he goes on: <span class="tei tei-q">“The significance of
          these ceremonies is easy to perceive when we remember the attitude
          of the Indians towards nature generally, and recall their myths
          relating to the salmon, and their coming to their rivers and
          streams. Nothing that the Indian of this region eats is regarded by
          him as mere food and nothing more. Not a single plant, animal, or
          fish, or other object upon which he feeds, is looked upon in this
          light, or as something he has secured for himself by his own wit
          and skill. He regards it rather as something which has been
          voluntarily and compassionately placed in his hands by the goodwill
          and consent of the 'spirit' of the object itself, or by the
          intercession and magic of his culture-heroes; to be retained and
          used by him only upon the fulfilment of certain conditions. These
          conditions include respect and reverent care in the killing or
          plucking of the animal or plant and proper treatment of the parts
          he has no use for, such as the bones, blood, and offal; and the
          depositing of the same in some stream or lake, so that the object
          may by that means renew its life and physical form. The practices
          in connection with the killing of animals and the gathering of
          plants and fruits all make this quite clear, and it is only when we
          bear this attitude of the savage towards nature in mind that we can
          hope to rightly understand the motives and purposes of many of his
          strange customs and beliefs.”</span><a id="noteref_86" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can now
          understand why among many peoples of antiquity, as Plutarch tells
          us, the time of sowing was a time of sorrow. The laying of the seed
          in the earth was a burial of the divine element, and it was fitting
          that like a human burial it should be performed with gravity and
          the semblance, if not the reality, of sorrow. Yet they sorrowed not
          without hope, perhaps a sure and certain hope, that the seed which
          they thus committed with sighs and tears to the ground would yet
          rise from the dust and yield fruit a hundredfold to the reaper.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Egyptian
          harvest, as we have seen, falls not in autumn but in spring, in the
          months of March, April, and May. To the husbandman the time of
          harvest, at least in a good year, must necessarily be a season of
          joy: in bringing home his sheaves he is requited for his long and
          anxious labours. Yet if the old Egyptian farmer felt a secret joy
          at reaping and garnering the grain, it was essential that he should
          conceal the natural emotion under an air of profound dejection. For
          was he not severing the body of the corn-god with his sickle and
          trampling it to pieces under the hoofs of his cattle on the
          threshing-floor?<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>
          Accordingly we are told that it was an ancient custom of the
          Egyptian corn-reapers to beat their breasts and lament over the
          first sheaf cut, while at the same time they called upon
          Isis.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=
          "#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> The
          invocation seems to have taken the form of a melancholy chant, to
          which the Greeks gave the name of Maneros. Similar plaintive
          strains were chanted by corn-reapers in <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class=

          Probably all these doleful ditties were lamentations for the
          corn-god killed by the sickles of the reapers. In Egypt the slain
          deity was Osiris, and the name <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Maneros</span></span>
          applied to the dirge appears to be derived from certain words
          meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“Come to thy house,”</span> which
          often occur in the lamentations for the dead god.<a id="noteref_91"

          meant maize, holds the first place in the household economy and the
          ceremonial observance of the Cherokee Indians, who invoke it under
          the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Old Woman”</span> in
          allusion to a myth that it sprang from the blood of an old woman
          killed by her disobedient sons. <span class="tei tei-q">“Much
          ceremony accompanied the planting and tending of the crop. Seven
          grains, the sacred number, were put into each hill, and these were
          not afterwards thinned out. After the last working of the crop, the
          priest and an assistant—generally the owner of the field—went into
          the field and built a small enclosure in the centre. Then entering
          it, they seated themselves upon the ground, with heads bent down,
          and while the assistant kept perfect silence the priest, with
          rattle in hand, sang songs of invocation to the spirit of the corn.
          Soon, according to the orthodox belief, a loud rustling would be
          heard outside, which they would know was caused by the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Old Woman’</span> bringing the corn into the field,
          but neither must look up until the song was finished. This ceremony
          was repeated on four successive nights, after which no one entered
          the field for seven other nights, when the priest himself went in,
          and, if all the sacred regulations had been properly observed, was
          rewarded by finding young ears upon the stalks. The corn ceremonies
          could be performed by the owner of the field himself, provided he
          was willing to pay a sufficient fee to the priest in order to learn
          the songs and ritual. Care was always taken to keep a <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> clean trail from the field to the
          house, so that the corn might be encouraged to stay at home and not
          go wandering elsewhere. Most of these customs have now fallen into
          disuse excepting among the old people, by many of whom they are
          still religiously observed. Another curious ceremony, of which even
          the memory is now almost forgotten, was enacted after the first
          working of the corn, when the owner or priest stood in succession
          at each of the four corners of the field and wept and wailed
          loudly. Even the priests are now unable to give a reason for this
          performance, which may have been a lament for the bloody death of
          Selu,”</span> the Old Woman of the Corn.<a id="noteref_92" name=

          these Cherokee practices the lamentations and the invocations of
          the Old Woman of the Corn resemble the ancient Egyptian customs of
          lamenting over the first corn cut and calling upon Isis, herself
          probably in one of her aspects an Old Woman of the Corn. Further,
          the Cherokee precaution of leaving a clear path from the field to
          the house resembles the Egyptian invitation to Osiris, <span class=

          and breast. <span class="tei tei-q">“No joy is shown by the

          assembly-room. The wood must be cut from a tree on the top of the
          highest hill. In lopping off the boughs the Indian weeps and sobs
          piteously, shedding real tears, and at the top of the tree he
          leaves two branches and a top-knot, resembling a man's head and
          outstretched arms. Having descended from the tree, he binds the
          wood in a faggot and carries it back to the assembly-room,
          blubbering all the way. If he is asked why he thus weeps at cutting

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such, then, were
          the principal events of the farmer's calendar in ancient Egypt, and
          such the simple religious rites by which he celebrated them. But we
          have still to consider the Osirian festivals of the official
          calendar, so far as these are described by Greek writers or
          recorded on the monuments. In examining them it is necessary to
          bear in mind that on account of the movable year of the old
          Egyptian calendar the true or astronomical dates of the official
          festivals must have varied from year to year, at least until the
          adoption of the fixed Alexandrian year in 30 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> From that time
          onward, apparently, the dates of the festivals were determined by
          the new calendar, and so ceased to rotate throughout the length of
          the solar year. At all events Plutarch, writing about the end of
          the first century, implies that they were then fixed, not movable;
          for though he does not mention the Alexandrian calendar, he clearly
          dates the festivals by it.<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97"
          href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Moreover, the long festal calendar of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Esne, an important document of the Imperial
          age, is obviously based on the fixed Alexandrian year; for it
          assigns the mark for New Year's Day to the day which corresponds to
          the twenty-ninth of August, which was the first day of the
          Alexandrian year, and its references to the rising of the Nile, the
          position of the sun, and the operations of agriculture are all in
          harmony with this supposition.<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98"

          we may take it as fairly certain that from 30 <span class=

          commemoration of the divine passion was held once a year: the
          people mourned and beat their breasts at it to testify their sorrow
          for the death of the god; and an image of a cow, made of gilt wood
          with a golden sun between its horns, was carried out of the chamber
          in which it stood the rest of the year.<a id="noteref_100" name=

          probable that the carrying out of her cow-shaped image symbolized
          the goddess searching for the dead body of Osiris; for this was the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This universal

          St. Michael and the lower Yukon River in Alaska hold a festival of
          the dead every year at the end of November or the beginning of
          December, as well as a greater festival at intervals of several
          years. At these seasons, food, drink, and clothes are provided for
          the returning ghosts in the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kashim</span></span> or clubhouse of the
          village, which is illuminated with oil lamps. Every man or woman
          who wishes to honour a dead friend sets up a lamp on a stand in
          front of the place which the deceased used to occupy in the
          clubhouse. These lamps, filled with seal oil, are kept burning day
          and night till the festival is over. They are believed to light the
          shades on their return to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg
          052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          their old home and back again to the land of the dead. If any one
          fails to put up a lamp in the clubhouse and to keep it burning, the
          shade whom he or she desires to honour could not find its way to
          the place and so would miss the feast. On the eve of the festival
          the nearest male relation goes to the grave and summons the ghost
          by planting there a small model of a seal spear or of a wooden
          dish, according as the deceased was a man or a woman. The badges of
          the dead are marked on these implements. When all is ready, the
          ghosts gather in the fire-pit under the clubhouse, and ascending
          through the floor at the proper moment take possession of the
          bodies of their namesakes, to whom the offerings of food, drink,
          and clothing are made for the benefit of the dead. Thus each shade
          obtains the supplies he needs in the other world. The dead who have
          none to make offerings to them are believed to suffer great
          destitution. Hence the Esquimaux fear to die without leaving behind
          them some one who will sacrifice to their spirits, and childless
          people generally adopt children lest their shades should be
          forgotten at the festivals. When a person has been much disliked,
          his ghost is sometimes purposely ignored, and that is deemed the
          severest punishment that could be inflicted upon him. After the
          songs of invitation to the dead have been sung, the givers of the
          feast take a small portion of food from every dish and cast it down
          as an offering to the shades; then each pours a little water on the
          floor so that it runs through the cracks. In this way they believe
          that the spiritual essence of all the food and water is conveyed to
          the souls. The remainder of the food is afterwards distributed
          among the people present, who eat of it heartily. Then with songs
          and dances the feast comes to an end, and the ghosts are dismissed
          to their own place. Dances form a conspicuous feature of the great
          festival of the dead, which is held every few years. The dancers
          dance not only in the clubhouse but also at the graves and on the
          ice, if the deceased met their death by drowning.<a id=

          of the ghosts by fasting for several days, especially by abstaining
          from flesh. Disguised with paint and soot, adorned with feathers
          and grasses, they danced and sang in the village or rushed about in
          the forest by night with burning torches in their hands. After a
          time they presented themselves to the relations of the deceased,
          who looked upon these maskers as in very truth their departed
          friends and received them accordingly with an outburst of
          lamentation, the old women scratching their own faces and smiting

          whatever else the spirits are supposed to need in the other world.
          These they hang on a semicircle of boughs or small trees, cut and
          set in the ground leafless. In the centre burns a great fire, and
          hard by are the graves. The ceremony begins at evening and lasts
          till daybreak. As darkness falls, men and women sit on the graves
          and wail for the dead of the year. Then they dance round the fire
          with frenzied yells and whoops, casting from time to time the

          this nether world. They have been encouraged in this belief by the
          priests, who were in the habit of sending out and appropriating to
          themselves all these things, and then making the poor simple

          month of every year, which corresponded to our November. On this
          day of All Souls the houses were decked out to welcome the spirits.
          Jars of food and drink were set on a table in the principal room,
          and the family went forth with torches to meet the ghosts and
          invite them to enter. Then returning themselves to the house they
          knelt around the table, and with eyes bent on the ground prayed the
          souls to accept of the offerings and to procure the blessings of
          the gods upon the family. Thus they remained on bended knees and
          with downcast eyes till the morning, not daring to look at the
          table lest they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg

          should offend the spirits by spying on them at their meal. With the
          first beams of the sun they rose, glad at heart. The jars of food
          which had been presented to the dead were given to the poor or
          deposited in a secret place.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
          natives of Sumba, an East Indian island, celebrate a New Year's
          festival, which is at the same time a festival of the dead. The
          graves are in the middle of the village, and at a given moment all
          the people repair to them and raise a loud weeping and wailing.
          Then after indulging for a short time in the national pastimes they
          disperse to their houses, and every family calls upon its dead to
          come back. The ghosts are believed to hear and accept the
          invitation. Accordingly betel and areca nuts are set out for them.
          Victims, too, are sacrificed in front of every house, and their
          hearts and livers are offered with rice to the dead. After a decent
          interval these portions are distributed amongst the living, who
          consume them and banquet gaily on flesh and rice, a rare event in
          their frugal lives. Then they play, dance, and sing to their
          heart's content, and the festival which began so lugubriously ends
          by being the merriest of the year. A little before daybreak the
          invisible guests take their departure. All the people turn out of
          their houses to escort them a little way. Holding in one hand the
          half of a coco-nut, which contains a small packet of provisions for
          the dead, and in the other hand a piece of smouldering wood, they
          march in procession, singing a drawling song to the accompaniment
          of a gong and waving the lighted brands in time to the music. So
          they move through the darkness till with the last words of the song

          Sea Dyaks of Borneo celebrate a great festival in honour of the
          dead at irregular intervals, it may be one or more years after the
          death of a particular person. All who have died since the last
          feast was held, and have not yet been honoured by such a
          celebration, are remembered at this time; hence the number of
          persons commemorated may be great, especially if many years have
          elapsed since the last commemoration service. The preparations last
          many weeks: food and drink and all other necessaries are stored in
          plenty, and the whole neighbourhood for miles round is invited to
          attend. On the eve of the feast the women take bamboo splints and
          fashion out of them little models of various useful articles, and
          these models are hung over the graves for the use of the dead in
          the other world. If the feast is held in honour of a man, the
          things manufactured in his behoof will take the form of a bamboo
          gun, a shield, a war-cap, and so on; if it is a woman who is
          commemorated, little models of a loom, a fish-basket, a
          winnowing-fan and such like things will be provided for her spirit;
          and if it is a child for whom the rite is performed, toys of
          various kinds will be made ready for the childish ghost. Finally,
          to stay the appetite of ghosts who may be too sharp-set to wait for
          the formal banquet in the house, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> a supply of victuals is very considerately
          placed outside the house on which the hungry spirits may fall to
          without delay. The dead arrive in a boat from the other world; for
          living Dyaks generally travel by river, from which it necessarily
          follows that Dyak ghosts do so likewise. The ship in which the
          ghostly visitors voyage to the land of the living is not much to
          look at, being in appearance nothing but a tiny boat made out of a
          bamboo which has been used to cook rice. Even this is not set
          floating on the river but is simply thrown away under the house.
          Yet through the incantations uttered by the professional
          wailing-woman the bark is wafted away to the spirit world and is
          there converted into a large war-canoe. Gladly the ghosts embark
          and sail away as soon as the final summons comes. It always comes
          in the evening, for it is then that the wailer begins to croon her
          mournful ditties; but the way is so long that the spirits do not
          arrive in the house till the day is breaking. To refresh them after
          their weary journey a bamboo full of rice-spirit awaits them; and
          this they partake of by deputy, for a brave old man, who does not
          fear the face of ghosts, quaffs the beverage in their stead amid
          the joyful shouts of the spectators. On the morning after the feast
          the living pay the last offices of respect to the dead. Monuments
          made of ironwood, the little bamboo articles, and food of all kinds
          are set upon the graves. In consideration of these gifts the ghosts
          now relinquish all claims on their surviving relatives, and
          henceforth earn their own living by the sweat of their brow. Before
          they take their final departure they come to eat and drink in the
          house for the last time.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116"

          or at least to prevent their ghosts from returning to infest and
          importune the living. The same is perhaps the intention of the

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Nagas of Manipur, in Assam, celebrate
          every year about the end of January. At this great feast the dead
          are represented by living men, chosen on the ground of their
          likeness to the departed, who are decked with ornaments and treated
          as if they were in truth the deceased persons come to life again.
          In that character they dance together in the large open space of
          the village, they are fed by the female relations, and they go from
          house to house, receiving presents of cloth. The festival lasts ten
          days, but the great day is the ninth. Huge torches of pinewood are
          made ready to be used that evening when darkness has fallen. The
          time of departure of the dead is at hand. Their living
          representatives are treated to a last meal in the houses, and they
          distribute farewell presents to the sorrowing kinsfolk, who have
          come to bid them good-bye. When the sun has set, a procession is
          formed. At the head of it march men holding aloft the flaring,
          sputtering torches. Then follow the elders armed and in martial
          array, and behind them stalk the representatives of the dead, with
          the relations of the departed crowding and trooping about them.
          Slowly and mournfully the sad procession moves, with loud
          lamentations, through the darkness to a spot at the north end of
          the village which is overshadowed by a great tree. The light of the
          torches is to guide the souls of the dead to their place of rest;
          the warlike array of the elders is to guard them from the perils
          and dangers of the way. At the village boundary the procession
          stops and the torch-bearers throw down their torches. At the same
          moment the spirits of the dead are believed to pass into the dying
          flambeaux and in that guise to depart to the far country. There is
          therefore no further need for their living representatives, who are
          accordingly stripped of all their finery on the spot. When the
          people return home, each family is careful to light a pine torch
          and set it burning on a stone in the house just inside the front
          door; this they do as a precaution to prevent their own souls from
          following the spirits of the dead to the other world. The expense
          of thus despatching the dead to their long home is very great; when
          the head of a family dies, debts may be incurred and rice-fields
          and houses sold to defray the cost of carriage. Thus <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Oraons or
          Uraons of Bengal feast their dead every year on a day in January.
          This ceremony is called the Great Marriage, because by it the bones
          of the deceased are believed to be mysteriously reunited to each
          other. The Oraons treat the bones of the dead differently according
          to the dates of their death in the agricultural year. The bones of
          those who died before the seeds have sprouted in the fields are
          burnt, and the few charred bones which have not been reduced to
          ashes are gathered in an earthen pot. With the bones in the pot are
          placed offerings of rice, native gin, and money, and then they
          carry the urn to the river, where the bones of their forefathers
          repose. But the bones of all who die after the seeds have sprung up
          and before the end of harvest may not be taken to the river,
          because the people believe that were that to be done the crops
          would suffer. These bones are therefore put away in a pot under a
          stone near the house till the harvest is over. Then on the
          appointed day in January they are all collected. A banquet is given
          in honour of the dead, and then both men and women form a
          procession to accompany the bones to their last resting-place in
          the sands of the river. But first the relics of mortality are
          carried from house to house in the village, and each family pours
          rice and gin into the urn which contains the bones of its dead.
          Then the procession sets out for the river, men and women dancing,
          singing, beating drums, and weeping, while the earthen pots
          containing the bones are passed from hand to hand and dance with
          the jigging steps of the dancers. When they are yet some way from
          the spot, the bearers of the urns run forward and bury them in the
          sand of the river. When the rest come up, they all bathe and the
          Great Marriage is over.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href=

          It is believed that during this fortnight it is the practice of all
          the departed to come and visit their relatives. The homes are
          therefore cleaned, and the spaces in front of the house are
          plastered and painted in order to be pleasing to those who are

          date on which they went away. A father who left on the fourth, be
          it the fourth of the dark half or the light half of the moon, will
          return to visit his family on the fourth of the Fortnight of the
          Manes. On that day cakes are prepared, and with certain ceremony
          these are offered to the unseen hovering spirit. Their implicit
          belief is that the spirit will partake of the essence of the food,
          and that which remains—the material portion—may be eaten by members
          of the family. The souls of women, it is said, will all come on the
          ninth of the fortnight. On the thirteenth come those who have met
          with a violent death and who lost their lives by a fall, by
          snake-bite, or any other unusual cause. During the Fortnight of the
          Manes a woman is not supposed to put on new bangles and a man is
          not permitted to shave. In short, this is a season of sad

          Call them all to eat and drink.”</span> The ghosts having finished
          their repast, the people dry their tears and sit down to eat what
          is left. More food is then prepared and put into a basket, and at
          cock-crow next morning the contents of the basket are thrown out of
          the house, while the living weep and call upon their dead as

          Hkamies, a hill tribe of North Aracan, hold an important festival
          every year in honour of departed spirits. It falls after harvest
          and is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the opening of the house of
          the dead.”</span> When a person dies and has been burnt, the ashes
          are collected and placed in a small house in the forest together
          with his spear or gun, which has first been broken. These little
          huts are generally arranged in groups near a village, and are
          sometimes large enough to be mistaken for one. After harvest all
          the relations of the deceased cook various kinds of food and take
          them with pots of liquor distilled from rice to the village of the
          dead. There they open the doors of the houses, and having placed
          the food and drink inside they shut them again. After that they
          weep, eat, drink, and return home.<a id="noteref_121" name=

          festival of the dead in Cambodia takes place on the last day of the
          month Phatrabot (September-October), but ever since the moon began
          to wane everybody has been busy preparing for it. In every house
          cakes and sweetmeats are set out, candles burn, incense sticks
          smoke, and the whole is offered to the ancestral shades with an
          invocation which is thrice repeated: <span class="tei tei-q">“O all

          Fifteen days afterwards many little boats are made of bark and
          filled with rice, cakes, small coins, smoking incense sticks, and
          lighted candles. At evening these are set floating on the river,
          and the souls of the dead embark in them to return to their own
          place. The living now bid them farewell. <span class=

          you will return, you will return.”</span> The river is now covered
          with twinkling points of fire. But the current soon bears them

          Tonquin, as in Sumba, the dead revisit their kinsfolk and their old
          homes at the New Year. From the hour of midnight, when the New Year
          begins, no one dares to shut the door of his house for fear of
          excluding the ghosts, who begin to arrive at that time.
          Preparations have been made to welcome and refresh them after their
          long journey. Beds and mats are ready for their weary bodies to
          repose upon, water to wash their dusty feet, slippers to comfort
          them, and canes to support their feeble steps. Candles burn on the
          domestic altar, and pastilles diffuse a fragrant odour. The people
          bow before the unseen visitors and beseech them to remember and
          bless their descendants in the coming year. Having discharged this
          pious duty they abstain from sweeping the houses for three days
          lest the dust should incommode the ghosts.<a id="noteref_123" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Annam one of
          the most important festivals of the year is the festival of Têt,
          which falls on the first three days of the New Year. It is devoted
          to the worship of ancestors. Everybody, even the poorest, must
          provide a good meal for the souls of his dead at this time and must
          himself eat and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg
          063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          drink heartily. Some families, in order to discharge this pious
          duty, run into debt for the whole year. In the houses everything is
          put in order, washed, and scoured for the reception of the dear and
          distinguished guests. A tall bamboo pole is set up in the front of
          every house and allowed to stand there for seven days. A small
          basket containing areca, betel, and leaves of gilt paper is
          fastened to the pole. The erection of the pole is a sacred rite
          which no family omits to perform, though why they do so few people
          can say. Some, however, allege that the posts are intended to guide
          the ancestral spirits to their old homes. The ceremony of the
          reception of the shades takes place at nightfall on the last day of
          the year. The house of the head of the family is then decked with
          flowers, and in the room which serves as a domestic chapel the
          altar of the ancestors is surrounded with flowers, among which the
          lotus, the emblem of immortality, is most conspicuous. On a table
          are set red candles, perfumes, incense, sandal-wood, and plates
          full of bananas, oranges, and other fruits. The relations crouch
          before the altar, and kneeling at the foot of it the head of the
          house invokes the name of the family which he represents. Then in
          solemn tones he recites an incantation, mentioning the names of his
          most illustrious ancestors and marking time with the strokes of a
          hammer upon a gong, while crackers are exploded outside the room.
          After that, he implores the ancestral shades to protect their
          descendants and invites them to a repast, which is spread for them
          on a table. Round this table he walks, serving the invisible guests
          with his own hands. He distributes to them smoking balls of rice in
          little china saucers, and pours tea or spirits into each little
          cup, while he murmurs words of invitation and compliment. When the
          ghosts have eaten and drunk their fill, the head of the family
          returns to the altar and salutes them for the last time. Finally,
          he takes leaves of yellow paper, covered with gold and silver
          spangles, and throws them into a brazier placed at the foot of the
          ancestral tablets. These papers represent imaginary bars of gold
          and silver which the living send to the dead. Cardboard models of
          houses, furniture, jewels, clothes, of everything in short that the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name=

          the other world, are despatched to them in like manner in the
          flames. Then the family sits down to table and feasts on the
          remains of the ghostly banquet.<a id="noteref_124" name=

          is not merely the spirits of ancestors who are thus feasted and
          supplied with all the necessaries of life. The poor ghosts of those
          who died without leaving descendants or whose bodies were left
          unburied are not forgotten by the pious Annamites. But these
          spirits come round at a different time of year from the others. The
          seventh month of the year is set apart for expiatory sacrifices
          destined to benefit these unhappy beings, and that is why in Annam
          nobody should marry or be betrothed in that month. The great day of
          the month is the fifteenth, which is called the Festival of the
          Souls. On that day the ghosts in question are set free by the lord
          of the underworld, and they come prowling about among the living.
          They are exceedingly dangerous, especially to children. Hence in
          order to appease their wrath and prevent them from entering the
          houses every family takes care to put out offerings for them in the
          street. Before every house on that night you may see candles
          lighted, paper garments of many colours, paper hats, paper boots,
          paper furniture, ingots of gold and silver paper, all hanging in
          tempting array from a string, while plates of food and cups of tea
          and rice-spirit stand ready for the use of hungry and thirsty
          souls. The theory is that the ghosts will be so busy consuming the
          victuals, appropriating the deceitful riches, and trying on the
          paper coats, hats, and boots that they will have neither the
          leisure nor the inclination to intrude upon the domestic circle
          indoors. At seven o'clock in the evening fire is put to the
          offerings, and the paper wardrobe, furniture, and money soon vanish
          crackling in the flames. At the same moment, peeping in at a door
          or window, you may see the domestic ancestral altar brilliantly
          illuminated. As for the food, it is supposed to be thrown on the
          fire or on the ground for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          the ancestral spirits are similarly propitiated and fed on the
          first day of the New Year. The tablets which represent them are
          placed on the domestic altar, and the family prostrate themselves
          before these emblems of the departed. The head of the family lights
          sticks of incense on the altar and prays the shades of his
          forefathers to accept the offerings and be favourable to their
          descendants. With great gravity he waits upon the ghosts, passing
          dishes of food before the ancestral tablets and pouring out wine
          and tea to slake the thirst of the spirits. When the dead are
          supposed to be satisfied with the shadowy essence of the food, the
          living partake of its gross material substance.<a id="noteref_126"

          for three days in every year, and the lamps which the Japanese
          kindle in multitudes on that occasion to light the spirits on their
          way have procured for the festival the name of the Feast of

          two days in the house the beer which was devoted to the dead is

          celebrating an annual Feast of All Souls, which has come down to us
          from a dateless antiquity and is still observed year by year, with
          rites of primitive simplicity, in some parts of Europe. Such a
          festival was held every year in spring by the old Iranians. The
          celebration fell at the end of the year and lasted ten days, namely
          the last five days of the last month and the five following
          supplementary days, which were regularly inserted to make up a year
          of three hundred and sixty-five days; for the old Iranian, like the
          old Egyptian, year was a vague year of twelve months of thirty days
          each, with five supplementary days added at the end for the sake of
          bringing it into apparent, though not real, harmony with the sun's
          annual course in the sky. According to one calculation the ten days
          of the festival corresponded to the last days of February, but
          according to another they fell in March; in later ages the Parsees
          assigned them to the time of the spring equinox. The name of the
          festival was Hamaspathmaedaya.<a id="noteref_134" name=

          learn that on the ten nights of the festival the souls of the dead
          (the Fravashis) were believed to go about the village asking the
          people to do them reverence, to pray to them, to meditate on them,
          and to furnish them with meat and clothes, while at the same time
          they promised that blessings should rest on the pious householder

          Arab geographer Albiruni, who flourished about the year one
          thousand of our era, tells us that among the Persians of his time
          the last five days of the month Aban were called Farwardajan.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“During this time,”</span> he says,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“people put food in the halls of the dead
          and drink on the roofs of the houses, believing that the spirits of
          their dead during these days come out from the places of their
          reward or their punishment, that they go to the dishes laid out for
          them, imbibe their strength and suck their taste. They fumigate
          their houses with juniper, that the dead may enjoy its smell. The
          spirits of the pious men dwell among their families, children, and
          relations, and occupy themselves with their affairs, although
          invisible to them.”</span> He adds that there was a controversy
          among the Persians as to the date of this festival of the dead,
          some maintaining that the five days during which it lasted were the
          last five days of the month Aban, whereas others held that they
          were the five supplementary days which were inserted between the
          months Aban and Adhar. The dispute, he continues, was settled by
          the adoption of all ten days for the celebration of the
          feast.<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href=

          as to the annual return of the dead survive to this day in many
          parts of Europe and find expression in similar customs. The day of
          the dead or of All Souls, as we call it, is commonly the second of
          November. Thus in Lower Brittany the souls of the departed come to
          visit the living on the eve of that day. After vespers are over,
          the priests and choir walk in procession, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the procession of the charnel-house,”</span> chanting
          a weird dirge in the Breton tongue. Then the people go home, gather
          round the fire, and talk of the departed. The housewife covers the
          kitchen table with a white cloth, sets out cider, curds, and hot
          pancakes on it, and retires with the family to rest. The fire on
          the hearth is kept up by a huge log known as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the log of the dead”</span> (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kef ann
          Anaon</span></span>). Soon doleful voices outside in the darkness
          break the stillness of night. It is the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“singers of death”</span> who go about the streets
          waking the sleepers by a wild and melancholy song, in which they
          remind the living in their comfortable beds to pray for the poor
          souls in pain. All that night the dead warm themselves at the
          hearth and feast on the viands prepared for them. Sometimes the
          awe-struck listeners hear the stools creaking in the kitchen, or
          the dead leaves outside rustling under the ghostly footsteps.<a id=

          the Vosges Mountains on All Souls' Eve the solemn sound of the
          church bells invites good Christians to pray for the repose of the
          dead. While the bells are ringing, it is customary in some families
          to uncover the beds and open the windows, doubtless in order to let
          the poor souls enter and rest. No one that evening would dare to
          remain deaf to the appeal of the bells. The prayers are prolonged
          to a late hour of the night. When the last <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          profundis</span></span> has been uttered, the head of the family
          gently covers up the beds, sprinkles them with holy water, and
          shuts the windows. In some villages fire is kept up on the hearth
          and a basket of nuts is placed beside it for the use of the
          ghosts.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Bruges,
          Dinant, and other towns of Belgium holy candles burn all night in
          the houses on the Eve of All Souls, and the bells toll till
          midnight, or even till morning. People, too, often set lighted
          candles on the graves. At Scherpenheuvel the houses are
          illuminated, and the people walk in procession carrying lighted
          candles in their hands. A very common custom in Belgium is to eat
          <span class="tei tei-q">“soul-cakes”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“soul-bread”</span> on the eve or the day of All Souls.
          The eating of them is believed to benefit the dead in some way.
          Perhaps originally, as among the Esquimaux of Alaska to this
          day,<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href=

          ghosts were thought to enter into the bodies of their relatives and
          so to share the victuals which the survivors consumed. Similarly at
          festivals in honour of the dead in Northern India it is customary
          to feed Brahmans, and the food which these holy men partake of is
          believed to pass to the deceased and to refresh their languid
          spirits.<a id="noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a> The
          same idea of eating and drinking by proxy may perhaps partly
          explain many other funeral feasts. Be that as it may, at Dixmude
          and elsewhere in Belgium they say that you deliver a soul from
          Purgatory for every cake you eat. At Antwerp they give a local
          colour to the soul-cakes by baking them with plenty of saffron, the
          deep yellow tinge being suggestive of the flames of Purgatory.
          People in Antwerp at the same season are careful not to slam doors
          or windows for fear of hurting the ghosts.<a id="noteref_142" name=

          district of Southern Bavaria which extends along the valley of the
          Lech from its source to near the point where the river flows into
          the Danube, the two festivals of All Saints and All Souls, on the
          first <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name=
          "Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and second of
          November, have significantly fused in popular usage into a single
          festival of the dead. In fact, the people pay little or no heed to
          the saints and give all their thoughts to the souls of their
          departed kinsfolk. The Feast of All Souls begins immediately after
          vespers on All Saints' Day. Even on the eve of All Saints' Day,
          that is, on the thirty-first of October, which we call Hallowe'en,
          the graveyard is cleaned and every grave adorned. The decoration
          consists in weeding the mounds, sprinkling a layer of charcoal on
          the bare earth, and marking out patterns on it in red
          service-berries. The marigold, too, is still in bloom at that
          season in cottage gardens, and garlands of its orange blooms,
          mingled with other late flowers left by the departing summer, are
          twined about the grey mossgrown tombstones. The basin of holy water
          is filled with fresh water and a branch of box-wood put into it;
          for box-wood in the popular mind is associated with death and the
          dead. On the eve of All Souls' Day the people begin to visit the
          graves and to offer the soul-cakes to the hungry souls. Next
          morning, before eight o'clock, commence the vigil, the requiem, and
          the solemn visitation of the graves. On that day every household
          offers a plate of meal, oats, and spelt on a side-altar in the
          church; while in the middle of the sacred edifice a bier is set,
          covered with a pall, and surrounded by lighted tapers and vessels
          of holy water. The tapers burnt on that day and indeed generally in
          services for the departed are red. In the evening people go,
          whenever they can do so, to their native village, where their dear
          ones lie in the churchyard; and there at the graves they pray for
          the poor souls, and leave an offering of soul-cakes also on a
          side-altar in the church. The soul-cakes are baked of dough in the
          shape of a coil of hair and are made of all sizes up to three feet
          long. They form a perquisite of the sexton.<a id="noteref_143"

          bended knees for their repose. On the graves, too, lights are
          kindled, vessels of holy water placed, and food deposited for the
          refreshment of the souls. All over the Upper Palatinate on All

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Germans of
          Bohemia observe All Souls' Day with much solemnity. Each family
          celebrates the memory of its dead. On the eve of the day it is
          customary to eat cakes and to drink cold milk for the purpose of
          cooling the poor souls who are roasting in purgatory; from which it
          appears that spirits feel the soothing effect of victuals consumed
          vicariously by their friends on earth. The ringing of the church
          bells to prayer on that evening is believed to be the signal at
          which the ghosts, released from the infernal gaol, come trooping to
          the old familiar fire-side, there to rest from their pangs for a
          single night. So in many places people fill a lamp with butter,
          light it, and set it on the hearth, that with the butter the poor
          ghosts may anoint the burns they have received from the sulphureous
          and tormenting flames of purgatory. Next morning the chime of the
          church bells, ringing to early mass, is the knell that bids the
          souls return to their place of pain; but such as have completed
          their penance take flight to heaven. So on the eve of All Saints'
          Day each family gathers in the parlour or the kitchen, speaks
          softly of those they have lost, recalls what they said and did in
          life, and prays for the repose of their souls. While the prayer is
          being said, the children kindle little wax lights which have been
          specially bought for the purpose that day. Next morning the
          families go to church, where mass is celebrated for the dead; then
          they wend their way to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          "tei tei-anchor"></a> churchyard, where they deck the graves of
          their kinsfolk with flowers and wreaths and set little lights upon
          them. This custom of illumining the graves and decking them with
          flowers on the Eve or Day of All Souls is common all over Bohemia;
          it is observed in Prague as well as in the country, by Czechs as
          well as by Germans. In some Czech villages four-cornered cakes of a
          special sort, baked of white wheaten meal with milk, are eaten on
          All Souls' Day or given to beggars that they may pray for the
          dead.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href=

          the Germans of Western Bohemia poor children go from house to house
          on All Souls' Day, begging for soul-cakes, and when they receive
          them they pray God to bless all poor souls. In the southern
          districts every farmer used to grind a great quantity of corn
          against the day and to bake it into five or six hundred little
          black soul-cakes which he gave away to the poor who came begging
          for them.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href=

          rich people treat the poor to bean-soup on that day. Others put

          inscriptions are carved and shine out in the darkness. If any child
          steals a turnip-lantern or anything else from a grave, the
          indignant ghost who has been robbed appears to the thief the same
          night and reclaims his stolen property. A relic of the old custom

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Letts used
          to entertain and feed the souls of the dead for four weeks from
          Michaelmas (September 29) to the day of St. Simon and St. Jude
          (October 28). They called the season <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Wellalaick</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          holy that while it lasted they would not willingly thresh the corn,
          alleging that grain threshed at that time would be useless for
          sowing, since the souls of the dead would not allow it to sprout.
          But we may suspect that the original motive of the abstinence was a
          fear lest the blows of the flails should fall upon the poor ghosts
          swarming in the air. At this season the people were wont to prepare
          food of all sorts for the spirits and set it on the floor of a
          room, which had been well heated and swept for the purpose. Late in
          the evening the master of the house went into the room, tended the
          fire, and called upon his dead kinsfolk by their names to come and
          eat and drink. If he saw the ghosts, he would die within the year;
          but if <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg
          075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          he did not see them he would outlive it. When he thought the souls
          had eaten and drunk enough, he took the staff which served as a
          poker and laying it on the threshold cut it in two with an axe. At
          the same time he bade the spirits go their way, charging them to
          keep to the roads and paths and not to tread upon the rye. If the
          crops turned out ill next year, the people laid the failure at the
          door of the ghosts, who fancied themselves scurvily treated and had
          taken their revenge by trampling down the corn.<a id="noteref_152"

          Samagitians annually invited the dead to come from their graves and
          enjoy a bath and a feast. For their entertainment they prepared a
          special hut, in which they set out food and drink, together with a
          seat and a napkin for every soul who had been invited. They left
          the souls to revel by themselves for three days in the hut; then
          they deposited the remains of the banquet on the graves and bade
          the ghosts farewell. The good things, however, were usually
          consumed by charcoal burners in the forest. This feast of the dead
          fell early in November.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href=

          cock-crow, and depart at the second, being ceremoniously lighted

          which is heated by a stove. Then they go out to meet their
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name=

          table in succession. Then the master of the house bids them warm
          themselves at the stove, remarking that they must have grown cold
          in the damp earth. After that the living guests sit down to eat at
          the tables. Towards the end of the meal the host opens the window
          and lets the ghosts gently out of it by means of the shroud in
          which they were lowered into the grave. As they slide down it from
          the warm room into the outer air, the people tell them,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Now it is time for you to go home, and

          memorial festivals of the dead every year, one in autumn and the

          brewed, and potato scones baked in every house. All the members of
          a clan, who trace their descent through women from one mythical
          ancestress, assemble in a single house, generally in one which lies
          at the boundary of the clan land. Here an old man moulds wax
          candles; and when the requisite number is made he sticks them on
          the shelf of the stove, and begins to mention the dead relations of
          the master of the house by name. For each of them he crumbles a
          piece of bread, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg
          077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          gives each of them a piece of pancake, pours koumiss and beer, and
          puts a spoonful of soup into a trough made for the purpose. All
          persons present whose parents are dead follow his example. The dogs
          are then allowed to eat out of the trough. If they eat quietly, it
          is a sign that the dead live at peace; if they do not eat quietly,
          it argues the contrary. Then the company sit down to table and
          partake of the meal. Next morning both the dead and the living
          refresh themselves with a drink, and a fowl is boiled. The
          proceedings are the same as on the evening before. But now they
          treat the souls for the last time as a preparation for their
          journey, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“Eat, drink, and go home
          to your companions. Live at peace, be gracious to us, keep our
          children, guard our corn, our beasts and birds.”</span> Then the
          people banquet and indulge in all sorts of improprieties. The women
          refrain from feasting until the dead have taken their departure;
          but when the souls are gone, there is no longer any motive for
          abstinence, the koumiss circulates freely among the women, and they
          grow wanton. Yet at this, as at every other festival, the men and
          women eat in different parts of the room.<a id="noteref_157" name=

          to visit their homes that night, the Eve of All Souls, and they
          need lights to show them the way. For their use, too, lights are
          kept burning in the houses all night. Before people go to sleep
          they place on the table a lighted lamp or candle and a frugal meal
          of bread and water. The dead issue from their graves and stalk in

          reciting a ditty peculiar to the day, and looking for a dole of
          cakes, broken victuals, ale, apples, or money. The two latter are

          practice of <span class="tei tei-q">“souling”</span> appears to
          have prevailed especially in the English counties which border on
          Wales. In many parts of Wales itself down to the first half of the
          nineteenth century poor peasants used to go about begging for bread
          on All Souls' Day. The bread bestowed on them was called
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bara
          ran</span></span> or dole-bread. <span class="tei tei-q">“This

          However, the custom was not confined to the west of England, for at
          Whitby in Yorkshire down to the early part of the nineteenth
          century it was usual to make <span class="tei tei-q">“soul mass
          loaves”</span> on or about All Souls' Day. They were small round
          loaves, sold by bakers at a farthing apiece, chiefly for presents
          to children. In former times people used to keep one or two of them
          for good luck.<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same mode of
          celebrating All Souls' Day has been transported by Catholicism to
          the New World and imparted to the aborigines of that continent.
          Thus in Carchi, a province of Ecuador, the Indians prepare foods of
          various sorts against All Souls' Day, and when the day has come
          they take some of the provisions to the church and there deposit
          them on tables set out for the purpose. These good things are the
          perquisite of the priest, who celebrates mass for the dead. After
          the service the Indians repair to the cemetery, where with burning
          candles and pots of holy water they prostrate themselves before the
          tombs of their relations, while the priest or the sacristan recites
          prayers for the souls of the departed. In the evening the Indians
          return to their houses. A table with four lights on it is spread
          with food and drink, especially with such things as the dead loved
          in their life. The door is left open all night, no doubt to let the
          spirits of the dead enter, and the family sits up, keeping the
          invisible guests company through the long hours of darkness. From
          seven o'clock and onwards troops of children traverse the village
          and its neighbourhood. They go from house to house ringing a bell
          and crying, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are angels, we descend from
          the sky, we ask for bread.”</span> The people go to their doors and
          beg the children to recite a <span lang="la" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Pater Noster</span></span> or an <span lang=
          "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ave Maria</span></span> for the dead whom they
          name. When the prayer has been duly said, they give the children a
          little of the food from the table. All night long this goes on,
          band succeeding band of children. At five o'clock in the morning
          the family consumes the remainder of the food of the souls.<a id=

          the children going from door to door during the night of All Souls
          appear to personate the souls of the dead who are also abroad at
          that time; hence to give bread to the children is the same thing as
          to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name=

          giving of soul-cakes to children and the poor on All Souls' Day in
          Europe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A comparison of
          these European customs with the similar heathen rites can leave no
          room for doubt that the nominally Christian feast of All Souls is
          nothing but an old pagan festival of the dead which the Church,
          unable or unwilling to suppress, resolved from motives of policy to
          connive at. But whence did it borrow the practice of solemnizing
          the festival on that particular day, the second of November? In
          order to answer this question we should observe, first, that
          celebrations of this sort are often held at the beginning of a New
          Year,<a id="noteref_168" name="noteref_168" href=
          "#note_168"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">168</span></span></a> and,
          second, that the peoples of North-Western Europe, the Celts and the
          Teutons, appear to have dated the beginning of their year from the
          beginning of winter, the Celts reckoning it from the first of
          November<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href=
          "#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a> and
          the Teutons from the first of October.<a id="noteref_170" name=
          "noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a> The
          difference of reckoning may be due to a difference of climate, the
          home of the Teutons in Central and Northern Europe being a region
          where winter sets in earlier than on the more temperate and humid
          coasts of the Atlantic, the home of the Celts. These considerations
          suggest that the festival of All Souls on the second of November
          originated with the Celts, and spread from them to the rest of the
          European peoples, who, while they preserved their old feasts of the
          dead practically unchanged, may have transferred them to the second
          of November. This conjecture is supported by what we know of the
          ecclesiastical institution, or rather recognition, of the festival.
          For <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name=
          "Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that recognition was
          first accorded at the end of the tenth century in France, a Celtic
          country, from which the Church festival gradually spread over
          Europe. It was Odilo, abbot of the great Benedictine monastery of
          Clugny, who initiated the change in 998 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> by ordering that in
          all the monasteries over which he ruled, a solemn mass should be
          celebrated on the second of November for all the dead who sleep in
          Christ. The example thus set was followed by other religious
          houses, and the bishops, one after another, introduced the new
          celebration into their dioceses. Thus the festival of All Souls
          gradually established itself throughout Christendom, though in fact
          the Church has never formally sanctioned it by a general edict nor
          attached much weight to its observance. Indeed, when objections
          were raised to the festival at the Reformation, the ecclesiastical
          authorities seemed ready to abandon it.<a id="noteref_171" name=
          "noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> These
          facts are explained very simply by the theory that an old Celtic
          commemoration of the dead lingered in France down to the end of the
          tenth century, and was then, as a measure of policy and a
          concession to ineradicable paganism, at last incorporated in the
          Catholic ritual. The consciousness of the heathen origin of the
          practice would naturally prevent the supreme authorities from
          insisting strongly on its observance. They appear rightly to have
          regarded it as an outpost which they could surrender to the forces
          of rationalism without endangering the citadel of the faith.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps we may
          go a step further and explain in like manner the origin of the
          feast of All Saints on the first of November. For the analogy of
          similar customs elsewhere would lead us to suppose that the old
          Celtic festival of the dead was held on the Celtic New Year's Day,
          that is, on the first, not the second, of November. May not then
          the institution of the feast of All Saints on that day have been
          the first attempt of the Church to give a colour of Christianity to
          the ancient heathen rite by substituting the saints for the souls
          of the dead as the true object of worship? <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> The facts of history seem to countenance this
          hypothesis. For the feast of All Saints was instituted in France
          and Germany by order of the Emperor Lewis the Pious in 835
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, that is, about a
          hundred and sixty years before the introduction of the feast of All
          Souls. The innovation was made by the advice of the pope, Gregory
          IV., whose motive may well have been that of suppressing an old
          pagan custom which was still notoriously practised in France and
          Germany. The idea, however, was not a novel one, for the testimony
          of Bede proves that in Britain, another Celtic country, the feast
          of All Saints on the first of November was already celebrated in
          the eighth century.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href=
          "#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> We
          may conjecture that this attempt to divert the devotion of the
          faithful from the souls of the dead to the saints proved a failure,
          and that finally the Church reluctantly decided to sanction the
          popular superstition by frankly admitting a feast of All Souls into
          the calendar. But it could not assign the new, or rather the old,
          festival to the old day, the first of November, since that was
          already occupied by the feast of All Saints. Accordingly it placed
          the mass for the dead on the next day, the second of November. On
          this theory the feasts of All Saints and of All Souls mark two
          successive efforts of the Catholic Church to eradicate an old
          heathen festival of the dead. Both efforts failed. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“In all Catholic countries the day of All Souls has
          preserved the serious character of a festival of the dead which no
          worldly gaieties are allowed to disturb. It is then the sacred duty
          of the survivors to visit the graves of their loved ones in the
          churchyard, to deck them with flowers and lights, and to utter a
          devout prayer—a pious custom with which in cities like Paris and
          Vienna even the gay and frivolous comply for the sake of
          appearance, if not to satisfy an impulse of the

          accompanying illumination of the houses, was a night of All Souls,
          when the ghosts of the dead swarmed in the streets and revisited
          their old homes, which were lit up to welcome them back again.
          Herodotus, who briefly describes the festival, omits to mention its
          date, but we can determine it with some probability from other
          sources. Thus Plutarch tells us that Osiris was murdered on the
          seventeenth of the month Athyr, and that the Egyptians accordingly
          observed mournful rites for four days from the seventeenth of
          Athyr.<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href=

          corresponded to the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and
          sixteenth of November, and this date answers exactly to the other
          indications given by Plutarch, who says that at the time of the
          festival the Nile was sinking, the north winds dying away, the
          nights lengthening, and the leaves falling from the trees. During
          these four days a gilt cow swathed in a black pall was exhibited as
          an image of Isis. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg
          085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          This, no doubt, was the image mentioned by Herodotus in his account
          of the festival.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href=
          "#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a> On
          the nineteenth day of the month the people went down to the sea,
          the priests carrying a shrine which contained a golden casket. Into
          this casket they poured fresh water, and thereupon the spectators
          raised a shout that Osiris was found. After that they took some
          vegetable mould, moistened it with water, mixed it with precious
          spices and incense, and moulded the paste into a small moon-shaped
          image, which was then robed and ornamented.<a id="noteref_176"
          name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> Thus
          it appears that the purpose of the ceremonies described by Plutarch
          was to represent dramatically, first, the search for the dead body
          of Osiris, and, second, its joyful discovery, followed by the
          resurrection of the dead god who came to life again in the new
          image of vegetable mould and spices. Lactantius tells us how on
          these occasions the priests, with their shaven bodies, beat their
          breasts and lamented, imitating the sorrowful search of Isis for
          her lost son Osiris, and how afterwards their sorrow was turned to
          joy when the jackal-headed god Anubis, or rather a mummer in his
          stead, produced a small boy, the living representative of the god
          who was lost and was found.<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177"
          href="#note_177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a> Thus
          Lactantius regarded Osiris as the son instead of the husband of
          Isis, and he makes no mention of the image of vegetable mould. It
          is probable that the boy who figured in the sacred drama played the
          part, not of Osiris, but of his son Horus;<a id="noteref_178" name=
          "noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> but
          as the death and resurrection of the god were celebrated in many
          cities of Egypt, it is also possible that in some places the part
          of the god come to life was played by a living actor instead of by
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name=
          "Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> an image. Another
          Christian writer describes how the Egyptians, with shorn heads,
          annually lamented over a buried idol of Osiris, smiting their
          breasts, slashing their shoulders, ripping open their old wounds,
          until, after several days of mourning, they professed to find the
          mangled remains of the god, at which they rejoiced.<a id=

          However the details of the ceremony may have varied in different
          places, the pretence of finding the god's body, and probably of
          restoring it to life, was a great event in the festal year of the
          Egyptians. The shouts of joy which greeted it are described or
          alluded to by many ancient writers.<a id="noteref_180" name=

          Unfortunately, while the information thus furnished is remarkably
          full and minute on many points, the arrangement adopted in the

          hardly be extracted from it. Moreover, we learn from the document

          festival opened on the twelfth day of Khoiak with a ceremony of
          ploughing and sowing. Two black cows were yoked to the plough,
          which was made of tamarisk wood, while the share was of black
          copper. A boy scattered the seed. One end of the field was sown
          with barley, the other with spelt, and the middle with flax. During

          sycamore wood with a headless human image in its inside.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Then fresh inundation water was poured out

          the twenty-second of Khoiak, at the eighth hour, the images of
          Osiris, attended by thirty-four images of deities, performed a
          mysterious voyage in thirty-four tiny boats made of papyrus, which
          were illuminated by three hundred and sixty-five lights.<a id=

          the twenty-fourth of Khoiak, after sunset, the effigy of Osiris in
          a coffin of mulberry wood was laid in the grave, and at the ninth
          hour of the night the effigy which had been made and deposited the
          year before was removed and placed upon boughs of sycamore.<a id=

          Lastly, on the thirtieth day of Khoiak they repaired to the holy
          sepulchre, a subterranean chamber over which appears to have grown
          a clump of Persea-trees. Entering the vault by the western door,
          they laid the coffined effigy of the dead god reverently on a bed
          of sand in the chamber. So they left him to his rest, and departed
          from the sepulchre by the eastern door. Thus ended the ceremonies

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the foregoing
          account of the festival, drawn from the great inscription of
          Denderah, the burial of Osiris figures prominently, while his
          resurrection is implied rather than expressed. This defect of the
          document, however, is amply compensated by a remarkable series of
          bas-reliefs which accompany and illustrate the inscription. These
          exhibit in a series of scenes the dead god lying swathed as a mummy
          on his bier, then gradually raising himself up higher and higher,
          until at last he has entirely quitted the bier and is seen erect
          between the guardian wings of the faithful Isis, who stands behind
          him, while a male figure holds up before his eyes the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">crux
          ansata</span></span>, the Egyptian symbol of life.<a id=

          resurrection of the god could hardly be portrayed more graphically.
          Even more instructive, however, is another representation of the
          same event in a chamber dedicated to Osiris in the great temple of
          Isis at Philae. Here we see the dead body of Osiris with stalks of
          corn springing from it, while a priest waters the stalks from a
          pitcher which he holds in his hand. The accompanying inscription
          sets forth that <span class="tei tei-q">“this is the form of him
          whom one may not name, Osiris of the mysteries, who springs from
          the returning waters.”</span><a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> Taken
          together, the picture and the words seem to leave no doubt that
          Osiris was here conceived and represented as a personification of
          the corn which springs from <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the fields after they have been fertilized by
          the inundation. This, according to the inscription, was the kernel
          of the mysteries, the innermost secret revealed to the initiated.
          So in the rites of Demeter at Eleusis a reaped ear of corn was
          exhibited to the worshippers as the central mystery of their
          religion.<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> We
          can now fully understand why at the great festival of sowing in the
          month of Khoiak the priests used to bury effigies of Osiris made of
          earth and corn. When these effigies were taken up again at the end
          of a year or of a shorter interval, the corn would be found to have
          sprouted from the body of Osiris, and this sprouting of the grain
          would be hailed as an omen, or rather as the cause, of the growth
          of the crops.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href=

          feed the people: he died that they might live.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And from the
          death and resurrection of their great god the Egyptians drew not
          only their support and sustenance in this life, but also their hope
          of a life eternal beyond the grave. This hope is indicated in the
          clearest manner by the very remarkable effigies of Osiris which
          have come to light in Egyptian cemeteries. Thus in the Valley of
          the Kings at Thebes there was found the tomb of a royal fan-bearer
          who lived about 1500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          contents of the tomb there was a bier on which rested a mattress of
          reeds covered with three layers of linen. On the upper side of the
          linen was painted a life-size figure of Osiris; and the interior of
          the figure, which was waterproof, contained a mixture of vegetable
          mould, barley, and a sticky fluid. The barley had sprouted and sent
          out shoots two or three inches long.<a id="noteref_196" name=

          Again, in the cemetery at Cynopolis <span class="tei tei-q">“were
          numerous burials of Osiris figures. These were made of grain
          wrapped up in cloth and roughly shaped like an Osiris, and placed
          inside a bricked-up recess at the side of the tomb, sometimes
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name=

          Finally, we are told by Professor Erman that between the legs of
          mummies <span class="tei tei-q">“there sometimes lies a figure of
          Osiris made of slime; it is filled with grains of corn, the
          sprouting of which is intended to signify the resurrection of the
          god.”</span><a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href=

          cannot doubt that, just as the burial of corn-stuffed images of
          Osiris in the earth at the festival of sowing was designed to
          quicken the seed, so the burial of similar images in the grave was
          meant to quicken the dead, in other words, to ensure their
          spiritual immortality.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The festival of
          Osiris which Plutarch assigns to the month of Athyr would seem to
          be identical in substance with the one which the inscription of
          Denderah assigns to the following month, namely, to Khoiak.
          Apparently the essence of both festivals was a dramatic
          representation of the death and resurrection of the god; in both of
          them Isis was figured by a gilt cow, and Osiris by an image moulded
          of moist vegetable earth. But if the festivals were the same, why
          were they held in different months? It is easy to suggest that
          different towns in Egypt celebrated the festival at different
          dates. But when we remember that according to the great inscription
          of Denderah, the authority of which is indisputable, the festival
          fell in the month of Khoiak in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> every province of Egypt, we shall be
          reluctant to suppose that at some one place, or even at a few
          places, it was exceptionally held in the preceding month of Athyr,
          and that the usually well-informed Plutarch described the exception
          as if it had been the rule, of which on this supposition he must
          have been wholly ignorant. More probably the discrepancy is to be
          explained by the great change which came over the Egyptian calendar
          between the date of the inscription and the lifetime of Plutarch.
          For when the inscription was drawn up in the Ptolemaic age the
          festivals were dated by the old vague or movable year, and
          therefore rotated gradually through the whole circle of the
          seasons; whereas at the time when Plutarch wrote, about the end of
          the first century, they were seemingly dated by the fixed
          Alexandrian year, and accordingly had ceased to rotate.<a id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even if we
          grant that in Plutarch's day the festivals had become stationary,
          still this would not explain why the old festival of Khoiak had
          been transferred to Athyr. In order to understand that transference
          it seems necessary to suppose that when the Egyptians gave to their
          months fixed places in the solar year by accepting the Alexandrian
          system of intercalation, they at the same time transferred the
          festivals from what may be called their artificial to their natural
          dates. Under the old system a summer festival was sometimes held in
          winter and a winter festival in summer; a harvest celebration
          sometimes fell at the season of sowing, and a sowing celebration at
          the season of harvest. People might reconcile themselves to such
          anomalies so long as they knew that they were only temporary, and
          that in the course of time the festivals would necessarily return
          to their proper seasons. But it must have been otherwise when they
          adopted a fixed instead of a movable year, and so arrested the
          rotation of the festivals for ever. For they could not but be aware
          that every festival would thenceforth continue to occupy for all
          time that particular place in the solar year which it chanced to
          occupy in the year 30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          festivals in summer, they would always be so held in future; the
          absurdity and anomaly would never again be rectified as it had been
          before. This consideration, which could not have escaped
          intelligent men, must have suggested the advisability of

          of discrepancy between the accidental and the natural dates of the
          festivals? It was a little more than a month. In that year Thoth,
          the first month of the Egyptian calendar, happened to begin on the
          twenty-ninth of August,<a id="noteref_202" name="noteref_202" href=

          whereas according to theory it should have begun with the heliacal
          rising of Sirius on the twentieth of July, that is, forty days or,
          roughly speaking, a month earlier. From this it follows that in the
          year 30 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> all the Egyptian
          festivals fell about a month later than their natural dates, and
          they must have continued to fall a month late for ever if they were
          allowed to retain those places in the calendar which they chanced
          to occupy in that particular year. In these circumstances it would
          be a natural and sensible thing to restore the festivals to their
          proper places in the solar year by celebrating them one calendar
          month earlier than before.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203"

          "page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> festivals which had hitherto been held, for
          example, in the third month Athyr would henceforth be held in the
          second month Phaophi; the festivals which had hitherto fallen in
          the fourth month Khoiak would thenceforth fall in the third month
          Athyr; and so on. Thus the festal calendar would be reduced to
          harmony with the seasons instead of being in more or less flagrant
          discord with them, as it had generally been before, and must always
          have been afterwards if the change which I have indicated had not
          been introduced. It is only to credit the native astronomers and
          the Roman rulers of Egypt with common sense to suppose that they
          actually adopted the measure. On that supposition we can perfectly
          understand why the festival of sowing, which had formerly belonged
          to the month of Khoiak, was transferred to Athyr. For in the
          Alexandrian calendar Khoiak corresponds very nearly to December,
          and Athyr to November. But in Egypt the month of November, not the
          month of December, is the season of sowing. There was therefore
          every reason why the great sowing festival of the corn-god Osiris
          should be held in Athyr and not Khoiak, in November and not in
          December. In like manner we may suppose that all the Egyptian
          festivals were restored to their true places in the solar year, and
          that when Plutarch dates a festival both by its calendar month and
          by its relation to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
          095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the cycle of the seasons, he is perfectly right in doing so, and we
          may accept his evidence with confidence instead of having to accuse
          him of ignorantly confounding the movable Egyptian with the fixed
          Alexandrian year. Accusations of ignorance levelled at the best
          writers of antiquity are apt to recoil on those who make
          them.<a id="noteref_204" name="noteref_204" href=

              The legend of the dismemberment of Osiris points to the
              dismemberment of human beings, perhaps of the kings, in the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
          survey of the myth and ritual of Osiris may suffice to prove that
          in one of his aspects the god was a personification of the corn,
          which may be said to die and come to life again every year. Through
          all the pomp and glamour with which in later times the priests had
          invested his worship, the conception of him as the corn-god comes
          clearly out in the festival of his death and resurrection, which
          was celebrated in the month of Khoiak and at a later period in the
          month of Athyr. That festival appears to have been essentially a
          festival of sowing, which properly fell at the time when the
          husbandman actually committed the seed to the earth. On that
          occasion an effigy of the corn-god, moulded of earth and corn, was
          buried with funeral rites in the ground in order that, dying there,
          he might come to life again with the new crops. The ceremony was,
          in fact, a charm to ensure the growth of the corn by sympathetic
          magic, and we may conjecture that as such it was practised in a
          simple form by every Egyptian farmer on his fields long before it
          was adopted and transfigured by the priests in the stately ritual
          of the temple. In the modern, but doubtless ancient, Arab custom of
          burying <span class="tei tei-q">“the Old Man,”</span> namely, a
          sheaf of wheat, in the harvest-field and praying that he may return

          see the germ out of which the worship of the corn-god Osiris was
          probably developed. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg

          more appropriate parentage could be invented for the corn which
          springs from the ground that has been fertilized by the water of
          heaven? It is true that the land of Egypt owed its fertility
          directly to the Nile and not to showers; but the inhabitants must
          have known or guessed that the great river in its turn was fed by
          the rains which fell in the far interior. Again, the legend that
          Osiris was the first to teach men the use of corn<a id=
          "noteref_207" name="noteref_207" href="#note_207"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">207</span></span></a> would
          be most naturally told of the corn-god himself. Further, the story
          that his mangled remains were scattered up and down the land and
          buried in different places may be a mythical way of expressing
          either the sowing or the winnowing of the grain. The latter
          interpretation is supported by the tale that Isis placed the
          severed limbs of Osiris on a corn-sieve.<a id="noteref_208" name=

          more probably the legend may be a reminiscence of a custom of
          slaying a human victim, perhaps a representative of the
          corn-spirit, and distributing his flesh or scattering his ashes
          over the fields to fertilize them. In modern Europe the figure of
          Death is sometimes torn in pieces, and the fragments are then
          buried in the ground to make the crops grow well,<a id=

          the traditional day of his death, the seventh of July, was
          celebrated with certain curious rites, which were apparently
          connected with the artificial fertilization of the fig.<a id=

          Again, Greek legend told how Pentheus, king of Thebes, and
          Lycurgus, king of the Thracian Edonians, opposed the vine-god
          Dionysus, and how the impious monarchs were rent in pieces, the one
          by the frenzied Bacchanals, the other by horses.<a id="noteref_216"

          Greek traditions may well be distorted reminiscences of a custom of
          sacrificing human beings, and especially divine kings, in the
          character of Dionysus, a god who resembled Osiris in many points
          and was said like him to have been torn limb from limb.<a id=

          since they died the same death as their god, it is reasonable to
          suppose that they personated him. The story that the Thracian
          Orpheus was similarly torn limb from limb by the Bacchanals seems
          to indicate that he too perished in the character of the god whose
          death he died.<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href=

          some Thracian villages at Carnival time a custom is still annually
          observed, which may well be a mitigation of an ancient practice of
          putting a man, perhaps a king, to death in the character of
          Dionysus for the sake of the crops. A man disguised in goatskins
          and fawnskins, the livery of Dionysus, is shot at and falls down as
          dead. A pretence is made of flaying his body and of mourning over
          him, but afterwards he comes to life again. Further, a plough is
          dragged about the village and seed is scattered, while prayers are
          said that the wheat, rye, and barley may be plentiful. One town
          (Viza), where these customs are observed, was the capital of the
          old Thracian kings. In another town (Kosti, near the Black Sea) the
          principal masker is called the king. He wears goatskins or
          sheepskins, and is attended by a boy who dispenses wine to the
          people. The king himself carries seed, which he casts on the ground
          before the church, after being invited to throw it on two
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name=

          the chief men from Raumariki and Westfold and Heithmörk came and
          all requested that they might take his body with them and bury it
          in their various provinces; they thought that it would bring
          abundance to those who obtained it. Eventually it was settled that
          the body was distributed in four places. The head was laid in a
          barrow at Steinn in Hringariki, and each party took away their own
          share and buried it. All these barrows are called Halfdan's

          reared a great mound, and put him in it, and sacrificed to him for

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The natives of
          Kiwai, an island lying off the mouth of the Fly River in British
          New Guinea, tell of a certain magician named Segera, who had sago
          for his totem. When his son died, the death was set down to the
          magic of an enemy, and the bereaved father was so angry that by his
          spells he caused the whole crop of sago in the country to fail;
          only in his own garden the sago grew as luxuriantly as ever. When
          many had died of famine, the people went to him and begged him to
          remove the spells which he had cast on the sago palms, so that they
          might eat food and live. The magician, touched with remorse and
          pity, went round planting a sago shoot in every garden, and the
          shoots flourished, sago was plentiful once more, and the famine
          came to an end. When Segera was old and ill, he told the people
          that he would soon die, but that, nevertheless, he would cause
          their gardens to thrive. Accordingly, he instructed them that when
          he was dead they should cut him up and place pieces of his flesh in
          their gardens, but his head was to be buried in his own garden. Of
          him it is said that he outlived the ordinary age, and that no man
          knew his father, but that he made the sago good and no one was
          hungry any more. Old men who were alive a few years ago affirmed
          that they had known Segera in their youth, and the general opinion
          of the Kiwai people seems to be that Segera died not more than two
          generations ago.<a id="noteref_225" name="noteref_225" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Taken all
          together, these legends point to a widespread practice of

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and burying the pieces in different
          parts of the country in order to ensure the fertility of the ground
          and probably also the fecundity of man and beast. Whether regarded
          as the descendant of a god, as himself divine, or simply as a
          mighty enchanter, the king was believed to radiate magical virtue
          for the good of his subjects, quickening the seed in the earth and
          in the womb. This radiation of reproductive energy did not cease
          with his life; hence the people deemed it essential to preserve his
          body as a pledge of the continued prosperity of the country. It
          would be natural to imagine that the spot where the dead king was
          buried would enjoy a more than ordinary share of his blessed
          influence, and accordingly disputes would almost inevitably arise
          between different districts for the exclusive possession of so
          powerful a talisman. These disputes could be settled and local
          jealousies appeased by dividing the precious body between the rival
          claimants, in order that all should benefit in equal measure by its
          life-giving properties. This was certainly done in Norway with the
          body of Halfdan the Black, the descendant of the harvest-god Frey;
          it appears to have been done with the body of Segera, the
          sago-magician of Kiwai; and we may conjecture that in prehistoric
          times it was done with the bodies of Egyptian kings, who personated
          Osiris, the god of fertility in general and of the corn in
          particular. At least such a practice would account for the legend
          of the mangling of the god's body and the distribution of the
          pieces throughout Egypt.</p>

          in order to compound a fertilizing medicine out of them. But the

          keep watch night and day over his grave. After a time his bones are
          taken up and carried by night to some far-away inaccessible cave in

          are taken down when the bones have been deposited there. Many

          may perhaps have been his primitive character, since the worship of
          trees is naturally older in the history of religion than the
          worship of the cereals. However that may have been, to an
          agricultural people like the Egyptians, who depended almost wholly
          on their crops, the corn-god was naturally a far more important
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name=

          tree-god, and attracted a larger share of their devotion. The

          pine-tree having been cut down, the centre was hollowed out, and
          with the wood thus excavated an image of Osiris was made, which was
          then buried like a corpse in the hollow of the tree. It is hard to
          imagine how the conception of a tree as tenanted by a personal
          being could be more plainly expressed. The image of Osiris thus
          made was kept for a year and then burned, exactly as was done with

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now we know from
          the monuments that at Busiris, Memphis, and elsewhere the great
          festival of Osiris closed on the thirtieth of Khoiak with the
          setting up of a remarkable pillar known as the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tatu</span></span>, <span class=

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ded</span></span>. This was a column with four
          or five cross-bars, like superposed capitals, at the top. The whole
          roughly resembled a telegraph-post with the cross-pieces which
          support the wires. Sometimes on the monuments a human form is given
          to the pillar by carving a grotesque face on it, robing the lower
          part, crowning the top with the symbols of Osiris, and adding two
          arms which hold two other characteristic emblems of the god, the
          crook and the scourge or flail. On a Theban tomb the king himself,
          assisted by his relations and a priest, is represented hauling at
          the ropes by which the pillar is being raised, while the queen
          looks on and her sixteen daughters accompany the ceremony with the
          music of rattles and sistrums. Again, in the hall of the Osirian
          mysteries at Abydos the King Sety I. and the goddess Isis are
          depicted raising the column between them. In Egyptian theology the
          pillar was interpreted as the backbone of Osiris, and whatever its
          meaning <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg
          109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          may have been, it was one of the holiest symbols of the national
          religion. It might very well be a conventional way of representing
          a tree stripped of its leaves; and if Osiris was a tree-spirit, the
          bare trunk and branches might naturally be described as his
          backbone. The setting up of the column would thus, as several
          modern scholars believe, shadow forth the resurrection of the god,
          and the importance of the occasion would explain and justify the
          prominent part which the king appears to have taken in the
          ceremony.<a id="noteref_251" name="noteref_251" href=

          to be noted that in the myth of Osiris the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">erica</span></span>-tree which shot up and
          enclosed his dead body, was cut down by a king and turned by him
          into a pillar of his house.<a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252"

          can hardly doubt, therefore, that this incident of the legend was
          supposed to be dramatically set forth in the erection of the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ded</span></span> column by the king. Like the
          similar custom of cutting a pine-tree and fastening an image to it
          in the rites of Attis, the ceremony may have belonged to that class
          of customs of which the bringing in of the May-pole is among the
          most familiar. The association of the king and queen of Egypt with
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          days upon branches of sycamores. The explanation appended in the
          sacred texts declares that the placing of the image on the tree was
          intended to recall the seven months passed by Osiris in the womb of

          Again, in the series of sculptures which illustrate the mystic
          history of Osiris in the great temple of Isis at Philae, a tamarisk
          is figured with two men pouring water on it. The accompanying
          inscription leaves no doubt, says Brugsch, that the verdure of the
          earth was believed to be connected with the verdure of the tree,
          and that the sculpture refers to the grave of Osiris at Philae, of
          which Plutarch tells us that it was overshadowed by a <span class=

          olive-tree. This sculpture, it may be observed, occurs in the same

          corn springing from him.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a god of
          vegetation Osiris was naturally conceived as a god of creative
          energy in general, since men at a certain stage of evolution fail
          to distinguish between the reproductive powers of animals and of
          plants. Hence a striking feature in his worship was the coarse but
          expressive symbolism by which this aspect of his nature was
          presented to the eye not merely of the initiated but of the
          multitude. At his festival women used to go about the villages
          singing songs in his praise and carrying obscene images of him
          which they set in motion by means of strings.<a id="noteref_273"

          custom was probably a charm to ensure the growth of the crops. A
          similar image of him, decked with all the fruits of the earth, is
          said to have stood in a temple before a figure of Isis,<a id=

          in the chambers dedicated to him at Philae the dead god is
          portrayed lying on his bier in an attitude which indicates in the
          plainest way that even in death his generative virtue was not
          extinct but only suspended, ready to prove a source of life and
          fertility to the world when the opportunity should offer.<a id=

          contain allusions to this important side of his nature. In one of
          them it is said that the world waxes green in triumph through him;
          and another declares, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art the father
          and mother of mankind, they live on thy breath, they subsist on the

          may conjecture that in this paternal aspect he was supposed, like
          other gods of fertility, to bless men and women with offspring, and
          that the processions at his festival were intended to promote this
          object as well as to quicken the seed in the ground. It would be to
          misjudge ancient religion to denounce as lewd and profligate the
          emblems and the ceremonies which the Egyptians employed for the
          purpose of giving effect to this conception of the divine power.
          The ends which they proposed to themselves in these rites were
          natural and laudable; only the means they adopted to compass them
          were mistaken. A similar fallacy induced the Greeks to adopt a like
          symbolism in their Dionysiac festivals, and the superficial but
          striking resemblance thus produced between the two religions has
          perhaps more than anything else misled inquirers, both ancient and
          modern, into identifying worships which, though certainly akin in
          nature, are perfectly distinct and independent in origin.<a id=

          hardly, if at all, less important than his function of making the
          earth to bring forth its fruits in due season. We may assume that
          in the faith of his worshippers the two provinces of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name=
          "Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> god were intimately
          connected. In laying their dead in the grave they committed them to
          his keeping who could raise them from the dust to life eternal,
          even as he caused the seed to spring from the ground. Of that faith
          the corn-stuffed effigies of Osiris found in Egyptian tombs furnish

          were at once an emblem and an instrument of resurrection. Thus from
          the sprouting of the grain the ancient Egyptians drew an augury of
          human immortality. They are not the only people who have built the
          same far-reaching hopes on the same slender foundation.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou fool, that which thou sowest, thou

        late eminent Dutch scholar C. P. Tiele confessed candidly that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“it is now impossible to tell precisely to
        what natural phenomena the character of Isis at first

        Similarly Dr. Budge writes that <span class="tei tei-q">“Isis was the
        great and beneficent goddess and mother, whose influence and love
        pervaded all heaven and earth and the abode of the dead, and she was
        the personification of the great feminine, creative power which
        conceived, and brought forth every living creature and thing, from
        the gods in heaven to man on the earth, and to the insect on the

        and nourished, and she employed her life in using her power
        graciously and successfully, not only in creating new beings but in
        restoring those that were dead. She was, besides these things, the
        highest type of a faithful and loving wife <span class="tei tei-pb"

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in her
        character of a goddess of fecundity Isis answered to the great mother
        goddesses of Asia, though she differed from them in the chastity and
        fidelity of her conjugal life; for while they were unmarried and
        dissolute, she had a husband and was a true wife to him as well as an
        affectionate mother to their son. Hence her beautiful Madonna-like
        figure reflects a more refined state of society and of morals than
        the coarse, sensual, cruel figures of Astarte, Anaitis, Cybele, and
        the rest of that crew. A clear trace, indeed, of an ethical standard
        very different from our own lingers in her double relation of sister
        and wife to Osiris; but in most other respects she is rather late
        than primitive, the full-blown flower rather than the seed of a long
        religious development. The attributes ascribed to her were too
        various to be all her own. They were graces borrowed from many lesser
        deities, sweets rifled from a thousand humbler plants to feed the
        honey of her superb efflorescence. Yet in her complex nature it is
        perhaps still possible to detect the original nucleus round which by
        a slow process of accretion the other elements gathered. For if her
        brother and husband Osiris was in one of his aspects the corn-god, as
        we have seen reason to believe, she must surely have been the
        corn-goddess. There are at least some grounds for thinking so. For if
        we may trust Diodorus Siculus, whose authority appears to have been
        the Egyptian historian Manetho, the discovery of wheat and barley was
        attributed to Isis, and at her festivals stalks of these grains were
        carried in procession to commemorate the boon she had conferred on
        men.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href=
        "#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a> A
        further detail is added by Augustine. He says that Isis made the
        discovery of barley at the moment when she was sacrificing to the
        common ancestors of her husband and herself, all of whom had been
        kings, and that she showed the newly discovered ears of barley to
        Osiris and his councillor Thoth or Mercury, as Roman writers called
        him. That is why, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
        117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        Further, at harvest-time, when the Egyptian reapers had cut the first
        stalks, they laid them down and beat their breasts, wailing and
        calling upon Isis.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such, we may
        suppose, was Isis in the olden time, a rustic Corn-Mother adored with
        uncouth rites by Egyptian swains. But the homely features of the
        clownish goddess could hardly be traced in the refined, the saintly
        form which, spiritualized by ages of religious evolution, she
        presented to her worshippers of after days as the true wife, the
        tender <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name=
        "Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mother, the beneficent
        queen of nature, encircled with the nimbus of moral purity, of
        immemorial and mysterious sanctity. Thus chastened and transfigured
        she won many hearts far beyond the boundaries of her native land. In
        that welter of religions which accompanied the decline of national
        life in antiquity her worship was one of the most popular at Rome and
        throughout the empire. Some of the Roman emperors themselves were
        openly addicted to it.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href=
        "#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> And
        however the religion of Isis may, like any other, have been often
        worn as a cloak by men and women of loose life, her rites appear on
        the whole to have been honourably distinguished by a dignity and
        composure, a solemnity and decorum well fitted to soothe the troubled
        mind, to ease the burdened heart. They appealed therefore to gentle
        spirits, and above all to women, whom the bloody and licentious rites
        of other Oriental goddesses only shocked and repelled. We need not
        wonder, then, that in a period of decadence, when traditional faiths
        were shaken, when systems clashed, when men's minds were disquieted,
        when the fabric of empire itself, once deemed eternal, began to show
        ominous rents and fissures, the serene figure of Isis with her
        spiritual calm, her gracious promise of immortality, should have
        appeared to many like a star in a stormy sky, and should have roused
        in their breasts a rapture of devotion not unlike that which was paid
        in the Middle Ages to the Virgin Mary. Indeed her stately ritual,
        with its shaven and tonsured priests, its matins and vespers, its
        tinkling music, its baptism and aspersions of holy water, its solemn
        processions, its jewelled images of the Mother of God, presented many
        points of similarity to the pomps and ceremonies of
        Catholicism.<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href=
        "#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        resemblance need not be purely accidental. <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class=

        Certainly in art the figure of Isis suckling the infant Horus is so

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Osiris has been
        sometimes interpreted as the sun-god; and in modern times this view
        has been held by so many distinguished writers that it deserves a
        brief examination. If we inquire on what evidence Osiris has been
        identified with the sun or the sun-god, it will be found on analysis
        to be minute in quantity and dubious, where it is not absolutely
        worthless, in quality. The diligent Jablonski, the first modern
        scholar to collect and sift the testimony of classical writers on
        Egyptian religion, says that it can be shown in many ways that Osiris
        is the sun, and that he could produce a cloud of witnesses to prove
        it, but that it is needless to do so, since no learned man is
        ignorant of the fact.<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href=
        "#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> Of the
        writers whom he condescends to quote, the only two who expressly
        identify Osiris with the sun are Diodorus and Macrobius. The passage
        in Diodorus runs thus:<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href=
        "#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is said that the aboriginal inhabitants
        of Egypt, looking up to the sky, and smitten with awe and wonder at
        the nature of the universe, supposed that there were two gods,
        eternal and primaeval, the sun and the moon, of whom they named the
        sun Osiris and the moon Isis.”</span> Even if Diodorus's authority
        for this statement is Manetho, as there is some ground for
        believing,<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href=
        "#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> little
        or no weight can be attached to it. For it is plainly a
        philosophical, and therefore a late, explanation of the first
        beginnings of Egyptian religion, reminding us of Kant's familiar
        saying about the starry heavens and the moral law rather than of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121"
        id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> rude traditions of a primitive
        people. Jablonski's second authority, Macrobius, is no better, but
        rather worse. For Macrobius was the father of that large family of
        mythologists who resolve all or most gods into the sun. According to
        him Mercury was the sun, Mars was the sun, Janus was the sun, Saturn
        was the sun, so was Jupiter, also Nemesis, likewise Pan, and so on
        through a great part of the pantheon.<a id="noteref_305" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a> It was
        natural, therefore, that he should identify Osiris with the
        sun,<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href=
        "#note_306"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">306</span></span></a> but his
        reasons for doing so are exceedingly slight. He refers to the
        ceremonies of alternate lamentation and joy as if they reflected the
        vicissitudes of the great luminary in his course through the sky.
        Further, he argues that Osiris must be the sun because an eye was one
        of his symbols. It is true that an eye was a symbol of Osiris,<a id=
        "noteref_307" name="noteref_307" href="#note_307"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">307</span></span></a> and it
        is also true that the sun was often called <span class=

        coincidence hardly suffices to establish the identity of the two
        deities. The opinion that Osiris was the sun is also mentioned, but
        not accepted, by Plutarch,<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309"

        was both the physical sun and the sun-god is undisputed; but with
        every deference for the authority of so great a scholar as Lepsius,
        we may doubt whether the identification of Osiris with Ra can be
        accepted as proof that Osiris was originally the sun. For the
        religion of ancient Egypt<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href=
        "#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a> may be
        described as a confederacy of local cults which, while maintaining
        against each other a certain measure of jealous and even hostile
        independence, were yet constantly subjected to the fusing and
        amalgamating influence of political centralization and philosophic
        thought. The history of the religion appears to have largely
        consisted of a struggle between these opposite forces or tendencies.
        On the one side there was the conservative tendency to preserve the
        local cults with all their distinctive features, fresh, sharp, and
        crisp as they had been handed down from an immemorial past. On the
        other side there was the progressive tendency, favoured by the
        gradual fusion of the people under a powerful central government,
        first to dull the edge of these provincial distinctions, and finally
        to break them down completely and merge them in a single national
        religion. The conservative party probably mustered in its ranks the
        great bulk of the people, their prejudices and affections being
        warmly enlisted in favour of the local deity, with whose temple and
        rites they had been familiar from childhood; and the popular dislike
        of change, based on the endearing effect of old association, must
        have been strongly reinforced by the less disinterested opposition of
        the local clergy, whose material interests would necessarily suffer
        with any decay of their shrines. On the other hand the kings, whose
        power and glory rose with the political and ecclesiastical
        consolidation of the realm, were the natural champions of religious
        unity; and their efforts would be seconded by the refined and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123"
        id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thoughtful minority, who could
        hardly fail to be shocked by the many barbarous and revolting
        elements in the local rites. As usually happens in such cases, the
        process of religious unification appears to have been largely
        effected by discovering points of similarity, real or imaginary,
        between the provincial deities, which were thereupon declared to be
        only different names or manifestations of the same god.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the deities who
        thus acted as centres of attraction, absorbing in themselves a
        multitude of minor divinities, by far the most important was the
        sun-god Ra. There appear to have been few gods in Egypt who were not
        at one time or other identified with him. Ammon of Thebes, Horus of
        the East, Horus of Edfu, Chnum of Elephantine, Tum of Heliopolis, all
        were regarded as one god, the sun. Even the water-god Sobk, in spite
        of his crocodile shape, did not escape the same fate. Indeed one
        king, Amenophis IV., undertook to sweep away all the old gods at a
        stroke and replace them by a single god, the <span class=

        name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class=

        hymns composed in his honour, this deity is referred to as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the living disc of the sun, besides whom

        <span class="tei tei-q">“who bringeth the years, createth the months,
        maketh the days, calculateth the hours, the lord of time, by whom men
        reckon.”</span> In his zeal for the unity of god, the king commanded
        to erase the names of all other gods from the monuments, and to
        destroy their images. His rage was particularly directed against the
        god Ammon, whose name and likeness were effaced wherever they were
        found; even the sanctity of the tomb was violated in order to destroy
        the memorials of the hated deity. In some of the halls of the great
        temples at Carnac, Luxor, and other places, all the names of the
        gods, with a few chance exceptions, were scratched out. The monarch
        even changed his own name, Amenophis, because it was compounded of
        Ammon, and took instead the name of Chu-en-aten, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“gleam of the sun's disc.”</span> Thebes itself, the
        ancient capital of his glorious ancestors, full of the monuments of
        their piety and idolatry, was no longer a fit home for the puritan
        king. He deserted it, and built for himself a new capital in Middle
        Egypt at the place now known as Tell-el-Amarna. Here in a few years a
        city of palaces and gardens rose like an exhalation at his command,
        and here the king, his dearly loved wife and children, and his
        complaisant courtiers led a merry life. The grave and sombre ritual
        of Thebes was discarded. The sun-god was worshipped with songs and
        hymns, with the music of harps and flutes, with offerings of cakes
        and fruits and flowers. Blood seldom stained his kindly altars. The
        king himself celebrated the offices of religion. He preached with
        unction, and we may be sure that his courtiers listened with at least
        an outward semblance of devotion. From the too-faithful portraits of
        himself which he has bequeathed to us we can still picture to
        ourselves the heretic king in the pulpit, with his tall, lanky
        figure, his bandy legs, his pot-belly, his long, lean, haggard face
        aglow with the fever of religious fanaticism. Yet <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the doctrine,”</span> as he loved to call it, which he
        proclaimed to his hearers was apparently no stern message of
        renunciation in this world, of terrors in the world to <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> come. The thoughts of death, of judgment,
        and of a life beyond the grave, which weighed like a nightmare on the
        minds of the Egyptians, seem to have been banished for a time. Even
        the name of Osiris, the awful judge of the dead, is not once
        mentioned in the graves at Tell-el-Amarna. All this lasted only
        during the life of the reformer. His death was followed by a violent
        reaction. The old gods were reinstated in their rank and privileges:
        their names and images were restored, and new temples were built. But
        all the shrines and palaces reared by the late king were thrown down:
        even the sculptures that referred to him and to his god in rock-tombs
        and on the sides of hills were erased or filled up with stucco: his
        name appears on no later monument, and was carefully omitted from all
        official lists. The new capital was abandoned, never to be inhabited
        again. Its plan can still be traced in the sands of the desert.</p>

        discover the original character of any Egyptian god, no weight can be
        given to the identification of him with other gods, least of all with
        the sun-god Ra. Far from helping to follow up the trail, these
        identifications only cross and confuse it. The best evidence for the
        original character of the Egyptian gods is to be found in their
        ritual and myths, so far as these are known, and in the manner in
        which they are portrayed on the monuments. It is mainly on evidence
        drawn from these sources that I rest my interpretation of Osiris.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ground upon
        which some modern writers seem chiefly to rely for the identification
        of Osiris with the sun is that the story of his death fits better
        with the solar phenomena than with any other in nature. It may
        readily be admitted that the daily appearance and disappearance of
        the sun might very naturally be expressed by a myth of his death and
        resurrection; and writers who regard Osiris as the sun are careful to
        indicate that it is the diurnal, and not the annual, course of the
        sun to which they understand the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> myth to apply. Thus Renouf, who identified
        Osiris with the sun, admitted that the Egyptian sun could not with
        any show of reason be described as dead in winter.<a id="noteref_314"
        name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a> But if
        his daily death was the theme of the legend, why was it celebrated by
        an annual ceremony? This fact alone seems fatal to the interpretation
        of the myth as descriptive of sunset and sunrise. Again, though the
        sun may be said to die daily, in what sense can he be said to be torn
        in pieces?<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the course of
        our inquiry it has, I trust, been made clear that there is another
        natural phenomenon to which the conception of death and resurrection
        is as applicable as to sunset and sunrise, and which, as a matter of
        fact, has been so conceived and represented in folk-custom. That
        phenomenon is the annual growth and decay of vegetation. A strong
        reason for interpreting the death of Osiris as the decay of
        vegetation rather than as the sunset is to be found in the general,
        though not unanimous, voice of antiquity, which classed together the
        worship and myths of Osiris, Adonis, Attis, Dionysus, and Demeter, as
        religions of essentially the same type.<a id="noteref_316" name=

        opinion on this subject seems too great to be rejected as a mere
        fancy. So closely did the rites of Osiris resemble those of Adonis at
        Byblus that some of the people of Byblus themselves maintained that
        it was Osiris and not Adonis whose death was mourned by them.<a id=

        view could certainly not have been held if the rituals of the two
        gods had not been so alike as to be almost indistinguishable.
        Herodotus found the similarity between the rites of Osiris and
        Dionysus so great, that he thought it impossible the latter could
        have arisen independently; they must, he supposed, have been recently
        borrowed, with slight alterations, by the Greeks from the
        Egyptians.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href=
        "#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> Again,
        Plutarch, a very keen student of comparative religion, insists upon
        the detailed resemblance of the rites of Osiris to those of
        Dionysus.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href=
        "#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        cannot reject the evidence of such intelligent and trustworthy
        witnesses on plain matters of fact which fell under their own
        cognizance. Their explanations of the worships it is indeed possible
        to reject, for the meaning of religious cults is often open to
        question; but resemblances of ritual are matters of observation.
        Therefore, those who explain Osiris as the sun are driven to the
        alternative of either dismissing as mistaken the testimony of
        antiquity to the similarity of the rites of Osiris, Adonis, Attis,
        Dionysus, and Demeter, or of interpreting all these rites as
        sun-worship. No modern scholar has fairly faced and accepted either
        side of this alternative. To accept the former would be to affirm
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128"
        id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that we know the rites of
        these deities better than the men who practised, or at least who
        witnessed them. To accept the latter would involve a wrenching,
        clipping, mangling, and distorting of myth and ritual from which even
        Macrobius shrank.<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> On the
        other hand, the view that the essence of all these rites was the
        mimic death and revival of vegetation, explains them separately and
        collectively in an easy and natural way, and harmonizes with the
        general testimony borne by the ancients to their substantial
        similarity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before we conclude
        this study of Osiris it will be worth while to consider an ancient
        view of his nature, which deserves more attention than it has
        received in modern times. We are told by Plutarch that among the
        philosophers who saw in the gods of Egypt personifications of natural
        objects and forces, there were some who interpreted Osiris as the
        moon and his enemy Typhon as the sun, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“because the moon, with her humid and generative light,
        is favourable to the propagation of animals and the growth of plants;
        while the sun with his fierce fire scorches and burns up all growing
        things, renders the greater part of the earth uninhabitable by reason
        of his blaze, and often overpowers the moon herself.”</span><a id=

        Whatever may be thought of the physical qualities here attributed to
        the moon, the arguments adduced by the ancients to prove the identity
        of Osiris with that luminary carry with them a weight which has at
        least not been lightened by the results of modern research. An
        examination of them and of other evidence pointing in the same

        each of the fourteen days that make up the second half of a lunar
        month. It is expressly said that his enemy Typhon found the body of

        the dismemberment of the god would begin with the waning of the moon.
        To primitive man it seems manifest that the waning moon is actually
        dwindling, and he naturally enough explains its diminution by
        supposing that the planet is being rent or broken in pieces or eaten
        away. The Klamath Indians of Oregon speak of the moon as <span class=

        be described by him in such forcible language. The Dacotas believe
        that when the moon is full, a great many little mice begin to nibble
        at one side of it and do not cease till they have eaten it all up,
        after which a new moon is born and grows to maturity, only to share

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> things, the early philosopher is led by
        certain obvious, though fallacious, appearances to regard the moon as
        the ultimate cause of the growth of plants. In the first place he
        associates its apparent growth and decay with the growth and decay of
        sublunary things, and imagines that in virtue of a secret sympathy
        the celestial phenomena really produce those terrestrial changes
        which in point of fact they merely resemble. Thus Pliny says that the
        moon may fairly be considered the planet of breath, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“because it saturates the earth and by its approach fills
        bodies, while by its departure it empties them. Hence it is,”</span>
        he goes on, <span class="tei tei-q">“that shell-fish increase with
        the increase of the moon and that bloodless creatures especially feel
        breath at that time; even the blood of men grows and diminishes with
        the light of the moon, and leaves and herbage also feel the same
        influence, since the lunar energy penetrates all
        things.”</span><a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no doubt,”</span> writes Macrobius,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that the moon is the author and framer of

        <span class="tei tei-q">“the same things which grow with the waxing,

        commentary of Plutarch's on Hesiod a statement that the onion is the
        only vegetable which violates this great law of nature by sprouting
        in the wane and withering in the increase of the moon.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this supposed
        influence of the moon on the life of plants and animals, men in
        ancient and modern times have deduced a whole code of rules for the

        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name=
        "Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> their affairs. Thus an
        ancient writer on agriculture lays it down as a maxim, that whatever
        is to be sown should be sown while the moon is waxing, and that
        whatever is to be cut or gathered should be cut or gathered while it
        is waning.<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href=
        "#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> A
        modern treatise on superstition describes how the superstitious man
        regulates all his conduct by the moon: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whatever he would have to grow, he sets about it when
        she is in her increase; but for what he would have made less he
        chooses her wane.”</span><a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a> In
        Germany the phases of the moon are observed by superstitious people
        at all the more or even less important actions of life, such as
        tilling the fields, building or changing houses, marriages,
        hair-cutting, bleeding, cupping, and so forth. The particular rules
        vary in different places, but the principle generally followed is
        that whatever is done to increase anything should be done while the
        moon is waxing; whatever is done to diminish anything should be done
        while the moon is waning. For example, sowing, planting, and grafting
        should be done in the first half of the moon, but the felling of
        timber and mowing should be done in the second half.<a id=

        various parts of Europe it is believed that plants, nails, hair, and
        corns, cut while the moon is on the increase, will grow again fast,
        but that if cut while it is on the decrease they will grow slowly or
        waste <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name=

        other hand they thought that garden vegetables, such as onions and
        kail, run to seed if they are sown in the increase, but that they
        grow to pot-herbs if they are sown in the wane.<a id="noteref_350"

        Thomas Tusser advised the peasant to sow peas and beans in the wane

        first appearance of the new moon with beating of drums and other

        this matter of sowing and planting a refined distinction is sometimes
        drawn by French, German, and Esthonian peasants; plants which bear
        fruit above ground are sown by them when the moon is waxing, but
        plants which are cultivated for the sake of their roots, such as
        potatoes and turnips, are sown when the moon is waning.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> The
        reason for this distinction seems to be a vague idea that the waxing
        moon is coming up and the waning moon going down, and that
        accordingly fruits which grow upwards should be sown in the former
        period, and fruits which grow downwards in the latter. Before
        beginning to plant their cacao the Pipiles of Central America exposed
        the finest seeds for four nights to the moonlight,<a id="noteref_354"
        name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a> but
        whether they did so at the waxing or waning of the moon is not said.
        Even pots, it would seem, are not exempt from this great law of
        nature. In Uganda <span class="tei tei-q">“potters waited for the new
        moon to appear before baking their pots; when it was some days old,
        they prepared their fires and baked the vessels. No potter would bake
        pots when the moon was past the full, for he believed that they would
        be a failure, and would be sure to crack or break in the burning, if
        he did so, and that his labour accordingly would go for
        nothing.”</span><a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href=

        thought fit and natural that the operation of cutting down should be
        performed on earth at the time when the lunar orb was, so to say,
        being cut down in the sky. In France before the Revolution the
        forestry laws enjoined that trees should only be felled after the
        moon had passed the full; and in French bills announcing the sale of
        timber you may still read a notice that the wood was cut in the
        waning of the moon.<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href=

        among the Shans of Burma, when a house is to be built, it is a rule
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“a lucky day should be chosen to
        commence the cutting of the bamboos. The day must not only be a
        fortunate one for the builder, but it must also be in the second half
        of the month, when the moon is waning. Shans believe that if bamboos
        are cut during the first half of the month, when the moon is waxing,
        they do not last well, as boring insects attack them and they will
        soon become rotten. This belief is prevalent all over the
        East.”</span><a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href=

        belief obtains in various parts of Mexico. No Mexican will cut timber
        while the moon is increasing; they say it must be cut while the moon
        is waning or the wood will certainly rot.<a id="noteref_359" name=

        Colombia, South America, people think that corn should only be sown
        and timber felled when the moon is on the wane. They say that the
        waxing moon draws the sap up through the trunk and branches, whereas
        the sap flows down and leaves the wood dry during the wane of the
        moon.<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> adopted, and equally forcible arguments are
        urged in its defence. Thus, when the Wabondei of Eastern Africa are
        about to build a house, they take care to cut the posts for it when
        the moon is on the increase; for they say that posts cut when the
        moon is wasting away would soon rot, whereas posts cut while the moon
        is waxing are very durable.<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361"

        cause of growth in plants. From observing rightly that dew falls most
        thickly on cloudless nights, they inferred wrongly that it was caused
        by the moon, a theory which the poet Alcman expressed in mythical

        the humid power of the moon was assumed to be greater when the planet
        was waxing than when it was waning, they thought that timber cut
        during the increase of the luminary would be saturated with moisture,
        whereas timber cut in the wane would be comparatively dry. Hence we

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus misled by a
        double fallacy primitive philosophy comes to view the moon as the
        great cause of vegetable growth, first, because the planet seems
        itself to grow, and second, because it is supposed to be the source
        of dew and moisture. It is no wonder, therefore, that agricultural
        peoples should adore the planet which they believe to influence so
        profoundly the crops on which they depend for subsistence.
        Accordingly we find that in the hotter regions of America, where
        maize is cultivated and manioc is the staple food, the moon was
        recognized as the principal object of worship, and plantations of
        manioc were assigned to it as a return for the service it rendered in
        the production of the crops. The worship of the moon in preference to
        the sun was general among the Caribs, and, perhaps, also among most
        of the other Indian tribes who cultivated maize in the tropical
        forests to the east of the Andes; and the same thing has been
        observed, under the same physical conditions, among the aborigines of
        the hottest region of Peru, the northern valleys of Yuncapata. Here
        the Indians of Pacasmayu and the neighbouring valleys revered the
        moon as their principal divinity. The <span class="tei tei-q">“house
        of the moon”</span> at Pacasmayu was the chief temple of the
        district; and the same sacrifices of maize-flour, of wine, and of
        children which were offered by the mountaineers of the Andes to the
        Sun-god, were offered by the lowlanders to the Moon-god in order that
        he might cause their crops to thrive.<a id="noteref_369" name=

        man, and various customs and rules have been deduced from it which
        aim at the amelioration and even the indefinite extension of human
        life. To illustrate this application of the popular theory at length
        would be out of place here, but a few cases may be mentioned by way

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In India people
        attempt to absorb the vital influence of the moon by drinking water
        in which the luminary is reflected. Thus the Mohammedans of Oude fill
        a silver basin with water and hold it so that the orb of the full
        moon is mirrored in it. The person to be benefited must look
        steadfastly at the moon in the basin, then shut his eyes and drink
        the water at one gulp. Doctors recommend the draught as a remedy for
        nervous disorders and palpitation of the heart. Somewhat similar
        customs prevail among the Hindoos of Northern India. At the full moon
        of the month of Kuar (September-October) people lay out food on the
        house-tops, and when it has absorbed the rays of the moon they
        distribute it among their relations, who are supposed to lengthen
        their life by eating of the food which has thus been saturated with
        moonshine. Patients are often made to look at the moon reflected in
        melted butter, oil, or milk as a cure for leprosy and the like

        Kiriwina, one of the Trobriands Group to the east of New Guinea, a

        new moon appears, the mother takes a torch or a burning brand from
        the fire and goes to the ash-heap behind the hut. She is followed by

        the Apinagos Indians, on the Tocantins River in Brazil, the French
        traveller Castelnau witnessed a remarkable dance by moonlight. The
        Indians danced in two long ranks which faced each other, the women on
        one side, the men on the other. Between the two ranks of dancers
        blazed a great fire. The men were painted in brilliant colours, and
        for the most part wore white or red skull-caps made of maize-flour
        and resin. Their dancing was very monotonous and consisted of a jerky
        movement of the body, while the dancer advanced first one leg and
        then the other. This dance they accompanied with a melancholy song,
        striking the ground with their weapons. Opposite them the women,
        naked and unpainted, stood in a single rank, their bodies bent
        slightly forward, their knees pressed together, their arms swinging
        in measured time, now forward, now backward, so as to join hands. A
        remarkable figure in the dance was a personage painted scarlet all
        over, who held in his hand a rattle composed of a gourd full of
        pebbles. From time to time he leaped across the great fire which
        burned between the men and the women. Then he would run rapidly in
        front of the women, stopping now and then before one or other and
        performing a series of strange gambols, while he shook his rattle
        violently. Sometimes he would sink with one knee to the ground, and
        then suddenly throw himself backward. Altogether the agility and
        endurance which he displayed were remarkable. This dance lasted for
        hours. When a woman was tired out she withdrew, and her place was
        taken by another; but the same men danced the monotonous dance all
        night. Towards midnight the moon attained the zenith and flooded the
        scene with her bright rays. A change <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> now took place in the dance. A long line of men
        and women advanced to the fire between the ranks of the dancers. Each
        of them held one end of a hammock in which lay a new-born infant,
        whose squalls could be heard. These babes were now to be presented by
        their parents to the moon. On reaching the end of the line each
        couple swung the hammock, accompanying the movement by a chant, which
        all the Indians sang in chorus. The song seemed to consist of three
        words, repeated over and over again. Soon a shrill voice was heard,
        and a hideous old hag, like a skeleton, appeared with her arms raised
        above her head. She went round and round the assembly several times,
        then disappeared in silence. While she was present, the scarlet
        dancer with the rattle bounded about more furiously than ever,
        stopping only for a moment while he passed in front of the line of
        women. His body was contracted and bent towards them, and described
        an undulatory movement like that of a worm writhing. He shook his
        rattle violently, as if he would fain kindle in the women the fire
        which burned in himself. Then rising abruptly he would resume his
        wild career. During this time the loud voice of an orator was heard
        from the village repeating a curious name without cessation. Then the
        speaker approached slowly, carrying on his back some gorgeous bunches
        of brilliant feathers and under his arm a stone axe. Behind him
        walked a young woman bearing an infant in a loose girdle at her
        waist; the child was wrapped in a mat, which protected it against the
        chill night air. The couple paced slowly for a minute or two, and
        then vanished without speaking a word. At the same moment the curious
        name which the orator had shouted was taken up by the whole assembly
        and repeated by them again and again. This scene in its turn lasted a
        long time, but ceased suddenly with the setting of the moon. The
        French traveller who witnessed it fell asleep, and when he awoke all
        was calm once more: there was nothing to recall the infernal dances
        of the night.<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href=

        American Indians, pay a superstitious respect to the moon. We may
        suppose that the ceremonious presentation of the infants to the moon
        was intended to ensure their life and growth. The names solemnly
        chanted by the whole assembly were probably those which the parents
        publicly bestowed on their children. As to the scarlet dancer who
        leaped across the fire, we may conjecture that he personated the
        moon, and that his strange antics in front of the women were designed
        to impart to them the fertilizing virtue of the luminary, and perhaps
        to facilitate their delivery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Baganda
        of Central Africa there is general rejoicing when the new moon
        appears, and no work is done for seven days. When the crescent is
        first visible at evening, mothers take out their babies and hold them
        at arms' length, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“I want my child to
        keep in health till the moon wanes.”</span> At the same time a
        ceremony is performed which may be intended to ensure the king's life
        and health throughout the ensuing month. It is a custom with the
        Baganda to preserve the king's navel-string with great care during
        his life. The precious object is called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Twin”</span> of the king, as if it were his double; and
        the ghost of the royal afterbirth is believed to be attached to it.
        Enclosed in a pot, which is wrapt in bark cloths, the navel-string is
        kept in a temple specially built for it near the king's enclosure,
        and a great minister of state acts as its guardian and priest. Every
        new moon, at evening, he carries it in state, wrapped in bark cloths,
        to the king, who takes it into his hands, examines it, and returns it
        to the minister. The keeper of the navel-string then goes back with
        it to the house and sets it in the doorway, where it remains all
        night. Next morning it is taken from its wrappings and again placed
        in the doorway until the evening, when it is once more swathed in
        bark cloths and restored to its usual place.<a id="noteref_396" name=

        Apparently the navel-string is conceived as a vital portion, a sort
        of external soul, of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg

        saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“If it is thine, take it to thee. But

        would be easy to understand why the waning moon should be deemed
        injurious to children; they might be supposed to peak and pine with
        its dwindling light. Thus in Angus it is thought that if a child be

        wanes.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href=
        "#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a>
        Accordingly, they say in Germany that if you would rid yourself of
        warts you should treat them when the moon is on the decrease.<a id=
        "noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> And a
        German cure for toothache, earache, headache, and so forth, is to
        look towards the waning moon and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“As the
        moon decreases, so may my pains decrease also.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a>
        However, some Germans reverse the rule. They say, for example, that
        if you are afflicted with a wen, you should face the waxing moon, lay
        your finger on the wen, and say thrice, <span class="tei tei-q">“What
        I see waxes; what I touch, let it vanish away.”</span> After each of
        these two sentences you should cross yourself thrice. Then go home
        without speaking to any one, and repeat three paternosters behind the
        kitchen door.<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href=
        "#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a> The
        Huzuls of the Carpathians recommend a somewhat similar, and no doubt
        equally efficacious, cure for waterbrash. They say that at new moon
        the patient should run thrice round the house and then say to the
        moon, <span class="tei tei-q">“Moon, moon, where wast thou?”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Behind the mountain.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What hast thou eaten there?”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Horse flesh.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Why hast
        thou brought me nothing?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Because I
        forgot.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“May the waterbrash

        curative virtue appears to be attributed by some people to the waning
        and by others to the waxing moon. There is perhaps just as much, or
        as little, to be said for the one attribution as for the other.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A great festival
        called the Sed was celebrated by the Egyptians with much solemnity at
        intervals of thirty years. Various portions of the ritual are
        represented on the ancient monuments of Hieraconpolis and Abydos and
        in the oldest decorated temple of Egypt known to us, that of Usirniri
        at Busiris, which dates from the fifth dynasty. It appears that the
        ceremonies were as old as the Egyptian civilization, and that they
        continued to be observed till the end of the Roman period.<a id=

        reason for holding them at intervals of thirty <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> years is uncertain, but we can hardly
        doubt that the period was determined by astronomical considerations.
        According to one view, it was based on the observation of Saturn's
        period of revolution round the sun, which is, roughly speaking,
        thirty years, or, more exactly, twenty-nine years and one hundred and
        seventy-four days.<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href=
        "#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a>
        According to another view, the thirty years' period had reference to
        Sirius, the star of Isis. We have seen that on account of the vague
        character of the old Egyptian year the heliacal rising of Sirius
        shifted its place gradually through every month of the
        calendar.<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href=
        "#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a> In one
        hundred and twenty years the star thus passed through one whole month
        of thirty days. To speak more precisely, it rose on the first of the
        month during the first four years of the period: it rose on the
        second of the month in the second four years, on the third of the
        month in the third four years; and so on successively, till in the
        last four years of the hundred and twenty years it rose on the last
        day of the month. As the Egyptians watched the annual summer rising
        of the star with attention and associated it with the most popular of
        their goddesses, it would be natural that its passage from one month
        to another, at intervals of one hundred and twenty years, should be
        the occasion of a great festival, and that the long period of one
        hundred and twenty years should be divided into four minor periods of
        thirty years respectively, each celebrated by a minor festival.<a id=
        "noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> If this
        theory of the Sed festivals is correct, we should expect to find that
        every fourth celebration was distinguished from the rest by a higher
        degree of solemnity, since it marked the completion of a twelfth part
        of the star's journey through the twelve <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> months. Now it appears that in point of fact
        every fourth Sed festival was marked off from its fellows by the
        adjective <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tep</span></span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“chief,”</span> and that these <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“chief”</span> celebrations fell as a rule in the years
        when Sirius rose on the first of the month.<a id="noteref_414" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> These
        facts confirm the view that the Sed festival was closely connected
        with the star Sirius, and through it with Isis.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, we are
        here concerned rather with the meaning and the rites of the festival
        than with the reasons for holding it once every thirty years. The
        intention of the festival seems to have been to procure for the king
        a new lease of life, a renovation of his divine energies, a
        rejuvenescence. In the inscriptions of Abydos we read, after an
        account of the rites, the following address to the king: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou dost recommence thy renewal, thou art granted to
        flourish again like the infant god Moon, thou dost grow young again,
        and that from season to season, like Nun at the beginning of time,
        thou art born again in renewing the Sed festivals. All life comes to
        thy nostril, and thou art king of the whole earth for
        ever.”</span><a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href=

        short, on these occasions it appears to have been supposed that the
        king was in a manner born again.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But how was the
        new birth effected? Apparently the essence of the rites consisted in
        identifying the king with Osiris; for just as Osiris had died and
        risen again from the dead, so the king might be thought to die and to
        live again with the god whom he personated. The ceremony would thus
        be for the king a death as well as a rebirth. Accordingly in pictures
        of the Sed festival on the monuments we see the king posing as the
        dead Osiris. He sits in a shrine like a god, holding in his hands the
        crook and flail of Osiris: he is wrapped in tight bandages like the
        mummified Osiris; indeed, there is nothing but his name to prove that
        he is not Osiris himself. This enthronement of the king in the
        attitude of the dead god seems to have been the principal event of
        the festival.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href=

        Further, the queen and the king's daughters figured prominently in

        some sculptures at Carnac the queen is portrayed shooting arrows

        is believed to date from 5500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Here we see the king
        seated as Osiris in a shrine at the top of nine steps. Beside the
        shrine stand fan-bearers, and in front of it is a figure in a
        palanquin, which, according to an inscription in another
        representation of the scene, appears to be the royal child. An
        enclosure of curtains hung on poles surrounds the dancing-ground,
        where three men are performing a sacred dance. A procession of
        standards is depicted beside the enclosure; it is headed by the
        standard of the jackal-god Up-uat, the <span class=

        Similarly on a seal of King Zer, or rather Khent, one of the early
        kings of the first dynasty, the monarch appears as Osiris with the
        standard of the jackal-god before him. In front of him, too, is the
        ostrich feather on which <span class="tei tei-q">“the dead king was
        supposed to ascend into heaven. Here, then, the king, identified with
        Osiris, king of the dead, has before him the jackal-god, who leads

        are even grounds for thinking that in order to complete the mimic

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
        Professor Flinders Petrie, <span class="tei tei-q">“the conclusion
        may be drawn thus. In the savage age of prehistoric times, the
        Egyptians, like many other African and Indian peoples, killed their
        priest-king at stated intervals, in order that the ruler should, with
        unimpaired life and health, be enabled to maintain the kingdom in its
        highest condition. The royal daughters were present in order that
        they might be married to his successor. The jackal-god went before
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155"
        id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> him, to open the way to the
        unseen world; and the ostrich feather received and bore away the
        king's soul in the breeze that blew it out of sight. This was the
        celebration of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘end,’</span> the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sed</span></span> feast. The king thus became
        the dead king, patron of all those who had died in his reign, who
        were his subjects here and hereafter. He was thus one with Osiris,
        the king of the dead. This fierce custom became changed, as in other
        lands, by appointing a deputy king to die in his stead; which idea
        survived in the Coptic Abu Nerūs, with his tall crown of Upper Egypt,
        false beard, and sceptre. After the death of the deputy, the real
        king renewed his life and reign. Henceforward this became the
        greatest of the royal festivals, the apotheosis of the king during
        his life, after which he became Osiris upon earth and the patron of
        the dead in the underworld.”</span><a id="noteref_423" name=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar theory
        of the Sed festival is maintained by another eminent Egyptologist, M.
        Alexandre Moret. He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“In most of the
        temples of Egypt, of all periods, pictures set forth for us the
        principal scenes of a solemn festival called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘festival of the tail,’</span> the Sed festival. It
        consisted essentially in a representation of the ritual death of the
        king followed by his rebirth. In this case the king is identified
        with Osiris, the god who in historical times is the hero of the
        sacred drama of humanity, he who guides us through the three stages
        of life, death, and rebirth in the other world. Hence, clad in the
        funeral costume of Osiris, with the tight-fitting garment clinging to
        him like a shroud, Pharaoh is conducted to the tomb; and from it he
        returns rejuvenated and reborn like Osiris emerging from the dead.
        How was this fiction carried out? how was this miracle performed? By
        the sacrifice of human or animal victims. On behalf of the king a
        priest lay down in the skin of the animal victim: he assumed the
        posture characteristic of an embryo in its mother's womb: when he
        came forth from the skin he was deemed to be reborn; and Pharaoh, for
        whom this rite was celebrated, was himself reborn, or to adopt the
        Egyptian expression, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg
        156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘he renewed his births.’</span> And in
        testimony of the due performance of the rites the king girt his loins
        with the tail, a compendious representative of the skin of the
        sacrificed beast, whence the name of <span class="tei tei-q">‘the
        festival of the tail.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How are we to explain the rule that at a certain point
        of his reign every Pharaoh must undergo this ritual death followed by
        fictitious rebirth? Is it simply a renewal of the initiation into the
        Osirian mysteries? or does the festival present some more special
        features? The ill-defined part played by the royal children in these
        rites seems to me to indicate that the Sed festival represents other
        episodes which refer to the transmission of the regal office. At the
        dawn of civilization in Egypt the people were perhaps familiar with
        the alternative either of putting their king to death in his full
        vigour in order that his power should be transmitted intact to his
        successor, or of attempting to rejuvenate him and to <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘renew his life.’</span> The latter measure was an
        invention of the Pharaohs. How could it be carried out more
        effectively than by identifying themselves with Osiris, by applying
        to themselves the process of resurrection, the funeral rites by which
        Isis, according to the priests, had magically saved her husband from
        death? Perhaps the fictitious death of the king may be regarded as a
        mitigation of the primitive murder of the divine king, a transition
        from a barbarous reality to symbolism.”</span><a id="noteref_424"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus far we have
        discussed the character of Osiris as he is presented to us in the art
        and literature of Egypt and in the testimonies of Greek writers; and
        we have found that judged by these indications he was in the main a
        god of vegetation and of the dead. But we have still to ask, how did
        the conception of such a composite deity originate? Did it arise
        simply through observation of the great annual fluctuations of the
        seasons and a desire to explain them? Was it a result of brooding
        over the mystery of external nature? Was it the attempt of a rude
        philosophy to lift the veil and explore the hidden springs that set
        the vast machine in motion? That man at a very early stage of his
        long history meditated on these things and evolved certain crude
        theories which partially satisfied his craving after knowledge is
        certain; from such meditations of Babylonian and Phrygian sages
        appear to have sprung the pathetic figures of Adonis and Attis; and
        from such meditations of Egyptian sages may have sprung the tragic
        figure of Osiris.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet a broad
        distinction seems to sever the myth and worship of Osiris from the
        kindred myths and worships of Adonis and Attis. For while Adonis and
        Attis were minor divinities in the religion of Western Asia,
        completely overshadowed by the greater deities of their respective
        pantheons, the solemn figure of Osiris towered in solitary grandeur
        over all the welter of Egyptian gods, like a pyramid of his native
        land lit up by the last rays of the setting sun when all below it is
        in shadow. And whereas legend generally represented Adonis and Attis
        as simple swains, mere herdsmen <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> or hunters whom the fatal love of a goddess had
        elevated above their homely sphere into a brief and melancholy
        pre-eminence, Osiris uniformly appears in tradition as a great and
        beneficent king. In life, he ruled over his people, beloved and
        revered for the benefits he conferred on them and on the world; in
        death he reigned in their hearts and memories as lord of the dead,
        the awful judge at whose bar every man must one day stand to give an
        account of the deeds done in the body and to receive the final award.
        In the faith of the Egyptians the cruel death and blessed
        resurrection of Osiris occupied the same place as the death and
        resurrection of Christ hold in the faith of Christians. As Osiris
        died and rose again from the dead, so they hoped through him and in
        his dear name to wake triumphant from the sleep of death to a
        blissful eternity. That was their sheet-anchor in life's stormy sea;
        that was the hope which supported and consoled millions of Egyptian
        men and women for a period of time far longer than that during which
        Christianity has now existed on earth. In the long history of
        religion no two divine figures resemble each other more closely in
        the fervour of personal devotion which they have kindled and in the
        high hopes which they have inspired than Osiris and Christ. The sad
        figure of Buddha indeed has been as deeply loved and revered by
        countless millions; but he had no glad tidings of immortality for
        men, nothing but the promise of a final release from the burden of
        mortality.</p>

        Christ have been the centres of the like enthusiastic devotion, may
        not the secret of their influence have been similar? If Christ lived
        the life and died the death of a man on earth, may not Osiris have
        done so likewise? The immense and enduring popularity of his worship
        speaks in favour of the supposition; for all the other great
        religious or semi-religious systems which have won for themselves a
        permanent place in the affections of mankind, have been founded by
        individual great men, who by their personal life and example exerted
        a power of attraction such as no cold abstractions, no pale products
        of the collective wisdom or folly could ever exert on the minds and
        hearts of humanity. Thus it was with Buddhism, with <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Confucianism, with Christianity, and with
        Mohammedanism; and thus it may well have been with the religion of
        Osiris. Certainly we shall do less violence to the evidence if we
        accept the unanimous tradition of ancient Egypt on this point than if
        we resolve the figure of Osiris into a myth pure and simple. And when
        we consider that from the earliest to the latest times Egyptian kings
        were worshipped as gods both in life and in death, there appears to
        be nothing extravagant or improbable in the view that one of them by
        his personal qualities excited a larger measure of devotion than
        usual during his life and was remembered with fonder affection and
        deeper reverence after his death; till in time his beloved memory,
        dimmed, transfigured, and encircled with a halo of glory by the mists
        of time, grew into the dominant religion of his people. At least this
        theory is reasonable enough to deserve a serious consideration. If we
        accept it, we may suppose that the mythical elements, which legend
        undoubtedly ascribed to Osiris, were later accretions which gathered
        about his memory like ivy about a ruin. There is no improbability in
        such a supposition; on the contrary, all analogy is in its favour,
        for nothing is more certain than that myths grow like weeds round the
        great historical figures of the past.</p>

        without venturing to pronounce a decided opinion on so obscure and
        difficult a question, I think it worth while, following the example
        of Dr. Wallis Budge, to indicate certain modern African analogies
        which tend to confirm the view that beneath the mythical wrappings of
        Osiris there lay the mummy of a dead man. At all events the analogies
        which I shall cite suffice to prove that the custom of worshipping
        dead kings has not been confined to Egypt, but has been apparently
        widespread throughout Africa, though the evidence now at our disposal
        only enables us to detect the observance of the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> custom at a few points of the great
        continent. But even if the resemblance in this respect between
        ancient Egypt and modern Africa should be regarded as established, it
        would not justify us in inferring an ethnical affinity between the
        fair or ruddy Egyptians and the black aboriginal races who occupy
        almost the whole of Africa except a comparatively narrow fringe on
        the northern sea-board. Scholars are still divided on the question of
        the original home and racial relationship of the ancient Egyptians.
        It has been held on the one hand that they belong to an indigenous
        white race which has been always in possession of the Mediterranean
        coasts of Africa; and on the other hand it has been supposed that
        they are akin to the Semites in blood as well as in language, and
        that they entered Africa from the East, whether by gradual
        infiltration or on a sudden wave of conquest like the Arabs in the
        decline of the Roman empire.<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426"

        either view a great gulf divided them from the swarthy natives of the
        Sudan, with whom they were always in contact on their southern
        border; and though a certain admixture may have taken place through
        marriage between the two races, it seems unsafe to assume that the
        religious and political resemblances which can be traced between them
        are based on any closer relationship than the general similarity in
        structure and functions of the human mind.</p>

        interred at the village where he was born and where his afterbirth is
        buried, these grave-shrines are scattered over the country. Each of
        them usually comprises a small group of round huts, resembling the
        common houses of the people, the whole being enclosed by a fence; one
        of the huts is built over the grave, the others are occupied by the
        guardians of the shrine, who at first are generally the widows or old
        men-servants of the deceased king. When these women or retainers die,
        they are succeeded in office by their descendants, for the tombs are
        maintained in perpetuity, so that the number of temples and of gods
        is always on the increase. Cattle are dedicated to these royal
        shrines and animals sacrificed at them. For example, when the millet
        crop threatens to fail or a murrain breaks out among the beasts, one
        of the dead kings will appear to somebody in a dream and demand a
        sacrifice. The dream is reported to the king, and he immediately
        orders a bullock and a cow to be sent to the grave of the dead king
        who appeared in a vision of the night to the sleeper. This is done;
        the bullock is killed and the cow added to the sacred herd of the
        shrine. It is customary, also, though not necessary, at harvest to
        offer some of the new millet at the temple-tombs of the kings; and
        sick people send animals to be sacrificed there on their behalf.
        Special regard is paid to trees that grow near the graves of the
        kings; and the spirits of the departed monarchs are believed to
        appear from time to time in the form of certain animals. One of them,
        for example, always takes the shape of a certain insect, which seems
        to be the larva of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mantidae</span></span>. When a Shilluk finds one
        of these insects, he will take it up in his hands and deposit it
        reverentially at the shrine. Other kings manifest themselves as a
        certain species of white birds; others assume the form of giraffes.
        When one of these long-legged and long-necked creatures comes
        stalking up fearlessly to a village where there is a king's grave,
        the people know that the king's soul is in the animal, and the
        attendants at the royal tomb testify their joy at the appearance of
        their master by sacrificing a sheep or even a bullock.</p>

        ancestor of all the kings who have reigned after him to the present
        day. Of these kings the Shilluks have preserved the memory and the

        but the period of time covered by their reigns is much shorter than
        it would have been under conditions such as now prevail in Europe;

        while tradition appears to be unanimous as to the custom of regicide,
        it varies as to the precise mode in which the kings were relieved of
        their office and of life. But still the people are convinced that
        Nyakang did not really die but only vanished mysteriously away like
        the wind. When a missionary asked the Shilluks as to the manner of
        Nyakang's death, they were filled with amazement at his ignorance and
        stoutly maintained that he never died, for were he to die all the
        Shilluks would die also.<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There seems to be
        no doubt that in spite of the mythical elements which have gathered
        round his memory, Nyakang was a real man, who led the Shilluks to
        their present home on the Nile either from the west or from the
        south; for on this point tradition varies. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The first and most important ancestor, who is everywhere

        from the other great men on earth. Nyakang, as we know, was an
        historical personage; he led the Shilluks to the land which they now
        occupy; he helped them to victory, made them great and warlike,
        regulated marriage and law, distributed the country among them,
        divided it into districts, and in order to increase the dependence of
        the people on him and to show them his power, became their greatest
        benefactor by giving himself out as the bestower of
        rain.”</span><a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href=

        Nyakang is now universally revered by the people as a demi-god;
        indeed for all practical purposes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> his worship quite eclipses that of the supreme
        god Juok, the creator, who, having ordered the world, committed it to
        the care of ancestral spirits and demons, and now, dwelling aloft,
        concerns himself no further with human affairs. Hence men pay little
        heed to their creator and seldom take his name into their lips except
        in a few conventional forms of salutation at meeting and parting like
        our <span class="tei tei-q">“Good-bye.”</span> Far otherwise is it
        with Nyakang. He <span class="tei tei-q">“is the ancestor of the
        Shilluk nation and the founder of the Shilluk dynasty. He is
        worshipped, sacrifices and prayers are offered to him; he may be said
        to be lifted to the rank of a demi-god, though they never forget that
        he has been a real man. He is expressly designated as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘little’</span> in comparison with God.”</span> Yet
        <span class="tei tei-q">“in the political, religious and personal
        life Nyakang takes a far more important place than Juok. Nyakang is
        the national hero, of whom each Shilluk feels proud, who is praised
        in innumerable popular songs and sayings; he is not only a superior
        being, but also a man. He is the sublime model for every true
        Shilluk; everything they value most in their national and private
        life has its origin in him: their kingdom and their fighting as well
        as cattle-breeding and farming. While Nyakang is their good father,
        who only does them good, Juok is the great, uncontrollable power,
        which is to be propitiated, in order to avoid his inflictions of
        evil.”</span><a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole working religion of the Shilluk is
        a cult of Nyakang, the semi-divine ancestor of their kings, in each

        transmission of the divine or semi-divine spirit of Nyakang to the
        reigning monarch appears to take place at the king's installation and
        to be effected by means of a rude wooden effigy of Nyakang, in which
        the spirit of that deified man is perhaps supposed to be immanent.
        But however the spiritual transmission may be carried out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the fundamental idea of the cult of the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The universal
        belief of the Shilluks in the former humanity of Nyakang is strongly
        confirmed by the exact parallelism which prevails between his worship
        and that of the dead kings his successors. Like them he is worshipped
        at his tomb; but unlike them he has not one tomb only, but ten
        scattered over the country. Each of these tombs is called
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the grave of Nyakang,”</span> though the
        people well know that nobody is buried there. Like the grave-shrines
        of the other kings, those of Nyakang consist of a small group of
        circular huts of the ordinary pattern enclosed by a fence. Only
        children under puberty and the few old people whose duty it is to
        take care of the shrines may enter these sacred enclosures. The rites
        performed at them resemble those observed at the shrines of the
        kings. Two great ceremonies are annually performed at the shrines of
        Nyakang: one is observed before the beginning of the rainy season in
        order to ensure a due supply of rain; the other is a thanksgiving at
        harvest, when porridge made from the new grain is poured out on the
        threshold of Nyakang's hut and smeared on the outer walls of the
        building. Even before the millet is reaped the people cut some of the
        ripening ears and thrust them into the thatch of the sacred hut. Thus
        it would seem that the Shilluks believe themselves to be dependent on
        the favour of Nyakang for the rain and the crops. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As the giver of rain, Nyakang is the first and greatest
        benefactor of the people. In that country rain is everything, without
        rain there is nothing. The Shilluk does not trouble his head about
        artificial irrigation, he waits for the rain. If the rain falls, then
        the millet grows, the cows thrive, man has food and can dance and
        marry; for that is the ideal of the Shilluks.”</span><a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The example of
        Nyakang seems to show that under favourable circumstances the worship
        of a dead king may develop into the dominant religion of a people.
        There is, therefore, no intrinsic improbability in the view that in
        ancient Egypt the religion of Osiris originated in that way.
        Certainly some curious resemblances can be traced between the dead
        Nyakang and the dead Osiris. Both died violent and mysterious deaths:
        the graves of both were pointed out in many parts of the country:
        both were deemed the great sources of fertility for the whole land:
        and both were associated with certain sacred trees and animals,
        particularly with bulls. And just as Egyptian kings identified
        themselves both in life and in death with their deified predecessor
        Osiris, so Shilluk kings are still believed to be animated by the
        spirit of their deified predecessor Nyakang and to share his
        divinity.</p>

        people who regularly worship, or rather used to worship, the spirits
        of their dead kings are the Baganda. Their country Uganda lies at the
        very source of the Nile, where the great river issues from Lake
        Victoria Nyanza. Among them the ghosts of dead kings were placed on
        an equality with the gods and received the same honour and worship;
        they foretold events which concerned the State, and they advised the
        living king, warning him when war was likely to break out. The king
        consulted them periodically, visiting first one and then another of
        the temples in which the mortal remains of his predecessors were
        preserved with religious care. But the temple (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">malolo</span></span>) of a king contained only
        his lower jawbone and his navel-string (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mulongo</span></span>); his body was buried
        elsewhere.<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href=
        "#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> For
        curiously enough the Baganda believed that the part of the body to
        which the ghost of a dead man adheres above all others is the lower
        jawbone; wherever that portion of his person may be carried, the
        ghost, in the opinion of these people, will follow it, even to the
        ends of the earth, and will be perfectly content to remain with it so
        long as the jawbone is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg

        the jawbones of all the kings of Uganda from the earliest times to
        the present day have been preserved with the utmost care, each of
        them being deposited, along with the stump of the monarch's
        navel-string, in a temple specially dedicated to the worship of the
        king's ghost; for it is believed that the ghosts of the deceased
        monarchs would quarrel if they shared the same temple, the question
        of precedence being one which it would be very difficult for them to
        adjust to their mutual satisfaction.<a id="noteref_442" name=

        means the place of the graves, because the tombs as well as the
        temples of the departed potentates are situated within its
        boundaries. The supervision of the temples and of the estates
        attached to them was a duty incumbent on the <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a king dies,
        his body is sent to Busiro and there embalmed. Then it is laid to
        rest in a large round house, which has been built for its reception
        on the top of a hill. This is the king's tomb. It is a conical
        structure supported by a central post, with a thatched roof reaching
        down to the ground. Round the hut a high strong fence of reeds is
        erected, and an outer fence encircles the whole at some distance
        lower down the hill. Here the body is placed on a bedstead; the
        sepulchral chamber is filled with bark cloths till it can hold no
        more, the mainpost is cut down, and the door of the tomb closed, so
        that no one can enter it again. When that was done, the wives of the
        late king used to be brought, with their arms pinioned, and placed at
        intervals round the outer wall of the tomb, where they were clubbed
        to death. Hundreds of men were also killed in the space between the
        two fences, that their ghosts might wait on the ghost of the dead
        king in the other world. None of their bodies were buried; they were
        left to rot where they fell. Then the gates in the fences were
        closed; and three chiefs <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg

        with their men guarded the dead bodies from the wild beasts and the

        the jawbone of the royal corpse was removed in order to be fashioned
        into an effigy or representative of the dead king. For this purpose
        three chiefs entered the tomb, not through the door, but by cutting a
        hole through the wall, and having severed the head from the body they
        brought it out, carefully filling up the hole in the wall behind
        them, replacing the thatch, and securing the gates in the fence. When
        the jawbone had been removed by a chief of the Civet clan, the skull
        was sent back to Busiro and buried with honour near the mouldering
        tomb. In contrast to the neglect of the tomb where the royal body
        lay, the place where the skull was buried was kept in good repair and
        guarded by some of the old princesses and widows. As for the jawbone,
        it was put in an ant-hill and left there till the ants had eaten away
        all the flesh. Then, after it had been washed in beer and milk, it
        was decorated with cowry-shells and placed in a wooden vessel; this
        vessel was next wrapt in bark cloths till it assumed a conical shape,
        about two and a half feet high by a foot and a half broad at the
        base. This conical packet, decorated on the outside with beads, was
        treated as an image of the deceased king or rather as if it were the
        king himself in life, for it was called simply <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The King.”</span> Beside it was placed the stump of the

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> The
        reason for preserving both the jawbone and the navel-string was that
        the ghost of the king was supposed to attach itself to his jawbone,
        and the ghost of his double to his navel-string. For in the belief of
        the Baganda every person has a double, namely, the afterbirth or
        placenta, which is born immediately after him and is regarded by the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170"
        id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> people as a second child. Now
        that double has a ghost of its own, which adheres to the
        navel-string; and if the person is to remain healthy, it is essential
        that the ghost of his double should be carefully preserved. Hence
        every Baganda man and woman keeps his or her navel-string wrapt up in
        bark cloth as a treasure of great price on which his health and
        prosperity are dependent; the precious little bundle is called his
        Twin (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mulongo</span></span>), because it contains the
        ghost of his double, the afterbirth. If that is deemed necessary for
        everybody, much more is it deemed essential for the welfare of the
        king; hence during his life the stump of his navel-string is kept, as
        we saw,<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href=

        of the principal ministers of state and is inspected by the king
        himself every month. And when his majesty has departed this life, the
        unity of his spirit imperatively demands that his own ghost and the
        ghost of his double should be kept together in the same place; that
        is why the jawbone and the navel-string of every dead king are
        carefully preserved in the same temple, because the two ghosts adhere
        respectively to these two parts of his person, and it would be
        unreasonable and indeed cruel to divide them.<a id="noteref_447"

        having been thus safely lodged in the two precious parcels, the next
        thing was to install them in the temple, where they were to enter on
        their career of beneficent activity. A site having been chosen, the
        whole country supplied the labour necessary for building the temple;
        and ministers were appointed to wait upon the dead king. The officers
        of state who had held important posts during his life retained their
        titles and continued to discharge their duties towards their old
        master in death. Accordingly houses were built for them near the
        temple. The dowager queen also took up her residence at the entrance
        to the temple enclosure, and became its principal guardian. Many also
        of the king's widows of lower rank were drafted off to live inside
        the enclosure and keep watch over it. When the queen or any of these
        widows died, her place was supplied by another princess or a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171"
        id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> woman of the same clan; for
        the temple was maintained in perpetuity. However, when the reigning
        king died, the temple of his predecessor lost much of its importance,
        though it was still kept up in a less magnificent style; indeed no
        temple of a dead king was allowed to disappear altogether.<a id=

        from time to time to be inspired by the ghost of the deceased monarch

        himself by drinking a draught of beer and a draught of milk out of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temple
        consecrated to the worship of a king regularly stood on a hill. The
        site was generally chosen by the king in his life, but sometimes his
        choice was set aside by his successor, who gave orders to build the
        temple in another place.<a id="noteref_450" name="noteref_450" href=
        "#note_450"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        structure was a large conical or bee-hive-shaped hut of the ordinary
        pattern, divided internally into two chambers, an outer and an inner.
        Any person might enter the outer chamber, but the inner was sacred
        and no profane person might set foot in it; for there the holy relics
        of the dead king, his jawbone and his navel-string, were kept for
        safety in a cell dug in the floor, and there, in close attendance on
        them, the king's ghost was believed to dwell. In front of the
        partition which screened this Holy of Holies from the gaze of the
        multitude there stood a throne, covered with lion and leopard skins
        and fenced off from the rest of the sacred edifice by a glittering
        rail of brass spears, shields, and knives. A forest of poles,
        supporting the roof, formed a series of aisles in perfect line, and
        at the end of the central nave appeared, like the altar of a
        Christian church, the throne in all its glory. When the king's ghost
        held a reception, the holy relics, the jawbone and the navel-string,
        each in its decorated wrappings, were brought forth and set on the
        throne; and every person who entered the temple bowed to the ground
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172"
        id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and greeted the jawbone in an
        awestruck voice, for he regarded it as the king in person. Solemn
        music played during the reception, the drums rolling and the women
        chanting, while they clapped their hands to the rhythm of the songs.
        Sometimes the dead king spoke to the congregation by the voice of his
        prophet. That was a great event. When the oracle was about to be
        given to the expectant throng, the prophet stepped up to the throne,
        and addressing the spirit informed him of the business in hand. Then
        he smoked one or two pipes, and the fumes bringing on the prophetic
        fit, he began to rave and to speak in the very voice and with the
        characteristic turns of speech of the departed monarch, for the
        king's spirit was now in him. This message from the world beyond the
        grave was naturally received with rapt attention. Gradually the fit
        of inspiration passed: the voice of the prophet resumed its natural
        tones: the spirit had departed from him and returned to its abode in
        the inner room. Such a solemn audience used to be announced
        beforehand by the beating of the drums in the early morning, and the
        worshippers brought with them to the temple offerings of food for the
        dead king, as if he were still alive.<a id="noteref_451" name=

        day of all was when the reigning king visited the temple of his

        people approve of the visits being repeated, for each visit was the
        signal for the death of many. Yet, attracted by a painful curiosity,
        crowds assembled, followed the monarch to the temple, and thronged to
        see the great ceremony of the meeting between the king and the ghost
        of his royal father. The sacred relics were displayed: an old man
        explained them to the monarch and placed them in his hands: the
        prophet, inspired by the dead king's spirit, revealed to the living
        king his destiny. The interview over, the king was carried back to

        though the king rarely visited his father's ghost at the temple, he
        had a private chapel for the ghost within the vast enclosure of the
        royal residence; and here he often paid his devotions to the august
        spirit, of whom he stood greatly in awe. He took his wives with him
        to sing the departed monarch's praise, and he constantly made
        offerings at the shrine. Thither, too, would come the prophet to suck
        words of wisdom from the venerable ghost and to impart them to the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Kiziba, a
        district of Central Africa on the western side of Lake Victoria
        Nyanza, the souls of dead kings become ruling spirits; temples are
        built in their honour and priests appointed to serve them. The people
        are composed of two different races, the Bairu, who are aboriginals,
        and the Bahima, who are immigrants from the north. The royal family
        belongs to the Bahima stock. In his lifetime the king's person is
        sacred; and all his actions, property, and so forth are described by
        special terms appropriated to that purpose. The people are divided
        into totemic clans: the totems (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">muziro</span></span>) are mostly animals or
        parts of animals: no man may kill or eat his totem animal, nor marry
        a woman who has the same totem as himself. The royal family seems to
        have serpents for their totem; after death the king's soul lives in a
        serpent, while his body is buried in the hut where he died. The
        people revere a supreme god named Rugaba, who is believed to have
        created man and cattle; but they know little about him, and though
        they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name=

        him, particularly in the case of a difficult birth, he has no priests
        and receives no sacrifices. The business of the priests is to act as
        intermediaries, not between God and man, but between men and the
        spirits. The spirits are believed to have been formerly kings of the
        world. The highest of them is a certain Wamara, who rules over the
        souls of the dead, and who would seem to have been a great king in
        his life. Temples are built for him; they are like the houses of men,
        but only half as large. A perpetual holy fire is kept up in each
        temple, and the priest passes the night in it. He receives white
        sheep or goats as victims, and generally acts also as a diviner or
        physician. When a man is very ill, he thinks that Wamara, the lord of
        the spirits of the dead, is summoning him to the far country; so he
        sends a sacrifice to Wamara's priest, who prays to the spirit to let
        the sick man live yet a while.<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454"

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Bantu tribes
        who inhabit the great tableland of Northern Rhodesia revere a supreme
        being whom they call Leza, but their ideas about him are hazy.
        Thunder, lightning, earthquakes, rain, and other natural phenomena
        are grouped together under his name as manifestations of his power.
        Among the more progressive tribes, such as the Awemba and the Wabisa,
        the great god is thought to take some interest in human affairs; and
        though they do not pray to him, they nevertheless invoke him by his
        names of praise, which set forth his attributes as the protector and
        judge of mankind. It is he, too, who receives the souls of the
        departed. <span class="tei tei-q">“Yet, as far as the dominant Wemba
        tribe is concerned, the cult of Leza is outside their ordinary
        religion. There is no direct access to him by prayer or by
        sacrifices, which are made to Mulenga and the other great
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175"
        id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> tribal and ancestral spirits
        instead. For upon such animism is founded the whole fabric of Wemba
        religion.”</span><a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href=

        ancestral spirits whom the Awemba and all other tribes of this region
        worship may be divided into two main classes. First come the spirits
        of departed chiefs, who are publicly worshipped by the whole tribe;
        and second come the spirits of near relations who are worshipped
        privately by each head of a family.<a id="noteref_456" name=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Among the Awemba there is no special shrine
        for these purely family spirits, who are worshipped inside the hut,
        and to whom family sacrifice of a sheep, a goat, or a fowl is made,
        the spirit receiving the blood spilt on the ground, while all the
        members of the family partake of the flesh together. For a religious
        Wemba man the cult of the spirit of his nearest relations (of his
        grandparents, or of his deceased father, mother, elder brother, or
        maternal uncle) is considered quite sufficient. Out of these spirit
        relatives a man will worship one whom he considers as his special
        familiar, for various reasons. For instance, the diviner may have
        told him that his last illness was caused because he had not
        respected the spirit of his uncle; accordingly he will be careful in
        future to adopt his uncle as his tutelary spirit. As a mark of such
        respect he may devote a cow or a goat to one of the spirits of his
        ancestors. Holding the fowl, for instance, in his hands, he will
        dedicate it, asking the spirit to come and abide in it, upon which
        the fowl is let go, and is afterwards called by the name of the
        spirit. If the necessities, however, of the larder demand that it
        should be killed, another animal is taken, and the spirit is asked to
        accept it as a substitute! Before beginning any special task, such as
        hoeing a new garden, or going on a journey, Wemba men invoke their
        tutelary spirits to be with them and to assist their efforts, in
        short ejaculatory prayers usually couched in a set formula. Among
        many of the tribes in the North Luangwa district longer formal
        prayers are still made to all the deceased ancestors of the clan at
        the time of harvest, asking them to protect the crops and to drive
        away illnesses and evil spirits from <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        of beer and offerings of the first-fruits.”</span><a id="noteref_457"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus among these
        tribes, who all belong to the great Bantu family, the public worship
        which a whole tribe pays to the souls of its dead chiefs is probably
        nothing but an extension of the private worship which every family
        pays privately to the souls of its dead members. And just as the
        members of his family whom a man worships privately are not mythical
        beings conjured up by imagination out of a distant past, but were
        once real men like himself whom he knew in life, it may be his
        father, or uncle, or elder brother, so we may be sure that in like
        manner the dead chiefs revered by the whole tribe are not creations
        of the mythical fancy, but were once real men of flesh and blood, who
        ruled over the tribe, and whose memory has been more or less
        faithfully preserved by tradition. In this respect the tribes of
        Northern Rhodesia are typical of all the tribes of that great Bantu
        family which occupies nearly the whole southern half of Africa, from
        the great equatorial lakes to the Cape of Good Hope. The main
        practical religion of all these numerous and widespread peoples
        appears to be the worship of their ancestors.</p>

        of the Bantu stock. Speaking with special reference to the tribes of
        South-Eastern Africa, the Rev. James Macdonald tells us that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the religion of the Bantu, which they not
        only profess but really regulate their conduct by, is based on the
        belief that the spirits of their ancestors interfere constantly in
        their affairs. Every man worships his own ancestors and offers
        sacrifices to avert their wrath. The clan worships the spirits of the
        ancestors of its chiefs, and the tribe worships the spirits of the
        ancestors of the paramount chief.”</span><a id="noteref_458" name=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“The religion of the Bantu was based upon the

        177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        existence of spirits that could interfere with the affairs of this
        world. These spirits were those of their ancestors and their deceased
        chiefs, the greatest of whom had control over lightning. When the
        spirits became offended or hungry they sent a plague or disaster
        until sacrifices were offered and their wrath or hunger was appeased.
        The head of a family of commoners on such an occasion killed an
        animal, and all ate of the meat, as the hungry ghost was supposed to

        example, in the year 1891 the son of a chief of the Pondomisi tribe
        was arrested for an assault and sent for trial before a colonial
        court. It chanced to be a season of intense heat and severe drought,
        and the Pondomisi tribe attributed these calamities to the wrath of a
        dead chief named Gwanya, very famous in his lifetime, whose body,
        fastened to a log, had been buried under a heap of stones in a deep
        pool of the Lina river. This redoubtable chieftain was the seventh
        ancestor in the direct line of the man who had committed the assault;
        and he warmly resented the indignity which the whites had done to a
        noble scion of his house by consigning him to durance vile. To
        appease the natural indignation of the ghost, the tribesmen killed
        cattle on the banks of the pool which contained his grave, and threw
        the flesh into the water along with new dishes full of beer. The
        prisoner, however, was convicted of the assault and sentenced by the
        ruthless magistrate, who was no respecter of ghosts, to pay a fine.
        But the tribe clubbed together and paid the fine for him; and a few
        days later rain fell in plenty. The mollified ghost had opened the
        celestial sluices.<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another writer,
        describing the religion of the South <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> African Bantus, tells us that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the ancestral spirits love the very things they loved
        before they passed through the flesh; they cherish the same desires
        and have the same antipathies. The living cannot add to the number of
        the wives of ancestral spirits; but they can kill cattle in their
        honour and keep their praise and memory alive on earth. Above all
        things, they can give them beef and beer. And if the living do not
        give them sufficient of these things the spirits are supposed to give
        the people a bad time: they send drought, and sickness, and famine,
        until people kill cattle in their honour. When men are alive they
        love to be praised and flattered, fed and attended to; after death
        they want the very same things, for death does not change
        personality.... In time of drought, or sickness, or great trouble,
        there would be great searchings of heart as to which ancestor had
        been neglected, for the trouble would be supposed to be caused by the
        neglected ancestor. Most of the people would get the subject on their
        nerves (at least, as far as a Kafir could get anything on the leather
        strings which do duty for nerves), and some one would be sure to have
        a vivid dream in which an ancestor would complain that the people had
        not praised him half enough of late. So an ox would be killed, either
        by the head-man of the kraal or by a diviner. Then the man would say
        over the ox as it was being killed, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Cry out,
        ox of So-and-So; listen to us, So-and-So; this is your ox; we praise
        you by all your laud-giving names, and tell of all your deeds; do not
        be angry with us any more; do you not see that this is your ox? Do
        not accuse us of neglecting you; when, forsooth, have we ceased to
        praise you and offer you meat and beer? Take note, then, that here is
        another ox we are offering to you.’</span> When the ox is dead some
        of the meat is mixed with herbs and medicines and placed in a hut
        with a bowlful of blood. This meat is placed in the part of the hut
        where the man loved to sit while he was alive, and some one is told
        off to guard the sacrifice. The meat is left for a night, or longer,
        and the spirits are supposed to come and enjoy the smell, or drink
        the serum which oozes from the meat, and to inhale the smell of the
        beer. The priest or diviner will then sprinkle the people and the
        huts with medicine made from the contents of the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stomach of the ox. He places a little on
        a sherd; when this is dry he burns it and calls on the spirits to
        smell the incense. After the meat has been left for a certain time it
        is taken out and cooked, and eaten by the men near the cattle kraal
        in public.... If the trouble does not vanish after this ceremony the
        people get angry and say to the spirits, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘When have we ceased to kill cattle for you, and when
        have we ever refused to praise you by your praise-names? Why, then,
        do you treat us so shabbily? If you do not behave better we shall
        utterly forget your names, and then what will you do when there is no
        one to praise you? You will have to go and live on grasshoppers. If
        you do not mend your ways we shall forget you. What use is it that we
        kill oxen for you and praise you? You do not give us rain or crops,
        or cause our cattle to bear well; you show no gratitude in return for
        all we do for you. We shall utterly disown you. We shall tell the
        people that, as for us, we have no ancestral spirits, and this will
        be to your shame. We are disgusted with you.’</span> ”</span><a id=

        the sweet savour of beef and beer does not suffice to content Caffre
        ghosts; they share the love of praise and flattery with many gods of
        higher rank.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Basutos,
        an important Bantu people of South Africa, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“each family is supposed to be under the direct influence
        and protection of its ancestors; but the tribe, taken as a whole,
        acknowledges for its national gods the ancestors of the reigning
        sovereign. Thus, the Basutos address their prayers to Monaheng and
        Motlumi, from whom their chiefs are descended. The Baharutsis and the
        Barolongs invoke Tobege and his wife Mampa. Mampa makes known the
        will of her husband, announcing each of her revelations by these
        words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">O re! O
        re!</span></span>’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘He has said! he
        has said!’</span> They make a distinction between the ancient and
        modern divinities. The latter are considered inferior in power, but
        more accessible; hence this formula, which is often used:
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘New gods! entreat the ancient gods for
        us!’</span> In all countries spirits are more the objects of fear
        than of love. A deep feeling of terror generally accompanies the idea
        that the dead dispose of the lot of the living. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The ancients spoke much of incensed
        shades. If they sacrificed to the manes, it was generally in order to
        appease them. These ideas perfectly correspond to those of the
        Basutos. They conjure rather than pray; although they seek to gain
        favours, they think more of averting chastisement. Their
        predominating idea as to their ancestors is, that they are
        continually endeavouring to draw them to themselves. Every disease is
        attributed to them; thus medicine among these people is almost
        entirely a religious affair. The first thing is to discover, by means
        of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">litaola</span></span> (divining bones), under
        the influence of what <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">molimo</span></span> the patient is supposed to
        be. Is it an ancestor on the father's side or the mother's? According
        as fate decides, the paternal or maternal uncle will offer the
        purifying sacrifice, but rarely the father or brother. This sacrifice
        alone can render efficacious the medicines prescribed by the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ngaka</span></span> (doctor).... As soon as a
        person is dead he takes his place among the family gods. His remains
        are deposited in the cattle-pen. An ox is immolated over his grave:
        this is the first oblation made to the new divinity, and at the same
        time an act of intercession in his favour, serving to ensure his
        happy reception in the subterranean regions. All those present aid in
        sprinkling the grave, and repeat the following prayer: <span class=

        nights.’</span> ”</span><a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“On the one hand, the ancestor-gods are truly

        181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        these ancestor-gods, to wit, <span class="tei tei-q">“those of the
        family, and those of the country, the latter being those of the
        reigning family. They do not differ as regards their nature. In
        national calamities those of the country are invoked, whilst, for
        purely family matters, those of the family are called upon. Moreover,
        each family has two sets of gods, those on the father's side and
        those on the mother's, those of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bakokwana</span></span>. They are equal in
        dignity. Both can be invoked, and the divinatory bones are always
        asked to which the offering must be made. It seems, however, as if
        the gods on the mother's side were more tender-hearted and more
        popular than those on the father's. The reason for this is, perhaps,
        that relations are easier with the family of the mother than with
        that of the father. It is also just possible that it is a relic of
        the matriarchal period, when the ancestors of the mother only were
        known, and consequently invoked. At any rate, the part played by
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        beneath; the practice of breaking a man's assagais, before they are

        the grave; while it appears to be generally thought that, if the
        earth were removed from the grave, the ghost would return and
        frighten his descendants. When spirits have entered the future state,
        they are believed to possess great power; prosperity is ascribed to
        their favour, and misfortune to their anger; they are elevated in
        fact to the rank of deities, and (except where the Great-Great is
        worshipped concurrently with them) they are the only objects of a
        Kafir's adoration. Their attention <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        now why do you consent to diminish your own kraal? Build on us as you
        have begun, let it be large, that your offspring, still here above,
        may increase, increasing in knowledge of you, whence cometh great
        power.’</span> Sometimes they make beer for the ghosts, and leave a
        little in the pot, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It will be eaten
        by the ghosts that they may grant an abundant harvest again, that we
        may not have a famine.’</span> If one is on the point of being
        injured by anything, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I was

        our divinity, which was still watching over me.’</span> Perhaps he
        slaughters a goat in honour of the same, and puts the gall on his
        head; and when the goat cries out for pain of being killed, he says,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yes, then, there is your animal, let it cry,
        that ye may hear, ye our gods who have preserved me; I myself am
        desirous of living on thus a long time here on the earth; why then do
        you call me to account, since I think I am all right in respect to
        you? And while I live, I put my trust in you, our paternal and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Black people,”</span> say the Zulus, <span class=

        the dead of their tribe. Speaking generally, the head of each house
        is worshipped by the children of that house; for they do not know the
        ancients who are dead, nor their laud-giving names, nor their names.
        But their father whom they knew is the head by whom they begin and
        end in their prayer, for they know him best, and his love for his
        children; they remember his kindness to them whilst he was living;
        they compare his treatment of them whilst he was living, support
        themselves by it, and say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘He will still
        treat us in the same way now he is dead. We do not know why he should
        regard others besides us; he will regard us only.’</span> So it is
        then although they worship the many Amatongo of their tribe, making a
        great fence around them for their protection; yet their father is far
        before all others when they worship the Amatongo. Their father is a
        great treasure to them even when he is dead. And those of his
        children who are already grown up know him thoroughly, his
        gentleness, and his bravery. And if there is illness in the village,
        the eldest son lauds him with the laud-giving names which he gained
        when fighting with the enemy, and at the same time lauds all the
        other Amatongo; the son reproves the father, saying, <span class=

        after? Let us die all of us, that we may see into whose house you

        take courage saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘He has heard; he will
        come and treat our diseases, and they will cease.’</span> Such then
        is the faith which children have in the Itongo [ancestral spirit]
        which is their father. And if there is a chief wife of a village, who
        has given birth to children, and if her husband is not dead, her
        Itongo is much reverenced by her husband and all the children. And
        that chief wife becomes an Itongo which takes great care of the

        among the Zulus it is the spirits of those who have just died,

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
        missionaries inquired into the religious ideas of the Herero, a Bantu
        tribe of German South-West Africa, they heard much of a certain
        Mukuru, whom at first they took to be the great god of heaven and
        earth. Accordingly they adopted Mukuru as the native name for the
        Christian God, and set out on their mission to preach the glad
        tidings of Mukuru and his divine Son to the poor benighted heathen.
        But their first experiences were disconcerting. Again and again when
        they arrived in a village and announced their intention to the chief,
        they were brought up very short by that great man, who told them with
        an air of astonishment that he himself was Mukuru. For example,
        Messrs. Büttner and Irle paid a visit to an old chief named Tjenda
        and remonstrated with him on the impropriety of which he had been
        guilty in giving a baptized girl in marriage to a native gentleman
        whose domestic arrangements were framed on the polygamous patriarchal
        pattern. <span class="tei tei-q">“Mukuru will punish you for
        that,”</span> said Mr. Büttner. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What?”</span> roared the chief. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who's Mukuru? Why, I am Mukuru in my own tribe,”</span>
        and he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name=
        "Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> bundled the two
        missionaries out of the village. A repetition of these painful
        incidents at last impressed on the minds of the missionaries the
        conviction that Mukuru was not God at all but merely the head of a
        family, an ancestor, whether alive or dead.<a id="noteref_477" name=
        "noteref_477" href="#note_477"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> They
        ascertained at the same time that the Herero recognize a good god who
        dwells in heaven and bears the name of Ndjambi Karunga. But they do
        not worship him nor bring him offerings, because he is so kind that
        he hurts nobody, and therefore they need not fear him. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Rather they share the opinion of the other Bantu tribes
        that Ndjambi, the good Creator, has withdrawn to heaven and left the
        government on earth to the demons.”</span><a id="noteref_478" name=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is true that the Herero are acquainted
        with punishment for what is bad. But that punishment they ascribe to
        Mukuru or their ancestors. It is their ancestors (<span class=

        they must fear; it is they who are angry and can bring danger and
        misfortune on a man. So it is intelligible that the whole of their
        worship turns, not on Ndjambi Karunga, but on their ancestors. It is
        in order to win and keep their favour, to avert their displeasure and
        wrath, in short to propitiate them, that the Herero bring their many
        offerings; they do so not out of gratitude, but out of fear, not out
        of love, but out of terror. Their religion is a worship of ancestors
        with here and there touches of fetishism.”</span><a id="noteref_480"

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus among the Herero, as among all Bantu

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The religion of
        the Ovambo, another Bantu tribe of German South-West Africa, is
        similar. They also recognize a great being named Kalunga, who created
        the world and man, but they neither fear nor worship him. A far
        greater part is played in the religion of the Ovambo by their belief
        in spirits, and amongst the worshipful spirits a conspicuous place is
        assigned to the souls of the dead. Every man leaves behind him at
        death a spirit, which continues to exist on earth and can influence
        the living; for example, it may enter into their bodies and thereby
        cause all sorts of sickness. However, the souls of ordinary dead men
        can exert their influence only on members of their own families; the
        souls of dead chiefs, on the other hand, have power over the rain,
        which they can either give or withhold. To these powerful spirits a
        portion of the new corn is offered at harvest as a thank-offering for
        their forbearance in not visiting the people with sickness, and above
        all for their bounty in sending down the fertilizing showers on the
        crops. The souls of dead magicians are particularly dreaded; and to
        prevent the multiplication of these dangerous spirits it is customary
        to dismember their bodies, severing the arms and legs from the trunk
        and cutting the tongue out of the mouth. If these precautions are
        taken immediately after death, the soul of the dead man cannot become
        a dangerous ghost; the mutilation of his body has practically
        disarmed his spirit.<a id="noteref_483" name="noteref_483" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Wahehe, a
        Bantu tribe of German East Africa, believe in a great invisible
        spirit named Nguruhi, who created the world and rules both human
        destiny and the elements. He it is who makes the rain to fall, the
        sun to shine, the wind to blow, the thunder to roll, and the crops to
        grow. <span class="tei tei-q">“This god is accordingly conceived as
        all-powerful, yet with the limitation that he only exercises a

        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">masoka</span></span>), but his relation to them
        has not been further thought out. With this Supreme Being the people
        hold no intercourse by means of prayer, sacrifice, or in any other
        way. He stands remote from the religious life of the Wahehe and
        really serves only as an explanation of all those things and events
        which are otherwise inexplicable. All religious intercourse, all
        worship centres alone on the spirits of the dead. Hence if we speak

        of ancestors.”</span><a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href=

        spirit (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">m'soka</span></span>), invisible and endowed
        with complete liberty of motion. Even the youngest children have
        souls which rank among the ancestral spirits at death. Hence the
        great multitude of the dead comprises spirits of all ages, from the
        infant one day old to the grey-haired patriarch. They are good or bad
        according as they were good or bad in life, and their social position
        also is unchanged. He who was powerful in life is powerful also in
        death; he who was a nobody among men is a nobody also among the
        spirits. Hence the ghost of a great man can do more for the living
        than the ghost of a common man; and the ghost of a man can do more
        than the ghost of a woman. Yet even the meanest ghost has power over
        the greatest living man, who can only defend himself by appealing for
        help to stronger ancestral spirits. Thus while the Supreme Being
        exercises a general superintendence over affairs, the real
        administration is in the hands of the ancestral spirits. While he,
        for example, regulates the weather as a whole, it is the ghosts who
        cause each particular shower to fall or the sun to break out in glory
        from the clouds. If he sends plagues on the whole people or stays the
        ravages of disease, it is the ghosts who make each individual sick or
        sound. These powerful spirits exert themselves especially to help
        their descendants, though they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> do not hesitate to plague their own kith and
        kin if they think themselves neglected. They flit freely through the
        air and perch on trees, mountains, and so forth, but they lodge by
        preference at their graves, and you are always sure of finding them
        there, if you wish to consult them.<a id="noteref_485" name=

        the number of graves and consequently of sacrificial places is
        strictly limited. The spirits of the dead appear to the living most
        commonly in dreams to give them information or warning, but oftener
        to chide and torment them. So the sleeper wakes in a fright and
        consults a diviner, who directs him what he must do in order to
        appease the angry ghost. Following the directions of his spiritual
        adviser the man sacrifices an ox, or it may be only a sheep or a
        fowl, at the tomb of one of his ancestors, prays to the ghost, and
        having scattered a few morsels of the victim's flesh on the grave,
        and spat a mouthful of beer upon it, retires with his family to feast
        on the remainder of the carcase. Such sacrifices to the dead are
        offered on occasion of sickness, the lack of male heirs, a threatened
        war, an intended journey, in short, before any important undertaking
        of which the issue is doubtful; and, they are accompanied by prayers
        for health, victory, good harvests, and so forth.<a id="noteref_488"

        the worship of dead chiefs or kings among the Bantu tribes of
        Northern Rhodesia. The spirits of dead chiefs had priestesses to wait
        upon them, who were called the <span class="tei tei-q">“wives of the
        departed.”</span> These were elderly women who led a celibate life
        and swept the huts dedicated to the ghosts of the chiefs. The aid of
        these dead potentates was invoked in time of war and in seasons of
        drought, and special offerings were brought to their shrines at
        harvest.<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href=

        diviner announced that a drought was caused by the spirits of dead
        chiefs or kings buried at Mwaruli, a bull would be sent to be
        sacrificed to the souls of the deceased rulers; or if the drought was
        severe, a human victim would be despatched, and the high priest would
        keep him caged in a stoutly woven fish-basket, until the preparations
        for the sacrifice were complete.<a id="noteref_492" name=

        the Yombe no one might eat of the first-fruits of the crops until the
        living chief had sacrificed a bull before the tomb of his
        grandfather, and had deposited pots of fresh beer and porridge, made
        from the first-fruits, in front of the shrine. The ground about the
        tomb was then carefully weeded, and the blood of the sacrificial
        victim sprinkled on the freshly turned up soil and on the rafters of
        the little hut. After thanking the ghost of his grandfather for the
        harvest, and begging him to partake of the first-fruits, the chief
        and his train withdrew to feast on the carcase and the fresh porridge
        and beer at the village.<a id="noteref_493" name="noteref_493" href=

        the older men of the tribe would pray daily for victory to the
        spirits of the dead kings, his predecessors. The day before the army
        was to set forth, the great war-drum boomed out and the warriors
        flocked together from the outlying districts under their respective
        captains. In the dusk of the evening the king and the elderly women,
        who passed for the wives of the dead kings and tended their shrines
        at the capital, went and prayed at these shrines that the souls of
        the departed monarchs would keep the war-path free from foes and lead
        the king in a straight course to the enemy's stockade. These solemn
        prayers the king led in person, and the women beat their bare breasts
        as they joined in the earnest appeal. Next morning the whole army was
        marshalled in front of the ghost-huts of the dead kings: the living
        king danced a war-dance before his ancestors, while his chief wife
        sprinkled him with holy flour; and all prostrated themselves in
        supplication before the shrines.<a id="noteref_494" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among these tribes
        of Northern Rhodesia the spirits of dead chiefs or kings sometimes
        take possession of the bodies of live men or women and prophesy
        through their mouths. When the spirit of a dead chief comes over a
        man, he begins to roar like a lion, whereupon the women gather
        together and beat the drums, shouting that the chief has come to
        visit the village. The man thus temporarily inspired will prophesy of
        future wars or impending attacks by lions. While the inspiration
        lasts, he may eat nothing cooked by fire, but only unfermented dough.
        However, the spirit of a departed chief takes possession of women
        oftener than of men. <span class="tei tei-q">“These women assert that
        they are possessed by the soul of some dead chief, and when they feel
        the divine afflatus, whiten their faces to attract attention, and
        anoint themselves with flour, which has a religious and sanctifying
        potency. One of their number beats a drum, and the others dance,
        singing at the same time a weird song, with curious intervals.
        Finally, when they have arrived at the requisite pitch of religious
        exaltation, the possessed woman falls to the ground, and bursts forth
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193"
        id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> into a low and almost
        inarticulate chant, which has a most uncanny effect. All are silent
        at once, and the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        Sometimes the spirits of departed chiefs are reincarnated in animals,
        which are then revered as the abodes of the dead rulers. Thus the
        paramount chief of the Amambwe is incarnated after death in the form
        of a young lion, while Bisa and Wiwa chiefs come back in the shape of
        pythons. In one of the rest-houses near Fife a tame python waxed fat
        on the offerings of fowls and sour beer which the Winamwanga
        presented to it in the fond belief that it housed the spirit of one
        of their dead chiefs. One day unfortunately for himself the reptile
        deity ventured to dispute the possession of the rest-house with a
        German cattle-dealer who was passing by; a discharge of shot settled
        the dispute in favour of the cattle-dealer, and the worshippers of
        the deity beheld him no more.<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496"

        people who worship the spirits of their dead kings are the Barotse or
        Marotse of the Upper Zambesi. The Barotse believe in a supreme god,
        the creator of all things, whom they call Niambe. He lives in the
        sun, and by his marriage with the moon begat the world, the animals,
        and last of all men. But the cunning and ferocity of his creature man
        terrified the beneficent creator, so that he fled from earth and
        escaped up the thread of a spider's web to heaven. There he still
        retains a certain power to interfere in human affairs, and that is
        why men sometimes pray and sacrifice to him. For example, the
        worshipper salutes the rising sun and offers him a vessel of water,
        no doubt to quench the thirst of the deity on his hot journey across
        the sky. Again, when a long drought has prevailed, a black ox is
        sacrificed to Niambe <span class="tei tei-q">“as a symbol of the
        clouds big with the longed-for rain.”</span> And before they sow the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet while they
        acknowledge the divine supremacy of Niambe, the Barotse address their
        prayers most frequently to the inferior deities, the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ditino</span></span>, who are the deified kings
        of the country. The tombs of the departed monarchs may be seen near
        the villages which they inhabited in life. Each tomb stands in a
        grove of beautiful trees and is encircled by a tall palisade of
        pointed stakes, covered with fine mats, like the palisade which
        surrounds the royal residence of a living king. Such an enclosure is
        sacred; the people are forbidden to enter it lest they should disturb
        the ghost of him who sleeps below. But the inhabitants of the nearest
        village are charged with the duty of keeping the tomb and the
        enclosure in good order, repairing the palisade, and replacing the
        mats when they are worn out. Once a month, at the new moon, the women
        sweep not only the grave and the enclosure but the whole village. The
        guardian of the tomb is at the same time a priest; he acts as
        intermediary between the god and the people who come to pray to the
        deity. He bears the title of Ngomboti; he alone has the right to
        enter the sacred enclosure; the profane multitude must stand at a
        respectful distance. Even the king himself, when he comes to consult
        one of his ancestors, is forbidden to set foot on the holy ground. In
        presence of the god, or, as they call him, the Master of the Tomb,
        the monarch must bear himself like a slave in the presence of his
        lord. He kneels down near the entrance, claps his hands, and gives
        the royal salute; and from within the enclosure the priest solemnly
        returns the salute, just as the king himself, when he holds his
        court, returns the salute of his subjects. Then the suppliant,
        whether king or commoner, makes his petition to the deity and
        deposits his offering; for no man may pray to the god with empty
        hands. Inside the enclosure, close to the entrance, is a hole which
        is supposed to serve as a channel of communication with the spirit of
        the deified king. In it the offerings are placed. Often they consist
        of milk which is poured into the hole; and the faster it drains away,
        the more favourably inclined is the god thought to be to the
        petitioner. More solid offerings, such as flesh, clothes, and glass
        beads, become the property of the priest after they have been allowed
        to lie for a decent time beside the sacred <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> aperture of the tomb. The spirits of dead kings
        are thus consulted on matters of public concern as well as by private
        individuals touching their own affairs. If a war is to be waged, if a
        plague is raging among the people or a murrain among the cattle, if
        the land is parched with drought, in short, if any danger threatens
        or any calamity has afflicted the country, recourse is had to these
        local gods, dwelling each in his shady grove, not far from the abodes
        of the living. They are near, but the great god in heaven is far
        away. What wonder, therefore, that their help is often sought while
        he is neglected? They are national heroes as well as gods; their
        history is remembered; men tell of the doughty deeds they did in
        their lifetime; why should they not be able to succour their votaries
        now that they have put on immortality? All over the country these
        temple-tombs may be seen. They serve as historical monuments to
        recall to the people the names of their former kings and the annals
        of their country. One of the most popular of the royal shrines is
        near Senanga at the southern end of the great plain of the Barotse.
        Voyagers who go down the Zambesi do not fail to pay their devotions
        at the shrine, that the god of the place may make their voyage to
        prosper and may guard the frail canoe from shipwreck in the rush and
        roar of the rapids; and when they return in safety they repair again
        to the sacred spot to deposit a thank-offering for the protection of
        the deity.<a id="noteref_498" name="noteref_498" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
        examples suffice to prove that the worship of dead chiefs and kings
        has been an important, perhaps we may even say, the most important
        element in the religion of many African tribes. Regarded from the
        native point of view nothing could be more natural. The king rules
        over his people in life; and since all these tribes entertain a firm
        and unquestioning belief not only in the existence but in the power
        of the spirits of the dead, they necessarily conclude that of all the
        departed spirits none can be so potent for good or evil, none
        therefore need to be propitiated so earnestly by prayer and
        sacrifice, as the souls of dead kings. Thus while every family
        worships privately the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg
        196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        spirits of its own ancestors, the whole tribe worships publicly the
        spirits of its departed monarchs, paying to each of these invisible
        potentates, whose reality they never dream of doubting, a homage of
        precisely the same sort as that which they render to his living
        successor on the throne. Such a religion of the dead is by no means
        incompatible with the recognition of higher spiritual powers who may
        have an origin quite independent of the worship of ancestors. We have
        seen in point of fact that many tribes, whose practical religion is
        concentrated chiefly on their dead, nevertheless acknowledge the
        existence of a supreme god, the creator of man and of all things,
        whom they do not regard as a glorified ghost. The Baganda, the most
        progressive and advanced of all the Bantu tribes, had a whole
        pantheon of gods whom they sharply distinguished from the worshipful
        spirits of their forefathers.</p>

        the magic touch of time, which distorts and magnifies the past,
        especially among peoples who see it only through the haze of oral
        tradition, has glorified and transfigured many a dead man into a
        deity. This at all events seems to have been the history of some of
        the Baganda gods. On this subject our best authority says that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the principal gods appear to have been at

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Mukasa held the highest rank among the gods
        of Uganda. He was a benign god; he never asked for the life of any
        human being, but animals were sacrificed to him at the yearly
        festivals, and also at other times when the king, or a leading chief,
        wished to consult him. He had nothing to do with war, but sought to
        heal the bodies and minds of men. He was the god of plenty; he gave
        the people an increase of food, cattle, and children. From the
        legends still current it seems to be almost certain that he was a
        human being who, because of his benevolence, came to be regarded as a
        god.... The legends about Mukasa are of great interest; they show how

        tangible evidence that his brother the war-god Kibuka was so. For
        like the dead kings of Uganda, Kibuka was worshipped in a great
        conical hut resembling the huts which living people inhabit: like
        them, his spirit was supposed to enter from time to time into the
        body of his priest and to give oracles through him; and like them he
        was represented in his temple by his personal relics, his jawbone and
        his navel-string, which were rescued from the ruins of his temple and
        now rest in the Ethnological Museum at Cambridge. In face of this
        complete parallelism between the god and the kings whose personal
        existence is not open to question, it seems difficult to doubt that
        Kibuka was once like them a real man, and that he spoke with the
        jawbone and made bodily use of the other corporeal organs which were
        preserved in his temple.<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501" href=

        worship, the tomb of Osiris was identified with the tomb of King
        Khent, one of the earliest monarchs of the first Egyptian dynasty,
        and that in this tomb were found a woman's richly jewelled arm and a
        human skull lacking the lower jawbone, which may well be the head of
        the king himself and the arm of his queen. The carved monument of
        Osiris which was found in the sepulchral chamber appears indeed to be
        a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name=
        "Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> work of late Egyptian
        art, but it may have replaced an earlier sarcophagus. Certainly we
        may reasonably suppose that the identification of the tomb of Osiris
        with the tomb of King Khent was very ancient; for though the priests
        may have renewed the sculptured effigy of the dead god, they would
        hardly dare to shift the site of the Holy Sepulchre.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a> Now the
        sepulchre is distant about a mile and a half from the temple in which
        Osiris was worshipped as a god. There is thus a curious coincidence,
        if there is nothing more, between the worship of Osiris and the
        worship of the dead kings of Uganda. As a dead king of Uganda was
        worshipped in a temple, while his headless body reposed at some
        distance in a royal tomb, and his head, without the lower jawbone,
        was buried by itself near the grave, so Osiris was worshipped in a
        temple not far from the royal tomb which tradition identified with
        his grave. Perhaps after all tradition was right. It is possible,
        though it would be very rash to affirm, that Osiris was no other than
        the historical King Khent of the first dynasty;<a id="noteref_503"
        name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a> that
        the skull found in the tomb is the skull of Osiris himself; and that
        while it reposed in the grave the missing jawbone was preserved, like
        the jawbone of a dead king of Uganda, as a holy and perhaps
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199"
        id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> oracular relic in the
        neighbouring temple. If that were so, we should be almost driven to
        conclude that the bejewelled woman's arm found in the tomb of Osiris
        is the arm of Isis.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In support of the
        conclusion that the myth and religion of Osiris grew up round the
        revered memory of a dead man we may quote the words in which the
        historian of European morals describes the necessity under which the
        popular imagination labours of embodying its cherished ideals in
        living persons. He is referring to the dawn of the age of chivalry,
        when in the morning twilight the heroic figure of Charlemagne rose
        like a bright star above the political horizon, to be thenceforth
        encircled by a halo of romance like the nimbus that shone round the
        head of Osiris. <span class="tei tei-q">“In order that the tendencies
        I have described should acquire their full force, it was necessary
        that they should be represented or illustrated in some great
        personage, who, by the splendour and the beauty of his career, could
        fascinate the imaginations of men. It is much easier to govern great
        masses of men through their imagination than through their reason.
        Moral principles rarely act powerfully upon the world, except by way
        of example or ideals. When the course of events has been to glorify
        the ascetic or monarchical or military spirit, a great saint, or
        sovereign, or soldier will arise, who will concentrate in one
        dazzling focus the blind tendencies of his time, kindle the
        enthusiasm and fascinate the imagination of the people. But for the
        prevailing tendency, the great man would not have arisen, or would
        not have exercised his great influence. But for the great man, whose
        career appealed vividly to the imagination, the prevailing tendency
        would never have acquired its full intensity.”</span><a id=

          concluded our inquiry into the nature and worship of the three
          Oriental deities Adonis, Attis, and Osiris. The substantial
          similarity of their mythical character justifies us in treating of
          them together. All three apparently embodied the powers of
          fertility in general and of vegetation in particular. All three
          were believed to have died and risen again from the dead; and the
          divine death and resurrection of all three were dramatically
          represented at annual festivals, which their worshippers celebrated
          with alternate transports of sorrow and joy, of weeping and
          exultation. The natural phenomena thus mythically conceived and
          mythically represented were the great changes of the seasons,
          especially the most striking and impressive of all, the decay and
          revival of vegetation; and the intention of the sacred dramas was
          to refresh and strengthen, by sympathetic magic, the failing
          energies of nature, in order that the trees should bear fruit, that
          the corn should ripen, that men and animals should reproduce their
          kinds.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the three
          gods did not stand by themselves. The mythical personification of
          nature, of which all three were in at least one aspect the
          products, required that each of them should be coupled with a
          goddess, and in each case it appears that originally the goddess
          was a more powerful and important personage than the god. At all
          events it is always the god rather than the goddess who comes to a
          sad end, and whose death is annually mourned. Thus, whereas Osiris
          was slain by Typhon, his divine spouse Isis survived <span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and brought him to life again. This
          feature of the myth seems to indicate that in the beginning Isis
          was, what Astarte and Cybele always continued to be, the stronger
          divinity of the pair. Now the superiority thus assigned to the
          goddess over the god is most naturally explained as the result of a
          social system in which maternity counted for more than paternity,
          descent being traced and property handed down through women rather
          than through men. At all events this explanation cannot be deemed
          intrinsically improbable if we can show that the supposed cause has
          produced the very same effect among existing peoples, about whose

          mother's kin. In Jowai he neither lives nor eats in his wife's
          house, but visits it only after dark. In the veneration of

          other spirits to whom propitiation is offered are mainly female,
          though here male personages also figure. The powers of sickness and
          death are all female, and these are those most frequently

          the existence of the clan depends entirely on the life of the
          women, not at all upon the life of the men. If the women survive,
          it is no matter though every man of the clan should perish; for the
          women will, as usual, marry men of another clan, and their
          offspring will inherit their mother's clan, thereby prolonging its
          existence. Whereas if the women of the clan all die out, the clan
          necessarily becomes extinct, even though every man of it should
          survive; for the men must, as usual, marry women of another clan,
          and their offspring will inherit their mothers' clan, not the clan
          of their fathers, which accordingly, with the death of the fathers,
          is wiped out from the community. Hence in these islands women bear
          the titles of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          Indeed, in one passage our principal authority speaks of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the predominance of feminine influence in

          For the Pelew Islanders subsist mainly on the produce of their taro

          branch of Pelew agriculture, which is of paramount importance for
          the subsistence of the people, is left entirely in the hands of the
          women. This fact may have contributed materially to the
          predominance of female influence in the social condition of the
          people. The women do not merely bestow life on the people, they
          also do that which is most essential for the preservation of life,
          and therefore they are called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Adhalál a
          pelú</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Mothers of the

          Only their offspring enjoy the privilege of membership of the state
          (the children of the men are, strictly speaking, strangers

          esteemed and treated as equal to deities even in their lifetime,

          it is impossible to regard the assignment of the taro cultivation
          to women as a consequence of their subordinate position in society:
          the women themselves do not so regard it. The richest woman of the
          village looks with pride on her taro patch, and although she has
          female followers enough to allow her merely to superintend the work
          without taking part in it, she nevertheless prefers to lay aside
          her fine apron and to betake herself to the deep <span class=

          hides her nakedness, with a little mat on her back to protect her
          from the burning heat of the sun, and with a shade of banana leaves
          for her eyes. There, dripping with sweat in the burning sun and
          coated with mud to the hips and over the elbows, she toils to set
          the younger women a good example. Moreover, as in every other
          occupation, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kaliths</span></span>, the gods, must also be
          invoked, and who could be better fitted for the discharge of so

          seems clear that in any agricultural people who, like the Pelew
          Islanders, retain mother-kin and depute the labours of husbandry to
          women, the conception of a great Mother Goddess, the divine source
          of all fertility, might easily originate. Perhaps the same social
          and industrial conditions may have combined to develop the great
          Mother Goddesses of Western Asia and Egypt.</p>

          hair hanging loose in token of his superhuman parentage. It is
          thought that no mortal man would dare to intrigue with one of these

          in these islands men as well as women are often possessed by a
          deity and speak in his name. Under his inspiration they mimic,
          often with great histrionic skill, the particular appearance and
          manner which are believed to be characteristic of the indwelling
          divinity. These inspired men (<span class=

          consideration and exert a powerful influence over the whole
          community. They always acquire wealth in the exercise of their
          profession. When they are not themselves chiefs, they are treated
          as chiefs or even preferred to them. In not a few places the deity
          whom <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name=
          "Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they personate is
          also the political head of the land; and in that case his inspired
          priest, however humble his origin, ranks as a spiritual king and
          rules over all the chiefs. Indeed we are told that, with the
          physical and intellectual decay of the race, the power of the
          priests is more and more in the ascendant and threatens, if
          unchecked, to develop before long into an absolute theocracy which
          will swallow up every other form of government.<a id="noteref_524"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          present, or at least the recent, state of society and religion in
          the Pelew Islands presents some interesting parallels to the social
          and religious condition of Western Asia and Egypt in early days, if
          the conclusions reached in this work are correct. In both regions
          we see a society based on mother-kin developing a religion in which
          goddesses of the clan originally occupied the foremost place,
          though in later times, as the clans coalesced into states, the old
          goddesses have been rivalled and to some extent supplanted by the
          new male gods of the enlarged pantheon. But in the religion of the
          Pelew Islanders, as in that of the Khasis and the ancient
          Egyptians, the balance of power has never wholly shifted from the
          female to the male line, because society has never passed from
          mother-kin to father-kin. And in the Pelew Islands as in the
          ancient East we see the tide of political power running strongly in
          the direction of theocracy, the people resigning the conduct of
          affairs into the hands of men who claimed to rule them in the name
          of the gods. In the Pelew Islands such men might have developed
          into divine kings like those of Babylon and Egypt, if the natural
          course of evolution had not been cut short by the intervention of
          Europe.<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evidence of
          the Khasis and the Pelew Islanders, two peoples very remote and
          very different from each other, suffices to prove that the
          influence which mother-kin may exert on religion is real and deep.
          But in order <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg
          209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to dissipate misapprehensions, which appear to be rife on this
          subject, it may be well to remind or inform the reader that the
          ancient and widespread custom of tracing descent and inheriting
          property through the mother alone does not by any means imply that
          the government of the tribes which observe the custom is in the
          hands of women; in short, it should always be borne in mind that
          mother-kin does not mean mother-rule. On the contrary, the practice
          of mother-kin prevails most extensively amongst the lowest savages,
          with whom woman, instead of being the ruler of man, is always his
          drudge and often little better than his slave. Indeed, so far is
          the system from implying any social superiority of women that it
          probably took its rise from what we should regard as their deepest
          degradation, to wit, from a state of society in which the relations
          of the sexes were so loose and vague that children could not be
          fathered on any particular man.<a id="noteref_526" name=

              politically to women.</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we pass
          from the purely savage state to that higher plane of culture in
          which the accumulation of property, and especially of landed
          property, has become a powerful instrument of social and political
          influence, we naturally find that wherever the ancient preference
          for the female line of descent has been retained, it tends to
          increase the importance and enhance the dignity of woman; and her
          aggrandizement is most marked in princely families, where she
          either herself holds royal authority as well as private property,
          or at least transmits them both to her consort or her children. But
          this social advance of women has never been carried so far as to
          place men as a whole in a position of political subordination to
          them. Even where the system of mother-kin in regard to descent and
          property has prevailed most fully, the actual government has
          generally, if not invariably, remained in the hands of men.
          Exceptions have no doubt occurred; women have occasionally arisen
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name=

          of character have swayed for a time the destinies of their people.
          But such exceptions are rare and their effects transitory; they do
          not affect the truth of the general rule that human society has
          been governed in the past and, human nature remaining the same, is
          likely to be governed in the future, mainly by masculine force and
          masculine intelligence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this rule the
          Khasis, with their elaborate system of mother-kin, form no
          exception. For among them, while landed property is both
          transmitted through women and held by women alone, political power
          is transmitted indeed through women, but is held by men; in other
          words, the Khasi tribes are, with a single exception, governed by
          kings, not by queens. And even in the one tribe, which is nominally
          ruled by women, the real power is delegated by the reigning queen
          or High Priestess to her son, her nephew, or a more distant male
          relation. In all the other tribes the kingship may be held by a
          woman only on the failure of all male heirs in the female
          line.<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href=

          far is mother-kin from implying mother-rule. A Khasi king inherits
          power in right of his mother, but he exercises it in his own.
          Similarly the Pelew Islanders, in spite of their system of
          mother-kin, are governed by chiefs, not by chieftainesses. It is
          true that there are chieftainesses, and that they indirectly
          exercise much influence; but their direct authority is limited to
          the affairs of women, especially to the administration of the

          assume that the practice has been the same among all the many
          peoples who have retained the ancient system of mother-kin under a
          monarchical constitution. In Africa, for example, the chieftainship
          or kingship often descends in the female line, but it is men, not
          women, who inherit it.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href=
          "#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          theory of a gynaecocracy is in truth a dream of visionaries and
          pedants. And equally chimerical is the idea that the predominance
          of goddesses under a system of mother-kin like that of the Khasis
          is a creation of the female mind. If women ever created gods, they
          would be more likely to give them masculine than feminine features.
          In point of fact the great religious ideals which have permanently
          impressed themselves on the world seem always to have been a
          product of the male imagination. Men make gods and women worship
          them. The combination of ancestor-worship with mother-kin furnishes
          a simple and sufficient explanation of the superiority of goddesses
          over gods in a state of society where these conditions prevail. Men
          naturally assign the first place in their devotions to the
          ancestress from whom they trace their descent. We need not resort
          to a fantastic hypothesis of the preponderance of the feminine
          fancy in order to account for the facts.</p>

          when we have brushed aside these cobwebs, as we must do, we are
          still left face to face with the solid fact of the wide prevalence
          of mother-kin, that is, of a social system which traces descent and
          transmits property through women and not through men. That a social
          system so widely spread and so deeply rooted should have affected
          the religion of the peoples who practise it, may reasonably be
          inferred, especially when we remember that in primitive communities
          the social relations of the gods commonly reflect the social
          relations of their worshippers. How the system of mother-kin may
          mould religious ideas and customs, creating goddesses and assigning
          at least a nominal superiority to priestesses over priests, is
          shown with perfect lucidity by the example of the Khasis, and
          hardly less clearly by the example of the Pelew Islanders. It
          cannot therefore be rash to hold that what the system has certainly
          done for these peoples, it may well have done for many more. But
          unfortunately through lack of documentary evidence we are seldom
          able to trace its influence so clearly.</p>

          mother-kin in the lands where the great goddesses Astarte and
          Cybele were worshipped is a matter of inference only. In later
          times father-kin had certainly displaced mother-kin among the
          Semitic worshippers of Astarte, and probably the same change had
          taken place among the Phrygian worshippers of Cybele. Yet the older

          we may conjecture that in former times it was widely spread through
          Asia Minor. The secluded situation and rugged mountains of Lycia
          favoured the survival of a native language and of native
          institutions long after these had disappeared from the wide plains
          and fertile valleys which lay on the highroads of war and commerce.
          Lycia was to Asia Minor what the highlands of Wales and of Scotland
          have been to Britain, the last entrenchments where the old race
          stood at bay. And even among the Semites of antiquity, though
          father-kin finally prevailed in matters of descent and property,
          traces of an older system of mother-kin, with its looser sexual
          relations, appear to have long survived in the sphere of religion.
          At all events one of the most learned and acute of Semitic scholars
          adduced what he regarded as evidence sufficient to prove
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that in old Arabian religion gods and

          to us seems strange and unnatural, was by no means a whim of the
          reigning Ptolemies; on the contrary, these Macedonian conquerors
          appear, with characteristic prudence, to have borrowed the custom
          from their Egyptian predecessors for the express purpose of
          conciliating native prejudice. In the eyes of the Egyptians
          <span class="tei tei-q">“marriage between brother and sister was
          the best of marriages, and it acquired an ineffable degree of
          sanctity when the brother and sister who contracted it were

          did the principle apply only to gods and kings. The common people
          acted on it in their daily life. They regarded marriages between
          brothers and sisters as the most natural and reasonable of

          that such unions were the rule, not the exception, in ancient
          Egypt, and that they continued to form the majority of marriages
          long after the Romans had obtained a firm footing in the country.
          As we cannot suppose that Roman influence was used to promote a

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would
          doubtless be a mistake to treat these marriages as a relic of
          savagery, as a survival of a tribal communism which knew no bar to
          the intercourse of the sexes. For such a theory would not explain
          why union with a sister was not only allowed, but preferred to all
          others. The true motive of that preference was most probably the
          wish of brothers to obtain for their own use the family property,
          which belonged of right to their sisters, and which otherwise they
          would have seen in the enjoyment of strangers, the husbands of
          their sisters. This is the system which in Ceylon is known as
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">beena</span></span> marriage. Under it the
          daughter, not the son, is the heir. She stays at home, and her
          husband comes and lives with her in the house; but her brother goes
          away and dwells in his wife's home, inheriting nothing from his
          parents.<a id="noteref_539" name="noteref_539" href=

          a system could not fail in time to prove irksome. Men would be loth
          to quit the old home, resign the ancestral property to a stranger,
          and go out to seek their fortune empty-handed in the world. The
          remedy was obvious. A man had nothing to do but to marry his sister
          himself instead of handing her over to another. Having done so he
          stayed at home and enjoyed the family estate in virtue of his
          marriage with the heiress. This simple and perfectly effective
          expedient for keeping the property in the <span class="tei tei-pb"

          story-teller's fancy: it reflected a social custom which was itself
          based on practical considerations of the most solid kind. When we
          reflect that this practice of mother-kin as opposed to father-kin
          survived down to the latest times of antiquity, not in an obscure
          and barbarous tribe, but in a nation whose immemorial civilization
          was its glory and the wonder of the world, we may without being
          extravagant suppose that a similar practice formerly prevailed in
          Syria and Phrygia, and that it accounts for the superiority of the
          goddess over the god in the divine partnerships of Adonis and
          Astarte, of Attis and Cybele. But the ancient system both of
          society and of religion had undergone far more change in these
          countries than in Egypt, where to the last the main outlines of the
          old structure could be traced in the national institutions to which
          the Egyptians clung with a passionate, a fanatical devotion.
          Mother-kin, the divinity of kings and queens, a sense of the
          original connexion of the gods with nature—these things outlived
          the Persian, the Macedonian, the Roman conquest, and only perished
          under the more powerful solvent of Christianity. But the old order
          did not vanish at once with the official establishment of the new
          religion. In the age of Constantine the Greeks of Egypt still
          attributed the rise of the Nile to Serapis, the later form of
          Osiris, alleging <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg

          that the inundation could not take place if the standard cubit,
          which was used to measure it, were not deposited according to
          custom in the temple of the god. The emperor ordered the cubit to
          be transferred to a church; and next year, to the general surprise,
          the river rose just as usual.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541"

          the last stronghold of the heathen in Egypt. It perished in a
          furious and bloody sedition, in which Christians and pagans seem to
          have vied with each other in mutual atrocities. After its fall the
          temples were levelled with the ground or converted into churches,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The singular
          tenacity with which the Egyptian people maintained their
          traditional beliefs and customs for thousands of years sprang no
          doubt from the stubborn conservatism of the national character. Yet
          that conservatism was itself in great measure an effect of
          geographical and climatic conditions and of the ways of life which
          they favoured. Surrounded on every side by deserts or almost
          harbourless seas, the Egyptians occupied a position of great
          natural strength which for long ages together protected them from
          invasion and allowed their native habits to set and harden,
          undisturbed by the subversive influence of foreign conquest. The
          wonderful regularity of nature in Egypt also conduced to a
          corresponding stability in the minds of the people. Year in, year
          out, the immutable succession of the seasons brought with it the
          same unvarying round of agricultural toil. What the fathers had
          done, the sons did in the same manner at the same season, and so it
          went on from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
          218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          generation to generation. This monotonous routine is common indeed
          to all purely agricultural communities, and everywhere tends to
          beget in the husbandman a settled phlegmatic habit of mind very
          different from the mobility, the alertness, the pliability of
          character which the hazards and uncertainties of commerce and the
          sea foster in the merchant and the sailor. The saturnine
          temperament of the farmer is as naturally averse to change as the

          further in Egypt than in most lands devoted to husbandry by reason

          functions which he was expected to discharge for the good of his

          we read that one of them, Aun or On by name, sacrificed nine of his
          sons to Odin at Upsala in order that his own life might be spared.
          After the sacrifice of his second son he received from the god an
          oracle that he should live as long as he gave him one of his sons
          every tenth year. When he had thus sacrificed seven sons, the
          ruthless father still lived, but was so feeble that he could no
          longer walk and had to be carried in a chair. Then he offered up
          his eighth son and lived ten years more, bedridden. After that he
          sacrificed his ninth son, and lived ten years more, drinking out of
          a horn like a weaned child. He now wished to sacrifice his last
          remaining son to Odin, but the Swedes would not let him, so he died
          and was buried in a mound at Upsala.<a id="noteref_550" name=

          this Swedish tradition the king's children seem to have been looked
          upon as substitutes offered to the god in place of their father,
          and apparently this was also the current explanation of the
          slaughter of the first-born in the later times of Israel.<a id=

          that view the sacrifices were vicarious, and therefore purely
          religious, being intended to propitiate a stern and exacting deity.
          Similarly we read that when Amestris, wife of Xerxes, was grown
          old, she sacrificed on her behalf twice seven noble children to the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> If
          the story is true—and it rests on the authority of Herodotus, a
          nearly contemporary witness—we may surmise that the aged queen
          acted thus with an eye to the future rather than to the past; she
          hoped that the grim god of the nether-world would accept the young
          victims in her stead, and let her live for many years. The same
          idea of vicarious suffering comes out in a tradition told of a
          certain Hova king of Madagascar, who bore the sonorous name of
          Andriamasinavalona. When he had grown sickly and feeble, the oracle
          was consulted as to the best way of restoring him to health.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The following result was the consequence
          of the directions of the oracle. A speech was first delivered to
          the people, offering great honours and rewards to the family of any
          individual who would freely offer himself to be sacrificed, in
          order to the king's recovery. The people shuddered at the idea, and
          ran away in different directions. One man, however, presented
          himself for the purpose, and his offer was accepted. The sacrificer
          girded up his loins, sharpened his knife, and bound the victim.
          After which, he was laid down with his head towards the east, upon
          a mat spread for the purpose, according to the custom with animals
          on such occasions, when the priest appeared, to proceed with all
          solemnity in slaughtering the victim by cutting his throat. A
          quantity of red liquid, however, which had been prepared from a
          native dye, was spilled in the ceremony; and, to the amazement of
          those who looked on, blood seemed to be flowing all around. The
          man, as might be supposed, was unhurt; but the king rewarded him
          and his descendants with the perpetual privilege of exemption from
          capital punishment for any violation of the laws. The descendants
          of the man to this day form a particular class, called <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Tay maty
          manota</span></span>, which may be translated, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘Not dead, though transgressing.’</span> Instances
          frequently occur, of individuals of this class appropriating
          bullocks, rice, and other things belonging to the sovereign, as if
          they were their own, and escaping merely with a reprimand, while a
          common person would have to suffer death, or be reduced to
          slavery.”</span><a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes,
          however, the practices intended to prolong the king's life seem to
          rest on a theory of nutrition rather than of substitution; in other
          words, the life of the victims, instead of being offered
          vicariously to a god, is apparently supposed to pass directly into
          the body of the sacrificer, thus refreshing his failing strength
          and prolonging his existence. So regarded, the custom is magical
          rather than religious in character, since the desired effect is
          thought to follow directly without the intervention of a deity. At
          all events, it can be shown that sacrifices of this sort have been
          offered to prolong the life of kings in other parts of the world.
          Thus in regard to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg
          222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          some of the negroes who inhabit the delta of the Niger we read
          that: <span class="tei tei-q">“A custom which formerly was
          practised by the Ibani, and is still prevalent among all the
          interior tribes, consists in prolonging the life of a king or
          ancestral representative by the daily, or possibly weekly,
          sacrifice of a chicken and egg. Every morning, as soon as the
          patriarch has risen from his bed, the sacrificial articles are
          procured either by his mother, head wife, or eldest daughter, and
          given to the priest, who receives them on the open space in front
          of the house. When this has been reported to the patriarch, he
          comes outside and, sitting down, joins in the ceremony. Taking the
          chicken in his hand, the priest first of all touches the
          patriarch's face with it, and afterwards passes it over the whole
          of his body. He then cuts its throat and allows the blood to drop
          on the ground. Mixing the blood and the earth into a paste, he rubs
          it on the old man's forehead and breast, and this is not to be
          washed off under any circumstances until the evening. The chicken
          and the egg, also a piece of white cloth, are now tied on to a
          stick, which, if a stream is in the near vicinity, is planted in
          the ground at the water-side. During the carriage of these articles
          to the place in question, all the wives and many members of the
          household accompany the priest, invoking the deity as they go to
          prolong their father's life. This is done in the firm conviction
          that through the sacrifice of each chicken his life will be
          accordingly prolonged.”</span><a id="noteref_554" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ceremony
          thus described is, like so many other rites, a combination of magic

          passing of the victim over the king's body and the smearing of him
          with its blood are magical, being plainly intended to convey to him
          directly, without the mediation of any deity, the life of the fowl.
          In the following instances the practices for prolonging the king's
          life seem to be purely magical. Among the Zulus, at one of the
          annual feasts of first-fruits, a bull is killed by a particular
          regiment. In slaughtering the beast they may not use spears or
          sticks, but must break its neck or choke it with their bare hands.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“It is then burned, and the strength of the
          bull is supposed to enter into the king, thereby prolonging his

          Again, in an early Portuguese historian we read of a Caffre king of
          East Africa that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is related of this
          Monomotapa that he has a house where he commands bodies of men who

          of their bodies falls into vases placed underneath, and when all
          has dropped from them and they shrink and dry up he commands them
          to be taken down and buried, and with the fat and moisture in the
          vases they say he makes ointments with which he anoints himself in
          order to enjoy long life—which is his belief—and also to be proof

          Central Africa used to kill men on various occasions for the
          purpose of prolonging the king's life; in all cases it would seem
          to be thought that the life of the murdered man was in some
          mysterious fashion transferred to the king, so that the monarch
          received thereby a fresh accession of vital energy. For example,
          whenever a particular royal drum had a new skin put on it, not only
          was a cow killed to furnish the skin and its blood run into the
          drum, but a man was beheaded and the spouting blood from the
          severed neck was allowed to gush into the drum, <span class=

          Again, at the coronation of a new king, a royal chamberlain was
          chosen to take charge of the king's inner court and to guard his
          wives. From the royal presence the chamberlain was conducted, along
          with eight captives, to one of the human shambles; there he was
          blindfolded while seven of the men were clubbed to death, only the
          dull thud and crashing sound telling him of what was taking place.
          But when the seven had been thus despatched, the bandages were
          removed from the chamberlain's eyes and he witnessed the death of
          the eighth. As each man was killed, his belly was ripped open and
          his bowels pulled out and hung round the chamberlain's neck. These
          deaths were said to add to the King's vigour and to make the

          reigned two or three months, he was expected to hunt first a
          leopard and then a bushbuck. On the night after the hunt of the
          bushbuck, one of the ministers of State caught a man and brought
          him before the king in the dark; the king speared him slightly,
          then the man was strangled and the body thrown into a papyrus
          swamp, that it might never be found again. Another ceremony
          performed about this time to confirm the king in his kingdom was to
          catch a man, bind him, and bring him before the king, who wounded
          him slightly with a spear. Then the man was put to death. These men
          were killed to invigorate the king.<a id="noteref_559" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a king of
          Uganda had reigned some time, apparently several years, a ceremony
          was performed for the sake of prolonging his life. For this purpose
          the king paid a visit—a fatal visit—to a chief of the Lung-fish
          clan, who bore the title of Nankere and resided in the district of
          Busiro, where the tombs and temples of the kings were situated.
          When the time for the ceremony had been appointed, the chief chose
          one of his own sons, who was to die that the king might live. If
          the chief had no son, a near relation was compelled to serve as a
          substitute. The hapless youth was fed and clothed and treated in
          all respects like a prince, and taken to live in a particular house
          near the place where the king was to lodge for the ceremony. When
          the destined victim had been feasted and guarded for a month, the
          king set out on his progress from the capital. On the way he
          stopped at the temple of the great god Mukasa; there he changed his
          garments, leaving behind him in the temple those which he had been
          wearing. Also he left behind him all his anklets, and did not put
          on any fresh ones, for he was shortly to receive new anklets of a
          remarkable kind. When the king arrived at his destination, the
          chief met him, and the two exchanged a gourd of beer. At this
          interview the king's mother was present to see her son for the last
          time; for from that moment the two were never allowed to look upon
          each other again. The chief addressed the king's mother informing
          her of this final separation; then turning to the king he said,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You are now of age; go and live longer
          than your forefathers.”</span> Then the chief's son was introduced.
          The chief took him by the hand and presented him to the king, who
          passed him on to the body-guard; they led him outside and killed
          him by beating him with their clenched fists. The muscles from the
          back of the body of the murdered youth were removed and made into
          two anklets for the king, and a strip of skin cut from the corpse
          was made into a whip, which was kept in the royal enclosure for
          special feasts. The dead body was thrown on waste land and guarded
          against wild beasts, but not buried.<a id="noteref_560" name=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When that
          ceremony was over, the king departed to go to another chief in
          Busiro; but on the way thither he stopped at a place called Baka
          and sat down under a great tree to play a game of spinning
          fruit-stones. It is a children's game, but it was no child's play
          to the man who ran to fetch the fruit-stones for the king to play
          with; for he was caught and speared to death on the spot for the
          purpose of prolonging the king's life. After the game had been
          played the king with his train passed on and lodged with a certain
          princess till the anklets made from the muscles of the chief's
          murdered son were ready for him to wear; <span class="tei tei-pb"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When all these
          ceremonies were over, the king made a great feast. At this feast a
          priest went about carrying under his mantle the whip that had been
          made from the skin of the murdered young man. As he passed through
          the crowd of merrymakers, he would flick a man here and there with
          the whip, and it was believed that the man on whom the lash lighted
          would be childless and might die, unless he made an offering of
          either nine or ninety cowrie shells to the priest who had struck
          him. Naturally he hastened to procure the shells and take them to
          the striker, who, on receiving them, struck the man on the shoulder
          with his hand, thus restoring to him the generative powers of which
          the blow of the whip had deprived him. At the end of the feast the
          drummers removed all the drums but one, which they left as if they
          had forgotten it. Somebody in the crowd would notice the apparent
          oversight and run after the drummers with the drum, saying,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“You have left one behind.”</span> The
          thanks he received was that he was caught and killed and the bones
          of his upper arm made into drumsticks for that particular drum. The
          drum was never afterwards brought out during the whole of the
          king's reign, but was kept covered up till the time came to bring
          it out on the corresponding feast of his successor. Yet from time
          to time the priest, who had flicked the revellers with the whip of
          human skin, would dress himself up in a mantle of cow-hide from
          neck to foot, and concealing the drumstick of human bones under his
          robe would go into the king's presence, and suddenly whipping out
          the bones from his bosom would brandish them in the king's face.
          Then he would as suddenly hide them again, but only to repeat the
          manoeuvre. After that he retired and restored the bones to their
          usual place. They were decorated with cowrie shells and little
          bells, which jingled as he shook them at the king.<a id=

          </div>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The precise
          meaning of these latter ceremonies is obscure; but we may suppose
          that just as the human blood poured into a drum was thought to pass
          into the king's veins in the booming notes of the drum, so the
          clicking of the human bones and the jingling of their bells were
          supposed to infuse into the royal person the vigour of the murdered
          man. The purpose of flicking commoners with the whip made of human
          skin is even more obscure; but we may conjecture that the life or
          virility of every man struck with the whip was supposed to be
          transmitted in some way to the king, who thus recruited his vital,
          and especially his reproductive, energies at this solemn feast. If
          I am right in my interpretation, all these Baganda <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> modes of strengthening the king and
          prolonging his life belonged to the nutritive rather than to the
          vicarious type of sacrifice, from which it will follow that they
          were magical rather than religious in character.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same thing
          may perhaps be said of the wholesale massacres which used to be
          perpetrated when a king of Uganda was ill. At these times the
          priests informed the royal patient that persons marked by a certain
          physical peculiarity, such as a cast of the eye, a particular gait,
          or a distinctive colouring, must be put to death. Accordingly the
          king sent out his catchpoles, who waylaid such persons in the roads
          and dragged them to the royal enclosure, where they were kept until
          the tale of victims prescribed by the priest was complete. Before
          they were led away to one of the eight places of execution, which
          were regularly appointed for this purpose in different parts of the
          kingdom, the victims had to drink medicated beer with the king out
          of a special pot, in order that he might have power over their
          ghosts, lest they should afterwards come back to torment him. They
          were killed, sometimes by being speared to death, sometimes by
          being hacked to pieces, sometimes by being burned alive. Contrary
          to the usual custom of the Baganda, the bodies, or what remained of
          the bodies, of these unfortunates were always left unburied on the
          place of execution.<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href=

          what way precisely the sick king was supposed to benefit by these
          massacres of his subjects does not appear, but we may surmise that
          somehow the victims were believed to give their lives for him or to
          him.</p>

          substitutes for him or by recruiting his failing energies with
          their vigorous young life. But it is equally possible, and perhaps
          more probable, that the sacrifice of the first-born children was
          only a particular application of the ancient law which devoted to

            been suggested by my friend Dr. L. R. Farnell. He supposes that
            such a bereavement would render the Flamen ceremonially impure,
            and therefore unfit to hold office.<a id="noteref_566" name=
            "noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> It
            is true that the ceremonial pollution caused by death commonly
            disqualifies a man for the discharge of sacred functions, but as
            a rule the disqualification is only temporary and can be removed
            by seclusion and the observance of purificatory rites, the length
            of the seclusion and the nature of the purification varying with
            the degree of relationship in which the living stand to the dead.
            Thus, for example, if one of the sacred eunuchs at
            Hierapolis-Bambyce saw the dead body of a stranger, he was
            unclean for that day and might not enter the sanctuary of the
            goddess; but next day after purifying himself he was free to
            enter. But if the corpse happened to be that of a relation he was
            unclean for thirty days and had to shave his head before he might
            set foot within the holy precinct.<a id="noteref_567" name=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a>
            Again, in the Greek island of Ceos persons who had offered the
            annual sacrifices to their departed friends were unclean for two
            days afterwards and might not enter a sanctuary; they had to
            purify themselves with water.<a id="noteref_568" name=

            Similarly no one might go into the shrine of Men Tyrannus for ten
            days after being in contact with the dead.<a id="noteref_569"

            Once more, at Stratonicea in Caria a chorus of thirty noble boys,
            clad in white and holding branches in their hands, used to sing a
            hymn daily in honour of Zeus and Hecate; but if one of them were
            sick or had suffered a domestic bereavement, he was for the time
            being excused, not permanently excluded, from the <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, in
            support of Dr. Farnell's view I would cite an Indian parallel
            which was pointed out to me by Dr. W. H. R. Rivers. Among the
            Todas of the Neilgherry Hills in Southern India the priestly
            dairyman (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">palol</span></span>) is a sacred personage,
            and his life, like that of the Flamen Dialis, is hedged in by
            many taboos. Now when a death occurs in his clan, the dairyman
            may not attend any of the funeral ceremonies unless he gives up
            office, but he may be re-elected after the second funeral
            ceremonies have been completed. In the interval his place must be
            taken by a man of another clan. Some eighteen or nineteen years
            ago a man named Karkievan resigned the office of dairyman when
            his wife died, but two years later he was re-elected and has held
            office ever since. There have meantime been many deaths in his
            clan, but he has not attended a funeral, and has not therefore
            had to resign his post again. Apparently in old times a more
            stringent rule prevailed, and the dairyman was obliged to vacate
            office whenever a death occurred in his clan. For, according to
            tradition, the clan of Keadrol was divided into its two existing
            divisions for the express purpose of ensuring that there might
            still be men to undertake the office of dairyman when a death
            occurred in the clan, the men of the one division taking office
            whenever there was a death in the other.<a id="noteref_571" name=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first sight
            this case may seem exactly parallel to the case of the Flamen
            Dialis and the Flaminica on Dr. Farnell's theory; for here there
            can be no doubt whatever that it is the pollution of death which
            disqualifies the sacred dairyman from holding office, since, if
            he only avoids that pollution by not attending the funeral, he is
            allowed at the present day to retain his post. On this analogy we
            might suppose that it was not so much the death of his wife as
            the attendance at her funeral which compelled the Flamen Dialis
            to resign, especially as we know that he was expressly forbidden
            to touch a dead body or to enter the place where corpses were
            burned.<a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a closer
            inspection of the facts proves that the analogy breaks down at
            some important points. For though the Flamen Dialis was forbidden
            to touch a dead body or to enter a place where corpses were
            burned, he was permitted to attend a funeral;<a id="noteref_573"
            name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a> so
            that there could hardly be any objection to his attending the
            funeral of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg
            229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            his wife. This permission clearly tells against the view that it
            was the mere pollution of death which obliged him to resign
            office when his wife died. Further, and this is a point of
            fundamental difference between the two cases, whereas the Flamen
            Dialis was bound to be married, and married too by a rite of
            special solemnity,<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href=
            "#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a>
            there is no such obligation on the sacred dairyman of the Todas;
            indeed, if he is married, he is bound to live apart from his wife
            during his term of office.<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575"
            href="#note_575"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">575</span></span></a>
            Surely the obligation laid on the Flamen Dialis to be married of
            itself implies that with the death of his wife he necessarily
            ceased to hold office: there is no need to search for another
            reason in the pollution of death which, as I have just shown,
            does not seem to square with the permission granted to the Flamen
            to attend a funeral. That this is indeed the true explanation of
            the rule in question is strongly suggested by the further and
            apparently parallel rule which forbade the Flamen to divorce his
            wife; nothing but death might part them.<a id="noteref_576" name=
            "noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a> Now
            the rule which enjoined that a Flamen must be married, and the
            rule which forbade him to divorce his wife, have obviously
            nothing to do with the pollution of death, yet they can hardly be
            separated from the other rule that with the death of his wife he
            vacated office. All three rules are explained in the most natural
            way on the hypothesis which I have adopted, namely, that this
            married priest and priestess had to perform in common certain
            rites which the husband could not perform without his wife. The
            same obvious solution of the problem was suggested long ago by
            Plutarch, who, after asking why the Flamen Dialis had to lay down
            office on the death of his wife, says, amongst other things, that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“perhaps it is because she performs
            sacred rites along with him (for many of the rites may not be
            performed without the presence of a married woman), and to marry
            another wife immediately <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a>
            This simple explanation of the rule seems quite sufficient, and
            it would clearly hold good whether I am right or wrong in further
            supposing that the human husband and wife in this case
            represented a divine husband and wife, a god and goddess, to wit
            Jupiter and Juno, or rather Dianus (Janus) and Diana;<a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a> and
            that supposition in its turn might still hold good even if I were
            wrong in further conjecturing that of this divine pair the
            goddess (Juno or rather Diana) was originally the more important
            partner.</p>

            he also affirmed generally, in the most unambiguous language,
            that the old Roman gods were married, and in saying so he
            referred not to the religion of his own day, which had been

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, the
            learned Servius, whose commentary on Virgil is a gold mine of
            Roman religious lore, informs us that the pontiffs celebrated the

            solemnity;<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href=

            pontifical books themselves, for he refers to them in the same
            connexion only a few lines before. As it is in the highest degree
            unlikely that the pontiffs would solemnize any foreign rites, we
            may safely assume that the marriage of Orcus was not borrowed
            from Greek mythology, but was a genuine old Roman ceremony, and
            this is all the more probable because Servius, our authority for
            the custom, has recorded some curious and obviously ancient
            taboos which were observed at the marriage and in the ritual of
            Ceres, the goddess who seems to have been joined in wedlock to
            Orcus. One of these taboos forbade the use of wine, the other

            More than that he proves conclusively by quotations from Plautus,
            the annalist Cn. Gellius, and Licinius Imbrex that these old
            writers certainly regarded one at least of the pairs (Mars and

            we have good ancient evidence for viewing in the same light three
            others of the pairs. Thus the old annalist and antiquarian L.
            Cincius Alimentus, who fought against Hannibal and was captured
            by him, affirmed in his work on the Roman calendar that Maia was

            is reasonable to suppose that he was assisted in the ceremony by
            a Flaminica, his wife, just as on my hypothesis the Flamen Dialis
            was assisted by his wife the Flaminica. Another old Roman
            historian, L. Calpurnius Piso, who wrote in the second century
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, said that the name

            saying so he may have intended to correct what he believed to be
            a mistake of his predecessor L. Cincius. Again, that Salacia was
            the wife of Neptune is perhaps implied by Varro,<a id=

            Again, Ennius appears to have regarded Hora as the wife of

            Again, the most famous of all Roman myths represented the founder
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name=
            "Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Rome himself,
            Romulus and his twin brother Remus, as begotten by the god Mars
            on a Vestal Virgin;<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href=

            every Roman who accepted the tradition thereby acknowledged the
            fatherhood of the god in the physical, not in a figurative, sense
            of the word. If the story of the birth of Romulus and Remus
            should be dismissed as a late product of the mythical fancy
            working under Greek influence, the same objection can hardly be
            urged against the story of the birth of another Roman king,
            Servius Tullius, who is said to have been a son of the fire-god
            and a slave woman; his mother conceived him beside the royal
            hearth, where she was impregnated by a flame that shot out from
            the fire in the shape of the male organ of generation.<a id=

            would scarcely be possible to express the physical fatherhood of
            the fire-god in more unambiguous terms. Now a precisely similar
            story was told of the birth of Romulus himself;<a id=
            "noteref_604" name="noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> and
            we may suspect that this was an older form of the story than the
            legend which fathered the twins on Mars. Similarly, Caeculus, the
            founder of Praeneste, passed for a son of the fire-god Vulcan. It
            was said that his mother was impregnated by a spark which leaped
            from the fire and struck her as she sat by the hearth. In later
            life, when Caeculus boasted of his divine parentage to a crowd,
            and they refused to believe him, he prayed to his father to give
            the unbelievers a sign, and straightway a lambent flame
            surrounded the whole multitude. The proof was conclusive, and
            henceforth Caeculus passed for a true son of the fire-god.<a id=
            "noteref_605" name="noteref_605" href="#note_605"><span class=

            Such tales of kings or heroes begotten by the fire-god on mortal
            women appear to be genuine old Italian myths, which may well go
            back far beyond the foundation of Rome to the common fountain of
            Aryan mythology; for the marriage customs observed by various
            branches of the Aryan family point clearly to a belief in the
            power of fire to impregnate women.<a id="noteref_606" name=

            It is true that, compared with the full-blooded gods of Greece,
            the deities of Rome appear to us shadowy creatures, pale
            abstractions garbed in little that can vie with the gorgeous pall
            of myth and story which Grecian fancy threw around its divine

            traditions which have perished. At all events the comparative
            aridity and barrenness of the Roman religious imagination is no
            reason for setting aside the positive testimony of learned Roman
            writers as to a point of fundamental importance in their own
            religion about which they could hardly be mistaken. It should
            never be forgotten that on this subject the ancients had access
            to many sources of information which are no longer open to us,
            and for a modern scholar to reject their evidence in favour of a
            personal impression derived from a necessarily imperfect

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Dr.
            Farnell adduces another argument in support of his view that it
            was the pollution of death which obliged the widowed Flamen
            Dialis to resign the priesthood. He points to what he considers
            the analogy of the rule of Greek ritual which required that
            certain sacred offices should be discharged only by a boy whose
            parents were both alive.<a id="noteref_609" name="noteref_609"

            This rule he would explain in like manner by supposing that the
            death of one or both of his parents would render a boy
            ceremonially impure and therefore unfit to perform religious
            functions. Dr. Farnell might have apparently strengthened his
            case by observing that the Flamen Dialis and the Flaminica Dialis
            were themselves assisted in their office, the one by a boy, the
            other by a girl, both of whose parents must be alive.<a id=

            Flaminica, and their youthful ministers were all rendered
            incapable of performing their sacred duties by the taint or
            corruption of death.</p>

                <span style="font-size: 80%">But the rule which excludes
                orphans from certain sacred offices cannot be based on a

              </div>
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a closer
            scrutiny of the argument reveals a flaw. It proves too much. For
            observe that in these Greek and Roman offices held by boys and
            girls the disqualification caused by the death of a parent is
            necessarily lifelong, since the bereavement is irreparable.
            Accordingly, if Dr. Farnell's theory is right, the ceremonial
            pollution which is the cause of the disqualification must also be
            lifelong; in other words, every orphan is ceremoniously unclean
            for life and thereby excluded for ever from the discharge of
            sacred duties. So sweeping a rule would at a stroke exclude a
            large, if not the larger, part of the population of any country
            from the offices of religion, and lay them permanently under all
            those burdensome restrictions which the pollution of death
            entails among many nations; for obviously a large, if not the
            larger, part of the population of any country at any time has
            lost one or both of its parents by death. No people, so far as I
            know, has ever carried the theory of the ceremonial pollution of
            death to this extremity in practice. And even if it were supposed
            that the taint wore off or evaporated with time from common folk
            so as to let them go about their common duties in everyday life,
            would it not still cleave to priests? If it incapacitated the
            Flamen's minister, would it not incapacitate the Flamen himself?
            In other words, would not the Flamen Dialis be obliged to vacate
            office on the death of his father or mother? There is no hint in
            ancient writers that he had to do so. And while it is generally
            unsafe to argue from the silence of our authorities, I think that
            we may do so in this case without being rash; for Plutarch not
            only mentions but discusses the rule which obliged the Flamen
            Dialis to resign office on the death of his wife,<a id=
            "noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href="#note_611"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a> and
            if he had known of a parallel rule which compelled him to retire
            on the death of a parent, he would surely have mentioned it. But
            if the ceremonial pollution which would certainly be caused by
            the death of a parent did not compel the Flamen Dialis to vacate
            office, we may safely conclude that neither did the similar
            pollution caused by the death of his wife. Thus the argument
            adduced by Dr. Farnell in favour of his view proves on analysis
            to tell strongly against it.</p>

            raced to the sanctuary of Athena Sciras. The winner received and
            drained a cup containing a mixture of olive-oil, wine, honey,

            procession to a temple of Apollo, at the door of which the boy
            deposited the holy bough. The ceremony is said to have been
            instituted by the Athenians in obedience to an oracle for the

            public expense throughout the winter they sacrificed it,
            apparently at harvest-time, in the following summer. Nine boys
            and nine girls, whose fathers and mothers were all living, took
            part in the religious services of the consecration and the
            sacrifice of the bull. At the consecration public prayers were
            offered for the safety of the city and the land, for the safety
            of the citizens and their wives and children, for the safety of
            all that dwelt in the city and the land, for peace and wealth and
            abundance of corn and all other fruits, and for the cattle. A
            herald led the prayers, and the priest and priestess, the boys
            and girls, the high officers and magistrates, all <span class=

            Among the Karo-Bataks of Central Sumatra the threshing of the
            rice is the occasion of various ceremonies, and in these a
            prominent part is played by a girl, whose father and mother must
            be both alive. Her special duty is to take care of the sheaf of
            rice in which the soul of the rice is believed to reside. This
            sheaf usually consists of the first rice cut and bound in the
            field; it is treated exactly like a person.<a id="noteref_616"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rites thus
            far described, in which boys and girls of living parents took
            part, were clearly ceremonies intended specially to ensure the
            fertility of the soil. This is indicated not merely by the nature
            of the rites and of the prayers or verses which accompanied them,
            but also by the seasons at which they were observed; for these
            were the vintage, the harvest-home, and the beginning of sowing.
            We may therefore compare a custom practised by the Roman Brethren
            of the Ploughed Fields (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
            xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Fratres
            Arvales</span></span>), a college of priests whose business it
            was to perform the rites deemed necessary for the growth of the
            corn. As a badge of office they wore wreaths of corn-ears, and
            paid their devotions to an antique goddess of fertility, the Dea
            Dia. Her home was in a grove of ancient evergreen oaks and
            laurels out in the Campagna, five miles from Rome. Hither every
            year in the month of May, when the fields were ripe or ripening
            to the sickle, reaped ears of the new corn were brought and
            hallowed by the Brethren with quaint rites, that a blessing might
            rest on the coming harvest. The first or preliminary consecration
            of the ears, however, took place, not in the grove, but in the
            house of the Master of the Brethren at Rome. Here the Brethren
            were waited upon by four free-born boys, the children of living
            fathers and mothers. While the Brethren reclined on couches, the
            boys were allowed to sit on chairs and partake of the feast, and
            when it was over they carried the rest of the now hallowed corn
            and laid it on the altar.<a id="noteref_617" name="noteref_617"

            Delphi every eighth year a sacred drama or miracle-play was acted
            which drew crowds of spectators from all parts of Greece. It set
            forth the slaying of the Dragon by Apollo. The principal part was
            sustained by a lad, the son of living parents, who seems to have
            personated the god himself. In an open space the likeness of a
            lordly palace, erected for the occasion, represented the Dragon's
            den. It was attacked and burned by the lad, aided by women who
            carried blazing torches. When the Dragon had received his deadly
            wound, the lad, still acting the part of the god, fled far away
            to be purged of the guilt of blood in the beautiful Vale of
            Tempe, where the Peneus flows in a deep wooded gorge between the
            snowy peaks of Olympus and Ossa, its smooth and silent tide
            shadowed by overhanging trees and tall white cliffs. In places
            these great crags rise abruptly from the stream and approach each
            other so near that only a narrow strip of sky is visible
            overhead; but where they recede a little, the meadows at their
            foot are verdant with evergreen shrubs, among which Apollo's own
            laurel may still be seen. In antiquity the god himself, stained
            with the Dragon's blood, is said to have come, a haggard footsore
            wayfarer, to this wild secluded glen and there plucked branches
            from one of the laurels that grew in its green thickets beside
            the rippling river. Some of them he used to twine a wreath for
            his brows, one of them he carried in his hand, doubtless in order
            that, guarded by the sacred plant, he might escape the hobgoblins
            which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg
            241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            dogged his steps. So the boy, his human representative, did the
            same, and brought back to Delphi wreaths of laurel from the same
            tree to be awarded to the victors in the Pythian games. Hence the
            whole festival of the Slaying of the Dragon at Delphi went by the
            name of the Festival of Crowning.<a id="noteref_620" name=

            From this it appears that at Delphi as well as at Olympia the
            boughs which were used to crown the victors had to be cut from a
            sacred tree by a boy whose parents must be both alive.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Thebes a
            festival called the Laurel-bearing was held once in every eight
            years, when branches of laurel were carried in procession to the
            temple of Apollo. The principal part in the procession was taken
            by a boy who held a laurel bough and bore the title of the
            Laurel-bearer: he seems to have personated the god himself. His
            hair hung down on his shoulders, and he wore a golden crown, a
            bright-coloured robe, and shoes of a special shape: both his
            parents must be alive.<a id="noteref_621" name="noteref_621"
            href="#note_621"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> We
            may suppose that the golden crown which he wore was fashioned in
            the shape of laurel leaves and replaced a wreath of real laurel.
            Thus the boy with the laurel wreath on his head and the laurel
            bough in his hand would resemble the traditional equipment of
            Apollo when he purified himself for the slaughter of the dragon.
            We may conjecture that at Thebes the Laurel-bearer originally
            personated not Apollo but the local hero Cadmus, who slew the
            dragon and had like Apollo to purify himself for the slaughter.
            The conjecture is confirmed by vase-paintings which represent
            Cadmus crowned with laurel preparing to attack the dragon or
            actually in combat with the monster, while goddesses bend over
            him holding out wreaths of laurel as the meed of victory.<a id=

            this hypothesis the octennial Delphic Festival of Crowning and
            the octennial Theban Festival of Laurel-bearing were closely
            akin: in both the prominent part played by the laurel was
            purificatory or expiatory.<a id="noteref_623" name="noteref_623"

            entrusted with the duty of cutting or wearing a sacred wreath at

            first sight clear; the reason might be more obvious if we
            understood the ideas in which the custom of wearing wreaths and
            crowns had its origin. Probably in many cases wreaths and crowns
            were amulets before they were ornaments; in other words, their
            first intention may have been not so much to adorn the head as to
            protect it from harm by surrounding it with a plant, a metal, or
            any other thing which was supposed to possess the magical virtue
            of banning baleful influences. Thus the Arabs of Moab will put a
            circlet of copper on the head of a man who is suffering from
            headache, for they believe that this will banish the pain; and if
            the pain is in an arm or a leg, they will treat the ailing limb
            in like manner. They think that red beads hung before the eyes of
            children who are afflicted with ophthalmia will rid them of the
            malady, and that a red ribbon tied to the foot will prevent it
            from stumbling on a stony path.<a id="noteref_625" name=

            Again, the Melanesians of the Gazelle Peninsula in New Britain
            often deck their dusky bodies with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> flowers, leaves, and scented herbs not only
            at festivals but on other occasions which to the European might
            seem inappropriate for such gay ornaments. But in truth the
            bright blossoms and verdant foliage are not intended to decorate
            the wearer but to endow him with certain magical virtues, which
            are supposed to inhere in the flowers and leaves. Thus one man
            may be seen strutting about with a wreath of greenery which
            passes round his neck and droops over his shoulders, back, and
            breast. He is not a mere dandy, but a lover who hopes that the
            wreath will work as a charm on a woman's heart. Again, another
            may be observed with a bunch of the red dracaena leaves knotted
            round his neck and the long stalk hanging down his back. He is a
            soldier, and these leaves are supposed to make him invulnerable.
            But if the lover should fail to win the affections of his swarthy
            mistress, if the warrior should be wounded in battle, it never
            occurs to either of them to question the magical virtue of the
            charm; they ascribe the failure either to the more potent charm
            of another magician or to some oversight on their own part.<a id=
            "noteref_626" name="noteref_626" href="#note_626"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">626</span></span></a> On
            the theory that wreaths and garlands serve as amulets to protect
            the wearer against the powers of evil we can understand not only
            why in antiquity sacred persons such as priests and kings wore
            crowns, but also why dead bodies, sacrificial victims, and in
            certain circumstances even inanimate objects such as the
            implements of sacrifice, the doors of houses, and so forth, were
            decorated or rather guarded by wreaths.<a id="noteref_627" name=

            Further, on this hypothesis we may perhaps perceive why children
            of living parents were specially chosen to cut or wear sacred
            wreaths. Since such children were apparently supposed to be
            endowed with a more than common share of vital energy, they might
            be deemed peculiarly fitted to make or wear amulets which were
            designed to protect the wearer from injury and death: the current
            of life which circulated in their own veins overflowed, as it
            were, and reinforced the magic virtue of the wreath. For the same
            reason such children would naturally be chosen to personate gods,
            as they seemingly were at Delphi and Thebes.</p>

            there is no evidence or probability that a Vestal vacated office
            on the death of a parent; indeed she generally held office for
            life.<a id="noteref_630" name="noteref_630" href=

            This alone may suffice to prove that the custom of entrusting
            certain sacred duties to children of living parents was not based
            on any notion that orphans as such were ceremonially unclean.
            Again, the dancing priests of Mars, the Salii, must be sons of
            living parents;<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href=

            as in the case of the Vestals this condition probably only
            applied at the date of their election, for they seem like the
            Vestals to have held office for life. At all events we read of a
            lively old gentleman who still skipped and capered about as a
            dancing priest with an agility which threw the efforts of his
            younger colleagues into the shade.<a id="noteref_632" name=

            Again, at the public games in Rome boys of living parents had to
            escort the images of the gods in their sacred cars, and it was a
            dire omen if one of them relaxed his hold on the holy cart or let
            a strap slip from his fingers.<a id="noteref_633" name=

            when the stout Roman heart was shaken by the appalling news that
            somebody had been struck by lightning, that the sky had somewhere
            been suddenly overcast, or that a she-mule had been safely
            delivered of a colt, boys and girls whose fathers and mothers
            were still alive used to be sought out and employed to help in
            expiating the terrific prodigy.<a id="noteref_634" name=

            Again, when the Capitol had been sacked and burned by the
            disorderly troops of Vitellius, solemn preparations were made to
            rebuild it. The whole area was enclosed by a cordon of fillets
            and wreaths. Then soldiers chosen for their auspicious names
            entered within the barriers holding branches of lucky trees in
            their hands; and afterwards the Vestal Virgins, aided by boys and
            girls of living parents, washed the foundations with water drawn
            from springs and rivers.<a id="noteref_635" name="noteref_635"

            this ceremony the choice of such children seems to be based on
            the same idea as the choice of such water; for as running water
            is deemed to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg

            the vital current might be thought to flow without interruption
            in the children of living parents but to stagnate in orphans.
            Hence the children of living parents rather than orphans would
            naturally be chosen to pour the living water over the
            foundations, and so to lend something of their own vitality or
            endurance to a building that was designed to last for ever.</p>

            parents should be especially chosen to perform certain offices at

            sympathetic magic the life of the newly wedded pair and of their
            offspring. Thus at Roman marriages the bride was escorted to her
            new home by three boys whose parents were all living. Two of the
            boys held her, and the third carried a torch of buckthorn or

            probably for the purpose of averting the powers of evil; for
            buckthorn or hawthorn was credited with this magical
            virtue.<a id="noteref_638" name="noteref_638" href=

            modern Greece on the Sunday before a marriage the bridegroom
            sends to the bride the wedding cake by the hands of a boy, both
            of whose parents must be living. The messenger takes great care
            not to stumble or to injure the cake, for to do either would be a
            very bad omen. He may not enter the bride's house till she has
            taken the cake from him. For this purpose he lays it down on the
            threshold of the door, and then both of them, the boy and the
            bride, rush at it and try to seize the greater part of the cake.
            And when cattle are being slaughtered for the marriage
            festivities, the first beast killed for the bride's house must be
            killed by a youth whose parents are both alive. Further, a son of
            living parents must solemnly fetch the water with which the
            bridegroom's head is ceremonially washed by women before
            marriage. And on the day after the marriage bride and bridegroom
            go in procession to the well or spring from which they are
            henceforth to fetch their water. The bride greets the spring,
            drinks of the water from the hollow of her hand, and throws money
            and food into it. Then follows a dance, accompanied by a song,
            round about the spring. Lastly, a lad whose parents are both
            living draws water from the spring in a special vessel and
            carries it to the house of the bridal pair without speaking a
            word: this <span class="tei tei-q">“unspoken water,”</span> as it
            is called, is regarded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg
            246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            as peculiarly holy and wholesome. When the young couple return
            from the spring, they fill their mouths with the <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“unspoken water”</span> and try to spirt it on each
            other inside the door of the house.<a id="noteref_640" name=

            Albania, when women are baking cakes for a wedding, the first to
            put hand to the dough must be a maiden whose parents are both
            alive and who has brothers, the more the better; for only such a
            girl is deemed lucky. And when the bride has dismounted from her
            horse at the bridegroom's door, a small boy whose parents are
            both alive (for only such a boy is thought to bring luck) is
            passed thrice backwards and forwards under the horse's belly, as
            if he would girdle the beast.<a id="noteref_641" name=

            Among the South Slavs of Bulgaria a little child whose father and
            mother are both alive helps to bake the two bridal cakes, pouring
            water and salt on the meal and stirring the mixture with a
            spurtle of a special shape; then a girl lifts the child in her
            arms, and the little one touches the roof-beam thrice with the
            spurtle, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys and girls.”</span>
            And when the bride's hair is to be dressed for the wedding day,
            the work of combing and plaiting it must be begun by a child of
            living parents.<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href=

            Among the Eesa and Gadabursi, two Somali tribes, on the morning
            after a marriage <span class="tei tei-q">“the bride's female
            relations bring presents of milk, and are accompanied by a young
            male child whose parents are living. The child drinks some of the
            milk before any one else tastes it; and after him the bridegroom,
            if his parents are living; but if one or both of his parents are
            dead, and those of the bride living, she drinks after the child.
            By doing this they believe that if the newly-married woman bears
            a child the father will be alive at the time.”</span><a id=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> A
            slightly different application of the same principle appears in
            the old Hindoo rule that when a bride reached the house of her
            husband, she should be made to descend from the chariot by women
            of good character whose husbands and sons were living, and that
            afterwards these women should seat the bride on a bull's hide,
            while her husband recited the verse, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Here ye cows, bring forth calves.”</span><a id=

            Here the ceremony of seating the young wife on a bull's hide
            seems plainly intended to make her fruitful through the
            generative virtue of the bull; while the attendance of women,
            whose husbands and sons are living, is no doubt a device for
            ensuring, by sympathetic magic, the life both of the bride's
            husband and of her future offspring.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Somali
            custom just described the part played by the child of living
            parents is unambiguous and helps to throw light on the obscurer
            cases which precede. Such a child is clearly supposed to impart
            the virtue of longevity to the milk of which it partakes, and so
            to transmit it to the newly married pair who afterwards drink of
            the milk. Similarly, we may suppose that in all marriage rites at
            least, if not in religious rites generally, the employment of
            children of living parents is intended to diffuse by sympathy the
            blessings of life and longevity among all who participate in the
            ceremonies. This intention seems to underlie the use which the
            Malagasy make of the children of living parents in ritual. Thus,
            when a child is a week old, it is dressed up in the finest
            clothes that can be got, and is then carried out of the house by
            some person whose parents are both still living; afterwards it is
            brought back to the mother. In the act of being carried out and
            in, the infant must be twice carefully lifted over the fire,
            which is placed near the door. If the child is a boy, the axe,
            knife, and spear of the family, together with any building tools
            that may be in the house, are taken out of it at the same time.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The implements are perhaps used chiefly
            as emblems of the occupations in which it is expected the infant
            will engage when it arrives at maturer years; and the whole may
            be regarded as expressing the hopes cherished of his activity,
            wealth, and enjoyments.”</span><a id="noteref_645" name=

            such an occasion the service of a person whose parents are both
            alive seems naturally calculated to promote the longevity of the
            infant. For a like reason, probably, the holy water used at the
            Malagasy ceremony of circumcision is drawn from a pool by a
            person whose parents are both still living.<a id="noteref_646"

            same idea may explain a funeral custom observed by the Sihanaka
            of Madagascar. After a burial the family of the deceased, with
            their near relatives and dependents, meet in the house from which
            the corpse was lately removed <span class="tei tei-q">“to drink

            Here a person whose parents are both living appears to be
            credited with a more than common share of life and longevity;
            from which it naturally follows that he is better fitted than any
            one else to perform a ceremony intended to avert the danger of
            death from the household.</p>

            and overflowing vitality may easily dissolve into a vague idea
            that the child of living parents is luckier than other folk. No
            more than this seems to be at the bottom of the Masai rule that

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a> may
          perhaps be illustrated by a South African custom. When the
          Bechuanas are about to found a new town, they observe an elaborate
          ritual. They choose a bull from the herd, sew up its eyelids with
          sinew, and then allow the blinded animal to wander at will for four
          days. On the fifth day they track it down and sacrifice it at
          sunset on the spot where it happens to be standing. The carcase is
          then roasted whole and divided among the people. Ritual requires
          that every particle of the flesh should be consumed on the spot.
          When the sacrificial meal is over, the medicine-men take the hide
          and mark it with appropriate medicines, the composition of which is
          a professional secret. Then with one long spiral cut they convert
          the whole hide into a single thong. Having done so they cut up the
          thong into lengths of about two feet and despatch messengers in all
          directions to peg down one of those strips in each of the paths
          leading to the new town. <span class="tei tei-q">“After
          this,”</span> it is said, <span class="tei tei-q">“if a foreigner
          approaches the new town to destroy it with his charms, he will find
          that the town has prepared itself for his coming.”</span><a id=

          distributing pieces of its hide at all points where an enemy could
          approach it, just as the Lydian king thought to place the citadel
          of his capital under the protection of the lion-god by carrying the
          animal round the boundaries.</p>

          proceeded to cut the hide into thongs and to claim as much land as

          the most familiar example of such stories is the tradition that
          Dido procured the site of Carthage in this fashion, and that the
          place hence received the name of Byrsa or <span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">658</span></span></a> The
          wide diffusion of such stories confirms the conjecture of Jacob
          Grimm that in them we have a reminiscence of a mode of land
          measurement which was once actually in use, and of which the
          designation is still retained in the English <em class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a> The
          Bechuana custom suggests that the mode of measuring by a hide may
          have originated in a practice of encompassing a piece of land with
          thongs cut from the hide of a sacrificial victim in order to place
          the ground under the guardianship of the sacred animal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But why do the
          Bechuanas sew up the eyelids of the bull which is to be used for
          this purpose? The answer appears to be given by the ceremonies
          which the same people observe when they are going out to war. On
          that occasion a woman rushes up to the army with her eyes shut and
          shakes a winnowing-fan, while she cries out, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The army is not seen! The army is not seen!”</span>
          And a medicine-man at the same time sprinkles medicine over the
          spears, crying out in like manner, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          army is not seen! The army is not seen!”</span> After that they
          seize a bull, sew up its eyelids with a hair of its tail, and drive
          it for some distance along the road which the army is to take. When
          it has preceded the army a little way, the bull is sacrificed,
          roasted whole, and eaten by the warriors. All the flesh must be
          consumed on the spot. Such parts as cannot be eaten are burnt with
          fire. Only the contents of the stomach are carefully preserved
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name=
          "Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as a charm which is
          to lead the warriors to victory. Chosen men carry the precious guts
          in front of the army, and it is deemed most important that no one
          should precede them. When they stop, the army stops, and it will
          not resume the march till it sees that the men with the bull's guts
          have gone forward.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href=
          "#note_660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">660</span></span></a> The
          meaning of these ceremonies is explained by the cries of the woman
          and the priest, <span class="tei tei-q">“The army is not seen! The
          army is not seen!”</span> Clearly it is desirable that the army
          should not be perceived by the enemies until it is upon them.
          Accordingly on the principles of homoeopathic magic the Bechuanas
          apparently imagine that they can make themselves invisible by
          eating of the flesh of a blind bull, blindness and invisibility
          being to their simple minds the same thing. For the same reason the
          bowels of the blind ox are carried in front of the army to hide its
          advance from hostile eyes. In like manner the custom of sacrificing
          and eating a blind ox on the place where a new town is to be built
          may be intended to render the town invisible to enemies. At all
          events the Bawenda, a South African people who belong to the same
          Bantu stock as the Bechuanas, take great pains to conceal their
          kraals from passers-by. The kraals are built in the forest or bush,
          and the long winding footpaths which lead to them are often kept
          open only by the support of a single pole here and there. Indeed
          the paths are so low and narrow that it is very difficult to bring
          a horse into such a village. In time of war the poles are removed
          and the thorny creepers fall down, forming a natural screen or
          bulwark which the enemy can neither penetrate nor destroy by fire.
          The kraals are also surrounded by walls of undressed stones with a
          filling of soil; and to hide them still better from the view of the
          enemy the tops of the walls are sown with Indian corn or planted
          with tobacco. Hence travellers passing through the country seldom
          come across a Bawenda kraal. To see where the Bawenda dwell you
          must climb to the tops of mountains and look down on the roofs of
          their round huts peeping out of the surrounding green like clusters
          of mushrooms in the woods.<a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661"
          href="#note_661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a> The
          object which the Bawenda attain by these perfectly rational means,
          the Bechuanas seek to compass by the sacrifice and consumption of a
          blind bull.</p>

          Bechuanas and other Caffre tribes of South Africa kill a black ox

          ham-string, and a piece of the principal sinew of the <span class=

          certain herbs and rubbed into the joints of the warriors. By
          cutting out the tongue of the ox they think to prevent the enemy
          from wagging his tongue against them; by severing the sinews of the
          ox they hope to cause the enemy's sinews to fail him in the battle;
          and by removing the eye of the ox they imagine that they prevent
          the enemy from casting a covetous eye on their cattle.<a id=

            their hair long and assimilating themselves to women; even their
            spiritual chiefs, the so-called Maharajas, sometimes simulate the
            appearance of women when they lead the worship of their
            followers.<a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href=

            must have been much coveted, for the incumbent might not be put

            him justice he appears commonly to have taken full advantage of
            this benefit of clergy. When he died, his fortunate successor
            dissected the body of the deceased Grandmother, extracting his
            heart and other vital organs, and amputating his fingers and

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may
            conjecture that in many of these cases the call to this strange
            form of the religious life came in the shape of a dream or
            vision, in which the dreamer or visionary imagined himself to be
            a woman or to be possessed by a female spirit; for with many
            savage races the disordered fancies of sleep or ecstasy are
            accepted as oracular admonitions which it would be perilous to
            disregard. At all events we are told that a dream or a revelation
            of some sort was the reason which in North America these
            men-women commonly alleged for the life they led; it had been
            thus brought home to them, they said, that their medicine or
            their salvation lay in living as women, and when once they had
            got this notion into their head nothing could drive it out again.
            Many an Indian father attempted by persuasion, by bribes, by
            violence, to deter his son from obeying the mysterious call, but
            all to no purpose.<a id="noteref_673" name="noteref_673" href=

            Among the Sauks, an Indian tribe of North America, these
            effeminate beings were always despised, but sometimes they were
            pitied <span class="tei tei-q">“as labouring under an unfortunate
            destiny which they cannot avoid, being supposed to be impelled to
            this course by a vision from the female spirit that resides in
            the moon.”</span><a id="noteref_674" name="noteref_674" href=

            Similarly the Omahas, another <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> Indian tribe of North America, <span class=

            "font-style: italic">Min-qu-ga</span></span>, are mysterious or
            sacred because they have been affected by the Moon Being. When a
            young Omaha fasted for the first time on reaching puberty, it was
            thought that the Moon Being appeared to him, holding in one hand
            a bow and arrows and in the other a pack strap, such as the
            Indian women use. When the youth tried to grasp the bow and
            arrows the Moon Being crossed his hands very quickly, and if the
            youth was not very careful he seized the pack strap instead of
            the bow and arrows, thereby fixing his lot in after life. In such
            a case he could not help acting the woman, speaking, dressing,
            and working just as Indian women used to do.”</span><a id=

            Among the Ibans or Sea Dyaks of Borneo the highest class of
            sorcerers or medicine-men (<span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">manangs</span></span>) are those who are
            believed to have been transformed into women. Such a man is
            therefore called a <span class="tei tei-q">“changed
            medicine-man”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">manang bali</span></span>) on account of his
            supposed change of sex. The call to transform himself into a
            woman is said to come as a supernatural command thrice repeated
            in dreams; to disregard the command would mean death. Accordingly
            he makes a feast, sacrifices a pig or two to avert evil
            consequences from the tribe, and then assumes the garb of a
            woman. Thenceforth he is treated as a woman and occupies himself
            in feminine pursuits. His chief aim is to copy female manners and
            habits as accurately as possible. He is employed for the same
            purposes as an ordinary medicine-man and his methods are similar,
            but he is paid much higher fees and is often called in when
            others have been unable to effect a cure.<a id="noteref_676"
            name="noteref_676" href="#note_676"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a>
            Similarly among the Chukchees of North-Eastern Asia there are
            shamans or medicine-men who assimilate themselves as far as
            possible to women, and who are believed to be called to this
            vocation by spirits in a dream. The call usually comes at the
            critical age of early youth when the shamanistic inspiration, as
            it is called, first manifests itself. But the call is much
            dreaded by the youthful adepts, and some of them prefer death to
            obedience. There are, however, various stages or degrees of
            transformation. In the first stage the man apes a woman only in
            the manner of braiding and arranging the hair of his head. In the
            second he dons female attire; in the third stage he adopts as far
            as possible the life and characteristics of the female sex. A
            young man who is undergoing this final transformation abandons
            all masculine occupations and manners. He throws away the rifle
            and the lance, the lasso of the reindeer herdsman, and the
            harpoon of the seal-hunter, and betakes himself to the needle and
            the skin-scraper instead. He learns the use of them quickly,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name=
            "Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> because the
            spirits are helping him all the time. Even his pronunciation
            changes from the male to the female mode. At the same time his
            body alters, if not in outward appearance, at least in its
            faculties and forces. He loses masculine strength, fleetness of
            foot, endurance in wrestling, and falls into the debility and
            helplessness of a woman. Even his mental character undergoes a
            change. His old brute courage and fighting spirit are gone; he
            grows shy and bashful before strangers, fond of small talk and of
            dandling little children. In short he becomes a woman with the
            appearance of a man, and as a woman he is often taken to wife by
            another man, with whom he leads a regular married life.
            Extraordinary powers are attributed to such transformed shamans.
            They are supposed to enjoy the special protection of spirits who
            play the part of supernatural husbands to them. Hence they are
            much dreaded even by their colleagues in the profession who
            remain mere men; hence, too, they excel in all branches of magic,
            including ventriloquism.<a id="noteref_677" name="noteref_677"

            Among the Teso of Central Africa medicine-men often dress as
            women and wear feminine ornaments, such as heavy chains of beads
            and shells round their heads and necks.<a id="noteref_678" name=

            arms and shoulders bare; but when she prophesied under the

            need not necessarily have any connexion with the social system of
            mother-kin. Wherever a goddess is revered and the theory of
            inspiration is held, a man may be thought to be possessed by a
            female spirit, whether society be organized on mother-kin or on
            father-kin. Still the chances of such a transformation of sex
            will be greater under mother-kin than under father-kin if, as we
            have found reason to believe, a system of mother-kin is more
            favourable to the development and multiplication of goddesses
            than of gods. It is therefore, perhaps, no mere accident that we
            meet with these effeminate priests in regions like the Pelew
            Islands and Western Asia, where the system of mother-kin either
            actually prevails or has at least left traces of it behind in
            tradition and custom. Such traces, for example, are to be found

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
            religious or superstitious interchange of dress between men and
            women is an obscure and complex problem, and it is unlikely that
            any single solution would apply to all the cases. Probably the
            custom has been practised from many different motives. For
            example, the practice of dressing boys as girls has certainly
            been sometimes adopted to avert the Evil Eye;<a id="noteref_692"

            it is possible that the custom of changing garments at marriage,
            the bridegroom disguising himself as a woman, or the bride
            disguising herself as a man, may have been resorted to for the
            same purpose. Thus in Cos, where the priest of Hercules wore
            female attire, the bridegroom was in like manner dressed as a
            woman when he received his bride.<a id="noteref_693" name=

            Among the Jews of Egypt in the Middle Ages the bride led the
            wedding dance with a helmet on her head and a sword in her hand,
            while the bridegroom adorned himself as a woman and put on female

            to the real bridegroom in somewhat insolent tones, and some mock
            play is indulged in. The real bridegroom is addressed as if he
            was the syce (groom) or gumasta (clerk) of the pseudo-bridegroom,
            and is sometimes treated as a thief, and judgment passed on him
            by the latter.”</span><a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698"

            bridegroom puts on women's ornaments and carries with him an iron
            nut-cutter or dagger to keep off evil spirits.”</span><a id=

            Similarly among the Khangars, a low Hindustani caste of the same
            region, <span class="tei tei-q">“the bridegroom is dressed in a
            yellow gown and overcloth, with trousers of red chintz, red
            shoes, and a marriage crown of date-palm leaves. He has the
            silver ornaments usually worn by women on his neck, as the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">khang-wāri</span></span> or silver ring and
            the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">hamel</span></span> or necklace of rupees.
            In order to avert the evil eye he carries a dagger or
            nut-cracker, and a smudge of lampblack is made on his forehead to
            disfigure him and thus avert the evil eye, which, it is thought,
            would otherwise be too probably attracted by his exquisitely
            beautiful appearance in his wedding garments.”</span><a id=

            These examples render it highly probable that, like the dagger or
            nut-cracker which he holds in his hand, the woman's ornaments
            which he wears are intended to protect the bridegroom against
            demons or the evil eye at this critical moment of his life, the
            protection apparently consisting in a disguise which enables him
            to elude the unwelcome attentions of malignant beings.<a id=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar
            explanation probably accounts for the similar exchange of costume
            between other persons than the bride and bridegroom at marriage.
            For example, after a Bharia wedding, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            girl's mother gets the dress of the boy's father and puts it on,
            together with a false beard and moustaches, and dances holding a
            wooden ladle in one hand and a packet of ashes in the other.
            Every time she approaches the bridegroom's father on her rounds
            she spills some of the ashes over him and occasionally gives him
            a crack on the head with her ladle, these actions being
            accompanied by bursts of laughter from the party and frenzied
            playing by the musicians. When the party reach the bridegroom's
            house on their return, his mother and the other women come out,
            and burn a little mustard and human hair in a lamp, the
            unpleasant smell emitted by these articles being considered
            potent to drive away evil spirits.”</span><a id="noteref_702"

            Again, after a Khangar wedding the father of the bridegroom,
            dressed in women's clothes, dances with the mother of the bride,
            while the two throw turmeric mixed with water on each
            other.<a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href=

            Similarly after a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg
            262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            wedding of the Bharbhunjas, another Hindustani caste of the
            Central Provinces, the bridegroom's father dances before the
            family in women's clothes which have been supplied by the bride's
            father.<a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href=

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a>
            Such disguises and dances may be intended either to protect the
            disguised dancer himself against the evil eye or perhaps rather
            to guard the principal personages of the ceremony, the bride and
            bridegroom, by diverting the attention of demons from them to the
            guiser.<a id="noteref_705" name="noteref_705" href=

            However, when at marriage the bride alone assumes the costume and
            appearance of the other sex, the motive for the disguise may
            perhaps be a notion that on the principle of homoeopathic magic
            she thereby ensures the birth of a male heir. Similarly in Sweden
            there is a popular superstition that <span class="tei tei-q">“on
            the night preceding her nuptials the bride should have a baby-boy
            to sleep with her, in which case her first-born will be a

            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> and
            among the Kabyles, when a bride dismounts from her mule at her
            husband's house, a young lad leaps into the saddle before she
            touches the ground, in order that her first child may be a
            boy.<a id="noteref_707" name="noteref_707" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Be that as it
            may, there is no doubt that the assumption of woman's dress is
            sometimes intended to disguise a man for the purpose of deceiving
            a demon. Thus among the Boloki or Bangala on the Upper Congo a
            man was long afflicted with an internal malady. When all other
            remedies had failed, a witch-doctor informed the sufferer that
            the cause of his trouble was an evil spirit, and that the best
            thing he could do was to go far away where the devil could not
            get at him, and to remain there till he had recovered his health.
            The patient followed the prescription. At dead of night he left
            his house, taking only two of his wives with him and telling no
            one of his destination, lest the demon should hear it and follow
            him. So he went far away from his town, donned a woman's dress,
            and speaking in a woman's voice he pretended to be other than he
            was, in order that the devil should not be able to find him at
            his new address. Strange to say, these sage measures failed to
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name=
            "Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> effect a cure, and
            wearying of exile he at last returned home, where he continued to
            dress and speak as a woman.<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708"

            Again, the Kuki-Lushai of Assam believe that if a man kills an
            enemy or a wild beast, the ghost of the dead man or animal will
            haunt him and drive him mad. The only way of averting this
            catastrophe is to dress up as a woman and pretend to be one. For
            example, a man who had shot a tiger and was in fear of being
            haunted by the animal's ghost, dressed himself up in a woman's
            petticoat and cloth, wore ivory earrings, and wound a mottled
            cloth round his head like a turban. Then smoking a woman's pipe,
            carrying a little basket, and spinning a cotton spindle, he
            paraded the village followed by a crowd roaring and shrieking
            with laughter, while he preserved the gravity of a judge, for a
            single smile would have been fatal. To guard against the
            possibility of unseasonable mirth, he carried a porcupine in his
            arms, and if ever, tickled beyond the pitch of endurance, he
            burst into a guffaw, the crowd said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It
            was the porcupine that laughed.”</span> All this was done to
            mortify the pride of the tiger's ghost by leading him to believe
            that he had been shot by a woman.<a id="noteref_709" name=

            circumcision. Thus, when Masai boys have been circumcised they
            dress as women, wearing earrings in their ears and long garments
            that reach to the ground. They also whiten their swarthy faces
            with chalk. This costume they retain till their wounds are

              </div>
            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like many
            peoples of Western Asia in antiquity, the Pelew Islanders
            systematically prostitute their unmarried girls for hire. Hence,
            just as in Lydia and Cyprus of old, the damsels are a source of
            income to their family, and women wait impatiently for the time
            when their young daughters will be able to help the household by
            their earnings. Indeed the mother regularly anticipates the time
            by depriving the girl of her virginity with her own hands.<a id=
            "noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href="#note_715"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a>
            Hence the theory that the prostitution of unmarried girls is a
            device to destroy their virginity without risk to their husbands
            is just as inapplicable to the Pelew Islanders as we have seen it
            to be to the peoples of Western Asia in antiquity. When a Pelew
            girl has thus been prepared for her vocation by her mother, she
            sells her favours to all the men of her village who can pay for
            them and who do not belong to her own exogamous clan; but she
            never grants her favours to the same man twice. Accordingly in
            every village of the Pelew Islands it may be taken as certain
            that the men and women know each other carnally, except that
            members of the same clan are debarred from each other by the rule
            of exogamy.<a id="noteref_716" name="noteref_716" href=
            "#note_716"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a>
            Thus a well-marked form of sexual communism, limited only by the
            exogamous prohibitions which attach to the clans, prevails among
            these people. Nor is this communism restricted to the inhabitants
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name=
            "Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the same
            village, for the girls of each village are regularly sent away to
            serve as prostitutes (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">armengols</span></span>) in another village.
            There they live with the men of one of the many clubs or
            associations (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">kaldebekels</span></span>) in the clubhouse
            (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">blay</span></span>), attending to the house,
            consorting freely with the men, and receiving pay for their
            services. A girl leading this life in the clubhouse of another
            village is well treated by the men: a wrong done to her is a
            wrong done to the whole club; and in her own village her value is
            increased, not diminished, by the time she thus spends as a
            prostitute in a neighbouring community. After her period of
            service is over she may marry either in the village where she has
            served or in her own. Sometimes many or all of the young women of
            a village go together to act as prostitutes (<span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">armengols</span></span>) in a neighbouring
            village, and for this they are well paid by the community which
            receives them. The money so earned is divided among the chiefs of
            the village to which the damsels belong. Such a joint expedition
            of the unmarried girls of a village is called a <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">blolobol</span></span>. But the young women

            prostituting them to men of other villages is a form of sexual
            communism practised between members of different local groups; it
            is a kind of group-marriage. These customs of the Pelew Islanders

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A somewhat
            similar custom prevails in Yap, one of the western group of the
            Caroline Islands, situated to the north of the Pelew group. In
            each of the men's clubhouses <span class="tei tei-q">“are kept

            to minister to the pleasures of the men of the particular clan or
            brotherhood to which the building belongs. As with the Kroomen on
            the Gold Coast, each man, married or single, takes his turn by
            rotation in the rites through which each girl must pass before
            she is deemed ripe for marriage. The natives say it is an ordeal
            or preliminary trial to fit them for the cares and burden of
            maternity. She is rarely a girl of the same village, and, of
            course, must be sprung from a different sept. Whenever she wishes
            to become a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

            woman, she may, and is thought none the less of for her frailties

            After she has been fairly, or unfairly, captured and installed in
            her new home, she loses no shade of respect among her own people;
            on the contrary, have not her beauty and her worth received the

            However, though the girl is nominally stolen from another
            district, the matter is almost always arranged privately with the

            the plot of death is commonly so well hushed up that it seldom
            miscarries. The first care of the conspirators is to discover
            where the doomed man keeps his money. For this purpose an old
            woman will sleep for some nights in the house and make inquiries
            quietly, till like a sleuth-hound she has nosed the hoard. Then
            the conspirators come, and the candidate for the chieftainship
            despatches his predecessor either with his own hand or by the
            hand of a young cousin. Having done the deed he takes possession
            of the official residence, and applies to the widow <span class=

            surrounding the house where the conspirators are ensconced they
            shower spears and stones at it, as if to inflict condign
            punishment on the assassins. But this is a mere blind, a sham, a
            legal fiction, intended perhaps to throw dust in the eyes of the
            ghost and make him think that his death is being avenged. In
            point of fact the warriors take good care to direct their
            missiles at the roof or walls of the house, for if they threw

            this formality has been satisfactorily performed, the regicide
            steps out of the house and engages in the genial task of paying
            the death duties to the various chiefs assembled. When he has

            to observe a long series of complicated and irksome formalities
            before he can make good his succession in the eyes of the law.
            For in that case the title of chief has to be formally withdrawn
            from the dead man and conferred on his successor by a curious
            ceremony, which includes the presentation of a coco-nut and a
            taro plant to the new chief. Moreover, at first he may not enter
            the chief's house, but has to be shut up in a tiny hut for thirty
            or forty days during all the time of mourning, and even when that
            is over he may not come out till he has received and paid for a
            human head brought him by the people of a friendly state. After
            that he still may not go to the sea-shore until more formalities
            have been fully observed. These comprise a very costly fishing
            expedition, which is conducted by the inhabitants of another
            district and lasts for weeks. At the end of it a net full of fish
            is brought to the chief's house, and the people of the
            neighbouring communities are summoned by the blast of trumpets.
            As soon as the stranger fishermen have been publicly paid for
            their services, a relative of the new chief steps across the net
            and solemnly splits a coco-nut in two with an old-fashioned knife
            made of a Tridacna shell, while at the same time he bans all the
            evils that might befall his kinsman. Then, without looking at the
            nut, he throws the pieces on the ground, and if they <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id=
            "Pg268" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fall so that the two halves
            lie with the opening upwards, it is an omen that the chief will
            live long. The pieces of the nut are then tied together and taken
            to the house of another chief, the friend of the new ruler, and
            there they are kept in token that the ceremony has been duly
            performed. Thereupon the fish are divided among the people, the
            strangers receiving half. This completes the legal ceremonies of
            accession, and the new chief may now go about freely. But these
            tedious formalities and others which I pass over are dispensed
            with when the new chief has proved his title by slaying his
            predecessor. In that case the procedure is much simplified, but
            on the other hand the death duties are so very heavy that only
            rich men can afford to indulge in the luxury of regicide. Hence
            in the Pelew Islands of to-day, or at least of yesterday, the
            old-fashioned mode of succession by slaughter is now restricted
            to a few families of the bluest blood and the longest
            purses.<a id="noteref_723" name="noteref_723" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this
            account of the existing or recent usage of the Pelew Islanders
            sheds little light on the motives for putting chiefs to death, it
            well illustrates the business-like precision with which such a
            custom may be carried out, and the public indifference, if not
            approval, with which it may be regarded as an ordinary incident
            of constitutional government. So far, therefore, the Pelew custom
            bears out the view that a systematic practice of regicide,
            however strange and revolting it may seem to us, is perfectly
            compatible with a state of society in which human conduct and
            human life are estimated by a standard very different from ours.
            If we would understand the early history of institutions, we must
            learn to detach ourselves from the prepossessions of our own time
            and country, and to place ourselves as far as possible at the
            standpoint of men in distant lands and distant ages.</p>

          The first series of the texts was discovered in 1880 when
          Mariette's workmen penetrated into the pyramid of King Pepi the

          as well as by Plutarch (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Isis et Osiris</span></span>, 12). The memory
          of the five supplementary days seems to survive in the modern
          Coptic calendar of Egypt. The days from the first to the sixth of
          Amshir (February) are called <span class="tei tei-q">“the days

          planting should be undertaken.”</span> However, these unlucky days
          are not the true intercalary days of the Coptic calendar, which
          occur in the second week of September at the end of the Coptic

          Plutarch but are known to us from Egyptian sources. The barbarous
          legend of the begetting of Horus by the dead Osiris is told in
          unambiguous language in the Pyramid Texts, and it is illustrated by
          a monument which represents the two sister goddesses hovering in
          the likeness of hawks over the god, while Hathor sits at his head
          and the Frog-goddess Heqet squats in the form of a huge frog at his
          feet. See J. H. Breasted, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          appears to be now generally held that the original seat of the
          worship of Osiris was at Busiris, but that at Abydos the god found
          a second home, which in time eclipsed the old one in glory.
          According to Professors Ed. Meyer and A. Erman, the god whom Osiris
          displaced at Abydos was Anubis.</dd>

          White Crown, worn by Osiris, was the symbol of the king's dominion
          over Upper Egypt; the flat Red Crown, with a high backpiece and a
          projecting spiral, was the symbol of his dominion over Lower Egypt.
          On the monuments the king is sometimes represented wearing a
          combination of the White and the Red Crown to symbolize his
          sovereignty over both the South and the North. White was the
          distinctive colour of Upper, as red was of Lower, Egypt. The
          treasury of Upper Egypt was called <span class="tei tei-q">“the

          prefers to suppose that the hawk, or rather the falcon, was the
          emblem of a god of light because the bird flies high in the sky
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.

          i. 12. 2, i. 14. 3). The ancient calendar of the Mexicans resembled
          that of the Egyptians except that it was divided into eighteen
          months of twenty days each (instead of twelve months of thirty days
          each), with five supplementary days added at the end of the year.
          These supplementary days (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nemontemi</span></span>)
          were deemed unlucky: nothing was done on them: they were dedicated

          Mexico</span></span> (London, 1807), i. 290. Unlike the Egyptian
          calendar, however, the Mexican appears to have been regularly
          corrected by intercalation so as to bring it into harmony with the
          solar year. But as to the mode of intercalation our authorities
          differ. According to the positive statement of Sahagun, one of the
          earliest and best authorities, the Mexicans corrected the
          deficiency of their year by intercalating one day in every fourth
          year, which is precisely the correction adopted in the Alexandrian
          and the Julian calendar. See B. de Sahagun, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> pp. 286 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the falsehood of the view that the bissextile year was unknown to
          the Mexicans. This weighty statement is confirmed by the practice
          of the Indians of Yucatan. Like the Aztecs, they reckoned a year to
          consist of 360 days divided into 18 months of 20 days each, with 5
          days added so as to make a total of 365 days, but every fourth year
          they intercalated a day so as to make a total of 366 days. See

          historian Clavigero, who lived in the eighteenth century, but used
          earlier authorities, tells us that the Mexicans <span class=

          days (making use here even of this favourite number) every

          the Nile rises in Egypt about the summer solstice (June 21) and

          This agrees exactly with the statement of Diodorus Siculus (i. 36.
          2). Herodotus says (ii. 19) that the rise of the river lasted for a

          beginning of November, and that the reaping began at the end of
          March and was completed in May. This certainly applies better to
          Lower than to Upper Egypt.</dd>

          rising of Sirius with the swelling of the Nile is mentioned by
          Tibullus (i. 7. 21 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>) and Aelian (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De natura
          animalium</span></span>, x. 45). In later times, as a consequence
          of the precession of the equinoxes, the rising of Sirius gradually
          diverged from the summer solstice, falling later and later in the
          solar year. In the sixteenth and fifteenth century <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Sirius rose seventeen
          days after the summer solstice, and at the date of the Canopic
          decree (238 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>) it rose a whole
          month after the first swelling of the Nile. See L. Ideler,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> i. 130; F. K. Ginzel, <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span> According to Censorinus
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De die
          natali</span></span>, xxi. 10), Sirius regularly rose in Egypt on
          the twentieth of July (Julian calendar); and this was true of
          latitude 30° in Egypt (the latitude nearly of Heliopolis and
          Memphis) for about three thousand years of Egyptian history. See L.
          Ideler, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">op. cit.</span></span> i. 128-130. But the
          date of the rising of the star is not the same throughout Egypt; it
          varies with the latitude, and the variation within the limits of
          Egypt amounts to seven days or more. Roughly speaking, Sirius rises
          nearly a whole day earlier for each degree of latitude you go
          south. Thus, whereas near Alexandria in the north Sirius does not
          rise till the twenty-second of July, at Syene in the south it rises
          on the sixteenth of July. See R. Lepsius, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> i. 168 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          cit.</span></span> i. 182 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span> Now it is to be remembered
          that the rising of the Nile, as well as the rising of Sirius, is
          observed earlier and earlier the further south you go. The
          coincident variation of the two phenomena could hardly fail to
          confirm the Egyptians in their belief of a natural or supernatural
          connexion between them.</dd>

            proves that, besides the shifting festivals of the shifting
            official year, the Egyptians celebrated other festivals, which
            were dated by direct observation of natural phenomena, namely,
            the annual inundation, the rise of Sirius, and the phases of the
            moon. The same distinction of the fixed from the movable
            festivals is indicated in one of the Hibeh papyri, but the
            passage is unfortunately mutilated. See <span class=

            Berenice was fixed on the day of the rising of Sirius. See the

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rise of
            Sirius was carefully observed by the islanders of Ceos, in the
            Aegean. They watched for it with arms in their hands and
            sacrificed on the mountains to the star, drawing from its aspect
            omens of the salubrity or unhealthiness of the coming year. The
            sacrifice was believed to secure the advent of the cool North
            winds (the Etesian winds as the Greeks call them), which
            regularly begin to blow about this time of the year, and mitigate
            the oppressive heat of summer in the Aegean. See Apollonius

            that in both these years the rising of Sirius nearly coincided
            with the summer solstice and the rising of the Nile; whereas in
            the year 1321 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> the summer
            solstice, and with it the rising of the Nile, fell nineteen days
            before the rising of Sirius and the first of Thoth. Now when we
            consider the close causal connexion which the Egyptians traced
            between the rising of Sirius and the rising of the Nile, it seems
            probable that they started the new calendar on the first of Thoth
            in a year in which the two natural phenomena coincided rather
            than in one in which they diverged from each other by nineteen
            days. Prof. Ed. Meyer decides in favour of the year 4241
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> as the date of the
            introduction of the Egyptian calendar on the ground that the
            calendar was already well known in the Old Kingdom. See L.

            the first of Thoth fell on August 29, which accordingly was
            thenceforth reckoned the first day of the year in the Alexandrian
            calendar. See L. Ideler, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            The period of 1460 solar or 1461 movable Egyptian years was
            variously called a Sothic period (Clement of Alexandria,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Strom.</span></span> i. 21. 136, p. 401 ed.
            Potter), a Canicular year (from <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Canicula</span></span>, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the Dog-star,”</span> that is, Sirius), a heliacal
            year, and a year of God (Censorinus, <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De die
            natali</span></span>, xviii. 10). But there is no evidence or
            probability that the period was recognized by the Egyptian
            astronomers who instituted the movable year of 365 days. Rather,
            as Ideler pointed out (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">op. cit.</span></span> i. 132), it must have
            been a later discovery based on continued observations of the
            heliacal rising of Sirius and of its gradual displacement through
            the whole length of the official calendar. Brugsch, indeed, went
            so far as to suppose that the period was a discovery of
            astronomers of the second century <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, to which they were
            led by the coincidence of the first of Thoth with the heliacal
            rising of Sirius in 139 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> (<span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die
            Ägyptologie</span></span>, p. 357). But the discovery, based as
            it is on a very simple calculation (365 × 4 = 1460), could hardly
            fail to be made as soon as astronomers estimated the length of
            the solar year at 365-¼ days, and that they did so at least as
            early as 238 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          month Damatrius (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the earth was laid bare by the retreat of the inundation, the

          was held at the new moon of the month Phamenoth, which, in the
          Alexandrian calendar, corresponded to February 24-March 26.
          Further, he tells us that a festival was celebrated on the 23rd of
          Phaophi after the autumn equinox (<span class=

          equinox (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          diverting the devotion of the people from the spirits of their dead
          appears to have been made in antiquity by the doctors of the
          Persian faith. For that faith <span class="tei tei-q">“in its most
          finished and purest form, in the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gathas</span></span>,
          does not recognize the dead as objects worthy of worship and
          sacrifice. But the popular beliefs were too firmly rooted, and the
          Mazdeans, like the sectaries of many other ideal and lofty forms of
          religion, were forced to give way. As they could not suppress the
          worship and get rid of the primitive and crude ideas involved in
          it, they set about the reform in another way: they interpreted the
          worship in a new manner, and thus the worship of the dead became a
          worship of the gods or of a god in favour of the loved and lost
          ones, a pious commemoration of their names and their
          virtues.”</span> See N. Söderblom, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les
          Fravashis</span></span> (Paris, 1899), pp. 6 <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          work based on the teaching of Philo of Alexandria. But this attempt

            the shift should have been 40, or rather 42 days, that being the
            interval between July 20 and August 29 or 31 (see the preceding
            note). If that shift was actually made, the calendar date of any
            festival in the old vague Egyptian year could be found by adding
            40 or 42 days to its date in the Alexandrian year. Thus if the
            death of Osiris fell on the 17th of Athyr in the Alexandrian
            year, it should have fallen on the 27th or 29th of Khoiak in the
            old vague year; and if his resurrection fell on the 19th of Athyr
            in the Alexandrian year, it should have fallen on the 29th of
            Khoiak or the 1st of Tybi in the old vague year. These
            calculations agree nearly, but not exactly, with the somewhat
            uncertain indications of the Denderah calendar (above, p.
            <a href="#Pg088" class="tei tei-ref">88</a>), and also with the
            independent evidence which we possess that the resurrection of
            Osiris was celebrated on the 30th of Khoiak (below, pp. <a href=
            "#Pg108" class="tei tei-ref">108</a> <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>).
            These approximate agreements to some extent confirm my theory
            that, with the adoption of the fixed Alexandrian year, the dates
            of the official Egyptian festivals were shifted from their
            accidental places in the calendar to their proper places in the
            natural year.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since I
            published in the first edition of this book (1906) my theory that
            with the adoption of the fixed Alexandrian year in 30
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> the Egyptian
            festivals were shifted about a month backward in the year,
            Professor Ed. Meyer has shown independent grounds for holding
            <span class="tei tei-q">“that the festivals which gave rise to
            the later names of the (Egyptian) months were demonstrably held a
            month later in earlier ages, under the twentieth, eighteenth,
            indeed partly under the twelfth dynasty; in other words, that
            after the end of the New Kingdom the festivals and the
            corresponding names of the months were displaced one month
            backwards. It is true that this displacement can as yet be proved
            for only five months; but as the names of these months and the
            festivals keep their relative position towards each other, the
            assumption is inevitable that the displacement affected not
            merely particular festivals but the whole system equally.”</span>
            See Ed. Meyer, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            possible that the displacement of the festivals by a month
            backward in the calendar took place a good deal earlier than I
            had supposed. In the uncertainty of the whole question I leave my
            theory as it stood.</p>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">If the results of the foregoing
          inquiry be accepted, the resurrection of Osiris was regularly
          celebrated in Egypt on the 15th of November from the year 30
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> onward, since the
          15th of November corresponded to the 19th of Athyr (the
          resurrection day) in the fixed Alexandrian year. This agrees with
          the indications of the Roman Rustic Calendars, which place the
          resurrection (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">heuresis</span></span>, that is, the discovery
          of Osiris) between the 14th and the 30th of November. Yet according
          to the calendar of Philocalus, the official Roman celebration of
          the resurrection seems to have been held on the 1st of November,
          not on the 15th. How is the discrepancy to be explained? Th.
          Mommsen supposed that the festival was officially adopted at Rome
          at a time when the 19th of Athyr of the vague Egyptian year
          corresponded to the 31st of October or the 1st of November of the
          Julian calendar, and that the Romans, overlooking the vague or
          shifting character of the Egyptian year, fixed the resurrection of
          Osiris permanently on the 1st of November. Now the 19th of Athyr of
          the vague year corresponded to the 1st of November in the years
          32-35 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> and to the 31st of
          October in the years 36-39; and it appears that the festival was
          officially adopted at Rome some time before 65 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> (Lucan, <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sqq.</span></span>). It is unlikely that the
          adoption took place in the reign of Tiberius, who died in 37
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>; for he is known to
          have persecuted the Egyptian religion (Tacitus, <span class=

          Jud.</span></span> xviii. 3. 4); hence Mommsen concluded that the
          great festival of Osiris was officially adopted at Rome in the
          early years of the reign of Caligula, that is, in 37, 38, or 39
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> See Th. Mommsen,

          Egypt the festivals were still regulated by the old vague year in
          the first century of our era. It cannot, therefore, be reconciled
          with the conclusion reached in the text that the Egyptian festivals
          ceased to be regulated by the old vague year from 30 <span class=

          difference of date between the official Roman and the Egyptian
          festival of the resurrection is to be explained, I do not pretend

          which hung on the sacred pine (above, vol. i. p. 267), and of the
          image of Osiris which was made out of a pine-tree and then buried
          in the hollow of the trunk (below, p. 108). The pine-tree on which
          Pentheus was pelted by the Bacchanals before they tore him limb
          from limb is said to have been worshipped as if it were the god
          himself by the Corinthians, who made two images of Dionysus out of
          it (Pausanias, ii. 2. 7). The tradition points to an intimate

          tells me that he believes Osiris to have been originally a
          cedar-tree god imported into Egypt from the Lebanon, and he regards
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          cedar-tree. The flail, as a symbol of Osiris, he believes to be the
          instrument used to collect incense. A similar flail is used by
          peasants in Crete to extract the ladanum gum from the shrubs. See

          insidious arts of magicians, he sets a bird-snare in the tree, and
          the first bird caught in the snare, or its right wing, embodies the
          life or soul of the tree. Accordingly the priest recites
          appropriate spells over the bird or its wing and hides it away in
          the forest. After that no evil-disposed magician can hurt the tree,
          since its life or soul is not in it but hidden away in the forest.

          The divine partner of Isis in later times, especially outside of
          Egypt, was Serapis, that is Osiris-Apis (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Asar-Ḥāpi</span></span>), the sacred Apis bull
          of Memphis, identified after death with Osiris. His oldest
          sanctuary was at Memphis (Pausanias, i. 18. 4), and there was one
          at Babylon in the time of Alexander the Great (Plutarch,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Alexander</span></span>, 76; Arrian,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Anabasis</span></span>, vii. 26). Ptolemy I.
          or II. built a great and famous temple in his honour at Alexandria,
          where he set up an image of the god which was commonly said to have
          been imported from Sinope in Pontus. See Tacitus, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histor.</span></span>

          Potter. In after ages the institution of the worship of Serapis was
          attributed to this Ptolemy, but all that the politic Macedonian
          monarch appears to have done was to assimilate the Egyptian Osiris
          to the Greek Pluto, and so to set up a god whom Egyptians and
          Greeks could unite in worshipping. Serapis gradually assumed the
          attributes of Aesculapius, the Greek god of healing, in addition to
          those of Pluto, the Greek god of the dead. See G. Lafaye,

          bodily and mental peculiarities some scholars conjectured that

          relations of Egypt to Byblus were very ancient and close; he even
          suggests that there may have been from early times an Egyptian
          colony, or at all events an Egyptian military post, in the city.
          The commercial importance of Byblus arose from its possession of
          the fine cedar forests on the Lebanon; the timber was exported to
          Egypt, where it was in great demand. See Ed. Meyer, <span class=

          The rule that the grafting of trees should be done at the waxing of
          the moon is laid down by Pliny (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nat.
          Hist.</span></span> xvii. 108). At Deutsch-Zepling in Transylvania,
          by an inversion of the usual custom, seed is generally sown at the
          waning of the moon (A. Heinrich, <span class=

          Gebräuche unter den Sachsen Siebenbürgens</span></span>,
          Hermannstadt, 1880, p. 7). Some French peasants also prefer to sow
          in the wane (F. Chapiseau, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Folk-lore de la Beauce et du
          Perche</span></span>, Paris, 1902, i. 291). In the Abruzzi also
          sowing and grafting are commonly done when the moon is on the wane;
          timber that is to be durable must be cut in January during the
          moon's decrease (G. Finamore, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

            Payne suggests that the custom of naming the months after the
            principal natural products that ripen in them may have
            contributed to the same result. The custom is certainly very
            common among savages, as I hope to show elsewhere, but whether it
            has contributed to foster the fallacy in question seems
            doubtful.</p>

          Flinders Petrie. That the festival occurred, theoretically at
          least, at intervals of thirty years, appears to be unquestionable;
          for in the Greek text of the Rosetta Stone Ptolemy V. is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lord of periods of thirty years,”</span>
          and though the corresponding part of the hieroglyphic text is lost,
          the demotic version of the words is <span class="tei tei-q">“master
          of the years of the Sed festival.”</span> See R. Lepsius,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.

          appear to have sometimes celebrated the festival at much shorter
          intervals, so that the dates of its recurrence cannot safely be
          used for chronological purposes. See Ed. Meyer, <span class=

            In support of the view that the king of Egypt was deemed to be
            born again at the Sed festival it has been pointed out that on
            these solemn occasions, as we learn from the monuments, there was
            carried before the king on a pole an object shaped like a
            placenta, a part of the human body which many savage or barbarous
            peoples regard as the twin brother or sister of the new-born
            child. See C. G. Seligmann and Margaret A. Murray, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Note upon an early Egyptian standard,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Man</span></span>, xi. (1911) pp. 165-171.
            The object which these writers take to represent a human placenta
            is interpreted by M. Alexandre Moret as the likeness of a human
            embryo. As to the belief that the afterbirth is a twin brother or
            sister of the infant, see above, vol. i. p. 93, and below, pp.

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Professor J.
            H. Breasted thinks that the Sed festival is probably <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the oldest religious feast of which any trace has
            been preserved in Egypt”</span>; he admits that on these
            occasions <span class="tei tei-q">“the king assumed the costume
            and insignia of Osiris, and undoubtedly impersonated him,”</span>
            and further that <span class="tei tei-q">“one of the ceremonies
            of this feast symbolized the resurrection of Osiris”</span>; but
            he considers that the significance of the festival is as yet
            obscure. See J. H. Breasted, <span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">l.c.</span></span>)
          that the Herero name for the good celestial God, whom they
          acknowledge but do not worship, is common, in different forms, to
          almost all the Bantu tribes. Among the Ovambo it is Kalunga; among
          tribes of Loango, the Congo, Angola and Benguela it is Zambi,
          Njambi, Ambi, Njame, Onjame, Ngambe, Nsambi; in the Cameroons it is
          Nzambi, etc. Compare John H. Weeks, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Among Congo
          Cannibals</span></span> (London, 1913), pp. 246 <span class=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“We have found a vague knowledge of a
          Supreme Being, and a belief in Him, very general among those tribes
          on the Congo with which we have come into contact.... On the Lower
          Congo He is called <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nzambi</span></span>, or by His fuller title
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nzambi a mpungu</span></span>; no satisfactory
          root word has yet been found for <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nzambi</span></span>, but for <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mpungu</span></span> there are sayings and
          proverbs that clearly indicate its meaning as, most of all,
          supreme, highest, and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nzambi a mpungu</span></span> as the Being
          most High, or Supreme. On the Upper Congo among the Bobangi folk
          the word used for the Supreme Being is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nyambe</span></span>; among the Lulanga
          people, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nzakomba</span></span>; among the Boloki,
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Njambe</span></span>; among the Bopoto people
          it is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Libanza</span></span>.... It is interesting to
          note that the most common name for the Supreme Being on the Congo
          is also known, in one form or another, over an extensive area of
          Africa reaching from 6° north of the Equator away to extreme South
          Africa; as, for example, among the Ashanti it is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Onyame</span></span>, at Gaboon it is
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Anyambie</span></span>, and two thousand miles
          away among the Barotse folk it is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Niambe</span></span>. These are the names that
          stand for a Being who is endowed with strength, wealth, and wisdom
          by the natives; and He is also regarded and spoken of by them as
          the principal Creator of the world, and the Maker of all things....
          But the Supreme Being is believed by the natives to have withdrawn
          Himself to a great distance after performing His creative works;
          that He has now little or no concern in mundane affairs; and
          apparently no power over spirits and no control over the lives of
          men, either to protect them from malignant spirits or to help them
          by averting danger. They also consider the Supreme Being
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nzambi</span></span>) as being so good and
          kind that there is no need to appease Him by rites, ceremonies or
          sacrifices. Hence they never pray to this Supreme One, they never
          worship Him, or think of Him as being interested in the doings of
          the world and its peoples.”</span></dd>

          gods of Abydos, and was certainly connected with the dead, being
          probably the ancient local god of the dead of Abydos and its
          neighbourhood. Now, in the Pyramid Texts, which were written under
          the VIth dynasty, there are several mentions of Khenti-Amenti, and
          in a large number of instances the name is preceded by that of
          Osiris. It is quite clear, therefore, that the chief attributes of
          the one god must have resembled those of the other, and that Osiris
          Khenti-Amenti was assumed to have absorbed the powers of
          Khenti-Amenti. In the representations of the two gods which are
          found at Abydos there is usually no difference, at least not under
          the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties”</span> (E. A. Wallis Budge,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.

          that the resemblance between the name of the god and the name of
          the king is more than accidental.</dd>

          20-22. The writer says that the family or clan gods of the Pelew
          Islanders are too many to be enumerated, but he gives as a specimen
          a list of the family deities of one particular district
          (Ngarupesang). Having done so he observes that they are all
          goddesses, and he adds that <span class="tei tei-q">“this is
          explained by the importance of the woman for the clan. The deity of
          the mother is inherited, that of the father is not”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">op.
          cit.</span></span> p. 22). As he says nothing to indicate that the
          family deities of this particular district are exceptional, we may
          infer, as I have done, that the deities of all the families or
          clans are goddesses. Yet a few pages previously (pp. 16
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sq.</span></span>) he tells us that a village
          which contains twenty families will have at least forty deities, if
          not more, <span class="tei tei-q">“for some houses may have two
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          house has also a goddess.”</span> This seems to imply that the
          families or clans have gods as well as goddesses. The seeming
          discrepancy is perhaps to be explained by another statement of the
          writer that <span class="tei tei-q">“in the family only the

          testimony to the existence of a true gynaecocracy in ancient Egypt,
          I am of opinion that the alleged superiority of the queen to the
          king and of the wife to her husband must have been to a great
          extent only nominal. Certainly we know that it was the king and not
          the queen who really governed the country; and we can hardly doubt
          that in like manner it was for the most part the husband and not
          the wife who really ruled the house, though unquestionably in
          regard to property the law seems to have granted important rights

          <span class="tei tei-q">“economical considerations, especially in

          marriages with sisters, the intention being in this way to avoid a

          understand from Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie that the theory has

          an expedient for shifting the succession from the female to the
          male line; but he did not extend the theory so as to explain
          similar marriages among common people in Egypt, perhaps because he
          was not aware of the facts. See J. F. McLennan, <span class=

          prove that husband and wife served the same god or pair of gods;
          and while the word was doubtfully derived by Varro from Jove
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De

          most lively manner.”</span> On the other hand, Prof. G. Wissowa
          supposes that Orcus is merely a borrowed form of the Greek Horkos
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Religion

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">2</span></span> p.

          a personified oath (ὅρκος; see Hesiod, <span class=

          ἐπιόρκοις), an abstract idea which makes no figure in Greek
          mythology and religion. That such a rare and thin Greek abstraction
          should through a gross misunderstanding be transformed into a
          highly popular Roman god of death, who not only passed muster with
          the people but was admitted by the pontiffs themselves to the
          national pantheon and honoured by them with a solemn ritual, is in
          the last degree improbable.</dd>

            these titles implied paternity or maternity is my own, but in the
            text I have given some reasons for thinking that the Romans
            themselves accepted the implication. Mr. W. Warde Fowler, on the
            other hand, prefers to suppose that the titles were employed in a
            merely figurative sense to <span class="tei tei-q">“imply the
            dependence of the human citizen upon his divine
            protector”</span>; but he admits that what exactly the Romans

            makes at the same time the important observation that the Romans
            never, so far as he is aware, applied the terms Father and Mother
            to foreign gods, but <span class="tei tei-q">“always to

          for holding that the old octennial cycle in Greece, based on an
          attempt to harmonize solar and lunar time, gave rise to an
          octennial festival at which the mythical marriage of the sun and
          moon was celebrated by the dramatic marriage of human actors, who
          appear sometimes to have been the king and queen. In the
          Laurel-bearing at Thebes a clear reference to the astronomical
          character of the festival is contained in the emblems of the sun,
          moon, stars, and days of the year which were carried in procession
          (Proclus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">l.c.</span></span>); and another reference to
          it may be detected in the legendary marriage of Cadmus and
          Harmonia. Dr. L. R. Farnell supposes that the festival of the
          Laurel-bearing <span class="tei tei-q">“belongs to the maypole
          processions, universal in the peasant-religion of Europe, of which
          the object is to quicken the vitalizing powers of the year in the
          middle of spring or at the beginning of summer”</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

          Wherever men regularly dress as women, we may suspect that a
          superstitious motive underlies the custom even though our
          authorities do not mention it. The custom is thus reported among
          the Italmenes of Kamtschatka (G. W. Steller, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beschreibung von dem
          Lande Kamtschatka</span></span>, Frankfort and Leipsic, 1774, pp.
          350 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          South-Eastern India (Capt. T. H. Lewin, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wild Races of
          South-Eastern India</span></span>, London, 1870, p. 255), and the
          Nogay or Mongutay of the Caucasus (J. Reinegg, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beschreibung des
          Kaukasus</span></span>, St. Petersburg, Gotha, and Hildesheim,
          1796-1797, i. 270). Among the Lhoosais or Lushais not only do men
          sometimes dress like women and consort and work with them (T. H.
          Lewin, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">l.c.</span></span>), but, on the other hand,
          women sometimes dress and live like men, adopting masculine habits
          in all respects. When one of these unsexed women was asked her
          reasons for adopting a masculine mode of life, she at first denied
          that she was a woman, but finally confessed <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“that her <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">khuavang</span></span> was not good, and so
          she became a man.”</span> See the extract from the <span class=

          transformation of women into men seems to be much rarer than the
          converse change of men into women.</dd>

          Hercules, and it seems probable that the rite was that of a Sacred

              the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</span></h2>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate" class=
              "tei tei-xref">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
              and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways

              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>
