Kabb&#275;ra.&mdash;The Kabb&#275;ras are a
caste of Canarese fishermen and cultivators. &ldquo;They are,&rdquo;
Mr. W. Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e404src" href=
"#xd21e404" name="xd21e404src">1 &ldquo;grouped into two divisions,
the Gaurimakkalu or sons of Gauri (Parvati) and the Gangimakkalu or
sons of Ganga, the goddess of water, and they do not intermarry, but
will dine together. Each has its bedagus (exogamous septs), and these
seem to be different in the two sub-divisions. The Gaurimakkalu are
scarce in Bellary, and belong chiefly to Mysore. They seem to be higher
in the social scale (as such things are measured among Hindus) than the
Gangimakkalu, as they employ Br&#257;hmans as priests instead of men of
their own caste, burn their dead instead of burying them, hold annual
ceremonies in memory of them, and prohibit the remarriage of widows.
The Gangimakkalu were apparently engaged originally in all the pursuits
connected with water, such as propelling boats, catching fish, and so
forth, and they are especially numerous in villages along the banks of
the Tungabhadra.&rdquo; Coracles are still used on various South Indian
rivers, e.g., the Cauvery, Bhav&#257;ni, and Tungabhadra.
Tavernier, on [<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2]his way to Golgonda, wrote that &ldquo;the boats
employed in crossing the river are like large baskets, covered outside
with ox-hides, at the bottom of which some faggots are placed, upon
which carpets are spread to put the baggage and goods upon, for fear
they should get wet.&rdquo; Bishop Whitehead has recently<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e412src" href="#xd21e412" name="xd21e412src">2
placed on record his experiences of coracles as a means of conveyance.
&ldquo;We embarked,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;in a boat (at Hampi on the
Tungabhadra) which exactly corresponds to my idea of the coracle of the
ancient Britons. It consists of a very large, round wicker basket,
about eight or nine feet in diameter, covered over with leather, and
propelled by paddles. As a rule, it spins round and round, but the
boatmen can keep it fairly straight, when exhorted to do so, as they
were on this occasion. Some straw had been placed in the bottom of the
coracle, and we were also allowed the luxury of chairs to sit upon, but
it is safer to sit on the straw, as a chair in a coracle is generally
in a state of unstable equilibrium. I remember once crossing a river in
the Trichinopoly district in a coracle, to take a confirmation at a
village on the other side. It was thought more suitable to the dignity
of the occasion that I should sit upon a chair in the middle of the
coracle, and I weakly consented to do so. All the villagers were
assembled to meet us on the opposite bank; four policemen were drawn up
as a guard of honour, and a brass band, brought from Tanjore, stood
ready in the background. As we came to the shore, the villagers
salaamed, the guard of honour saluted, the band struck up a tune
faintly resembling &lsquo;See the conquering hero comes,&rsquo; the
coracle bumped heavily against the shelving bank, my chair tipped up,
[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3]and I was deposited, heels up, on my back in the
straw!... We were rowed for about two miles down the stream. The
current was very swift, and there were rapids at frequent intervals.
Darkness overtook us, and it was not altogether a pleasant sensation
being whirled swiftly over the rapids in our frail-looking boat, with
ugly rocks jutting out of the stream on either side. But the boatmen
seemed to know the river perfectly, and were extraordinarily expert in
steering the coracle with their paddles.&rdquo; The arrival in 1847 of
the American Missionary, John Eddy Chandler at Madura, when the Vaigai
river was in flood, has been described as follows.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e418src" href="#xd21e418" name="xd21e418src">3
&ldquo;Coolies swimming the river brought bread and notes from the
brethren and sisters in the city. At last, after three days of waiting,
the new Missionaries safely reached the mission premises in Madura.
Messrs. Rendall and Cherry managed to cross to them, and they all
recrossed into the city by a large basket boat, eight or ten feet in
diameter, with a bamboo pole tied across the top for them to hold on
to. The outside was covered with leather. Ropes attached to all sides
were held by a dozen coolies as they dragged it across, walking and
swimming.&rdquo; In recent years, a coracle has been kept at the
traveller&rsquo;s bungalow at Paik&#257;ra on the N&#299;lgiris for the
use of anglers in the Paik&#257;ra river.
&ldquo;The Kabb&#275;ras,&rdquo; Mr. Francis continues, &ldquo;are
at present engaged in a number of callings, and, perhaps in
consequence, several occupational sub-divisions have arisen, the
members of which are more often known by their occupational title than
as either Gangimakkalu or Kabb&#275;ras. The B&#257;rikes, for example,
are a class of village servants who keep the village ch&#257;vadi
(caste [<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4]meeting house) clean, look after the wants of
officials halting in the village, and do other similar duties. The
Jalakaras are washers of gold-dust; the Madderu are dyers, who use the
root of the maddi (Morinda citrifolia) tree; and
apparently (the point is one which I have not had time to clear up) the
Besthas, who have often been treated as a separate caste, are really a
sub-division of the Gangimakkalu, who were originally
palanquin-bearers, but, now that these vehicles have gone out of
fashion, are employed in divers other ways. The betrothal is formally
evidenced by the partaking of betel-leaf in the girl&rsquo;s house, in
the manner followed by the Kurubas. As among the M&#257;digas, the
marriage is not consummated for three months after its celebration. The
caste follow the Kuruba ceremony of calling back the dead.&rdquo;
Consummation is, as among the Kurubas and M&#257;digas, postponed for
three months, as it is considered unlucky to have three heads of a
family in a household during the first year of marriage. By the delay,
the birth of a child should take place only in the second year, so
that, during the first year, there will be only two heads, husband and
wife. In the ceremony of calling back the dead, referred to by Mr.
Francis, a pot of water is worshipped in the house on the eleventh day
after a funeral, and taken next morning to some lonely place, where it
is emptied.
For the following note on the Kabb&#275;ras of the Bellary district,
I am indebted to Mr. Kothandram Naidu. The caste is sometimes called
Ambiga. Breaches of caste rules and customs are enquired into by a
panchayat presided over by a headman called Kattemaniavaru. If the fine
inflicted on the offender is a heavy one, half goes to the headman, and
half to the caste people, who spend it in drink. In serious cases,
[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5]the offender has to be purified by shaving and
drinking holy water (thirtam) given to him by the headman. Both infant
and adult marriage are practiced. Sexual license previous to marriage
is tolerated, but, before that takes place, the contracting couple have
to pay a fine to the headman. At the marriage ceremony, the t&#257;li
is tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck by a Br&#257;hman. Married women
carry painted new pots with lights, bathe the bride and bridegroom,
etc. Widows are remarried with a ceremonial called Udiki, which is
performed at night in a temple by widows, one of whom ties the
t&#257;li. No married men or women may be present, and music is not
allowed. Divorce is said to be not permitted. In religion the
Kabb&#275;ras are Vaishnavites, and worship various village deities.
The dead are buried. Cloths and food are offered to ancestors during
the Dasara festival, excepting those who have died a violent death.
Some unmarried girls are dedicated to the goddess Hulugamma as Basavis
(dedicated prostitutes).
Concerning an agricultural ceremony in the Bellary district, in
which the Kabb&#275;ras take part, I gather that &ldquo;on the first
full-moon day in the month of Bhadrapada (September), the agricultural
population celebrate a feast called Jokumara, to appease the rain-god.
The Barikas (women), who are a sub-division of the Kabb&#275;ra caste
belonging to the Gaurimakkalu section, go round the town or village in
which they live, with a basket on their heads containing margosa
(Melia Azadirachta) leaves, flowers of various kinds, and holy
ashes. They beg alms, especially of the cultivating classes
(K&#257;pus), and, in return for the alms bestowed (usually grain and
food), they give some of the margosa leaves, flowers, and ashes. The
K&#257;pus, or cultivators, take the margosa leaves, flowers, and ashes
to their fields, prepare cholum [<a id="pb6"
href="#pb6" name="pb6">6](Andropogon Sorghum) kanji,
mix these with it, and sprinkle this kanji, or gruel, all round their
fields. After this, the K&#257;pu proceeds to the potter&rsquo;s kiln
in the village or town, fetches ashes from it, and makes a figure of a
human being. This figure is placed prominently in some convenient spot
in the field, and is called Jokumara, or rain-god. It is supposed to
have the power of bringing down the rain in proper time. The figure is
sometimes small, and sometimes big.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

K&#257;dir.&mdash;The K&#257;dirs or K&#257;dans inhabit the
&#256;naimalai or elephant hills, and the great mountain range which
extends thence southward into Travancore. A night journey by rail to
Coimbatore, and forty miles by [<a id="pb7" href=
"#pb7" name="pb7">7]road at the mercy of a typically
obstinate jutka pony, which landed me in a dense patch of prickly-pear
(Opuntia Dillenii), brought me to the foot of the hills at
S&#275;thumadai, where I came under the kindly hospitality of Mr. H. A.
Gass, Conservator of Forests, to whom I am indebted for much
information on forest and tribal matters gathered during our camp life
at Mount Stuart, situated 2,350 feet above sea-level, in the midst of a
dense bamboo jungle, and playfully named after Sir Mountstuart Grant
Duff, who visited the spot during his quinquennium as Governor of
Madras.
At S&#275;thumadai I made the acquaintance of my first K&#257;dir,
not dressed, as I hoped, in a primitive garb of leaves, but wearing a
coloured turban and the cast-off red coat of a British soldier, who had
come down the hill to carry up my camp bath, which acted as an
excellent umbrella, to protect him from the driving monsoon showers.
Very glad was I of his services in helping to convey my clothed, and
consequently helpless self, across the mountain torrents, swollen by a
recent burst of monsoon rain.
The K&#257;dir forest guards, of whom there are several in
Government service, looked, except for their noses, very unjungle-like
by contrast with their fellow-tribesmen, being smartly dressed in
regulation Norfolk jacket, knickerbockers, pattis (leggings), buttons,
and accoutrements.
On arrival at the forest dep&ocirc;t, with its comfortable bungalows
and K&#257;dir settlement, I was told by a native servant that his
master was away, as an &ldquo;elephant done tumble in a fit.&rdquo; My
memory went back to the occasion many years ago, when, as a medical
student, I took part in the autopsy of an elephant, which died in
convulsions at the London Zoological Gardens. It transpired later
[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8]in the day that a young and grown-up cow elephant
had tumbled, not in a fit, but into a pit made with hands for the
express purpose of catching elephants. The story has a philological
significance, and illustrates the difficulty which the Tamulian
experiences in dealing with the letter F. An incident is still
cherished at Mount Stuart in connection with a sporting globe-trotter,
who was accredited to the Conservator of Forests for the purpose of
putting him on to &ldquo;bison&rdquo; (the gaur, Bos gaurus),
and other big game. On arrival at the dep&ocirc;t, he was informed that
his host had gone to see the &ldquo;ellipence.&rdquo; Incapable of
translating the pigeon-English of the native butler, and, concluding
that a financial reckoning was being suggested, he ordered the servant
to pay the baggage coolies their elli-pence, and send them away. To a
crusted Anglo-Indian it is clear that ellipence could only mean
elephants. Sir M. E. Grant Duff tells<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e496src" href="#xd21e496" name="xd21e496src">7 the following
story of a man, who was shooting on the &#256;naimalais. In his camp
was an elephant, who, in the middle of the night, began to eat the
thatch of the hut, in which he was sleeping. His servant in alarm
rushed in and awoke him, saying &ldquo;Elephant, Sahib, must, must
(mad).&rdquo; The sleeper, half-waking and rolling over, replied
&ldquo;Oh, bother the elephant. Tell him he mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
The salient characteristics of the K&#257;dirs may be briefly summed
up as follows: short stature, dark skin, platyrhine. Men and women have
the teeth chipped. Women wear a bamboo comb in the back-hair. Those
whom I met spoke a Tamil patois, running up the scale in talking, and
finishing, like a Suffolker, on a higher note than they commenced on.
But I am told that some [<a id="pb9" href="#pb9"
name="pb9">9]of them speak a mixture of debased Tamil and
Malay&#257;lam. I am informed by Mr. Vincent that the K&#257;dirs have
a peculiar word &#256;li, denoting apparently a fellow or thing, which
they apply as a suffix to names, e.g., Karaman &#256;li, black
fellow; Mudi &#256;li, hairy fellow<span class="corr" id="xd21e506"
title="Not in source">; Kutti &#256;li, man with a knife;
P&#363;v &#256;li, man with a flower. Among nicknames, the following
occur: white mother, white flower, beauty, tiger, milk, virgin, love,
breasts. The K&#257;dirs are excellent mimics, and give a clever
imitation of the mode of speech of the Muduvans, Malasars, and other
hill tribes.
<img src=
"images/pl3-009.jpg" alt="K&#257;dir Huts." width="720" height="516">
K&#257;dir Huts.

The K&#257;dirs afford a typical example of happiness without
culture. Unspoiled by education, the advancing wave of which has not
yet engulfed them, they still retain many of their simple
&ldquo;manners and customs.&rdquo; Quite refreshing was it to hear the
hearty shrieks of laughter of the nude curly-haired children, wholly
illiterate, and happy in their ignorance, as they played at funerals,
or indulged in the amusement of making mud pies, and scampered off to
their huts on my appearance. The uncultured K&#257;dir, living a hardy
out-door life, and capable of appreciating to the full the enjoyment of
an &ldquo;apathetic rest&rdquo; as perfect bliss, has, I am convinced,
in many ways, the advantage over the poor under-fed student with a
small-paid appointment under Government as the narrow goal to which the
laborious passing of examination tests leads.
Living an isolated existence, confined within the thinly-populated
jungle, where Nature furnishes the means of obtaining all the
necessaries of life, the K&#257;dir possesses little, if any, knowledge
of cultivation, and objects to doing work with a m&#257;muti, the
instrument which serves the gardener in the triple capacity of spade,
rake, and hoe. But armed with a keen-edged bill-hook <span class=
"pagenum">[10]he is
immense. As Mr. O. H. Bensley says:<a class="noteref" id="xd21e520src"
href="#xd21e520" name="xd21e520src">8 &ldquo;The axiom that the
less civilised men are, the more they are able to do every thing for
themselves, is well illustrated by the hill-man, who is full of
resource. Give him a simple bill-hook, and what wonders he will
perform. He will build houses out of et&acirc;h, so neat and
comfortable as to be positively luxurious. He will bridge a stream with
canes and branches. He will make a raft out of bamboo, a carving knife
out of et&acirc;h, a comb out of bamboo, a fishing-line out of fibre,
and fire from dry wood. He will find food for you where you think you
must starve, and show you the branch which, if cut, will give you
drink. He will set traps for beasts and birds, which are more effective
than some of the most elaborate products of machinery.&rdquo; A
European, overtaken by night in the jungle, unable to light fire by
friction or to climb trees to gather fruits, ignorant of the edible
roots and berries, and afraid of wild beasts, would, in the absence of
comforts, be quite as unhappy and ill-at-ease as a K&#257;dir
surrounded by plenty at an official dinner party.
At the forest dep&ocirc;t the K&#257;dir settlement consists of
neatly constructed huts, made of bamboo deftly split with a bill-hook
in their long axis, thatched with leaves of the teak tree (Tectona
grandis) and bamboo (Ochlandra travancorica), and divided
off into verandah and compartments by means of bamboo partitions. But
the K&#257;dirs are essentially nomad in habit, living in small
communities, and shifting from place to place in the jungle, whence
they suddenly re-appear as casually as if they had only returned from a
morning stroll instead of a long camping expedition. When wandering in
the jungle, the K&#257;dirs [<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11]make a rough lean-to shed covered
over with leaves, and keep a small fire burning through the night, to
keep off bears, elephants, tigers, and leopards. They are, I am told,
fond of dogs, which they keep chiefly as a protection against wild
beasts at night. The camp fire is lighted by means of a flint and the
floss of the silk-cotton tree (Bombax malabaricum), over which
powdered charcoal has been rubbed. Like the Kurumbas, the K&#257;dirs
are not, in a general way, afraid of elephants, but are careful to get
out of the way of a cow with young, or a solitary rover, which may mean
mischief. On the day following my descent from Mount Stuart, an
Odd&#275; cooly woman was killed on the gh&#257;t road by a solitary
tusker. Familiarity with wild beasts, and comparative immunity from
accident, have bred contempt for them, and the K&#257;dirs will go
where the European, fresh to elephant land, fears to tread, or conjures
every creak of a bamboo into the approach of a charging tusker. As an
example of pluck worthy of a place in Kipling&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Jungle-book,&rsquo; I may cite the case of a hill-man and his
wife, who, overtaken by night in the jungle, decided to pass it on a
rock. As they slept, a tiger carried off the woman. Hearing her
shrieks, the sleeping man awoke, and followed in pursuit in the vain
hope of saving his wife. Coming on the beast in possession of the
mangled corpse, he killed it at close quarters with a spear. Yet he was
wholly unconscious that he had performed an act of heroism worthy of
the bronze cross &lsquo;for valour.&rsquo;
<img src=
"images/pl3-011.jpg" alt="K&#257;dir." width="520" height="720">
K&#257;dir.

The K&#257;dirs carry loads strapped on the back over the shoulders
by means of fibre, instead of on the head in the manner customary among
coolies in the plains; and women on the march may be seen carrying the
cooking utensils on their backs, and often have a child strapped on the
top of their household goods. The dorsal position <span class=
"pagenum">[12]of the
babies, huddled up in a dirty cloth, with the ends slung over the
shoulders and held in the hands over the chest, at once caught my eye,
as it is contrary to the usual native habit of straddling the infants
across the loins as a saddle.
Mr. Vincent informs me that &ldquo;when the planters first came to
the hills, the K&#257;dirs were found practically without clothes of
any description, with very few ornaments, and looking very lean and
emaciated. All this, however, changed with the advent of the European,
as the K&#257;dirs then got advances in hard cash, clothes, and grain,
to induce them to work. For a few years they tried to work hard, but
were failures, and now I do not suppose that a dozen men are employed
on the estates on the hills. They would not touch manure owing to caste
scruples; they could not learn to prune; and with a mamoti (spade) they
always promptly proceeded to chop their feet about in their efforts to
dig pits.&rdquo; The K&#257;dirs have never claimed, like the Todas,
and do not possess any land on the hills. But the Government has
declared the absolute right of the hill tribes to collect all the minor
forest produce, and to sell it to the Government through the medium of
a contractor, whose tender has been previously accepted. The contractor
pays for the produce in coin at a fair market rate, and the K&#257;dirs
barter the money so obtained for articles of food with contractors
appointed by Government to supply them with their requirements at a
fixed rate, which will leave a fair, but not exorbitant margin of
profit to the vendor. The principal articles of minor forest produce of
the &#256;naimalai hills are wax, honey, cardamoms, myrabolams, ginger,
dammer, turmeric, deer horns, elephant tusks, and rattans. And of
these, cardamoms, wax, honey, and rattans are the most important. Honey
and wax are [<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13]collected at all seasons, and cardamoms from
September to November. The total value of the minor produce collected,
in 1897&ndash;98, in the South Coimbatore division (which includes the
&#256;naimalais) was Rs. 7,886. This sum was exceptionally high owing
to a good cardamom crop. An average year would yield a revenue of Rs.
4,000&ndash;5,000, of which the K&#257;dirs receive approximately 50
per cent. They work for the Forest Department on a system of short
advances for a daily wage of 4 annas. And, at the present day, the
interests of the Forest Department and planters, who have acquired land
on the &#256;naimalais, both anxious to secure hill men for labour,
have come into mild collision.
<img src=
"images/pl3-013.jpg" alt="K&#257;dir." width="529" height="720">
K&#257;dir.

Some K&#257;dirs are good trackers, and a few are good
shik&#257;ris. A zoological friend, who had nicknamed his small child
his &ldquo;little shikar&#299;&rdquo; (=little sportsman) was quite
upset because I, hailing from India, did not recognise the word with
his misplaced accent. One K&#257;dir, named Viapoori Muppan, is still
held in the memory of Europeans, who made a good living, in days gone
by, by shooting tuskers, and had one arm blown off by the bursting of a
gun. He is reputed to have been a much married man, greatly addicted to
strong drinks, and to have flourished on the proceeds of his tusks. At
the present day, if a K&#257;dir finds tusks, he must declare the find
as treasure-trove, and hand it over to Government, who rewards him at
the rate of Rs. 15 to Rs. 25 per maund of 25 lb. according to the
quality. Government makes a good profit on the transaction, as
exceptionally good tusks have been known to sell for Rs. 5 per lb. If
the find is not declared, and discovered, the possessor thereof is
punished for theft according to the Act. By an elastic use of the word
cattle, it is, for the purposes of the Madras Forest Act, made to
include such a heterogeneous [<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14]zoological collection of animals as
elephants, sheep, pigs, goats, camels, buffaloes, horses&mdash;and
asses. This classification recalls to mind the occasion on which the
Flying-fox or Fox-bat was included in an official list of the
insectivorous birds of the Presidency; and, further, a report on the
wild animals of a certain district, which was triumphantly headed with
the &ldquo;wild tattu,&rdquo; the long-suffering, but pig-headed
country pony.
I gather, from an account of the process by one who had considerable
knowledge of the K&#257;dirs, that &ldquo;they will only remove the
hives of bees during dark nights, and never in the daytime or on
moonlight nights. In removing them from cliffs, they use a chain made
of bamboo or rattan, fixed to a stake or a tree on the top. The man,
going down this fragile ladder, will only do so while his wife, or son
watches above to prevent any foul play. They have a superstition that
they should always return by the way they go down, and decline to get
to the bottom of the cliff, although the distance may be less, and the
work of re-climbing avoided. For hives on trees, they tie one or more
long bamboos to reach up to the branch required, and then climb up.
They then crawl along the branch until the hive is reached. They devour
the bee-bread and the bee-maggots or larv&aelig;, swallowing the wax as
well.&rdquo; In a note on a shooting expedition in Travancore,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e561src" href="#xd21e561" name="xd21e561src">9
Mr. J. D. Rees, describing the collection of honey by the K&#257;dirs
of the southern hills, says that they &ldquo;descend giddy precipices
at night, torch in hand, to smoke out the bees, and take away their
honey. A stout creeper is suspended over the abyss, and it is
established law of the jungle that no brother shall assist in holding
it. But it is more [<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"
name="pb15">15]interesting to see them run a ladder a
hundred feet up the perpendicular stem of a tree, than to watch them
disappearing over a precipice. Axe in hand, the honey-picker makes a
hole in the bark for a little peg, standing on which he inserts a
second peg higher up, ties a long cane from one to the other, and by
night&mdash;for the darkness gives confidence&mdash;he will ascend the
tallest trees, and bring down honey without any accident.&rdquo; I have
been told, with how much of truth I know not, that, when a K&#257;dir
goes down the face of a rock or precipice in search of honey, he
sometimes takes with him, as a precautionary measure, and guarantee of
his safety, the wife of the man who is holding the ladder above.
Often, when out on the tramp with the late Government Botanist, Mr.
M. A. Lawson, I have heard him lament that it is impossible to train
arboreal monkeys to collect specimens of the fruit and flowers of lofty
forest trees, which are inaccessible to the ordinary man. Far superior
to any trained Simian is the K&#257;dir, who, by means of pegs or
notches, climbs even the tallest masts of trees with an agility which
recalls to memory the celebrated picture in &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo;
representing Darwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Habit of climbing plants.&rsquo; For
the ascent of comparatively low trees, notches are made with a
bill-hook, alternately right and left, at intervals of about thirty
inches. To this method the K&#257;dir will not have recourse in wet
weather, as the notches are damp and slippery, and there is the danger
of an insecure foot-hold.
An important ethnographic fact, and one which is significant, is
that the detailed description of tree-climbing by the Dyaks of Borneo,
as given by Wallace,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e570src" href=
"#xd21e570" name="xd21e570src">10 might have been written on the
&#256;naimalai hills, and would [<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16]apply equally well in every
detail to the K&#257;dir. &ldquo;They drove in,&rdquo; Wallace writes,
&ldquo;a peg very firmly at about three feet from the ground, and,
bringing one of the long bamboos, stood it upright close to the tree,
and bound it firmly to the two first pegs by means of a bark cord and
small notches near the head of each peg. One of the Dyaks now stood on
the first peg and drove in a third about level with his face, to which
he tied the bamboo in the same way, and then mounted another step,
standing on one foot, and holding by the bamboo at the peg immediately
above him, while he drove in the next one. In this manner he ascended
about twenty feet, when the upright bamboo became thin; another was
handed up by his companion, and this was joined on by tying both
bamboos to three or four of the pegs. When this was also nearly ended,
a third was added, and shortly after the lowest branch of the tree was
reached, along which the young Dyak scrambled. The ladder was perfectly
safe, since, if any one peg were loose or faulty, the strain would be
thrown on several others above and below it. I now understood the use
of the line of bamboo pegs sticking in trees, which I had often
seen.&rdquo;
In their search for produce in the evergreen forests of the higher
ranges, with their heavy rainfall, the K&#257;dirs became unpleasantly
familiar with leeches and blue bottle flies, which flourish in the
moist climate. And it is recorded that a K&#257;dir, who had been gored
and wounded by a bull &lsquo;bison,&rsquo; was placed in a position of
safety while a friend ran to the village to summon help. He was not
away for more than an hour, but, in that short time, flies had
deposited thousands of maggots in the wounds, and, when the man was
brought into camp, they had already begun burrowing into the flesh, and
were with difficulty extracted. On another occasion, <span class=
"pagenum">[17]the
eye-witness of the previous unappetising incident was out alone in the
forest, and shot a tiger two miles or so from his camp. Thither he went
to collect coolies to carry in the carcase, and was away for about two
hours, during which the flies had, like the child in the story,
&lsquo;not been idle,&rsquo; the skin being a mass of maggots and
totally ruined. I have it on authority that, like the Kotas of the
N&#299;lgiris, the K&#257;dirs will eat the putrid and fly-blown flesh
of carcases of wild beasts, which they come across in their wanderings.
To a dietary which includes succulent roots, which they upturn with a
digging stick, bamboo seed, sheep, fowls, rock-snakes (python), deer,
porcupines, rats (field, not house), wild pigs, monkeys, etc., they do
credit by displaying a hard, well-nourished body. The mealy portion of
the seeds of the Cycas tree, which flourishes on the lower
slopes of the &#256;naimalais, forms a considerable addition to the
m&eacute;nu. In its raw state the fruit is said to be poisonous, but it
is evidently wholesome when cut into slices, thoroughly soaked in
running water, dried, and ground into flour for making cakes, or baked
in hot ashes. Mr. Vincent writes that, &ldquo;during March, April, and
May, the K&#257;dirs have a glorious time. They usually manage to find
some wild sago palms, called by them koondtha panai, of the proper age,
which they cut down close to the ground. They are then cut into lengths
of about 1&frac12; feet, and split lengthways. The sections are then
beaten very hard and for a long time with mallets, and become separated
into fibre and powder. The powder is thoroughly wetted, tied in cloths
and well beaten with sticks. Every now and then, between the beatings,
the bag of powder is dipped in water, and well strained. It is then all
put into water, when the powder sinks, and the water is poured off. The
residue is well boiled, [<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18]with constant stirring, and, when it
is of the consistency of rubber, and of a reddish brown colour, it is
allowed to cool, and then cut in pieces to be distributed. This food
stuff is palatable enough, but very tough.&rdquo; The K&#257;dir is
said to prefer roasting and eating the flesh of animals with the skin
on. For catching rats, jungle-fowl, etc., he resorts to cunningly
devised snares and traps made of bamboo and fibre, as a substitute for
a gun. Porcupines are caught by setting fire to the scrub jungle round
them as they lie asleep, and thus smoking and burning them to
death.

K&#257;dir Tree-climbing.

When a K&#257;dir youth&rsquo;s thoughts turn towards matrimony, he
is said to go to the village of his bride-elect, and give her a dowry
by working there for a year. On the wedding day a feast of rice, sheep,
fowls, and other luxuries is given by the parents of the bridegroom, to
which the K&#257;dir community is invited. The bride and bridegroom
stand beneath a pandal (arch) decorated with flowers, which is erected
outside the home of the bridegroom, while men and women dance
separately to the music of drum and fife. The bridegroom&rsquo;s mother
or sister ties the t&#257;li (marriage badge) of gold or silver round
the bride&rsquo;s neck, and her father puts a turban on the head of the
bridegroom. The contracting parties link together the little fingers of
their right hands as a token of their union, and walk in procession
round the pandal. Then, sitting on a reed mat of K&#257;dir
manufacture, they exchange betel. The marriage tie can be dissolved for
incompatibility of temper, disobedience on the part of the wife,
adultery, etc., without appeal to any higher authority than a council
of elders, who pronounce judgment on the evidence. As an illustration
of the manner in which such a council of hill-men disposes of cases,
Mr. Bensley [<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19]cites the case of a man who was made to carry
forty basket loads of sand to the house of the person against whom he
had offended. He points out how absolute is the control exercised by
the council. Disobedience would be followed by excommunication, and
this would mean being turned out into the jungle, to obtain a living in
the best way one could.
By one K&#257;dir informant I was assured, as he squatted on the
floor of my bungalow at &ldquo;question time,&rdquo; that it is
essential that a wife should be a good cook, in accordance with a maxim
that the way to the heart is through the mouth. How many men in
civilised western society, who suffer from marrying a wife wholly
incompetent, like the first Mrs. David Copperfield, to conduct the
housekeeping, might well be envious of the system of marriage as a
civil contract to be sealed or unloosed according to the cookery
results! Polygyny is indulged in by the K&#257;dirs, who agree with
Benedick that &ldquo;the world must be peopled,&rdquo; and hold more
especially that the numerical strength of their own tribe must be
maintained. The plurality of wives seems to be mainly with the desire
for offspring, and the father-in-law of one of the forest-guards
informed me that he had four wives living. The first two wives
producing no offspring, he married a third, who bore him a solitary
male child. Considering the result to be an insufficient contribution
to the tribe, he married a fourth, who, more prolific than her
colleagues, gave birth to three girls and a boy, with which he remained
content. In the code of polygynous etiquette, the first wife takes
precedence over the others, and each wife has her own cooking
utensils.
Special huts are maintained for women during menstruation and
parturition. Mr. Vincent informs me that, when a girl reaches puberty,
the friends of the [<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20]family gather together, and a great feast is
prepared. All her friends and relations give her a small present of
money, according to their means. The girl is decorated with the family
jewelry, and made to look as smart as possible. For the first menstrual
period, a special hut, called mutthu salai or ripe house, is
constructed for the girl to live in during the period of pollution; but
at subsequent periods, the ordinary menstruation hut, or unclean house,
is used. All girls are said to change their names when they reach
puberty. For three months after the birth of a child, the woman is
considered unclean. When the infant is a month old, it is named without
any elaborate ceremonial, though the female friends of the family
collect together. Sexual intercourse ceases on the establishment of
pregnancy, and the husband indulges in promiscuity. Widows are not
allowed to re-marry, but may live in a state of concubinage. Women are
said to suckle their children till they are two or three years old, and
a mother has been seen putting a lighted cigarette to the lips of a
year old baby immediately after suckling it. If this is done with the
intention of administering a sedative, it is less baneful than the
pellet of opium administered by ayahs (nurses) to Anglo-Indian babies
rendered fractious by troubles climatic, dental, and other. The
K&#257;dir men are said to consume large quantities of opium, which is
sold to them illicitly. They will not allow the women or children to
eat it, and have a belief that the consumption thereof by women renders
them barren. The women chew tobacco. The men smoke the coarse tobacco
as sold in the bazars, and showed a marked appreciation of
Spencer&rsquo;s Torpedo cheroots, which I distributed among them for
the purposes of bribery and conciliation. [<a id=
"pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21]
The religion of the K&#257;dirs is a crude polytheism, and vague
worship of stone images or invisible gods. It is, as Mr. Bensley
expresses it, an ejaculatory religion, finding vent in uttering the
names of the gods and demons. The gods, as enumerated and described to
me, were as follows:&mdash;
(1) Paikutl&#257;tha, a projecting rock overhanging a slab of rock,
on which are two stones set up on end. Two miles east of Mount
Stuart.
(2) Athuvisariamma, a stone enclosure, ten to fifteen feet square,
almost level with the ground. It is believed that the walls were
originally ten feet high, and that the mountain has grown up round it.
Within the enclosure there is a representation of the god. Eight miles
north of Mount Stuart.
(3) Vanathav&#257;thi. Has no shrine, but is worshipped anywhere as
an invisible god.
(4) Iyappasw&#257;mi, a stone set up beneath a teak tree, and
worshipped as a protector against various forms of sickness and
disease. In the act of worshipping, a mark is made on the stone with
ashes. Two miles and a half from Mount Stuart, on the gh&#257;t road to
S&#275;thumadai.
(5) M&#257;sany&#257;tha, a female recumbent figure in stone on a
masonry wall in an open plain near the village of &#256;naimalai,
before which trial by ordeal is carried out. The goddess has a high
repute for her power of detecting thieves or rogues. Chillies are
thrown into a fire in her name, and the guilty person suffers from
vomiting and diarrh&oelig;a.
According to Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna Iyer,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e615src" href="#xd21e615" name="xd21e615src">11 the
K&#257;dirs are &ldquo;worshippers of K&#257;li. On the occasion of
[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22]the offering to K&#257;li, a number of virgins are
asked to bathe as a preliminary to the preparation of the offering,
which consists of rice and some vegetables cooked in honey, and made
into a sweet pudding. The rice for this preparation is unhusked by
these girls. The offering is considered to be sacred, and is partaken
of by all men, women, and children assembled.&rdquo;
When K&#257;dirs fall sick, they worship the gods by saluting them
with their hands to the face, burning camphor, and offering up fruits,
cocoanuts, and betel. Mr. Vincent tells me that they have a horror of
cattle, and will not touch the ordure, or other products of the cow.
Yet they believe that their gods occasionally reside in the body of a
&ldquo;bison,&rdquo; and have been known to do p&#363;ja (worship) when
a bull has been shot by a sportsman. It is noted by Mr. Anantha Krishna
Iyer that wild elephants are held in veneration by them, but tame ones
are believed to have lost the divine element.
The K&#257;dirs are said, during the Hindu Vishu festival, to visit
the plains, and, on their way, pray to any image which they chance to
come across. They are believers in witchcraft, and attribute all
diseases to the miraculous workings thereof. They are good exorcists,
and trade in mantrav&#257;dam or magic. Mr. Logan mentions<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e624src" href="#xd21e624" name="xd21e624src">12
that &ldquo;the family of famous trackers, whose services in the
jungles were retained for H.R.H. the Prince of Wales&rsquo; (now King
Edward) projected sporting tour in the &#256;namalai mountains, dropped
off most mysteriously, one by one, shortly afterwards, stricken down by
an unseen hand, and all of them expressing beforehand their conviction
that they were under a certain individual&rsquo;s spell, and were
doomed to certain death at an early date. They <span class=
"pagenum">[23]were
probably poisoned, but how it was managed remains a mystery, although
the family was under the protection of a European gentleman, who would
at once have brought to light any ostensible foul play.&rdquo;
The K&#257;dir dead are buried in a grave, or, if death occurs in
the depths of the jungles, with a paucity of hands available for
digging, the corpse is placed in a crevice between the rocks, and
covered over with stones. The grave is dug from four to five feet deep.
There is no special burial-ground, but some spot in the jungle, not far
from the scene of death, is selected. A band of music, consisting of
drum and fife, plays weird dirges outside the hut of the deceased, and
whistles are blown when it is carried away therefrom. The old clothes
of the deceased are spread under the corpse, and a new cloth is put on
it. It is tied up in a mat, which completely covers it, and carried to
the burial-ground on a bamboo stretcher. As it leaves the hut, rice is
thrown over it. The funeral ceremony is simple in the extreme. The
corpse is laid in the grave on a mat in the recumbent posture, with the
head towards the east, and with split bamboo and leaves placed all
round it, so that not a particle of earth can touch it. No stone, or
sepulchral monument of any kind, is set up to mark the spot. The
K&#257;dir believes that the dead go to heaven, which is in the sky,
but has no views as to what sort of place it is. The story that the
K&#257;dirs eat their dead originated with Europeans, the origin of it
being that no one had ever seen a dead K&#257;dir, a grave, or sign of
a burial-place. The K&#257;dirs themselves are reticent as to their
method of disposing of the dead, and the story, which was started as a
joke, became more or less believed. Mr. Vincent tells me that a
well-to-do K&#257;dir family will perform the final death ceremonies
eight days after death, but poorer [<a id="pb24"
href="#pb24" name="pb24">24]folk have to wait a year or
more, till they have collected sufficient money for the expenses
thereof. At cock-crow on the morning of the ceremonies, rice, called
polli chor, is cooked, and piled up on leaves in the centre of the hut
of the deceased. Cooked rice, called tullagu chor, is then placed in
each of the four corners of the hut, to propitiate the gods, and to
serve as food for them and the spirit of the dead person. At a short
distance from the hut, rice, called kanal chor, is cooked for all
K&#257;dirs who have died, and been buried. The relations and friends
of the deceased commence to cry, and make lamentations, and proclaim
his good qualities, most of which are fictitious. After an hour or so,
they adjourn to the hut of the deceased, where the oldest man present
invokes the gods, and prays to them and to the heaped up food. A pinch
from each of the heaps is thrown into the air as a gift of food to the
gods, and those present fall to, and eat heartily, being careful to
partake of each of the food-stuffs, consisting of rice, meat, and
vegetables, which have been prepared.
On a certain Monday in the months of &#256;di and &#256;vani, the
K&#257;dirs observe a festival called n&#333;mbu, during which a feast
is held, after they have bathed and anointed themselves with oil. It
was, they say, observed by their ancestors, but they have no definite
tradition as to its origin or significance. It is noted by Mr. Anantha
Krishna Iyer that, at the &#332;nam festival, presents in the shape of
rice, cloths, coats, turbans, caps, ear-rings, tobacco, opium, salt,
oil and cocoanuts are distributed among the K&#257;dirs by the Forest
Department.
According to Mr. Bensley, &ldquo;the K&#257;dir has an air of calm
dignity, which leads one to suppose that he had some reason for having
a more exalted opinion of himself than that entertained for him by the
outside world. A [<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25]forest officer of a philanthropic turn had a very
high opinion of the sturdy independence and blunt honesty of the
K&#257;dir, but he once came unexpectedly round a corner, to find two
of them exploring the contents of his port-manteau, from which they had
abstracted a pair of scissors, a comb, and a looking glass.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The K&#257;dirs,&rdquo; Mr. (now Sir F. A.) Nicholson
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e640src" href="#xd21e640" name=
"xd21e640src">13 &ldquo;are, as a rule, rather short in stature,
and deep-chested, like most mountaineers; and, like many true
mountaineers, they rarely walk with a straight leg. Hence their thigh
muscles are often abnormally developed at the expense of those of the
calf. Hence, too, in part, their dislike to walking long distances on
level ground, though their objection, mentioned by Colonel Douglas
Hamilton, to carrying loads on the plains, is deeper-rooted than that
arising from mere physical disability. This objection is mainly because
they are rather a timid race, and never feel safe out of the forests.
They have also affirmed that the low-country air is very trying to
them.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, they very rarely go down to the
plains, even as far as the village of &#256;naimalai, only fifteen
miles distant from Mount Stuart. One woman, whom I saw, had been as far
as Palgh&#257;t by railway from Coimbatore, and had returned very much
up-to-date in the matter of jewelry and the latest barbarity in
imported piece-good body-cloth.
With the chest-girth of the K&#257;dirs, as well as their general
muscular development, I was very much impressed. Their hardiness, Mr.
Conner writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e645src" href="#xd21e645"
name="xd21e645src">14 has given rise to the observation among their
neighbours that the K&#257;dir and K&#257;d &#256;nai (wild elephant)
are much the same sort of animal. [<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26]
Perhaps the most interesting custom of the K&#257;dirs is that of
chipping all or some of the incisor teeth, both upper and lower, into
the form of a sharp-pointed, but not serrated cone. The operation,
which is performed with a chisel or bill-hook and file by members of
the tribe skilled therein, on boys and girls, has been thus described.
The girl to be operated on lies down, and places her head against a
female friend, who holds her head firmly. A woman takes a sharpened
bill-hook, and chips away the teeth till they are shaded to a point,
the girl operated on writhing and groaning with the pain. After the
operation she appears dazed, and in a very few hours the face begins to
swell. Swelling and pain last for a day or two, accompanied by severe
headache. The K&#257;dirs say that chipped teeth make an ugly man or
woman handsome, and that a person, whose teeth have not been thus
operated on, has teeth and eats like a cow. Whether this practice is
one which the K&#257;dir, and Mala V&#275;dar of Travancore, have hit
on spontaneously in comparatively recent times, or whether it is a
relic of a custom resorted to by their ancestors of long ago, which
remains as a stray survival of a custom once more widely practiced by
the remote inhabitants of Southern India, cannot be definitely
asserted, but I incline to the latter view.
A friendly old woman, with huge discs in the widely dilated lobes of
the ears, and a bamboo five-pronged comb in her back-hair, who acted as
spokesman on the occasion of a visit to a charmingly situated
settlement in a jungle of magnificent bamboos by the side of a mountain
stream, pointed out to me, with conscious pride, that the huts were
largely constructed by the females, while the men worked for the sircar
(Government). The females also carry water from the streams, collect
[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27]firewood, dig up edible roots, and carry out the
sundry household duties of a housewife. Both men and women are clever
at plaiting bamboo baskets, necklets, etc. I was told one morning by a
K&#257;dir man, whom I met on the road, as an important item of news,
that the women in his settlement were very busy dressing to come and
see me&mdash;an event as important to them as the dressing of a
d&eacute;butante for presentation at the Court of St. James&rsquo;.
They eventually turned up without their husbands, and evidently
regarded my methods as a huge joke organised for the amusement of
themselves and their children. The hair was neatly parted, anointed
with a liberal application of cocoanut oil, and decked with wild
flowers. Beauty spots and lines had been painted with coal-tar dyes on
the forehead, and turmeric powder freely sprinkled over the top of the
heads of the married women. Some had even discarded the ragged and
dirty cotton cloth of every-day life in favour of a colour-printed
imported s&#257;ri. One bright, good-looking young woman, who had
already been through the measuring ordeal, acted as an efficient
lady-help in coaching the novices in the assumption of the correct
positions. She very readily grasped the situation, and was manifestly
proud of her temporary elevation to the rank of standard-bearer to
Government.

Dr. K. T. Preuss has drawn my attention to an article in Globus,
1899, entitled &lsquo;Die Zauberbilder Schriften der
Negrito in Malaka,&rsquo; wherein he describes in detail the
designs on the bamboo combs worn by the Negritos of Malacca, and
compares them with the strikingly similar design on the combs worn by
the K&#257;dir women. Dr. Preuss works out in detail the theory that
the design is not, as I have elsewhere called it, a geometrical
pattern, but consists of a series of hieroglyphics. <span class=
"pagenum">[28]The
collection of K&#257;dir combs in the Madras Museum shows very clearly
that the patterns thereon are conventional designs. The bamboo combs
worn by the Semang women are stated<a class="noteref" id="xd21e667src"
href="#xd21e667" name="xd21e667src">15 to serve as talismans, to
protect them against diseases which are prevalent, or most dreaded by
them. Mr. Vincent informs me that, so far as he knows, the K&#257;dir
combs are not looked on as charms, and the markings thereon have no
mystic significance. A K&#257;dir man should always make a comb, and
present it to his intended wife just before marriage, or at the
conclusion of the marriage ceremony, and the young men vie with each
other as to who can make the nicest comb. Sometimes they represent
strange articles on the combs. Mr. Vincent has, for example, seen a
comb with a very good imitation of the face of a clock scratched on
it.
It is sometimes difficult to distinguish adolescent K&#257;dir
youths with curly fringe, chests covered by a cotton cloth, and wearing
necklets made of plaited grass or glass and brass beads, from girls.
And I was myself several times caught in an erroneous diagnosis of sex.
Many of the infants have a charm tied round the neck, which takes the
form of a dried tortoise foot; the tooth of a crocodile mimicking a
phallus, and supposed to ward off attacks from a mythical water
elephant which lives in the mountain streams; or wooden imitations of
tiger&rsquo;s claws. One baby wore a necklet made of the seeds of
Coix Lachryma-Jobi (Job&rsquo;s tears). Males
have the lobes of the ears adorned with brass ornaments, and the
nostril pierced, and plugged with wood. The ear-lobes of the females
are widely dilated with palm-leaf rolls or huge wooden discs, and they
wear ear-rings, [<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29]brass or steel bangles and finger-rings, and bead
necklets.

It is recorded by Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer that the K&#257;dirs are
attached to the R&#257;ja of Cochin &ldquo;by the strongest ties of
personal affection and regard. Whenever His Highness tours in the
forests, they follow him, carry him from place to place in manjals or
palanquins, carry s&#257;man (luggage), and in fact do everything for
him. His Highness in return is much attached to them, feeds them, gives
them cloths, ornaments, combs, and looking-glasses.&rdquo;
The K&#257;dirs will not eat with Malasars, who are beef-eaters, and
will not carry boots made of cow-hide, except under protest.
Average stature 157.7 cm.; cephalic index 72.9; nasal index 89.
Kadl&#275;.&mdash;Kadl&#275;, Kall&#275;, and Kadal&#275;
meaning Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum) have been
recorded as exogamous septs or g&#333;tras of Kurubas and Kurnis.
K&#257;du.&mdash;K&#257;du or K&#257;ttu, meaning wild or
jungle, has been recorded as a division of Golla, Irula, Korava,
Kurumba, and T&#333;ttiyan. K&#257;du also occurs as an exogamous sept
or g&#333;tra of the Kurnis. K&#257;du Konkani is stated, in the Madras
Census Report, 1901, to mean the bastard Konkanis, as opposed to the
G&#333;d or pure Konkanis. K&#257;ttu Mar&#257;thi is a synonym for the
bird-catching Kuruvikarans. In the Malabar Wynaad, the jungle Kurumbas
are known as K&#257;ttu N&#257;yakan.
K&#257;dukuttukiravar.&mdash;A synonym, meaning one who bores
a hole in the ear, for Koravas who perform the operation of piercing
the lobes of the ears for various castes. [<a id=

Kaduppattan.&mdash;The Kadupattans are said,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e709src" href="#xd21e709" name="xd21e709src">16
according to the traditional account of their origin, to have been
Pattar Br&#257;hmans of Kadu gr&#257;mam, who became degraded owing to
their supporting the introduction of Buddhism. &ldquo;The members of
this caste are,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e712src" href="#xd21e712" name="xd21e712src">17 &ldquo;at
present mostly palanquin-bearers, and carriers of salt, oil, etc. The
educated among them follow the profession of teaching, and are called
Ezhuttacchan, i.e., master of learning. Both titles are used in
the same family. In the Native State of Cochin, the Kaduppattan is a
salt-worker. In British Malabar he is not known to have followed that
profession for some generations past, but it may be that, salt
manufacture having long ago been stopped in South Malabar, he has taken
to other professions, one of which is the carriage of salt. In manners
and customs Kaduppattans resemble N&#257;yars, but their inheritance
follows the male line.&rdquo; The Kaduppattans are described<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e718src" href="#xd21e718" name="xd21e718src">18
by Mr. Logan as &ldquo;a caste hardly to be distinguished from the
N&#257;yars. They follow a modified makkatayam system of inheritance,
in which the property descends from father to son, but not from father
to daughter. The girls are married before attaining puberty, and the
bridegroom, who is to be the girl&rsquo;s real husband in after life,
arranges the dowry and other matters by means of mediators (enangan).
The t&#257;li is tied round the girl&rsquo;s neck by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sister or a female relative. At the funeral
ceremonies of this class, the barber caste perform priestly functions,
giving directions and preparing oblation rice. A widow without male
issue is removed on the twelfth day after her husband&rsquo;s death
from his house to that of her own parents. And this is done even if she
has female issue. [<a id="pb31" href="#pb31"
name="pb31">31]But, on the contrary, if she has borne sons
to the deceased, she is not only entitled to remain at her
husband&rsquo;s house, but she continues to have, in virtue of her
sons, a joint right over his property.&rdquo;
Kahar.&mdash;In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the Kahars
are returned as a Bengal caste of boatmen and fishermen. In the Mysore
Census Report, it is noted that Kahar means in Hindustani a blacksmith,
and that those censused were immigrants from the Bombay Presidency.
Kaik&#257;tti (one who shows the hand).&mdash;A division of
the Kanakkans (accountants). The name has its origin in a custom,
according to which a married woman is never allowed to communicate with
her mother-in-law except by signs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e731src"
href="#xd21e731" name="xd21e731src">19
Kaik&#333;lan.&mdash;The Kaik&#333;lans are a large caste of
Tamil weavers found in all the southern districts, who also are found
in considerable numbers in the Telugu country, where they have adopted
the Telugu language. A legend is current that the N&#257;yakkan kings
of Madura were not satisfied with the workmanship of the
Kaik&#333;lans, and sent for foreign weavers from the north
(Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans), whose descendants now far out-number the
Tamil weavers. The word Kaik&#333;lan is the Tamil equivalent of the
Sanskrit V&#299;rab&#257;hu, a mythological hero, from whom both the
Kaik&#333;lans and a section of the Paraiyans claim descent. The
Kaik&#333;lans are also called Sengundar (red dagger) in connection
with the following legend. &ldquo;The people of the earth, being
harassed by certain demons, applied to Siva for help. Siva was enraged
against the giants, and sent forth six sparks of fire from his eyes.
His wife, Parvati, was frightened, [<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32]and retired to her chamber, and,
in so doing, dropped nine beads from her anklets. Siva converted the
beads into as many females, to each of whom was born a hero with
full-grown moustaches and a dagger. These nine heroes, with Subramanya
at their head, marched in command of a large force, and destroyed the
demons. The Kaik&#333;lans or Sengundar are said to be the descendants
of Virab&#257;hu, one of these heroes. After killing the demon, the
warriors were told by Siva that they should become musicians, and adopt
a profession, which would not involve the destruction or injury of any
living creature, and, weaving being such a profession, they were
trained in it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e740src" href=
"#xd21e740" name="xd21e740src">20 According to another version,
Siva told Parvati that the world would be enveloped in darkness if he
should close his eyes. Impelled by curiosity, Parvati closed her
husband&rsquo;s eyes with her hands. Being terrified by the darkness,
Parvati ran to her chamber, and, on the way thither, nine precious
stones fell from her anklets, and turned into nine fair maidens, with
whom Siva became enamoured and embraced them. Seeing later on that they
were pregnant, Parvati uttered a curse that they should not bring forth
children formed in their wombs. One Padmasura was troubling the people
in this world, and, on their praying to Siva to help them, he told
Subramanya to kill the Asura. Parvati requested Siva not to send
Subramanya by himself, and he suggested the withdrawal of her curse.
Accordingly, the damsels gave birth to nine heroes, who, carrying red
daggers, and headed by Subramanya, went in search of the Asura, and
killed him. The word kaik&#333;l is said to refer to the ratnav&#275;l
or precious dagger carried by Subramanya. The Kaik&#333;lans, on the
Sura Samharam [<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33]day during the festival of Subramanya, dress
themselves up to represent the nine warriors, and join in the
procession.
The name Kaik&#333;lan is further derived from kai (hand), and
k&#333;l (shuttle). The Kaik&#333;lans consider the different parts of
the loom to represent various D&#275;vatas and Rishis. The thread is
said to have been originally obtained from the lotus stalk rising from
Vishnu&rsquo;s navel. Several D&#275;vas formed the threads, which make
the warp; N&#257;rada became the woof; and V&#275;damuni the treadle.
Brahma transformed himself into the plank (padamaram), and
Adis&#275;sha into the main rope.
In some places, the following sub-divisions of the caste are
recognised:&mdash;S&#333;zhia; Rattu; Siru-t&#257;li (small marriage
badge); Peru-t&#257;li (big marriage badge); Sirp&#257;dam, and
Sevaghavritti. The women of the Siru and Peru-t&#257;li divisions wear
a small and large t&#257;li respectively.
In religion, most of the Kaik&#333;lans are Saivites, and some have
taken to wearing the lingam, but a few are Vaishnavites.
The hereditary headman of the caste is called Peridanak&#257;ran or
Pattak&#257;ran, and is, as a rule, assisted by two subordinates
entitled Sengili or Gr&#257;mani, and &#362;ral. But, if the settlement
is a large one, the headman may have as many as nine assistants.
According to Mr. H. A. Stuart,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e756src"
href="#xd21e756" name="xd21e756src">21 &ldquo;the Kaik&#333;lans
acknowledge the authority of a headman, or Mah&#257;n&#257;ttan, who
resides at Conjeeveram, but itinerates among their villages, receiving
presents, and settling caste disputes. Where his decision is not
accepted without demur, he imposes upon the refractory weavers the
expense of a [<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34]curious ceremony, in which the planting of a
bamboo post takes part. From the top of this pole the
Mah&#257;n&#257;ttan pronounces his decision, which must be acquiesced
in on pain of excommunication.&rdquo; From information gathered at
Conjeeveram, I learn that there is attached to the Kaik&#333;lans a
class of mendicants called Nattukatt&#257;da N&#257;yanmar. The name
means the N&#257;yanmar who do not plant, in reference to the fact
that, when performing, they fix their bamboo pole to the g&#333;puram
of a temple, instead of planting it in the ground. They are expected to
travel about the country, and, if a caste dispute requires settlement,
a council meeting is convened, at which they must be present as the
representatives of the Mah&#257;n&#257;du, a chief Kaik&#333;lan
head-quarters at Conjeeveram. If the dispute is a complicated one, the
Nattukatt&#257;da N&#257;yanmar goes to all the Kaik&#333;lan houses,
and makes a red mark with laterite<a class="noteref" id="xd21e761src"
href="#xd21e761" name="xd21e761src">22 on the cloth in the loom,
saying &ldquo;&#256;ndvar&#257;nai,&rdquo; as signifying that it is
done by order of the headman. The Kaik&#333;lans may, after this, not
go on with their work until the dispute is settled, for the trial of
which a day is fixed. The Nattukatt&#257;da N&#257;yanmars set up on a
g&#333;puram their pole, which should have seventy-two internodes, and
measure at least as many feet. The number of internodes corresponds to
that of the n&#257;dus into which the Kaik&#333;lan community is
divided. Kam&#257;tchiamma is worshipped, and the Nattukatt&#257;da
N&#257;yanmars climb up the pole, and perform various feats. Finally,
the principal actor balances a young child in a tray on a bamboo, and,
letting go of the bamboo, catches the falling child. The origin of the
performance is said to have been as follows. The demon S&#363;ran was
troubling the D&#275;vas and men, and was [<a id=
"pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35]advised by
Karthik&#275;ya (Subramanya) and V&#299;rab&#257;hu to desist from so
doing. He paid no heed, and a fight ensued. The demon sent his son
Vajrab&#257;hu to meet the enemy, and he was slain by
V&#299;rab&#257;hu, who displayed the different parts of his body in
the following manner. The vertebral column was made to represent a
pole, round which the other bones were placed, and the guts tightly
wound round them. The connective tissues were used as ropes to support
the pole. The skull was used as a jaya-mani (conquest bell), and the
skin hoisted as a flag. The trident of V&#299;rab&#257;hu was fixed to
the top of the pole, and, standing over it, he announced his victory
over the world. The Nattukatt&#257;da N&#257;yanmars claim to be the
descendants of V&#299;rab&#257;hu. Their head-quarters are at
Conjeeveram. They are regarded as slightly inferior to the
Kaik&#333;lans, with whom ordinarily they do not intermarry. The
Kaik&#333;lans have to pay them as alms a minimum fee of four annas per
loom annually. Another class of mendicant, called Ponnambalaththar,
which is said to have sprung up recently, poses as true caste beggars
attached to the Kaik&#333;lans, from whom, as they travel about the
country, they solicit alms. Some Kaik&#333;lans gave Ontipuli as the
name of their caste beggars. The Ontipulis, however, are Nokkans
attached to the Pallis.
The Kaik&#333;lan community is, as already indicated, divided into
seventy-two n&#257;dus or d&#275;sams, viz., forty-four m&#275;l
(western) and twenty-eight k&#299;l (eastern) n&#257;dus.
Intermarriages take place between members of seventy-one of these
n&#257;dus. The great Tamil poet Ottaik&#363;ththar is said to have
belonged to the Kaik&#333;lan caste and to have sung the praises of all
castes except his own. Being angry on this account, the Kaik&#333;lans
urged him to sing in praise of them. This he consented to do,
[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36]provided that he received 1,008 human heads.
Seventy-one n&#257;dus sent the first-born sons for the sacrifice, but
one n&#257;du (Tirumarudhal) refused to send any. This refusal led to
their isolation from the rest of the community. All the n&#257;dus are
subject to the authority of four thisai n&#257;dus, and these in turn
are controlled by the mah&#257;n&#257;du at Conjeeveram, which is the
residence of the patron deity Kam&#257;tchiamman. The thisai n&#257;dus
are (1) S&#299;vap&#363;ram (Walajabad), east of Conjeeveram, where
Kam&#257;tchiamman is said to have placed Nandi as a guard; (2)
Thondip&#363;ram, where Thondi Vinayakar was stationed; (3)
Virinjip&#363;ram to the west, guarded by Subramanya; (4)
Sholingip&#363;ram to the south, watched over by Bairava. Each of the
seventy-one n&#257;dus is sub-divided into kilai gr&#257;mams (branch
villages), p&#275;r&#363;r (big) and sithur (little) gr&#257;mams. In
Tamil works relating to the Sengundar caste, Conjeeveram is said to be
the mah&#257;n&#257;du, and those belonging thereto are spoken of as
the nineteen hundred, who are entitled to respect from other
Kaik&#333;lans. Another name for Kaik&#333;lans of the
mah&#257;n&#257;du seems to be &#256;ndavar; but in practice this name
is confined to the headman of the mah&#257;n&#257;du, and members of
his family. They have the privilege of sitting at council meetings with
their backs supported by pillows, and consequently bear the title
Thindusarnd&#257;n (resting on pillows). At present there are two
sections of Kaik&#333;lans at Conjeeveram, one living at Ayyampettai,
and the other at Pillaip&#257;layam. The former claim Ayyampettai as
the mah&#257;n&#257;du, and refuse to recognise Pillaip&#257;layam,
which is in the heart of Conjeeveram, as the mah&#257;n&#257;du.
Disputes arose, and recourse was had to the Vellore Court in 1904,
where it was decided that Ayyampettai possesses no claim to be called
the mah&#257;n&#257;du. [<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37]
Many Kaik&#333;lan families have now abandoned their hereditary
employment as weavers in favour of agriculture and trade, and some of
the poorer members of the caste work as cart-drivers and coolies. At
Coimbatore some hereditary weavers have become cart-drivers, and some
cart-drivers have become weavers de necessit&eacute; in the
local jail.
In every Kaik&#333;lan family, at least one girl should be set apart
for, and dedicated to temple service. And the rule seems to be that, so
long as this girl or her descendants, born to her or adopted, continue
to live, another girl is not dedicated. But, when the line becomes
extinct, another girl must be dedicated. All the Kaik&#333;lans deny
their connection with the D&#275;va-d&#257;si (dancing-girl) caste. But
Kaik&#333;lans freely take meals in D&#257;si houses on ceremonial
occasions, and it would not be difficult to cite cases of genuine
D&#257;sis who have relationship with rich Kaik&#333;lans.
Kaik&#333;lan girls are made D&#257;sis either by regular dedication
to a temple, or by the headman tying the t&#257;li (n&#257;ttu pottu).
The latter method is at the present day adopted because it is
considered a sin to dedicate a girl to the god after she has reached
puberty, and because the securing of the requisite official certificate
for a girl to become a D&#257;si involves considerable trouble.
&ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; Mr. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e782src" href="#xd21e782" name="xd21e782src">23 &ldquo;that,
where the head of a house dies, leaving only female issue, one of the
girls is made a D&#257;si in order to allow of her working like a man
at the loom, for no woman not dedicated in this manner may do
so.&rdquo;
Of the orthodox form of ceremonial in connection with a girl&rsquo;s
initiation as a D&#257;si, the following account <span class=
"pagenum">[38]was
given by the Kaik&#333;lans of Coimbatore. The girl is taught music and
dancing. The dancing master or Nattuvan, belongs to the Kaik&#333;lan
caste, but she may be instructed in music by Br&#257;hman
Bh&#257;gavathans. At the t&#257;li-tying ceremony, which should take
place after the girl has reached puberty, she is decorated with jewels,
and made to stand on a heap of paddy (unhusked rice). A folded cloth is
held before her by two D&#257;sis, who also stand on heaps of paddy.
The girl catches hold of the cloth, and her dancing master, who is
seated behind her, grasping her legs, moves them up and down in time
with the music, which is played. In the course of the day, relations
and friends are entertained, and, in the evening, the girl, seated
astride a pony, is taken to the temple, where a new cloth for the idol,
the t&#257;li, and various articles required for doing p&#363;ja, have
been got ready. The girl is seated facing the idol, and the officiating
Br&#257;hman gives sandal and flowers to her, and ties the t&#257;li,
which has been lying at the feet of the idol, round her neck. The
t&#257;li consists of a golden disc and black beads. Betel and flowers
are then distributed among those present, and the girl is taken home
through the principal streets. She continues to learn music and
dancing, and eventually goes through a form of nuptial ceremony. The
relations are invited for an auspicious day, and the maternal uncle, or
his representative, ties a gold band on the girl&rsquo;s forehead, and,
carrying her, places her on a plank before the assembled guests. A
Br&#257;hman priest recites the mantrams, and prepares the sacred fire
(h&#333;mam). The uncle is presented with new cloths by the
girl&rsquo;s mother. For the actual nuptials a rich Br&#257;hman, if
possible, and, if not, a Br&#257;hman of more lowly status is invited.
A Br&#257;hman is called in, as he is next in importance to, and the
representative of [<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"
name="pb39">39]the idol. It is said that, when the man who
is to receive her first favours, joins the girl, a sword must be
placed, at least for a few minutes, by her side. When a D&#257;si dies,
her body is covered with a new cloth removed from the idol, and flowers
are supplied from the temple, to which she belonged. No p&#363;ja is
performed in the temple till the body is disposed of, as the idol,
being her husband, has to observe pollution.
Writing a century ago (1807) concerning the Kaik&#333;lan
D&#257;sis, Buchanan says<a class="noteref" id="xd21e794src" href=
"#xd21e794" name="xd21e794src">24 that &ldquo;these dancing women,
and their musicians, now form a separate kind of caste; and a certain
number of them are attached to every temple of any consequence. The
allowances which the musicians receive for their public duty is very
small, yet, morning and evening, they are bound to attend at the temple
to perform before the image. They must also receive every person
travelling on account of the Government, meet him at some distance from
the town, and conduct him to his quarters with music and dancing. All
the handsome girls are instructed to dance and sing, and are all
prostitutes, at least to the Br&#257;hmans. In ordinary sets they are
quite common; but, under the Company&rsquo;s government, those attached
to temples of extraordinary sanctity are reserved entirely for the use
of the native officers, who are all Br&#257;hmans, and who would turn
out from the set any girl that profaned herself by communication with
persons of low caste, or of no caste at all, such as Christians or
Mussulmans. Indeed, almost every one of these girls that is tolerably
sightly is taken by some officer of revenue for his own special use,
and is seldom permitted to go to the temple, except in his presence.
Most of these officers have [<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40]more than one wife, and the women of
the Br&#257;hmans are very beautiful; but the insipidity of their
conduct, from a total want of education or accomplishment, makes the
dancing women to be sought after by all natives with great avidity. The
Mussulman officers in particular were exceedingly attached to this kind
of company, and lavished away on these women a great part of their
incomes. The women very much regret their loss, as the Mussulmans paid
liberally, and the Br&#257;hmans durst not presume to hinder any girl
who chose, from amusing an Asoph, or any of his friends. The
Br&#257;hmans are not near so lavish of their money, especially where
it is secured by the Company&rsquo;s government, but trust to their
authority for obtaining the favour of the dancers. To my taste, nothing
can be more silly and unanimated than the dancing of the women, nor
more harsh and barbarous than their music. Some Europeans, however,
from long habit, I suppose, have taken a liking to it, and have even
been captivated by the women. Most of them I have had an opportunity of
seeing have been very ordinary in their looks, very inelegant in their
dress, and very dirty in their persons; a large proportion of them have
the itch, and a still larger proportion are most severely
diseased.&rdquo;
Though the Kaik&#333;lans are considered to belong to the left-hand
faction, D&#257;sis, except those who are specially engaged by the
B&#275;ri Chettis and Kamm&#257;lans, are placed in the right-hand
faction. Kaik&#333;lan D&#257;sis, when passing through a Kamm&#257;lan
street, stop dancing, and they will not salute Kamm&#257;lans or
B&#275;ri Chettis.
A peculiar method of selecting a bride, called siru t&#257;li kattu
(tying the small t&#257;li), is said to be in vogue among some
Kaik&#333;lans. A man, who wishes to marry his maternal uncle&rsquo;s
or paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter, has to [<a id=
"pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41]tie a t&#257;li, or
simply a bit of cloth torn from her clothing, round her neck, and
report the fact to his parents and the headman. If the girl eludes him,
he cannot claim her, but, should he succeed, she belongs to him. In
some places, the consent of the maternal uncle to a marriage is
signified by his carrying the bride in his arms to the marriage pandal
(booth). The milk-post is made of Erythrina indica. After the
t&#257;li has been tied, the bridegroom lifts the bride&rsquo;s left
leg, and places it on a grinding-stone. Widows are stated by Mr. Stuart
to be &ldquo;allowed to remarry if they have no issue, but not
otherwise; and, if the prevalent idea that a Kaik&#333;la woman is
never barren be true, this must seldom take place.&rdquo;
On the final day of the death ceremonies, a small hut is erected,
and inside it stones, brought by the barber, are set up, and offerings
made to them.
The following proverbs are current about or among the
Kaik&#333;lans:&mdash;

Narrate stories in villages where there are no
Kaik&#333;lans.
Why should a weaver have a monkey?
This, it has been suggested,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e823src"
href="#xd21e823" name="xd21e823src">25 implies that a monkey would
only damage the work.
On examining the various occupations, weaving will be found to be
the best.
A peep outside will cut out eight threads.
The person who was too lazy to weave went to the stars.
The Chetti (money-lender) decreases the money, and the weaver the
thread.
The titles of the Kaik&#333;lans are M&#363;dali and
N&#257;yanar.

[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=

Among the Kaik&#333;lan musicians, I have seen every gradation of
colour and type, from leptorhine men with fair skin and chiselled
features, to men very dark and platyrhine, with nasal index exceeding
90.
The Kaik&#333;lans take part in the annual festival at Tirupati in
honour of the goddess Gangamma. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Mr. Stuart
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e842src" href="#xd21e842" name=
"xd21e842src">26 &ldquo;distinguished from the majority of similar
festivals by a custom, which requires the people to appear in a
different disguise (v&#275;sham) every morning and evening. The
M&#257;tangi v&#275;sham of Sunday morning deserves special mention.
The devotee who consents to undergo this ceremony dances in front of an
image or representation of the goddess, and, when he is worked up to
the proper pitch of frenzy, a metal wire is passed through the middle
of his tongue. It is believed that this operation causes no pain, or
even bleeding, and the only remedy adopted is the chewing of a few
margosa (Melia Azadirachta) leaves, and some kunkumam (red
powder) of the goddess. This v&#275;sham is undertaken only by a
Kaik&#333;lan (weaver), and is performed only in two places&mdash;the
house of a certain Br&#257;hman and the Mahant&rsquo;s math. The
concluding disguise is that known as the p&#275;rant&#257;lu
v&#275;sham. P&#275;rant&#257;lu signifies the deceased married women
of a family who have died before their husbands, or, more particularly,
the most distinguished of such women. This v&#275;sham is accordingly
represented by a Kaik&#333;lan disguised as a female, who rides round
the town on a horse, and distributes to the respectable inhabitants of
the place the kunkumam, saffron paste, and flowers of the
goddess.&rdquo;
For the following account of a ceremony, which took place at
Conjeeveram in August, 1908, I am indebted <span class=
"pagenum">[43]to the
Rev. J. H. Maclean. &ldquo;On a small and very lightly built car, about
eight feet high, and running on four little wheels, an image of
K&#257;li was placed. It was then dragged by about thirty men, attached
to it by cords passed through the flesh of their backs. I saw one of
the young men two days later. Two cords had been drawn through his
flesh, about twelve inches apart. The wounds were covered over with
white stuff, said to be vib&#363;thi (sacred ashes). The festival was
organised by a class of weavers calling themselves Sankunram
(Sengundar) Mudaliars, the inhabitants of seven streets in the part of
Conjeeveram known as Pillaipalyam. The total amount spent is said to
have been Rs. 500. The people were far from clear in their account of
the meaning of the ceremony. One said it was a preventive of small-pox,
but this view did not receive general support. Most said it was simply
an old custom: what good it did they could not say. Thirty years had
elapsed since the last festival. One man said that K&#257;li had given
no commands on the subject, and that it was simply a device to make
money circulate. The festival is called P&#363;nt&#275;r (flower
car).&rdquo;
In September, 1908, an official notification was issued in the Fort
St. George Gazette to the following effect. &ldquo;Whereas it appears
that hook-swinging, dragging of cars by men harnessed to them by hooks
which pierce their sides, and similar acts are performed during the
Mariyamman festival at Samayapuram and other places in the Trichinopoly
division, Trichinopoly district, and whereas such acts are dangerous to
human life, the Governor in Council is pleased, under section 144,
sub-section (5), of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, to direct
that the order of the Sub-divisional Magistrate, dated the 7th August,
1908, prohibiting such acts, shall remain in force until further
orders.&rdquo; [<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=

It is noted by Mr. F. R. Hemingway<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e857src" href="#xd21e857" name="xd21e857src">27 that, at
Ratnagiri, in the Trichinopoly district, the Kaik&#333;lans, in

name from the fact that, when begging, they tie round their waists
strings on which crows&rsquo;, paddy birds&rsquo; (heron) feathers,
etc., are tied.
Kakka Kuravan.&mdash;A division of Kuravas of Travancore.
Kakkalan.&mdash;The Kakkalans or Kakkans are a vagrant tribe
met with in north and central Travancore, who are identical with the
Kakka Kuravans of south Travancore. There are among them four
endogamous divisions called Kavitiyan, Manipparayan, Meluttan, and
Chattaparayan, of which the two first are the most important. The
Kavitiyans are further sub-divided into Kollak Kavitiyan residing in
central Travancore, [<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"
name="pb45">45]Malay&#257;lam Kavitiyan, and P&#257;ndi
Kavitiyan or immigrants from the P&#257;ndyan country.
The Kakkalans have a legend concerning their origin to the effect
that Siva was once going about begging as a Kapaladh&#257;rin, and
arrived at a Br&#257;hman street, from which the inhabitants drove him
away. The offended god immediately reduced the village to ashes, and
the guilty villagers begged his pardon, but were reduced to the
position of the Kakkalans, and made to earn their livelihood by
begging.
The women wear iron and silver bangles, and a palunka m&#257;la or
necklace of variously coloured beads. They are tattooed, and tattooing
members of other castes is one of their occupations, which include the
following:&mdash;

Katukuttu, or boring the lobes of the ears.
Katuvaippu, or plastic operations on the ear, which N&#257;yar women
and others who wear heavy pendant ear ornaments often require.
Kainokku or palmistry, in which the women are more proficient than
the men.
Kompuvaippu, or placing the twig of a plant on any swelling of the
body, and dissipating it by blowing on it.
Taiyyal, or tailoring.
P&#257;mp&#257;tam or snake dance, in which the Kakkalans are
unrivalled.
Fortune telling.

The chief object of worship by the Kakkalans is the rising sun, to
which boiled rice is offered on Sunday. They have no temples of their
own, but stand at some distance from Hindu temples, and worship the
gods thereof. Though leading a wandering life, they try to be at home
for the Malabar new year, on which occasion they wear new clothes, and
hold a feast. They do not observe the national &#332;nam and Vishu
festivals. [<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46]
The Kakkalans are conspicuously polygamous, and some have as many as
twelve wives, who are easily supported, as they earn money by their
professional engagements. A first marriage must be celebrated on
Sunday, and the festivities last from Saturday to Monday. Subsequent
marriages may also be celebrated on Thursday. On the night of the day
before the wedding, a brother, or other near relation of the
bridegroom, places the sambandham (alliance) by bringing a fanam
(coin), material for chewing, and cooked rice to the marriage pandal
(booth). Fruit and other things are flung at him by the bride&rsquo;s
people. On the following day the bridegroom arrives at the pandal, and,
after raising the t&#257;li (marriage badge) three times towards
heaven, and, invoking a blessing from on high, ties it round the
bride&rsquo;s neck. When a girl reaches puberty, a merry celebration is
kept up for a week. The dead are buried. Inheritance is from father to
son. A childless widow is a coparcener with the brothers of the
deceased, and forfeits this right if she remarries.
Though in the presence of other castes the Kakkalans speak
Malay&#257;lam, they have a peculiar language which is used among
themselves, and is not understood by others.<a class="noteref" id=

South Canara, but also in the Telugu country.
Kalinga.&mdash;A sub-division of K&#333;matis, who
&ldquo;were formerly the inhabitants of the ancient Kalinga country.
They are considered inferior to the other sub-divisions, on account of
their eating flesh. Their titles are Subaddhi, P&#257;tro, and
Chaudari.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e973src" href="#xd21e973"
name="xd21e973src">29 In the Ganjam Manual, they are described as
&ldquo;traders and shopkeepers, principally prevalent in the Chicacole
division. The name Kling or Kaling is applied, in the Malay countries,
including the Straits Settlements, to the people of peninsular India,
who trade thither, or are settled in those regions.&rdquo; It is
recorded by Dr. N. Annandale that the phrase Orang Kling Islam
(i.e., a Muhammadan from the Madras coast) occurs in Patani
Malay.
K&#257;lingi and K&#257;linji.&mdash;There has been some
confusion, in recorded accounts, between these two classes. In the
Ganjam Manual, the K&#257;linjis are described as agriculturists in
that district, and, in the Vizagapatam Manual, the K&#257;lingas or
K&#257;lingulu are stated to be cultivators in the Vizagapatam
district, and a caste of Paiks or fighting men in Jeypore. In the
Census Report, 1891, the K&#257;lingis are said to be &ldquo;most
numerous in Ganjam, but there is a considerable number of <span class=
"pagenum">[48]them in
Vizagapatam also. The word means a native of K&#257;linga, the name of
the sea-board of the Telugu country; the word Telugu itself is supposed
by Dr. Caldwell to be a corruption of Tri-Kalinga. The three large
sub-divisions of the caste are Buragam, Kintala, and Odiya. In the
Kintala sub-division, a widow may remarry if she has no male issue, but
the remarriage of widows is not allowed in other sub-divisions. The use
of flesh and alcoholic liquor is permitted. Naidu and Chaudari are
their titles.&rdquo; Further, in the Census Report, 1901, the
K&#257;lingis are described as follows: &ldquo;A caste of temple
priests and cultivators, found mainly in Ganjam and Vizagapatam,
whither they are supposed to have been brought by the Kalinga kings to
do service in the Hindu temples, before the advent of the
Br&#257;hmans. They speak either Oriya or Telugu. They have two
sub-divisions, the Kintali K&#257;lingas, who live south of the
Langulya river, and the Buragam K&#257;lingis, who reside to the north
of it, and the customs of the two differ a great deal. There is also a
third section, called Pandiri or Bevarani, which is composed of
outcastes from the other two. Except the K&#257;lingis of Mokhalingam
in Vizagapatam,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e985src" href="#xd21e985"
name="xd21e985src">30 they have headmen called Nayakabalis or
S&#257;ntos. They also have priests called Kularazus, each of whom sees
to the spiritual needs of a definite group of villages. They are
divided into several exogamous g&#333;tras, each comprising a number of
families or vamsas, some of which, such as Arudra, a lady-bird, and
Revi-chettu, the Ficus religiosa tree, are of totemistic origin.
Each section is said to worship its totem. Marriage before puberty is
the rule, and the caste is remarkable for the proportion of its girls
under twelve years of age who are married or widowed. <span class=
"pagenum">[49]Widow
marriage is not recognised by the Buragam K&#257;lingis, but the
Kintalis freely allow it. As usual, the ceremonies at the wedding of a
widow differ from those at the marriage of a maid. Some turmeric paste
is placed on a new cloth, which is then put over a pot of water, and
the ceremony takes place near this. The binding portion of it is the
tying of a saffron-coloured string to the woman&rsquo;s wrist. The
K&#257;lingis pay special reverence to Sri Radha Krishna and Chaitanya.
Some of the caste officiate in temples, wear the sacred thread, and
call themselves Br&#257;hmans, but they are not received on terms of
equality by other Br&#257;hmans. All K&#257;lingis bury their dead, but
sr&#257;ddhas (memorial services) are performed only by the Kintali
sub-division. The Buragam K&#257;lingis do not shave their heads in
front. K&#257;lingi women wear heavy bangles of brass, silver
bell-metal and glass, extending from the wrist to the elbow. The titles
of the castes are Naidu, Nayarlu, Chowdari, Biss&#333;yi, Podh&#257;no,
Jenna, Swayi, and Naiko.&rdquo;
In the foregoing account, the Oriya-speaking K&#257;linjis, and
Telugu-speaking K&#257;lingis, are both referred to. The confusion
seems to have arisen from the fact that the K&#257;linjis are sometimes
called K&#257;lingis by other castes. The K&#257;lingis are essentially
Telugus, and are found mainly on the borderland between the districts
of Ganjam and Vizagapatam. The K&#257;linjis are, on the other hand,
Oriyas, and seem to be closely allied to the agricultural castes,
Doluva, Alia, Bosantiya, etc., like which they are mainly
agriculturists. The K&#257;linjis can be easily distinguished from the
K&#257;lingis, as the latter wear the sacred thread. The following
story is told in connection with the origin of the K&#257;linji caste.
A band of robbers was once upon a time staying in a fort near Bhattu
Kunnarade, and [<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50]molesting the people, who invited the king of Puri
to come and drive the robbers away. Among the warriors who were
recruited for this purpose, was a member of the Khondaito caste, who,
with the permission of the king, succeeded in expelling the robbers. He
was named by the people Bodo-K&#257;linja, or one having a stout heart.
He and his followers remained in the Ganjam country, and the
K&#257;linjis are their descendants. The caste is widespread in the
northern part thereof.
There do not seem to be any sub-divisions among the K&#257;linjis,
but there is a small endogamous group, called Mohiri K&#257;linji.
Mohiri is a well-known division in Ganjam, and K&#257;linjis who dwell
therein intermarry with others, and do not form a separate community.
It has been suggested that the Mohiri K&#257;linjis are Telugu
K&#257;lingis, who have settled in the Oriya country. Like other Oriya
castes, the K&#257;linjis have g&#333;tras, e.g., b&#257;no
(sun), sukro (star), sanko (conch-shell), bh&#257;go (tiger) and
n&#257;go (cobra). There is a good deal of confusion regarding the
g&#333;tras in their connection with marriage. The same g&#333;tra,
e.g., sukro, is exogamous in some places, and not so in others.
Many titles occur among the K&#257;linjis, e.g., Borado,
Bissoyi, Bariko, B&#275;hara, Dolei, Gaudo, Jenna, Moliko, Naiko,
P&#257;tro, Podh&#257;no, Pulleyi, R&#257;vuto, S&#257;nto, S&#257;vu,
Swayi, Guru. In some places, the titles are taken as representing
bamsams (or vamsams), and, as such, are exogamous. Families as a rule
refrain from marrying into families bearing the same title. For
example, a Dolei man will not marry a Dolei girl, especially if their
g&#333;tras are the same. But a Dolei may marry a Pullei, even if they
have the same g&#333;tra.
The headman of the K&#257;linjis is styled S&#257;nto, and he is
assisted by a P&#257;tro. There is also a caste messenger, <span class=
"pagenum">[51]called
Bhollobhaya. For the whole community there are said to be four
S&#257;ntos and four P&#257;tros, residing at Attagada, Chinna Kimedi,
Pedda Kimedi, and Mohiri. A man who is suffering from a wound or sore
infested by maggots is said to be excommunicated, and, when he has
recovered, to submit himself before the caste-council before he is
received back into the community.
Girls are generally married before puberty, and, if a real husband
is not forthcoming, a maid goes through a mock marriage ceremony with
her elder sister&rsquo;s husband, or some elder of the community. A
bachelor must be married to the s&#257;do (Streblus asper) tree
before he can marry a widow. The remarriage of widows (thuvathuvvi) is
freely allowed. A widow, who has a brother-in-law, may not marry anyone
else, until she has obtained a deed of separation (tsado p&#257;tro)
from him. The marriage ceremonies conform to the standard Oriya type.
In some places, the little fingers of the contracting couple are
linked, instead of their hands being tied together with thread. On the
fourth day, a Bhond&#257;ri (barber) places on the marriage dais some
beaten rice and sugar-candy, which the bride and bridegroom sell to
relations for money and grain. The proceeds of the sale are the
perquisite of the Bhond&#257;ri. On the seventh day, the bridegroom
breaks a pot on the dais, and, as he and the bride go away, the brother
of the latter throws brinjal (Solanum Melongena) fruits at
him.
The dead are as a rule cremated. On the day after death, food, made
bitter by the addition of margosa (Melia Azadirachta) leaves, is
offered. A piece of bone is carried away from the burning-ground, and
buried under a p&#299;pal (Ficus religiosa) tree. Daily, until
the tenth day, water is poured seven times over the spot <span class=
"pagenum">[52]where
the bone is buried. On the tenth day, if the deceased was an elder of
the community, the jola-jola handi ceremony is performed with a pot
riddled with holes. (See Bhond&#257;ri.)
Kalkatta.&mdash;An occupation name for stone-masons in South
Canara.
Kalkatti.&mdash;Kalkatti, denoting, it has been suggested,
those who wear glass beads, is a sub-division of Idaiyan. The
Ling&#257;yats among Badagas of the N&#299;lgiri hills are called
Kalkatti, because they hang a stone (the lingam) from their necks in a
casket. Some Irulas of the same hills are also said to go by the name
Kalkatti.
Kalla.&mdash;Recorded as a sub-division of Sh&#257;n&#257;n,
and of Idaiyans in localities where Kallans are most numerous.
Kall&#257;di.&mdash;The title of a Cheruman who performs
important duties, and becomes possessed by the spirit of the deceased,
at a Cheruman funeral.
Kall&#257;di M&#257;ngan.&mdash;A synonym of Mondi.
Kalladi Siddhan.&mdash;The name, meaning a beggar who beats
himself with a stone, of a class of Telugu mendicants, who are very
clamorous and persistent in their demands for alms. The name is applied
as a term of contempt for any obstinate and troublesome individual.
These beggars carry with them a gourd, have tortoise and cowry shells
tied on their elbows, and carry an iron rod, with which they beat an
iron ring worn on the hand. They present a very revolting spectacle, as
they smear their bodies with rice done up so as to resemble vomit, and
with the juice of the prickly-pear (Opuntia Dillenii), to make
people believe that it is blood oozing from cuts made with a knife.
They are said to be very fond of eating crows, which they catch with
nets. (See Mondi.) [<a id="pb53" href=
"#pb53" name="pb53">53]
Kallamu (threshing-floor).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Panta
Reddi.
Kallan.&mdash;Of the Kallans of the Madura district in the
early part of the last century, an excellent account was written by Mr.
T. Turnbull (1817), from which the following extract has been taken.
&ldquo;The Cullaries are said to be in general a brave people, expert
in the use of the lance and in throwing the curved stick called
vullaree taddee. This weapon is invariably in use among the generality
of this tribe; it is about 30 inches in curvature. The word Cullar is
used to express a thief of any caste, sect or country, but it will be
necessary to trace their progress to that characteristic distinction by
which this race is designated both a thief, and an inhabitant of a
certain Naud, which was not altogether exempted from paying tribute to
the sovereign of Madura. This race appears to have become hereditary
occupiers, and appropriated to themselves various Nauds in different
parts of the southern countries; in each of these territories they have
a chief among them, whose orders and directions they all must obey.
They still possess one common character, and in general are such
thieves that the name is very justly applied to them, for they seldom
allow any merchandize to pass through their hands without extorting
something from the owners, if they do not rob them altogether, and in
fact travellers, pilgrims, and Br&#257;hmans are attacked and stript of
everything they possess, and they even make no scruple to kill any
caste of people, save only the latter. In case a Br&#257;hman happens
to be killed in their attempt to plunder, when the fact is made known
to the chief, severe corporal punishment is inflicted on the criminals
and fines levied, besides exclusion from society for a period of six
months. The Maloor Vellaloor and [<a id="pb54"
href="#pb54" name="pb54">54]Serrugoody Nauds are denominated
the Keelnaud, whose inhabitants of the Cullar race are designated by
the appellation of Amblacaurs.
&ldquo;The women are inflexibly vindictive and furious on the least
injury, even on suspicion, which prompts them to the most violent
revenge without any regard to consequences. A horrible custom exists
among the females of the Colleries when a quarrel or dissension arises
between them. The insulted woman brings her child to the house of the
aggressor, and kills it at her door to avenge herself. Although her
vengeance is attended with the most cruel barbarity, she immediately
thereafter proceeds to a neighbouring village with all her goods, etc.
In this attempt she is opposed by her neighbours, which gives rise to
clamour and outrage. The complaint is then carried to the head
Amblacaur, who lays it before the elders of the village, and solicits
their interference to terminate the quarrel. In the course of this
investigation, if the husband finds that sufficient evidence has been
brought against his wife, that she had given cause for provocation and
aggression, then he proceeds unobserved by the assembly to his house,
and brings one of his children, and, in the presence of witness, kills
his child at the door of the woman who had first killed her child at
his. By this mode of proceeding he considers that he has saved himself
much trouble and expense, which would otherwise have devolved on him.
This circumstance is soon brought to the notice of the tribunal, who
proclaim that the offence committed is sufficiently avenged. But,
should this voluntary retribution of revenge not be executed by the
convicted person, the tribunal is prorogued to a limited time, fifteen
days generally. Before the expiration of that period, one of the
children of that convicted [<a id="pb55" href=
"#pb55" name="pb55">55]person must be killed. At the same
time he is to bear all expenses for providing food, etc., for the
assembly during those days.
&ldquo;A remarkable custom prevails both among the males and females
in these Nauds to have their ears bored and stretched by hanging heavy
rings made of lead so as to expand their ear-laps (lobes) down to their
shoulders. Besides this singular idea of beauty attached by them to
pendant ears, a circumstance still more remarkable is that, when
merchants or travellers pass through these Nauds, they generally take
the precaution to insure a safe transit through these territories by
counting the friendship of some individual of the Naud by payment of a
certain fee, for which he deputes a young girl to conduct the
travellers safe through the limits. This sacred guide conducts them
along with her finger to her ear. On observing this sign, no Cullary
will dare to plunder the persons so conducted. It sometimes happens, in
spite of this precaution, that attempts are made to attack the
traveller. The girl in such cases immediately tears one of her
ear-laps, and returns to spread the report, upon which the complaint is
carried before the chief and elders of the Naud, who forthwith convene
a meeting in consequence at the Mundoopoolee.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1085src" href="#xd21e1085" name="xd21e1085src">31 If the
violators are convicted, vindictive retaliation ensues. The assembly
condemns the offenders to have both their ear-laps torn in expiation of
their crime, and, if otherwise capable, they are punished by fines or
absolved by money. By this means travellers generally obtain a safe
passage through these territories. [Even at the present day, in
quarrels between women of the lower castes, long ears form a favourite
object of [<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56]attack, and lobe-tearing cases figure frequently
in police records.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1090src" href=
"#xd21e1090" name="xd21e1090src">32]
&ldquo;The Maloor Naud was originally inhabited and cultivated by
Vellaulers. At a certain period some Cullaries belonging to Vella Naud
in the Conjeeveram district proceeded thence on a hunting excursion
with weapons consisting of short hand pikes, cudgels, bludgeons, and
curved sticks for throwing, and dogs. While engaged in their sport,
they observed a peacock resist and attack one of their hounds. The
sportsmen, not a little astonished at the sight, declared that this
appeared to be a fortunate country, and its native inhabitants and
every living creature naturally possessed courage and bravery.
Preferring such a country to their Naud in Conjeeveram, they were
desirous of establishing themselves here as cultivators. To effect
this, they insinuated themselves into the favour of the Vellaulers,
and, engaging as their servants, were permitted to remain in these
parts, whither they in course of time invited their relations and
friends, and to appearance conducted themselves faithfully and
obediently to the entire satisfaction of the Vellaulers, and were
rewarded for their labour. Some time afterwards, the Vellaulers,
exercising an arbitrary sway over the Cullaries, began to inflict
condign punishment for offences and misdemeanours committed in their
service. This stirred up the wrath of the Cullaries, who gradually
acquired the superiority over their masters, and by coercive measures
impelled them to a strict observance of the following rules:&mdash;
1st.&mdash;That, if a Culler was struck by his master in such
a manner as to deprive him of a tooth, he was to pay a fine of ten
cully chuckrums (money) for the offence. [<a id=
"pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57]
2nd.&mdash;That, if a Culler happened to have one of his
ear-laps torn, the Vellauler was to pay a fine of six chuckrums.
3rd.&mdash;That if a Culler had his skull fractured, the
Vellauler was to pay thirty chuckrums, unless he preferred to have his
skull fractured in return.
4th.&mdash;That, if a Culler had his arm or leg broke, he was
then to be considered but half a man. In such case the offender was
required to grant the Culler one cullum of nunjah seed land (wet
cultivation), and two koorkums of punjah (dry cultivation), to be held
and enjoyed in perpetuity, exclusive of which the Vellauler was
required to give the Culler a doopettah (cloth) and a cloth for his
wife, twenty cullums of paddy or any other grain, and twenty chuckrums
in money for expenses.
5th.&mdash;That, if a Culler was killed, the offender was
required to pay either a fine of a hundred chuckrums, or be subject to
the vengeance of the injured party. Until either of these alternatives
was agreed to, and satisfaction afforded, the party injured was at
liberty to plunder the offender&rsquo;s property, never to be
restored.
&ldquo;By this hostile mode of conduct imposed on their masters,
together with their extravagant demands, the Vellaulers were reduced to
that dread of the Cullers as to court their favour, and became
submissive to their will and pleasure, so that in process of time the
Cullers not only reduced them to poverty, but also induced them to
abandon their villages and hereditary possessions, and to emigrate to
foreign countries. Many were even murdered in total disregard of their
former solemn promises of fidelity and attachment. Having thus
implacably got rid of their original masters and expelled them from
their Naud, they became the rulers of it, and denominated it by the
singular appellation of Tun Arrasa Naud, [<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58]signifying a forest only
known to its possessors [or tanarasu-n&#257;d, i.e., the country
governed by themselves].<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1123src" href=
"#xd21e1123" name="xd21e1123src">33 In short, these Colleries
became so formidable at length as to evince a considerable ambition,
and to set the then Government at defiance. Allagar Swamy they regarded
as the God of their immediate devotion, and, whenever their enterprizes
were attended with success, they never failed to be liberal in the
performance of certain religious ceremonies to Allagar. To this day
they invoke the name of Allagar in all what they do, and they make no
objection in contributing whatever they can when the Stalaters come to
their villages to collect money or grain for the support of the temple,
or any extraordinary ceremonies of the God. The Cullers of this Naud,
in the line of the Kurtaukles, once robbed and drove away a large herd
of cows belonging to the Prince, who, on being informed of the robbery,
and that the calves were highly distressed for want of nourishment,
ordered them to be drove out of and left with the cows, wherever they
were found. The Cullers were so exceedingly pleased with this instance
of the Kurtaukle&rsquo;s goodness and greatness of mind that they
immediately collected a thousand cows (at one cow from every house) in
the Naud as a retribution, and drove them along with the plundered
cattle to Madura. Whenever a quarrel or dispute happens among them, the
parties arrest each other in the name of the respective Amblacaurs,
whom they regard as most sacred, and they will only pay their homage to
those persons convened as arbitrators or punjayems to settle their
disputes.
&ldquo;During the feudal system that prevailed among these Colleries
for a long time, they would on no [<a id="pb59"
href="#pb59" name="pb59">59]consideration permit the then
Government to have any control or authority over them. When tribute was
demanded, the Cullers would answer with contempt: &lsquo;The heavens
supply the earth with rain, our cattle plough, and we labour to improve
and cultivate the land. While such is the case, we alone ought to enjoy
the fruits thereof. What reason is there that we should be obedient,
and pay tribute to our equal?&rsquo;
&ldquo;During the reign of Vizia Ragoonada Saitooputty<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1132src" href="#xd21e1132" name=
"xd21e1132src">34 a party of Colleries, having proceeded on a
plundering excursion into the R&#257;mn&#257;d district, carried off
two thousand of the R&#257;ja&rsquo;s own bullocks. The R&#257;ja was
so exasperated that he caused forts to be erected at five different
places in the Shevagunga and R&#257;mn&#257;d districts, and, on
pretext of establishing a good understanding with these Nauttams, he
artfully invited the principal men among them, and, having encouraged
them by repeatedly conferring marks of his favour, caused a great
number to be slain, and a number of their women to be transported to
Ramiserum, where they were branded with the marks of the pagoda, and
made Deva Dassies or dancing girls and slaves of the temple. The
present dancing girls in that celebrated island are said to be the
descendants of these women of the Culler tribe.&rdquo; In the
eighteenth century a certain Captain Rumley was sent with troops to
check the turbulent Colleries. &ldquo;He became the terror of the
Collerie Naud, and was highly respected and revered by the designation
of Rumley Swamy, under which appellation the Colleries afterwards
distinguished him.&rdquo; It is on record that, during the Trichinopoly
war, the horses of Clive and Stringer Lawrence were stolen by two
Kallan brothers. [<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60]
Tradition says that one of the rooms in Tirumala
N&#257;yakkan&rsquo;s palace at Madura &ldquo;was Tirumala&rsquo;s
sleeping apartment, and that his cot hung by long chains from hooks in
the roof. One night, says a favourite story, a Kallan made a hole in
the roof, swarmed down the chains, and stole the royal jewels. The king
promised a jaghir (grant of land) to anyone who would bring him the
thief, and the Kallan then gave himself up and claimed the reward. The
king gave him the jaghir, and then promptly had him
beheaded.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1138src" href="#xd21e1138"
name="xd21e1138src">35
By Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1144src" href=
"#xd21e1144" name="xd21e1144src">36 the Kallans are said to be
&ldquo;a middle-sized dark-skinned tribe found chiefly in the districts
of Tanjore, Trichinopoly and Madura, and in the Puduk&#333;ta
territory. The name Kallan is commonly derived from Tamil kallam, which
means theft. Mr. Nelson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1147src" href=
"#xd21e1147" name="xd21e1147src">37 expresses some doubts as to the
correctness of this derivation, but Dr. Oppert accepts it, and no other
has been suggested. The original home of the Kallans appears to have
been Tondamandalam or the Pallava country, and the head of the class,
the R&#257;ja of Puduk&#333;ta, is to this day called the Tondaman.
There are good grounds for believing that the Kallans are a branch of
the Kurumbas, who, when they found their regular occupation as soldiers
gone, &lsquo;took to maraudering, and made themselves so obnoxious by
their thefts and robberies, that the term kallan, thief, was applied,
and stuck to them as a tribal appellation.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1150src" href="#xd21e1150" name="xd21e1150src">38 The Rev. W.
Taylor, the compiler of the Catalogue Raisonn&eacute; of Oriental
Manuscripts, also identifies the Kallans with the Kurumbas, and Mr.
Nelson accepts this conclusion. In the census returns, Kurumban is
returned as one of the sub-divisions of the Kallan caste.&rsquo;
[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=

&ldquo;The Ch&#333;la country, or Tanjore,&rdquo; Mr. W. Francis
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1156src" href="#xd21e1156" name=
"xd21e1156src">39 &ldquo;seems to have been the original abode of
the Kallans before their migration to the P&#257;ndya kingdom after its
conquest by the Ch&#333;las about the eleventh century A.D. But in
Tanjore they have been greatly influenced by the numerous Br&#257;hmans
there, and have taken to shaving their heads and employing
Br&#257;hmans as priests. At their weddings also the bridegroom ties
the t&#257;li himself, while elsewhere his sister does it. Their
brethren across the border in Madura continue to merely tie their hair
in a knot, and employ their own folk to officiate as their priests.
This advance of one section will doubtless in time enhance the social
estimation of the caste as a whole.&rdquo;
It is further noted, in the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district, that
the ambitions of the Kallans have been assisted &ldquo;by their own
readiness, especially in the more advanced portions of the district, to
imitate the practices of Br&#257;hmans and Vell&#257;lans. Great
variations thus occur in their customs in different localities, and a
wide gap exists between the Kallans of this district as a whole and
those of Madura.&rdquo;
In the Manual of the Tanjore district, it is stated that
&ldquo;profitable agriculture, coupled with security of property in
land, has converted the great bulk of the Kallar and Padeiyachi classes
into a contented and industrious population. They are now too fully
occupied with agriculture, and the incidental litigation, to think of
their old lawless pursuits, even if they had an inclination to follow
them. The bulk of the ryotwari proprietors in that richly cultivated
part of the Cauvery delta which constituted the greater part of the old
t&#257;luk of Tiruv&#257;di [<a id="pb62" href=
"#pb62" name="pb62">62]are Kallars, and, as a rule, they are
a wealthy and well-to-do class. The Kallar ryots, who inhabit the
villages along the banks of the Cauvery, in their dress and appearance
generally look quite like Vell&#257;las. Some of the less romantic and
inoffensive characteristics of the Kallars in Madura and Tinnevelly are
found among the recent immigrants from the south, who are distinguished
from the older Kallar colonies by the general term Terkattiy&#257;r,
literally southerns, which includes emigrants of other castes from the
south. The Terkattiy&#257;rs are found chiefly in the parts of the
district which border on Puduk&#333;ta. Kallars of this group grow
their hair long all over the head exactly like women, and both men and
women enlarge the holes in the lobes of their ears to an extraordinary
size by inserting rolls of palm-leaf into them.&rdquo; The term
Terkattiy&#257;r is applied to Kallan, Maravan, Agamudaiyan, and other
immigrants into the Tanjore district. At Mayaveram, for example, it is
applied to Kalians, Agamudaiyans, and Valaiyans. It is noted, in the
Census Report, 1891, that Agamudaiyan and Kallan were returned as
sub-divisions of Maravans by a comparatively large number of persons.
&ldquo;Maravan is also found among the sub-divisions of Kallan, and
there can be little doubt that there is a very close connection between
Kallans, Maravans, and Agamudaiyans.&rdquo; &ldquo;The origin of the
Kallar caste,&rdquo; Mr. F. S. Mullaly writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1165src" href="#xd21e1165" name="xd21e1165src">40 &ldquo;as
also that of the Maravars and Ahambadayars, is mythologically traced to
Indra and Aghalia, the wife of Rishi Gautama. The legend is that Indra
and Rishi Gautama were, among others, rival suitors for the hand of
Aghalia. Rishi Gautama was the successful one. This so incensed Indra
that he [<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63]determined to win Aghalia at all hazards, and, by
means of a cleverly devised ruse, succeeded, and Aghalia bore him three
sons, who respectively took the names Kalla, Marava, and Ahambadya. The
three castes have the agnomen Th&#275;va or god, and claim to be
descendants of Th&#275;van (Indra).&rdquo; According to another version
of the legend &ldquo;once upon a time Rishi Gautama left his house to
go abroad on business. D&#275;vendra, taking advantage of his absence,
debauched his wife, and three children were the result. When the Rishi
returned, one of the three hid himself behind a door, and, as he thus
acted like a thief, he was henceforward called Kallan. Another got up a
tree, and was therefore called Maravan from maram, a tree, whilst the
third brazened it out and stood his ground, thus earning for himself
the name of Ahamudeiyan, or the possessor of pride. This name was
corrupted into Ahambadiyan.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1170src"
href="#xd21e1170" name="xd21e1170src">41 There is a Tamil proverb
that a Kallan may come to be a Maravan. By respectability he may
develop into an Agamudaiyan, and, by slow and small degrees, become a
Vell&#257;la, from which he may rise to be a Mudaliar.
&ldquo;The Kallans,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1175src" href="#xd21e1175" name=
"xd21e1175src">42 &ldquo;will eat flesh, excepting beef, and have
no scruples regarding the use of intoxicating liquor. They are usually
farmers or field-labourers, but many of them are employed as village or
other watchmen, and not a few depend for their subsistence upon the
proceeds of thefts and robberies. In Trichinopoly town, householders
are obliged to keep a member of the Kallan caste in their service as a
protection against the depredations of these thieves, and any refusal
to give in to this custom invariably results in loss of property. On
the other [<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64]hand, if a theft should, by any chance, be
committed in a house where a Kallan is employed, the articles stolen
will be recovered, and returned to the owner. In Madura town, I am
informed, a tax of four annas per annum is levied on houses in certain
streets by the head of the Kallan caste in return for protection
against theft.&rdquo; In the Census Report, 1901, Mr. Francis records
that &ldquo;the Kallans, Maravans, and Agamudaiyans are responsible for
a share of the crime of the southern districts, which is out of all
proportion to their strength in them. In 1897, the Inspector-General of
Prisons reported that nearly 42 per cent. of the convicts in the Madura
jail, and 30 per cent, of those in the Palamcottah jail in Tinnevelly,
belonged to one or other of these three castes. In Tinnevelly, in 1894,
131 cattle thefts were committed by men of these three castes against
47 by members of others, which is one theft to 1,497 of the population
of the three bodies against one to 37,830 of the other castes. The
statistics of their criminality in Trichinopoly and Madura were also
bad. The Kallans had until recently a regular system of blackmail,
called kudik&#257;val, under which each village paid certain fees to be
exempt from theft. The consequences of being in arrears with their
payments quickly followed in the shape of cattle thefts and
&lsquo;accidental&rsquo; fires in houses. In Madura the villagers
recently struck against this extortion. The agitation was started by a
man of the Idaiyan or shepherd caste, which naturally suffered greatly
by the system, and continued from 1893 to 1896.&rdquo; The origin of
the agitation is said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1180src" href=
"#xd21e1180" name="xd21e1180src">43 to have been the anger of
certain of the Idaiyans with a Kallan Lothario, who enticed away a
woman of their caste, and afterwards her daughter, and <span class=
"pagenum">[65]kept
both women simultaneously under his protection. The story of this
anti-Kallan agitation is told as follows in the Police Administration
Report, 1896. &ldquo;Many of the Kallans are the kavalgars of the
villages under the kaval system. Under that system the kavalgars
receive fees, and in some cases rent-free land for undertaking to
protect the property of the villagers against theft, or to restore an
equivalent in value for anything lost. The people who suffer most at
the hands of the Kallars are the shepherds (K&#333;nans or Idaiyans).
Their sheep and goats form a convenient subject for the Kallar&rsquo;s
raids. They are taken for kaval fees alleged to be overdue, and also
stolen, again to be restored on the payment of blackmail. The
anti-Kallar movement was started by a man of the shepherd caste, and
rapidly spread. Meetings of villagers were held, at which thousands
attended. They took oath on their ploughs to dispense with the services
of the Kallars; they formed funds to compensate such of them as lost
their cattle, or whose houses were burnt; they arranged for watchmen
among themselves to patrol the villages at night; they provided horns
to be sounded to carry the alarm in cases of theft from village to
village, and prescribed a regular scale of fines to be paid by those
villagers who failed to turn out on the sound of the alarm. The Kallans
in the north in many cases sold their lands, and left their villages,
but in some places they showed fight. For six months crime is said to
have ceased absolutely, and, as one deponent put it, people even left
their buckets at the wells. In one or two places the Kallans gathered
in large bodies in view to overawe the villagers, and riots followed.
In one village there were three murders, and the Kallar quarter was
destroyed by fire, but whether the fire was the work of K&#333;nans or
Kallars has never been discovered. In [<a id=
"pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66]August, large numbers of
villagers attacked the Kallars in two villages in the Dindigul
division, and burnt the Kallar quarters.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The crimes,&rdquo; Mr. F. S. Mullaly writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1189src" href="#xd21e1189" name=
"xd21e1189src">44 &ldquo;that Kallars are addicted to are dacoity
in houses or on highways, robbery, house-breaking and cattle-stealing.
They are usually armed with vellari thadis or clubs (the so-called
boomerangs) and occasionally with knives similar to those worn by the
inhabitants of the western coast. Their method of house-breaking is to
make the breach in the wall under the door. A lad of diminutive size
then creeps in, and opens the door for the elders. Jewels worn by
sleepers are seldom touched. The stolen property is hidden in
convenient places, in drains, wells, or straw stacks, and is sometimes
returned to the owner on receipt of blackmail from him called
tuppu-k&#363;li or clue hire. The women seldom join in crimes, but
assist the men in their dealings (for disposal of the stolen property)
with the Chettis.&rdquo; It is noted by the Abb&eacute; Dubois that the
Kallars &ldquo;regard a robber&rsquo;s occupation as discreditable
neither to themselves, nor to their fellow castemen, for the simple
reason that they consider robbery a duty, and a right sanctioned by
descent. If one were to ask of a Kallar to what people he belonged, he
would coolly answer, I am a robber.&rdquo;
It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that
&ldquo;dacoity of travellers at night used to be the favourite pastime
of the Kallans, and their favourite haunts the various roads leading
out of Madura, and that from Ammayan&#257;yakkan&#363;r to Periyakulam.
The method adopted consisted in threatening the driver of the cart, and
then turning the vehicle into the ditch so <span class=
"pagenum">[67]that it
upset. The unfortunate travellers were then forced by some of the gang
to sit at the side of the road, with their backs to the cart and their
faces to the ground, while their baggage was searched for valuables by
the remainder. The gangs which frequented these roads have now broken
up, and the caste has practically quitted road dacoity for the simpler,
more paying, and less risky business of stealing officials&rsquo;
office-boxes and ryots&rsquo; cattle. Cattle-theft is now the most
popular calling among them. They are clever at handling animals, and
probably the popularity of the jallikats (see Maravan) has its
origin in the demands of a life, which always included much
cattle-lifting. The stolen animals are driven great distances (as much
as 20 or 30 miles) on the night of the theft, and are then hidden for
the day either in a friend&rsquo;s house, or among hills and jungles.
The next night they are taken still further, and again hidden. Pursuit
is by this time hopeless, as the owner has no idea even in which
direction to search. He, therefore, proceeds to the nearest go-between
(these individuals are well-known to every one), and offers him a
reward if he will bring back the cattle. This reward is called
tuppu-k&#363;li, or payment for clues, and is very usually as much as
half the value of the animals stolen. The Kallan undertakes to search
for the lost bullocks, returns soon, and states that he has found them,
receives his tuppu-k&#363;li, and then tells the owner of the property
that, if he will go to a spot named, which is usually in some lonely
neighbourhood, he will find his cattle tied up there. This information
is always correct. If, on the other hand, the owner reports the theft
to the police, no Kallan will help him to recover his animals, and
these are eventually sold in other districts or Travancore, or even
sent across from Tuticorin to Ceylon. Consequently, <span class=
"pagenum">[68]hardly
any cattle-thefts are ever reported to the police. Where the Kallans
are most numerous, the fear of incendiarism induces people to try to
afford a tiled or terraced roof, instead of being content with thatch.
The cattle are always tied up in the houses at night. Fear of the
Kallans prevents them from being left in the fields, and they may be
seen coming into the villages every evening in scores, choking every
one with the dust they kick up, and polluting the village site (instead
of manuring the land) for twelve hours out of every twenty-four.
Buffaloes are tied up outside the houses. Kallans do not care to steal
them, as they are of little value, are very troublesome when a stranger
tries to handle them, and cannot travel fast or far enough to be out of
reach of detection by daybreak. The Kallans&rsquo; inveterate addiction
to dacoity and theft render the caste to this day a thorn in the flesh
of the authorities. A very large proportion of the thefts committed in
the district are attributable to them. Nor are they ashamed of the
fact. One of them defended his class by urging that every other class
stole, the official by taking bribes, the vakil (law pleader) by
fostering animosities, and so pocketing fees, the merchant by watering
the arrack (spirit) and sanding the sugar, and so on, and that the
Kallans differed from these only in the directness of their methods.
Round about M&#275;l&#363;r, the people of the caste are taking
energetically to wet cultivation, to the exclusion of cattle-lifting,
with the Periy&#257;r water, which has lately been brought there. In
some of the villages to the south of that town, they have drawn up a
formal agreement (which has been solemnly registered, and is most
rigorously enforced by the headmen), forbidding theft, recalling all
the women who have emigrated to Ceylon and elsewhere, and, with an
enlightenment which puts [<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69]other communities to shame,
prohibiting several other unwise practices which are only too common,
such as the removal from the fields of cow-dung for fuel, and the
pollution of drinking-water tanks (ponds) by stepping into them. Hard
things have been said about the Kallans, but points to their credit are
the chastity of their women, the cleanliness they observe in and around
their villages, and their marked sobriety. A toddy-shop in a Kallan
village is seldom a financial success.&rdquo;

Kallan Children with Dilated Ear-lobes.

From a recent note,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1211src" href=
"#xd21e1211" name="xd21e1211src">45 I gather the following
additional information concerning tuppu-kuli. &ldquo;The Kallans are
largely guilty of cattle-thefts. In many cases, they return the cattle
on receiving tuppu-kuli. The official returns do not show many of these
cases. No cattle-owner thinks of reporting the loss of any of his
cattle. Naturally his first instinct is that it might have strayed
away, being live property. The tuppu-kuli system generally helps the
owner to recover his lost cattle. He has only to pay half of its real
value, and, when he recovers his animal, he goes home with the belief
that he has really made a profitable bargain. There is no matter for
complaint, but, on the other hand, he is glad that he got back his
animal for use, often at the most opportune time. Cattle are
indispensable to the agriculturist at all times of the year. Perhaps,
sometimes, when the rains fail, he may not use them. But if, after a
long drought, there is a shower, immediately every agriculturist runs
to his field with his plough and cattle, and tills it. If, at such a
time, his cattle be stolen, he considers as though he were beaten on
his belly, and his means of livelihood gone. No cattle will be
available then for hire. There is nothing that he will not part
[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70]with, to get back his cattle. There is then the
nefarious system of tuppu-kuli offering itself, and he freely resorts
to it, and succeeds in getting back his lost cattle sooner or later. On
the other hand, if a complaint is made to the Village Magistrate or
Police, recovery by this channel is impossible. The tuppu-kuli agents
have their spies or informants everywhere, dogging the footsteps of the
owner of the stolen cattle, and of those who are likely to help him in
recovering it. As soon as they know the case is recorded in the Police
station, they determine not to let the animal go back to its owner at
any risk, unless some mutual friend intervenes, and works mightily for
the recovery, in which case the restoration is generally through the
pound. Such a restoration is, prim&acirc; facie,
cattle-straying, for only stray cattle are taken to the pound. This,
too, is done after a good deal of hard swearing on both sides not to
hand over the offender to the authorities.&rdquo;
In connection with the &lsquo;vellari thadi&rsquo; referred to
above, Dr. Oppert writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1221src" href=
"#xd21e1221" name="xd21e1221src">46 that &ldquo;boomerangs are used
by the Tamil Maravans and Kallans when hunting deer. The Madras Museum
collection contains three (two ivory, one wooden) from the Tanjore
armoury. In the arsenal of the Pudukk&#333;ttai R&#257;ja a stock of
wooden boomerangs is always kept. Their name in Tamil is valai tadi
(bent stick).&rdquo; Concerning these boomerangs, the Dew&#257;n of
Pudukk&#333;ttai writes to me as follows. &ldquo;The valari or valai
tadi is a short weapon, generally made of some hard-grained wood. It is
also sometimes made of iron. It is crescent-shaped, one end being
heavier than the other, and the outer edge is sharpened. Men trained in
the use of the weapon hold it by the lighter end, whirl <span class=
"pagenum">[71]it a few
times over their shoulders to give it impetus, and then hurl it with
great force against the object aimed at. It is said that there were
experts in the art of throwing the valari, who could at one stroke
despatch small game, and even man. No such experts are now forthcoming
in the State, though the instrument is reported to be occasionally used
in hunting hares, jungle fowl, etc. Its days, however, must be counted
as past. Tradition states that the instrument played a considerable
part in the Poligar wars of the last century. But it now reposes
peacefully in the households of the descendants of the rude Kallan and
Maravan warriors, who plied it with such deadly effect in the last
century, preserved as a sacred relic of a chivalric past along with
other old family weapons in their p&#363;ja room, brought out and
scraped and cleaned on occasions like the Ayudha p&#363;ja day (when
worship is paid to weapons and implements of industry), and restored to
its place of rest immediately afterwards.&rdquo;
The sub-divisions of the Kallans, which were returned in greatest
numbers at the census, 1891, were &#298;sangan&#257;du (or
Visangu-n&#257;du), Kungiliyan, M&#275;n&#257;du, N&#257;ttu,
Piramalain&#257;du, and S&#299;rukudi. In the Census Report, 1901, it
is recorded that &ldquo;in Madura the Kallans are divided into ten main
endogamous divisions<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1228src" href=
"#xd21e1228" name="xd21e1228src">47 which are territorial in
origin. These are (1) M&#275;l-n&#257;du, (2) S&#299;rukudi-n&#257;du,
(3) Vell&#363;r-n&#257;du, (4) Malla-k&#333;ttai n&#257;du, (5)
P&#257;kan&#275;ri, (6) Kandram&#257;nikkam or Kunnan-k&#333;ttai
n&#257;du, (7) Kandad&#275;vi, (8) Puramalai-n&#257;du, (9)
Tennilai-n&#257;du, and (10) P&#257;laya-n&#257;du. The headman of the
Puramalai-n&#257;du section is said to be installed by Idaiyans
(herdsmen), but what the connection between the two castes may be
[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72]is not clear. The termination n&#257;du means a
country. These sections are further divided into exogamous sections
called vaguppus. The M&#275;l-n&#257;du Kallans have three sections
called terus or streets, namely, Vadakku-teru (north street),
Kilakku-teru (east street), and T&#275;rku-teru (south street). The
S&#299;rukudi Kallans have vaguppus named after the gods specially
worshipped by each, such as &#256;ndi, Mandai, Aiyanar, and
V&#299;ram&#257;ng&#257;li. Among the Vell&#363;r-n&#257;du Kallans the
names of these sections seem merely fanciful. Some of them are
V&#275;ngai puli (cruel-handed tiger), Vekk&#257;li puli (cruel-legged
tiger), S&#257;mi puli (holy tiger), Sem puli (red tiger), Sammatti
makkal (hammer men), Tirum&#257;n (holy deer), and S&#257;yumpadai
t&#257;ngi (supporter of the vanquished army). A section of the Tanjore
Kallans names its sections from sundry high-sounding titles meaning
King of the Pallavas, King of Tanjore, conqueror of the south, mighty
ruler, and so on.&rdquo;
Portions of the Madura and Tanjore districts are divided into areas
known as n&#257;dus, a name which, as observed by Mr. Nelson, is
specially applicable to Kallan tracts. In each n&#257;du a certain
caste, called the N&#257;ttan, is the predominant factor in the
settlement of social questions which arise among the various castes
living within the n&#257;du. Round about Devakotta in the Sivaganga
zamindari there are fourteen n&#257;dus, representatives of which meet
once a year at Kandad&#275;vi, to arrange for the annual festival at
the temple dedicated to Swarnamurthi Sw&#257;mi. The four n&#257;dus
Unjanai, Sembonmari, Iravaseri, and Tennilai in the same zamindari
constitute a group, of which the last is considered the chief
n&#257;du, whereat caste questions must come up for settlement. For
marriage purposes these four n&#257;dus constitute an endogamous
section, which is sub-divided [<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73]into septs or karais. Among the
Vallambans these karais are exogamous, and run in the male line. But,
among the Kallans, the karai is recognised only in connection with
property. A certain tract of land is the property of a particular
karai, and the legal owners thereof are members of the same karai. When
the land has to be disposed of, this can only be effected with the
consent of representatives of the karai. The N&#257;ttar Kallans of
Sivaganga have exogamous septs called k&#299;lai or branches, which, as
among the Maravans, run in the female line, i.e., a child
belongs to the mother&rsquo;s, not the father&rsquo;s, sept. In some
castes, and even among Br&#257;hmans, though contrary to strict rule,
it is permissible for a man to marry his sister&rsquo;s daughter. This
is not possible among the Kallans who have k&#299;lais such as those
referred to, because the maternal uncle of a girl, the girl, and her
mother all belong to the same sept. But the children of a brother and
sister may marry, because they belong to different k&#299;lais,
i.e., those of their respective mothers.
<img src="images/diagram.png" alt=
"Example of allowable cousin-marriages." width="553" height=
"289">
In the above example, the girl Min&#257;chi may not marry Karuppan,
as both are members of the same k&#299;lai. But she ought, though he be
a mere boy, to marry R&#257;man, who belongs to a different sept.
[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74]
It is noted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1253src" href="#xd21e1253"
name="xd21e1253src">48 that, among the Sivaganga Kallans,
&ldquo;when a member of a certain k&#299;lai dies, a piece of new cloth
should be given to the other male member of the same k&#299;lai by the
heir of the deceased. The cloth thus obtained should be given to the
sister of the person obtaining it. If her brother fails to do so, her
husband will consider himself degraded, and consequently will divorce
her.&rdquo; Round about Pudukk&#333;ttai and Tanjore, the
Visangu-n&#257;du Kallans have exogamous septs called pattap&#275;ru,
and they adopt the sept name as a title, e.g., Muthu
Udaiy&#257;n, Karuppa Tondaman, etc. It is noted, in the Gazetteer of
the Tanjore district, that the sub-divisions of the Kallans are split
into groups, e.g., Onaiyan (wolfish), Singatt&#257;n
(lion-like), etc.
It is a curious fact that the Puramalai-n&#257;du Kallans practice
the rite of circumcision. The origin of this custom is uncertain, but
it has been suggested<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1264src" href=
"#xd21e1264" name="xd21e1264src">49 that it is a survival of a
forcible conversion to Muhammadanism of a section of the Kurumbas who
fled northwards on the downfall of their kingdom. At the time appointed
for the initiatory ceremony, the Kallan youth is carried on the
shoulders of his maternal uncle to a grove or plain outside the
village, where betel is distributed among those who have assembled, and
the operation is performed by a barber-surgeon. En route to the
selected site, and throughout the ceremony, the conch shell (musical
instrument) is blown. The youth is presented with new cloths. It is
noted, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that &ldquo;every
Kallan boy has a right to claim the hand of his paternal aunt&rsquo;s
daughter in marriage. This aunt bears the expenses connected with his
circumcision. Similarly, the maternal uncle pays the costs of the rites
which are [<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75]observed when a girl attains maturity, for he has
a claim on the girl as a bride for his son. The two ceremonies are
performed at one time for large batches of boys and girls. On an
auspicious day, the young people are all feasted, and dressed in their
best, and repair to a river or tank (pond). The mothers of the girls
make lamps of plantain leaves, and float them on the water, and the
boys are operated on by the local barber.&rdquo; It is stated, in the
Census Report, 1901, that the S&#299;rukudi Kallans use a t&#257;li, on
which the Muhammadan badge of a crescent and star is engraved.
In connection with marriage among the Kallans, it is noted by Mr. S.
M. Natesa Sastri<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1274src" href="#xd21e1274"
name="xd21e1274src">50 that &ldquo;at the M&#257;ttupongal feast,
towards evening, festoons of aloe fibre and cloths containing coins are
tied to the horns of bullocks and cows, and the animals are driven
through the streets with tom-tom and music. In the villages, especially
those inhabited by the Kallans in Madura and Tinnevelly, the maiden
chooses as her husband him who has safely untied and brought to her the
cloth tied to the horn of the fiercest bull. The animals are let loose
with their horns containing valuables, amidst the din of tom-tom and
harsh music, which terrifies and bewilders them. They run madly about,
and are purposely excited by the crowd. A young Kalla will declare that
he will run after such and such a bull&mdash;and this is sometimes a
risky pursuit&mdash;and recover the valuables tied to its horn. The
Kallan considers it a great disgrace to be injured while chasing the
bull.&rdquo;
A poet of the early years of the present era, quoted by Mr.
Kanakasabhai Pillai,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1279src" href=
"#xd21e1279" name="xd21e1279src">51 describes this custom as
practiced by the shepherd castes in those days. &ldquo;A <span class=
"pagenum">[76]large
area of ground is enclosed with palisades and strong fences. Into the
enclosure are brought ferocious bulls with sharpened horns. On a
spacious loft, overlooking the enclosure, stand the shepherd girls,
whom they intend to give away in marriage. The shepherd youths,
prepared for the fight, first pray to their gods, whose images are
placed under old banian or peepul trees, or at watering places. They
then deck themselves with garlands made of the bright red flowers of
the k&#257;nthal, and the purple flowers of the k&#257;ya. At a signal
given by the beating of drums, the youths leap into the enclosure, and
try to seize the bulls, which, frightened by the noise of the drums,
are now ready to charge anyone who approaches them. Each youth
approaches a bull, which he chooses to capture. But the bulls rush
furiously, with tails raised, heads bent down, and horns levelled at
their assailants. Some of the youths face the bulls boldly, and seize
their horns. Some jump aside, and take hold of their tails. The more
wary young men cling to the animals till they force them to fall on the
ground. Many a luckless youth is now thrown down. Some escape without a
scratch, while others are trampled upon or gored by the bulls. Some,
though wounded and bleeding, again spring on the bulls. A few, who
succeed in capturing the animals, are declared the victors of that
day&rsquo;s fight. The elders then announce that the bull-fight is
over. The wounded are carried out of the enclosure, and attended to
immediately, while the victors and the brides-elect repair to an
adjoining grove, and there, forming into groups, dance joyously before
preparing for their marriage.&rdquo;
In an account of marriage among the Kallans, Mr. Nelson writes that
&ldquo;the most proper alliance in the opinion of a Kallan is one
between a man and the [<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77]daughter of his father&rsquo;s sister, and,
if an individual have such a cousin, he must marry her, whatever
disparity there may be between their respective ages. A boy of fifteen
must marry such a cousin, even if she be thirty or forty years old, if
her father insists upon his so doing. Failing a cousin of this sort, he
must marry his aunt or his niece, or any near relative. If his
father&rsquo;s brother has a daughter, and insists upon him marrying
her he cannot refuse; and this whatever may be the woman&rsquo;s age.
One of the customs of the western Kallans is specially curious. It
constantly happens that a woman is the wife of ten, eight, six, or two
husbands, who are held to be the fathers jointly and severally of any
children that may be born of her body, and, still more curiously, when
the children grow up they, for some unknown reason, invariably style
themselves the children not of ten, eight or six fathers as the case
may be, but of eight and two, six and two, or four and two fathers.
When a wedding takes place, the sister of the bridegroom goes to the
house of the parents of the bride, and presents them with twenty-one
K&#257;li fanams (coins) and a cloth, and, at the same time, ties some
horse-hair round the bride&rsquo;s neck. She then brings her and her
relatives to the house of the bridegroom, where a feast is
prepared.
Sheep are killed, and stores of liquor kept ready, and all partake
of the good cheer provided. After this the bride and bridegroom are
conducted to the house of the latter, and the ceremony of an exchange
between them of vallari thadis or boomerangs is solemnly performed.
Another feast is then given in the bride&rsquo;s house, and the bride
is presented by her parents with one mark&#257;l of rice and a hen. She
then goes with her husband to his house. During the first twelve months
after marriage, it is customary for the wife&rsquo;s parents to
[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78]invite the pair to stay with them a day or two on
the occasion of any feast, and to present them on their departure with
a mark&#257;l of rice and a cock. At the time of the first Pongal feast
after the marriage, the presents customarily given to the son-in-law
are five mark&#257;ls of rice, five loads of pots and pans, five
bunches of plantains, five cocoanuts, and five lumps of jaggery (crude
sugar). A divorce is easily obtained on either side. A husband
dissatisfied with his wife can send her away if he be willing at the
same time to give her half of his property, and a wife can leave her
husband at will upon forfeiture of forty-two K&#257;li fanams. A widow
may marry any man she fancies, if she can induce him to make her a
present of ten fanams.&rdquo;
In connection with the foregoing account, I am informed that, among
the N&#257;ttar Kallans, the brother of a married woman must give her
annually at Pongal a present of rice, a goat, and a cloth until her
death. The custom of exchanging boomerangs appears to be fast becoming
a tradition. But, there is a common saying still current &ldquo;Send
the valari tadi, and bring the bride.&rdquo; As regards the horse-hair,
which is mentioned as being tied round the bride&rsquo;s neck, I gather
that, as a rule, the t&#257;li is suspended from a cotton thread, and
the horse-hair necklet may be worn by girls prior to puberty and
marriage, and by widows. This form of necklet is also worn by females
of other castes, such as Maravans, Valaiyans, and Morasa Paraiyans.
Puramalai Kallan women can be distinguished by the triangular ornament,
which is attached to the t&#257;li string. It is stated, in the
Gazetteer of the Madura district, that &ldquo;when a girl has attained
maturity, she puts away the necklace of coloured beads she wore as a
child, and dons the horse-hair necklet, which is characteristic of the
Kallan woman. This [<a id="pb79" href="#pb79"
name="pb79">79]she retains till death, even if she becomes a
widow. The richer Kallans substitute for the horse-hair a necklace of
many strands of fine silver wire. In Tirumangalam, the women often hang
round their necks a most curious brass and silver pendant, six or eight
inches long, and elaborately worked.&rdquo;
It is noted in the Census Report, 1891, that as a token of divorce
&ldquo;a Kallan gives his wife a piece of straw in the presence of his
caste people. In Tamil the expression &lsquo;to give a straw&rsquo;
means to divorce, and &lsquo;to take a straw&rsquo; means to accept
divorce.&rdquo;
In their marriage customs, some Kallans have adopted the
Pur&#257;nic form of rite owing to the influence of Br&#257;hman
pur&#333;hits, and, though adult marriage is the rule, some
Br&#257;hmanised Kallans have introduced infant marriage. To this the
Puramalai section has a strong objection, as, from the time of
marriage, they have to give annually till the birth of the first child
a present of fowls, rice, a goat, jaggery, plantains, betel, turmeric,
and condiments. By adult marriage the time during which this present
has to be made is shortened, and less expenditure thereon is incurred.
In connection with the marriage ceremonies as carried out by some
Kallans, I gather that the consent of the maternal uncle of a girl to
her marriage is essential. For the betrothal ceremony, the father and
maternal uncle of the future bridegroom proceed to the girl&rsquo;s
house, where a feast is held, and the date fixed for the wedding
written on two rolls of palm leaf dyed with turmeric or red paper,
which are exchanged between the maternal uncles. On the wedding day,
the sister of the bridegroom goes to the house of the bride,
accompanied by women, some of whom carry flowers, cocoanuts, betel
leaves, turmeric, leafy twigs of Sesbania
grandiflora, [<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80]paddy (unhusked rice), milk, and gh&#299;
(clarified butter). A basket containing a female cloth, and the
t&#257;li string wrapped up in a red cloth borrowed from a washerman,
is given to a sister of the bridegroom or to a woman belonging to his
sept. On the way to the bride&rsquo;s house, two of the women blow
chank shells (musical instrument). The bride&rsquo;s people question
the bridegroom&rsquo;s party as to his sept, and they ought to say that
he belongs to Indra k&#363;lam, Thalavala n&#257;du, and Ahalya
g&#333;tra. The bridegroom&rsquo;s sister, taking up the t&#257;li,
passes it round to be touched by all present, and ties the string,
which is decorated with flowers, tightly round the bride&rsquo;s neck
amid the blowing of the conch shell. The bride is then conducted to the
home of the bridegroom, whence they return to her house on the
following day. The newly married couple sit on a plank, and coloured
rice-balls or coloured water are waved, while women yell out
&ldquo;killa, illa, illa; killa, illa, illa.&rdquo; This ceremony is
called kulavi idal, and is sometimes performed by Kallan women during
the t&#257;li-tying.
The following details relating to the marriage ceremonies are
recorded in the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district. &ldquo;The arrival
of the bridegroom has been described as being sometimes especially
ceremonious. Mounted on a horse, and attended by his maternal uncle, he
is met by a youth from the bride&rsquo;s house, also mounted, who
conducts the visitors to the marriage booth. Here he is given betel
leaves, areca nuts, and a rupee by the bride&rsquo;s father, and his
feet are washed in milk and water, and adorned with toe-rings by the
bride&rsquo;s mother. The t&#257;li is suspended from a necklet of gold
or silver instead of cotton thread, but this is afterwards changed to
cotton for fear of offending the god Karuppan. A lamp is often held by
the bridegroom&rsquo;s sister, or some [<a id=
"pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81]married woman, while the
t&#257;li is being tied. This is left unlighted by the Kallans for fear
it should go out, and thus cause an evil omen. The marriage tie is in
some localities very loose. Even a woman who has borne her husband many
children may leave him if she likes, to seek a second husband, on
condition that she pays him her marriage expenses. In this case (as
also when widows are remarried), the children are left in the late
husband&rsquo;s house. The freedom of the Kallan women in these matters
is noticed in the proverb that, &ldquo;though there may be no thread in
the spinning-rod, there will always be a (t&#257;li) thread on the neck
of a Kallan woman,&rdquo; or that &ldquo;though other threads fail, the
thread of a Kallan woman will never do so.&rdquo;
By some Kallans pollution is, on the occasion of the first menstrual
period, observed for seven or nine days. On the sixteenth day, the
maternal uncle of the girl brings a sheep or goat, and rice. She is
bathed and decorated, and sits on a plank while a vessel of water,
coloured rice, and a measure filled with paddy with a style bearing a
betel leaf struck on it, are waved before her. Her head, knees, and
shoulders are touched with cakes, which are then thrown away. A woman,
conducting the girl round the plank, pours water from a vessel on to a
betel leaf held in her hand, so that it falls on the ground at the four
cardinal points of the compass, which the girl salutes.
A ceremony is generally celebrated in the seventh month of
pregnancy, for which the husband&rsquo;s sister prepares pongal (cooked
rice). The pregnant woman sits on a plank, and the rice is waved before
her. She then stands up, and bends down while her sister-in-law pours
milk from a betel or p&#299;pal (Ficus religiosa) leaf on her
back. A feast brings the ceremony to a close. Among <span class=
"pagenum">[82]the
Vell&#363;r-n&#257;du Kallans patterns are said<a class="noteref" id=
"n84.1src" href="#n84.1" name="n84.1src">52 to be drawn on the back
of the pregnant woman with rice-flour, and milk is poured over them.
The husband&rsquo;s sister decorates a grindstone in the same way,
invokes a blessing on the woman, and expresses a hope that she may have
a male child as strong as a stone.
When a child is born in a family, the entire family observes
pollution for thirty days, during which entrance into a temple is
forbidden. Among the N&#257;ttar Kallans, children are said to be named
at any time after they are a month old. But, among the Puramalai
Kallans, a first-born female child is named on the seventh day, after
the ear-boring ceremony has been performed. &ldquo;All Kallans,&rdquo;
Mr. Francis writes,52
&ldquo;put on sacred ashes, the usual mark of a Saivite, on festive
occasions, but they are nevertheless generally Vaishnavites. The dead
are usually buried, and it is said that, at funerals, cheroots are
handed round, which those present smoke while the ceremony
proceeds.&rdquo; Some Kallans are said,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1327src" href="#xd21e1327" name="xd21e1327src">53 when a
death occurs in a family, to put a pot filled with dung or water, a
broomstick, and a fire-brand at some place where three roads meet, or
in front of the house, in order to prevent the ghost from
returning.
It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that
&ldquo;the Kiln&#257;d Kallans usually bury their dead. Lamps are
periodically lighted on the tomb, and it is whitewashed annually. The
Piramalain&#257;d division usually burn the dead. If a woman dies when
with child, the baby is taken out, and placed alongside her on the
pyre. This, it may be noted, is the rule with most castes in this
district, and, in some communities, the relations afterwards put up a
stone burden-rest by the side of a [<a id="pb83"
href="#pb83" name="pb83">83]road, the idea being that the
woman died with her burden, and so her spirit rejoices to see others
lightened of theirs. Tradition says that the caste came originally from
the north. The dead are buried with their faces laid in that direction;
and, when p&#363;ja is done to Karuppanasw&#257;mi, the caste god, the
worshippers turn to the north.&rdquo;
According to Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1336src"
href="#xd21e1336" name="xd21e1336src">54 &ldquo;the Kallans are
nominally Saivites, but in reality the essence of their religious
belief is devil-worship. Their chief deity is Alagarsw&#257;mi, the god
of the great Alagar K&#333;vil twelve miles to the north of the town of
Madura. To this temple they make large offerings, and the Sw&#257;mi,
called Kalla Alagar, has always been regarded as their own peculiar
deity.&rdquo; The Kallans are said by Mr. Mullaly to observe omens, and
consult their household gods before starting on depredations.
&ldquo;Two flowers, the one red and the other white, are placed before
the idol, a symbol of their god Kalla Alagar. The white flower is the
emblem of success. A child of tender years is told to pluck a petal of
one of the two flowers, and the undertaking rests upon the choice made
by the child.&rdquo; In like manner, when a marriage is contemplated
among the Idaiyans, the parents of the prospective bride and bridegroom
go to the temple, and throw before the idol a red and white flower,
each wrapped in a betel leaf. A small child is then told to pick up one
of the leaves. If the one selected contains the white flower, it is
considered auspicious, and the marriage will take place.
In connection with the Alagar K&#333;vil, I gather<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1341src" href="#xd21e1341" name="xd21e1341src">55 that,
when oaths are to be taken, the person who is to swear is asked to
worship Kallar Alagar, and, with [<a id="pb84"
href="#pb84" name="pb84">84]a parivattam (cloth worn as a
mark of respect in the presence of the god) on his head, and a garland
round his neck, should stand on the eighteenth step of the eighteen
steps of Karuppanasw&#257;mi, and say: &ldquo;I swear before Kallar
Alagar and Karuppannasw&#257;mi that I have acted rightly, and so on.
If the person swears falsely, he dies on the third day; if truly the
other person meets with the same fate.&rdquo;
It was noted by Mr. M. J. Walhouse,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1348src" href="#xd21e1348" name="xd21e1348src">56 that
&ldquo;at the bull games (jellikattu) at Dindigul, the Kallans can
alone officiate as priests, and consult the presiding deity. On this
occasion they hold quite a Saturnalia of lordship and arrogance over
the Br&#257;hmans.&rdquo; It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the
Madura district, that &ldquo;the keenness of the more virile sections
of the community (especially the Kallans), in this game, is
extraordinary, and, in many villages, cattle are bred and reared
specially for it. The best jallikats are to be seen in the Kallan
country in Tirumangalam, and next come those in M&#275;l&#363;r and
Madura t&#257;luks.&rdquo; (See also Maravan.)
It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that
Karuppan is &ldquo;essentially the god of the Kallans, especially of
the Kallans of the M&#275;l&#363;r side. In those parts, his shrine is
usually the Kallans&rsquo; ch&#257;vadi (assembly place). His priests
are usually Kallans or Kusavans. Alagarsw&#257;mi (the beautiful god)
is held in special veneration by the Kallans, and is often popularly
called the Kallar Alagar. The men of this caste have the right to drag
his car at the car festival, and, when he goes (from Alagar K&#333;vil)
on his visit to Madura, he is dressed as a Kallan, exhibits the long
ears characteristic of that caste, and carries the boomerang and club,
which [<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85]were of their old favourite weapons. It is
whispered that Kallan dacoits invoke his aid when they are setting out
on marauding expeditions, and, if they are successful therein, put part
of their ill-gotten gains into the offertory (undial) box, which is
kept at his shrine.&rdquo;
For the following note I am indebted to the Rev. J. Sharrock.
&ldquo;The chief temple of the Kallans is about ten miles west of
Madura, and is dedicated to Alagarsw&#257;mi, said to be an incarnation
of Vishnu, but also said to be the brother of M&#299;n&#257;tchi (the
fish-eyed or beautiful daughter of the P&#257;ndya king of Madura). Now
M&#299;n&#257;tchi has been married by the Br&#257;hmans to Siva, and
so we see Hinduism wedded to Dravidianism, and the spirit of
compromise, the chief method of conversion adopted by the
Br&#257;hmans, carried to its utmost limit. At the great annual
festival, the idol of Alagarsw&#257;mi is carried, in the month of
Chittra (April-May), to the temple of M&#299;n&#257;tchi, and the banks
of the river Vaiga swarm with two to three lakhs<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1360src" href="#xd21e1360" name="xd21e1360src">57 of
worshippers, a large proportion of whom are Kallans. At this festival,
the Kallans have the right of dragging with a rope the car of
Alagarsw&#257;mi, though other people may join in later on. As
Alagarsw&#257;mi is a vegetarian, no blood sacrifice is offered to him.
This is probably due to the influence of Br&#257;hmanism, for, in their
ordinary ceremonies, the Kallans invariably slaughter sheep as
sacrifices to propitiate their deities. True to their bold and thievish
instincts, the Kallans do not hesitate to steal a god, if they think he
will be of use to them in their predatory excursions,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1363src" href="#xd21e1363" name="xd21e1363src">58 and are
not afraid to dig up the coins or jewels that are generally buried
under an idol. Though they entertain little dread of their <span class=
"pagenum">[86]own
village gods, they are often afraid of others that they meet far from
home, or in the jungles when they are engaged in one of their stealing
expeditions. As regards their own village gods, there is a sort of
understanding that, if they help them in their thefts, they are to have
a fair share of the spoil, and, on the principle of honesty among
thieves, the bargain is always kept. At the annual festival for the
village deities, each family sacrifices a sheep, and the head of the
victim is given to the p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest), while the body is
taken home by the donor, and partaken of as a communion feast. Two at
least of the elements of totem worship appear here: there is the
shedding of the sacrificial blood of an innocent victim to appease the
wrath of the totem god, and the common feasting together which follows
it. The Br&#257;hmans sometimes join in these sacrifices, but of course
take no part of the victim, the whole being the perquisite of the
p&#363;j&#257;ri, and there is no common participation in the meal.
When strange deities are met with by the Kallans on their thieving
expeditions, it is usual to make a vow that, if the adventure turns out
well, part of the spoil shall next day be left at the shrine of the
god, or be handed over to the p&#363;j&#257;ri of that particular
deity. They are afraid that, if this precaution be not taken, the god
may make them blind, or cause them to be discovered, or may go so far
as to knock them down, and leave them to bleed to death. If they have
seen the deity, or been particularly frightened or otherwise specially
affected by these unknown gods, instead of leaving a part of the body,
they adopt a more thorough method of satisfying the same. After a few
days they return at midnight to make a special sacrifice, which of
course is conducted by the particular p&#363;j&#257;ri, whose god is to
be appeased. They bring a sheep with rice, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87]curry-stuffs and liquors, and, after the
sacrifice, give a considerable share of these dainties, together with
the animal&rsquo;s head, to the p&#363;j&#257;ri, as well as a sum of
money for making the p&#363;ja (worship) for them. Some of the
ceremonies are worth recording. First the idol is washed in water, and
a sandal spot is put on the forehead in the case of male deities, and a
kunkuma spot in the case of females. Garlands are placed round the
neck, and the bell is rung, while lamps are lighted all about. Then the
deity&rsquo;s name is repeatedly invoked, accompanied by beating on the
udukku. This is a small drum which tapers to a narrow waist in the
middle, and is held in the left hand of the p&#363;j&#257;ri with one
end close to his left ear, while he taps on it with the fingers of his
right hand. Not only is this primitive music pleasing to the ears of
his barbarous audience, but, what is more important, it conveys the
oracular communications of the god himself. By means of the end of the
drum placed close to his ear, the p&#363;j&#257;ri is enabled to hear
what the god has to say of the predatory excursion which has taken
place, and the p&#363;j&#257;ri (who, like a clever gypsy, has taken
care previously to get as much information of what has happened as
possible) retails all that has occurred during the exploit to his
wondering devotees. In case his information is incomplete, he is easily
able to find out, by a few leading questions and a little
cross-examination of these ignorant people, all that he needs to
impress them with the idea that the god knows all about their
transactions, having been present at their plundering bout. At all such
sacrifices, it is a common custom to pour a little water over the
sheep, to see if it will shake itself, this being invariably a sign of
the deity&rsquo;s acceptance of the animal offered. In some sacrifices,
if the sheep does not shake [<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88]itself, it is rejected, and another
substituted for it; and, in some cases (be it whispered, when the
p&#363;j&#257;ri thinks the sheep too thin and scraggy), he pours over
it only a little water, and so demands another animal. If, however, the
p&#363;j&#257;ri, as the god&rsquo;s representative, is satisfied, he
goes on pouring more and more water till the half-drenched animal has
to shake itself, and so signs its own death-warrant. All who have
ventured forth in the night to take part in the sacrifice then join
together in the communal meal. An illustration of the value of
sacrifices may here be quoted, to show how little value may be attached
to an oath made in the presence of a god. Some pannaik&#257;rans
(servants) of a Kallan land-owner one day stole a sheep, for which they
were brought up before the village munsif. When they denied the theft,
the munsif took them to their village god, Karuppan (the black
brother), and made them swear in its presence. They perjured themselves
again, and were let off. Their master quietly questioned them
afterwards, asking them how they dared swear so falsely before their
own god, and to this they replied &lsquo;While we were swearing, we
were mentally offering a sacrifice to him of a sheep&rsquo; (which they
subsequently carried out), to pacify him for the double crime of
stealing and perjury.&rdquo;
As a typical example of devil worship, the practice of the Valaiyans
and Kallans of Orattan&#257;du in the Tanjore district is described by
Mr. F. R. Hemingway.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1374src" href=
"#xd21e1374" name="xd21e1374src">59 &ldquo;Valaiyan houses have
generally an odiyan (Odina Wodier) tree in the backyard, wherein
the devils are believed to live, and among Kallans every street has a
tree for their accommodation. They are propitiated <span class=
"pagenum">[89]at least
once a year, the more virulent under the tree itself, and the rest in
the house, generally on a Friday or Monday. Kallans attach importance
to Friday in &#256;di (July and August), the cattle Pongal day in Tai
(January and February), and Kartigai day in the month Kartigai
(November and December). A man, with his mouth covered with a cloth to
indicate silence and purity, cooks rice in the backyard, and pours it
out in front of the tree, mixed with milk and jaggery (crude sugar).
Cocoanuts and toddy are also placed there. These are offered to the
devils, represented in the form of bricks or mud images placed at the
foot of the tree, and camphor is set alight. A sheep is then brought
and slaughtered, and the devils are supposed to spring one after
another from the tree into one of the bystanders. This man then becomes
filled with the divine afflatus, works himself up into a kind of
frenzy, becomes the mouthpiece of the spirits, pronounces their
satisfaction or the reverse at the offerings, and gives utterance to
cryptic phrases, which are held to foretell good or evil fortune to
those in answer to whom they are made. When all the devils in turn have
spoken and vanished, the man recovers his senses. The devils are
worshipped in the same way in the houses, except that no blood is shed.
All alike are propitiated by animal sacrifices.&rdquo;
The Kallans are stated by Mr. Hemingway to be very fond of
bull-baiting. This is of two kinds. The first resembles the game played
by other castes, except that the Kallans train their animals for the
sport, and have regular meetings, at which all the villagers
congregate. These begin at Pongal, and go on till the end of May. The
sport is called tolu m&#257;du (byre bull). The best animals for it are
the Pulikkolam bulls from the [<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90]Madura district. The other game is
called p&#257;chal m&#257;du (leaping bull). In this, the animals are
tethered to a long rope, and the object of the competition is to throw
the animal, and keep it down. A bull which is good at the game, and
difficult to throw, fetches a very high price.
It is noted in the Gazetteer of the Tanjore district, that
&ldquo;the Kallans have village caste panchayats (councils) of the
usual kind, but in some places they are discontinuing these in
imitation of the Vell&#257;lans. According to the account given at
Orattan&#257;du, the members of Ambalak&#257;ran families sit by
hereditary right as K&#257;ryastans or advisers to the headman in each
village. One of these households is considered superior to the others,
and one of its members is the headman (Ambalak&#257;ran) proper. The
headmen of the panchayats of villages which adjoin meet to form a
further panchayat to decide on matters common to them generally. In
Kallan villages, the Kallan headman often decides disputes between
members of other lower castes, and inflicts fines on the party at
fault.&rdquo;
In the Gazetteer, of the Madura district, it is recorded that
&ldquo;the organization of the Kiln&#257;d Kallans differs from that of
their brethren beyond the hills. Among the former, an hereditary
headman, called the Ambalak&#257;ran, rules in almost every village. He
receives small fees at domestic ceremonies, is entitled to the first
betel and nut, and settles caste disputes. Fines inflicted are credited
to the caste fund. The western Kallans are under a more monarchial
rule, an hereditary headman called Tirumala Pinnai T&#275;van deciding
most caste matters. He is said to get this hereditary name from the
fact that his ancestor was appointed (with three co-adjutors) by King
Tirumala N&#257;yakkan, and given [<a id="pb91"
href="#pb91" name="pb91">91]many insignia of office
including a state palanquin. If any one declines to abide by his
decision, excommunication is pronounced by the ceremony of
&lsquo;placing the thorn,&rsquo; which consists in laying a thorny
branch across the threshold of the recalcitrant party&rsquo;s house, to
signify that, for his contumacy, his property will go to ruin and be
overrun with jungle. The removal of the thorn, and the restitution of
the sinner to Kallan society can only be procured by abject apologies
to Pinnai T&#275;van.&rdquo;
The usual title of the Kallans is Ambalak&#257;ran (president of an
assembly), but some, like the Maravans and Agamudaiyans, style
themselves T&#275;van (god) or S&#275;rvaikk&#257;ran
(commander).<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1395src" href="#xd21e1395"

Kallan M&#363;ppan.&mdash;In the Madras Census Report, 1901,
Kallan M&#363;ppan is returned as &ldquo;a sub-caste of the Malabar
Kamm&#257;lans, the members of which are stone-workers.&rdquo; A
correspondent writes to me that, &ldquo;while the Kamm&#257;lans are a
polluting and polyandrous class, the Kallan M&#363;ppans are allowed to
enter the outside enclosure of temples. They do not remarry their
widows, and are strictly monogamous. Their pur&#333;hits are Tamil
barbers, who officiate at their marriages. The barber shaves the
bridegroom before the wedding ceremony. The pur&#333;hit has also to
blow the conch-shell all the way from the bridegroom&rsquo;s house to
that of the bride.&rdquo; [<a id="pb92" href=

The names Kallan and Kalk&#333;tti are also those by which the
Malabar stone-masons are known.
Kallangi.&mdash;Kallangi and Kallav&#275;li (Kallan&rsquo;s
fence) are fanciful names, returned by Pallis at times of census.
Kallas&#257;ri (stone-workers).&mdash;The occupational name
of a sub-division of Malay&#257;lam Kamm&#257;lans.
Kall&#257;takurup.&mdash;A sub-division of Ambalav&#257;sis,
who sing in Bhagavati temples. They play on a stringed instrument,
called nandurini, with two strings and a number of wooden stops glued
on to the long handle, and a wooden plectrum.
Kallu (stone).&mdash;A sub-division of G&#257;niga and
Odd&#275;. Kallukoti (stone-mason) is a sub-division of Malabar
Kamm&#257;lans, who work in stone.
Kallukatti.&mdash;It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the South
Canara district, that &ldquo;a grinding stone made of granite is an
article peculiar to South Canara. It is a semicircular, oval-shaped
block with a flat bottom, and a round hole in the middle of the
surface. It has another oval-shaped block, thin and long, with one end
so shaped as to fit into the hole in the larger block. These two
together make what is known as the grinding-stone of the district,
which is used for grinding curry-stuff, rice, wheat, etc. Mill-stones
for pounding grain are also made of granite. Formerly, a class of
people called Kallukattis used to make such articles, but the industry
is now taken up by other castes as well. Mile-stones, slabs for temple
door-frames, idols and other figures for temple purposes are also made
of granite.&rdquo;
Kall&#363;r.&mdash;Recorded, in the Travancore Census Report,
1901, as a name for the Pulikkappanikkan sub-division of
N&#257;yar.
Kall&#363;ri (stone village).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
M&#275;dara. [<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=

Kal Tacchan (stone-mason).&mdash;A sub-division of
Kamm&#257;lan.
Kalti (expunged).&mdash;A degraded Paraiyan is known as a
Kalti. Amongst the Paraiyans of Madras, Chingleput and North Arcot, the
rule is that a man who does not abide by the customs of the caste is
formally excommunicated by a caste council. He then joins &ldquo;those
at Vinnamangalam&rdquo; near Vellore, i.e., those who have, like
himself, been driven out of the caste.
Kalugun&#257;du (eagle&rsquo;s country).&mdash;An exogamous
sept of Tamil goldsmiths in the Madura district.
Kaluthai (possessors of donkeys).&mdash;A sub-division of
Odd&#275;.
Kaly&#257;nakulam (marriage people).&mdash;A fanciful name
returned by some Mangalas at times of census, as they officiate as
musicians at marriages.
Kamadi (tortoise).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Kurni.
K&#257;m&#257;kshiamma.&mdash;Recorded, in the North Arcot
Manual, as a sub-division of V&#257;niyan. K&#257;m&#257;kshiamma is
the chief goddess worshipped at Conjeeveram. She and M&#299;n&#257;kshi
Amma of Madura are two well-known goddesses worshipped by Saivites.
Both names are synonyms of Parvati, the wife of Siva.
K&#257;m&#257;ti (foolish).&mdash;A name sometimes applied to
carpenters, and also of a sub-division of Okkiliyans, who are said to
have abandoned their original occupation of cultivating land, and
become bricklayers.
Kambalam.&mdash;The name Kambalam is applied to a group of
nine castes (Tottiyan, Annappan, K&#257;ppiliyan, Chakkiliyan, etc.),
because at their council meetings a blanket (kambli) is spread, on
which is placed a brass vessel (kalasam) filled with water, and
decorated with flowers. (See Tottiyan.)
Kambalatt&#257;n.&mdash;A synonym of Tottiyan. <span class=
"pagenum">[94]
Kamban.&mdash;A title of the &#332;cchans, to which caste the
great Tamil epic poet Kamban is reputed to have belonged.
Kambha.&mdash;Kambha or Kambh&#257;pu, meaning a pillar or
post, has been recorded as an exogamous sept of M&#257;diga and
K&#333;mati.
Kamma.&mdash;Writing collectively concerning the Kammas,
K&#257;pus or Reddis, Velamas, and Telagas, Mr. W. Francis
states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1499src" href="#xd21e1499" name=
"xd21e1499src">61 that &ldquo;all four of these large castes
closely resemble one another in appearance and customs, and seem to
have branched off from one and the same Dravidian stock. Originally
soldiers by profession, they are now mainly agriculturists and traders,
and some of them in the north are zamindars (land-owners). The
R&#257;zus, who now claim to be Kshatriyas, were probably descended
from K&#257;pus, Kammas, and Velamas. The Kammas and K&#257;pus of the
Madura and Tinnevelly districts seem to have followed the Vijayanagar
army south, and settled in these districts when the N&#257;yak
Governors were established there. Their women are less strict in their
deportment than those of the same castes further north, the latter of
whom are very careful of their reputations, and, in the case of one
section of the Kammas, are actually g&#333;sha (kept in seclusion) like
Musalm&#257;nis.&rdquo;
Various stories are current, which point to the common ancestry of
the Kammas, K&#257;pus, and Velamas. The word Kamma in Telugu means the
ear-ornament, such as is worn by women. According to one legend
&ldquo;the Rishis, being troubled by R&#257;kshasas, applied to Vishnu
for protection, and he referred them to Lakshmi. The goddess gave them
a casket containing one of her [<a id="pb95"
href="#pb95" name="pb95">95]ear ornaments (kamma), and
enjoined them to worship it for a hundred years. At the expiry of that
period, a band of five hundred armed warriors sprang up from the
casket, who, at the request of the Rishis, attacked and destroyed the
giants. After this they were directed to engage in agriculture, being
promised extensive estates, and the consideration paid to Kshatriyas.
They accordingly became possessed of large territories, such as
Amr&#257;vati and others in the Kistna, Nellore and other districts,
and have always been most successful agriculturists.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1506src" href="#xd21e1506" name=
"xd21e1506src">62
Some Kammas, when questioned by Mr. F. R. Hemingway in the
God&#257;vari district, stated that they were originally Kshatriyas,
but were long ago persecuted by a king of the family of Parikshat,
because one of them called him a bastard. They sought refuge with the
K&#257;pus, who took them in, and they adopted the customs of their
protectors. According to another legend, a valuable ear ornament,
belonging to R&#257;ja Prat&#257;pa Rudra, fell into the hands of an
enemy, whom a section of the K&#257;pus boldly attacked, and recovered
the jewel. This feat earned for them and their descendants the title
Kamma. Some of the K&#257;pus ran away, and they are reputed to be the
ancestors of the Velamas (veli, away). At the time when the Kammas and
Velamas formed a single caste, they observed the Muhammadan g&#333;sha
system, whereby the women are kept in seclusion. This was, however,
found to be very inconvenient for their agricultural pursuits. They
accordingly determined to abandon it, and an agreement was drawn up on
a palm-leaf scroll. Those who signed it are said to have become Kammas,
and those who declined to do so [<a id="pb96"
href="#pb96" name="pb96">96]Velamas, or outsiders. One
meaning of the word kamma is the palm-leaf roll, such as is used to
produce dilatation of the lobes of the ears. According to another
story, there once lived a king, Belthi Reddi by name, who had a large
number of wives, the favourite among whom he appointed R&#257;ni. The
other wives, being jealous, induced their sons to steal all the jewels
of the R&#257;ni, but they were caught in the act by the king, who on
the following day asked his wife for her jewels, which she could not
produce. Some of the sons ran away, and gave origin to the Velamas;
others restored the kamma, and became Kammas. Yet one more story.
Prat&#257;pa Rudra&rsquo;s wife lost her ear ornament, and four of the
king&rsquo;s captains were sent in search of it. Of these, one restored
the jewel, and his descendants became Kammas; the second attacked the
thieves, and gave origin to the Velamas; the third ran away, and so his
children became the ancestors of the Pakan&#257;tis; and the fourth
disappeared.
According to the Census Report, 1891, the main sub-divisions of the
Kammas are Gampa, Illuvellani, G&#333;daj&#257;ti, K&#257;vali, Vaduga,
Pedda, and Bang&#257;ru. It would seem that there are two main
endogamous sections, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1515" title=
"Source: G&#257;mpa">Gampa (basket) Ch&#257;tu, and G&#333;da
(wall) Ch&#257;tu. Ch&#257;tu is said to mean a screen or hiding place.
Concerning the origin of these sections, the following story is told.
Two sisters were bathing in a tank (pond), when a king happened to pass
by. To hide themselves, one of the girls hid behind a basket, and the
other behind a wall. The descendants of the two sisters became the
Gampa and G&#333;da Ch&#257;tu Kammas, who may not intermarry by reason
of their original close relationship. According to another legend,
after a desperate battle, some members of the caste escaped by hiding
behind baskets, others behind a wall. The terms Illuvellani and Pedda
seem to [<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97]be synonymous with G&#333;dachatu. The women of
this section were g&#333;sha, and not allowed to appear in public, and
even at the present day they do not go out and work freely in the
fields. The name Illuvellani indicates those who do not go (vellani)
out of the house (illu). The name Pedda (great) refers to the
superiority of the section. Vaduga simply means Telugu, and is probably
a name given by Tamilians to the Kammas who live amongst them. The name
Bang&#257;ru is said to refer to the custom of the women of this
sub-division wearing only gold nose ornaments (bang&#257;ramu). The
G&#333;daj&#257;ti sub-division is said to be most numerously
represented in North Arcot and Chingleput, the Illuvellani in Kistna,
Nellore and Anantapur. The K&#257;vali sub-division is practically
confined to the God&#257;vari, and the Pedda to the Kistna district.
The Vaduga Kammas are found chiefly in Coimbatore.
In his note on the Kammas of the God&#257;vari district, Mr.
Hemingway writes that &ldquo;in this district they are divided into
K&#257;vitis, Er&#275;dis, Gampas or G&#363;das, Uggams, and
R&#257;chas. These names are, according to local accounts, derived from
curious household customs, generally from traditional methods of
carrying water. Thus, the K&#257;vitis will not ordinarily carry water
except in pots on a k&#257;vidi, the Er&#275;dis except on a
pack-bullock, the Uggams except in pots held in the hand, and not on
the hip or head, the R&#257;chas except in a pot carried by two
persons. The Gampa women, when they first go to their husbands&rsquo;
houses, take the customary presents in a basket. It is said that these
practices are generally observed at the present day.&rdquo;
Writing concerning the Iluvedalani (Illuvellani) Kammas, the editor
of the Kurnool Manual (1886) states that &ldquo;a few families only
exist in the district. The [<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98]women are kept in strict g&#333;sha.
They consider it beneath them to spin thread, or to do other work. A
sub-division of this caste lives in Pullalcheruvu, whose families, also
g&#333;sha, work at the spindles, like other women of the country.
Another class of indoor Kammas resides about Owk. They are apparently
descendants of the Kammas, who followed the Naiks from Gunt&#363;r to
Gandikota in the sixteenth century. They are now reduced, and the
females work, like K&#257;pus, in the field. The Gampas are
distinguished from the indoor Kammas by their women wearing the cloth
over the right, instead of the left shoulder.&rdquo;
As with other Telugu castes, there are, among the Kammas, a number
of exogamous septs or intip&#275;ru, of which the following are
examples:&mdash;




Anumollu, Dolichos Lablab.
Tsanda, tax or subscription.
Jasthi, too much.
Mallela, jasmine.
Lanka, island.
Thota k&#363;ra, Amarantus ganget&iacute;cus.
Komma, horn, or branch of a tree.
Ch&#275;ni, dry field.




Palakala, planks.
Kast&#363;ri, musk.
Bathth&#257;la, rice.
Karnam, accountant.
Irpina, combs.
G&#257;li, wind.
Dhani&#257;la, coriander.




The Kammas also have g&#333;tras such as Chittipoola, Kurunollu,
Kulakala, Upp&#257;la, Cheruku (sugar-cane), Vallotla, and
Yenamalla.
When matters affecting the community have to be decided, a council
of the leading members thereof assembles. But, in some places, there is
a permanent headman, called Mannemantri or Chaudri.
The Kammas will work as coolies in the fields, but will, on no
account, engage themselves as domestic servants. &ldquo;They
are,&rdquo; the Rev. J. Cain writes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1574src" href="#xd21e1574" name="xd21e1574src">63 &ldquo;as a
rule a fine well-built class of cultivators, very proud and
[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99]exclusive, and have a great aversion to town life.
Many of them never allow their wives to leave their compounds, and it
is said that many never do field work on Sundays, but confine
themselves on that day to their house-work.&rdquo; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; a
correspondent writes from the Kistna district, &ldquo;you ask in a
village whether so-and-so is a Br&#257;hman, and they say &lsquo;No. He
is an &#257;s&#257;mi (ordinary man),&rsquo; he will be a Kamma or
K&#257;pu. If you ask how many pay income-tax in a village, they may
tell you two Baniyas (merchants), and two Sams&#257;ri-vallu,
i.e., two prosperous Kamma ryots.&rdquo;
The Kammas are stated by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1584src" href="#xd21e1584" name="xd21e1584src">64 to be
&ldquo;most industrious and intelligent cultivators, who, now that
g&#333;sha has been generally abandoned, beat all rivals out of the
field&mdash;a fact which is recognised by several proverbs, such as
Kamma v&#257;ni ch&#275;tulu katt&#299;na nilavadu (though you tie a
Kamma&rsquo;s hands, he will not be quiet); Kamma v&#257;ndlu
ch&#275;r&#299;te kadama j&#257;tula vellunu (if Kammas come in, other
castes go out); Kamma v&#257;riki bh&#363;mi bhayapadu tunnadi (the
earth fears the Kammas), and many others to the same effect. In
addition to being industrious and well-to-do they are very proud, an
instance of which occurred in the Kistna district, when the Revenue
Settlement Officer offered them patt&#257;s, in which they were simply
called Naidu without the honorific ending g&#257;ru. They refused on
this account to accept them, and finally the desired alteration was
made, as they proved that all of their caste were considered entitled
to the distinction. In North Arcot, however, they are not so
particular, though some refuse to have their head shaved, because they
scruple to bow down before a barber. Besides Vishnu the Kammas worship
[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100]Ganga, because they say that long ago they fled
from Northern India, to avoid the anger of a certain R&#257;ja, who had
been refused a bride from among them. They were pursued, but their
women, on reaching the Mah&#257;nadi, prayed for a passage to Ganga,
who opened a dry path for them through the river. Crossing, they all
hid themselves in a dholl (Cajanus indicus) field, and thus
escaped from their pursuers. For this reason, at their marriages, they
tie a bunch of dholl leaves to the north-eastern post of the wedding
booth, and worship Ganga before tying the t&#257;li.&rdquo;
Among the Kammas of the Tamil country, the bridegroom is said to be
sometimes much younger than the bride, and a case is on record of a
wife of twenty-two years of age, who used to carry her boy-husband on
her hip, as a mother carries her child.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1594src" href="#xd21e1594" name="xd21e1594src">65 A parallel
is to be found in Russia, where not very long ago grown-up women were
to be seen carrying about boys of six, to whom they were
betrothed.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1597src" href="#xd21e1597" name=
"xd21e1597src">66 Widow remarriage is not permitted. Widows of the
G&#333;da chatu section wear white, and those of the Gampa chatu
section coloured cloths.
Prior to the betrothal ceremony, female ancestors, Vign&#275;swara,
and the Gr&#257;ma D&#275;vata (village deities) are worshipped. A near
relation of the future bridegroom proceeds, with a party, to the home
of the future bride. On their way thither, they look for omens, such as
the crossing of birds in an auspicious direction. Immediately on the
occurrence of a favourable omen, they burn camphor, and break a
cocoanut, which must split in two with clean edges. One half is sent to
the would-be bridegroom, and the other taken to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101]bride&rsquo;s house. If the first cocoanut does
not split properly, others are broken till the wished-for result is
obtained. When the girl&rsquo;s house is reached, she demands the
sagunam (omen) cocoanut. Her lap is filled with flowers, cocoanuts,
turmeric, plantains, betel leaves and areca nuts, combs, sandal paste,
and coloured powder (kunkumam). The wedding day is then fixed. Marriage
is generally celebrated at the house of the bridegroom, but, if it is a
case of kannikadh&#257;nam (presenting the girl without claiming the
bride&rsquo;s price), at the house of the bride. The bride-price is
highest in the Gampa section. On the first day of the marriage rites,
the petta mugada sangyam, or box-lid ceremony is performed. The new
cloths for the bridal couple, five plantains, nuts, and pieces of
turmeric, one or two combs, four rupees, and the bride-price in money
or jewels, are placed in a box, which is placed near the parents of the
contracting couple. The contents of the box are then laid out on the
lid, and examined by the sammandhis (new relations by marriage). The
bride&rsquo;s father gives betel leaves and areca nuts to the father of
the bridegroom, saying &ldquo;The girl is yours, and the money
mine.&rdquo; The bridegroom&rsquo;s father hands them back, saying
&ldquo;The girl is mine, and the money yours.&rdquo; This is repeated
three times. The officiating pur&#333;hit (priest) then announces that
the man&rsquo;s daughter is to be given in marriage to so-and-so, and
the promise is made before the assembled D&#275;va Br&#257;hmanas, and
in the presence of light, Agni, and the D&#275;vatas. This ceremony is
binding, and, should the bridegroom perchance die before the bottu
(marriage badge) is tied, she becomes, and remains a widow. The
milk-post is next set up, the marriage pots are arranged, and the
nalagu ceremony is performed. This consists of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102]<span class="corr" id="xd21e1605" title=
"Source: annointing">anointing of the bridal couple with oil,
and smearing the shoulders with turmeric flour, or Acacia
Concinna paste. A barber pares the nails of the bridegroom, and
simply touches those of the bride with a mango leaf dipped in milk. In
some places this rite is omitted by the Gampa section. A small wooden
framework, called dhornam, with cotton threads wound round it, is
generally tied to the marriage pandal (booth) by a Ts&#257;kali
(washerman) not only at a marriage among the Kammas, but also among the
Balijas, K&#257;pus, and Velamas. After the return of the bridal couple
from bathing, the bridegroom is decorated, and taken to a specially
prepared place within or outside the house, to perform
V&#299;ra-gudimokkadam, or worship of heroes in their temple. At the
spot selected a pandal has been erected, and beneath it three or five
bricks, representing the heroes (v&#299;ralu), are set up. The bricks
are smeared with turmeric paste, and painted with red dots. In front of
the bricks an equal number of pots are placed, and they are worshipped
by breaking a cocoanut, and burning camphor and incense. The bridegroom
then prostrates himself before the bricks, and, taking up a sword, cuts
some lime fruits, and touches the pots three times. In former days, a
goat or sheep was sacrificed. The hero worship, as performed by the
G&#333;da section, differs from the above rite as practiced by the
Gampa section. Instead of erecting a pandal, the G&#333;das go to a
p&#299;pal (Ficus religiosa) tree, near which one or more
daggers are placed. A yellow cotton thread is wound three or five times
round the tree, which is worshipped. As a substitute for animal
sacrifice, lime fruits are cut. The hero worship concluded, the
wrist-threads of cotton and wool (kankanam) are tied on the bride and
bridegroom, who is taken to the temple after he has bathed and dressed
himself in new clothes. On [<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103]his return to the booth, the
pur&#333;hit lights the sacred fire, and the contracting couple sit
side by side on a plank. They then stand, with a screen spread between
them, and the bridegroom, with his right big toe on that of the bride,
ties the bottu round her neck. They then go three times round the dais,
with the ends of their cloths knotted together. The bottu of the Gampas
is a concave disc of gold, that of the G&#333;das a larger flat disc.
On the following day, the usual n&#257;gavali, or sacrifice to the
D&#275;vas is offered, and a n&#257;gavali bottu (small gold disc)
tied. All the relations make presents to the bridal pair, who indulge
in a mock representation of domestic life. On the third day, pongal
(rice) is offered to the pots, and the wrist-threads are removed. Like
the Palli bridegroom, the Kamma bridegroom performs a mimic ploughing
ceremony, but at the house instead of at a tank (pond). He goes to a
basket filled with earth, carrying the iron bar of a ploughshare, an
ox-goad, and rope, accompanied by the bride carrying in her lap seeds
or seedlings. While he pretends to be ploughing, his sister stops him,
and will not let him continue till he has promised to give his
first-born daughter to her son in marriage. The marriage pots are
presented to the sisters of the bridegroom. During the marriage
celebration, meat must not be cooked.
Among the Kammas, consummation does not take place till three months
after the marriage ceremony, as it is considered unlucky to have three
heads of a family in a household during the first year of marriage. By
the delay, the birth of a child should take place only in the second
year, so that, during the first year, there will be only two heads,
husband and wife. In like manner, it is noted by Mr. Francis<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1618src" href="#xd21e1618" name=
"xd21e1618src">67 that, among the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1621"
title="Source: Gangimakkulu">Gangimakkalu <span class=
"pagenum">[104]and
M&#257;digas, the marriage is not consummated till three months after
its celebration.
When a pregnant woman is delivered, twigs of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Balanites Roxburghii are placed round the house.
The dead are usually cremated. As the moment of death approaches, a
cocoanut is broken, and camphor burnt. The thumbs and great toes of the
corpse are tied together. A woman, who is left a widow, exchanges betel
with her dead husband, and the women put rice into his mouth. The
corpse is carried to the burning-ground on a bier, with the head
towards the house. When it approaches a spot called Arichandra&rsquo;s
temple, the bier is placed on the ground, and food is placed at the
four corners. Then a Paraiyan or M&#257;la repeats the formula &ldquo;I
am the first born (i.e., the representative of the oldest
caste). I wore the sacred thread at the outset. I am Sangu Paraiyan (or
Reddi M&#257;la). I was the patron of Arichandra. Lift the corpse, and
turn it round with its head towards the sm&#257;sanam (burning-ground),
and feet towards the house.&rdquo; When the corpse has been laid on the
pyre, the relations throw rice over it, and the chief mourner goes
three times round the pyre, carrying on his shoulder a pot of water, in
which a barber makes holes. During the third turn he lights the pyre,
and throwing down the pot, goes off to bathe. On the following day, a
stone is placed on the spot where the deceased breathed his last, and
his clothes are put close to it. The women pour milk over the stone,
and offer milk, cocoanuts, cooked rice, betel, etc., to it. These are
taken by the males to the burning-ground. When Arichandra&rsquo;s
temple is reached, they place there a small quantity of food on a leaf.
At the burning-ground, the fire is extinguished, and the charred bones
are collected, and placed on a plantain leaf. Out of the ashes they
make an effigy on [<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105]the ground, to which food is offered on
four leaves, one of which is placed on the abdomen of the figure, and
the other three are set by the side of it. The first of these is taken
by the Paraiyan, and the others are given to a barber, washerman, and
Panisavan (a mendicant caste). The final death ceremonies
(karm&#257;ndhiram) are performed on the sixteenth day. They commence
with the puny&#257;ham, or purificatory ceremony, and the giving of
presents to Br&#257;hmans. Inside the house, the dead person&rsquo;s
clothes are worshipped by the women. The widow is taken to a tank or
well, where her n&#257;gavali bottu is removed. This usually wears out
in a very short time, so a new one is worn for the purpose of the death
ceremony. The males proceed to a tank, and make an effigy on the
ground, near which three small stones are set up. On these libations of
water are poured, and cooked rice, vegetables, etc., are offered. The
chief mourner then goes into the water, carrying the effigy, which is
thrown in, and dives as many times as there have been days between the
funeral and the karm&#257;ndhiram. The ceremony closes with the making
of presents to the Br&#257;hmans and agnates. Towards evening, the
widow sits on a small quantity of rice on the ground, and her marriage
bottu is removed. The Kammas perform a first annual ceremony, but not a
regular sr&#257;dh afterwards.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1638src"
href="#xd21e1638" name="xd21e1638src">68
As regards their religion, some Kammas are Saivites, others
Vaishnavites. Most of the Saivites are disciples of &#256;r&#257;dhya
Br&#257;hmans, and the Vaishnavites of Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans or
S&#257;t&#257;nis. The Gampas reverence Draupadi, Mannars&#257;mi,
Gangamma, Ankamma, and Padavetiamma; the G&#333;das Poleramma,
Veikandla Thalli (the thousand-eyed goddess) and Padavetiamma.

Kamma (ear ornament).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Mot&#257;ti
K&#257;pu.
Kamm&#257;lan (Tamil).&mdash;The original form of the name
Kamm&#257;lan appears to have been Kann&#257;lan or Kann&#257;lar, both
of which occur in Tamil poems, e.g., Thondamandala Satakam and
Er Ezhuvathu, attributed to the celebrated poet Kamban. Kann&#257;lan
denotes one who rules the eye, or one who gives the eye. When an image
is made, its consecration takes place at the temple. Towards the close
of the ceremonial, the Kamm&#257;lan who made it comes forward, and
carves out the eyes of the image. The name is said also to refer to
those who make articles, and open the eyes of the people, i.e.,
who make articles pleasing to the eyes.
A very interesting account of the n&#275;tra mangalya, or ceremony
of painting the eyes of images, as performed by craftsmen in Ceylon,
has been published by Mr. A. K. Coomaraswamy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1661src" href="#xd21e1661" name="xd21e1661src">69 Therein he
writes that &ldquo;by far the most important ceremony connected with
the building and decoration of a vih&#257;ra (temple), or with its
renovation, was the actual n&#275;tra mangalya or eye
ceremonial. The ceremony had to be performed in the case of any image,
whether set up in a vih&#257;ra or not. Even in the case of flat
paintings it was necessary. D. S. Muhandiram, when making for me a book
of drawings of gods according to the Rup&#257;valiya, left the eyes to
be subsequently inserted on a suitable auspicious occasion, with some
simpler form of the ceremony described.
&ldquo;Knox has a reference to the subject as follows. &lsquo;Some,
being devoutly disposed, will make the image of this god (Buddha) at
their own charge. For the making whereof they must bountifully reward
the [<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107]Founder. Before the eyes are made, it is not
accounted a god, but a lump of ordinary metal, and thrown about the
shop with no more regard than anything else. But, when the eyes are to
be made, the artificer is to have a good gratification, besides the
first agreed upon reward. The eyes being formed, it is thenceforward a
god. And then, being brought with honour from the workman&rsquo;s shop,
it is dedicated by solemnities and sacrifices, and carried with great
state into its shrine or little house, which is before built and
prepared for it.&rsquo;&rdquo; The pupils of the eyes of a series of
clay votive offerings, which were specially made for me, were not
painted at the potter&rsquo;s house, but in the verandah of the
traveller&rsquo;s bungalow where I was staying.
The Tamil Kamm&#257;lans are divided into three endogamous
territorial groups, P&#257;ndya, S&#333;zia (or Ch&#333;la), and
Kongan. The P&#257;ndyas live principally in the Madura and Tinnevelly
districts, and the S&#333;zias in the Trichinopoly, Tanjore,
Chingleput, North and South Arcot districts, and Madras. The Kongas are
found chiefly in the Salem and Coimbatore districts. In some places,
there are still further sub-divisions of territorial origin. Thus, the
P&#257;ndya Tatt&#257;ns are divided into Karakattar, Vambanattar,
Pennaikku-akkarayar (those on the other side of the Pennaiyar river),
Munn&#363;ru-v&#299;ttuk&#257;rar (those of the three hundred
families), and so forth. They are further divided into exogamous septs,
the names of which are derived from places, e.g., Perugumani,
Musiri, Oryan&#257;du, Thiruchendurai, and Kalagun&#257;du.
The Kamm&#257;lans are made up of five occupational sections, viz.,
Tatt&#257;n (goldsmith), Kann&#257;n (brass-smith), Tac&rsquo;chan
(carpenter), Kal-Tac&rsquo;chan (stone-mason), and Kollan or
Karum&#257;n (blacksmith). The name P&#257;nch&#257;la, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108]which is sometimes used by the Tamil as well as
the Canarese artisan classes, has reference to the fivefold
occupations. The various sections intermarry, but the goldsmiths have,
especially in towns, ceased to intermarry with the blacksmiths. The
Kamm&#257;lans, claiming, as will be seen later on, to be
Br&#257;hmans, have adopted Br&#257;hmanical g&#333;tras, and the five
sections have five g&#333;tras called Visvagu, Janagha, Ahima,
Janardana, and Ubh&#275;ndra, after certain Rishis (sages). Each of
these g&#333;tras, it is said, has twenty-five subordinate g&#333;tras
attached to it. The names of these, however, are not forthcoming, and
indeed, except some individuals who act as priests for the
Kamm&#257;lans, few seem to have any knowledge of them. In their
marriages the Kamm&#257;lans closely imitate the Br&#257;hmanical
ceremonial, and the ceremonies last for three or five days according to
the means of the parties. The parisam, or bride&rsquo;s money, is paid,
as among other non-Br&#257;hmanical castes. Widows are allowed the use
of ordinary jewelry and betel, which is not the case among
Br&#257;hmans, and they are not compelled to make the usual fasts, or
observe the feasts commonly observed by Br&#257;hmans.
The Kamm&#257;lan caste is highly organised, and its organisation is
one of its most interesting features. Each of the five divisions has at
its head a N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran or headman, and a
K&#257;ryasthan, or chief executive officer, under him, who are elected
by members of the particular division. Over them is the Anjiv&#299;ttu
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran (also known as Ainduvittu
Periyathanakk&#257;ran or Anjij&#257;ti N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran),
who is elected by lot by representatives chosen from among the five
sub-divisions. Each of these chooses ten persons to represent it at the
election. These ten again select one of their number, who is the local
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran, or one who is likely to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109]become so. The five men thus selected meet on an
appointed day, with the castemen, at the temple of the caste goddess
K&#257;m&#257;kshi Amman. The names of the five men are written on five
slips of paper, which, together with some blank slips, are thrown
before the shrine of the goddess. A child, taken at random from the
assembled crowd, is made to pick up the slips, and he whose name first
turns up is proclaimed as Anjiv&#299;ttu N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran,
and a big turban is tied on his head by the caste priest. This is
called Urum&#257; Kattaradu, and is symbolic of his having been
appointed the general head of the caste. Lots are then drawn, to decide
which of the remaining four shall be the Anjiv&#299;ttu K&#257;ryasthan
of the newly-elected chief. At the conclusion of the ceremony, betel
leaf and areca nut are given first to the new officers, then to the
local officers, and finally to the assembled spectators. With this, the
installation ceremony, which is called pattam-kattaradu, comes to an
end. The money for the expenses thereof is, if necessary, taken from
the funds of the temple, but a special collection is generally made for
the occasion, and is, it is said, responded to with alacrity. The
Anjiv&#299;ttu N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran is theoretically invested
with full powers over the caste, and all members thereof are expected
to obey his orders. He is the final adjudicator of civil and
matrimonial causes. The divisional heads have power to decide such
causes, and they report their decisions to the Anjiv&#299;ttu
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran, who generally confirms them. If, for any
reason, the parties concerned do not agree to abide by the decision,
they are advised to take their cause to one of the established courts.
The Anjiv&#299;ttu N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran has at times to
nominate, and always the right to confirm or not, the selection of the
divisional heads. In conjunction with the K&#257;ryasthan <span class=
"pagenum">[110]and
the local heads, he may appoint N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;rans and
K&#257;ryasthans to particular places, and delegate his powers to them.
This is done in places where the caste is represented in considerable
numbers, as at Sholavandan and Vattalag&#363;ndu in the Madura
district. In this connection, a quaint custom may be noted. The
Pallans, who are known as &ldquo;the sons of the caste&rdquo; in
villages of the Madura and Tinnevelly districts, are called together,
and informed that a particular village is about to be converted into a
local Anjiv&#299;ttu N&#257;tt&#257;nmai, and that they must possess a
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran and K&#257;ryasthan for themselves. These
are nominated in practice by the Pallans, and the nomination is
confirmed by the Anjiv&#299;ttu N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran. From
that day, they have a right to get new ploughs from the Kallans free of
charge, and give them in return a portion of the produce of the land.
The local N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;rans are practically under the
control of the K&#257;ryasthan of the Anjiv&#299;ttu
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran, and, as the phrase goes, they are
&ldquo;bound down to&rdquo; the words of this official, who possesses
great power and influence with the community. The local officials may
be removed from office by the Anjiv&#299;ttu
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran or his K&#257;ryasthan, but this is
rarely done, and only when, for any valid reason, the sub-divisions
insist on it. The mode of resigning office is for the
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran or K&#257;ryasthan to bring betel leaf
and areca nut, lay them before the Anjiv&#299;ttu
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran, or his K&#257;ryasthan, and prostrate
himself in front of him. There is a tendency for the various offices to
become hereditary, provided those succeeding to them are rich and
respected by the community. The Anjiv&#299;ttu
N&#257;tt&#257;maikk&#257;ran is entitled to the first betel at caste
weddings, even outside his own jurisdiction. His powers are in striking
contrast with those of the caste Guru, who resides in Tinnevelly,
[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111]and occasionally travels northwards. He
purifies, it is said, those who are charged with drinking intoxicating
liquor, eating flesh, or crossing the sea, if such persons subject
themselves to his jurisdiction. If they do not, he does not even
exercise the power of excommunication, which he nominally possesses. He
is not a Sany&#257;si, but a Grihastha or householder. He marries his
daughters to castemen, though he refrains from eating in their
houses.

Kamm&#257;lans.

The dead are, as a rule, buried in a sitting posture, but, at the
present day, cremation is sometimes resorted to. Death pollution, as
among some other non-Br&#257;hmanical castes, lasts for sixteen days.
It is usual for a Pand&#257;ram to officiate at the death ceremonies.
On the first day, the corpse is anointed with oil, and given a soap-nut
bath. On the third day, five lingams are made with mud, of which four
are placed in the four corners at the spot where the corpse was buried,
and the fifth is placed in the centre. Food is distributed on the fifth
day to Pand&#257;rams and the castemen. Sr&#257;dh (annual death
ceremony) is not as a rule performed, except in some of the larger
towns.
The Kamm&#257;lans profess the Saiva form of the Br&#257;hman
religion, and reverence greatly Pillaiyar, the favourite son of Siva. A
few have come under the Ling&#257;yat influence. The caste, however,
has its own special goddess K&#257;m&#257;kshi Amma, who is commonly
spoken of as Vriththi Daivam. She is worshipped by all the
sub-divisions, and female children are frequently named after her. She
is represented by the firepot and bellows-fire at which the castemen
work, and presides over them. On all auspicious occasions, the first
betel and dakshina (present of money) are set apart in her name, and
sent to the p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) of the local temple dedicated
[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112]to her. Oaths are taken in her name, and
disputes affecting the caste are settled before her temple. There also
elections to caste offices are held. The exact connection of the
goddess K&#257;m&#257;kshi with the caste is not known. There is,
however, a vague tradition that she was one of the virgins who
committed suicide by throwing herself into a fire, and was in
consequence deified. Various village goddesses (gr&#257;ma d&#275;vata)
are also worshipped, and, though the Kamm&#257;lans profess to be
vegetarians, animal sacrifices are offered to them. Among these deities
are the Saptha Kannimar or seven virgins, K&#333;chad&#275;
Periy&#257;ndavan, and Periya Nayanar. Those who worship the Saptha
Kannimar are known by the name of M&#257;d&#257;vaguppu, or the
division that worships the mothers. Those who revere the other two
deities mentioned are called N&#257;d&#299;k&#257; Vamsath&#257;l, or
those descended from men who, through the seven virgins, attained
eternal bliss. K&#333;chad&#275; Periy&#257;ndavan is said to be a
corruption of Or Jat&#275; Periya P&#257;ndyan, meaning the great
P&#257;ndya with the single lock. He is regarded as Vishnu, and Periya
Nayanar is held to be a manifestation of Siva. The former is said to
have been the person who invited the Tatt&#257;ns (who called
themselves P&#257;ndya Tatt&#257;ns) to settle in his kingdom. It is
traditionally stated that they emigrated from the north, and settled in
the Madura and Tinnevelly districts. An annual festival in honour of
K&#333;chad&#275; Periy&#257;ndavan is held in these districts, for the
expenses in connection with which a subscription is raised among the
five sub-divisions. The festival lasts over three days. On the first
day, the image of the deified king is anointed with water, and a
mixture of the juices of the mango, j&#257;k (Artocarpus
integrifolia), and plantain, called muppala p&#363;jai. On the
second day, rice is boiled, and offered to the god, and, on the last
day, [<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113]a healthy ram is sacrificed to him. This
festival is said to be held, in order to secure the caste as a whole
against evils that might overtake it. Tac&rsquo;chans (carpenters)
usually kill, or cut the ear of a ram or sheep, whenever they commence
the woodwork of a new house, and smear the blood of the animal on a
pillar or wall of the house.
The Kamm&#257;lans claim to be descended from Visvakarma, the
architect of the gods, and, in some places, claim to be superior to
Br&#257;hmans, calling the latter G&#333;-Br&#257;hmans, and themselves
Visva Br&#257;hmans. Visvakarma is said to have had five sons, named
Manu, Maya, Silpa, Tvashtra, and Daivagna. These five sons were the
originators of the five crafts, which their descendants severally
follow. Accordingly, some engage in smithy work, and are called Manus;
others, in their turn, devote their attention to carpentry. These are
named Mayas. Others again, who work at stone-carving, are known as
Silpis. Those who do metal work are Tvashtras, and those who are
engaged in making jewelry are known as Visvagnas or Daivagnas.
According to one story of the origin of the Kamm&#257;lans, they are
the descendants of the issue of a Br&#257;hman and a B&#275;ri Chetti
woman. Hence the proverb that the Kamm&#257;lans and the B&#275;ri
Chettis are one. Another story, recorded in the Mackenzie manuscripts,
which is current all over the Tamil country, is briefly as follows. In
the town of M&#257;nd&#257;puri, the Kamm&#257;lans of the five
divisions formerly lived closely united together. They were employed by
all sorts of people, as there were no other artificers in the country,
and charged very high rates for their wares. They feared and respected
no king. This offended the kings of the country, who combined against
them. As the fort in which the Kamm&#257;lans concealed themselves,
called K&#257;ntakk&#333;ttai, was entirely constructed of loadstone,
all [<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114]the weapons were drawn away by it. The king then
promised a big reward to anyone who would burn down the fort, and at
length the D&#275;va-d&#257;s&#299;s (courtesans) of a temple undertook
to do this, and took betel and nut in signification of their promise.
The king built a fort for them opposite K&#257;ntakk&#333;ttai, and
they attracted the Kamm&#257;lans by their singing, and had children by
them. One of the D&#275;va-d&#257;s&#299;s at length succeeded in
extracting from a young Kamm&#257;lan the secret that, if the fort was
surrounded with varaghu straw and set on fire, it would be destroyed.
The king ordered that this should be done, and, in attempting to escape
from the sudden conflagration, some of the Kamm&#257;lans lost their
lives. Others reached the ships, and escaped by sea, or were captured
and put to death. In consequence of this, artificers ceased to exist in
the country. One pregnant Kamm&#257;lan woman, however, took refuge in
the house of a B&#275;ri Chetti, and escaped decapitation by being
passed off as his daughter. The country was sorely troubled owing to
the want of artificers, and agriculture, manufactures, and weaving
suffered a great deal. One of the kings wanted to know if any
Kamm&#257;lan escaped the general destruction, and sent round his
kingdom a piece of coral possessing a tortuous aperture running through
it, and a piece of thread. A big reward was promised to anyone who
should succeed in passing the thread through the coral. At last, the
boy born of the Kamm&#257;lan woman in the Chetti&rsquo;s house
undertook to do it. He placed the coral over the mouth of an ant-hole,
and, having steeped the thread in sugar, laid it down at some distance
from the hole. The ants took the thread, and drew it through the coral.
The king, being pleased with the boy, sent him presents, and gave him
more work to do. This he performed with the assistance of his mother,
and satisfied [<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115]the king. The king, however, grew suspicious,
and, having sent for the Chetti, enquired concerning the boy&rsquo;s
parentage. The Chetti thereon detailed the story of his birth. The king
provided him with the means for making ploughshares on a large scale,
and got him married to the daughter of a Chetti, and made gifts of land
for the maintenance of the couple. The Chetti woman bore him five sons,
who followed the five branches of work now carried out by the
Kamm&#257;lan caste. The king gave them the title of Panchayudhattar,
or those of the five kinds of weapons. They now intermarry with each
other, and, as children of the Chetti caste, wear the sacred thread.
The members of the caste who fled by sea are said to have gone to
China, or, according to another version, to Chingaladv&#299;pam, or
Ceylon, where Kamm&#257;lans are found at the present day. In
connection with the above story, it may be noted that, though
ordinarily two different castes do not live in the same house, yet
B&#275;ri Chettis and Kamm&#257;lans so live together. There is a close
connection between the Kamm&#257;lans and Acharap&#257;kam Chettis, who
are a section of the B&#275;ri Chetti caste. Kamm&#257;lans and
Acharap&#257;kam Chettis interdine; both bury their dead in a sitting
posture; and the t&#257;li (marriage badge) used by both is alike in
size and make, and unlike that used by the generality of the B&#275;ri
Chetti caste. The Acharap&#257;kam Chettis are known as Malighe
Chettis, and are considered to be the descendants of those B&#275;ri
Chettis who brought up the Kamm&#257;lan children, and intermarried
with them. Even now, in the city of Madras, when the B&#275;ri Chettis
assemble for the transaction of caste business, the notice summoning
the meeting excludes the Malighe Chettis, who can neither vote nor
receive votes at elections, meetings, etc., of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116]Kandas&#257;mi temple, which every other
B&#275;ri Chetti has a right to.
It may be noted that the D&#275;va-d&#257;s&#299;s, whose treachery
is said to have led to the destruction of the Kamm&#257;lan caste, were
Kaik&#333;lans by caste, and that their illegitimate children, like
their progenitors, became weavers. The weavers of South India,
according to old Tamil poems, were formerly included in the Kammiyan or
Kamm&#257;lan caste.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1714src" href=
"#xd21e1714" name="xd21e1714src">70 Several inscriptions show that,
as late as 1013 A.D., the Kamm&#257;lans were treated as an inferior
caste, and, in consequence, were confined to particular parts of
villages.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1717src" href="#xd21e1717" name=
"xd21e1717src">71 A later inscription gives an order of one of the
Ch&#333;la kings that they should be permitted to blow conches, and
beat drums at their weddings and funerals, wear sandals, and plaster
their houses.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1720src" href="#xd21e1720"
name="xd21e1720src">72 &ldquo;It is not difficult,&rdquo; Mr. H. A.
Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1725src" href="#xd21e1725"
name="xd21e1725src">73 &ldquo;to account for the low position held
by the Kamm&#257;lans, for it must be remembered that, in those early
times, the military castes in India, as elsewhere, looked down upon all
engaged in labour, whether skilled or otherwise. With the decline of
the military power, however, it was natural that a useful caste like
the Kamm&#257;lans should generally improve its position, and the
reaction from their long oppression has led them to make the
exaggerated claims described above, which are ridiculed by every other
caste, high or low.&rdquo; The claims here referred to are that they
are descended from Visvakarma, the architect of the gods, and are
Br&#257;hmans.
From a note by Mr. F. R. Hemingway, I gather that the friendship
between the Muhammadans and Kamm&#257;lans, who call each other
m&#257;ni (paternal uncle) [<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117]&ldquo;originated in the fact that
a holy Muhammadan, named Ibrahim Nabi, was brought up in the house of a
Kamm&#257;lan, because his father was afraid that he would be killed by
a Hindu king named Namad&#363;ta, who had been advised by his
soothsayers that he would thus avoid a disaster, which was about to
befall his kingdom. The Kamm&#257;lan gave his daughter to the father
of Ibrahim in exchange. Another story (only told by Kamm&#257;lans) is
to the effect that the Kamm&#257;lans were once living in a magnetic
castle, called K&#257;nda K&#333;ttai, which could only be destroyed by
burning it with varagu straw; and that the Musalmans captured it by
sending Musalman prostitutes into the town, to wheedle the secret out
of the Kamm&#257;lans. The friendship, according to the story, sprang
up because the Kamm&#257;lans consorted with the Musalman
women.&rdquo;
The Kamm&#257;lans belong to the left hand, as opposed to the right
hand faction. The origin of this distinction of castes is lost in
obscurity, but, according to one version, it arose out of a dispute
between the Kamm&#257;lans and Vell&#257;las. The latter claimed the
former as their J&#257;tipillaigal or caste dependents, while the
former claimed the latter as their own dependents. The fight grew so
fierce that the Ch&#333;la king of Conjeeveram ranged these two castes
and their followers on opposite sides, and enquired into their claims.
The Kamm&#257;lans, and those who sided with them, stood on the left of
the king, and the Vell&#257;las and their allies on the right. The king
is said to have decided the case against the Kamm&#257;lans, who then
dispersed in different directions. According to another legend, a
Kamm&#257;lan who had two sons, one by a Balija woman, and the other by
his Kamm&#257;lan wife, was unjustly slain by a king of Conjeeveram,
and was avenged by his two sons, who killed the <span class=
"pagenum">[118]king
and divided his body. The Kamm&#257;lan son took his head and used it
as a weighing pan, while the Balija son made a pedler&rsquo;s carpet
out of the skin, and threads out of the sinews for stringing bangles. A
quarrel arose, because each thought the other had got the best of the
division, and all the other castes joined in, and took the side of
either the Kamm&#257;lan or the Balija. Right and left hand
dancing-girls, temples, and mandapams, are still in existence at
Conjeeveram, and elsewhere in the Tamil country. Thus, at Tanjore,
there are the Kamm&#257;la T&#275;vadiy&#257;ls, or dancing-girls. As
the Kamm&#257;lans belong to the left-hand section, dancing-girls of
the right-hand section will not perform before them, or at their
houses. Similarly, musicians of the right-hand section will not play in
Kamm&#257;lan houses. In olden days, Kamm&#257;lans were not allowed to
ride in palanquins through the streets of the right hands. If they did,
a riot was the result. Such riots were common during the eighteenth
century. Thus, Fryer refers to one of these which occurred at
Masulipatam, when the contumacy of the Kamsalas (Telugu artisans) led
to their being put down by the other castes with the aid of the
Moors.
The Kamm&#257;lans call themselves &#256;ch&#257;ri and Paththar,
which are equivalent to the Br&#257;hman titles &#256;charya and
Bhatta, and claim a knowledge of the V&#275;das. Their own priests
officiate at marriages, funerals, and on other ceremonial occasions.
They wear the sacred thread, which they usually don on the Upakarmam
day, though some observe the regular thread investiture ceremony. Most
of them claim to be vegetarians. Non-Br&#257;hmans do not treat them as
Br&#257;hmans, and do not salute them with the namask&#257;ram
(obeisance). Their women, unlike those of other castes, throw the end
of their body-cloth [<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"
name="pb119">119]over the right shoulder, and are
conspicuous by the nose ornament known as the nattu.
In connection with the professional calling of the Kamm&#257;lans,
Surgeon-Major W. R. Cornish writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1743src" href="#xd21e1743" name="xd21e1743src">74 &ldquo;The
artisans, who are smiths or carpenters, usually bring up their children
to the same pursuits. It might have been supposed that the hereditary
influence in the course of generations would have tended to excellence
in the several pursuits, but it has not been so. Ordinary native work
in metal, stone, and wood, is coarse and rough, and the designs are of
the stereotyped form. The improvement in handicraft work of late years
has been entirely due to European influence. The constructors of
railways have been great educators of artisans. The quality of
stone-masonry, brick-work, carpentry, and smith-work has vastly
improved within the last twenty years, and especially in districts
where railway works have been in progress. The gold and silver smiths
of Southern India are a numerous body. Their chief employment consists
in setting and making native jewellery. Some of their designs are
ingenious, but here again the ordinary work for native customers is
often noticeable for a want of finish, and, with the exception of a few
articles made for the European markets, there is no evidence of
progressive improvement in design or execution. That the native artists
are capable of improvement as a class is evident from their skill and
ingenuity in copying designs set before them, and from the excellent
finish of their work under European supervision; but there must be a
demand for highly finished work before the goldsmiths will have
generally improved. The wearers of jewellery in India <span class=
"pagenum">[120]look
more to the intrinsic value of an article, than to the excellence of
the design or workmanship. So that there is very little encouragement
for artistic display.&rdquo; The collection of silver jewelry at the
Madras Museum, which was made in connection with the Colonial and
Indian Exhibition, London, 1886, bears testimony to the artistic skill
of the silversmiths. Recently, Colonel Townshend, Superintendent of the
Madras Gun Carriage Factory, has expressed his opinion<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1748src" href="#xd21e1748" name=
"xd21e1748src">75 that &ldquo;good as the Bombay smiths are, the
blacksmiths of Southern India are the best in Hindustan, and the pick
of them run English smiths very close, not only in skill, but in speed
of outturn.&rdquo;
Anyone who has seen the celebrated temples of Southern India, for
example, the Madura and Tanjore temples, and the carving on temple
cars, can form some idea of the skill of South Indian stone-masons and
carpenters. The following note on idols and idol-makers is taken from a
recent article.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1753src" href="#xd21e1753"
name="xd21e1753src">76 &ldquo;The idol-maker&rsquo;s craft, like
most of the other callings in this country, is a hereditary one, and a
workman who has earned some reputation for himself, or has had an
ancestor of renown, is a made man. The Sthapathi, as he is called in
Sanskrit, claims high social rank among the representatives of the
artisan castes. Of course he wears a heavy sacred thread, and affects
Br&#257;hman ways of living. He does not touch flesh, and liquor rarely
passes down his throat, as he recognises that a clear eye and steady
hand are the first essentials of success in his calling. There are two
sorts of idols in every temple, mulavigrahas or stone idols which are
fixed to the ground, and utsavavigrahas or metal idols used in
processions. [<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121]In the worst equipped pagoda there are at least
a dozen idols of every variety. They do duty for generations, for,
though they become black and begrimed with oil and ashes, they are
rarely replaced, as age and dirt but add to their sanctity. But now and
then they get desecrated for some reason, and fresh ones have to be
installed in their stead; or it may be that extensions are made in the
temple, and godlings in the Hindu Pantheon, not accommodated within its
precincts till then, have to be carved and consecrated. It is on such
occasions that the hands of the local Sthapathi are full of work, and
his workshop is as busy as a bee-hive. In the larger temples, such as
the one at Madura, the idols in which are to be counted by the score,
there are Sthapathis on the establishment receiving fixed emoluments.
Despite the smallness of the annual salary, the office of temple
Sthapathi is an eagerly coveted one, for, among other privileges, the
fortunate individual enjoys that of having his workshop located in the
temple premises, and thereby secures an advertisement that is not to be
despised. Besides, he is not debarred from adding to his pecuniary
resources by doing outside work when his hands are idle. Among stone
images, the largest demand is for representations of Ganapati or
Vignesvara (the elephant god), whose popularity extends throughout
India. Every hamlet has at least one little temple devoted to his
exclusive worship, and his shrines are found in the most unlikely
places. Travellers who have had occasion to pass along the sandy roads
of the Tanjore district must be familiar with the idols of the god of
the protuberant paunch, which they pass every half mile or so, reposing
under the shade of avenue trees with an air of self-satisfaction
suffusing their elephantine features. Among other idols called into
being for the purpose of [<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122]wayside installation in Southern
India, may be mentioned those of V&#299;ran, the Madura godling, who
requires offerings of liquor, M&#257;riamma, the small-pox goddess, and
the evil spirit Sangili Karappan. Representations are also carved of
n&#257;gas or serpents, and installed by the dozen round the village
asvatha tree (Ficus religiosa). Almost every week, the mail
steamer to Rangoon takes a heavy consignment of stone and metal idols
commissioned by the South Indian settlers in Burma for purposes of
domestic and public worship. The usual posture of mulavigrahas is a
standing one, the figure of Vishnu in the Srirangam temple, which
represents the deity as lying down at full length, being an exception
to this rule. The normal height is less than four feet, some idols,
however, being of gigantic proportions. Considering the very crude
material on which he works, and the primitive methods of stone-carving
which he continues to favour, the expert craftsman achieves quite a
surprising degree of smoothness and polish. It takes him several weeks
of unremitting toil to produce a vigraha that absolutely satisfies his
critical eye. I have seen him engaged for hours at a stretch on the
trunk of Vignesvara or the matted tuft of a Rishi. The casting of
utsavavigrahas involves a greater variety of process than the carving
of stone figures. The substance usually employed is a compound of
brass, copper and lead, small quantities of silver and gold being
added, means permitting. The required figure is first moulded in some
plastic substance, such as wax or tallow, and coated with a thin layer
of soft wet clay, in which one or two openings are left. When the clay
is dry, the figure is placed in a kiln, and the red-hot liquid metal is
poured into the hollow created by the running out of the melted wax.
The furnace is then [<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123]extinguished, the metal left to cool and
solidify, and the clay coating removed. A crude approximation to the
image required is thus obtained, which is improved upon with file and
chisel, till the finished product is a far more artistic article than
the figure that was enclosed within the clay. It is thus seen that
every idol is made in one piece, but spare hands and feet are supplied,
if desired. Whenever necessary, the Archaka (temple priest) conceals
the limbs with cloth and flowers, and, inserting at the proper places
little pieces of wood which are held in position by numerous bits of
string, screws on the spare parts, so as to fit in with the posture
that the idol is to assume during any particular procession.&rdquo;
An association, called the Visvakarma Kul&#257;bhimana Sabha, was
established in the city of Madras by the Kamm&#257;lans in 1903. The
objects thereof were the advancement of the community as a whole on
intellectual and industrial lines, the provision of practical measures
in guarding the interests, welfare and prospects of the community, and
the improvement of the arts and sciences peculiar to them by opening
industrial schools and workshops, etc.
Of proverbs relating to the artisan classes, the following may be
noted:&mdash;

The goldsmith who has a thousand persons to answer.
This in reference to the delay in finishing a job, owing to his taking
more orders than he can accomplish in a given time.
The goldsmith knows what ornaments are of fine gold, i.e.,
knows who are the rich men of a place.
It must either be with the goldsmith, or in the pot in which he
melts gold, i.e., it will be found somewhere in the house. Said
to one who is in search of something that cannot be found. <span class=
"pagenum">[124]
Goldsmiths put inferior gold into the refining-pot.
If, successful, pour it into a mould; if not, pour it into the
melting pot. The Rev. H. Jensen explains<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1787src" href="#xd21e1787" name="xd21e1787src">77 that the
goldsmith examines the gold after melting it. If it is free from dross,
he pours it into the mould; if it is still impure, it goes back into
the pot.
The goldsmith will steal a quarter of the gold of even his own
mother.
Stolen gold may be either with the goldsmith, or in his
fire-pot.
If the ear of the cow of a Kamm&#257;lan is cut and examined, some
wax will be found in it. It is said that the Kamm&#257;lan is in the
habit of substituting sealing-wax for gold, and thus cheating people.
The proverb warns them not to accept even a cow from a Kamm&#257;lan.
Or, according to another explanation, a Kamm&#257;lan made a figure of
a cow, which was so lifelike that a Br&#257;hman purchased it as a live
animal with his hard-earned money, and, discovering his mistake, went
mad. Since that time, people were warned to examine an animal offered
for sale by Kamm&#257;lans by cutting off its ears. A variant of the
proverb is that, though you buy a Kamm&#257;lan&rsquo;s cow only after
cutting its ears, he will have put red wax in its ears (so that, if
they are cut into, they will look like red flesh).
What has a dog to do in a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop? Said of a man who
attempts to do work he is not fitted for.
When the blacksmith sees that the iron is soft, he will raise
himself to the stroke.
Will the blacksmith be alarmed at the sound of a hammer?
[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125]
When a child is born in a blacksmith&rsquo;s family, sugar must be
dealt out in the street of the dancing-girls. This has reference to the
legendary relation of the Kamm&#257;lans and Kaik&#333;lans.
A blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, and the place in which donkeys roll
themselves, are alike.
The carpenters and blacksmiths are to be relegated, i.e., to
the part of the village called the Kamm&#257;lach&#275;ri.
What if the carpenter&rsquo;s wife has become a widow? This would
seem to refer to the former practice of widow remarriage.
The carpenter wants (his wood) too long, and the blacksmith wants
(his iron) too short, i.e., a carpenter can easily shorten a
piece of wood, and a blacksmith can easily hammer out a piece of
iron.
When a Kamm&#257;lan buys cloth, the stuff he buys is so thin that
it does not hide the hair on his legs.

Kamm&#257;lan (Malay&#257;lam).&mdash;&ldquo;The
Kamm&#257;lans of Malabar,&rdquo; Mr. Francis writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1827src" href="#xd21e1827" name="xd21e1827src">78
&ldquo;are artisans, like those referred to immediately above, but they
take a lower position than the Kamm&#257;lans and Kamsalas of the other
coast, or the P&#257;nch&#257;las of the Canarese country. They do not
claim to be Br&#257;hmans or wear the sacred thread, and they accept
the position of a polluting caste, not being allowed into the temples
or into Br&#257;hman houses. The highest sub-division is As&#257;ri,
the men of which are carpenters, and wear the thread at certain
ceremonies connected with house-building.&rdquo;
According to Mr. F. Fawcett &ldquo;the orthodox number of classes of
Kamm&#257;lans is five. But the artisans do not admit that the workers
in leather belong to the [<a id="pb126" href=
"#pb126" name="pb126">126]guild, and say that there are only
four classes. According to them, the fifth class was composed of
coppersmiths, who, after the exodus, remained in Izhuva land, and did
not return thence with them to Malabar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1834src" href="#xd21e1834" name="xd21e1834src">79
Nevertheless, they always speak of themselves as the Ayen Kudi or
five-house Kamm&#257;lans. The carpenters say that eighteen families of
their community remained behind in Izhuva land. Some of these returned
long afterwards, but they were not allowed to rejoin the caste. They
are known as Puzhi Tachan or sand carpenters, and Pathinettanmar or the
eighteen people. There are four families of this class now living at or
near Parpan gadi. They are carpenters, but the As&#257;ris treat them
as outcastes.&rdquo;
For the following note on Malabar Kamm&#257;lans I am indebted to
Mr. S. Appadorai Iyer. The five artisan classes, or Ayinkudi
Kamm&#257;lans, are made up of the following:&mdash;

As&#257;ri, carpenters.
M&#363;s&#257;ri, braziers.
Tatt&#257;n, goldsmiths.
Karum&#257;n, blacksmiths.
Chembotti or Chempotti, coppersmiths.

The name Chembotti is derived from chembu, copper, and kotti, he who
beats. They are, according to Mr. Francis, &ldquo;coppersmiths in
Malabar, who are distinct from the Malabar Kamm&#257;lans. They are
supposed to be descendants of men who made copper idols for temples,
and so rank above the Kamm&#257;lans in social position, and about
equally with the lower sections of the N&#257;yars.&rdquo;
The Kamm&#257;lans will not condescend to eat food at the hands of
Kurups, T&#333;lkollans, Pulluvans, Mann&#257;ns, or Tandans. But a
Tandan thinks it equally beneath [<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127]his dignity to accept food
from a Kamm&#257;lan. The Kamm&#257;lans believe themselves to be
indigenous in Malabar, and boast that their system of polyandry is the
result of the sojourn of the exiled P&#257;ndavas, with their common
wife P&#257;nch&#257;li, and their mother Kunthi, in the forest of the
Walluvan&#257;d division. They say that the destruction of the
P&#257;ndavas was attempted in the Arakkuparamba amsam of this
division, and that the Tac&rsquo;chans (artisans) were given as a
reward by the Kurus the enjoyment of Tacchanattukara amsam. They state
further that the P&#257;ndus lived for some time at the village of
Bh&#299;man&#257;d, and went to the Attap&#257;di valley, where they
deposited their cooking utensils at the spot where the water falls from
a height of several hundred feet. This portion of the river is called
Kuntipuzha, and the noise of the water, said to be falling on the upset
utensils, is heard at a great distance.
The Kamm&#257;lans, male and female, dress like N&#257;yars, and
their ornaments are almost similar to those of the N&#257;yars, with
this difference, that the female Tatt&#257;n wears a single chittu or
ring in the right ear only.
In the building of a house, the services of the As&#257;ri are
required throughout. He it is who draws the plan of the building. And,
when a door is fixed or beam raised, he receives his perquisite. The
completion of a house is signified as a rule by a kutti-poosa. For this
ceremony, the owner of the house has to supply the workmen with at
least four goats to be sacrificed at the four corners thereof, a number
of fowls to be killed so that the blood may be smeared on the walls and
ceiling, and an ample meal with liquor. The feast concluded, the
workmen receive presents of rings, gold ear-rings, silk and other
cloths, of which the Moothas&#257;ri or chief carpenter receives the
lion&rsquo;s share. &ldquo;The village [<a id=
"pb128" href="#pb128" name="pb128">128]carpenter,&rdquo; Mr.
Gopal Panikkar writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1866src" href=
"#xd21e1866" name="xd21e1866src">80 &ldquo;has to do everything
connected with our architecture, such as fixing poles or wickets at the
exact spot where buildings are to be erected, and clearing newly
erected buildings of all devils and demons that may be haunting them.
This he does by means of p&#363;jas (worship) performed after the
completion of the building. But people have begun to break through the
village traditions, and to entrust architectural work to competent
hands, when the village carpenter is found incompetent for the
same.&rdquo;
It is noted by Canter Visscher<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1871src"
href="#xd21e1871" name="xd21e1871src">81 that &ldquo;in commencing
the building of a house, the first prop must be put up on the east
side. The carpenters open three or four cocoanuts, spilling the juice
as little as possible, and put some tips of betel leaves into them;
and, from the way these float in the liquid, they foretell whether the
house will be lucky or unlucky, whether it will stand for a long or
short period, and whether another will ever be erected on its site. I
have been told that the heathens say that the destruction of fort
Paponetti by our arms was foretold by the builders from these
auguries.&rdquo;
The blacksmith is employed in the manufacture of locks and keys, and
ornamental iron and brasswork for the houses of the rich. The smithy is
near the dwelling hut, and the wife blows the bellows. The smith makes
tyres for wheels, spades, choppers, knives, sickles, iron spoons,
ploughshares, shoes for cattle and horses, etc. These he takes to the
nearest market, and sells there. In some places there are clever
smiths, who make excellent chellams (betel boxes) of brass, and there
is one man at Walluvan&#257;d who even makes stylographic pens.
[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129]
The M&#363;s&#257;ri works in bell-metal, and makes all kinds of
household utensils, and large vessels for cooking purposes. He is an
adept at making such articles with the proper proportions of copper,
lead and brass. In some of the houses of the wealthier classes there
are cooking utensils, which cost nearly a thousand rupees. Excellent
bell-metal articles are made at Cherpalcheri, and Kunhimangalam in
North Malabar is celebrated for its bell-metal lamps. The importation
of enamelled and aluminium vessels, and lamps made in Europe, has made
such inroads into the metal industry of the district that the brazier
and blacksmith find their occupation declining.
The goldsmith makes all kinds of gold ornaments worn by
Malai&#257;lis. His lot is better than that of the other artisan
classes.
It is noted in the Malabar Marriage Commission&rsquo;s report that
&ldquo;among carpenters and blacksmiths in the Calicut, Walluvan&#257;d
and Ponn&#257;ni taluks, several brothers have one wife between them,
although the son succeeds the father amongst them.&rdquo; Polyandry of
the fraternal type is said to be most prevalent among the blacksmiths,
who lead the most precarious existence, and have to observe the
strictest economy. As with the N&#257;yars, the t&#257;li-kettu
kaly&#257;nam has to be celebrated. For this the parents of the child
have to find a suitable manav&#257;lan or bridegroom by the
consultation of horoscopes. An auspicious day is fixed, and new cloths
are presented to the manav&#257;lan. The girl bathes, and puts on new
clothes. She and the manav&#257;lan are conducted to a pandal (booth),
where the t&#257;li-tying ceremony takes place. This concluded, the
manav&#257;lan takes a thread from the new cloth, and breaks it in two,
saying that his union with the girl has ceased. He then walks away
[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130]without looking back. When a Kamm&#257;lan
contemplates matrimony, his parents look out for a suitable bride. They
are received by the girl&rsquo;s parents, and enquiries are made
concerning her. The visit is twice repeated, and, when an arrangement
has been arrived at, the village astrologer is summoned, and the
horoscopes of the contracting parties are consulted. It is sufficient
if the horoscope of one of the sons agrees with that of the girl. The
parents of the sons deposit as earnest money, or &#257;chcharapanam,
four, eight, twelve, or twenty-one fanams according to their means, in
the presence of the artisans of the village; and a new cloth (kacha) is
presented to the bride, who thus becomes the wife of all the sons.
There are instances in which the girl, after the &#257;chcharam
marriage, is immediately taken to the husband&rsquo;s house. All the
brother-husbands, dressed in new clothes and decorated with ornaments,
with a new palmyra leaf umbrella in the hand, come in procession to the
bride&rsquo;s house, where they are received by her parents and
friends, and escorted to the marriage pandal. The bride and bridegrooms
sit in a row, and the girl&rsquo;s parents give them fruits and sugar.
This ceremony is called mathuram kotukkal. The party then adjourns to
the house of the bridegrooms where a feast is held, in the course of
which a ceremony called p&#257;l kotukkal is performed. The priest of
the Kamm&#257;lans takes some milk in a vessel, and pours it into the
mouths of the bride and bridegrooms, who are seated, the eldest on the
right, the others in order of seniority, and lastly the bride. During
the nuptials the parents of the bride have to present a water-vessel,
lamp, eating dish, cooking vessel, spittoon, and a vessel for drawing
water from the well. The eldest brother cohabits with the bride on the
wedding day, and special days are set apart for each brother.
[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131]There seems to be a belief among the
Kamm&#257;lan women that, the more husbands they have, the greater will
be their happiness. If one of the brothers, on the ground of
incompatibility of temper, brings a new wife, she is privileged to
cohabit with the other brothers. In some cases, a girl will have
brothers ranging in age from twenty-five to five, whom she has to
regard as her husband, so that by the time the youngest reaches puberty
she may be well over thirty, and a young man has to perform the duties
of a husband with a woman who is twice his age.
If a woman becomes pregnant before the &#257;chchara kaly&#257;nam
has been performed, her parents are obliged to satisfy the community
that her condition was caused by a man of their own caste, and he has
to marry the girl. If the paternity cannot be traced, a council is
held, and the woman is turned out of the caste. In the sixth or eighth
month of pregnancy, the woman is taken to her mother&rsquo;s house,
where the first confinement takes place. During her stay there the
pulikudi ceremony is performed. The husbands come, and present their
wife with a new cloth. A branch of a tamarind tree is planted in the
yard of the house, and, in the presence of the relations, the brother
of the pregnant woman gives her conji (rice gruel) mixed with the
juices of the tamarind, Spondias mangifera and Hibiscus,
to drink. The customary feast then takes place. A barber woman
(Mannathi) acts as midwife. On the fourteenth day after childbirth, the
Thali-kurup sprinkles water over the woman, and the Mannathi gives her
a newly-washed cloth to wear. Purification concludes with a bath on the
fifteenth day. On the twenty-eighth day the child-naming ceremony takes
place. The infant is placed in its father&rsquo;s lap, and in front of
it are set a [<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132]measure of rice and paddy (unhusked rice) on a
plantain leaf. A brass lamp is raised, and a cocoanut broken. The
worship of Gan&#275;sa takes place, and the child is named after its
grandfather or grandmother. In the sixth month the ch&#333;ronu or
rice-giving ceremony takes place. In the first year of the life of a
boy the ears are pierced, and gold ear-rings inserted. In the case of a
girl, the ear-boring ceremony takes place in the sixth or seventh year.
The right nostril of girls is also bored, and mukkuthi worn
therein.
It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of Malabar, that, &ldquo;amongst
Kamm&#257;lans, the betrothal ceremony is similar to that of the
Tiyans. If more than one brother is to be married, to the same girl,
her mother asks how many bridegrooms there are, and replies that there
are mats and planks for so many. Cohabitation sometimes begins from the
night of the betrothal, the eldest brother having the priority, and the
rest in order of seniority on introduction by the bride&rsquo;s
brother. If the girl becomes pregnant, the formal marriage must be
celebrated before the pregnancy has advanced six months. At the formal
marriage, the bridegrooms are received by the bride&rsquo;s mother and
brothers; two planks are placed before a lighted lamp, before which the
bridegrooms and the bride&rsquo;s brothers prostrate themselves. The
bride is dressed in a new cloth, and brought down by the
bridegroom&rsquo;s sister and fed with sweetmeats.
&ldquo;Next day all the bridegroom&rsquo;s party visit the
Tand&#257;n of the bride&rsquo;s desam (village), who has to give them
arrack (liquor) and meat, receiving in his turn a present of two fanams
(money). The next day the bride is again feasted in her house by the
bridegrooms, and is given her dowry consisting of four metal plates,
one [<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133]spittoon, one kindi (metal vessel), and a
bell-metal lamp. The whole party then goes to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
house, where the Tand&#257;n proclaims the titles of the parties and
their desam. All the brothers who are to share in the marriage sit in a
row on a mat with the bride on the extreme left, and all drink cocoanut
milk. The presence of all the bridegrooms is essential at this final
ceremony, though for the preceding formalities it is sufficient if the
eldest is present.&rdquo;
The Kammal&#257;ns burn the corpses of adults, and bury the young.
Fifteen days&rsquo; pollution is observed, and at the expiration
thereof the Thali-kurup pours water, and purification takes place. On
the third day the bones of the cremated corpse are collected, and
placed in a new earthen pot, which is buried in the grounds of the
house of the deceased. One of the sons performs beli (makes offerings),
and observes d&#299;ksha (hair-growing) for a year. The bones are then
carried to Tirunavaya in Ponn&#257;ni, Tiruvilamala in Cochin
territory, Per&#363;r in Coimbatore, or Tirunelli in the Wyn&#257;d,
and thrown into the river. A final beli is performed, and the
sr&#257;dh memorial ceremony is celebrated. If the deceased was skilled
in sorcery, or his death was due thereto, his ghost is believed to
haunt the house, and trouble the inmates. To appease it, the village
washerman (Mann&#257;n) is brought with his drums, and, by means of his
songs, forces the devil into one of the members of the household, who
is made to say what murthi or evil spirit possesses him, and how it
should be satisfied. It is then appeased with the sacrifice of a fowl,
and drinking the juice of tender cocoanuts. A further demand is that it
must have a place consigned to it in the house or grounds, and be
worshipped once a year. Accordingly, seven days later, a small stool
[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134]representing the deceased is placed in a corner
of one of the rooms, and there worshipped annually with offerings of
cocoanuts, toddy, arrack, and fowls. In the grounds of some houses
small shrines, erected to the memory of the dead, may be seen. These
are opened once a year, and offerings made to them.
The Kamm&#257;lans worship various minor deities, such as
Th&#299;kutti, Parakutti, Kala Bairavan, and others. Some only worship
stone images erected under trees annually. They have barbers of their
own, of whom the Mann&#257;n shaves the men, and the Mannathi the
women. These individuals are not admitted into the Mann&#257;n caste,
which follows the more honourable profession of washing clothes.
In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the following sub-castes of
Malabar Kamm&#257;lans are recorded:&mdash;Kallan Muppan and
Kallukkotti (stone-workers), Kott&#333;n (brass-smith), Pon Chetti
(gold merchant), and P&#363;lias&#257;ri (masons). In the Cochin Census
Report, 1901, it is stated that &ldquo;the Kamm&#257;lans are divided
into six sub-castes, viz., Mar&#257;s&#257;ri (carpenter),
Kallas&#257;ri (mason), M&#363;s&#257;ri (brazier), Kollan
(blacksmith), Tatt&#257;n (goldsmith), and T&#333;lkollan
(leather-worker). Of these six, the first five interdine, and
intermarry. The T&#333;lkollan is considered a degraded caste, probably
on account of his working in leather, which in its earlier stages is an
unholy substance. The other sub-castes do not allow the T&#333;lkollans
even to touch them. Among the Mar&#257;s&#257;ris are included the
Mar&#257;s&#257;ris proper and Tacchans. The Tacchans are looked upon
by other castes in the group as a separate caste, and are not allowed
to touch them. All the sub-castes generally follow the makkath&#257;yam
law of inheritance, but there are some vestiges of marumakkath&#257;yam
also among them. [<a id="pb135" href="#pb135"
name="pb135">135]There is a sub-caste called Kuruppu, who
are their barbers and priests. They officiate as priest at marriage and
funeral ceremonies. When they enter the interior shrine of temples for
work in connection with the image of a god, or with the temple
flagstaff, the As&#257;ri and M&#363;s&#257;ri temporarily wear a
sacred thread, which is a rare privilege. Their approach within a
radius of twenty-four feet pollutes Br&#257;hmans. On the completion of
a building, the Mar&#257;s&#257;ri, Kall&#257;s&#257;ri and Kollan
perform certain p&#363;jas, and sacrifice a fowl or sheep to drive out
the demons and devils which are supposed to have haunted the house till
then.&rdquo;
For the following note on the Kamm&#257;lans of Travancore, I am
indebted to Mr. N. Subramania Aiyar. &ldquo;The titles of the
Malay&#257;lam Kamm&#257;lans are Panikkan and Kanakkan. The word
Panikkan means a worker, and Kanakkan is the title given to a few old
and respectable Kamm&#257;las in every village, who superintend the
work of others, and receive the highest remuneration. It is their
business to sketch the plan of a building, and preside at the vastubali
rite. Many Tamil Kamm&#257;lans have naturalised themselves on the west
coast, and speak Malay&#257;lam. Between them and the Malay&#257;lam
Kamm&#257;lans neither intermarriage nor interdining obtains. The
latter are divided into five classes, viz., As&#257;ri or Marapanikkan
(workers in wood), Kallan or Kall&#257;s&#257;ri (workers in stone),
M&#363;s&#257;ri (braziers and coppersmiths), Tatt&#257;n (goldsmiths),
and Kollan (workers in iron). To these the J&#257;tinirnaya and
K&#275;ralavis&#275;sham&#257;h&#257;tmya add a sixth class, the
Tacchan or Irchchakollan, whose occupation is to fell trees and saw
timber. The Tacchans are also known as Villasans (bowmen), as they were
formerly required to supply bows and arrows for the Travancore army.
[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136]
Epigraphic records point to the existence of the five classes of
Kamm&#257;lans in Malabar at least as early as the beginning of the
ninth century A.D., as a Syrian Christian grant refers to them as
Aimvazhi Kamm&#257;las. There is a tradition that they were brought to
K&#275;rala by Parasu R&#257;ma, but left in a body for Ceylon on being
pressed by one of the early Perum&#257;l satraps of Crangan&#363;r to
marry into the washerman caste, after they had by a special arrangement
of the marriage shed trapped to death a large number of that obnoxious
community. The King of Ceylon was requested, as an act of international
courtesy, to send back some of the Kamm&#257;lans. As, however, they
were loth to return to their former persecutor, they were sent in
charge of some Izhavas, who formed the military caste of the island.
The legend is given in detail by Canter Visscher, who writes as
follows. &ldquo;In the time of Cheramperoumal, a woman belonging to the
caste of the washermen, whose house adjoined that of an Ajari (the
carpenter caste), being occupied as usual in washing a cloth in water
mixed with ashes (which is here used for soap), and having no one at
hand to hold the other end of it, called to a young daughter of the
Ajari, who was alone in the house, to assist her. The child, not
knowing that this was an infringement of the laws of her caste, did as
she was requested, and then went home. The washerwoman was emboldened
by this affair to enter the Ajari&rsquo;s house a few days afterwards;
and, upon the latter demanding angrily how she dared to cross his
threshold, the woman answered scornfully that he belonged now to the
same caste as she did, since his daughter had helped to hold her cloth.
The Ajari, learning the disgrace that had befallen him, killed the
washerwoman. Upon this, her friends complained to Cheramperoumal, who
espoused [<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137]their cause, and threatened the carpenters;
whereupon the latter combined together to take refuge in Ceylon, where
they were favourably received by the King of Candy, for whom the
Malabars have great veneration. Cheramperoumal was placed in great
embarrassment by their departure, having no one in his dominions who
could build a house or make a spoon, and begged the King of Candy to
send them back, promising to do them no injury. The Ajaris would not
place entire confidence in these promises, but asked the king to send
them with two Chegos (Ch&#333;gans) and their wives, to witness
Cheramperoumal&rsquo;s conduct towards them, and to protect them. The
king granted their request, with the stipulation that on all high
occasions, such as weddings and deaths and other ceremonies, the Ajaris
should bestow three measures of rice on each of these Chegos and their
descendants as a tribute for their protection; a custom which still
exists. If the Ajari is too poor to afford the outlay, he is still
obliged to present the requisite quantity of rice, which is then given
back to him again; the privilege of the Chegos being thus
maintained.
&ldquo;The Kamm&#257;lans are to some extent educated, and a few of
them have a certain knowledge of Sanskrit, in which language several
works on architecture are to be found. Their houses, generally known as
kottil, are only low thatched sheds. They eat fish and flesh, and drink
intoxicating liquors. Their jewelry is like that of the N&#257;yars,
from whom, however, they are distinguished by not wearing the nose
ornaments mukkutti and gnattu. Some in Central Travancore wear silver
mukkuttis. Tattooing, once very common, is going out of fashion.
&ldquo;In timber work the As&#257;ris excel, but the Tamil
Kamm&#257;lans have outstripped the Tatt&#257;ns in gold and
[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138]silver work. The house-building of the
As&#257;ri has a quasi-religious aspect. When a temple is built,
there is a preliminary rite known as anujgna, when the temple priest
transfers spiritual force from the image, after which a cow and calf
are taken thrice round the temple, and the Kanakkan is invited to enter
within for the purposes of work. The cow and calf are let loose in
front of the carpenter, who advances, and commences the work. On the
completion of a building, an offering known as vastubali is made. Vastu
is believed to represent the deity who presides over the house, and the
spirits inhabiting the trees which were felled for the purpose of
building it. To appease these supernatural powers, the figure of a
demon is drawn with powders, and the Kanakkan, after worshipping his
tutelary deity Bhadrak&#257;li, offers animal sacrifices to him in
non-Br&#257;hmanical houses, and vegetable sacrifices in Br&#257;hman
shrines and homes. An old and decrepit carpenter enters within the new
building, and all the doors thereof are closed. The Kanakkan from
without asks whether he has inspected everything, and is prepared to
hold himself responsible for any architectural or structural
shortcomings, and he replies in the affirmative. A jubilant cry is then
raised by all the assembled As&#257;ris. Few carpenters are willing to
undertake this dangerous errand, as it is supposed that the
dissatisfied demons are sure to make short work of the man who accepts
the responsibility. The figure is next effaced, and no one enters the
house until the auspicious hour of milk-boiling.
&ldquo;Vilkuruppu or Vilkollakkuruppu, who used formerly to supply
bows and arrows for the Malabar army, are the recognised priests and
barbers of the Kamm&#257;lans. They still make and present bows and
arrows at the [<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139]&#332;nam festival. In some places the
Kamm&#257;lans have trained members of their own caste to perform the
priestly offices. The Malay&#257;la Kamm&#257;lans, unlike the Tamils,
are not a thread-wearing class, but sometimes put on a thread when they
work in temples or at images. They worship K&#257;li, M&#257;tan, and
other divinities. Unlike the Tamil Kamm&#257;lans, they are a polluting
class, but, when they have their working tools with them, they are less
objectionable. In some places, as in South Travancore, they are
generally regarded as higher in rank than the Izhavas, though this is
not universal.
&ldquo;The t&#257;li-kettu ceremony is cancelled by a ceremony
called v&#257;zhippu, by which all connection between the
t&#257;li-tier and the girl is extinguished. The wedding ornament is
exactly the same as that of the Izhavas, and is known as the minnu
(that which shines). The system of inheritance is makkath&#257;yam. It
is naturally curious that, among a makkath&#257;yam community, paternal
polyandry should have been the rule till lately. &lsquo;The
custom,&rsquo; says Mateer, &lsquo;of one woman having several husbands
is sometimes practiced by carpenters, stone-masons, and individuals of
other castes. Several brothers living together are unable to support a
single wife for each, and take one, who resides with them all. The
children are reckoned to belong to each brother in succession in the
order of seniority.&rsquo; But this, after all, admits of explanation.
If only the marumakkath&#257;yam system of inheritance is taken, as it
should be, as a necessary institution in a society living in troublous
times, and among a community whose male members had duties and risks
which would not ordinarily permit of the family being perpetuated
solely through the male line, and not indicating any paternal
uncertainty as some theorists would have it; and if polyandry, which is
much [<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140]more recent than the marumakkath&#257;yam system
of inheritance, is recognised to be the deplorable result of indigence,
individual and national, and not of sexual bestiality, there is no
difficulty in understanding how a makkath&#257;yam community can be
polyandrous. Further, the manners of the Kamm&#257;lars lend a negative
support to the origin just indicated by the marumakkath&#257;yam system
of inheritance even among the N&#257;yars. The work of the
Kamm&#257;lars was within doors and at home, not even in a large
factory where power-appliances may lend an element of risk, for which
reason they found it quite possible to keep up lineage in the paternal
line, which the fighting N&#257;yars could not possibly do. And the
fact that the marumakkath&#257;yam system was ordained only for the
Kshatriyas, and for the fighting races, and not for the religious and
industrial classes, deserves to be specially noted in this
connection.&rdquo;
Kammara.&mdash;The Kammaras are the blacksmith section of the
Telugu Kamsalas, whose services are in great demand by the cultivator,
whose agricultural implements have to be made, and constantly repaired.
It is noted, in the Bellary Gazetteer, that &ldquo;until recently the
manufacture of the huge shallow iron pans, in which the sugar-cane is
boiled, was a considerable industry at K&#257;mal&#257;puram. The iron
was brought by pack bullocks from Jambunath Konda, the dome-shaped hill
at the Hospet end of the Sand&#363;r range, and was smelted and worked
by men of the Kammara caste. Of late years, the cheaper English iron
has completely ousted the country product, the smelting industry is
dead, and the Kammaras confine themselves to making and mending the
boilers with English material. They have a temple of their own,
dedicated to K&#257;li, in the village, where the worship is conducted
by one of themselves.&rdquo; The name [<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141]Baita Kammara,
meaning outside blacksmiths, is applied to Kamsala blacksmiths, who
occupy a lowly position, and work in the open air or outside a
village.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1944src" href="#xd21e1944" name=
"xd21e1944src">82
Kammiyan.&mdash;A Tamil name for blacksmiths.
Kampa (bush of thorns).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
Yerukala.
K&#257;mpo.&mdash;In the Manual of the Ganjam district, the
K&#257;mpos are described as Oriya agriculturists. In the Madras Census
Report, 1901, the name is taken as an Oriya form of K&#257;pu.
K&#257;mpu is the name for Savaras, who have adopted the customs of the
Hindu K&#257;mpos.
Kamsala.&mdash;The Kamsalas, or, as they are sometimes
called, Kamsaras, are the Telugu equivalent of the Tamil
Kamm&#257;lans. They are found northward as far as Berhampore in
Ganjam. According to tradition, as narrated in the note on
Kamm&#257;lans, they emigrated to the districts in which they now live
on the disruption of their caste by a certain king. The Kamsalas of
Vizagapatam, where they are numerically strong, say that, during the
reign of a Ch&#333;la king, their ancestors claimed equality with
Br&#257;hmans. This offended the king, and he ordered their
destruction. The Kamsalas fled northward, and some escaped death by
taking shelter with people of the Ozu caste. As an acknowledgment of
their gratitude to their protectors, some of them have Ozu added to
their house-names, e.g., Lakkozu, Kattozu, Patozu, etc.
The Kamsalas have territorial sub-divisions, such as
Murikin&#257;du, P&#257;kin&#257;du, Dr&#257;vida, etc. Like the
Kamm&#257;lans, they have five occupational sections, called Kamsali
(goldsmiths), Kanch&#257;ri or M&#363;s&#257;ri (brass-smiths),
Vadrangi [<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142](carpenters), and K&#257;si or Silpi
(stone-masons). In a note on the Kamsalas of the God&#257;vari
district, Mr. F. R. Hemingway writes that &ldquo;they recognise two
main divisions, called Des&#257;yi (indigenous) and Turpus&#257;kas
(easterns) or immigrants from Vizagapatam. They sometimes speak of
their occupational sub-divisions as g&#333;tras. Thus, San&#257;thana
is the iron, S&#257;naga, the wooden, Abh&#333;nasa, the brass,
Prathanasa, the stone, and Suparnasa, the gold g&#333;tra.&rdquo;
Intermarriage takes place between members of the different sections,
but the goldsmiths affect a higher social status than the blacksmiths,
and do not care to interdine or intermarry with them. They have taken
to calling themselves Br&#257;hmans, have adopted Br&#257;hmanical
g&#333;tras, and the Br&#257;hmanical form of marriage rites. They
quote a number of well-known verses of the Telugu poet V&#275;mana, who
satirised the Br&#257;hmans for their shortcomings, and refer to the
Sanskrit Mulastambam and Silpasastram, which are treatises on
architecture. They trace their descent from Visvakarma, the architect
of the gods. Visvakarma is said to have had five sons, of whom the
first was Kammarach&#257;rya. His wife was S&#363;r&#275;lavathi, the
daughter of Vasishta. The second was Vadlach&#257;ryudu. The third was
R&#363;dra or Kamchar&#257;ch&#257;rya of the Abhavansa g&#333;tra,
whose wife was Jal&#257;vathi, the daughter of Paulasthya Brahma. The
fourth was K&#257;s&#257;charyudu of the Prasnasa g&#333;tra. His wife
was Gun&#257;vati, the daughter of Visvavasa. The fifth was
Agas&#257;l&#257;ch&#257;rya or Chandra of the Suvarnasa g&#333;tra,
whose wife was Saunati, the daughter of Bhrigumah&#257;muni. Visvakarma
had also five daughters, of whom Sarasvathi was married to Brahma,
Sachi D&#275;vi to Indra, Mando Dari to R&#257;vana, and Ahalya to
Gautama. Since they were married to the d&#275;vatas, their descendants
acquired the title of [<a id="pb143" href=
"#pb143" name="pb143">143]Ach&#257;rya. The use of the
umbrella, sacred thread, golden staff, the insignia of Garuda, and the
playing of the bh&#275;ri were also allowed to them. It is recorded by
the Rev. J. Cain<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1973src" href="#xd21e1973"
name="xd21e1973src">83 that &ldquo;the so-called right-hand castes
object most strongly to the Kamsalilu being carried in a palki
(palanquin), and three years ago some of them threatened to get up a
little riot on the occasion of a marriage in the Kamsali caste. They
were deprived of this opportunity, for the palki was a borrowed one,
and its owner, more anxious for the safety of his property than the
dignity of the Kamsali caste, recalled the loan on the third day. A
ringleader of the discontented was a Madras Pariah. The Kamsalilu were
formerly forbidden to whitewash the outside of their houses, but
municipal law has proved stronger in this respect than Br&#257;hmanical
prejudice.&rdquo; The Kamsalas of Ganjam and Vizagapatam do not make
such a vigorous claim to be Br&#257;hmans, as do those further south.
They rear poultry, partake of animal food, do not prohibit the use of
alcoholic liquor, and have no g&#333;tras. They also have sub-divisions
among them, which do not wear the sacred thread, and work outside the
village limits. Thus, the Karamalas are a section of blacksmiths, who
do not wear the sacred thread. Similarly, the Baita Kammaras are
another section of blacksmiths, who do not wear the thread, and, as
their name implies, work outside the village. In Vizagapatam, almost
the only castes which will consent to receive food at the hands of
Kamsalas are the humble M&#257;las and Rellis. Even the Ts&#257;kalas
and Yatas will not do so. There is a popular saying that the Kamsalas
are of all castes seven visses (viss, a measure of weight) less.

In 1885, a criminal revision case came before the High Court of
Madras, in which a goldsmith performed abish&#275;kam by pouring
cocoanut-water over a lingam. In his judgment, one of the Judges
recorded that &ldquo;the facts found are that 1st accused, a goldsmith
by caste, on the night of the last Mah&#257;sivar&#257;tri, entered a
Siva temple at Vizagapatam, and performed abish&#275;kam, i.e.,
poured cocoanut-water over the lingam, the 2nd and 3rd accused
(Br&#257;hmans) reciting mantrams (sacred formul&aelig;) while he did
so. Another Br&#257;hman who was there expostulated with 1st accused,
telling him that he, a goldsmith, had no right to perform
abish&#275;kam himself, upon which 1st accused said that it was he who
made the idol, and he was fit to perform abish&#275;kam. An outcry
being raised, some other Br&#257;hmans came up, and objected to 1st
accused performing abish&#275;kam, and he was turned out, and some ten
rupees spent in ceremonies for the purification of the idol. The
2nd-class Magistrate convicted the 1st accused under sections 295 and
296, Indian Penal Code, and the 2nd and 3rd accused of abetment. All
these convictions were reversed on appeal by the District Magistrate.
There was certainly no evidence that any of the accused voluntarily
caused disturbance to an assembly engaged in the performance of
religious worship or religious ceremonies, and therefore a conviction
under section 296 could not be supported. In order to support a
conviction under section 295, it would be necessary for the prosecution
to prove (1) that the accused &lsquo;defiled&rsquo; the lingam, and (2)
that he did so, knowing that a class of persons, viz., the
Br&#257;hmans, would consider such defilement as an insult to their
religion. It may be noted that the 1st accused is a person of the same
religion as the Br&#257;hmans, and, therefore, if the act be an insult
at all, it was an insult to [<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145]his own religion. The act of
defilement alleged was the performance of abish&#275;kam, or the
pouring of cocoanut-water over the lingam. In itself, the act is
regarded as an act of worship and meritorious, and I understand that
the defilement is alleged to consist in the fact that the 1st accused
was not a proper person&mdash;not being a Br&#257;hman&mdash;to perform
such a ceremony, but that he ought to have got some Br&#257;hman to
perform it for him.&rdquo; The other Judge (Sir T. Muttusami Aiyar)
recorded that &ldquo;in many temples in this Presidency, it is not
usual for worshippers generally to touch the idol or pour
cocoanut-water upon it, except through persons who are specially
appointed to do so, and enjoined to observe special rules of
cleanliness. If the accused knew that the temple, in the case before
us, is one of those temples, and if he did the act imputed to him to
ridicule openly the established rule in regard to the purity of the
lingam as an object of worship, it might then be reasonably inferred
that he did the act wantonly, and with the intention of insulting the
religious notions of the general body of worshippers. The
Sub-Magistrate refers to no specific evidence in regard to the
accused&rsquo;s knowledge of the usage. I may also observe that, in
certain temples attended by the lower classes, the slaughtering of
sheep is an act of worship. But, if the same act is done in other
temples to which other classes resort as places of public worship, it
is generally regarded as a gross outrage or defilement.&rdquo; The High
Court upheld the decision of the District Magistrate.
Each occupational sub-division of the Kamsalas has a headman styled
Kulampedda, and occasionally the five headmen assemble for the
settlement of some important question of general interest to the
community. [<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=

A Kamsala may, according to the custom called m&#275;narikam, claim
his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter in marriage. The following account
of the wedding rites is given in the Nellore Manual. &ldquo;The
relations of the bridegroom first go to the bride&rsquo;s parents or
guardians, and ask their consent to the proposed union. If consent is
given, a day is fixed, on which relations of the bridegroom go to the
bride&rsquo;s house, where all her relations are present with
cocoanuts, a cloth for the bride, betel, turmeric, etc. On the same
occasion, the amount of the dower is settled. The bride bathes, and is
adorned with flowers, turmeric, etc., and puts on the new cloth brought
for her, and she receives the articles which the bridegroom&rsquo;s
party have brought. On the auspicious day appointed for the marriage,
the relations of the bride go to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, and
fetch him in a palanquin. A Br&#257;hman is sent for, who performs the
ceremonies near the dais on which the bride and bridegroom are seated.
After the recital of the mantras (hymns) before the young couple, he
sends for their uncles, and blesses them. The bridegroom then ties a
pilgrim&rsquo;s cloth upon him, places a brass water-pot on his head,
holds a torn umbrella in his hands, and starts out from the pandal
(booth), and says he is going on a pilgrimage to Benares, when the
bride&rsquo;s brother runs after him, and promises that he will give
his sister in marriage, swearing thrice to this effect. The bridegroom,
satisfied with this promise, abandons his pretended journey, takes off
his pilgrim cloths, and gives them, with the umbrella, to the
Br&#257;hman. The couple seat themselves on the dais, and the
Br&#257;hman, having repeated some mantras, gives a sacred thread to
the bridegroom to place over his shoulders. He then blesses the
mangalasutram (marriage badge corresponding to <span class=
"pagenum">[147]the
Tamil t&#257;li), and hands it to the bridegroom, who ties it round the
bride&rsquo;s neck, his sister or other elderly matron seeing that it
is properly tied. The bride&rsquo;s father comes forward, and, placing
his daughter&rsquo;s right hand in the bridegroom&rsquo;s right, pours
water on them. The other ceremonies are exactly similar to those
practiced by the Br&#257;hmans.&rdquo; Girls are invariably married
before puberty. Widows are not allowed to remarry, and divorce is not
recognised.
The Kamsalas are either M&#257;dhvas, Saivites, or Ling&#257;yats.
All revere the caste goddess K&#257;m&#257;kshi Amma, who is
represented by each sub-division in a special manner. Thus the
Kanch&#257;ra represents her by the stone on which he beats his metal
work, the goldsmith by one of his implements, and the blacksmith by his
bellows. On the eighteenth day of the Dasara festival, an annual
festival is celebrated in honour of the goddess.
The dead are buried in a seated posture, but, in recent years, some
Kamsalas have taken to cremation. The death rites closely follow the
Br&#257;hmanical form. Death pollution is observed for twelve days.
In the Vizagapatam district, some artisans are engaged in the
ivory-carving industry. They &ldquo;manufacture for European clients
fancy articles, such as chess-boards, photograph frames, card-cases,
trinket boxes, and so on, from tortoise-shell, horn, porcupine quills,
and ivory. The industry is in a flourishing state, and has won many
medals at exhibitions. It is stated to have been introduced by Mr.
Fane, who was Collector of the district from 1859 to 1862, and to have
then been developed by the Kamsalis, and men of other castes who
eventually took it up. The foundation of the fancy articles is usually
sandal-wood, which is imported from [<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148]Bombay. Over this are
laid porcupine quills split in half and placed side by side, or thin
slices of &lsquo;bison,&rsquo; buffalo, or stag horn, tortoise-shell,
or ivory. The ivory is sometimes laid over the horn or shell, and is
always either cut into geometrical patterns with a small key-hole saw,
or etched with designs representing gods and flowers. The etching is
done with a small V tool, and then black wax is melted into the design
with a tool like a soldering iron, any excess being scraped off with a
chisel, and the result is polished with a leaf of <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Ficus asperrima (the leaves of which are very rough, and
used as a substitute for sand-paper). This gives a black design
(sgraffito) on a white ground. The horn and porcupine quills are
obtained from the Agency, and the tortoise-shell and ivory mainly from
Bombay through the local Marvaris. The designs employed both in the
etching and fret-work are stiff, and suited rather to work in metal
than in ivory; and the chief merit of this Vizagapatam work perhaps
lies in its careful finish&mdash;a rare quality in Indian objects of
art. The ivory is rarely carved now, but, in the Calcutta Museum and
elsewhere, may be seen samples of the older Vizagapatam work, which
often contained ivory panels covered with scenes from holy writ,
executed in considerable relief.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

The caste title of the Kamsalas is usually Ayya, but, in recent
times, a good many have taken the title Ach&#257;ri.
The two begging castes Panasa and Runja are stated by Mr. Hemingway
to be exclusively devoted to the Kamsalas. &ldquo;The former,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;are said to be out-castes from the K&#333;mati
sub-division of that name. Formerly in the service of the Nizam, it is
said they [<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149]were disgraced by him, and driven to accept food
of a degrading nature from a Kamsala. The Kamsalas accordingly took
them under their protection. The Runjas are said to have been specially
created by Siva. Siva had killed a giant named Ravundasura, and the
giant&rsquo;s dying request was that his limbs might be turned into
musical instruments, and a special caste created to play them at the
celebration of Siva&rsquo;s marriage. The Runjas were the caste
created. The god ordered Viswakarma, the ancestor of the Kamsalas, to
support them, and the Kamsalas say that they have inherited the
obligation.&rdquo;
It is recorded, in the Kurnool Manual, that &ldquo;the story goes
that in Golkonda a tribe of K&#333;matis named Bacheluvaru were
imprisoned for non-payment of arrears of revenue. Finding certain men
of the artificer caste, who passed by in the street, spit chewed
betel-nut, they got it into their mouths, and begged the artificers to
get them released. The artificers pitied them, paid the arrears, and
procured their release. It was then that the Kamsalis fixed a vartana
or annual house fee for the maintenance of the Panasa class, on
condition that they should not beg alms from the other
castes.&rdquo;

Kanakkan.&mdash;Kanakkan is a Tamil accountant caste,
corresponding to the Oriya Korono. In an account thereof, in the North
Arcot Manual, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes that they are &ldquo;found
chiefly in the districts of North Arcot, South Arcot, and Chingleput.
The name is derived from the Tamil word kanakku, which means an
account. They were employed as village accountants by the ancient
kings. In the inscriptions the word Karanam or Kanakkan occurs very
often, and their title is invariably given as V&#275;l&#257;n, which is
possibly a contracted form of Vell&#257;lan. These accountants of the
Tamil districts seem to be quite distinct from those of Ganjam and
other Telugu provinces (see Korono), some of whom claim to be
Kshatriyas, or even Br&#257;hmans. It is true that the Karnams
themselves claim to be the sons of Brahma, but others maintain that
they are the offspring of a S&#363;dra woman by a Vaisya. The caste is
said to have four divisions, S&#299;r (Sr&#299;), Sarattu, Kaikatti,
and S&#333;lia. The S&#299;r Karnams are considered of highest rank,
and are generally the most intelligent accountants, though they are
sadly deficient when compared with the Br&#257;hmans who perform the
duty of keeping the village accounts above the gh&#257;ts. The
Kai-katti Karnams (or Karnams who show the hand) derive their name from
a peculiar custom existing among them, by which a daughter-in-law is
never allowed to speak to her mother-in-law except by signs. The reason
may perhaps be surmised. The members of the four divisions cannot
intermarry. In their customs the caste is somewhat peculiar. They wear
the thread, disallow liquor-drinking, flesh-eating, and widow
remarriage. Most of them worship Siva, but there are some who are
Vaishnavites, and a very few are Ling&#257;yats.&rdquo; Their title is
Pillai. In the records relating to the Tamil country, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151]Conicopoly, Conicoply, Canacappel, and other
variants appear as a corrupt form of Kanakka Pillai. For example, in
the records of Fort St. George, 1680, it is noted that
&ldquo;the Governour, accompanyed with the
Councell and several persons of the factory, attended by six files of
soldyers, the Company&rsquo;s Peons, 300 of the Washers, the Pedda
Naigue, the Cancoply of the Towne and of the grounds, went the circuit
of Madras ground, which was described by the Cancoply of the
grounds.&rdquo; It is recorded by Bald&aelig;us (1672) that
Xaverius set everywhere teachers called Canacappels.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2049src" href="#xd21e2049" name="xd21e2049src">85 The
title Conicopillay is still applied to the examiner of accounts by the
Corporation of Madras.
It is laid down in the Village Officers&rsquo; Manual that
&ldquo;the Karnam, who is entrusted with the keeping of village
accounts, is subordinate to the Head of the village. He should help and
advise the Head of the village in every way. He is the clerk of the
Head of the village in his capacity of village munsif and magistrate.
He has to prepare reports, accounts, statements, etc., which it is
necessary to put in writing.&rdquo; When sudden or unnatural death
takes place within the limits of a village, the Karnam takes down in
writing the evidence of persons who are examined, and frames a report
of the whole proceedings. He keeps the register of those who are
confined, or placed in the stocks by the Head of the village for
offences of a trivial nature, such as using abusive language, or petty
assaults or affrays. It is the Karnam who keeps the revenue accounts,
and registers of the price of all kinds of grain, strangers passing or
re-passing through the village, births and deaths, and cattle mortality
when cattle disease, e.g., anthrax or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152]rinderpest, exists. Further, it is the duty of
the Karnam to take proper care of Government survey instruments, and,
when revenue survey is being carried out, to satisfy himself that the
village and field boundary marks are properly erected.
In their marriage and death ceremonies, the Kanakkans closely follow
the Tamil Pur&#257;nic type as observed by Vell&#257;las. The Kaikatti
section, however, has one peculiar custom. After the marriage ceremony,
the girl is kept inside the house, and not allowed to move about
freely, for at least two or three days. She is considered to be under
some kind of pollution. It is said that, in former times, she was
confined in the house for forty days, and, as occupation, had to
separate dhal (peas) and rice, which had been mixed together.
The following proverbs are not complimentary to the Kanakkan, who,
as an influential village official, is not always a popular
individual:&mdash;
Though babies are sold for a pie each, we do not want a Kanakka
baby.
Wherever you meet with a Kanakka child or with a crow&rsquo;s young
one, put out its eyes.
In Travancore, Kanakkan is a name by which Kamm&#257;lans are
addressed, and a prefix to the name of Todup&#363;zha Vell&#257;las. It
further occurs, on the west coast, as a sub-division of Cheruman or
Pulayan.
For the following note on the Kanakkans of the Cochin State, I am
indebted to Mr. L. K. Anantha Krishna Aiyar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2072src" href="#xd21e2072" name="xd21e2072src">86
The Kanakkans belong to the slave castes, and are even now attached
to some landlords. In the t&#257;luks of Trich&#363;r, Mukandapuram,
and Crangan&#363;r, where I [<a id="pb153" href=
"#pb153" name="pb153">153]obtained all my information about
them, I learnt that they are the Atiyars (slaves) of Chitt&#363;r
Manakkal Namb&#363;diripad at Perumanom near Trich&#363;r, and they owe
him a kind of allegiance. The Namb&#363;diri landlord told me that the
members of the caste, not only from almost all parts of the State, but
also from the British t&#257;luks of Ponn&#257;ni, Chowghat, and even
from Calicut, come to him with a Thirumulkazhcha, i.e., a few
annas in token of their allegiance. This fact was also confirmed by a
Kanakkanar (headman) at Crangan&#363;r, who told me that he and his
castemen were the slaves of the same landlord, though, in disputes
connected with the caste, they abide by the decision of the local
R&#257;ja. In the event of illness or calamity in the family of a
Kanakkan, an astrologer (Kaniyan), who is consulted as to the cause and
remedy, sometimes reminds the members thereof of the negligence in
their allegiance to the landlord, and suggests the advisability of
paying respects to him (Nambikuru) with a few annas. On the Puy&#257;m
day in Makaram (January-February), these people from various parts of
the State present themselves in a body with a few annas each, to own
their allegiance to him. The following story is mentioned by him. One
of his ancestors chanced to pay his respects to one of the rulers of
the State, when the residence of the Royal Family was in Cochin. On
arriving near the town, the boat capsised in a storm, but was luckily
saved by the bravery of a few rowers of this caste. The R&#257;ja, who
witnessed the incident from a window of his palace, admired their
valour, and desired to enlist some Kanakkans into his service.
There are four endogamous sub-divisions among the Kanakkans, viz.,
Patunna, the members of which formerly worked in salt-pans, Vettuva,
Chavala, and [<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154]Par&#257;ttu. Each of these is further
sub-divided into clans (kiriyam), which are exogamous.
A young man may marry the daughter of his maternal uncle, but this
is not permissible in some places. Marriage is both infant and adult,
and may be celebrated by Patunna Kanakkans at any time between the
tenth and thirteenth years of a girl, while the Vettuva Kanakkans may
celebrate it only after girls attain puberty. They often choose the
bridegroom beforehand, with the intention of performing the ceremony
after puberty.
When a girl attains maturity, she is kept apart in a part of the
house on the score of pollution, which lasts for seven days. She bathes
on the fourth day. On the morning of the seventh day seven girls are
invited, and they accompany the girl to a tank (pond) or a river. They
all have an oil bath, after which they return home. The girl, dressed
and adorned in her best, is seated on a plank in a conspicuous part of
the hut, or in a pandal (booth) put up for the time in front of it. A
small vessel full of paddy<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2090src" href=
"#xd21e2090" name="xd21e2090src">87 (nerapara), a cocoanut, and a
lighted lamp, are placed in front of her. Her Enangan begins his
musical tunes, and continues for an hour or two, after which he takes
for himself the above things, while his wife, who has purified the girl
by sprinkling cow-dung water, gets a few annas for her service. It is
now, at the lucky moment, that the girl&rsquo;s mother ties the
t&#257;li round her neck. The seven girls are fed, and given an anna
each. The relations, and other castemen who are invited, are treated to
a sumptuous dinner. The guests as they depart give a few annas each to
the chief host, to meet the expenses of the ceremony and the feast.
This old custom of mutual help prevails largely among <span class=
"pagenum">[155]the
Pulayas also. The girl is now privileged to enter the kitchen, and
discharge her domestic duties. The parents of the bridegroom contribute
to the ceremony a small packet of jaggery (crude sugar), a muri (piece
of cloth), some oil and incha (Acacia Intsia), the soft fibre of
which is used as soap. This contribution is called bhendu nyayam. If
the girl is married before puberty, and she attains her maturity during
her stay with her husband, the ceremony is performed in his hut, and
the expenses are met by the parents of the bridegroom, while those of
the bride contribute a share.
When a Vettuva Kanakka girl comes of age, the headman
(Vatik&#257;ran) of the caste is informed. He comes, along with his
wife, to help the girl&rsquo;s parents in the performance of the
ceremony. Seven girls are invited. Each of them breaks a cocoanut, and
pours the water on the girl&rsquo;s head. Water is also poured over
her. As soon as she is thus bathed, she is allowed to remain in a room,
or in a part of the hut. Near her are placed a mirror made of metal, a
vessel of paddy, a pot full of water, and a lighted lamp. The young man
who has been chosen as her husband is invited. He has to climb a
cocoanut tree to pluck a tender cocoanut for the girl, and a cluster of
flowers. He then takes a meal in the girl&rsquo;s hut, and departs. The
same proceedings are repeated on the fourth day, and, on the seventh
day, he takes the cluster of flowers, and throws it on water.
As soon as a young man is sufficiently old, his parents look out for
a girl as his wife. When she is chosen, the <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2102" title="Source: negociations">negotiations leading to
marriage are opened by the father of the bridegroom, who, along with
his brother-in-law and Enangan (relations by marriage), goes to the
house of the bride-elect, where, in the midst of relations and friends
previously assembled, [<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156]the formal arrangements are made,
and a portion of the bride&rsquo;s money is also paid. The auspicious
day for the wedding is settled, and the number of guests to be invited
is fixed. There is also an entertainment for those that are assembled.
A similar one is also held at the hut of the bridegroom-elect. These
people are too poor to consult the local Kaniyan (astrologer); but, if
it is known that the couple were born on the day of the same
constellation, the match is at once rejected. On the day chosen for the
celebration of the marriage, the bridegroom, neatly dressed, and with a
knife and stylus, sets out from his hut, accompanied by his parents,
uncles, other relatives, and men of his village, to the hut of the
bride, where they are welcomed, and seated on mats in a pandal (booth)
put up for the occasion. The bride, somewhat veiled, is taken to the
pandal and seated along with the bridegroom, and to both of them a
sweet preparation of milk, sugar and plantain fruits is given, to
establish the fact that they have become husband and wife. There is no
t&#257;li-tying then. The guests are treated to a sumptuous dinner. As
they take leave of the chief host, each of them pays a few annas to
meet the expenses of the ceremony. The bridegroom, with the bride and
those who have accompanied him, returns to his hut, where some
ceremonies are gone through, and the guests are well fed. The
bridegroom and bride are seated together, and a sweet preparation is
given, after which the parents and the maternal uncle of the former,
touching the heads of both, says &ldquo;My son, my daughter, my nephew,
my niece,&rdquo; meaning that the bride has become a member of their
family. They throw rice on their heads as a token of their blessings on
them. After this, the couple live together as man and wife. In some
places, marriage is performed by proxy. [<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157]A young Vettuva
Kanakkan cannot marry by proxy. Neither can the t&#257;li-tying
ceremony be dispensed with.
If a woman has abandoned herself to a member of a lower caste, she
is put out of caste, and becomes a Christian or Muhammadan. Adultery is
regarded with abhorrence. All minor offences are dealt with by the
headman, whose privileges are embodied in a Th&#299;turam (royal
order), according to which he may preside at marriage, funeral, and
other ceremonies, and obtain a small fee as remuneration for his
services. He may use a stick, a stylus, and a knife lined with gold. He
may wear a white coat, turban and ear-rings, and use an umbrella. He
may also construct a shed with six posts for marriage ceremonies. He
has to pay a tax of ten annas to the Sirkar (Government). Chitt&#363;r
Manakkal Namb&#363;diripad in the t&#257;luk of Talapilly, the
Crangan&#363;r R&#257;ja in the t&#257;luk of Crangan&#363;r, and His
Highness the Mahar&#257;ja exercise absolute powers in the settlement
of disputes connected with this and other castes.
The Kanakkans believe in magic, sorcery, and witchcraft. Persons who
practice the art are very rare among them. They go to a P&#257;nan,
V&#275;lan, or Parayan, whenever they require his services. They
profess Hinduism, and worship Siva, Vishnu, Ganapathi, and Subramania,
M&#363;kkan, Ch&#257;than, Kandakaranan, and the spirits of their
ancestors are also adored. Vettuva Kanakkans do homage to Kappiri and
V&#299;rabhadran also. Ch&#257;than cannot be worshipped at
Crangan&#363;r, as he is opposed to the local deity. Wooden or brass
images of their ancestors are kept in their huts, to whom regular
sacrifices are offered on Karkadagom, Thulam, and Makaram Sankranthis.
In their compounds is often seen a raised platform beneath a tree, on
which are placed a few stones representing the images of the
[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158]demons whom they much fear and respect.
Sacrifices are offered to them on leaves.
Patunna Kanakkans invariably bury their dead. The funeral rites are
similar to those observed by other low castes. Death pollution lasts
for fifteen days. On the sixteenth morning, the hut and compound are
swept and cow-dunged. The relatives and castemen are invited, and bring
some rice and curry stuffs for a feast. Along with the chief mourner
(the son of the deceased) and his brothers, they go to the nearest tank
or river to bathe. The Enangan of the family purifies them by the
sprinkling of cow-dung water. They return home, and those assembled are
treated to a grand dinner. The son observes the diksha (mourning)
either for forty-one days, or for a whole year, after which a grand
feast called Masam is celebrated.
The Kanakkans are employed in fishing in the backwaters, cutting
timber and floating it on bamboo rafts down rivers flooded during the
monsoon, boating, pumping out water from rice fields by means of
water-wheels, and all kinds of agricultural labour. They were at one
time solely engaged in the manufacture of salt from the backwaters.
Women are engaged in making coir (cocoanut fibre) and in agricultural
labour. Vettuva Kanakkans are engaged in cocoanut cultivating, and
making lime out of shells. They are very skilful in climbing cocoanut
trees for plucking cocoanuts.
The Kanakkans take food prepared by members of the higher castes,
and by Kamm&#257;lans, Izhuvas, and M&#257;ppillas. They have a strong
objection to eating at the hands of Veluth&#275;dans (washermen),
Velakkathalavans (barbers), P&#257;nans, V&#275;lans, and Kaniyans.
Pulayas, Ulladans, and Nay&#257;dis have to stand far away <span class=
"pagenum">[159]from
them. They themselves have to keep at a distance of 48 feet from high
caste Hindus. They pollute Izhuvas by touch, and Kamm&#257;lans and
Valans at a short distance. They cannot approach the temples of the
higher castes, but take part in the festivals of temples in rural
parts. At Crangan&#363;r, they can come as far as the kozhikallu, which
is a stone outside the temple at a short distance from it, on which
fowls are offered by low caste people.
Kanakku.&mdash;A prefix to the name of N&#257;yars,

The dead are either cremated, or buried in a recumbent posture.
Br&#257;hmans officiate as their priests. The use of spirituous
liquors, and flesh and fish is permitted. Bell-metal is largely used
for making household utensils, such as lamps, goglets, basins, jugs,
etc. The process of manufacturing these articles is as follows. The
moulds are made of clay, dried and coated with wax to the thickness of
the articles required, and left to dry again, a hole being made in them
so as to allow the wax to flow out when heated. After this has been
done, the molten metal is poured in. The moulds are then broken, and
the articles taken out and polished.&rdquo;

Kangara.&mdash;The word Kangara means servant, and the
Kangaras (or Khongars) were <span class="corr" id="xd21e2175" title=
"Source: orginally">originally village watchmen in the
Vizagapatam Agency tracts, corresponding to the K&#257;valgars of the
Tamil country. They are described as follows by Lieutenant J. Macdonald
Smith, who was Assistant Agent to the Governor in Jeypore in the
sixties of the last century. &ldquo;A Khongar, it seems, is nothing but
a K&#257;vilgar or village watchman. That these people, in many parts
of India, are little better than a community of thieves, is pretty well
known, and what was the true nature of the system in Jeypore was very
clearly brought to light in a case which was committed to my Court. It
was simply this. Before [<a id="pb161" href=
"#pb161" name="pb161">161]we entered the country, the entire
police and magisterial authority of a t&#257;luk was lodged in the
revenue ameen or renter. Whenever a theft occurred, and the property
was of sufficient importance to warrant the trouble and expense, the
traveller or householder, as the case might be, resorted at once to the
ameen, who (if sufficiently <span class="corr" id="xd21e2180" title=
"Source: feed">fed by the complainant) forthwith sent for the
Head Khongar of the quarter, and desired him to recover the goods,
whatever they might be. The Khongar generally knows very well where to
lay his hand on the property, and would come back with such portion of
it as the urgency of the ameen&rsquo;s order seemed to require, while
the zeal of that functionary of course varied in each case, according
to the extent of the gratification the complainant seemed disposed to
give. This is the Khongar system of Jeypore in its length and breadth,
as proved at the trial referred to. Wherever a t&#257;luk is taken up
by the Police, the system of course falls down of itself. As for the
Khongars, they willingly enlist in our village constabulary, and are
proving themselves both intelligent and fearless.&rdquo; The Meriah
Officers (1845&ndash;61) remarked that the former R&#257;jas of
Jeypore, and their subordinate chiefs, retained in their service great
numbers of professional robbers, called Khongars, whom they employed
within the Jeypore country, and in the plains, on expeditions of rapine
and bloodshed.
The Khongars were generally Paidis by caste, and their descendants
are even now the most notorious among the dacoits of the Vizagapatam
district. Their methods are thus described in the Gazetteer of the
Vizagapatam district (1907). &ldquo;Like the Konda Doras, they have
induced some of the people to employ watchmen of their caste as the
price of immunity from theft. [<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162]They are connected with the
Dombus of the R&#257;yagada and Gunupur t&#257;luks, who are even
worse. These people dacoit houses at night in armed gangs of fifty or
more, with their faces blackened to prevent recognition. Terrifying the
villagers into staying quiet in their huts, they force their way into
the house of some wealthy person (for choice the local Sondi,
liquor-seller and sowcar<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2187src" href=

from his neighbours when forced to disgorge), tie up the men, rape the
women, and go off with everything of value. Their favourite method of
extracting information regarding concealed property is to sprinkle the
house-owner with boiling oil.&rdquo;

Travancore. Till recently they were in the habit of sending all their
women into the seclusion of the dense jungle on the arrival of a
stranger near their settlements. But this is now seldom done, and some
K&#257;nikars have in modern times settled in the vicinity of towns,
and become domesticated. The primitive short, dark-skinned and
platyrhine type, though surviving, has become changed as the result of
contact metamorphosis, and many leptorhine or mesorhine individuals
above middle height are to be met with. [<a id=

The K&#257;nikars are said to be characterised by a high standard of
honour, and to be straightforward, honest and truthful. They are good
trackers and fond of sport, and in clearing forest paths they have
hardly any equals. Their help and guidance are sought by, and willingly
given to any person who may have to travel through the forests.
The jungle K&#257;nikars have no permanent abode, but shift about
from one part of the forest to another. Their settlements, composed of
lowly huts built of bamboo and reeds, are abandoned when they suffer
from fever, or are harassed by wild beasts, or when the soil ceases to
be productive. The settlements are generally situated, away from the
tracks of elephants, on steep hill slopes, which are terraced and
planted with useful trees. In their system of cultivation the
K&#257;nikars first clear a patch of forest, and then set fire to it.
The ground is sown with hardly any previous tillage. When, after two or
three years, the land diminishes in productiveness, they move onto
another part of the forest, and follow the same rough and ready method
of cultivation. Thus one patch of ground after another is used for
agricultural purposes, until a whole tract of forest is cleared. But
the K&#257;nikars have now to a large extent abandoned this kind of
migratory cultivation, because, according to the forest rules, forests
may not be set fire to or trees felled at the unrestricted pleasure of
individuals. They cultivate various kinds of cereals and pulses, as
well as tapioca [<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164](Manihot utilissima), sweet potatoes
(Ipom&oelig;a batatas), ganja (Indian hemp), and tobacco. Each
settlement now has a forest block assigned to it for cultivation, with
which other tribes are not allowed to interfere, and wherein the
K&#257;nikars are allowed to fell, clear, and grow their crops. They do
not pay anything in the way of tax to the Government. Once a year they
go in a group to visit the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja at Trivandrum, and he
&ldquo;always receives them most kindly, accepting the nuzzur they
offer in the shape of the bamboo plantain with large though few fruits,
a parcel of Muttucheri hill rice, bamboo joints containing different
varieties of honey, and virukachattam or a parcel of civet. The
customary modes of court address, and the prescribed court etiquette
are alike unknown to them, and the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, pleased with
their simplicity and unaffected homage, rewards them with presents of
cloth, money, salt, and tobacco, with which they return satisfied to
their jungle home.&rdquo; The Rev. S. Mateer notes that he had
difficulty in persuading the K&#257;nikars to part with a sucker of the
bamboo plantain, as they fancied it must be reserved for the use of the
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja alone.
Some K&#257;nikars are engaged as coolies on planters&rsquo;
estates, or in felling timber and cutting bamboos for contractors,
others in the manufacture of bows and arrows with blunt or barbed iron
heads. Heated arrows are used by them, for hitting elephants which
invade their sugar-cane or other crop, from the safe protection of a
hut built on a platform of sticks in tall trees of branches or bamboo
covered with leaves of Ochlandra Travancorica or other large
leaves. In connection with these huts, which are called &#257;namadam
(elephant huts), it has been said that &ldquo;the hills abound with
game. &lsquo;Bison&rsquo; (Bos gaurus), bears, and s&#257;mbar
(Cervus unicolor) [<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165]are frequently met with, while
elephants and tigers are so numerous that the K&#257;nikars are in some
parts compelled to build their houses high up in trees. These primitive
houses are quickly and easily constructed. The walls are made of
bamboo, and the roof is thatched with jungle leaves. They are generally
built about fifty feet above the ground, and are securely fastened to
the branches of a substantial tree, and a crude ladder of bamboo
connects them with the ground. When all the inmates are safely housed
for the night, the ladder is removed aloft out of the reach of
elephants, who, mischievously inclined, might remove the obstruction,
and leave the K&#257;nikars to regain terra firma the best way they
could.&rdquo; Sometimes a single bamboo, with the shoots on the sides
cut short, does duty for a ladder. It has been said that, when the
crops are ripening, the K&#257;nikar watchmen are always at home in
their arboreal houses, with their bows and arrows, and chanting their
wild songs. Sometimes the blunt end of an arrow is used as a twirling
stick in making fire by friction, for which purpose sticks made of
Grewia tili&oelig;folia, etc., are also used. In making fire,
the K&#257;nikars &ldquo;procure two pieces of wood, one of which is
soft, and contains a small hole or hollow about half an inch deep to
receive the end of the other, which is a hard round stick about
eighteen inches long, and as thick as an ordinary ruler. The
K&#257;nikar takes this stick between the palms of his hands, keeping
it in a vertical position, with the end of it in the hollow referred
to, and produces a quick rotary and reverse motion, and with slight
pressure causes the friction necessary to produce a quantity of fluff,
which soon ignites.&rdquo;
The K&#257;nikars are employed by the Government to collect honey,
wax, ginger, cardamoms, dammar, and [<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166]elephant tusks, in
return for a small remuneration known as kutiv&#257;ram. Other
occupations are trapping, capturing or killing elephants, tigers, and
wild pigs, and making wicker-work articles of bamboo or rattan. The
Rev. S. Mateer mentions having seen a wicker bridge, perhaps a hundred
feet long, over which a pony could pass. A tiger trap is said to be a
huge affair made of strong wooden bars, with a partition at one end for
a live goat as bait. The timbers thereof are supported by a spring,
which, on a wild beast entering, lets fall a crushing weight on it.
The K&#257;nikars wander all over the hills in search of honey, and
a resident in Travancore writes that &ldquo;I have seen a high rugged
rock, only accessible on one side, the other side being a sheer
precipice of several hundred feet, and in its deep crevices scores of
bees&rsquo; nests. Some of them have been there for generations, and
the K&#257;nikars perform periodically most daring feats in
endeavouring to secure at least a portion of the honey. On this
precipice I have seen overhanging and fluttering in the breeze a rattan
rope, made in rings and strongly linked together, the whole forming a
rope ladder several hundred feet long, and securely fastened to a tree
at the top of the precipice. Only a short time ago these people made
one of their usual raids on the &lsquo;honey rock.&rsquo; One of the
tribe descended the rope ladder for a considerable distance, with a
basket fastened to his back to receive the honey, and carrying with him
torch-wood with which to smoke the bees out of the nests. Having
arrived at his goal two hundred feet from the top, and over three
hundred feet from the ground below, he ignited the torch, and, after
the usual smoking process, which took some little time to perform, the
bees made a hurried exit from the nests, and the K&#257;nikar began the
[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167]work of destruction, and with every movement the
man and the ladder swayed to and fro, as if the whole thing would
collapse at any moment. However, all was safe, and, after securing as
much honey as he could conveniently carry, he began the return journey.
Hand and foot he went up ring after ring until he reached the top in
safety, performing the ascent with an air of nonchalant ease, which
would have done credit to any steeple jack.&rdquo; The honey is brought
for sale in hollow bamboo joints.
Sometimes K&#257;nikars come into Trivandrum, bringing with them
live animals for the zoological gardens.
The word K&#257;nikaran means a hereditary proprietor of land. There
is a tradition that there were once two hill kings, Sr&#299; Rangan and
V&#299;rappan, whose descendants emigrated from the P&#257;ndyan
territories beyond Agastyak&#363;tam under pressure from a superior
force, and never returned to the low country. The following legend is
current among the K&#257;nikars. &ldquo;The sea originally covered
everything, but God caused the water to roll back, and leave bare all
the hills. Then Param&#275;swara and Parvati made a man and woman,
whose descendants were divided into fifty-six races, and multiplied
exceedingly, so that a sore famine invaded the land. In those days men
were hunters, and lived by snaring animals and plucking wild fruits off
the trees. There was no corn, for men did not know how to sow rice, and
cultivate it. The cry of the famine-stricken reached Param&#275;swara
and Parvati, and they visited the earth in the form of a pair of hamsam
(the bird which carries Brahma), and alighted on a kanjiram tree. While
seated there, the god and goddess noticed a pair of dragon-flies, which
paired together, and they too, their hearts swelling with love,
embraced each other, and, taking pity on mankind, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168]willed that a field of rice should sprout on the
low-lying land near the sea-shore. The Paraiyans and Pulayans, who
witnessed the rice growing, were the first to taste of the crop, and
became prosperous. This was in Malabar, or the far north of Travancore.
The Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, hearing of the new grain, sent seven green
parrots to go On a journey of discovery, and they returned with seven
ears of rice. These the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja placed in a granary, and
gave some to the Paraiyans to sow, and the grain miraculously
increased. But the Mah&#257;r&#257;ja wanted to know how it was to be
cooked. The parrots were accordingly once more brought into
requisition, and they flew away, and brought back eighteen varieties of
cooked rice which a Paraiyan&rsquo;s wife had prepared. Then the
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja, having got some rice prepared by his cooks, fell to
and eat heartily. After eating, he went into the yard to wash his
hands, and, before drying them on a cloth, wrung his right hand to get
the last drops of water off. A valuable gold ring with three stones
fell therefrom, and, burying itself in the dust, was never recovered.
The Mah&#257;r&#257;ja was sore distressed by his loss, but,
Param&#275;swara, as some recompense, caused to grow from the ground
where the ring fell three trees which are very valuable in Travancore,
and which, by the sale of their produce, would make the
Mah&#257;r&#257;ja wealthy and prosperous. The trees were the dammar
tree, the resinous gum of which is useful in religious ceremonies, the
sandal-wood tree so widely used for its perfume, and lastly the bamboo,
which is so useful and necessary to the well-being of the
K&#257;nikars.&rdquo;

K&#257;nikars Making Fire.

The sub-divisions among the K&#257;nikars are known as illams or
families, of which five are said to be endogamous, and five exogamous.
The former are called Machchampi or brother-in-law illams, and the
latter [<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169]Annantampi or brother illams. They are named
after mountains (e.g., P&#257;lamala, Talamala), places
(e.g., Vellan&#257;t), etc. The K&#257;nikars who live south of
the Kodayar river cannot marry those living north of it, the river
forming a marital boundary.
Among the names of K&#257;nikars are Parapan (broad-faced),
Chanthiran (moon), Marthandan (sun), Muntan (dwarf), K&#257;liyan
(little Kali), M&#257;dan (a deity), N&#299;li (blue) and Karumpi
(black). The first name is sometimes that of the settlement in which
they live. For example, the various Mullans are known as Kuzhumbi
Mullan, &#256;naimalai Mullan, Chembilakayam Mullan, etc.
The K&#257;nikars live together in small communities under a
M&#363;ttak&#257;ni or headman, who wields considerable influence over
them, and enjoys various perquisites. He presides over tribal council
meetings, at which all social questions are discussed and settled, and
fixes the time for clearing the jungle, sowing the seed, gathering the
harvest, worshipping the gods, etc. Fines which are inflicted are spent
in propitiating the gods.
The language of the K&#257;nikars is a dialect of Malay&#257;lam,
with a large admixture of Tamil, which they call Malamp&#257;shai or
language of the hills.
The system of inheritance among those who live in the hills is
makkath&#257;yam (from father to son). But a moiety of the personal
property goes to the nephews. With those who live in the plains, an
equal distribution of their self-acquired property is made between the
sons and nephews. If there are no sons, the nephews inherit the
property, the widow being entitled to maintenance.
The chief object of worship is said to be S&#257;sthan, a forest
god. But the K&#257;nikars also make offerings to a variety of deities,
including Amman, Poothathan, Vetik&#257;d Pootham, Vadamala Poothathan,
and Amcala. [<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170]They have, it has been said, &ldquo;certain
spots, trees or rocks, where their relations or friends have met with
some unusual good luck or calamity, where they generally offer their
prayers. Here they periodically assemble, and pray that the catastrophe
that had befallen a comrade may not fall on them, or that the blessings
which another had received may be showered on them.&rdquo; Generally in
February a festival called kodai is held, whereat the K&#257;nikars
assemble. Goats and fowls are sacrificed, and the p&#363;j&#257;ri
(priest) offers boiled rice and meat to the sylvan deities in a
consecrated place. The festival, to which many come from the low
country, winds up with drinking and dancing. The K&#257;nikar musical
instruments include a reed flute or clarionet, and men dance to the
music, while the women clap their hands in time with it. The
K&#257;nikars worship their gods twice a year, in the months of
M&#299;nam and Kanni. On the morning of the celebration, every family
takes rice and plantains to the dwelling of the headman. With the
exception of a small quantity which is set aside, the rice is husked
and ground to flour by boys or men, after bathing and washing their
hands and feet. The rice is taken to a clearing in the fields, whither
a K&#257;nikar who knows how to invoke the deity comes after bathing.
He lays out a row of plantain leaves, and spreads on each leaf a little
rice, on which plantains are laid. These are covered over with a
plantain leaf, on which rice is sprinkled. The officiating K&#257;nikar
then burns incense, carries it round the trophy, and places it in front
thereof. All do obeisance by raising their hands to their foreheads,
and pray for a fruitful harvest. Sometimes the officiating K&#257;nikar
becomes inspired like a Velichap&#257;d, and gives expression to
oracular utterances. At the close of the ceremony, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171]distribution of the rice and plantains takes
place. When the land is to be cleared for cultivation, the headman is
invited to attend, and some rice and cocoanuts are presented to him,
which he offers up, and clears a small portion with his own hand. On
the first appearance of the ears of grain, the K&#257;nikars spend two
nights in drumming, singing, and repeating mantrams at the field, and
put up a tattu or platform on four sticks as a shrine for the spirits,
to whom they offer raw rice, tender cocoanuts, flowers, etc. At harvest
time rice, plantains, sweetmeats, and flowers are offered to the
various hill demons, P&#363;rcha Mallan Pey, the cat giant, Athirakodi
Pey, the boundary flag demon, and others.
For the following note on a K&#257;nikar harvest festival I am
indebted to an article by Mr. A. P. Smith.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2332src" href="#xd21e2332" name="xd21e2332src">90 It was
performed in propitiation of the Barad&#275;vata, or household gods of
a house in the neighbourhood, the presiding deity being M&#257;dan. The
ceremony is commonly called the feeding ceremony, and should be carried
out just before the harvesting of the grain commences. &ldquo;The
officiating K&#257;ni is generally an elderly and influential man, who
professes inspiration and knowledge obtained when asleep. The articles
necessary to perform the ceremony are called Paduka or sacrifice, and
Ashtamangalyam. Paduka is for the adult gods or manes, male or female,
called Chava, and Ashtamangalyam is for the virgins who have died,
called Kanyakas. A temporary pavilion or pandal had been erected in
front of the house, and from the canopy long streamers of tender
cocoanut leaves, bunches of plantains, and tender cocoanuts, with their
husk on, were hung. Branches of areca nuts and flowers adorned the
posts [<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172]and pillars. Small heaps, consisting of boiled
rice, paddy, a tender cocoanut, a sprig of areca flowers, and betel
were placed on plantain leaves in seven definite spots. The officiating
K&#257;nikar, after formally getting the permission of the assembled
spectators, and especially of one who subsequently appeared on the
scene as the chief dancer, began a monotonous chant in what appeared to
be a mixed language. It was understood to be a history of the beginning
of earthly kings, a record of the life and doings of departed souls,
whose protection was prayed for, and a prayer for the souls of those
persons for whose benefit the ceremony of propitiation was in progress.
Now and again the feelings of the narrator or singer would overcome
him, and he would indulge in a shout or in emphatic gesticulations.
This went on for about three or four hours, punctuated at intervals by
the firing of petards or old smooth-bore guns, and the shrill cries of
the women. Before the chanting terminated, a large heap of the red
flowers of Ixora coccinea (thetti pu), about a
yard square at the base, had been raised in the centre of the pandal,
and it was prettily picked out with areca flowers in artistic designs.
The horrible sound of a human voice roaring like a wild beast aroused
every one to a sense of activity. From behind the hut came the man
already mentioned, very primitively clothed, his hair hanging loose,
his eyes staring, and what appeared like foam at his mouth. He would
stand, run short distances, leap, sit, agitate his body, and dance,
keeping step to the rhythmic and muffled beating of the drum. This he
did for ten minutes or so. Suddenly, with a shout, he dived into the
hut specially set apart as the feeding place of the god M&#257;dan, and
presently appeared with two long sticks adorned at their ends with
bells, [<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173]which emitted a jingling sound. The frenzy of
motion, ecstatic, unregulated and ungovernable, was apparently
infectious, for a young man, hitherto a silent spectator of the scene,
gave a shout, and began to dance wildly, throwing up his arms, and
stepping out quite actively. This encouragement stimulated the original
performer, and he caught a man standing near by the neck, thrust the
stick with the bells into his hand, and he thereupon started dancing as
well. In about ten minutes there were some half a dozen wild dancing
dervishes, shouting, gesticulating, revolving, and most certainly in an
abnormal state of excitement. A dying but still glowing heap of fire
and ashes became the centre of attraction, for the chief dancer danced
over the fire, and sent the sparks flying, and scattered the wood, and
evoked the admiration and eulogies of the crowd. Streaming with
perspiration, spotted with ashes, wild, dishevelled and exhausted, the
chief dancing demoniac stepped under the pandal, and finally sat
himself before the heap of red flowers, and tossed the blossoms over
his head in a kind of shower bath. He was assisted in this by the old
K&#257;nikar and other bystanders. A little boy was brought before him,
and he called the lad by a name. This was his christening ceremony, for
the lad assumed the name from that time. The chief dancer then stood
up, and appeared to be still in a possessed state. A fine old rooster
was brought, and its throat cut. It was then handed to the dancer, who
applied his lips to the gaping wound, and drained the blood, swallowing
the fluid audibly. Before relinquishing his hold of the bird, he swayed
and fell on the ground in what seemed to be a swoon. This indicated
that the sacrifice had been acceptable, that the propitiation was
perfected, and that all the wishes of the persons interested in them
would [<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174]be granted. The crowd then set to eating and
drinking the sacrificial elements, and dispersed.&rdquo;
Both adult and infant marriage are practiced. Those who had married
&lsquo;infants,&rsquo; on being questioned, stated that this is the
safest course, as grown-up brides sometimes run away to their
parents&rsquo; house, whereas younger girls get accustomed to their
husbands&rsquo; home. On a fixed day, within a month of the marriage
ceremony, four K&#257;nikars, accompanied by a boy carrying betel
leaves and areca nuts, go to the home of the future bride, and present
them to the families of the settlement. On the wedding morning, all
assemble at a pandal (booth), and the bridegroom distributes
p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri (betel leaf and areca nuts). His sister then
brings forward the bride, and the bridegroom presents her with a cloth,
which she puts on. Bride, bridegroom, and a young boy, then stand on a
mat beneath the pandal, and the bridegroom ties the minnu (marriage
badge) round the neck of the bride if she is an infant. If she is an
adult, he places the minnu in front of her neck, on which it is tied by
his sister. A plantain leaf is then placed in front of the bridal
couple, and curry and rice served thereon by their mothers. The two
women then take hold of the bride&rsquo;s head, and press it seven
times towards her husband&rsquo;s shoulders. This ceremony concluded,
the young boy takes a small quantity of the curry and rice, and puts it
in the mouth of the bridegroom seven times. The bridegroom&rsquo;s
younger brother then gives a morsel to the bride. The ceremonial
terminates with a feast. The dowry includes billhooks, brass vessels,
choppers, grain, and pulses. The headman, according to Mateer, offers
some advice to the husband concerning the management of his wife. The
heads of his discourse are arranged under the following
heads:&mdash;teaching by [<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175]words, pinching, and blows, and
casting the woman away at last, if she is not obedient. In the
remarriage of widows, the bridegroom simply gives the woman a pair of
cloths, and, with the consent of the male members of her family, takes
her to his home.
During the seventh month of pregnancy, a woman has to perform a
ceremony called vaguthu pongal. Seven pots are placed on seven hearths,
and, when the rice placed therein has boiled, the woman salutes it, and
all present partake thereof. According to Mateer &ldquo;the ceremony
practised on the occasion of pregnancy is called vayaru pongal, when
boiled rice is offered to the sun. First they mould an image of
Gan&#275;sha, and, setting it in a suitable place, boil the rice. To
this they add for an offering aval or flattened rice, parched rice,
cakes, plantain fruits, young cocoanuts, and tender leaves of the same
palm, with the flowers of the areca palm. The headman then commences
dancing, and repeating mantrams. He waves the offerings to the sun. On
first giving rice to a child, a feast is held, and an offering
presented to the jungle demons.&rdquo;
Concerning the death ceremonies, Mateer writes that &ldquo;when any
one is taken ill, the headman is at once consulted. He visits the sick
person, and orders two drumming and singing ceremonies to be performed.
A whole night is spent in dancing, singing, drumming, and prayers for
the recovery of the patient. The offerings consist of tapioca, flour
and cocoanuts, and other articles. After some time the headman, with
manifestations of demoniac possession, reveals whether the sufferer
will die or not. If the former, he repeats a mantram (kudumi vettu
mantram, or formula on cutting off the top-knot), and cuts off the sick
man&rsquo;s kudumi. This being a sign of approaching death, the
relatives and others pay their [<a id="pb176"
href="#pb176" name="pb176">176]last visits to the sick.
After death, a mixture of ganja (Indian hemp), raw rice, and cocoanut,
is put into the mouth of the corpse by the son and nephews, and it is
buried at some distance from their abode, mantrams being repeated over
it. Occasionally the corpse is cremated. The relatives bathe before
returning home, and cannot take any of the produce of their lands till
the death pollution is removed, fearing that wild beasts will attack
them or destroy their crops. To this end a small shed is built outside
their clearing on the third day. Three measures of rice are boiled, and
placed in a cup or on a plantain leaf inside the shed. Then all bathe,
and return home. On the seventh day all this is repeated, the old shed
being pulled down, and a new one put up. On returning to their
dwelling, they sprinkle cow-dung on their houses and in the yard, which
finally removes the defilement. People in better circumstances make a
feast of curry and rice for all present.&rdquo; The cow-dung is
sprinkled with leafy twigs of the mango or j&#257;k tree, or flower
stalks of the areca palm. The ashes, after cremation, are said to be
collected in a pot or leaf, and thrown into the nearest stream or
river. An annual ceremony, in commemoration of ancestors, is held, at
which rice is boiled and offered up.
The K&#257;nikars, like the Irulas and Y&#257;n&#257;dis of the
Tamil and Telugu countries, do not belong to the polluting classes.
Pulayans, Kuruvans, and V&#275;dans are not allowed to approach
them.
The dietary of the jungle K&#257;nikars includes wild pigs, deer,
porcupines, hares, monkeys, fowls, sheep and goats, parakeets, doves,
tortoises, fish, crabs, peacocks, tigers (said to taste like black
monkey), owls, squirrels and field rats, in addition to many vegetable
products of the forest. They will not eat beef or the flesh of
&lsquo;bison.&rsquo; [<a id="pb177" href="#pb177"
name="pb177">177]
Some K&#257;nikars are tattooed on the forehead with a crescent and
dot, or a vertical stripe. The K&#257;nikars say that their ancestors
wore a garment made of jungle fibre, which has been replaced by a
cotton loin-cloth. &ldquo;Both men and women,&rdquo; Mr. M. Ratnaswami
Aiyar writes, &ldquo;wear on the neck numerous strings of red beads and
rings made of shells, which hang down to the abdomen in the case of the
women. The men wear ear-rings of brass or silver. The women wear
bangles of brass and iron, and a number of brass rings on the fingers.
The men bear suspended from one of their shoulders a cloth bag
containing two or more partitions, in which they keep their
vilangupetti or box containing betel, tobacco, and chunam. They carry,
too, suspended from the shoulder, a cane basket wherein they place
their day&rsquo;s crop of grain or roots, or any other food obtained by
them. They attach to their waist-string or cloth a billhook and knife,
and carry their bows and arrows slung on their shoulders. Whenever the
K&#257;nikars from the different k&#257;nis or settlements have to be
gathered together for a common meeting, or for going together elsewhere
on a common purpose, a messenger amongst them carries from one
k&#257;ni to another the message with a knot of fibres of creepers,
which serves as a symbol of call. The knotted fibre is passed on from
one k&#257;ni to another till the required assembly is secured. It is
thus that I secured my K&#257;nikars to present them to their
Excellencies Lord and Lady Curzon.&rdquo;

Malabar, is a Malay&#257;lam corruption of the Sanskrit Ganika, meaning
an astrologer. The word was originally Kani, in which form it
invariably appears in Malay&#257;lam works and Tamil documents. The
honorific suffix &lsquo;&#257;n&rsquo; has been added subsequently.
The two titles, generally applied to Kaniyans, are Panikkar and
&#256;san. The former is said to be a common title in Malabar, but in
Travancore it seems to be restricted to the north. The word Panikkar
comes from pani, or work, viz., that of military training. The fact
that most of the families, who own this title at present, were once
teachers of bodily exercises, is evident not only from the name kalari,
literally a military school, by which their houses are usually known,
but also from the K&#275;ralolpatti, which assigns military training as
a duty of the caste. &#256;san, a corruption of the Sanskrit
&#256;ch&#257;rya, is a common title among Kaniyans in South
Travancore. Special titles, such as Anantapadman&#257;bham,
Sivasankaran, and Sankili, are said to be possessed by certain families
in the south, having been conferred on them by kings in olden times.
Some Kaniyans in the north enjoy the surname of Nampikuruppu.
Kaniyans are divided into two endogamous sections, viz., Kaniyar and
T&#299;nta (or polluting). The occupations of the latter are
umbrella-making and spirit-exorcising, while the others remain
astrologers, pure and simple. A few families, living at Alengad, are
called Vattakan Kaniyans, and are believed to have come there on the
[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179]eve of T&#299;p&#363; Sultan&rsquo;s invasion.
The women of the Kaniyans proper do not eat with them. According to
tradition, eight sub-septs are said to have existed among the Kaniyans,
four of which were known as kiriyams, and four as illams. The names of
the former are Annavikkannam, Karivattam, Kutappilla, and Nanna; of the
latter Pampara, Tachchazham, Netumkanam, and Ayyark&#257;la. These
divisions were once endogamous, but this distinction has now
disappeared.
In a note on the Kaniyans of the Cochin State,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2394src" href="#xd21e2394" name="xd21e2394src">92 Mr. L. K.
Anantha Krishna Iyer writes that &ldquo;there is some difference in the
social status between the Kaniyans of the southern, and the Kalari
Panikkans of the northern parts of the State. The latter profess a kind
of superiority in status, on the ground that the former have no
kalaris. It is also said by the latter that the occupation of the
former was once that of umbrella-making, and that astrology as a
profession has been recently adopted by them. There is at present
neither intermarriage, nor interdining between them. The Kaniyans
pollute the Kalari Panikkans by touch.&rdquo; In connection with the
old village organisation in Malabar, Cochin, and Travancore, Mr.
Anantha Krishna Iyer writes further that &ldquo;every tara or kara
(village) consisted of all castemen below Br&#257;hmans, especially the
N&#257;yars of all classes, more or less living in a community, the
Kamm&#257;lans, Izhuvans, P&#257;n&#257;ns, Mannans, and other castemen
living further apart. For every such village in the northern part of
the State, there was also a Kalari Panikkan, with a kalari (gymnastic
or military school), where the young men of the village, chiefly the
N&#257;yars, were trained in all kinds of athletic feats, and in arms.
The institution of the kalaris has [<a id="pb180"
href="#pb180" name="pb180">180]now disappeared, though the
building remains in some places, and the Panikkans are now mainly
astrologers and village schoolmasters. According to their own
statement, Parasur&#257;ma, the great coloniser of K&#275;rala,
established kalaris throughout the kingdom, and appointed them as the
masters to train S&#363;dra young men in all kinds of feats (one
thousand and eight in number), for the protection of the country
against foreign invaders. The N&#257;yars, who then formed the fighting
race, were mostly trained by the Panikkans. In memory of this, the
Kalari Panikkans of the northern portions of the State, and of South
Malabar, profess even now a preceptorship to the N&#257;yars, and the
Nayars show them some respect, being present at their marriages and
other ceremonies. The Pannikkans say that the N&#257;yars obtained
their kalaris from them. There are still a few among the Panikkans,
here and there, fit to teach young men various feats. The following are
the names of some of them:&mdash;
(1) Pitichu Kali. Two persons play on their drums (chenda), while a
third person, well dressed in a kacha, and with a turban on his head,
and provided with a sword and shield, performs various feats in harmony
with the drum beating. It is a kind of sword-dance.
(2) Parishathalam Kali. A large pandal (booth) is erected in front
of the house where the performance is to take place, and the boys below
sixteen, who have been previously trained for it, are brought there.
The performance takes place at night. The chenda, maddhalam, chengala,
and elathalam (circular bell-metal plates slightly concave in the
middle) are the instruments used in the performance. After the
performance, the boys, whom the &#256;san has trained, present
themselves before him, and remunerate him with whatever they can
afford. [<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181]Parties are organised to give this performance
on all auspicious occasions in rural districts.
(3) Kolati. Around a lighted lamp, a number of persons stand in a
circle, each with a stick a foot in length, and as thick as a thumb, in
each hand. They begin to sing, first in slow time, and gradually in
rapid measure. The time is marked by each one hitting his
neighbours&rsquo; sticks with his own on both sides. Much dexterity and
precision are required, as also experience in combined action and
movements, lest the amateur should be hit by his neighbours as the
measure is accelerated. The songs are invariably in praise of God or
man.
The Kaniyans, according to one tradition, are Br&#257;hman
astrologers, who gradually lost their position, as their predictions
became less and less accurate. Concerning their legendary history, Mr.
Anantha Krishna Iyer writes as follows. &ldquo;Once, says one of these
legends, when the god Subrahmanya, son of Siva, and his friend were
learning astrology, they knew that the sound of a lizard close by
foreboded some evil to the mother of the former. The friend practiced
some magical rite, which averted the evil. His mother, who had been in
a state of unconsciousness, suddenly woke up as if from slumber, and
asked the son &lsquo;Kany-ar,&rsquo; i.e., who it was that she
looked at. To which the son replied that she was looking at a Kaniyan
(astrologer). The Kaniyans still believe that the umbrella, the stick,
the holy ashes, and the purse of cowries, which form the paraphernalia
of a Kaniyan nowadays, were given by Subramanya. The following is
another tradition regarding the origin of the caste. In ancient times,
it is said, P&#257;n&#257;ns, V&#275;lans, and Kaniyans were practicing
magic, but astrology as a profession was practiced exclusively by the
Br&#257;hmans. [<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182]There lived a famous astrologer, Thalakkaleth
Bhattathiripad, who was the most renowned of the astrologers of the
time. He had a son whose horoscope he cast, and from it he concluded
that his son would live long. Unfortunately he proved to be mistaken,
for his son died. Unable to find out the error in his calculation and
prediction, he took the horoscope to an equally famous astrologer of
the Ch&#333;la kingdom, who, aware of the cause of his advent, directed
him to adore some deity that might aid him in the working out of his
predictions. Accordingly he came to the Trich&#363;r temple, where, as
directed, he spent some days in devotion to the deity. Thereafter he
worked wonders in astrology, and became so well known in Malabar,
Cochin, and Travancore, that he commanded the respect and admiration of
the rulers, who invited him to cast horoscopes, and make predictions.
For so doing he was liberally rewarded. One day a Br&#257;hman, hearing
that his guru at Benares was seriously ill, consulted the
Bhattathiripad whether and how he would be able to see him before his
death. The Br&#257;hman astrologer directed him to go to the southern
side of the Trich&#363;r temple, where he would see two persons coming
towards him, who might gratify his desire to see his preceptor. These
persons were really the servants of Yama (the god of death). They asked
him to touch them, and he at once found himself at the side of his
teacher. The Br&#257;hman was asked who had directed him to them, and,
when he told them that it was the renowned Br&#257;hman astrologer,
they cursed him, saying that he would become an outcaste. This fate
came as no surprise to the astrologer, for he had already perceived
from an evil conjunction of the planets that disgrace and danger were
impending. To try to avoid the sad fate which he foresaw, he left
[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183]his home and friends, and set out on a boating
excursion in a river close by Pazh&#363;r. The night was dark, and it
was midnight when he reached the middle of the stream. A severe storm,
accompanied by rain, had come on, and the river was in flood. He was
swept away to an unknown region, and scrambled ashore in torrents of
rain and in darkness, when he saw a light in a house near where he
landed, and he made for it in an exhausted condition. On reaching it,
he lay down in the verandah at the gate of the house, musing on the
untoward events of the night, and on his affectionate family whom he
had left. The hut belonged to the family of a Kaniyan,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2418src" href="#xd21e2418" name=
"xd21e2418src">93 who, as it happened, had had a quarrel with his
wife that day, and had left his hut. Anxiously expecting her
husband&rsquo;s return, the wife opened the door about midnight, and,
seeing a man lying in the verandah, mistook him for her husband. The
man was so wrapt in his thoughts of his home that he in turn mistook
her for his wife. When the Br&#257;hman woke up from his slumber, he
found her to be a Kaniya woman. On looking at the star in the heavens
to calculate the precise time, he saw that the prediction that he would
become an outcaste had been fulfilled. He accepted the degradation, and
lived the rest of his days with the Kaniya woman. She bore him several
sons, whom in due course he educated in the lore of his profession, and
for whom, by his influence, he obtained an important place in the Hindu
social system as astrologers (Ganikans). It is said that, according to
his instruction, his body, after his death, was placed in a coffin, and
buried in the courtyard of the house. The spot is still shown, and an
elevated platform is constructed, [<a id="pb184"
href="#pb184" name="pb184">184]with a thatched roof over it.
A lighted lamp is placed at all times on the platform, and in front of
it astrological calculations and predictions are made, for it is
believed that those who made such calculations there will have the aid
of the spirit of their dead Br&#257;hman ancestor, who was so learned
in the science that he could tell of events long past, and predict even
future birth. As an instance of the last, the following incident may be
given. Once the great Br&#257;hman ascetic Vilwamangalath Sw&#257;miyar
was suffering severely from pains in the stomach, when he prayed to the
divine Krishna for relief. Finding no remedy, he turned to a
Br&#257;hman friend, a Y&#333;gi, who gave him some holy ashes, which
he took, and which relieved him of the pains. He mentioned the fact to
his beloved god Krishna, who, by the pious adoration of the ascetic,
appeared before him, when he said that he would have three births in
the world instead of one which was destined for him. With an eager
desire to know what they would be, he consulted the Bhattathiripad, who
said that he would be born first as a rat-snake (Zamenis
mucosus), then as an ox, and thirdly as a tulsi plant (Ocimum
sanctum), and that he would be along with him in these births. With
great pleasure he returned home. It is also said that the astrologer
himself was born as an ox, and was in this form afterwards supported by
the members of his family. The incident is said to have taken place at
Pazh&#363;r, eighteen miles east of Ernakulam. The members of the
family are called Pazh&#363;r Kaniyans, and are well known throughout
Malabar, Cochin and Travancore, for their predictions in astrology, and
all classes of people even now resort to them for aid in predictions.
The Kalari Panikkans in the northern parts of the Cochin State have a
different account of the origin of the caste. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185]Once, they say, a sage and astrologer, named a
Ganikan, was making prediction to a S&#363;dra regarding his future
destiny. As this was done by him when in an uncleanly state, he was
cursed by the Saptharishis (seven sages). The Panikkans who are reputed
to be his descendants are ordained to be teachers and astrologers of
all castes below Br&#257;hmans.&rdquo;
According to another legendary account, there were Kaniyans before
the time of Bhattatiri, but their astrological attainments are
connected with him. Talakulattu Bhattatiri was one of the earliest
astrologers of renown, being the author of Muh&#363;rtapadavi, and
lived in the fourth century A.D. There is a tradition, believed by the
Kaniyans south of Neyyattenkara, that their ancestor was descended from
the union of a Gandharva woman with Kani, a Br&#257;hman saint, who
lived in the western gh&#257;ts. Their grandson propitiated the god
Subrahmanya presiding over astronomy, and acquired the surname
N&#257;l&#299;ka from his never-ceasing truthfulness. Some of the
southern Kaniyans even at the present day call themselves N&#257;li.
According to another legend, Param&#275;swara and his wife Parvati were
living happily together, when Agni fell desperately in love with the
latter. Eventually, Param&#275;swara caught them together, and, to save
Agni, Parvati suggested that he should hide himself inside her body. On
Agni doing this, Parvati became very indisposed, and Param&#275;swara,
distressed at seeing his wife rolling in agony, shed tears, one of
which fell on the ground, and became turned into a man, who, being
divinely born, detected the cause of Parvati&rsquo;s indisposition,
and, asking for some incense, sprinkled it over a blazing torch. Agni,
seeing his opportunity, escaped in the smoke, and Parvati had instant
relief. For this service, [<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186]Param&#275;swara blessed the man,
and appointed him and his descendants to cure diseases, exorcise
demons, and foretell events.
The Kaniyans of Malabar have been connected by tradition with the
Valluvans of the Tamil country, who are the priests, doctors, and
astrologers of the Pallans and Paraiyans. According to this tradition,
the modern Kaniyans are traced to the Valluvans brought from the east
by a Perum&#257;l who ruled over Kerala in 350 M.E. The latter are
believed to have become Kaniyans proper, while the old Kaniyans of the
west coast descended to the rank of T&#299;nt&#257; Kaniyans. The chief
of the Valluvans so brought was a Y&#333;gi or ascetic, who, being
asked by a Namb&#363;tiri concerning a missing article at Pazh&#363;r,
replied correctly that the lost ring had been placed in a hole in the
bank of the Namb&#363;tiri&rsquo;s tank (pond), and was consequently
invited to settle there permanently.
The Kaniyans are easily recognised by their punctilious cleanness of
person and clothing, the iron style and knife tucked into the waist,
the palm umbrella with its ribs holding numbers of horoscopes, their
low artistic bow, and their deliberate answers to questions put to
them. Most of them are intelligent, and well versed in Malay&#257;lam
and Sanskrit. They are, however, not a flourishing community, being
averse to manual labour, and depending for their living on their
hereditary profession. There are no more conservative people in
Travancore, and none of them have taken kindly to western education. In
their clothing they follow the orthodox Malabar fashion. The dress of
the males seldom hangs loose, being tucked in in token of humility. The
Kaniyan, when wanted in his professional capacity, presents himself
with triple ash marks of Siva on his chest, arms, and forehead. The
woman&rsquo;s ornaments [<a id="pb187" href=
"#pb187" name="pb187">187]resemble those of the Izhuvans.
Fish and flesh are not forbidden as food, but there are many families,
as those of Pazh&#363;r and Onakk&#363;ru, which strictly abstain from
meat. Marriage between families which eat and abstain from flesh is not
absolutely forbidden. But a wife must give up eating flesh immediately
on entering the house of her vegetarian husband. The profession of the
Kaniyans is astrology. Marco Polo, writing as early as the thirteenth
century about Travancore, says that it was even then pre-eminently the
land of astrologers. Barbosa, at the beginning of the sixteenth
century, has a detailed reference to the Kaniyans, of whom he writes
that &ldquo;they learn letters and astronomy, and some of them are
great astrologers, and foretell many future things, and form judgments
upon the births of men. Kings and great persons send to call them, and
come out of their palaces to gardens and pleasure-grounds to see them,
and ask them what they desire to know; and these people form judgment
upon these things in a few days, and return to those that asked of
them, but they may not enter the palaces; nor may they approach the
king&rsquo;s person on account of being low people. And the king is
then alone with him. They are great diviners, and pay great attention
to times and places of good and bad luck, which they cause to be
observed by those kings and great men, and by the merchants also; and
they take care to do their business at the time which these astrologers
advise them, and they do the same in their voyages and marriages. And
by these means these men gain a great deal.&rdquo; Buchanan, three
centuries later, alludes in the same glowing terms to the prosperity of
the Kaniyans. He notes that they are of very low caste, a
Namb&#363;tiri coming within twenty-four feet of one being obliged to
purify himself by prayer and ablution. &ldquo;The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188]Kaniyans,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;possess
almanacks, by which they inform people as to the proper time for
performing ceremonies or sowing their seeds, and the hours which are
fortunate or unfortunate for any undertaking. When persons are sick or
in trouble, the Cunishun, by performing certain ceremonies in a magical
square of 12 places, discovers what spirit is the cause of the evil,
and also how it may be appeased. Some Cunishuns possess mantrams, with
which they pretend to cast out devils.&rdquo; Captain Conner notes
twenty years later that &ldquo;Kanneans derive the appellation from the
science of divination, which some of their sect profess. The Kannean
fixes the propitious moment for every undertaking, all hysterical
affections being supposed to be the visitation of some troublesome
spirit. His incantations are believed alone able to subdue
it.&rdquo;
The Kaniyans are practically the guiding spirits in all the social
and domestic concerns of Travancoreans, and even Muhammadans and
Christians do not fail to profit by their wisdom. From the moment of
the birth of an infant, which is noted by the Kaniyan for the purpose
of casting its horoscope, to the moment of death, the services of the
village astrologer are constantly in requisition. He is invariably
consulted as to the cause of all calamities, and the cautious answers
that he gives satisfy the people. &ldquo;Putr&#333; na putri,&rdquo;
which may either mean no son but a daughter, or no daughter but a son,
is jocosely referred to as the type of a Kaniyan&rsquo;s answer, when
questioned about the sex of a child in utero. &ldquo;It would be
difficult,&rdquo; Mr. Logan writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2449src"
href="#xd21e2449" name="xd21e2449src">94 &ldquo;to describe a
single important occasion in everyday life when the Kanisan is not at
hand as a guiding spirit, foretelling [<a id=
"pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189]lucky days and hours,
casting horoscopes, explaining the cause of calamities, prescribing
remedies for untoward events, and physicians (not physic) for sick
persons. Seed cannot be sown, or trees planted, unless the Kanisan has
been consulted beforehand. He is even asked to consult his shastras to
find lucky days and moments for setting out on a journey, commencing an
enterprise, giving a loan, executing a deed, or shaving the head. For
such important occasions as births, marriages, tonsure, investiture
with the sacred thread, and beginning the A, B, C, the Kanisan is of
course indispensable. His work in short mixes him up with the gravest
as well as the most trivial of the domestic events of the people, and
his influence and position are correspondingly great. The
astrologer&rsquo;s finding, as one will solemnly assert with all due
reverence, is the oracle of God himself, with the justice of which
everyone ought to be satisfied, and the poorer classes follow his
dictates unhesitatingly. There is no prescribed scale of fees for his
services, and in this respect he is like the native physician and
teacher. Those who consult him, however, rarely come empty-handed, and
the gift is proportioned to the means of the party, and the time spent
in serving him. If no fee is given, the Kanisan does not exact it, as
it is one of his professional characteristics, and a matter of personal
etiquette, that the astrologer should be unselfish, and not greedy of
gain. On public occasions, however, and on important domestic events, a
fixed scale of fees is usually adhered to. The astrologer&rsquo;s most
busy time is from January to July, the period of harvest and of
marriages, but in the other six months of the year his is far from
being an idle life. His most lucrative business lies in casting
horoscopes, recording the events of a man&rsquo;s life from birth to
death, pointing [<a id="pb190" href="#pb190"
name="pb190">190]out dangerous periods of life, and
prescribing rules and ceremonies to be observed by individuals for the
purpose of propitiating the gods and planets, and so averting the
calamities of dangerous times. He also shows favourable junctures for
the commencement of undertakings, and the grantham or book, written on
palmyra leaf, sets forth in considerable detail the person&rsquo;s
disposition and mental qualities, as affected by the position of the
planets in the zodiac at the moment of birth. All this is a work of
labour, and of time. There are few members of respectable families who
are not thus provided, and nobody grudges the five to twenty-five
rupees usually paid for a horoscope according to the position and
reputation of the astrologer. Two things are essential to the
astrologer, namely, a bag of cowry shells (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Cypr&aelig;a moneta), and an almanac. When any one comes
to consult him, he quietly sits down, facing the sun, on a plank seat
or mat, murmuring some mantrams or sacred verses, opens his bag of
cowries, and pours them on the floor. With his right hand he moves them
slowly round and round, solemnly reciting meanwhile a stanza or two in
praise of his guru or teacher, and of his deity, invoking their help.
He then stops, and explains what he has been doing, at the same time
taking a handful of cowries from the heap, and placing them on one
side. In front is a diagram drawn with chalk on the floor, and
consisting of twelve compartments (r&#257;sis) one for each month in
the year. Before commencing operations with the diagram, he selects
three or five of the cowries highest up in the heap, and places them in
a line on the right-hand side. [In an account before me, three cowries
and two glass bottle-stoppers are mentioned as being placed on this
side.] These represent Ganapati (the belly god, the remover of
difficulties), the sun, the planet Jupiter, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191]Sarasvati (the goddess of speech), and his own
guru or preceptor. To all of these the astrologer gives due obeisance,
touching his ears and the ground three times with both hands. The
cowries are next arranged in the compartments of the diagram, and are
moved about from compartment to compartment by the astrologer, who
quotes meanwhile the authority on which he makes the moves. Finally he
explains the result, and ends with again worshipping the deified
cowries, who were witnessing the operation as spectators.&rdquo;
According to another account,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2462src" href=
"#xd21e2462" name="xd21e2462src">95 the astrologer &ldquo;pours his
cowries on the ground, and, after rolling them in the palm of his right
hand, while repeating mantrams (consecrated formul&aelig;), he selects
the largest, and places them in a row outside the diagram at its right
hand top corner. They represent the first seven planets, and he does
obeisance to them, touching his forehead and the ground three times
with both hands. The relative position of the nine planets is then
worked out, and illustrated with cowries in the diagram.&rdquo;
At the chal (furrow) ceremony in Malabar, on the eve of the new
agricultural year, &ldquo;every Hindu house in the district is visited
by the Kanisans of the respective d&#275;sams, who, for a modest
present of rice, vegetables and oils, makes a forecast of the
season&rsquo;s prospects, which is engrossed on a cadjan (palm leaf).
This is called the Vishu phalam, which is obtained by comparing the
nativity with the equinox. Special mention is made therein as to the
probable rainfall from the position of the planets&mdash;highly prized
information in a district where there are no irrigation works or large
reservoirs for water.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2467src" href=
"#xd21e2467" name="xd21e2467src">96 [<a id=
"pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192]
The science of astrology is studied and practiced by other castes,
but the Kani house of Pazh&#363;r is the most celebrated. Numerous
stories are related of the astrological skill of the Pazh&#363;r
Kaniyans, of which one relates to the planets Mercury and Venus, who,
arriving at the house of one of the Kaniyans, were asked by him to wait
at the gate. He then jumped into a neighbouring well, to conduct some
prayers with a view to keeping them there permanently. In this task he
succeeded, and even today a prophecy made at that out-house is believed
to be certain of turning out true.
In addition to astrology, the Kaniyans practice sorcery and
exorcism, which are strictly the occupation of the T&#299;nt&#257;
Kaniyans. The process by which devils are driven out is known as
k&#333;lamtullal (a peculiar dance). A troupe of Kaniyans, on being
invited to a house where a person is suspected of being possessed by a
devil, go there wearing masques representing Gandharva, Yakshi,
Bhairava, Rakt&#275;svari, and other demons, and dressed up in tender
cocoanut leaves. Accompanied by music and songs, they rush towards the
affected person, who is seated in the midst of the assembly, and
frighten away the evil spirit. For the cure of disease, which is
considered as incurable by ordinary methods of treatment, a form of
exorcism called k&#257;lap&#257;samtikkuka, or the removal of the rope
or evil influence, is resorted to. In this, two Kaniyans take the
stage, and play the parts of Siva and Yama, while a third recites in
song the story of the immortal Markand&#275;ya.
&ldquo;The Pannikar&rsquo;s astrology,&rdquo; Mr. F. Fawcett
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2478src" href="#xd21e2478" name=

Venus; Sani, Saturn; R&#257;hu; and K&#275;tu. The two last, though not
visible, are, oddly enough, classed as planets by the Panikkar. They
are said to be two parts of an &#256;sura who was cut in two by Vishnu.
The Panikkars also dabble in magic, and I have in my possession a
number of yantrams presented to me by a Panikkar. They should be
written on a thin gold, silver, or copper plate, and worn on the
person. A yantram written on gold is the most effective. As a rule, the
yantram is placed in a little cylinder-case made of silver, fastened to
a string tied round the waist. Many of these are often worn by the same
person. The yantram is sometimes written on cadjan (palm leaf), or
paper. I have one of this kind in my collection, taken from the neck of
a goat. It is common to see them worn on the arm, around the
neck.&rdquo;
The following examples of yantrams are given by Mr.
Fawcett:&mdash;
Aksharam&#257;la.&mdash;Fifty-one letters. Used in connection
with every other yantram. Each letter has its own meaning, and does not
represent any word. In itself this yantram is powerless, but it gives
life to all [<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194]others. It must be written on the same plate as
the other yantram.
S&#363;lini.&mdash;For protection against sorcery or devils,
and to secure the aid of the goddess.
M&#257;ha S&#363;lini.&mdash;To prevent all kinds of harm
through the devils, chief of whom is Pulatini, he who eats infants.
Women wear it to avert miscarriage.
Ganapati.&mdash;To increase knowledge, and put away fear and
shyness.
Sarasvati.&mdash;To enable its possessor to please his
listeners, and increase his knowledge.
Sant&#257;na gopalam.&mdash;As a whole it represents Sr&#299;
Krishna. Used by barren women, so that they may bear children. It may
be traced on a metal plate and worn in the usual way, or on a slab of
butter, which is eaten. When the latter method is adopted, it is
repeated on forty-one consecutive days, during which the woman, as well
as the Panikkar, may not have sexual connection.
Navva.&mdash;Drawn in ashes of cow-dung on a new cloth, and
tied round the waist. It relieves a woman in labour.
Asvar&#363;dha (to climb a horse).&mdash;A person wearing it
is able to cover long distances easily on horseback, and he can make
the most refractory horse amenable by tying it round its neck. It will
also help to cure cattle.
&ldquo;The charms,&rdquo; Mr. Fawcett explains, &ldquo;are entirely
inoperative, unless accompanied in the first place with the mystic
rite, which is the secret of the Panikkar.&rdquo;
Many Kaniyans used formerly to be village schoolmasters, but, with
the abolition of the old methods of teaching, their number is steadily
decreasing. Some of them are clever physicians. Those who have no
pretension to learning live by making palm-leaf umbrellas, which gives
occupation to the women. But the industry [<a id=
"pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195]is fast declining
before the competition of umbrellas imported from foreign
countries.
The Kaniyans worship the sun, the planets, the moon, Gan&#275;sa and
Subramanya, Vishnu, Siva, and Baghavati. On each day of the week, the
planet, which is believed to preside over it, is specially worshipped
by an elaborate process, which is compulsorily gone through for at
least three weeks after a Kaniyan has become proficient in astrology,
and able to make calculations for himself.
It is generally believed that the supreme authority in all social
matters affecting the Kaniyan rests in British Malabar with the
Y&#333;gi already referred to, in Cochin and North Travancore with the
head of the Pazh&#363;r house, and in South Travancore with the eldest
member of a house at Manakkad in Trivandrum, known by the name of
Sankili. Practically, however, the spiritual headmen, called
Kann&#257;lmas, are independent. These Kann&#257;lmas are much
respected, and well paid on festive occasions by every Kaniyan house.
They and other elders sit in judgment on persons guilty of adultery,
commensality with lower castes, and other offences, and inflict
punishments.
The Kaniyans observe both the t&#257;li-kettu ceremony before
puberty, and sambandham after that event. Inheritance is through the
father, and the eldest male of a family has the management of the
ancestral estate. Fraternal polyandry is said to have been common in
olden times, and Mr. Logan observes that, &ldquo;like the P&#257;ndava
brothers, as they proudly point out, the Kanisans used formerly to have
one wife in common among several brothers, and this custom is still
observed by some of them.&rdquo; There is no restriction to the
marriage of widows. [<a id="pb196" href="#pb196"
name="pb196">196]
Concerning polyandry, Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer states that
&ldquo;among the Kaniyans, as well as among Panikkans, polyandry
largely prevails. If the young woman is intended to be the wife of
several brothers, the eldest brother goes to the bride&rsquo;s house,
and gives her the cloth, and takes her home the next day along with her
parents and relations, who are all well entertained. The young woman
and the brothers are seated together, and a sweet preparation is given
to them, which signifies that she has become the common wife of all.
The Kalari M&#363;ppan (N&#257;yar headman of the village) also
declares her to be such. The guests depart, and the bridegroom (the
eldest brother) and the bride are invited to what they call virunnu-oon
(sumptuous meal) in the house of the latter, where they stay for a few
days. The bridegroom then returns home with the wife. The other
brothers, one after another, are similarly entertained along with the
bride at her house. The brothers cannot afford to live together for a
long time, and they go from place to place, earning their livelihood by
astrology. Each brother is at home only for a few days in each month;
hence practically the woman has only one husband at a time. If several
of them happen to be at home together for a few weeks, each in turn
associates with the woman, in accordance with the directions given by
their mother.&rdquo;
The Kaniyans follow high-caste Hindus as regards many of their
ceremonies. They have their name-bestowing, food-giving and tuft-making
ceremonies, and also a superstitious rite called ittaluzhiyuka, or
exorcism in child-birth on the seventh or ninth day after the birth of
a child. A Kaniyan&rsquo;s education begins in his seventh year. In the
sixteenth year a ceremony, corresponding to the upanayana of the higher
castes, is performed. [<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197]For forty-one days after, the
Kann&#257;lma initiates the young Kaniyan into the mysteries of
astrology and witchcraft. He is obliged to worship Subramanya, the
tutelary god of the caste, and abstains from meat and liquor. This may
be taken as the close of his Brahmacharya stage or Sam&#257;vartana, as
marriage cannot take place before the observance of this ceremony.
On the subject of religion, Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer writes that
&ldquo;the Kalari Panikkans and the Kaniyans are generally Saivite
worshippers, but are not disinclined to the worship of Vishnu also. It
is said that their kalaris are forty-two feet long, and contain the
images of forty-two deities. The following are the most important of
them:&mdash;Subrahmanya, Sastha, Ganapati, V&#299;rabhadran, Narasimha,
Ashtabairavas, Hanum&#257;n, and Bhadrak&#257;li. Some of their
kalaris, which were seen by me, contained stone and metal images of
these gods. Every night a lamp is lighted in front of them for their
worship. During the Mandalam (forty days) from the first of Vrischikam
to the tenth of Dhanu (14th November to 25th December), the senior
member of the Panikkan&rsquo;s family bathes early in the morning, and
performs his p&#363;jas to all the gods, making offerings of boiled
rice, plantains and cocoanuts. On the fortieth day, i.e., the
last day of the Mandalam, a grand p&#363;ja is performed individually
to every one of the deities in the kalari, and this lasts for
twenty-four hours, from sunrise to sunrise, when offerings of boiled
rice, parched rice, sheep and fowls are also given. This is the grand
p&#363;ja performed once in the course of the year. Besides this, some
of their deities command their special reverence. For instance,
Subrahmanya is adored for the sake of astrology, Sastha for wealth and
offspring. They are also worshippers of Sakti in any of her following
[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198]manifestations, namely, Bala, Thripura,
Mathangi, Ambika, Durga, Bhadrak&#257;li, the object of which is to
secure accuracy in their astrological predictions. Further, every
member of the caste proficient in astrology daily offers, after an
early bath, his prayers to the seven planets. Among the minor deities
whom they worship, are also Mallan, Mundian, Muni and Ayutha Vadukan,
the first three of which they worship for the prosperity of their
cattle, and the last four for their success in the training of young
men in athletic feats. These deities are represented by stones placed
at the root of some shady tree in their compounds. They also worship
the spirits of their ancestors, on the new-moon nights in Karkadakam
(July-August), Thulam (October-November), and Makaram
(December-January). The Kalari Panikkans celebrate a kind of feast to
the spirits of their female ancestors. This is generally done a few
days before the celebration of a wedding in their houses, and is
probably intended to obtain their blessings for the happy married life
of the bride. This corresponds to the performance of Sumangalia
Prarthana (feast for the spirits of departed virgins and married women)
performed by Br&#257;hmans in their families. At times when small-pox,
cholera, and other pestilential diseases prevail in a village, special
p&#363;jas are offered to M&#257;riamma (the small-pox demon) and
Bhadrak&#257;li, who should be propitiated. On these occasions, their
priest turns Velichap&#257;d (oracle), and speaks to the village men as
if by inspiration, telling them when and how the maladies will
subside.&rdquo;
Kaniyans were formerly buried, but are now, excepting young
children, cremated in a portion of the grounds of the habitation, or in
a spot adjacent thereto. The ashes are collected on the fourth day, and
deposited under water. In memory of the deceased, an annual offering
[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199]of food is made, and an oblation of water
offered on every new moon.
The Potuvans or Kani Kuruppus are the barbers of the Kaniyans, and
have the privilege of being in attendance during marriages and
funerals. It is only after they have sprinkled water in the houses of
polluted Kaniyans that they again become pure. In fact, the Potuvans
stand in the same relation to the Kaniyans as the M&#257;r&#257;ns to
the N&#257;yars. The Potuvans are not expected to shave the
T&#299;nt&#257; Kaniyans.
The Kaniyans are said to keep at a distance of twenty-four feet from
a Br&#257;hman or Kshatriya, and half that distance from a S&#363;dra.
The corresponding distances for a T&#299;nt&#257; Kaniyan are
thirty-six and eighteen feet. This restriction is not fully observed in
Trivandrum, and south of it. It is noted by Mr. Anantha Krishna Iyer
that, on marriage occasions, a N&#257;yar gives a gift of a few annas
and betel leaves to the astrologer, standing close beside him, and yet
there is no pollution. The Malay&#257;lam proverb &ldquo;On marriage
occasions the N&#257;yars give dakshina (gift), almost touching the
hand,&rdquo; refers to this fact. The Kaniyans cannot enter
Br&#257;hmanical temples. They will not receive food from Izhavans,
except in a few villages in central Travancore, but this is a regular
practice with the T&#299;nt&#257; Kaniyans. It is believed that the
Kaniyans proper have no objection to receiving sweetmeats from
Kamm&#257;lans.
The Kaniyans have been summed up as a law-abiding people, who not
infrequently add agriculture to their avocations of village doctor,
prophet, or demon-driver, and are popular with Christians and
Muhammadans as well as with Hindus.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2564src"

Mysore. Their traditional occupation is said to have been military
service, although they follow, at the present day, different pursuits
in different districts. They are usually cattle-breeders and
cultivators in North and South Arcot and Chingleput, and traders in the
southern districts. Most of them are Ling&#257;yats, but a few are
Vaishnavites.&rdquo; &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; it is stated,<a class=

bathe as each of the most important of the marriage ceremonies is
performed, and are alone allowed to cook for, or to touch the happy

bridegroom must not sit on anything but [<a id=
"pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201]woollen
blankets.&rdquo; Some Kannadiyans in the Tanjore district are said to
be weavers. For the following account of the Kannadiyans of the
Chingleput district I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.
About twenty miles from the city of Madras is a big tank (lake)
named after the village of Chembramb&#257;kam, which is close by. The
fertile land surrounding this tank is occupied, among others, by a
colony of Ling&#257;yats, of whom each household, as a rule, owns
several acres of land. With the cultivation thereof, they have the
further occupation of cattle grazing. They utilize the products of the
cow in various ways, and it supplies them with milk, butter and curds,
in the last two of which they carry on a lucrative trade in the city of
Madras. The curds sold by them are very highly appreciated by Madras
Br&#257;hmans, as they have a sour taste caused by keeping them till
fermentation has set in. So great is the demand for their curds that
advances of money are made to them, and regular delivery is thus
secured. Their price is higher than that of the local Madras curds, and
if a Ling&#257;yat buys the latter and sells them at the higher rate,
he is decisively stigmatised as being a &ldquo;local.&rdquo; They will
not even touch sheep and goats, and believe that even the smell of
these animals will make cows and buffaloes barren.
Though the chief settlement of the Ling&#257;yats is at
Chembramb&#257;kam, they are also to be found in the adjacent villages
and in the Conjeeveram t&#257;luk, and, in all, they number, in the
Chingleput district, about four thousand.
The Ling&#257;yats have no idea how their forefathers came to the
Chingleput district. Questioned whether they have any relatives in
Mysore, many answered in the affirmative, and one even pointed to one
in a high [<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202]official position as a close relation. Another
said that the Gurukkal or Jangam (priest) is one and the same man for
the Mysore Ling&#257;yats and themselves. A third told me of his
grandfather&rsquo;s wanderings in Mysore, Bellary, and other places of
importance to the Ling&#257;yats. I have also heard the story that, on
the Chembramb&#257;kam Ling&#257;yats being divided into two factions
through disputes among the local caste-men, a Ling&#257;yat priest came
from Mysore, and brought about their union. These few facts suffice to
show that the Ling&#257;yats are emigrants from Mysore, and not
converts from the indigenous populations of the district. But what as
to the date of their immigration? The earliest date which can, with any
show of reason, be ascribed thereto seems to be towards the end of the
seventeenth century, when Chikka D&#275;va R&#257;ja ruled over Mysore.
He adopted violent repressive measures against the Ling&#257;yats for
quelling a widespread insurrection, which they had fomented against him
throughout the State. His measures of financial reform deprived the
Ling&#257;yat priesthood of its local leadership and much of its
pecuniary profit. What followed may best be stated in the words of
Colonel Wilks,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2625src" href="#xd21e2625"
name="xd21e2625src">102 the Mysore historian. &ldquo;Everywhere the
inverted plough, suspended from the tree at the gate of the village,
whose shade forms a place of assembly for its inhabitants, announced a
state of insurrection. Having determined not to till the land, the
husbandmen deserted their villages, and assembled in some places like
fugitives seeking a distant settlement; in others as rebels breathing
revenge. Chikka D&#275;va R&#257;ja, however, was too prompt in his
measures to admit of any very formidable combination. Before
[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203]proceeding to measures of open violence, he
adopted a plan of perfidy and horror, yielding to nothing which we find
recorded in the annals of the most sanguinary people. An invitation was
sent to all the Jangam priests to meet the R&#257;ja at the great
temple of Nunjeng&#333;d, ostensibly to converse with him on the
subject of the refractory conduct of their followers. Treachery was
apprehended, and the number which assembled was estimated at about four
hundred only. A large pit had been previously prepared in a walled
enclosure, connected by a series of squares composed of tent walls with
the canopy of audience, at which they were received one at a time, and,
after making their obeisance, were desired to retire to a place where,
according to custom, they expected to find refreshments prepared at the
expense of the R&#257;ja. Expert executioners were in waiting in the
square, and every individual in succession was so skilfully beheaded
and tumbled into the pit as to give no alarm to those who followed, and
the business of the public audience went on without interruption or
suspicion. Circular orders had been sent for the destruction on the
same day of all the Jangam Mutts (places of residence and worship) in
his dominions, and the number reported to have been destroyed was
upwards of seven hundred.... This notable achievement was followed by
the operations of the troops, chiefly cavalry. The orders were distinct
and simple&mdash;to charge without parley into the midst of the mob; to
cut down every man wearing an orange-coloured robe (the peculiar garb
of the Jangam priests).&rdquo;
How far the husbandmen carried out their threat of seeking a distant
settlement it is impossible, at this distance of time, to determine. If
the theory of religious [<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204]persecution as the cause of their
emigration has not an air of certainty about it, it is at least
plausible.
If the beginning of the eighteenth century is the earliest, the end
of that century is the latest date that can be set down for the
Ling&#257;yat emigration. That century was perhaps the most troublous
one in the modern history of India. Armies were passing and repassing
the gh&#257;ts, and I have heard from some old gentlemen that the
Chingleput Ling&#257;yats, who are mostly shepherds, accompanied the
troops in the humble capacity of purveyors of milk and butter.
Whatever the causes of their emigration, we find them in the
Chingleput district ordinarily reckoning the Mysore, Salem and Bellary
Ling&#257;yats as of their own stock. They freely mix with each other,
and I hear contract marital alliances with one another. They speak the
Kannada (Kanarese) language&mdash;the language of Mysore and Bellary.
They call themselves by the name of Kannadiyans or Kannadiyars, after
the language they speak, and the part of the village they
inhabit&mdash;Kannadipauliem, or village of the Kannadiyars. In parts
of Madras they are known as Kavadi and Kavadiga (=bearers of
head-loads).
Both men and women are possessed of great stamina. Almost every
other day they walk to and fro, in all seasons, more than twenty miles
by road to sell their butter and curds in Madras. While so journeying,
they carry on their heads a curd pot in a rattan basket containing
three or four Madras measures of curds, besides another pot containing
a measure or so of butter. Some of the men are good acrobats and
gymnasts, and I have seen a very old man successively break in two four
cocoanuts, each placed on three or four crystals of common salt,
leaving the crystals almost [<a id="pb205" href=
"#pb205" name="pb205">205]intact. And I have heard that
there are men who can so break fifty cocoanuts&mdash;perhaps an
exaggeration for a considerable number. In general the women may be
termed beautiful, and, in Mysore, the Ling&#257;yat women are, by
common consent, regarded as models of feminine beauty.
These Ling&#257;yats are divided into two classes, viz., Gauliyars
of D&#257;mara village, and Kadap&#275;ri or Kannadiyars proper, of
Chembramb&#257;kam and other places. The Gauliyars carry their curd
pots in rattan baskets; the Kannadiyars in bamboo baskets. Each class
has its own beat in the city of Madras, and, while the majority of the
rattan basket men traffic mainly in Triplicane, the bamboo basket men
carry on their business in Georgetown and other localities. The two
classes worship the same gods, feed together, but do not intermarry.
The rattan is considered superior to the bamboo section. Both sections
are sub-divided into a large number of exogamous septs or
b&#275;dagagulu, of which the meaning, with a few exceptions,
e.g., split cane, bear, and fruit of Eugenia Jambolana,
is not clear.
Monogamy appears to be the general rule among them, but polygamy to
the extent of having two wives, the second to counteract the sterility
of the first, is not rare. Marriage before puberty is the rule, which
must not be transgressed. And it is a common thing to see small boys
grazing the cattle, who are married to babies hardly more than a year
old. Marriages are arranged by the parents, or through intermediaries,
with the tacit approval of the community as a whole. The marriage
ceremony generally lasts about nine or ten days, and, to lessen the
expenses for the individual, several families club together and
celebrate their marriages simultaneously. All the preliminaries such as
inviting the [<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206]wedding guests, etc., are attended to by the
agent of the community, who is called Chaudri. The appointment of agent
is hereditary.
The first day of the marriage ceremony is employed in the erection
of the booth or pandal. On the following day, the bodice-wearing
ceremony is performed. The bride and bridegroom are presented with new
clothes, which they put on amid general merriment. In connection with
this ceremony, the following Mysore story may not be out of place. When
Tipu Sultan once saw a Ling&#257;yat woman selling curds in the street
without a body cloth, he ordered the cutting off of her breasts. Since
then the wearing of long garments has come into use among the whole
female population of Mysore.
The third day is the most important, as it is on that day that the
Muh&#363;rtham, or t&#257;li-tying ceremony, takes place, and an
incident of quite an exceptional character comes off amid general
laughter. A Br&#257;hman (generally a Saivite) is formally invited to
attend, and pretends that he is unable to do so. But he is, with mock
gravity, pressed hard to do so, and, after repeated guarantees of good
faith, he finally consents with great reluctance and misgivings. On his
arrival at the marriage booth, the headman of the family in which the
marriage is taking place seizes him roughly by the head, and ties as
tightly as possible five cocoanuts to the kudumi, or lock of hair at
the back of the head, amidst the loud, though not real, protestations
of the victim. All those present, with all seriousness, pacify him, and
he is cheered by the sight of five rupees, which are presented to him.
This gift he readily accepts, together with a pair of new cloths and
p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri (betel leaves and areca nuts). Meanwhile the young
folk have been making sport of him by throwing at his new and old
clothes big empty [<a id="pb207" href="#pb207"
name="pb207">207]brinjal fruits (Solanum Melongena)
filled with turmeric powder and chun&#257;m (lime). He goes for the
boys, who dodge him, and at last the elders beat off the youngsters
with the remark that &ldquo;after all he is a Br&#257;hman, and ought
not to be trifled with in this way.&rdquo; The Br&#257;hman then takes
leave, and is heard of no more in connection with the wedding rites.
The whole ceremony has a decided ring of mockery about it, and leads
one to the conclusion that it is celebrated more in derision than in
honour of the Br&#257;hmans. It is a notorious fact that the
Ling&#257;yats will not even accept water from a Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s
hands, and do not, like many other castes, require his services in
connection with marriage or funeral ceremonies. The practice of tying
cocoanuts to the hair of the Br&#257;hman seems to be confined to the
bamboo section. But an equally curious custom is observed by the rattan
section. The village barber is invited to the wedding, and the infant
bride and bridegroom are seated naked before him. He is provided with
some gh&#299;(clarified butter) in a cocoanut shell, and has to
sprinkle some of it on the head of the couple with a grass or reed. He
is, however, prevented from doing so by a somewhat cruel contrivance. A
big stone (representing the linga) is suspended from his neck by a
rope, and he is kept nodding to and fro by another rope which is pulled
by young lads behind him. Eventually they leave off, and he sprinkles
the gh&#299;, and is dismissed with a few annas, p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri,
and the remains of the gh&#299;. By means of the stone the barber is
for the moment turned into a Ling&#257;yat.
The officiating priest at the marriage ceremony is a man of their
own sect, and is known as the Gurukkal. They address him as Ayyanavaru,
a title generally reserved for Br&#257;hmans in Kannada-speaking
districts. [<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208]The main items of expenditure at a wedding are
the musician, presents of clothes, and p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri, especially
the areca nuts. One man, who was not rich, told me that it cost him,
for a marriage, three maunds of nuts, and that guests come more for
them than for the meals, which he characterised as not fit for
dogs.

Widow remarriage is permitted. But it is essential that the
contracting parties should be widower and widow. For such a marriage no
pandal is erected, but all the elders countenance it by their presence.
Such a marriage is known as naduv&#299;ttu t&#257;li, because the
t&#257;li is tied in the mid-house. It is usually a simple affair, and
finished in a short time after sunset instead of in the day time. The
offspring of such marriages are considered as legitimate, and can
inherit. But remarried couples are disqualified from performing certain
acts, e.g., the distribution of p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri at
weddings, partaking in the h&#257;rathi ceremony, etc. The
disqualifications attaching to remarried people are, by a curious
analogy, extended to deformed persons, who are, in some cases,
considered to be widowers and widows.
Among the ordinary names of males are Basappa, Linganna,
D&#275;vanna, Ellappa, Naganna; and of females Ellamma, Lingi and
N&#257;gamma. It is said that all are entitled to the honorific Saudri;
but the title is specially reserved for the agent of their sect. Among
common nicknames are Chikka and Dodda Thamma (younger and elder
brother), &#256;ndi (beggar), Karapi (black woman), G&#363;ni (hunch
back). In the Mysore Province the most becoming method of addressing a
Ling&#257;yat is to call him Sivan&#275;. Their usual titles are Ravut,
Appa, Anna, and Saudri.
The child-naming ceremony is a very important one. Five swords with
limes fixed to their edges are set in [<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209]a line with
equi-distant spaces between them. By each sword are placed two plantain
fruits, a cocoanut, four dried dates, two cocoanut cups,
p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri, and k&#257;r&#257;mani (Vigna Catiang)
cakes. In front of the swords are also placed rice-balls mixed with
turmeric powder, various kinds of vegetables and fruits, curds and
milk. Opposite each sword five leaves are spread out, and in front of
each leaf a near relation of the family sits. The chief woman of the
house then brings five pots full of water, and gives to each man a
potful for the worship of the jangama linga which he wears. She also
brings consecrated cow-dung ashes. The men pour the water over the
linga, holding it in the left hand, and smear both the linga and their
faces with the ashes. The woman then retires, and the guests partake of
a hearty meal, at the conclusion of which the woman reappears with five
vessels full of water, with which they wash their hands. The vessels
are then broken, and thrown on a dung-heap. After partaking of
p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri and chun&#257;m (lime), each of the men ties up
some of the food in a towel, takes one of the swords in his hand, and
leaves the house without turning back. The headman of the family then
removes the limes from the swords, and puts them back in their
scabbards. The same evening the child is named. Sometimes this
ceremony, which is costly, is held even after the child is a year
old.
When a death takes place, information is sent round to the relations
and castemen by two boys carrying little sticks in their hands. Under
the instructions of a priest, the inmates of the house begin to make
arrangements for the funeral. The corpse is washed, and the
priest&rsquo;s feet are also washed, and the refuse-water on the ground
is poured over the corpse or into [<a id="pb210"
href="#pb210" name="pb210">210]its mouth. Among certain
sections of Ling&#257;yats it is customary, contrary to the usual Hindu
practice, to invite the friends and relations, who have come for the
funeral, to a banquet, at which the priest is a guest. It is said that
the priest, after partaking of food, vomits a portion of it, which is
shared by the members of the family. These practices do not seem to be
followed by the Chingleput Ling&#257;yats. A second bath is given to
the corpse, and then the nine orifices of the body are closed with
cotton or cloth. The corpse is then dressed as in life, and, if it be
that of a priest, is robed in the characteristic orange tawny dress.
Before clothing it, the consecrated cow-dung ashes are smeared over the
forehead, arms, chest, and abdomen. The bier is made like a car, such
as is seen in temple processions on the occasion of car festivals. To
each of its four bamboo posts are attached a plantain tree and a
cocoanut, and it is decorated with bright flowers. In the middle of the
bier is a wooden plank, on which the corpse is set in a sitting
position. The priest touches the dead body three or four times with his
right leg, and the funeral cort&egrave;ge, accompanied by weird village
music, proceeds to the burial-ground. The corpse, after removal from
the bier, is placed in the grave in a sitting posture, facing south,
with the linga, which the man had worn during life, in the mouth. Salt,
according to the means of the family, is thrown into the grave by
friends and relations, and it is considered that a man&rsquo;s life
would be wasted if he did not do this small service for a dead
fellow-casteman. They quote the proverb &ldquo;Did he go unserviceable
even for a handful of mud?&rdquo; The grave is filled in, and four
lights are placed at the corners. The priest, standing over the head of
the corpse, faces the lamps, with branches of Leucas aspera and
Vitex Negundo at [<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211]his feet. A cocoanut is broken and
camphor burnt, and the priest says &ldquo;Lingannah (or whatever the
name of the dead man may be), leaving Nara Loka, you have gone to Bhu
Loka,&rdquo; which is a little incongruous, for Nara Loka and Bhu Loka
are identical. Perhaps the latter is a mistake for Swarga Loka, the
abode of bliss of Br&#257;hmanical theology. Possibly, Swarga Loka is
not mentioned, because it signifies the abode of Vishnu. Then the
priest calls out Oogay! Oogay! and the funeral ceremony is at an end.
On their return home the corpse-bearers, priest, and sons of the
deceased, take buttermilk, and apply it with the right hand to the left
side of the back. A Nandi (the sacred bull) is made of mud, or bricks
and mortar, and set up over the grave. Unmarried girls and boys are
buried in a lying position. From enquiries made among the
Ling&#257;yats of Chembaramb&#257;kam, it appears that, when a death
has occurred, pollution is observed by the near relatives; and, even if
they are living at such distant places as Bellary or Bangalore,
pollution must be observed, and dissolved by a bath.
Basava attached no importance to pilgrimages. The Chingleput
Ling&#257;yats, however, perform what they call J&#257;tray
(i.e., pilgrimage), of which the principal celebration takes
place in Chittra-Vyasi (April-May), and is called V&#299;rabhadra
J&#257;tray. The bamboo Ling&#257;yats of Chembaramb&#257;kam send
word, with some raw rice, to the rattan Ling&#257;yats of Kadap&#275;ri
to come to the festival on a fixed day with the image of their god
V&#299;rabhadra. The Gauliyars of Kadap&#275;ri and other villages
accordingly proceed to a tank on the confines of the village of
Chembramb&#257;kam, and send word that they have responded to the call
of their brethren. The chief men of the village, accompanied by a
crowd, and the village [<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212]musicians, start for the tank, and
bring in the Kadap&#275;ri guests. After a feast all retire for the
night, and get up at 3 A.M. for the celebration
of the festival. Swords are unsheathed from their scabbards, and there
is a deafening noise from trumpets and pipes. The images of
V&#299;rabhadra are taken in procession to a tank, and, on the way
thither, the idol bearers and others pretend that they are inspired,
and bawl out the various names of the god. Sometimes they become so
frenzied that the people break cocoanuts on their foreheads, or pierce
their neck and wrists with a big needle, such as is used in stitching
gunny bags. Under this treatment the inspired ones calm down. All along
the route cocoanuts are broken, and may amount to as many as four
hundred, which become the perquisite of the village washerman. When the
tank is reached, p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri and kadalai (Cicer
arietinum) are distributed among the crowd. On the return journey,
the village washerman has to spread dupatis (cloths) for the procession
to walk over. At about noon a hearty meal is partaken of, and the
ceremony is at an end. After a few days, a return celebration takes
place at Kadap&#275;ri. The V&#299;rabhadra images of the two sections,
it may be noted, are regarded as brothers. Other ceremonial pilgrimages
are also made to Tirut&#257;ni, Tiruvall&#363;r and Mylapore, and they
go to Tiruvall&#363;r on new moon days, bathe in the tank, and make
offerings to V&#299;ra R&#257;ghava, a Vaishnava deity. They do not
observe the feast of Pongal, which is so widely celebrated throughout
Southern India. It is said that the celebration thereof was stopped,
because, on one occasion, the cattle bolted, and the men who went in
pursuit of them never returned. The Ug&#257;di, or new year feast, is
observed by them as a day of general mourning. They also observe the
K&#257;ma festival with great &eacute;clat, and one <span class=
"pagenum">[213]of
their national songs relates to the burning of K&#257;ma. When singing
it during their journeys with the curd-pots, they are said to lose
themselves, and arrive at their destination without knowing the
distance that they have marched.
In addition to the grand V&#299;rabhadra festival, which is
celebrated annually, the Aris&#275;rvai festival is also observed as a
great occasion. This is no doubt a Tamil rendering of the Sanskrit
Haris&#275;rvai, which means the service of Hari or worship of Vishnu.
It is strange that Ling&#257;yats should have this formal worship of
Vishnu, and it must be a result of their environment, as they are
surrounded on all sides by Vaishnavite temples. More than six months
before the festival a meeting of elders is convened, and it is decided
that an assessment of three pies per basket shall be levied, and the
Saudri is made honorary treasurer of the fund. If a house has two or
more baskets, i.e., persons using baskets in their trade, it
must contribute a corresponding number of three pies. In other words,
the basket, and not the family, is the unit in their communal finance.
An invitation, accompanied by p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri, is sent to the
Th&#257;dans (Vaishnavite dramatists) near Conjeeveram, asking them to
attend the festival on the last Saturday of Parat&#257;si, the four
Saturdays of which month are consecrated to Vishnu. The Th&#257;dans
arrive in due course at Chembramb&#257;kam, the centre of the bamboo
section of the Ling&#257;yats, and make arrangements for the festival.
Invitations are sent to five persons of the Ling&#257;yat community,
who fast from morning till evening. About 8 or 9 <span class=
"sc">P.M., these five guests, who perhaps represent priests for
the occasion, arrive at the pandal (booth), and leaves are spread out
before them, and a meal of rice, dhal (Cajanus indicus) water,
cakes, broken cocoanuts, [<a id="pb214" href=
"#pb214" name="pb214">214]etc., is served to them. But,
instead of partaking thereof, they sit looking towards a lighted lamp,
and close their eyes in meditation. They then quietly retire to their
homes, where they take the evening meal. After a torchlight procession
with torches fed with gh&#299; (clarified butter) the village washermen
come to the pandal, and collect together the leaves and food, which
have been left there. About 11 P.M. the
villagers repair to the spot where a dramatic performance of Hiranya
Kasyapa N&#257;takam, or the Prahall&#257;da Charitram, is held during
five alternate nights. The latter play is based on a favourite story in
the Bh&#257;gavatha, and it is strange that it should be got up and
witnessed by a community of Saivites, some of whom (V&#299;ra Saivas)
are such extremists that they would not tolerate the sight of a
Vaishnavite at a distance.
The Chembramb&#257;kam Ling&#257;yats appear to join the other
villagers in the performance of the annual p&#363;ja (worship) to the
village deity, N&#257;mamdamma, who is worshipped in order to ward off
cholera and cattle disease. One mode of propitiating her is by
sacrificing a goat, collecting its entrails and placing them in a pot,
with its mouth covered with goat skin, which is taken round the
village, and buried in a corner. The pot is called Bali S&#275;tti, and
he who comes in front of it while it is being carried through the
streets, is supposed to be sure to suffer from serious illness, or even
die. The sacrifice, filling of the pot, and its carriage through the
streets, are all performed by low class &#332;cchans and
Vettiy&#257;ns. The Chembramb&#257;kam Ling&#257;yats assert that the
cholera goddess has given a promise that she will not attack any of
their community, and keeps it faithfully, and none of them die even
during the worst cholera epidemics. [<a id=

Kanni (rope).&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Kurni.
Kapata.&mdash;A name for rag-wearing Koragas.
Kappala (frog).&mdash;An exogamous sept of M&#257;diga, and
sub-division of Y&#257;n&#257;dis, who are said to be frog-eaters. It
is also a g&#333;tra of Janappans, who have a legend that, when some of
their family were fishing, they caught a haul of big frogs instead of
fish. Consequently, members of this g&#333;tra will not injure frogs. I
have seen frogs hanging up for sale in the Cochin baz&#257;r.
K&#257;ppiliyan.&mdash;The K&#257;ppiliyans, or
Karumpurathth&#257;ls, as they are sometimes called, are
Canarese-speaking farmers, who are found chiefly in Madura and
Tinnevelly. It is noted, in the Manual of the Madura district, that
&ldquo;a few of the original Poligars were Canarese; and it is to be
presumed that the K&#257;ppiliyans immigrated under their auspices.
They are a decent and respectable class of farmers. Their most common
agnomen is Koundan (or Kavandan).&rdquo;
Some K&#257;ppiliyans say that they came south six or seven
generations ago, along with the Urumikk&#257;rans, from the banks of
the Tungabhadra river, because the Tottiyans tried to ravish their
women. According to another tradition, similar to that current among
the Tottiyans, &ldquo;the caste was oppressed by the Musalmans of the
north, fled across the Tungabhadra, and was saved by two pongu
(Pongamia glabra) trees bridging an unfordable stream, which
blocked their escape. They travelled, says the legend, through Mysore
to Conjeeveram, thence to Coimbatore, and thence to the Madura
district. The stay at Conjeeveram is always emphasised, and is
supported by the fact that the caste has shrines dedicated to
K&#257;nchi Varadar&#257;ja Perum&#257;l.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2755src" href="#xd21e2755" name="xd21e2755src">103
[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=

The K&#257;ppiliyans are one of the nine Kambalam castes, who are so
called because, at their caste council meetings, a kambli (blanket) is
spread, on which is placed a kalasam (brass vessel) filled with water,
and decorated with flowers. Its mouth is closed by mango leaves and a
cocoanut. According to the Gazetteer of the Madura district, they are
&ldquo;split into two endogamous sub-divisions, namely the Dharmakattu,
so called because, out of charity, they allow widows to marry one more
husband, and the M&#363;nukattu, who permit a woman to have three
husbands in succession.&rdquo; They are also said to recognise, among
themselves, four sub-divisions, Vokkiliyan (cultivator), M&#363;ru
Balayan&#333;ru (three bangle people), Bottu Katt&#333;ru (bottu tying
people), Vokkuloth&#333;ru, to the last of which the following notes
mainly refer.
They have a large number of exogamous septs, which are further
divided into exogamous sub-septs, of which the following are
examples:&mdash;

One exogamous sept is called &#256;n&#275; (elephant), and as names
of sub-septs, named after animate or inanimate objects, I may mention
Hatti (hamlet), Aran&#275; (lizard) and Puli (tiger). <span class=
"pagenum">[217]
The affairs of the caste are regulated by a headman called Gauda,
assisted by the Saundari. In some places, the assistance of a Pallan or
Maravan called J&#257;dipillai, is sought.
Marriage is, as a rule, adult, and the common emblem of married
life&mdash;the t&#257;li or bottu&mdash;is dispensed with. On the first
day of the marriage ceremonies, the bride and bridegroom are conducted,
towards evening, to the houses of their maternal uncles. There the
nalagu ceremony, or smearing the body with Phaseolus Mungo,
sandal and turmeric paste, is performed, and the uncles place toe-rings
on the feet of the contracting couple. On the following day, the
bride&rsquo;s price is paid, and betel is distributed, in the presence
of a Kummara, Urumikk&#257;ran, and washerman, to the villagers in a
special order of precedence. On the third day, the bridegroom goes in
procession to the house of the bride, and their fingers are linked
together by the maternal uncle or uncles. For this reason, the day is
called Kai Kuduk&#257;hodina, or hand-locking day.
It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Madura district, that
&ldquo;the binding portions of the marriage ceremony are the donning by
the bride of a turmeric-coloured cloth sent her by bridegroom, and of
black glass bangles (unmarried girls may only wear bangles made of
lac), and the linking of the couple&rsquo;s little fingers. A
man&rsquo;s right to marry his paternal aunt&rsquo;s daughter is so
rigorously insisted upon that, as among the Tottiyans, ill-assorted
matches are common. A woman, whose husband is too young to fulfil the
duties of his position, is allowed to consort with his near relations,
and the children so begotten are treated as his. [It is said that a
woman does not suffer in reputation, if she cohabits with her
brothers-in-law.] Adultery outside the caste is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218]punished by expulsion, and, to show that the
woman is thenceforward as good as dead, funeral ceremonies are solemnly
performed to some trinket of hers, and this is afterwards
burnt.&rdquo;
At the first menstrual period, a girl remains under pollution for
thirteen days, in a corner of the house or outside it in the village
common land (mandai). If she remains within, her maternal uncle makes a
screen, and, if outside, a temporary hut, and, in return for his
services, receives a hearty meal. On the thirteenth day the girl bathes
in a tank (pond), and, as she enters the house, has to pass over a
pestle and a cake. Near the entrance, some food is placed, which a dog
is allowed to eat. While so doing, it receives a severe beating. The
more noise it makes, the better is the omen for a large family of
children. If the poor brute does not howl, it is supposed that the girl
will bear no children. A cotton thread, dyed with turmeric, is tied
round her neck by a married woman, and, if she herself is married, she
puts on glass bangles. The hut is burnt down and the pots she used are
broken to atoms.
The caste deities are said to be Lakkamma and V&#299;ra Lakkamma,
but they also worship other deities, such as Chenr&#257;ya, Thimmappa,
and Siranga Perumal. Certain septs seem to have particular deities,
whom they worship. Thus Thimmar&#257;ya is reverenced by the
Dasiriy&#333;ru, and Malamma by the Hattiy&#333;ru.
The dead are as a rule cremated, but children, those who have died
of cholera, and pregnant women, are buried. In the case of the last,
the child is, before burial, removed from the mother&rsquo;s body. The
funeral ceremonies are carried out very much on the lines of those of
the Tottiyans. Fire is carried to the burning ground by a Chakkiliyan.
On the last day of the death [<a id="pb219" href=
"#pb219" name="pb219">219]ceremonies (karm&#257;ndiram)
cooked food, fruits of Solanum xanthocarpum, and leaves of
Leucas aspera are placed on a tray, by the side of which a bit
of a culm of Saccharum arundinaceum, with leaves of Cynodon
Dactylon twined round it, is deposited. The tray is taken to a
stream, on the bank of which an effigy is made, to which the various
articles are offered. A small quantity thereof is placed on arka
(Calotropis gigantea) leaves, to be eaten by crows. On the
return journey to the house, three men, the brother-in-law or
father-in-law of the deceased, and two sapindas (agnates) stand in a
row at a certain spot. A cloth is stretched before them as a screen,
over which they place their right hands. These a washerman touches
thrice with Cynodon leaves dipped in milk, cow&rsquo;s urine,
and turmeric water. The washerman then washes the hands with water. All
the agnates place new turbans on their heads, and go back in procession
to the village, accompanied by a Urimikk&#257;ran and washerman, who
must be present throughout the ceremony.
For the following note on the K&#257;ppiliyans of the Kambam valley,
in the Madura district, I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao.
According to a tradition which is current among them, they migrated
from their original home in search of new grazing ground for their
cattle. The herd, which they brought with them, still lives in its
descendants in the valley, which are small, active animals, well known
for their trotting powers. It is about a hundred and fifty strong, and
is called d&#275;varu &#257;vu in Canarese, and thambir&#257;n
m&#257;du in Tamil, both meaning the sacred herd. The cows are never
milked, and their calves, when they grow up, are not used for any
purpose, except breeding. When the cattle die, they are buried deep in
the ground, and not handed [<a id="pb220" href=
"#pb220" name="pb220">220]over to Chakkiliyans
(leather-workers). One of the bulls goes by the name of pattada
&#257;vu, or the king bull. It is selected from the herd by a quaint
ceremonial. On an auspicious day, the castemen assemble, and offer
incense, camphor, cocoanuts, plantains, and betel to the herd.
Meanwhile, a bundle of sugar-cane is placed in front thereof, and the
spectators eagerly watch to see which of the bulls will reach it first.
The animal which does so is caught hold of, daubed with turmeric, and
decorated with flowers, and installed as the king bull. It is styled
Nanda G&#333;p&#257;la, or Venug&#333;p&#257;lasw&#257;mi, after
Krishna, the divine cattle-grazer, and is an object of adoration by the
caste. To meet the expenses of the ceremony, which amount to about two
hundred rupees, a subscription is raised among them. The king bull has
a special attendant, or driver, whose duties are to graze and worship
it. He belongs to the M&#257;ragala section of the End&#257;r
sub-division of the caste. When he dies, a successor is appointed in
the following manner. Before the assembled castemen, p&#363;ja
(worship) is offered to the sacred herd, and a young boy, &ldquo;upon
whom the god comes,&rdquo; points out a man from among the
M&#257;ragalas, who becomes the next driver. He enjoys the inams, and
is the custodian of the jewels presented to the king bull in former
days, and of the copper plates, whereon grants made in its name are
engraved. As many as nine of these copper grants were entrusted to the
keeping of a youthful driver, about sixteen years old, in 1905. Most of
them record grants from unknown kings. One Ponnum P&#257;ndyan, a king
of Gudal&#363;r, is recorded as having made grants of land, and other
presents to the bull. Others record gifts of land from Ball&#257;la
R&#257;ya and R&#257;ma R&#257;yar. Only the names of the years are
recorded. None of the plates contain the saka <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name=
"pb221">221]dates. Before the annual migration of the herd
to the hills during the summer, a ceremony is carried out, to determine
whether the king bull is in favour of its going. Two plates, one
containing milk, and the other sugar, are placed before the herd.
Unless, or until the bull has come up to them, and gone back, the
migration does not take place. The driver, or some one deputed to
represent him, goes with the herd, which is accompanied by most of the
cattle of the neighbouring villages. The driver is said to carry a pot
of fresh-drawn milk within a k&#257;vadi (shrine). On the day on which
the return journey to the valley is commenced, the pot is opened, and
the milk is said to be found in a hardened state. A slice thereof is
cut off, and given to each person who accompanied the herd to the
hills. It is believed that the milk would not remain in good condition,
if the sacred herd had been in any way injuriously affected during its
sojourn there. The sacred herd is recruited by certain calves dedicated
as members thereof by people of other castes in the neighbourhood of
the valley. These calves, born on the 1st of the month Thai
(January-February), are dedicated to the god Nandag&#333;p&#257;la, and
are known as sanni pasuvu. They are branded on the legs or buttocks,
and their ears are slightly torn. They are not used for ploughing or
milking, and cannot be sold. They are added to the sacred herd, but the
male calves are kept distinct from the male calves thereof. Many
miracles are attributed to the successive king bulls. During the fight
between the Tottiyans and K&#257;ppiliyans at Dindigul, a king bull
left on the rock the permanent imprint of its hoof, which is still
believed to be visible. At a subsequent quarrel between the same
castes, at Dombach&#275;ri, a king bull made the sun turn back in its
course, and the shadow [<a id="pb222" href=
"#pb222" name="pb222">222]is still pointed under a tamarind
tree beneath which arbitration took place. For the assistance rendered
by the bull on this occasion, the M&#257;ragalas will not use the wood
of the tamarind tree, or of the v&#275;la tree, to which the bull was
tied, either for fuel or for house-building. The K&#257;ppiliyans have
recently (1906) raised Rs. 11,000 by taxing all members of the caste in
the Periyakulam t&#257;luk for three years, and have spent this sum in
building roomy masonry quarters at Kambam for the sacred herd. Their
chief grievance at present is that the same grazing fees are levied on
their animals as on mere ordinary cattle, which, they urge, is
equivalent to treating gods as equals of men. In the settlement of
caste affairs, oaths are taken within the enclosure for the sacred
herd.
&ldquo;Local tradition at Kambam (where a large proportion of the
people are K&#257;ppiliyans) says that the Anuppans, another Canarese
caste, were in great strength here in olden days, and that quarrels
arose between the two bodies, in the course of which the chief of the
K&#257;ppiliyans, R&#257;machcha Kavundan, was killed. With his dying
breath he cursed the Anuppans, and thenceforth they never prospered,
and now not one of them is left in the town. A fig tree to the east of
the village is shown as marking the place where R&#257;machcha&rsquo;s
body was burned; near it is the tank, the R&#257;machchankulam; and
under the bank of this is his math, where his ashes were
deposited.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2861src" href="#xd21e2861"

name="pb223">223]land-holding body in the Telugu districts,
who are held in much respect as substantial, steady-going yeomen, and
next to the Br&#257;hmans are the leaders of Hindu Society. In the
Salem Manual it is stated that &ldquo;the Reddis are provident. They
spend their money on the land, but are not parsimonious. They are
always well dressed, if they can afford it. The gold ornaments worn by
the women or the men are of the finest kind of gold. Their houses are
always neat and well built, and the Reddis give the idea of good
substantial ryots. They live chiefly on r&#257;gi (grain: Eleusine
Coracana), and are a fine, powerful race.&rdquo; Of proverbs
relating to the hereditary occupation of the Reddis, the following may
be quoted. &ldquo;Only a Reddi can cultivate the land, even though he
has to drink for every clod turned over.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those are Reddis
who get their living by cultivating the earth.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Reddi
who grows arika (Paspalum strobiculatum) can have but one cloth
for man and wife.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The term K&#257;pu,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2878src" href="#xd21e2878" name=
"xd21e2878src">105 &ldquo;means a watchman, and Reddi means a king.
The K&#257;pus or Reddis (Ratti) appear to have been a powerful
Dravidian tribe in the early centuries of the Christian era, for they
have left traces of their presence at various places in almost every
part of India. Though their power has been put down from time to time
by the Ch&#257;lukyas, the Pallavas, and the Bell&#257;las, several
families of zamindars came into existence after the captivity of
Prat&#257;pa Rudra of Warrangal in A.D. 1323 by the Muhammadan emperor
Ghiyas-ud-d&#299;n Toghluk.&rdquo;
Writing in the Manual of the Salem district concerning the Kongu
kingdom, the Rev. T. Foulkes states that &ldquo;the Kongu kingdom
claims to have existed from [<a id="pb224" href=
"#pb224" name="pb224">224]about the commencement of the
Christian era, and to have continued under its own independent kings
down to nearly the end of the ninth century A.D., when it was conquered
by the Chola kings of Tanjore, and annexed to their dominions. The
earliest portion of the Kongu Chronicle (one of the manuscripts of the
Mackenzie collection) gives a series of short notices of the reigns of
twenty-eight kings who ruled the country previous to its conquest by
the Cholas. These kings belonged to two distinct dynasties: the earlier
line was of the solar race, and the later line of the Ganga race. The
earlier dynasty had a succession of seven kings of the Ratti tribe, a
tribe very extensively distributed, which has at various periods left
its mark throughout almost every part of India. This is probably the
earliest reference to them as a ruling power, and it is the most
southern situation in which they ever held dominion. They disappear in
these parts about the end of the second century A.D.; and, in the next
historical references to them, we find them high up in the Northern
Dakkan, amongst the kingdoms conquered by the Ch&#257;lukyas about the
fourth century A.D. soon after they first crossed the Nerbudda. In the
Kongu Chronicle they are stated to be of the solar race: and the
genealogies of this tribe accordingly trace them up to Kusha, the
second son of R&#257;ma, the hero of the great solar epic of the
Hindus; but their claim to this descent is not undisputed. They are,
however, sometimes said to be of the lunar race, and of the Y&#257;dava
tribe, though this latter statement is sometimes confined to the later
R&#257;thors.&rdquo; According to the Rev. T. Foulkes, the name Ratti
is found under various forms, e.g., Irattu, Iretti, Radda,
R&#257;htor, Rathaur, R&#257;shtra-k&#363;ta, Ratta, Reddi, etc.

In a note on the R&#257;shtrakutas, Mr. J. F. Fleet writes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2896src" href="#xd21e2896" name=
"xd21e2896src">106 that &ldquo;we find that, from the first
appearance of the Chalukyas in this part of the country, in the fifth
century A.D., the Kanarese districts of the Bombay Presidency were held
by them, with short periods of interruption of their power caused by
the invasions of the Pallavas and other kings, down to about the early
part or the middle of the eighth century A.D. Their sway over this part
of the country then ceased entirely for a time. This was due to an
invasion by the R&#257;shtrakuta kings, who, like their predecessors,
came from the north.... It is difficult to say when there was first a
R&#257;shtrakuta kingdom. The earliest notices that we have of the
family are contained in the western Chalukya inscriptions. Thus, the
Miraj plates tell us that Jayasimha I, restored the fortunes of the
Chalukya dynasty by defeating, among others, one Indra of the
R&#257;shtrakuta family, who was the son of Krishna, and who possessed
an army of eight hundred elephants; and there is little doubt that
&#256;pp&#257;yika-Govinda, who, as we are told in the Aihole Meguti
inscription, came from the north and invaded the Chalukya kingdom with
his troops of elephants, and was repulsed by Pulikesi II, also belonged
to this same dynasty. It is plain, therefore, that in the fifth and
sixth centuries A.D. the R&#257;shtrakuta dynasty was one of
considerable importance in central or in northern India. The later
inscriptions state that the R&#257;shtrakutas were of the Somavamsa or
lunar race, and were descendants of Yadu. Dr. Burnell seems inclined to
look upon the family as of Dravidian origin, as he gives
&lsquo;R&#257;shtra&rsquo; as an instance of the Sanskritising of
Dravidian names, and considers it to be a mythological <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226]perversion for &lsquo;Ratta,&rsquo; which is the
same as the Kanarese and Telugu &lsquo;Reddi.&rsquo; Dr. B&uuml;hler is
unable to record any opinion as to &lsquo;whether the R&#257;shtrakutas
were an &#256;ryan Kshatriya, i.e., R&#257;jput race, which
immigrated into the Dekkan from the north like the Chalukyas, or a
Dr&#257;vidian family which was received into the &#256;ryan community
after the conquest of the Dekkan.<span class="corr" id="xd21e2904"
title="Not in source">&rsquo; The earliest inscriptions, at any
rate, show them as coming from the north, and, whatever may be their
origin, as the word R&#257;shtrakuta is used in many inscriptions of
other dynasties as the equivalent of R&#257;shtrapati, i.e., as
an official word meaning &lsquo;the headman or governor of a country or
district,&rsquo; it appears to me that the selection of it as a
dynastic name implies that, prior to attaining independent sovereignty,
the R&#257;shtrakutas were feudal chiefs under some previous dynasty,
of which they have not preserved any record.&rdquo;
It is a common saying among the K&#257;pus that they can easily
enumerate all the varieties of rice, but it is impossible to give the
names of all the sections into which the caste is split up. Some say
that there are only fourteen of these, and use the phrase Panta
padn&#257;lagu kul&#257;lu, or Panta and fourteen sections.
The following sub-divisions are recorded by Mr. Stuart<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2914src" href="#xd21e2914" name=
"xd21e2914src">107 as being the most important:&mdash;
Ay&#333;dhya, or Oudh, where R&#257;ma is reputed to have lived. The
sub-division is found in Madura and Tinnevelly. They are very proud of
their supposed connection with Oudh. At the commencement of the
marriage ceremony, the bride&rsquo;s party asks the bridegroom&rsquo;s
who they are, and the answer is that they are Ay&#333;dhya Reddis. A
similar question is then asked by [<a id="pb227"
href="#pb227" name="pb227">227]the bridegroom&rsquo;s party,
and the bride&rsquo;s friends reply that they are Mithila Reddis.
Balija. The chief Telugu trading caste. Many of the Balijas are now
engaged in cultivation, and this accounts for so many having returned
K&#257;pu as their main caste, for K&#257;pu is a common Telugu word
for a ryot or cultivator. It is not improbable that there was once a
closer connection than now between the K&#257;pus and Balijas.
Bh&#363;manchi (good earth).
D&#275;s&#363;r. Possibly residents originally of a place called
D&#275;s&#363;r, though some derive the word from d&#275;ha, body, and
s&#363;ra, valour, saying that they were renowned for their
courage.
Gandi Kottai. Found in Madura and Tinnevelly. Named after Gandi
K&#333;ta in the Ceded districts, whence they are said to have
emigrated southward.
G&#257;zula (glass bangle makers). A sub-division of the Balijas.
They are said to have two sections, called N&#257;ga (cobra) and
T&#257;b&#275;lu (tortoise), and, in some places, to keep their women
g&#333;sha.
Kammapuri. These seem to be Kammas, who, in some places, pass as
K&#257;pus. Some Kammas, for example, who have settled in the city of
Madras, call themselves K&#257;pu or Reddi.
Morasa. A sub-division of the Vakkaligas. The Verala icche
K&#257;pulu, or K&#257;pus who give the fingers, have a custom which
requires that, when a grandchild is born in a family, the wife of the
eldest son of the grandfather must have the last two joints of the
third and fourth fingers of her right hand amputated at a temple of
Bhairava.
Nerati, Nervati, or Neradu. Most numerous in Kurnool, and the Ceded
districts. [<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228]
Oraganti. Said to have formerly worked in the salt-pans. The name is
possibly a corruption of Warangal, capital of the Prat&#257;pa
Rudra.
P&#257;kan&#257;ti. Those who come from the eastern country
(pr&#257;k n&#257;du).
Palle. In some places, the Pallis who have settled in the Telugu
country call themselves Palle K&#257;pulu, and give as their g&#333;tra
Jambum&#257;ha Rishi, which is the g&#333;tra of the Pallis. Though
they do not intermarry with the K&#257;pus, the Palle K&#257;pulu may
interdine with them.
Panta (Panta, a crop). The largest sub-division of all.
Pedaganti or Pedakanti. By some said to be named after a place
called Pedagallu. By others the word is said to be derived from peda,
turned aside, and kamma eye, indicating one who turns his eyes away
from the person who speaks to him. Another suggestion is that it means
stiff-necked. The Pedakantis are said to be known by their
arrogance.
The following legend is narrated in the Baramahal Records.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2954src" href="#xd21e2954" name=
"xd21e2954src">108 &ldquo;On a time, the Guru or Patriarch came
near a village, and put up in a neighbouring grove until he sent in a
D&#257;sari to apprize his sectaries of his approach. The D&#257;sari
called at the house of one of them, and announced the arrival of the
Guru, but the master of the house took no notice of him, and, to avoid
the Guru, he ran away through the back door of the house, which is
called peradu, and by chance came to the grove, and was obliged to pay
his respects to the Guru, who asked if he had seen his D&#257;sari, and
he answered that he had been all day from home. On which, the Guru sent
for the D&#257;sari, and demanded the [<a id=
"pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229]reason of his staying
away so long, when he saw the master of the house was not in it. The
D&#257;sari replied that the person was at home when he went there, but
that, on seeing him, he fled through the back door, which the Guru
finding true, he surnamed him the Peratiguntavaru or the runaway
through the back door, now corruptly called Perdagantuwaru, and said
that he would never honour him with another visit, and that he and his
descendants should henceforth have no Guru or Patriarch.&rdquo;
P&#333;kan&#257;du (p&#333;ka, areca palm: Areca
Catechu).
Velan&#257;ti. K&#257;pus from a foreign (veli) country.
Yerlam.
&ldquo;The last division,&rdquo; Mr. Stuart writes, &ldquo;are the
most peculiar of all, and are partly of Br&#257;hmanical descent. The
story goes that a Br&#257;hman girl named Yerlamma, not having been
married by her parents in childhood, as she should have been, was for
that reason turned out of her caste. A K&#257;pu, or some say a Besta
man, took compassion on her, and to him she bore many children, the
ancestors of the Yerlam K&#257;pu caste. In consequence of the harsh
treatment of Yerlamma by her parents and caste people, all her
descendants hate Br&#257;hmans with a deadly hatred, and look down upon
them, affecting also to be superior to every other caste. They are most
exclusive, refusing to eat with any caste whatever, or even to take
chunam (lime for chewing with betel) from any but their own people,
whereas Br&#257;hmans will take lime from a S&#363;dra, provided a
little curd be mixed with it. The Yerlam K&#257;pus do not employ
priests of the Br&#257;hman or other religious classes even for their
marriages. At these no h&#333;mam (sacred fire) ceremony is performed,
and no worship offered to Vign&#275;swara, but they simply ascertain a
fortunate day [<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230]and hour, and get an old matron (sumangali) to
tie the t&#257;li to the bride&rsquo;s neck, after which there is
feasting and merry-making.&rdquo;
The Panta K&#257;pus are said to be divided into two tegas or
endogamous divisions, viz., Peram&#257; Reddi or Muduru K&#257;pu (ripe
or old K&#257;pu); and K&#257;tama Reddi or Letha K&#257;pu (young or
unripe K&#257;pus). A sub-division called Konda (hill) K&#257;pus is
mentioned by the Rev. J. Cain <a class="noteref" id="xd21e2974src"
href="#xd21e2974" name="xd21e2974src">109 as being engaged in
cultivation and the timber trade in the eastern gh&#257;ts near the
God&#257;vari river (see Konda Dora). &#256;kula (betel-leaf
seller) was returned at the census, 1901, as a sub-caste of
K&#257;pus.
In the Census Report, 1891, K&#257;pu (indicating cultivator), is
given as a sub-division of Chakkiliyans, Dommaras, Gadabas, Savaras and
T&#275;lis. It further occurs as a sub-division of Mangala. Some
Mar&#257;tha cultivators in the Telugu country are known as Ar&#275;
K&#257;pu. The Konda Doras are also called Konda K&#257;pus. In the
Census Report, 1901, Pandu is returned as a Tamil synonym, and
K&#257;mpo as an Oriya form of K&#257;pu.
Reddi is the usual title of the K&#257;pus, and is the title by
which the village munsiff is called in the Telugu country, regardless
of the caste to which he may belong. Reddi also occurs as a
sub-division of cultivating Linga Balijas, Telugu Vadukans or Vadugans
in the Tamil country, Velamas, and Y&#257;n&#257;dis. It is further
given as a name for Kavarais engaged in agriculture, and as a title of
the Kallangi sub-division of Pallis, and S&#257;dars. The name Sambuni
Reddi is adopted by some Palles engaged as fishermen.
As examples of exogamous septs among the K&#257;pus, the following
may be cited:&mdash; [<a id="pb231" href="#pb231"
name="pb231">231]




Avula, cow.
Alla, grain.
Bandi, cart.
Barrelu, buffaloes.
Dandu, army.
Gorre, sheep.
Gudise, hut.
Guntaka, harrow.
K&#333;dla, fowl.




M&#275;kala, goats.
K&#257;nugala, Pongamia glabra.
Mung&#257;ru, woman&rsquo;s skirt.
N&#257;gali, plough.
Tang&#275;du, Cassia auriculata.
Udumala, Varanus bengalensis.
Varige, Setaria italica.
Yeddulu, bulls.
Y&#275;nuga, elephant.




At Conjeeveram, some Panta Reddis have true totemistic septs, of
which the following are examples:&mdash;

Magili (Pandanus fascicularis).
Women do not, like women of other castes, use the flower-bracts for the
purpose of adorning themselves. A man has been known to refuse to
purchase some bamboo mats, because they were tied with the fibre of
this tree.
Ippi (Bassia longifolia). The tree, and its
products, must not be touched.
Mancham (cot). They avoid sleeping on cots.
Arigala (Paspalum scrobiculatum). The grain
is not used as food.
Chintaginjalu (tamarind seeds). The seeds may not be touched, or
used.
Puccha (Citrullus vulgaris; water melon). The
fruit may not be eaten.

The Pichigunta vandlu, a class of mendicants who beg chiefly from
K&#257;pus and Gollas, manufacture pedigrees and g&#333;tras for these
castes and the Kammas.
Concerning the origin of the K&#257;pus, the following legend is
current. During the reign of Prat&#257;pa Rudra, the wife of one Belthi
Reddi secured by severe penance a brilliant ear ornament (kamma) from
the sun. This was stolen by the King&rsquo;s minister, as the King was
very anxious to secure it for his wife. Belthi Reddi&rsquo;s wife told
her sons to recover it, but her eldest son refused to have anything to
do with the matter, as the King was involved in it. The second son
likewise refused, [<a id="pb232" href="#pb232"
name="pb232">232]and used foul language. The third son
promised to secure it, and, hearing this, one of his brothers ran away.
Finally the ornament was recovered by the youngest son. The Panta
K&#257;pus are said to be descended from the eldest son, the
P&#257;kan&#257;tis from the second, the Velamas from the son who ran
away, and the Kammas from the son who secured the jewel.
<img src=
"images/pl3-232.jpg" alt="Panta K&#257;pu." width="522" height="720">
Panta K&#257;pu.

The K&#257;pus are said to have originally dwelt in Ay&#333;dhya.
During the reign of Bharata, one Pillala Mari Belthi Reddi and his sons
deceived the King by appropriating all the grain to themselves, and
giving him the straw. The fraud was detected by R&#257;ma when he
assumed charge of the kingdom, and, as a punishment, he ordered the
K&#257;pus to bring Cucurbita (pumpkin) fruits for the
sr&#257;dh (death ceremony) of Dasar&#257;tha. They accordingly
cultivated the plant, but, before the ceremony took place, all the
plants were uprooted by Hanum&#257;n, and no fruits were forthcoming.
In lieu thereof, they promised to offer gold equal in weight to that of
the pumpkin, and brought all of which they were possessed. This they
placed in the scales, but it was not sufficient to counterbalance a
pumpkin against which it was weighed. To make up the deficiency in
weight, the K&#257;pu women removed their bottus (marriage badges), and
placed them in the scales. Since that time women of the
M&#333;t&#257;ti and Pedakanti sections have substituted a cotton
string dyed with turmeric for the bottu. It is worthy of notice that a
similar legend is current among the Vakkaligas (cultivators) of Mysore,
who, instead of giving up the bottu, seem to have abandoned the
cultivation of the Cucurbita plant. The exposure of the fraud
led Belthi Reddi to leave Ay&#333;dhya with one of his wives and
seventy-seven children, leaving behind thirteen wives. In the course of
their journey, they had [<a id="pb233" href=
"#pb233" name="pb233">233]to cross the Sil&#257;nadi
(petrifying river), and, if they passed through the water, they would
have become petrified. So they went to a place called Dhonakonda, and,
after worshipping Ganga, the head of the idol was cut off, and brought
to the river bank. The waters, like those of the Red Sea in the time of
Pharaoh, were divided, and the K&#257;pus crossed on dry ground. In
commemoration of this event, the K&#257;pus still worship Ganga during
their marriage ceremonies. After crossing the river, the travellers
came to the temple of Mallikarjuna, and helped the Jangams in the
duties of looking after it. Some time afterwards the Jangams left the
place for a time, and placed the temple in charge of the K&#257;pus. On
their return, the K&#257;pus refused to hand over charge to them, and
it was decided that whoever should go to N&#257;gal&#333;kam (the abode
of snakes), and bring back N&#257;ga Malligai (jasmine from
snake-land), should be considered the rightful owner of the temple. The
Jangams, who were skilled in the art of transformation, leaving their
mortal frames, went in search of the flower in the guise of spirits.
Taking advantage of this, the K&#257;pus burnt the bodies of the
Jangams, and, when the spirits returned, there were no bodies for them
to enter. Thereon the god of the temple became angry, and transformed
the Jangams into crows, which attacked the K&#257;pus, who fled to the
country of Oraganti Prat&#257;pa Rudra. As this King was a Sakti
worshipper, the crows ceased to harass the K&#257;pus, who settled down
as cultivators. Of the produce of the land, nine-tenths were to be
given to the King, and the K&#257;pus were to keep a tithe. At this
time the wife of Belthi Reddi was pregnant, and she asked her sons what
they would give to the son who was about to be born. They all promised
to give him half their earnings. The child grew into a learned man and
poet, and one day carried [<a id="pb234" href=
"#pb234" name="pb234">234]water to the field where his
brothers were at work. The vessel containing the water was only a small
one, and there was not enough water for all. But he prayed to
Sarasvati, with whose aid the vessel was always filled up. Towards
evening, the grain collected during the day was heaped together, with a
view to setting apart the share for the King. But a dispute arose among
the brothers, and it was decided that only a tithe should be given to
him. The King, being annoyed with the K&#257;pus for not giving him his
proper share, waited for an opportunity to bring disgrace on Belthi
Reddi, and sought the assistance of a Jangam, who managed to become the
servant of Belthi Reddi&rsquo;s wife. After some time, he picked up her
kamma when it fell off while she was asleep, and handed it over to
Prat&#257;pa Rudra, who caused it to be proclaimed that he had secured
the ornament as a preliminary to securing the person of its owner. The
eldest son of Belthi Reddi, however, recovered the kamma in a fight
with the King, during which he carried his youngest brother on his
back. From him the Kammas are descended. The Velamas are descended from
the sons who ran away, and the K&#257;pus from those who would neither
fight nor run away.
Pollution at the first menstrual ceremony lasts, I am informed, for
sixteen days. Every day, both morning and evening, a dose of gingelly
(Sesamum) oil is administered to the girl, and, if it produces
much purging, she is treated with buffalo gh&#299; (clarified butter).
On alternate days water is poured over her head, and from the neck
downwards. The cloth which she wears, whether new or old, becomes the
property of the washerwoman. On the first day the meals consist of milk
and dh&#257;l (Cajanus indicus), but on subsequent days cakes,
etc., are allowed. [<a id="pb235" href="#pb235"
name="pb235">235]
In their marriage ceremonial, the Panta Reddis of the South Arcot
and Salem districts appear to follow the Br&#257;hmanical form. In the
Telugu country, however, it is as follows. On the pradh&#257;nam or
betrothal day, the party of the bridegroom-elect go in procession under
a canopy (ulladam), attended by musicians, and matrons carrying betel,
cocoanuts, date and plantain fruits, and turmeric on plates. As soon as
they have arrived at the courtyard of the future bride&rsquo;s house,
she seats herself on a plank. A Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit moulds a
little turmeric paste into a conical mass representing Vign&#275;swara
(the elephant god), and it is worshipped by the girl, in front of whom
the trays brought by the women are placed. She is presented with a new
cloth, which she puts on, and a near female relation gives her three
handfuls of areca nuts, a few betel leaves, and the bride-price and
jewels tied up in a turmeric-dyed cloth. All these things the girl
deposits in her lap. The fathers of the contracting couple then
exchange betel, with the customary formula. &ldquo;The girl is yours,
and the money mine&rdquo; and &ldquo;The money is yours, and the girl
mine.&rdquo; Early on the wedding morning the bridegroom&rsquo;s party,
accompanied by a pur&#333;hit and washerman (Ts&#257;kala), go to fetch
the bride from her house. The milk-post is set up, and is usually made
of a branch of Mimusops hexandra or, in the Tamil country,
Odina Wodier. On the conclusion of the marriage rites, the
Odina post is planted in the backyard, and, if it takes root and
flourishes, it is regarded as a happy omen for the newly married
couple. A small party of K&#257;pus, taking with them some food and
gingelly (Sesamum) oil, proceed in procession beneath a canopy
to the house of a washerman (Ts&#257;kala), in order to obtain from him
a framework made of bamboo or sticks over which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236]cotton threads are wound (dhornam), and the
Ganga idol, which is kept in his custody. The food is presented to him,
and some rice poured into his cloth. Receiving these things, he says
that he cannot find the dhornam and idol without a torch-light, and
demands gingelly oil. This is given to him, and the K&#257;pus return
with the washerman carrying the dhornam and idol to the marriage house.
When they arrive at the entrance thereto, red coloured food, coloured
water (&#257;rathi) and incense are waved before the idol, which is
taken into a room, and placed on a settle of rice. The washerman is
then asked to tie the dhornam to the pandal (marriage booth) or roof of
the house, and he demands some paddy, which is heaped up on the ground.
Standing thereon, he ties the dhornam. The people next proceed to the
houses of the goldsmith and potter, and bring back the bottu (marriage
badge) and thirteen marriage pots, on which threads (kankanam) are tied
before they are removed. A Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit ties the thread
round one pot, and the K&#257;pus round the rest. The pots are placed
in the room along with the Ganga idol. The bottu is tied round the neck
of a married woman who is closely related to the bridegroom. The
contracting couple are seated with the ends of their clothes tied
together. A barber comes with a cup of water, and a tray containing
rice dyed with turmeric is placed on the floor. A number of men and
women then scatter rice over the heads of the bride and bridegroom,
and, after, waving a silver or copper coin in front of them, throw it
into the barber&rsquo;s cup. The barber then pares the finger and toe
nails of the bridegroom, and touches the toe nails of the bride with
his razor. They then go through the nalagu ceremony, being smeared with
oil and Phaseolus Mungo paste, and bathe. After the bath
[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237]the bridegroom, dressed in his wedding finery,
proceeds to the temple. As he leaves the house, a M&#257;diga hands him
a pair of shoes, which he puts on. The M&#257;diga is given food placed
in a basket on eleven leaves. At the temple worship is performed, and a
Bhatr&#257;zu (bard and panegyrist), who has accompanied the
bridegroom, ties a b&#257;shingham (chaplet) on his forehead. From this
moment the Bhatr&#257;zu must remain with the bridegroom, as his
personal attendant, painting the sectarian marks on his forehead, and
carrying out other functions. In like manner, a Bh&#333;gam woman
(dedicated prostitute) waits on the bride. &ldquo;The tradition,&rdquo;
Mr. Stuart writes, &ldquo;is that the Bhatr&#257;zus were a northern
caste, which was first invited south by king Prat&#257;pa Rudra of the
Kshatriya dynasty of Warrangal (1295&ndash;1323 A.D.). After the
downfall of that kingdom they seem to have become court bards and
panegyrists under the Reddi and Velama feudal chiefs.&rdquo; From the
temple the bridegroom and his party come to the marriage pandal, and,
after food and other things have been waved to avert the evil eye, he
enters the house. On the threshold his brother-in-law washes his feet,
and sits thereon till he has extracted some money or a cow as a
present. The bridegroom then goes to the marriage dais, whither the
bride is conducted, and stands facing him, with a screen interposed
between them. Vign&#275;swara is worshipped, and the wrist threads
(kankanam) are tied on, the bridegroom placing his right foot on the
left foot of the bride. The bottu is removed from the neck of the
married woman, passed round to be blessed, and tied by the bridegroom
on the bride&rsquo;s neck. The bride is lifted up by her maternal
uncle, and the couple sprinkle each other with rice. The screen is
removed, and they sit side by side with the ends of their cloths tied
together. Rice is [<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238]thrown over them by those assembled, and
they are made to gaze at the pole star (Arundati). The proceedings
terminate by the pair searching for a finger-ring and pap-bowl in one
of the pots filled with water. On the second day there is feasting, and
the nalagu ceremony is again performed. On the following day, the
bridegroom and his party pretend to take offence at some thing which is
done by the bride&rsquo;s people, who follow them with presents, and a
reconciliation is speedily effected. Towards evening, a ceremony called
n&#257;gavali, or sacrifice to the D&#275;vatas, is performed. The
bridal pair, with the Bhatr&#257;zu and Bh&#333;gam woman, occupy the
dais. The Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit places on a tray a conical mass of
turmeric representing Vign&#275;swara, to whom p&#363;ja (worship) is
done. He then places a brass vessel (kalasam) filled with water, and
with its mouth closed by a cocoanut, on a settle of rice spread on a
tray. The kalasam is worshipped as representing the D&#275;vatas. The
Br&#257;hman invokes the blessing of all the Gods and D&#275;vatas,
saying &ldquo;Let Siva bless the pair,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let Indra bless
the pair,&rdquo; etc. A near relative of the bridegroom sits by the
side of the pur&#333;hit with plenty of betel leaves and areca nuts.
After each God or D&#275;vata has been mentioned, he throws some of the
nuts and leaves into a tray, and, as these are the perquisites of the
pur&#333;hit, he may repeat the same name three or four times. The
K&#257;pu then makes playful remarks about the greed of the
pur&#333;hit, and, amid much laughter, refuses to put any more leaves
or nuts in the tray. This ceremonial concluded, the near relations of
the bridegroom stand in front of him, and, with hands crossed, hold
over his head two brass plates, into which a small quantity of milk is
poured. Fruit, betel leaves and areca nuts (p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri) are
next distributed in a recognised order of [<a id=
"pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239]precedence. The first
presentation is made to the house god, the second to the family priest,
and the third to the Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit. If a P&#257;kan&#257;ti
K&#257;pu is present, he must receive his share immediately after the
Br&#257;hman, and before other K&#257;pus, Kammas, and others. Before
it is presented to each person, the leaves and nuts are touched by the
bridegroom, and the hand of the bride is placed on them by the
Bh&#333;gam woman. At a Panta K&#257;pu wedding, the Ganga idol,
together with a goat and a k&#257;vadi (bamboo pole with baskets of
rice, cakes, betel leaves and areca nuts), is carried in procession to
a pond or temple. The washerman, dressed up as a woman, heads the
procession, and keeps on dancing and singing till the destination is
reached. The idol is placed inside a rude triangular hut made of three
sheaves of straw, and the articles brought in the baskets are spread
before it. On the heap of rice small lumps of flour paste are placed,
and these are made into lights by scooping out cavities, and feeding
the wicks with gh&#299; (clarified butter). One of the ears of the goat
is then cut, and it is brought near the food. This done, the lights are
extinguished, and the assembly returns home without the least noise.
The washerman takes charge of the idol, and goes his way. If the
wedding is spread over five days, the Ganga idol is removed on the
fourth day, and the customary mock-ploughing ceremony performed on the
fifth. The marriage ceremonies close with the removal of the threads
from the wrists of the newly married couple. Among the Panta Reddis of
the Tamil country, the Ganga idol is taken in procession by the
washerman two or three days before the marriage, and he goes to every
Reddi house, and receives a present of money. The idol is then set up
in the verandah, and worshipped daily till the conclusion of the
marriage ceremonies. &ldquo;Among [<a id="pb240"
href="#pb240" name="pb240">240]the Reddis of
Tinnevelly,&rdquo; Dr. J. Shortt writes, &ldquo;a young woman of
sixteen or twenty years of age is frequently married to a boy of five
or six years, or even of a more tender age. After marriage she, the
wife, lives with some other man, a near relative on the maternal side,
frequently an uncle, and sometimes with the boy-husband&rsquo;s own
father. The progeny so begotten are affiliated on the boy-husband. When
he comes of age, he finds his wife an old woman, and perhaps past
child-bearing. So he, in his turn, contracts a liaison with some
other boy&rsquo;s wife, and procreates children.&rdquo; The custom has
doubtless been adopted in imitation of the Maravans, Kallans,
Agamudaiyans, and other castes, among whom the Reddis have settled. In
an account of the Ay&#333;dhya Reddis of Tinnevelly, Mr. Stuart writes
that it is stated that &ldquo;the t&#257;li is peculiar, consisting of
a number of cotton threads besmeared with turmeric, without any gold
ornament. They have a proverb that he who went forth to procure a
t&#257;li and a cloth never returned.&rdquo; This proverb is based on
the following legend. In days of yore a Reddi chief was about to be
married, and he accordingly sent for a goldsmith, and, desiring him to
make a splendid t&#257;li, gave him the price of it in advance. The
smith was a drunkard, and neglected his work. The day for the
celebration of the marriage arrived, but there was no t&#257;li.
Whereupon the old chief, plucking a few threads from his garment,
twisted them into a cord, and tied it round the neck of the bride, and
this became a custom.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3132src" href=

K&#257;pu Bride and Bridegroom.

In the Census Report, 1891, Mr. Stuart states that he was informed
that polyandry of the fraternal type exists among the Panta K&#257;pus,
but the statement [<a id="pb241" href="#pb241"
name="pb241">241]requires verification. I am unable to
discover any trace of this custom, and it appears that Reddi
Y&#257;n&#257;dis are employed by Panta Reddis as domestic servants. If
a Reddi Y&#257;n&#257;di&rsquo;s husband dies, abandons, or divorces
his wife, she may marry his brother. And, in the case of separation or
divorce, the two brothers will live on friendly terms with each
other.
In the Indian Law Reports<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3146src" href=
"#xd21e3146" name="xd21e3146src">111 it is noted that the custom of
illatom,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3149src" href="#xd21e3149" name=
"xd21e3149src">112 or affiliation of a son-in-law, obtains among
the M&#333;t&#257;ti K&#257;pus in Bellary and Kurnool, and the Pedda
K&#257;pus in Nellore. He who has at the time no son, although he may
have more than one daughter, and whether or not he is hopeless of
having male issue, may exercise the right of taking an illatom
son-in-law. For the purposes of succession this son-in-law stands in
the place of a son, and, in competition with natural-born sons, takes
an equal share.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3152src" href="#xd21e3152"
name="xd21e3152src">113
According to the Kurnool Manual (1886), &ldquo;the Pakan&#257;dus of
Pattikonda and R&#257;mallak&#333;ta t&#257;luks allow a widow to take
a second husband from among the caste-men. She can wear no signs of
marriage, such as the t&#257;li, glass bangles, and the like, but she
as well as her husband is allowed to associate with the other caste-men
on equal terms. Their progeny inherit their father&rsquo;s property
equally with children born in regular wedlock, but they generally
intermarry with persons similarly circumstanced. Their marriage with
the issue of a regularly married couple is, however, not prohibited. It
is matter for regret that this privilege of remarrying is <span class=
"pagenum">[242]much
abused, as among the Linga Balijas. Not unfrequently it extends to
pregnant widows also, and so widows live in adultery with a caste-man
without fear of excommunication, encouraged by the hope of getting
herself united to him or some other caste-man in the event of
pregnancy. In many cases, caste-men are hired for the purpose of going
through the forms of marriage simply to relieve such widows from the
penalty of excommunication from caste. The man so hired plays the part
of husband for a few days, and then goes away in accordance with his
secret contract.&rdquo; The abuse of widow marriage here referred to is
said to be uncommon, though it is sometimes practiced among K&#257;pus
and other castes in out-of-the-way villages. It is further noted in the
Kurnool Manual that Pedakanti K&#257;pu women do not wear the
t&#257;li, or a bodice (ravika) to cover their breasts. And the
tight-fitting bodice is said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3162src" href=
"#xd21e3162" name="xd21e3162src">114 to be &ldquo;far less
universal in Anantapur than Bellary, and, among some castes
(e.g., certain sub-divisions of the K&#257;pus and &#298;digas),
it is not worn after the first confinement.&rdquo;
In the disposal of their dead, the rites among the K&#257;pus of the
Telugu country are very similar to those of the Kammas and Balijas. The
Panta Reddis of the Tamil country, however, follow the ceremonial in
vogue among various Tamil castes. The news of a death in the community
is conveyed by a Paraiyan T&#333;ti (sweeper). The dead man&rsquo;s son
receives a measure containing a light from a barber, and goes three
times round the corpse. At the burning-ground the barber, instead of
the son, goes thrice round the corpse, carrying a pot containing water,
and followed by the son, who makes [<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243]holes therein. The stream of
water which trickles out is sprinkled over the corpse. The barber then
breaks the pot into very small fragments. If the fragments were large,
water might collect in them, and be drunk by birds, which would bring
sickness (pakshidh&#333;sham) on children, over whose heads they might
pass. On the day after the funeral, a Panisavan or barber extinguishes
the fire, and collects the ashes together. A washerman brings a basket
containing various articles required for worship, and, after p&#363;ja
has been performed, a plant of Leucas aspera is placed on the
ashes. The bones are collected in a new pot, and thrown into a river,
or consigned by parcel-post to an agent at Benares, and thrown into the
Ganges.
By religion the K&#257;pus are both Vaishnavites and Saivites, and
they worship a variety of deities, such as Th&#257;llamma,
N&#257;garapamma, Putlamma, Ankamma, Mun&#275;swara, P&#333;leramma,
D&#275;samma. To Mun&#275;swara and D&#275;samma pongal (cooked rice)
is offered, and buffaloes are sacrificed to P&#333;leramma. Even
M&#257;tangi, the goddess of the M&#257;digas, is worshipped by some
K&#257;pus. At purificatory ceremonies a M&#257;diga Basavi woman,
called M&#257;tangi, is sent for, and cleanses the house or its inmates
from pollution by sprinkling and spitting out toddy.
From an interesting note<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3179src" href=
"#xd21e3179" name="xd21e3179src">115 on agricultural ceremonies in
the Bellary district, the following extract is taken. &ldquo;On the
first full-moon day in the month of Bh&#257;drapada (September), the
agricultural population celebrate a feast called the Jokum&#257;ra
feast, to appease the rain-god. The B&#257;rikas (women), who are a
sub-division of the Kabb&#275;ra caste belonging to the Gaurimakkalu
section, [<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244]go round the town or village in which they live,
with a basket on their heads containing margosa (Melia
Azadirachta) leaves, flowers of various kinds, and holy ashes. They
beg alms, especially of the cultivating classes (K&#257;pus), and, in
return for the alms bestowed (usually grain and food), they give some
of the margosa leaves, flowers, and ashes. The K&#257;pus take these to
their fields, prepare cholam (millet: Sorghum) gruel, mix them
with it, and sprinkle the kanji or gruel all round their fields. After
this, the K&#257;pu proceeds to the potter&rsquo;s kiln, fetches ashes
from it, and makes a figure of a human being. This figure is placed
prominently in some convenient spot in the field, and is called
Jokum&#257;ra or rain-god. It is supposed to have the power of bringing
down the rain in proper time. The figure is sometimes small, and
sometimes big. A second kind of Jokum&#257;ra worship is called muddam,
or outlining of rude representations of human figures with powdered
charcoal. These representations are made in the early morning, before
the bustle of the day commences, on the ground at crossroads and along
thoroughfares. The B&#257;rikas who draw these figures are paid a small
remuneration in money or in kind. The figure represents Jokum&#257;ra,
who will bring down rain when insulted by people treading on him.
Another kind of Jokum&#257;ra worship also prevails in this district.
When rain fails, the K&#257;pu females model a figure of a naked human
being of small size. They place this figure in an open mock palanquin,
and go from door to door singing indecent songs, and collecting alms.
They continue this procession for three or four days, and then abandon
the figure in a field adjacent to the village. The M&#257;las then take
possession of this abandoned Jokum&#257;ra, and in their turn go about
singing indecent songs and collecting alms for three or <span class=
"pagenum">[245]four
days, and then throw it away in some jungle. This form of Jokum&#257;ra
worship is also believed to bring down plenty of rain. There is another
simple superstition among these K&#257;pu females. When rain fails, the
K&#257;pu females catch hold of a frog, and tie it alive to a new
winnowing fan made of bamboo. On this fan, leaving the frog visible,
they spread a few margosa leaves, and go singing from door to door
&lsquo;Lady frog must have her bath. Oh! rain-god, give a little water
for her at least.&rsquo; This means that the drought has reached such a
stage that there is not even a drop of water for the frogs. When the
K&#257;pu woman sings this song, the woman of the house brings a little
water in a vessel, pours it over the frog which is left on the fan
outside the door, and gives some alms. The woman of the house is
satisfied that such an action will soon bring down rain in
torrents.&rdquo;
In the K&#257;pu community, women play an important part, except in
matters connected with agriculture. This is accounted for by a story to
the effect that, when they came from Ay&#333;dhya, the K&#257;pus
brought no women with them, and sought the assistance of the gods in
providing them with wives. They were told to marry women who were the
illegitimate issue of P&#257;ndavas, and the women consented on the
understanding that they were to be given the upper hand, and that
menial service, such as husking paddy (rice), cleaning vessels, and
carrying water, should be done for them. They accordingly employ Gollas
and Gamallas, and, in the Tamil country, Pallis as domestic servants.
M&#257;las and M&#257;digas freely enter K&#257;pu houses for the
purpose of husking paddy, but are not allowed into the kitchen, or room
in which the household gods are worshipped.
In some K&#257;pu houses, bundles of ears of paddy may be seen hung
up as food for sparrows, which are held [<a id=
"pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246]in esteem. The
hopping of sparrows is said to resemble the gait of a person confined
in fetters, and there is a legend that the K&#257;pus were once in
chains, and the sparrows set them at liberty, and took the bondage on
themselves.
It has been noted<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3200src" href=
"#xd21e3200" name="xd21e3200src">116 by Mr. C. K. Subbha Rao, of
the Agricultural Department, that the Reddis and others, who migrated
southward from the Telugu country, &ldquo;occupy the major portion of
the black cotton soil of the Tamil country. There is a strange affinity
between the Telugu cultivators and black cotton soil; so much so that,
if a census was taken of the owners of such soil in the Tamil districts
of Coimbatore, Trichinopoly, Madura, and Tinnevelly, ninety per cent,
would no doubt prove to be Vadugars (northerners), or the descendants
of Telugu immigrants. So great is the attachment of the Vadugan to the
black cotton soil that the Tamilians mock him by saying that, when god
offered paradise to the Vadugan, the latter hesitated, and enquired
whether there was black cotton soil there.&rdquo;
In a note on the Pongala or P&#333;kan&#257;ti and Panta Reddis of
the Trichinopoly district, Mr. F. R. Hemingway writes as follows.
&ldquo;Both speak Telugu, but they differ from each other in their
customs, live in separate parts of the country, and will neither
intermarry nor interdine. The Reddis will not eat on equal terms with
any other S&#363;dra caste, and will accept separate meals only from
the vegetarian section of the Vell&#257;las. They are generally
cultivators, but they had formerly rather a bad reputation for crime,
and it is said that some of them are receivers of stolen property. Like
various other castes, they have beggars, called Bavani N&#257;yakkans,
[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247]attached to them, who beg from no other caste,
and whose presence is necessary when they worship their caste goddess.
The Chakkiliyans are also attached to them, and play a prominent part
in the marriages of the Panta sub-division. Formerly, a Chakkiliyan was
deputed to ascertain the status of the other party before the match was
arranged, and his dreams were considered as omens of its desirability.
He was also honoured at the marriage by being given the first betel and
nuts. Nowadays he precedes the bridegroom&rsquo;s party with a basket
of fruit, to announce its coming. A Chakkiliyan is also often deputed
to accompany a woman on a journey. The caste goddess of the Reddis is
Yellamma, whose temple is at Esanai in Perambal&#363;r, and she is
reverenced by both Pantas and Pongalas. The latter observe rather
gruesome rites, including the drinking of a kid&rsquo;s blood. The
Pantas also worship Rengayiamman and P&#333;layamman with peculiar
ceremonies. The women are the principal worshippers, and, on one of the
nights after Pongal, they unite to do reverence to these goddesses, a
part of the ritual consisting in exposing their persons. With this may
be compared the Sevvaipillayar rite celebrated in honour of Gan&#275;sa
by Vell&#257;la woman (see Vell&#257;la). Both divisions of
Reddis wear the sacred thread at funerals. Neither of them allow
divorc&eacute;es or widows to marry again. The women of the two
divisions can be easily distinguished by their appearance. The Panta
Reddis wear a characteristic gold ear-ornament called kammal, a flat
nose-ring studded with inferior rubies, and a golden wire round the
neck, on which both the t&#257;li and the pottu are tied. They are of
fairer complexion than the Pongala women. The Panta women are allowed a
great deal of freedom, which is usually ascribed to their dancing-girl
origin, and are said to rule [<a id="pb248" href=
"#pb248" name="pb248">248]their husbands in a manner rare in
other castes. They are often called d&#275;vadiya (dancing-girl)
Reddis, and it is said that, though the men of the caste receive
hospitality from the Reddis of the north country, their women are not
invited. Their chastity is said to be frail, and their lapses easily
condoned by their husbands. The Pongalas are equally lax about their
wives, but are said to rigorously expel girls or widows who misconduct
themselves, and their seducers as well. However, the Panta men and
women treat each other with a courtesy that is probably to be found in
no other caste, rising and saluting each other, whatever their
respective ages, whenever they meet. The purification ceremony for a
house defiled by the unchastity of a maid or widow is rather an
elaborate affair. Formerly a Kolakk&#257;ran (huntsman), a Tottiyan, a
priest of the village goddess, a Chakkiliyan, and a Bavani
N&#257;yakkan had to be present. The Tottiyan is now sometimes
dispensed with. The Kolakk&#257;ran and the Bavani N&#257;yakkan burn
some k&#257;m&#257;cchi grass (Andropogon Sch&oelig;nanthus),
and put the ashes in three pots of water. The Tottiyan then worships
Pillayar (Gan&#275;sa) in the form of some turmeric, and pours the
turmeric into the water. The members of the polluted household then sit
in a circle, while the Chakkiliyan carries a black kid round the
circle. He is pursued by the Bavani N&#257;yakkan, and both together
cut off the animal&rsquo;s head, and bury it. The guilty parties have
then to tread on the place where the head is buried, and the turmeric
and ash water is poured over them. This ceremony rather resembles the
one performed by the &#362;r&#257;lis. The Pantas are said to have no
caste panch&#257;yats (council), whereas the Pongalas recognise the
authority of officers called Kambalakk&#257;rans and Kottukk&#257;rans
who uphold the discipline.&rdquo; [<a id="pb249"

daughter-in-law (i.e., both must work for him).
The Karnam (village accountant) is the cause of the
K&#257;pu&rsquo;s death.
The K&#257;pu goes not to the fort (i.e., into the presence
of the R&#257;ja). A modern variant is that the K&#257;pu goes not to
the court (of law).
While the K&#257;pu was sluggishly ploughing, thieves stole the rope
collars.
The year the K&#257;pu came in, the famine came too.
The Reddis are those who will break open the soil to fill their
bellies.
When the unpracticed Reddi got into a palanquin, it swung from side
to side.
The Reddi who had never mounted a horse sat with his face to the
tail.
The Reddi fed his dog like a horse, and barked himself.

Holeyas.
Karadi (bear).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Tottiyan.
K&#257;raikk&#257;t.&mdash;K&#257;raikk&#257;t,
K&#257;raikk&#257;tar, or K&#257;rk&#257;tta, meaning those who waited
for rain, or, according to another version, those who saved or
protected the clouds, is an endogamous division of Vell&#257;la. Some
Tamil Malay&#257;lis, who claim to be Vell&#257;las who emigrated to
the hills from Conjeeveram, have, at times of census, returned
themselves as K&#257;raikka&#257;t Vell&#257;las.

K&#257;r&#257;lan.&mdash;In the Census Report, 1891, the
K&#257;r&#257;lans (rulers of clouds) are returned as a tribe of
hunters and cultivators found in the hills of Salem and South Arcot. In
the Report, 1901, K&#257;r&#257;lan is given as a synonym for
Vell&#257;la in Malabar, and also as a name for Malay&#257;lis. At the
census, 1901, many of the Malay&#257;lis of the Shevaroy hills in the
Salem district returned themselves as Vell&#257;las and
K&#257;r&#257;lans. And the divisions returned by the
K&#257;r&#257;lans, e.g., Kolli, Pacchai, Periya, and Perianan,
connect them with these Malay&#257;lis (q.v.).
Karep&#257;ku.&mdash;Karep&#257;ku or Karuvepilai is a name
for Koravas, who hawk for sale leaves of the curry-leaf plant

Karimp&#257;lan.&mdash;The Karimp&#257;lans are a small
hunting and cultivating forest tribe in Malabar. They are &ldquo;punam
(shifting) cultivators, hewers of wood, and collectors of wild pepper,
and are found in all the foot hills north of the Camel&rsquo;s Hump.
They wear the kudumi (hair knot), and are said to follow the
marumakkat&#257;yam system of inheritance in the female line, but they
do not perform the t&#257;li kettu ceremony. They are supposed to have
the power of exorcising the demon Karuvilli, possession by whom takes
the form of fever.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3308src" href=

Karkatta.&mdash;A synonym of K&#257;raik&#257;ttu

Karnabattu.&mdash;The Karnabattus, or Karnabhatus, are a
Telugu weaving caste, found chiefly in the God&#257;vari district. The
story goes that there once lived a king, who ruled over a portion of
the country now included in this district, and was worried by a couple
of demons, who carried off some of his subjects for their daily food.
The king prayed Siva for deliverance from them, and the god, being
gratified at his devotion to him, produced nine persons from his ears,
and ordered them to slay the demons. This they did, and their
descendants are the Karnabhatus, or ear soldiers. By religion, the
Karnabattus are either ordinary Saivites or Ling&#257;yats. When a girl
reaches maturity, she remains under a pollution for sixteen days. Early
marriage is the rule, and a Br&#257;hman officiates at weddings. The
dead, as among other Lingay&#257;ts, are buried in a sitting posture.
The caste is organised in the same manner as the S&#257;l&#275;s, and,
at each place, there is a headman called Kulampedda or J&#257;tipedda,
corresponding to the S&#275;n&#257;patbi of the S&#257;l&#275;s. They
weave coarse cloths, which are inferior in texture to those
manufactured by Patta S&#257;l&#275;s and S&#299;l&#275;vantas.
In a note on the Karnabattus, Mr. F. R. Hemingway writes that
&ldquo;though a low caste, they forbid the remarriage of widows. But
the remark in the Census Report (1901) that they abstain from meat is
not true of the Karnabattus questioned, who admitted that they would
eat even pork. Their special deity is Som&#275;svara, whom they unite
to worship on the new-moon day of Pushyam [<a id=
"pb252" href="#pb252" name="pb252">252](January-February).
The god is represented by a mud idol made for the occasion. The
p&#363;j&#257;ri (priest) throws flowers over it in token of adoration,
and sits before it with his hands outstretched and his mouth closed
until one of the flowers falls into his hands.&rdquo;
The Karnabattus have no regular caste titles, but sometimes the
elders add Ayya or Anna as a suffix to their name.
Karna S&#257;l&#275;.&mdash;The Karna S&#257;l&#275;s are a
caste of Telugu weavers, who are called S&#275;niyans in the Tamil
country, e.g., at Madura and Tanjore. They seem to have no
tradition as to their origin, but the name Karna would seem to have its
origin in the legend relating to the Karnabattus. These are, in the
community, both Saivites and Vaishnavites, and all members of the
Illabaththini sept are Vaishnavites. They are said to have only one
g&#333;tra, K&#257;si (Benares), and numerous exogamous septs, of which
the following are examples:&mdash;

Vasthr&#257;la, cloth.
Rudr&#257;kshala, seeds of El&aelig;ocarpus Ganitrus.
Mandha, village common or herd.
Kodavili, sickle.
Th&#257;dla, rope.
Th&#257;tichettu, palmyra palm.
Dhoddi, court-yard.
Thippa, rubbish-heap.

In some places, the office of headman, who is called Setti, is
hereditary. He is assisted by a Pedda K&#257;pu, and Nela Setti, of
whom the latter is selected monthly, and derives his name from the
Telugu nela (month). In their marriage ceremonial, the Karna
S&#257;l&#275;s closely follow the Padma S&#257;l&#275;s, but they have
no upan&#257;yanam (sacred thread rite), or K&#257;siyathr&#275; (mock
pilgrimage to Benares), have twelve pots brought for worship, and no
pot-searching.
As among other Telugu castes, when a girl reaches puberty, twigs of
Strychnos Nux-vomica are placed in the
[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253]special hut erected for the occasion. On the
third or fifth day, the girl&rsquo;s relations come to her house under
a cloth canopy (ulladam), carrying rice soaked in jaggery (crude sugar)
water. This rice is called dhadibiyam (wet rice), and is placed in a
heap, and, after the waving of coloured water, distributed, with
p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri (betel leaves and areca nuts), among those
present.
The dead are carried to the burial-ground in a car, and buried,
after the manner of Ling&#257;yats, in a sitting posture. Jangams
officiate at funerals.
The caste deity is Som&#275;svara. Some Karna S&#257;l&#275;s wear
the lingam, but are not particular about keeping it on their person,
leaving it in the house, and wearing it when at meals, and on important
occasions. Concerning the Ling&#257;yat section of the community, Mr.
H. A. Stuart writes, as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3380src"
href="#xd21e3380" name="xd21e3380src">118 &ldquo;The Ling&#257;yats
resemble the Linga Balijas in all their customs, in all respects,
except that they recognise s&#363;takam, or pollution, and bathe to
remove it. They freely eat in the houses of all Linga Balijas, but the
latter will not eat with them. They entirely disregard the spiritual
authority of the Br&#257;hmans, recognising priests among the Linga
Balijas, Jangams, or Pand&#257;rams. In the exercise of their trade,
they are distinguished from the Kaik&#333;lans in that they sometimes
weave in silk, which the Kaik&#333;lans never do.&rdquo; Like the Padma
S&#257;l&#275;s, the Karna S&#257;l&#275;s usually only weave coarse
cotton cloths.

corruption of Karu-aruttar, which means the Annihilators, and to have
been given to the caste because they are the descendants of a garrison
of Ch&#333;la Vell&#257;las, who treacherously allowed an enemy to
enter the Tanjore fort, and annihilate the R&#257;ja and his family.
Winslow, however, says<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3437src" href=

Kaththirav&#257;ndlu (scissors people).&mdash;Concerning this
section of the criminal classes, Mr. F. S. Mullaly writes to me as
follows. &ldquo;This is purely a Nellore name for this class of
professional pick-pockets. The appellation seems to have been given to
them from the fact that they frequent fairs and festivals, and busy
railway platforms, offering knives and scissors for sale. And, when an
opportunity presents itself, they are used for cutting strings of
beads, ripping open bags, etc. Several of these light-fingered gentry
have been found with small scissors in their mouths. Most of them wear
shoes of a peculiar shape, and these form a convenient receptacle for
the scissors. Bits of broken glass (to act as knives) are frequently
found in their mouths. In different districts they are known by
different appellations, such as Donga D&#257;saris in North Arcot and
parts of Cuddapah; Golla Woddars, Donga Woddars, and Muheri Kalas in
Cuddapah, Bellary, and Kurnool; Pachupus in Kistna and God&#257;vari;
Alagiris, Ena or Thogamalai Koravas in the southern districts.
Individuals belonging to this class of thieves have been traced, since
the opening of the East Coast Railway, as far as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258]Midnapore. An important way of identifying them
is the fact that everyone of them, male and female, is branded at the
corners of the eyebrows and between the eyes in childhood, as a
safeguard against convulsions.&rdquo;
For the following additional information I am indebted to an
official of the Police department. &ldquo;I am not aware of these
people using any particular shoes. They use sandals such as are
generally worn by ryots and the lower classes. These they get by
stealing. They pick them up from houses during the daytime, when they
go from house to house on the pretence of begging, or they steal them
at nights along with other property. These sandals are made in
different fashions in different districts, and so those possessed by
Kathiras are generally of different kinds, being stolen from various
parts of the country. They have no shoes of any peculiar make, nor do
they get any made at all. Kathiras do not generally wear any shoes.
They walk and run faster with bare feet. They wear shoes when walking
through the jungle, and entrust them to one of their comrades when
walking through the open country. They sometimes throw them off when
closely pursued, and run away. In 1899, when we arrested one on the
highroad, he had with him five or six pairs of shoes of different kinds
and sizes, and he did not account satisfactorily for being in
possession of so many. I subsequently learnt that some supernumeraries
were hiding in the jungle close to the place where he was arrested.
&ldquo;About marks of branding on the face, it is not only Kathiras,
but almost all nomadic tribes who have these marks. As the gangs move
on exposed to changes of weather, the children sometimes get a disease
called sandukatlu or palakurkura. They generally get this disease from
the latter part of the first year up to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259]fifth year. The symptoms are similar to those
which children sometimes have at the time of teething. It is when
children get this disease that they are branded on the face between the
eyebrows, on the outer corners of the eyes, and sometimes on the belly.
The brand-marks on the face and corners of the eyes are circular, and
those on the belly generally horizontal. The circular brand-marks are
made with a long piece of turmeric, one end of which is burnt for the
purpose, or with an indigo-coloured cloth rolled like a pencil and
burnt at one end. The horizontal marks are made with a hot needle.
Similar brand-marks are made by some caste Hindus on their
children.&rdquo;
To Mr. P. B. Thomas I am indebted for specimens of the chaplet, made
of strips of rolled pith, worn by Kaththira women when begging, and of
the cotton bags, full of false pockets, regularly carried by both men
and women, in which they secrete the little sharp knife and other
articles constituting their usual equipment.
In his &ldquo;History of Railway thieves,&rdquo; Mr. M. Paupa Rao
Naidu, writing about the pick-pockets or Thetakars, says that
&ldquo;most of them wear shoes called chad&#257;vs, and, if the
articles stolen are very small, they put them at once into their shoes,
which form very convenient receptacles from their peculiar shape; and,
therefore, when a pick-pocket with such a shoe on is suspected of
having stolen a jewel, the shoes must be searched first, then the mouth
and the other parts of the body.&rdquo;

Katike.&mdash;The Katike or Katikilu are butchers in the
Telugu country, concerning whom it is noted, in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260]Kurnool Manual, that &ldquo;some are called
Sult&#257;ni butchers, or Hindus forcibly circumcised by the late Nabob
of Kurnool. They observe both Mussalman and Hindu customs.&rdquo; A
correspondent in the Kurnool district informs me that the butchers of
Kurnool belong to three classes, one selling beef, and the others
mutton. Of these, the first are Muhammadans, and are called G&#257;yi
Khasayi, as they deal in beef. The other two are called respectively
Sult&#257;nis and Surasus, i.e., the circumcised and
uncircumcised. Both claim to be the descendants of two brothers, and
have the following tradition concerning their origin. T&#299;pu
Sult&#257;n is said not to have relished the idea of taking mutton at
the hands of Hindus, as they would not perform Bismallah at the time of
slaughtering the sheep. He accordingly ordered both the brothers to
appear before him. Being the manager of the family, the elder went, and
was forcibly circumcised. On hearing the news, the younger brother
absconded. The descendants of the former are Muhammadans, and of the
latter Hindus. As he was made a Muhammadan by force, the elder brother
and his descendants did not adopt all the Muhammadan manners and
customs. Till recently they did not even allow their beards to grow. At
the present day, they go to mosques, dress like Muhammadans, shave
their heads, and grow beards, but do not intermarry with the true
Muhammadans. The descendants of the younger brother still call
themselves &#256;ri-katikelu, or Mar&#257;tha butchers, profess the
Hindu religion, and follow Hindu manners and customs. Though they do
not eat with Muhammadans or Sult&#257;nis, their Hindu brethren shun
them because of their profession, and their intimacy with
Sult&#257;nis. I am informed that, at Nandyal in the Kurnool district,
some Mar&#257;tha butchers, who observe [<a id=
"pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261]purely Hindu customs,
are called by Muhammadan names. The Tahsildar of the Sirvel t&#257;luk
in the same district states that, prior to the reign of the father of
Ghulam Rasul Kh&#257;n, the dethroned Naw&#257;b of Kurnool, the
butcher&rsquo;s profession was solely in the hands of the
Mar&#257;thas, some of whom were, as stated in the Manual, forcibly
circumcised, and became a separate butcher caste, called Sult&#257;ni.
There are two sections among these Sult&#257;ni butchers, viz., Bakra
(mutton) and Gai Kasai (beef butcher). Similar stories of forcible
conversion to the Muhammadan religion are prevalent in the Bellary
district, where the Kas&#257;yis are mostly converted Hindus, who dress
in the Hindu style, but possess Muhammadan names with Hindu
terminations, e.g., Hussainappa.
In connection with butchers, I may quote the following extract from
a petition to the Governor of Madras on the subject of a strike among
the Madras butchers in 1907. &ldquo;We, the residents of Madras, beg
respectfully to bring to your Excellency&rsquo;s notice the
inconvenience and hardship we are suffering owing to the strike of the
butchers in the city. The total failure of the supply of mutton, which
is an important item in the diet of non-Br&#257;hmin Hindus,
Muhammadans, Indian Christians, Parsis, Eurasians and Europeans, causes
a deprivation not merely of something to which people have become
accustomed, but of an article of food by which the health of many is
sustained, and the want of which is calculated to impair their health,
and expose them to diseases, against which they have hitherto
successfully contended.&rdquo;

Kavarai.&mdash;Kavarai is the name for Balijas (Telugu
trading caste), who have settled in the Tamil country. The name is said
to be a corrupt form of Kauravar or Gauravar, descendants of Kuroo of
the Mah&#257;baratha, or to be the equivalent of Gauravalu, sons of
Gauri, the wife of Siva. Other suggested derivatives are: (a) a
corrupt form of the Sanskrit Kvaryku, badness or reproach, and Arya,
i.e., deteriorated Aryans; (b) Sanskrit Kavara, mixed, or
Kavaraha, a braid of hair, i.e., a mixed class, as many of the
Telugu professional prostitutes belong to this caste; (c)
Kavarai or Gavaras, buyers or dealers in cattle.
The Kavarais call themselves Balijas, and derive the name from bali,
fire, jaha sprung, i.e., men sprung from fire. Like other Telugu
castes, they have exogamous septs, e.g., tup&#257;ki (gun),

The Kavarais of Sr&#299;villiputt&#363;r, in the Tinnevelly
district, are believed to be the descendants of a few families, which
emigrated thither from Manjakuppam (Cuddalore) along with one Dora
Krishnamma N&#257;yudu. About the time of Tirumal N&#257;yak, one
R&#257;masw&#257;mi [<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264]R&#257;ju, who had five sons, of whom the
youngest was Dora Krishnamma, was reigning near Manjakuppam. Dora
Krishnamma, who was of wandering habits, having received some money
from his mother, went to Trichinopoly, and, when he was seated in the
main bazar, an elephant rushed into the street. The beast was stopped
in its career, and tamed by Dora Krishnamma, to escort whom to his
palace Vijayaranga Chokkappa sent his retinue and ministers. While they
were engaged in conversation, news arrived that some chiefs in the
Tinnevelly district refused to pay their taxes, and Dora Krishnamma
volunteered to go and subdue them. Near Sr&#299;villiputt&#363;r he
passed a ruined temple dedicated to Krishna, which he thought of
rebuilding if he should succeed in subduing the chiefs. When he reached
Tinnevelly, they, without raising any objection, paid their dues, and
Dora Krishnamma returned to Sr&#299;villiputt&#363;r, and settled
there.
Their marriage ceremonies are based on the type common to many
Telugu castes, but those who belong to the S&#299;maneli sept, and
believe themselves to be direct descendants of Krishnamma, have two
special forms of ceremonial, viz., Krishnamma p&#275;rant&#257;lu, and
the carrying of pots (gurigelu) on the heads of the bride and
bridegroom when they go to the temple before the K&#257;siyatra
ceremony. The Krishnamma p&#275;rant&#257;lu is performed on the day
prior to the muh&#363;rtam (t&#257;li-tying), and consists in the
worship of the soul of Krishnamma, a married woman. A new cloth is
purchased and presented to a married woman, together with money, betel,
etc., and she is fed before the rest. It is practically a form of
sr&#257;dh ceremony, and all the formalities of the sr&#257;dh, except
the h&#333;mam (sacred fire) and repeating of mantras from the
V&#275;das, are gone through. This is very commonly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265]observed by Br&#257;hmans, and a few castes
which engage a Br&#257;hman priest for their ceremonies. The main idea
is the propitiation of the soul of the dead married woman. If such a
woman dies in a family, every ceremony of an auspicious nature must be
preceded by sumangaliprarthana, or worship of this married woman
(sumangali). Orthodox females think that, if the ceremony is not
performed, she will do them some harm. Another custom, now dying out,
is the tying of a dagger to the waist of the bridegroom.
In the Madura district, the Kavarais are described<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e3692src" href="#xd21e3692" name="xd21e3692src">126 as
being &ldquo;most commonly manufacturers and sellers of bangles made of
a particular kind of earth, found only in one or two parts of the
district. Those engaged in this traffic usually call themselves Chettis
or merchants. When otherwise employed as spinners, dyers, painters, and
the like, they take the title of N&#257;yakkan. It is customary with
these, as with other N&#257;yakkans, to wear the sacred thread: but the
descendants of the N&#257;yakkan kings, who are now living at
Vellei-kuricchi, do not conform to this usage, on the ground that they
are at present in a state of impurity and degradation, and consequently
ought not to wear the sacred emblem.&rdquo;
The bulk of the Kavarais in Tanjore are said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3697src" href="#xd21e3697" name="xd21e3697src">127 &ldquo;to
bear the title N&#257;yak. Some that are engaged in trade, more
especially those who sell glass bangles, are called Settis, and those
who originally settled in agriculture are called Reddis. The title of
N&#257;yak, like Pillai, Mudali, and Setti, is generally sought after.
As a rule, men of the Palli or cooly class, when they enter the
Government service, and shepherds, when they grow <span class=
"pagenum">[266]rich
in trade or otherwise, assume this title, wear the n&#257;mam (the
trident mark on the forehead emblematic of the Vaishnava persuasion),
and call themselves Kavarais or Vadugars, though they cannot speak
Telugu, much less point to any part of the Telugu country as the seat
of their forefathers.&rdquo;
One of the largest sub-divisions of the Kavarais is Valaiyal, the
Tamil equivalent of Gazula, both words meaning a glass or lac
bangle.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3704src" href="#xd21e3704" name=

K&#257;vuthiyan.&mdash;The K&#257;vuthiyans are described as
follows in the Gazetteer of Malabar. &ldquo;They are barbers who serve
the Tiyans and lower castes; they are also sometimes given the title
Kurup. Their females act as midwives. There seem to be several
sections, distinguished by the affix of the name of the castes which
they serve, as for instance Tacchak&#257;vuthiyan or Tacchakurup, and
Kanisak&#257;vuthiyan, appropriated to the service of the As&#257;ris
and Kanisans respectively; while the barbers who serve the Izhuvans are
known both as Adutt&#333;ns, Vattis, or Izhuva K&#257;vuthiyans. But
whether all these should be regarded as offshoots of one main barber
caste, or as degraded sections of the castes which they serve, the
K&#257;vuthiyans proper being only barbers to the Tiyans, it is
difficult to determine. The fact that the N&#257;viyan or
K&#257;vuthiyan section of the Veluttedans, as well as the
K&#257;vuthiyan section of the Mukkuvans, are admittedly but degraded
sections of these castes, makes the second the more probable view. It
is also to be noticed that the K&#257;vuthiyans, in the north at least,
follow marumakkatt&#257;yam (inheritance in the female line), while the
Taccha and Kanisa K&#257;vuthiyans follow the other principle of
descent.&rdquo; [<a id="pb267" href="#pb267"
name="pb267">267]
Kayal&#257;n.&mdash;The Kayal&#257;ns are Tamil-speaking
Muhammadans, closely allied to the Marakk&#257;yars and living at
K&#257;yalpatnam in Tinnevelly. Many of them have settled as merchants
in Madras, and sell glass beads, cowry shells, dolls from Tirupati,
toys, etc. Some are money-lenders to the lower classes, and others
travel about from village to village selling, for cash or credit rates,
cloths, brass vessels, and other articles. They are sometimes called
&#256;rum&#257;saththukadank&#257;rar, or six months&rsquo; debt
people, as this is the time usually allowed for payment. At
K&#257;yalpatnam, a Kayal&#257;n husband is expected to live in his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house, and, in connection with this custom, the
following legend is narrated. The chiefman of the town gave his
daughter in marriage to a man living in an adjacent village. One
evening, she went to fetch water from a tank, and, on her way back,
trod on a cobra. She could not move her foot, lest she should be
bitten, so she stood where she was, with her water-pot on her head,
till she was discovered by her father on the following morning. He
killed the snake with the kitti (tweezers) and knife which he had with
him, and told the girl to go with him to his house. She, however,
refused to do so, and went to her husband&rsquo;s house, from which she
was subsequently taken to that of her father. The kitti is an
instrument of torture, consisting of two sticks tied together at one
end, between which the fingers were placed as in a lemon squeezer. With
this instrument, the fingers were gradually bent backwards towards the
back of the hand, until the sufferer, no longer able to endure the
excruciating pain, yielded to the demands made on him to make
confession of guilt.

Kelasi.&mdash;For the following account of the Kelasi or
barber caste of South Canara, I am indebted to a note on the barbers of
Tuluva by Mr. M. Bapu Rao.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3748src" href=
"#xd21e3748" name="xd21e3748src">129 The caste name is derived from
kelasa, work. In like manner, the Canarese barbers of Bellary and
Dharwar call themselves Kashta M&#257;d&#333;varu, or those who perform
the difficult task.
The barbers of South Canara are of different castes or sub-castes
according to the language they speak, or the people for whom they
operate. Thus there are (1) the Tulu Kelsi (Kutchid&#257;ye, man of the
hair) or Bhand&#257;ri; (2) the Konkani Kelsi or Mh&#257;llo, who must
have migrated from the north; (3) the Hindustani Kelsi or Haj&#257;ms;
(4) the Ling&#257;yat Kelsi or Hadapavada (man of the wallet); (5) the
M&#257;ppilla (Moplah) barber Vasa; (6) the Malay&#257;li barber
K&#257;vudiyan; and even Telugu and Tamil barbers imported by the sepoy
regiments until recently stationed at Mangalore. Naturally the Tulus
form the bulk of the class in Tuluva. There is among them a section
known as Maddele, employed by palm-tappers, and hence considered
socially inferior to [<a id="pb269" href="#pb269"
name="pb269">269]the Bhand&#257;ri, who is employed by the
higher classes. [The Billava barbers are called Par&#275;l Madiali or
Par&#275;l Madivala.] If a high caste barber operates for a man of
lower caste, he loses his caste thereby, and has to pay a fine, or in
some other way expiate his offence before he gains re-admission into
his community. Pariahs in these parts have no separate caste of
barbers, but anyone among themselves may try his skill on any head.
M&#257;ppilla barbers are employed only by the Muhammadans. Even in
their own community, however, they do not live in commensality with
other M&#257;ppillas though gradations of caste are not recognised by
their religion.
The barber is not ambitious enough to claim equality of rank with
the Bant, the potter, the piper, the weaver, or the oilmonger; but he
shows a decided disposition to regard himself as above the level of the
fisherman or the palanquin-bearer. The latter often disclaim any such
inferiority, and refer to the circumstance that they discharge the
functions of carrying the huge umbrella in marriage processions, and
shouldering the gods in religious processions. They argue that their
rivals perform an operation, the defilement of which can only be wiped
off by bathing the head with a solution of sacred earth taken from
besides the roots of the tulsi plant (Ocimum sanctum). In
justice to the barber, however, it must be mentioned that he has to
perform certain priestly duties for most S&#363;dras. His presence is
essential at two of the ceremonies observed by castes professing to be
superior to his. At the name-giving ceremony a Tulu barber has to tie a
thread round the waist of the child, and name it, among S&#363;dras of
a higher caste than himself. [At the present day, the Bhand&#257;ri is
said to receive his fee for tying the thread, though he does not
actually perform the act.] Again, on the death of a <span class=
"pagenum">[270]high
caste S&#363;dra, the barber has to carry the fire to the cremation
ground, though the funeral pyre is lighted by the relations of the
deceased. He also has to assist at certain other rites connected with
funeral obsequies, such as purifying the house.
[The collection of fragments of bones from the ashes, heaping up the
ashes, and cleaning the spot where the corpse was burnt, are the
business of the Kelasi. These duties he performs for Morlis, Bants,
Gattis, and Vodaris. The Bhand&#257;ri or Kelasi is an object of
intense hatred to Konkani women, who call them by abusive names, such
as fellow with a burnt face, miserable wretch, widow-maker, etc.]
The barber in South Canara has invented several stories concerning
the origin of his first progenitor. At a time when the barber had not
yet been created, Siva was a bachelor, spending his time in austere
devotions, and allowing his hair to grow into long matted locks. A time
came when he became bent on matrimony, and he thought that the hirsute
condition of his face would not be appreciated by his bride, the young
daughter of the king of the mountains. It was at this juncture that the
barber was created to make Siva a good-looking bridegroom, and the
Br&#257;hman to officiate at the marriage ceremony. According to
another legend, a G&#257;ndharva-born woman was on one occasion cast
into the sea by irate Brahma, and doomed to be turned into a rock.
Moved by her piteous entreaties, however, Brahma relented, and ordained
that she should be restored to human form when Parasur&#257;ma should
happen to set his foot upon the rock. This came to pass when
Parasur&#257;ma thrust back the waters of the western sea in order to
create the western coast. The re-humanised woman thereupon offered her
thanksgivings in such [<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271]winning words that the great
Br&#257;hman hero asked her to beg any boon she wished. She begged a
son, who should in some way remind generations to come of the great
Br&#257;hman who had reclaimed her from her inanimate state. The boon
was thereupon granted that she should give birth to sons, who would not
indeed be Br&#257;hmans, but who would perform functions analogous to
those performed by Br&#257;hmans. The barber thus discharges certain
priestly duties for S&#363;dras, and cleanses the body even as the
Br&#257;hman cleanses the soul; and the defilement caused by the razor
can be removed only by the smearing of mud and water, because the
barber&rsquo;s female progenitor was a rock recovered out of water.
The primary occupation of the barber does not always bring in a
sufficient income, while it leaves him a large amount of leisure. This
he spends, if possible, in agricultural labour, in which he is
materially assisted by his female relations. Barbers residing in towns
hold no land to fall back upon, but their average monthly earnings
range from five to seven rupees. Their brethren in the villages are not
so busy plying the razor, so they cultivate land as tenants. One of the
blessings conferred by Parasur&#257;ma is that the barber shall never
starve.
When a child is born, a male member of the family has to tie a
thread round its waist, and give it a name. The choice of a name often
depends upon the day of the week on which the child was born. If it is
born on a Sunday it is called, if a boy, Aitha (Auditya, sun), or, if a
girl, Aithe; if on a Monday, S&#333;m&#275; or S&#333;mu; if on a
Tuesday, Ang&#257;ra or Ang&#257;re; if on a Wednesday, Bud&#257;ra or
Bud&#257;re, changed among Pariahs into Mud&#257;ra or Mud&#257;ru; if
on a Thursday, Guruva or Guruvu; if on [<a id=
"pb272" href="#pb272" name="pb272">272]a Friday, Tukra
(Shukra) or Tukru; if on a Saturday, Taniya (Saniya) or Taniyaru. Other
names which are common are Lakkana (Lakshmana), Krishna, Subba, and
Korapulu (Koraga woman). Those who can afford to do so often employ a
Br&#257;hman priest to ascertain whether the child is born lucky or
unlucky; and, in the latter case, the barber is advised to offer
something to the tutelary deity or the nine planets, or to propitiate
the village deity, if it is found that the child is born under its evil
eye. No lullaby should be sung while the child is being rocked for the
first time in a cradle, perhaps because, if the very first rocking is
done with a show of rejoicing, some evil spirit may be envious of the
human joy, and mar the happiness.
The initiation of a boy into the mysteries of his hereditary
profession takes place between the tenth and the fourteenth year. In
very rare cases, nowadays, a boy is sent to school between the sixth
and eighth year. These occasions are marked by offerings of cocoanuts
and plantains to the village deity.
With boys marriage takes place between the sixteenth and
twenty-fifth year, with girls before or after puberty. Matches are made
by selection on the part of the parents. Lads are sometimes allowed to
choose their own brides, but their choice is subject to the approval of
the parents, as it must necessarily be in a joint family. Bridegrooms
have to pay for their brides a dowry varying from twenty to fifty
rupees, and sometimes as much as a hundred rupees. Deformed girls,
however, fetch no price; on the other hand, they have to pay some
pecuniary inducement to the bridegroom. Widows are allowed, and, when
young, encouraged to remarry. The most essential condition of a valid
marriage is that the contracting parties should belong to different
baris or balis (exogamous [<a id="pb273" href=
"#pb273" name="pb273">273]septs). As examples of the names
of these balis, the following may be cited: Bang&#257;ru (gold),
S&#257;lia (weaver), Uppa (salt), Kombara (cap made of areca palm
leaf), Karimbara (sugar-cane). Horoscopes are not consulted for the
suitability or future prosperity of a match, but the day and hour, or
lagnam of a marriage are always fixed by a Br&#257;hman priest with
reference to the conjunction of stars. The marriage lasts for three
days, and takes place in the house of the bridegroom. This is in
accordance with the primitive conception of marriage as a bringing away
by force or procuring a bride from her parents, rather than with the
current Br&#257;hman idea that the bridegroom should be invited, and
the girl given away as a present, and committed to his custody and
protection. The marriage ceremony takes place in a pandal (booth) on a
raised or conspicuous place adorned with various figures or mandala.
The pair are made to sit on a bench, and rice is sprinkled on their
heads. A barber then shaves the chin and forehead of the bridegroom,
the hair border being in the form of a broken pointed arch converging
upwards. He also touches the bride&rsquo;s cheeks with the razor, with
the object of removing what is called monetha kale, the stain on the
face. The full import of this ceremony is not clear, but the barbers
look upon the act as purificatory. If a girl has not come of age at the
time of marriage, it is done on the occasion of the nuptials. If she
has, the barber, in addition to touching the cheeks with the razor,
goes to her house, sprinkles some water over her with a betel leaf, and
makes her touch the pot in which rice is to be cooked in her
husband&rsquo;s house. At the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, before the
assembled guests, elders, and headman of the caste, the man and the
girl are linked together in the marriage bond by having water
(dh&#257;re) poured on their joined hands. Next, the right <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name=
"pb274">274]hands of the pair being joined
(kaipatt&#257;vane), the bridegroom leads the bride to her future
home.
Soon after a death occurs, a barber is summoned, who sprinkles water
on the corpse, and touches it with a razor if it be of a male. In every
ceremony performed by him, the barber must have recourse to his razor,
even as the Br&#257;hman priest cannot do without his k&#363;sa grass.
The rich burn their dead, and the poor bury them. Persons dying of
infectious diseases are always buried. Prior to the removal of the
corpse to the cremation or burial ground, all the clothes on and about
it, with the exception of one cloth to cover it from head to foot, are
removed and distributed to Pariahs, who have prepared the pyre or dug
the grave. Before the mourners return from the cemetery, they light
four lamps in halves of cocoanuts, and leave them burning on the spot.
Coming home, the chief mourner places in the hands of the Guruk&#257;ra
or headman of the caste a jewel or other valuable article as a security
that he will duly perform all the funeral rites. This is termed
s&#257;vuotti dipun&#257;. The Guruk&#257;ra, in the presence of the
relations and friends assembled, returns the same, enjoining its
recipient to be prepared to perform the requisite rites, even with the
proceeds of the sale of the pledged article if necessary. The eleventh
day is the s&#257;vu or principal mourning day, on which the headman
and elders of the caste, as well as the friends and relations of the
deceased ought to be present. On the spot where the deceased expired,
or as near thereto as possible, an ornamental square scaffolding is
erected, and covered with cloth coloured with turmeric. The ground
below the scaffolding is covered with various figures, and flowers and
green leaves are strewn on it. Each mourner throws on this spot
handfuls of cooked rice, coloured yellow and red, and cries out
&ldquo;Oh! uncle, [<a id="pb275" href="#pb275"
name="pb275">275]I cry murrio,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oh! father,
I cry murrio,&rdquo; and so on, according to the relationship in which
the deceased stood to the mourner. This ceremony is called murrio
korpuna, or crying alas. In well-to-do families it is usual to
accompany this with devil-dancing. On the twelfth day, rice is offered
to crows, the original belief apparently being that the spirits of the
deceased enter into birds or beasts, so that food given to these may
happen to reach and propitiate them. On the night of the thirteenth
day, the relations of the deceased set apart a plantain leaf for the
spirit of the departed, serve cooked rice on it, and, joining their
hands, pray that the soul may be gathered unto its ancestors, and rest
in peace. The anniversary of the death, called agel, is celebrated by
placing cooked rice on two plantain leaves placed over sacrificial
twigs, and burning incense and waving lamps before it. This is called
soma dipun&#257;.
The family god of the barber is Krishna of Udipi, and the
high-priest to whom he pays homage is the Saniy&#257;si (religious
ascetic), who for the time being worships that god. The same
high-priest is also the final court of appeal from the decisions of the
village council of the barbers in matters relating to caste and
religion. The powers which are ever present to the barber&rsquo;s mind,
and which he always dreads and tries to propitiate, are the village
demons, and the departed spirits of members of his own family. If a
child falls ill, he hastens to the Br&#257;hman seer, to learn who is
offended, and how the spirit should be appeased. If his cow does not
eat hay, he anxiously enquires to which demon he should carry a cock.
If the rain fails or the crops are poor, he hies to the nearest deity
with cocoanuts, plantains, and the tender spikes of areca. In case of
serious illness, he undertakes a vow to beg from door to door on
certain [<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276]days, and convey the money thus accumulated to
Tirupati. In his house, he keeps a small closed box with a slit in the
lid, through which he drops a coin at every pinch of misfortune, and
the contents are eventually sent to that holy place.
The affairs of the community are regulated by a council of elders.
In every village, or for every group of houses, there is an hereditary
Guruk&#257;ra or headman of the barbers, who is assisted by four
Moktesars. If any of these five authorities receives a complaint, he
gives notice to the others, and a meeting is arranged to take place in
some house. When there is a difference of opinion, the opinion of the
majority decides the issue. When a decision cannot be arrived at, the
question is referred to the council of another village. If this does
not settle the point at issue, the final appeal lies to the Sw&#257;mi
of the the Udipi temple. The council inquires into alleged offences
against caste, and punishes them. It declares what marriages are valid,
and what not. It not only preserves discipline within the community
itself, but takes notice of external affairs affecting the well-being
of the community. Thus, if the pipers refuse to make music at their
marriage processions, the council resolves that no barber shall shave a
piper. Disputes concerning civil rights were once submitted to these
councils, but, as their decisions are not now binding, aggrieved
parties seek justice from courts of law.
Punishments consist of compensation for minor offences affecting
individuals, and of fine or excommunication if the offence affects the
whole community. If the accused does not attend the trial, he may be
excommunicated for contempt of authority. If the person seeks
re-admission into the caste, he has to pay a fine, which goes to the
treasury of the temple at Udipi. The [<a id=
"pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277]presiding Sw&#257;mi
at the shrine accepts the fine, and issues a writ authorising the
re-admission of the penitent offender. The headman collects the fine to
be forwarded to the Sw&#257;mi, and, if he is guilty of any
mal-practice, the whole community, generally called the ten, may take
cognisance of the offence. Offences against marriage relations, shaving
low caste people, and such like, are all visited with fine, which is
remitted to the Sw&#257;mi, from whom purification is obtained. The
power of the village councils, however, has greatly declined in recent
years, as the class of cases in which their decision can be enforced is
practically very small.
The Tulu barbers, like many other castes on the western coast,
follow the aliya sant&#257;na system of inheritance (in the female
line). The tradition in South Canara is that this, and a number of
other customs, were imposed upon certain castes by Bh&#363;t&#257;la
P&#257;ndya. The story relates that D&#275;va P&#257;ndya, a merchant
of the P&#257;ndya kingdom, once had some new ships built, but before
they put to sea, the demon Kundodara demanded a human sacrifice. The
merchant asked his wife to spare one of her seven sons for the purpose,
but she refused to be a party to the sacrifice, and went away with her
sons to her father&rsquo;s house. The merchant&rsquo;s sister thereupon
offered her son. Kundodara, however, was so very pleased with the
appearance of this son that he spared his life, and made him a king,
whose sway extended over Tuluva. This king was called Bh&#363;t&#257;la
P&#257;ndya, and he, being directed by Kundodara, imposed upon the
people the system of nephew inheritance.
The barber is changing with the times. He now seldom uses the old
unfoldable wooden-handled razor forged by the village blacksmith, but
has gone in for what he calls R&#257;ja sri (royal fortune; corruption
of [<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278]Rodgers) razors. He believes that he is polluted
by the operation which it is his lot to perform, and, on his return
home from his morning round, he must bathe and put on washed
clothes.

K&#275;pum&#257;ri.&mdash;It is noted, in the Gazetteer of
South Arcot, that &ldquo;the K&#275;pum&#257;ris are one of the several
foreign communities from other districts, who help to swell the total
of the criminal classes in South Arcot. Their head-quarters is at
Tiruvall&#363;r in the Chingleput district, but there is a settlement
of them at M&#257;riy&#257;nkuppam (not far from Porto Novo), and
another large detachment at Kunisampet in French territory. They commit
much the same class of crime as the Donga D&#257;saris, frequenting
railway trains and crowded gatherings, and they avert suspicion by
their respectable appearance and pleasant manners. Their house-language
is Telugu. They call themselves Alagiri K&#275;pum&#257;ris. The
etymology of the second of these two words is not free from doubt, but
the first of them is said to be derived from Alagar, the god of the
Kallans, whose temple at the foot of the hills about twelve miles north
of Madura town is a well-known place of pilgrimage, and to whom these
people, and other criminal fraternities annually offer a share of their
ill-gotten gains.&rdquo; Information concerning the criminal methods of
these people, under the name Capemari, will be found in Mr. F. S.

K&#275;vuto.&mdash;It is recorded, in the Madras Census
Report, 1891, that &ldquo;the K&#275;vutas are the fisherman caste of
Ganjam, and they are said to be the descendants of the Kaibartas, a
fishing caste of Bengal. Besides fishing in rivers, canals and lakes,
they ply boats and catamarans, and some are also traders. Uriya
Br&#257;hmans and Bair&#257;gis are their priests. From the fifth day
after child-birth till the twenty-first, the Uriya Br&#257;hmans read
the Bh&#257;gavata Pur&#257;na in the house, and on the last day they
give a name to the child. The married girls and widows put a veil over
their faces whenever they go out of doors.&rdquo;
The K&#275;vutos are low in the social scale, but not a polluting
caste. They apparently recognise the following endogamous
sub-divisions:&mdash;Bhettiya, Bilva, Jonka, Khottia, Koibarto or Dasa,
Liy&#257;ri, Chuditiya, and Thossa. Of these the Thossas are
cultivators, the Liy&#257;ris make a preparation of fried rice (liya),
and the Chudityas are engaged in parching grain (chuda, parched rice).
By reason of their change of occupation, the Liy&#257;ris and Chudityas
have practically become distinct castes, and some deny that there is
any connection between them and the K&#275;vutos. Telugu people
sometimes call the Chuditiyas Neyyalu, and I am told that there is a
street in Parlakimedi almost wholly inhabited by K&#275;vutos, who say
that they are of the Neyyalu caste. [<a id=
"pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280]
Of g&#333;tras which occur among the K&#275;vutos, n&#257;go
(cobra), bh&#257;go (tiger), and kochipo (tortoise) are the most
common. They also have exogamous septs or bamsams, among which are
gogudiya (bells) and nolini (bamboo carrier). The titles which occur in
the caste are B&#275;hara, Sitto, Torei, Jalli, Bejjo, and Paiko.
The marriage rite is performed at night, and the bride&rsquo;s
father ties a gold bead (konti) on the neck of the bridegroom. The
K&#275;vutos worship especially Dasar&#257;j and Gangad&#275;vi. The
latter is worshipped at the Dasara festival, and, in some places, fowls
and goats are sacrificed in her honour. In the neighbourhood of the
Chilka lake, the goats are not sacrificed, but set at liberty, and
allowed to graze on the K&#257;likad&#275;vi hill. There is a belief
that animals thus devoted to Gangad&#275;vi do not putrify when they
die, but dry up.
In the Vizagapatam Agency tracts, the K&#275;vutos are said to be
notorious for their proficiency in magic and necromancy.

Kharvi.&mdash;The Kharvis are described, in the South Canara
Manual, as &ldquo;Mar&#257;thi fishermen, who migrated to this district
from the Bombay Presidency. The name Kharvi is said to be a corrupt
form of the Sanskrit ksh&#257;r, salt. They are hardworking but
thriftless, and much given to drink, chiefly toddy. They are
sea-fishermen and good sailors, and also work as domestic servants and
labourers. They employ Hav&#299;k Br&#257;hmans to perform their
marriage and other ceremonies. The head of the Sring&#275;ri Math is
their spiritual teacher.&rdquo; [<a id="pb281"
href="#pb281" name="pb281">281]
The Kharvis are Konkani-speaking fishermen and cultivators, found in
the Kundap&#363;r t&#257;luk of South Canara. Those who are not engaged
in fishing always wear the sacred thread, whereas the fishermen wear it
for seven days from the Sr&#257;vana Hunnami, or full-moon day of the
month Sr&#257;vana (August-September), and then remove it. All are
Saivites, and disciples of the Sring&#275;ri mutt. Ajai Masti and Nagu
Masti are the deities specially worshipped by them. They follow the
makkala sant&#257;na law of inheritance (from father to son). Their
headmen are called S&#257;ranga or Pat&#275;l, and these names are used
as titles by members of the families of the headmen. The assistant to
the headman is styled Naik or Naicker.
For the performance of the marriage ceremonial, Shivalli or Kota
Br&#257;hmans are engaged. The dh&#257;re form of marriage (see
Bant) is observed, but there are a few points of detail, which may be
noted. Five women decorate the bride inside her house just before she
comes to the marriage pandal (booth), and tie on her neck a gold bead
(dh&#257;re mani) and black beads. At the pandal she stands in front of
the bridegroom, separated from him by a screen, which is stretched
between them. Garlands of tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) are exchanged,
and the screen is removed. B&#257;shingams (chaplets) are tied on the
foreheads of the bridal pair at the outset of the ceremonial, and are
worn for five days.
The dead are cremated, and, in most cases, the ashes are thrown into
a river. But, among the orthodox, they are taken to Gokarna, and thrown
into the river at that place. On the eleventh day, presents are made to
Br&#257;hmans after purification. On the following day, food is offered
on two leaves to the soul of the deceased. <span class=
"pagenum">[282]
One of the leaves is thrown into water, and the other given to a cow
or bull.
Kh&#257;sa.&mdash;It is noted by the Rev. J. Cain<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3897src" href="#xd21e3897" name=
"xd21e3897src">131 that &ldquo;members of this caste are found
chiefly in attendance on zamindars and other rich people, and report

Khatri.&mdash;The Khatris are described by Mr. Lewis
Rice<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3911src" href="#xd21e3911" name=
"xd21e3911src">132 as &ldquo;silk weavers, who in manners, customs,
and language are akin to Patv&#275;gars, but they do not intermarry
with them, although the two castes eat together. The Katris claim to be
Kshatriyas, and quote R&#275;nuka Pur&#257;na as their authority. The
legend is that, during the general massacre of the Kshatriyas by Parasu
R&#257;ma, five women, each of whom was big with child, escaped, and
took refuge in a temple dedicated to K&#257;li. When the children came
of age, their marriages were celebrated, and their mothers prayed to
K&#257;li to point out some means of livelihood. In answer to their
supplications, the goddess gave them looms, and taught them weaving and
dyeing. The Katris claim descent from these refugees, and follow the
same trades.&rdquo;
The following note relates to the Khatris of Conjeeveram, where most
of them trade in silk thread, silk sashes, and dye-stuffs. Some deal in
human hair, which is used by native females as a chignon. By reason of
their connection with the silk industry, the Khatris are called
Patn&#363;lk&#257;ran by other castes. The true Patn&#363;lk&#257;rans
are called K&#333;shta by the Khatris. The Khatris give Bhuja R&#257;ja
Kshatriya as their caste name, and [<a id="pb283"
href="#pb283" name="pb283">283]some say that they are the
descendants of one Karta Virya Arjuna of the human race. Their tribal
deity is Renuk&#257;mba, the mother of Parasu R&#257;ma, to whom pongal
(boiled rice) is offered, and a goat sacrificed in the month of Thai
(January-February). They have exogamous septs, such as Sul&#275;gar,
Powar, Mudugal, Sonappa, Bojagiri, etc., and have adopted the same
Br&#257;hmanical g&#333;tras as the Bh&#257;ts or Bhatr&#257;zus,
e.g., Gautama, K&#257;syapa, Vasishta, and Bh&#257;radwaja.
Attached to them is a caste beggar, called Bh&#257;t, who comes round
at long intervals. He is said to keep the genealogies of the Khatri
families. He ties a flag to a post of the house at which he intends to
claim a meal, and, after partaking thereof, he receives information
concerning the births and marriages, which have taken place in the
family since his last visit. Girls are married both before and after
puberty, and infant marriage is fashionable at the present day. The
remarriage of widows is permitted, but a divorced woman may not marry
again so long as her husband is alive. A man may not marry the widow of
his brother, or of an agnate. The custom of m&#275;narikam, by which a
man may marry his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter, is prohibited.
Families belonging to one sept may give their daughters in marriage to
men of another sept, from which, however, they are not allowed to
receive girls as wives for their sons. For example, a man of a
Sul&#275;gar sept may give his daughters in marriage to men of the
Powar sept, but may not take Powar girls as wives for his sons. But a
certain elasticity in the rule is allowed, and the prohibition ceases
after a certain number of generations by arrangement with the
Bh&#257;t. The marriage ceremonies last over seven days. On the first
day, the deity Bharkod&#275;v, who is represented <span class=
"pagenum">[284]by
seven quartz pebbles placed in a row on plantain leaves, is worshipped
with offerings of fruit, etc., and a goat is sacrificed. The blood
which flows from its cut neck is poured into a vessel containing cooked
rice, of which seven balls are made, and offered to the pebbles.
Towards evening some of the rice is thrown to the four cardinal points
of the compass, in order to conciliate evil spirits. On the second day,
the house is thoroughly cleansed with cow-dung water, and the walls are
whitewashed. The eating of meat is forbidden until the marriage
ceremonies are concluded. The third day is devoted to the erection of
the marriage pandal (booth) and milk-post, and the worship of female
ancestors (sav&#257;sne). Seven married women are selected, and
presented with white r&#257;vikes (bodices) dyed with turmeric. After
bathing, they are sumptuously fed. Before the feast, the
bridegroom&rsquo;s and sometimes the bride&rsquo;s mother, goes to a
well, tank (pond) or river, carrying on a tray a new woman&rsquo;s
cloth, on which a silver plate with a female figure embossed on it is
placed. Another silver plate of the same kind, newly made, is brought
by a goldsmith, and the two are worshipped, and then taken to the
house, where they are kept in a box. The bridegroom and his party go in
procession through the streets in which their fellow castemen live.
When they reach the house of the bride, her mother comes out and waves
coloured water to avert the evil eye, washes the bridegroom&rsquo;s
eyes with water, and presents him with betel and a vessel filled with
milk. The bride is then conducted to the bridegroom&rsquo;s house,
where she takes her seat on a decorated plank, and a gold or silver
ornament called sari or kanti is placed on her neck. She is further
presented with a new cloth. A Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit then writes the
names [<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285]of the contracting parties, and the date of
their marriage, on two pieces of palm leaf or paper, which he hands
over to their fathers. The day closes with the performance of gondala
p&#363;ja, for which a device (muggu) is made on the ground with
yellow, red, and white powders. A brass vessel is set in the centre
thereof, and four earthen pots are placed at the corners. P&#363;ja
(worship) is done, and certain stanzas are recited amid the beating of
a pair of large cymbals. On the fourth day, the bridal couple bathe,
and the bridegroom is invested with the sacred thread. They then go to
the place where the metal plates representing the ancestors are kept,
with a cloth thrown over the head like a hood, and some milk and cooked
rice are placed near the plates. On their way back they, in order to
avert the evil eye, place their right feet on a pair of small earthen
plates tied together, and placed near the threshold. The bride&rsquo;s
mother gives the bridegroom some cakes and milk, after partaking of
which he goes in procession through the streets, and a further ceremony
for averting the evil eye is performed in front of the bride&rsquo;s
house. This over, he goes to the pandal, where his feet are washed by
his father-in-law, who places in his hands a piece of plantain fruit,
over which his mother-in-law pours some milk. The bride and bridegroom
then go into the house, where the latter ties the t&#257;li on the neck
of the former. During the tying ceremony, the couple are separated by a
cloth screen, of which the lower end is lifted up. The screen is
removed, and they sit facing each other with their bashingams (forehead
chaplets) in contact, and rice is thrown over their heads by their
relations. The Br&#257;hman hands the contracting couple the
wrist-threads (kankanams), which they tie on. These threads are, among
most castes, tied at an earlier stage in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286]marriage ceremonies. On the fifth day, seven
betel nuts are placed in a row on a plank within the pandal, round
which the bride and bridegroom go seven times. At the end of each
round, the latter lifts the right foot of the former, and sweeps off
one of the nuts. For every marriage, a fee of Rs. 12&ndash;5&ndash;0
must be paid to the headman of the caste, and the money thus
accumulated is spent on matters such as the celebration of festivals,
which affect the entire community. If the fee is not paid, the bride
and bridegroom are not permitted to go round the plank the seventh
time. On the sixth day, the bride receives presents from her family,
and there is a procession at night. On the last day of the ceremonies,
the bride is handed over to her mother-in-law by her mother, who says
&ldquo;I am giving you a melon and a knife. Deal with them as you
please.&rdquo; The bride is taken inside the house by the mother-in-law
and shown some pots containing rice into which she dips her right hand,
saying that they are full. The mother-in-law then presents her with a
gold finger-ring, and the two eat together as a sign of their new
relationship.
The dead are cremated, and, when a married man dies, his corpse is
carried on a palanquin to the burning-ground, followed by the widow.
Near the pyre it is laid on the ground, and the widow places her
jewelry and glass bangles on the chest. The corpse should be carried by
the sons-in-law if possible, and the nomination of the bearers is
indicated by the eldest son of the deceased person making a mark on
their shoulders with ashes. On the third day after death, the milk
ceremony takes place. Three balls of wheat-flour, mixed with honey and
milk, are prepared, and placed respectively on the spot where the
deceased breathed his last, where the bier was laid on the ground, and
at [<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287]the place where the corpse was burnt, over which
milk is poured. The final death ceremonies (karm&#257;ndhiram) are
observed on the seventh or tenth day, till which time the eating of
flesh is forbidden.
The headman of the Khatris, who is called Gr&#257;mani, is elected
once a month, and he has an assistant called Vanja, who is appointed
annually.
The Khatris are Saivites, and wear the sacred thread, but also
worship various gr&#257;ma d&#275;vatas (village deities). They speak a
dialect of Mar&#257;thi. The caste title is S&#257;, e.g.,
Dharma S&#257;.
Kethree is described, in the Vizagapatam Manual, as &ldquo;the caste
of the Zamindar&rsquo;s family in Jeypore. It is divided into sixteen
classes. They wear the paieta (sacred thread), and the Zamindar used
formerly to sell the privilege of wearing it to any one who could
afford to pay him twelve rupees. Pariahs were excluded from purchasing
the privilege.&rdquo;
The Khatri agriculturists of the Jeypore Agency tracts in
Vizagapatam are, Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao informs me, entirely distinct
from the weaving Khatris of the south. They are divided into four
septs, viz., Surya (Sun), Bh&#257;g (tiger), Kochchimo (tortoise), and
N&#257;g (cobra). Girls are married before puberty, and an Oriya
Br&#257;hman officiates at their marriages, instead of the customary
D&#275;s&#257;ri. They do not, like other castes in the Agency tracts,
give fermented liquor (madho) as part of the jholla tonka or
bride-price, which consists of rice, a goat, cloths, etc. The marriage
ceremonies are performed at the bride&rsquo;s house. These Khatris put
on the sacred thread for the first time when they are married, and
renew it from time to time throughout life. They are fair skinned, and
speak the Oriya language. Their usual title is P&#257;tro. <span class=

Nahako S&#257;hu, and under him there are deputies called Dhoyi Nahako

peculiar duty is said to be to join in the first meal taken by those
who have been excommunicated, and subsequently readmitted into the

of the caste was Orissa, and that it came to Ganjam with

For the following note on the Kh&#333;jas of Southern India, I am
indebted to an article by Dr. J. Shortt.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3980src" href="#xd21e3980" name="xd21e3980src">134 &ldquo;The
true Kojahs, or eunuchs, are not numerous in Southern India. They are
chiefly to be seen in the houses of wealthy Mussalman nobles, by whom
they are placed at the head of their zenanas or harems. The Kojahs are
properly divided into two classes: (1) Kojahs; (2) Hijras. Sometimes
Hindus, S&#363;dras, and Br&#257;hmans subject themselves to the
operation (of castration), of their own accord from a religious
impression. Others, finding themselves naturally impotent, consider it
necessary to undergo the operation, to avoid being born again at a
future birth in the same helpless state. The operation of castration is
generally performed by a class of barbers, sometimes by some of the
more intelligent of the eunuchs themselves, in the following manner.
The patient is made to sit on an upturned new earthen pot, being
previously well drugged with opium or bhang. The entire genitals being
seized by the left hand, an assistant, who has a bamboo lath slit in
the centre, runs it down quite close to the pubis, the slit firmly
embracing the whole of the genitals at the root, when the operator,
with a sharp razor, runs it down along the face of the lath, and
removes penis, testicles and scrotum in one swoop, leaving a large
clean open wound behind, in which boiling gingelly (Sesamum
indicum) oil is poured to staunch the bleeding, and the wound
covered over with a soft rag steeped in warm oil. This is the only
dressing applied to the wound, which is renewed daily, while the
patient is confined in a supine position to his bed, and lightly fed
with conjee (rice gruel), milk, etc. During the operation, <span class=
"pagenum">[290]the
patient is urged to cry out &lsquo;D&#299;n&rsquo; (the faith in
Mahomet) three times.
&ldquo;Of the two classes, the Kojahs are the artificially created
eunuchs, in contradistinction to the Hijras (impotents) or natural
eunuchs. Some years ago there were three Kojahs at the head of the
State prison or Royal Mahal at Vellore, in charge of some of the wives,
descendants, and other female connections of Tippoo Sultan. These men
were highly respected, held charges of considerable trust, and were
Muhammadans by birth. Tales were often repeated that the zenana women
(slaves and adopted girls) were in the habit of stripping them naked,
and poking fun at their helplessness. There were two Kojahs in the
employ of the late Nabob of the Carnatic. They were both Africans. On
the death of the Nabob, the Government allowed one of them a pension of
fifteen rupees a month.
&ldquo;The second class, Hijras or natural eunuchs as they are
termed, are not so, strictly speaking, but are said to be impotent.
While some are naturally so from birth, others are impressed with a
belief in childhood, and are dressed up in women&rsquo;s clothes,
taught to ape their speech and manners, whilst a few adopt it as a
profession in after-life. They are chiefly Mussalmans. The hair of the
head is put up as in women, well oiled, combed, and thrown back, tied
into a knot, and shelved to the left side, sometimes plaited,
ornamented, and allowed to hang down the back. They wear the cholee or
short jacket, the saree or petticoat, and put on abundance of nose,
ear, finger, and toe rings. They cultivate singing, play the dhol (a
drum), and attitudinise. They go about the bazaars in groups of half a
dozen or more, singing songs with the hope of receiving a trifle. [Such
a group [<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291]I saw at Sand&#363;r, who, on hearing that I
wished to photograph them, made tracks for another
place.&mdash;E.T.] They are not only persistent, but impudent
beggars, singing filthy, obscene, and abusive songs, to compel the
bazaarmen to give them something. Should they not succeed, they would
create a fire and throw in a lot of chillies, the suffocating and
irritative smoke producing violent coughing, etc., so that the
bazaarmen are compelled to yield to their importunity, and give them a
trifle to get rid of their annoyance. While such were the pursuits in
the day, at nightfall they resorted to debauchery and low practices by
hiring themselves out to a dissipated set of Moslems, who are in the
habit of resorting to these people for the purpose, whilst they
intoxicate themselves with a preparation termed majoon, being a
confection of opium, and a drink termed boja, a species of country beer
manufactured from r&#257;gi (Eleusine Coracana), which also
contains bhang (Indian hemp). In addition to this, they smoke bhang.
The Hijras are met with in most of the towns of Southern India, more
especially where a large proportion of Mussalmans is found.&rdquo;
In Hyderabad, castration used to be performed at about the age of
sixteen. A pit, 3&frac12; feet deep, was dug in the ground, and filled
with ashes. After the operation, the patient had to sit on the ashes,
with crossed legs, for three days. The operation was performed, under
the influence of narcotics, by a P&#299;r&mdash;the head of the
Kh&#333;ja community.
I am informed by Mr. G. T. Paddison that, at the annual festival of
the Gadabas of Vizagapatam, thorns are set on a swing outside the
shrine of the goddess. On these the priest or priestess sits without
harm. If the priest is masculine, he has been made neuter. But,
[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292]if the village is not fortunate enough to
possess a eunuch, a woman performs the ceremony.
The following notes were recorded by me on the occasion of an
interview with some eunuchs living in the city of Madras:&mdash;
Hindu, aged about 30. Generative organs feebly developed. Is a
natural eunuch. Speaks and behaves like a female. Keeps a stall, at
which he sells cakes. Goes out singing and dancing with four other
eunuchs, and earns from ten annas to a rupee in a night. There are, in
Madras, about thirty eunuchs, who go about dancing. Others keep shops,
or are employed as domestic servants.
One well acquainted with the Hindu eunuchs of Madras stated that,
when a boy is born with ill-developed genitalia, his unnatural
condition is a source of anxiety to his parents. As he grows up he
feels shy, and is made fun of by his companions. Such boys run away
from home, and join the eunuchs. They are taught to sing and dance, and
carry on abominable practices. They are employed by dancing-girls, to
decoy paramours to them. For this purpose, they dress up as
dancing-girls, and go about the streets. At times of census, they
return themselves as males engaged in singing and dancing.

them pictures painted in colours on deer skins, which are well tanned,
and made fine like parchment. The several parts of the picture
representing the human or animal body are attached to each other by
thin iron wires, and the parts are made to move by the assistance of
thin bamboo splits, and thus the several actions and emotions are
represented to the public, to the accompaniment of songs. Their
pictures are in most cases very fairly painted, with variety and choice
of colours. The stories chosen for representation are generally from
the R&#257;m&#257;yana and the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rat&#257;, which they

occupational name, denoting those who cultivate k&#299;rai
(Amarantus). The K&#299;raikk&#257;rans are stated, in the
Census Report, 1901, to be usually Agamudaiyans in Coimbatore. I
gathered, however, that the name is given by Tamil-speaking people to
the Kempati Okkiliyans of Coimbatore, a Canarese people who migrated
thither from Kempati in Mysore. The majority of them cultivate
k&#299;rai and other edible vegetables, but some are petty traders or
fishermen. Some of their marriage divisions are named after deities,

Kodikk&#257;l.&mdash;Kodikk&#257;l, Kodikkar, or
Kodikk&#257;lk&#257;ran, meaning betel vine man, is the occupational
name of a sub-division of Vella&#817;las, and of Labbai Muhammadans who
cultivate the betel vine. In the Census Report, 1901, it is noted that
those who gave this as the name of their caste returned their parent
tongue as Tamil, and their title as Na&#817;yakkan, and were therefore
clubbed with Pallis. Kodikk&#257;l is further a sub-division of the
Sh&#257;n&#257;ns, who derive the name from k&#333;di, a flag, and give
flag-bearer as its significance. Other castes, however, make it to mean
a betel garden, in reference to Sh&#257;n&#257;ns who were betel vine
growers. Kodikk&#257;l Pillaimar is a synonym of the
S&#275;naikkudaiy&#257;ns, indicating Pillaimars who cultivate the
betel vine.

Koil Pandala (keeper of the royal treasury).&mdash;One of the
divisions of Kshatriyas in Travancore.
Koil Tampur&#257;n.&mdash;The following note is extracted
from the Travancore Census Report, 1901. The Koil Tampur&#257;ns form a
small community, made up of the descendants of the immigrant Kshatriya
families from certain parts of Malabar lying to the north of Travancore
and Cochin. They are also known as Koil Pantalas. In early records, the
term Koviladhik&#257;rikal appears to have been used. Immemorial
tradition connects the Koil Tampur&#257;ns with Ch&#275;ram&#257;n
Perum&#257;l, and goes to say that their original settlement was
Beypore. About 300 M.E. a few male members were invited to settle in
Travancore, and form marital alliances with the ladies of the
Travancore Royal House, known then as the V&#275;n&#257;t
Svar&#363;pam. Houses were built for them at Kilim&#257;n&#363;r, six
miles from Attingal, where all the female members of the Royal Family
resided. In M.E. 963, eight persons&mdash;three males and five
females&mdash;from the family of &#256;liakk&#333;tu, oppressed by the
invasion of T&#299;p&#363; Sultan, sought shelter in Travancore.
Mahar&#257;ja R&#257;ma Varma received them kindly, and gave them the
palace of the Tekkumk&#363;r R&#257;ja, who had been subjugated by
R&#257;ma Iyen Dalawah. This site in Changanachery is still recognised
as N&#299;r&#257;zhikkott&#257;ram. In 975 M.E. one of the five ladies
removed to Kirtipuram near Kantiy&#363;r [<a id=
"pb297" href="#pb297" name="pb297">297](Mavelikara
t&#257;luk), and thence to a village called Gr&#257;mam in the same
t&#257;luk. Another shifted to Pallam in the Kottayam t&#257;luk, a
third to Pa&#817;liyakkara in Tiruvalla, and a fourth, having no issue,
continued to live at Changanachery with the fifth lady who was the
youngest in the family. Ra&#817;ja Ra&#257;ja Varma Koil
Tampura&#817;n, who married Ra&#817;ni Lakshmi Bai, sovereign of
Travancore from 985 to 990 M.E. was the eldest son of the lady that
stayed at Changanachery. Their present house at that place, known as
Lakshmipuram Kotta&#817;ram, was named after the Koil
Tampur&#257;n&rsquo;s royal consort. R&#257;ja R&#257;ja Varma&rsquo;s
sister gave birth to three daughters and two sons. The eldest daughter
and sons removed to Kartikapalli in 1040, and thence, in 1046, to
Anantapuram in Haripad. In 1041, the second daughter and issue removed
to Chempr&#333;l in Tiruvalla, while the third continued to live at
Changanachery. Thus there came into existence seven families of Koil
Tampur&#257;ns, namely those of Kilim&#257;n&#363;r, Changanachery,
Anantapuram, Pallam, Chempr&#333;l, Gr&#257;mam, and P&#257;liyakkare.
Some time after 1040 M.E. (A.D. 1856), three more families, viz., those
of Cheruk&#333;l, K&#257;r&#257;mma, and Vatakk&#275;matham, immigrated
from North Malabar.
The Koil Tampur&#257;ns are all regarded as blood relations, and
observe birth and death pollutions like D&#257;y&#257;dis among
Br&#257;hmans. They follow the matriarchal system of inheritance.
Namb&#363;tiri Br&#257;hmans marry their ladies. Their religious
ceremonies are the same as those of Namb&#363;tiris, whom they resemble
in the matter of food and drink. Their caste government is in the hands
of the Namb&#363;tiri Vaidikans.
Their ceremonies are the usual Br&#257;hmanical
Samsk&#257;ras&mdash;G&#257;takarma, N&#257;makarana, Annapr&#257;sana,
etc. Regarding the N&#257;makarana, or naming, the only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298]noteworthy fact is that the first-born male
always goes by the name of R&#257;ja R&#257;ja Varma. The
Upan&#257;yana, or investiture with the sacred thread, takes place in
the sixteenth year of age. On the morning of the Upan&#257;yana, Chaula
or the tonsure ceremony is performed. It is formally done by the
Namb&#363;tiri priest in the capacity of Guru, just as the father does
to his son among Br&#257;hmans, and afterwards left to be completed by
the M&#257;r&#257;n. The priest invests the boy with the thread, and,
with the sacrificial fire as lord and witness, initiates him in the
G&#257;yatri prayer. The Koil Tampur&#257;ns are to repeat this prayer
morning, noon and evening, like the Br&#257;hmans, but are to do so
only ten times on each occasion. On the fourth day, the boy listens to
a few V&#275;dic hymns recited by the priest. There is not the
prolonged course of severe discipline of the Br&#257;hmanical
Brahmach&#257;ri, which the Namb&#363;tiris so religiously observe. The
Sam&#257;vartana, or pupilage stage, is performed on the fifteenth day.
The ceremony of proceeding to Benares is then gone through. Just as in
the case of the Br&#257;hmans, a would-be father-in-law intercedes, and
requests the Sn&#257;taka (past Brahmach&#257;ri) to bless his
daughter, and settle in life as a Grihastha. The Namb&#363;tiri priest
then steps in to remind the boy of his dharma (duty) as a Kshatriya,
and gives him a sword symbolic of his pre-ordained function in
society.
The marriage of a Koil Tampur&#257;n does not present many peculiar
features. One item in the programme, called D&#299;kshavirippu, may be
referred to. During all the four days of the marriage, the bride is
confined to a special room, where a white cloth with a carpet over it
is spread on the floor, and a lamp burns day and night. The ceremonial
bridegroom is either an Aryappattar or a Namb&#363;tiri, now generally
a Namb&#363;tiri. Of course, [<a id="pb299" href=
"#pb299" name="pb299">299]the marriage is a mere ceremonial,
and the bridegroom at the ceremony is not necessarily the spouse of
actual life. His death deprives her of the right to wear the t&#257;li,
and makes her an Amangali (an inauspicious person) for all
socio-religious purposes. At sr&#257;ddhas (memorial service for the
dead), the Tampur&#257;tti with her married husband alive faces the
east, and one that has lost him has to look in the direction of
Yamal&#333;ka (south).
Mr. Ravi Varma, the celebrated artist, who died recently, was a Koil
Tampur&#257;n of Kilim&#257;n&#363;r, an extensive village assigned to

K&#333;layan.&mdash;It is recorded, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, that &ldquo;the caste is found chiefly in the
Kasarag&#333;d t&#257;luk of South Canara, and in the northern part of
Malabar. In South Malabar, it is called &#362;r&#257;li. Its
traditional occupation is herding cows, and it claims the privilege of
supplying milk and ghee to certain Hindu temples, but at present most
of its members are [<a id="pb300" href="#pb300"
name="pb300">300]masons. It has two endogamous sections,
&#256;yan or K&#333;l-&#256;yan, and M&#257;riyan or Erum&#257;n&rdquo;
(Erum&#257;, a cow-buffalo). It is further noted, in the same report
under the heading Erum&#257;n, that &ldquo;the people of the caste were
originally buffalo drivers and keepers, and still follow their
traditional occupation in the Kasarag&#333;d t&#257;luk of South
Canara. In North Malabar, they are masons and bricklayers.&rdquo; The
masonry work of temples is done by K&#333;layans.
The name K&#333;layan has been said to be derived from Golla and
Ayan, meaning cowherd. Golla is, however, a Telugu word not used in the
Malay&#257;lam country.
Members of the two sections, K&#333;layan and Erum&#257;n (or
Eruv&#257;n), are said not to intermarry. Women of both sections may
affect sambandham (alliance) with N&#257;yars. Children born of such
unions are regarded as somewhat inferior to those born of K&#333;layan
parents, and are not allowed to worship at the temples. The priests of
the <span class="corr" id="xd21e4258" title=
"Source: Kol&#257;yans">K&#333;layans are called M&#363;thavan
or Poduvan, and are usually elected by R&#257;jas.
K&#333;layan girls go through the mangalam or t&#257;li-kettu
ceremony before they reach puberty. On an auspicious day fixed by the
Kanisan (astrologer), the girl sits on a plank in the middle room of
the house, and four lamps are placed near her. Her father throws rice
and flowers over her head, and ties the t&#257;li (marriage emblem) on
her neck. The girl, four women, and four girls, are fed in the middle
room. On the following day, a priest (V&#257;thiyan) places rice, paddy
(unhusked rice), tender cocoanut, betel leaves and areca nuts, before
the girl. Men and women of the priest&rsquo;s family wave rice,
cocoanuts, etc., in front of her both in the morning and afternoon.
Finally, towards evening, a V&#257;thiyan woman waves the rice and
other articles thrice, calling out [<a id="pb301"
href="#pb301" name="pb301">301]&ldquo;Kolachi, Kolachi,
Kolachi.&rdquo; The girl may then leave the middle room.
At the first menstrual period, a girl is under pollution for three
days. On the first day, a cloth (m&#257;ttu) is given to her by a
washerwoman, and on the fourth day she receives one from a Malayan
woman.
The dead are usually cremated. Daily, until the twelfth day of the
death ceremonies, food is offered to the spirit of the deceased, on a
dais set up outside the house, by the relatives. On the fifth day, all
the agnates are purified by the V&#257;thiyan sprinkling water over
them. On the twelfth day, the V&#257;thiyan draws the image of a man
with vib&#363;thi (sacred ashes) on the spot where the deceased
breathed his last. Near the figure, cooked rice, vegetables, etc., are
placed. The chief mourner offers these to the dead person, and makes a
bundle of them in his cloth. Going outside the house, he kicks the dais
already referred to with his foot, while the V&#257;thiyan holds one
hand, and his relations the other hand or arm. He then bathes in a tank
(pond) or river, while his hands are held in like manner.
K&#333;li.&mdash;In the Madras Census Report, 1901, the
K&#333;lis are described as being &ldquo;a Bombay caste of fishermen
and boatmen in South Canara; also a low class of Bengal weavers found
in Ganjam.&rdquo; The K&#333;lis who were investigated in Ganjam are an
Oriya-speaking class, who are apparently Telugu people who have settled
in the Oriya country as weavers of coarse cloths, traders, and
agriculturists. They have Oriya titles such as B&#275;hara. They
worship village deities (T&#257;kur&#257;nis), are Saivites, and none
of them have been converted to the Paramartho form of Vishnavism. The
caste council, puberty and death ceremonies, are based on the common
Oriya type, but the marriage rites are [<a id=
"pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302]an interesting blend
of the Oriya and Telugu types of ceremonial. Thus the usual Telugu
marriage post, but made of Streblus asper wood, is set up, and
nine kinds of grain are placed near it. A bottu (marriage badge) is
tied on the neck of the bride by the bridegroom, and the hands of the
contracting couple are united (hasthag&#333;nthi) as among the
Oriyas.
K&#333;liyan.&mdash;The K&#333;liyans are summed up, in the
Madras Census Report, 1901, as &ldquo;a weaver caste, the members of
which were originally Paraiyans, but now do not eat or intermarry with
that caste.&rdquo; They are largely found in the Tanjore and Madura
districts, and are divided into various n&#257;dus (territories) and
kuppams (settlements). Those at Pattukottai, for example, belong to
Ambu N&#257;d&#363;, and are sub-divided into five kuppams. Many of the
K&#333;liyans are engaged in weaving coarse white cloths, while some
work as field labourers. As some Paraiyans have S&#257;mb&#257;n (Siva)
as their title, so the title of the K&#333;liyans is &#298;san (god).
At times of marriage, the names of persons must not be mentioned
without this title, e.g., one who is, in everyday life, called
Ponnan is addressed as &#298;sa Ponnan.
An interesting point in connection with the first puberty ceremonial
of a girl is that, on the sixteenth day, when she bathes, a withe of a
creeper (Dalbergia, sp.) made into a loop, is passed round her
body by a barber from head to foot thrice, without touching her. If
this is not done, it is believed that the girl is not free from
pollution.
There are two forms of marriage ceremony, called chinna (little) and
periya (big) kaly&#257;nam. The former is resorted to by those who
cannot afford the more elaborate ceremonial. The sister of the
bridegroom is sent to the house of the bride on an auspicious day.
[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303]She there ties the t&#257;li (marriage badge) on
the bride&rsquo;s neck, and conducts her to the house of the
bridegroom. Women who are thus married may not take part in the
marriage of their children. More especially, they may not decorate them
with garlands and flowers, unless they have themselves performed the
sadangu rite. In this, which is usually carried out a day or two before
the child&rsquo;s marriage, the husband and wife sit on planks, and,
after being decorated, and the performance of wave offerings
(&#257;rathi), the former ties the t&#257;li on his wife&rsquo;s
neck.
In the periya kaly&#257;nam, the bridegroom goes on a horse to the
bride&rsquo;s house, where he is met by her brother, who is also on
horseback. They exchange garlands, and proceed to the marriage pandal
(booth). The bridegroom receives from the bride&rsquo;s father a
cocoanut, and the bride seats herself on a bench. The bridegroom gives
her the cocoanut, and ties the t&#257;li on her neck. They then
exchange garlands, and their fingers are linked together. All these
items must be performed as quickly as possible, in accordance with a
saying that the t&#257;li should be tied without dismounting from the
horse, which one is riding. Before the t&#257;li is tied, the
contracting couple go through the sadangu ceremony, in which a loop of
cotton thread is passed over them from head to foot, without touching
them. Then the kankanams, or wrist threads, are tied on their wrists.
The milk-post and marriage pots are set up within the pandal, and the
bride and bridegroom prostrate themselves before them, and salute their
maternal uncles, parents and relations, and lastly the musicians. The
day&rsquo;s proceedings terminate with a feast, at the conclusion of
which hands are washed within the house. For six days the bride and
bridegroom pay visits to each [<a id="pb304"
href="#pb304" name="pb304">304]other alternately, and, on
the seventh day, the wrist-threads, marriage pots, and milk-post are
removed. During marriage and other auspicious ceremonies, coloured
water, into which leaves of Bauhinia variegata are thrown, are
waved (&#257;rathi).
On ceremonial occasions, and at times of worship, the K&#333;liyans
put on Saivite sect marks. Among other deities, they worship Aiyanar,
Pattavansw&#257;mi, and Pothiamman.
The dead are burnt, and the body is placed in a seated posture with
fingers and toes tied together. On the way to the burning-ground, a
widow goes round the corpse, and breaks a pot containing water. On the
day after the funeral, the calcined bones are collected, and arranged
so as to represent a human figure, to which food is offered. The final
death ceremonies (karm&#257;ndhiram) are performed on the sixteenth
day. A mass of cooked rice, vegetables, and meat, is placed within an
enclosure, round which the relations go in tears.
Kollakar.&mdash;There are about seven hundred members of this
community at Cochin, to which place the Kollakars, or people of Kollam,
are said to have come from Quilon (Kollam) in Travancore one or two
centuries ago. The majority of the men work as coolies on board
steamers, and a few as fishermen. The women of the poorer classes twist
rope and sell fish, while the others make lace. A few hold appointments
under the Government, and, in 1907, two had passed the Matriculation
examination of the Madras University. They are Roman Catholics, and are
said to have been converted to Christianity by the Portuguese. They
marry among themselves. The Kollakars are also found at Calicut,
Cannanore, Mah&#275;, and Tellicherry, and are mainly occupied in
fishing, rope-making, and making fishing-nets. <span class=
"pagenum">[305]A
few at Tellicherry are employed as carpenters, tailors, and petty
shopkeepers.
Kolla Kurup.&mdash;The Kolla Kurups of Malabar are described,
in the Gazetteer of Malabar, as a sub-caste of, or a caste allied to,
the Kamm&#257;lans. &ldquo;They combine two professions, which at first
sight seem strangely incongruous, shampooing or massage, and the
construction of the characteristic leather shields of Malabar. But the
two arts are intimately connected with the system of combined physical
training, as we should now call it, and exercise in arms, which formed
the curriculum of the kalari (gymnasium), and the title Kurup is proper
to castes connected with that institution.&rdquo; Among Kolla Kurups,
the following symbolical ceremony is necessary to constitute a valid
divorce. &ldquo;The husband and the wife&rsquo;s brother stand east and
west respectively of a lighted lamp placed in the yard of the
woman&rsquo;s original home. The husband pulls a thread from his cloth,
and approaches the lamp, and breaks the thread saying &lsquo;Here is
your sister&rsquo;s acch&#257;ram.&rsquo;&rdquo;
Kollan.&mdash;The blacksmiths are iron-workers among the
Malay&#257;lam Kamm&#257;lans. &ldquo;These Malabar Kollans,&rdquo; Mr.
H. A. Stuart writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4320src" href=
"#xd21e4320" name="xd21e4320src">138 &ldquo;are said to practice
fraternal polyandry to a greater extent even than the rest of the
Malabar artizan castes. Kollans are divided into (1) T&#299; (fire)
Kollan, (2) Perum (big) Kollan, (3) T&#299;perum Kollan, (4) Irumbu

T&#333;l Kollan (leather-workers). These are of inferior status, on
account of the nature of their professions.&rdquo;

K&#333;mati.&mdash;The K&#333;matis form the great trading
caste of the Madras Presidency, and are found in almost all the
districts thereof. They are further found in the Mysore State, Bombay
Presidency, Berar, Central Provinces, and as far north-west as Baroda.
Their wide distribution accounts for the great variety which prevails
in the minor details of the religious and social ceremonials.
The name K&#333;mati has been derived in many different ways. By
some it is said to be from ko-mati, meaning fox-minded. This has
reference to the cunning of the K&#333;matis in business, and is
undoubtedly the outcome of their unpopularity with their customers. The
phrase K&#333;matiguttu (the secrecy of a K&#333;mati) is said to be a
common one. Others say that it is from g&#333;-mati, meaning the
possessor of cows, one of the ordained duties of Vaisyas being the
protecting of cows. Others, again, say that it is from g&#333;-mati,
meaning cow-minded. A modern redaction of the Kanyak&#257; Pur&#257;na,
the sacred book of the K&#333;matis, gives this derivation. According
to this work, the K&#333;matis did severe penance, and were
consequently invited to live in heaven. Their continued absence from
this world gave rise to serious trouble, and Vishnu accordingly asked
them to return thither for [<a id="pb307" href=
"#pb307" name="pb307">307]the good of mankind. They,
however, refused to do so. Vishnu then called for Siva, and asked him
to induce them to return. Siva brought a cow, and directed all the
K&#333;matis to get into its right ear. From there they saw gloriously
decorated towns, with magnificent temples, pleasure gardens, etc., and
begged permission to live in them. Siva assented, and they speedily
began to march off to their new abodes. But, almost immediately, a huge
conflagration came in view, and began to overwhelm them.
Terror-stricken, they cried out to Siva to help them in their trouble.
He consented on condition that they would return to the mortal world.
This they accordingly did. Siva gave them the name of G&#333;mati,
because they exhibited as much fear at the conflagration as a cow would
when anything untoward happened. Yet another derivation of K&#333;mati
is g&#333;-mati, meaning sprung from the cow in accordance with the
above legend, or cow-gored in reference to the story that the ancestors
of the K&#333;matis commingled in a cow-shed, where a pregnant woman
was gored by a cow. The derivation ku-mati, meaning evil-minded, is
grammatically impossible. The K&#333;matis are said to have originally
lived, and still live in large numbers on the banks of the
God&#257;vari river. One of the local names thereof is G&#333;mati or
G&#333;mti, and the Sanskrit G&#333;mati would, in Telugu, become
corrupted into K&#333;mati.
The K&#333;matis everywhere speak Telugu, and are devoted to their
mother-tongue. There is a common proverb among them, &ldquo;Telugu
th&#275;ta, Aravam adhv&#257;nam,&rdquo; meaning that Telugu is easy
(has an easy flow), and Tamil is wretched. &ldquo;Of all Dravidian
languages,&rdquo; Mr. Henry Morris writes, &ldquo;Telugu is the
sweetest and most musical. It is exceedingly mellifluous, and sounds
[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308]harmonious even in the mouth of the most vulgar
and illiterate. It has justly been called the Italian of the
East.&rdquo; K&#333;matis are clever at learning languages other than
their own. In the Tamil and Canarese districts, they are conversant
with the languages thereof, and in Bombay they speak Mar&#257;thi. In
the Ganjam and Vizagapatam Agencies, they speak the Kondh and Savara
languages very fluently.
As a commercial caste, the K&#333;matis have a secret trade language
of their own, which is substantially the same all over the country. It
will be seen from the tables given how complete their numerical tables
are, ranging, as they do, from one pie to a thousand rupees. It will be
observed that the rupee is represented by the word th&#275;lupu, which
means white. Some Tamil trading castes in like manner call the rupee
vell&#275; (white):&mdash;

A common saying is that, if you commence at g&#257;lam, it will be
settled at m&#363;lam, or, in plain language, begin at ten
var&#257;hams, and the bargain will be closed at five. When one man
says to another &ldquo;D&#333;tu&rdquo; or &ldquo;D&#333;tra,&rdquo; it
means strike the bargain. If a K&#333;mati is the purchaser, and
another says to him &ldquo;D&#333;t ko,&rdquo; it means take it.
The K&#333;matis are a highly organised caste. In each place where
they are settled there is a P&#275;dda Setti, who, among the Kalinga
K&#333;matis, is known as Puri Setti or S&#275;n&#257;pathi. Among the
latter, there is also a headman for several villages, who is styled
Kular&#257;ju or Vaisyar&#257;ju. Each P&#275;dda Setti is assisted by
a Mummadi Setti, who [<a id="pb310" href="#pb310"
name="pb310">310]assembles the castemen for the settlement
of important questions, by fines, excommunication, etc. There is
further a caste guru Bh&#257;skar&#257;ch&#257;rya, whose duties are
more religious than social. K&#333;matis have recourse to the
established Courts of Justice only as a last resort. They are consulted
by other castes in the settlement of their disputes, and it must be
said to their credit that their decisions are usually sound, and bear
ample testimony to the confidence which is placed in them.
The K&#333;matis are, broadly speaking, divided into two great
sections, called Gavara and Kalinga. The former live as far north of
Vizianagram, and are then replaced by the latter. The Gavaras or Gauras
are said to be so called because, by following the caste goddess
Kanyakamma into the fire-pits, they maintained the gauravam or social
status of the caste. According to another version, they are so called
because they revere Gauri (Parvati), the consort of Siva, whose
incarnation was the goddess Kanyakamma. The Kalinga K&#333;matis are
those who live in the old Kalinga or Kling country, which extended
roughly from Vizagapatam to Orissa. They are forbidden to settle beyond
R&#257;mat&#299;rtham, a place of pilgrimage close to Vizianagram. The
story goes that their ancestors lived at Padman&#257;bham, the hill
close to Bimlipatam, well known from the battle which took place close
to it in 1794, and there sustained great losses. Hence the place was
deserted, and has ever since been regarded as inauspicious. The
K&#333;matis have since that time not resided at any place from which
the hill can be seen. In fact, they make their first appearance at
Ch&#299;purupalli, and increase in numbers as we go north-eastward. The
Kalinga K&#333;matis believe themselves to be Gavara K&#333;matis, who
became separated from the main stock owing to their emigration from
their original [<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name=
"pb311">311]home. Their meat-eating habit has, they say,
widened the breach which separates the two divisions.
While the Kalinga K&#333;matis form a fairly compact division by
themselves, the Gavaras have become more and more sub-divided. Their
sub-divisions are either territorial, occupational, or religious in
character. Thus there are Penukonda and V&#275;gin&#257;du
K&#333;matis, of whom the former belong to the town of Penukonda in the
God&#257;vari district, and the latter to the V&#275;gi or V&#275;ngi
country, the former name of part of the modern Kistna district. Again,
there are Trinikas or Traivarnikas (third caste people), who are
invariably Vaishnavas, and to which section a good many of the
K&#333;matis in the city of Madras belong. Lingadh&#257;ri K&#333;matis
are found mostly in the Vizagapatam, God&#257;vari, Gunt&#363;r and
Kistna districts. They wear the lingam in a gold or silver casket.
Besides these, there are the Siva, Vaishnava, and M&#257;dhva
K&#333;matis, of which the last are mostly found in the Bellary
district. Of occupational sub-divisions, the following may be
noted:&mdash; N&#363;n&#275; (oil); N&#275;thi (gh&#299;, clarified
butter); D&#363;di (cotton); Uppu (salt); G&#333;n&#275; (gunny-bag);
Gantha (torn cloth). Lastly, there are other divisions, of which the
origin dates back to the time of Kanyakamma, the caste goddess. Thus,
there are those who entered the fire-pits with Kanyakamma, and those
who did not. The former are known as V&#275;gina, and the latter as
B&#275;ri, which is said to be a corruption of B&#275;dari, meaning
those who fled through fear. All Gavara K&#333;matis are said to be
descended from those who entered the fire-pits. The majority of the
K&#333;matis of the Sand&#363;r State, in the Bellary district, belong
to the Kallankanadavaru section, which is said to be descended from
those who sat on the stone (kallu) mantapa outside the Penukonda
Kanyakamma temple, [<a id="pb312" href="#pb312"
name="pb312">312]when the question whether to enter the
fire-pits or not was being discussed by the caste elders.
The mutual relations between the various sub-divisions vary much.
Broadly speaking, Gavaras and Kalingas do not intermarry, and the
objection to intermarriage is due to several causes. The former,
according to the caste Pur&#257;na, gave their lives to their goddess,
while the latter did not. Moreover, the former do not partake of animal
food and spirituous drinks, whereas the latter do. Lingadh&#257;ris and
ordinary Saivites intermarry, as also do Saivites and M&#257;dhvas.
Gavaras and Traivarnikas occasionally intermarry, but such marriages
are looked down upon. The Traivarnikas, like the Kalingas, eat animal
food. The occupational sub-divisions neither intermarry nor interdine.
Socially, the Gavaras are held in the highest esteem, while the Beris
are regarded as the lowest in the social scale.
The sub-divisions are split up into septs, which are of a strictly
exogamous character. That these originated in totemistic belief seems
to be supported by what remains of these beliefs at the present day.
All the sub-divisions contain such septs, which are very numerous, the
names of as many as a hundred and twenty having been collected. The
tendency for a long time past has been to reduce the number to a
hundred and two, to represent the number of families which followed
Kanyakamma to the fire-pits. It would be tedious to enumerate the names
of all these septs, from which the following, with the corresponding
totems, are selected:&mdash;

It may be observed that the totems are variously termed g&#333;tram,
vamsam, and kulam. The first of these is in imitation of the
Br&#257;hman g&#333;tras. Vamsam is the bams of the Agency tracts of
Ganjam, Vizagapatam, and the God&#257;vari districts. The name means
bamboo, and denotes a family, whose branches are as countless as those
of a bamboo. Kulam is used as the equivalent of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314" name=
"pb314">314]group or family. The totem objects are revered
in the usual way, and no secret is made of the reverence shown to them.
In regard to plant totems, it is stated that, if the totem objects are
not strictly treated as tabu, delinquents will be born as insects for
seven generations. But an exception is allowed. A person who wishes to
eat the forbidden plant may do so by annually performing the funeral
ceremonies of the totem ancestor at G&#257;ya, the great Hindu place of
pilgrimage where obsequial ceremonies to ancestors are performed.
In recent times, the K&#333;matis have claimed to be the Vaisyas
mentioned in the V&#275;dic Purusha-s&#363;kta. Accordingly, the totems
have been arranged under the different Br&#257;hmanical g&#333;tras,
whose pravaras have been appropriated. Thus, Munikula and four others
are grouped under Madgalya Rishi g&#333;tra, whose pravara is given for
all the five. Similarly, Vakk&#257;la kula and another kula come under
V&#257;yavya Rishi; Gh&#333;nta kula under Goupaka Rishi; Arati,
Arisishta and a few others under Atri Rishi; Anupa kula under Agasthya
Rishi, and so on. It is said that the totem names are secret names
(sank&#275;ta n&#257;mamulu) given by Kanyakamma, in order that the
bearers thereof may be distinguished from those who did not take up her
cause. All sub-divisions of the caste, however, have these septs in
common.
In the northern parts of the Madras Presidency, the sept is further
sub-divided into sections called intip&#275;rulu (house names). These
are either named after some distinguished ancestor, or the place where
the family once lived before emigrating to their present abode. These
intip&#275;rulu are purely exogamous.
A K&#333;mati can claim his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter in
marriage, in accordance with the custom of m&#275;narikam. The rigidity
with which this right is exercised is testified <span class=
"pagenum">[315]by
the sacred book of the caste&mdash;the Kanyak&#257; Pur&#257;na. On
their descent from heaven, it is said, the K&#333;matis settled in
eighteen towns (asht&#257; dasapuramulu), which had been built by
Visvakarma under the orders of Siva. These towns are said to be
situated in a tract of country sixty-four yojanas in extent, and
bounded on the east by the Gautami (God&#257;vari), on the south by the
sea, on the west by the G&#333;stani, and on the north by the Ganges.
Of these, Penukonda, in the modern God&#257;vari district, was the
capital. In it are the temples of Nagariswarasw&#257;mi (dedicated to
Siva), and Janardhanasw&#257;mi (dedicated to Vishnu). Its Pedda Setti
was Kusama Sr&#275;shti, and his wife was Kusam&#257;mba. He performed
Putra K&#257;m&#275;shti sacrifice, and was blessed with a son and
daughter. The former was named Virup&#257;ksha, and the latter
V&#257;sav&#257;mbika (V&#257;savakanya, Kanyakamma, or Kanyaka
Param&#275;swari). The girl was possessed of indescribable beauty.
Vishnu Vardhana, the son of Vijayarka of the lineage of the moon, who
had his capital at R&#257;jamundry, while on a pleasure tour round his
dominions, halted at Penugonda, on learning that it was ruled by Setti
R&#257;jas, who paid no tribute to him. Being informed of his arrival
by their boys, the caste elders, headed by Kusuma Setti, welcomed him,
and took him in procession through the town. Then the women of the
place waved &#257;rathi before him. Among them was the beautiful
V&#257;sav&#257;mbika, with whom the king instantly fell in love. He
proposed to her father that he should give her in marriage to himself,
and in return obtain the gift of half of his kingdom. Kusuma
Sr&#275;shti protested, and said that the s&#257;stras were against
such a union. The king, through his minister, threatened that he would
plunder his town, take him prisoner, and, with the riches of the place,
carry off his daughter, [<a id="pb316" href=
"#pb316" name="pb316">316]and marry her. The Setti chief and
his compatriots prayed for time to think over the matter, and retired.
The chief then called a meeting of the castemen, at which it was
decided that they should make a false promise to the king that they
would give the girl in marriage to him, and send him off with a dinner,
to return to Penugonda for the marriage after the lapse of a couple of
months. Meanwhile, the boys of the town assembled, and resolved that
the dinner ought not to be given. They informed their elders of this
resolution, and were commissioned to induce the king to leave the town
without it. This they did, with the ambiguous promise that, if they did
not give the girl in marriage to him, they would kill themselves. On
this, the king went off towards his capital, and Kusuma Setti called a
caste meeting of the eighteen towns, at which various proposals were
made. One proposed that the girl should not be given in marriage, and
that, if the king came to claim her hand, he should be driven off.
Another proposed that they should give the girl to the king, and save
themselves from ruin. Others suggested that it would be best to marry
the king to a substituted girl, to secrete the coveted girl, or to
bribe the ministers to induce the king to abandon his intention of
marrying her. The last of these proposals was adopted, and a few elders
were sent to R&#257;jamundry, to <span class="corr" id="xd21e4996"
title="Source: negociate">negotiate the affair. They first
argued that, though they promised to give the girl in marriage, the
promise was made through fear of the king&rsquo;s anger, and they could
not give the girl in contravention of the rule of m&#275;narikam. The
king, in his fury, ordered that the troops should immediately besiege
the eighteen towns, imprison the inhabitants in dark dungeons, and
carry off the girl in a palanquin. On this, the envoys heavily bribed
the ministers, and begged them [<a id="pb317"
href="#pb317" name="pb317">317]not to march the army on
their towns. But the king would not yield, and sent his troops on
Penugonda. The envoys returned home, and narrated their sad tale. A
further meeting of the castemen was called at the instance of
Bh&#257;skar&#257;ch&#257;rya,
the caste guru, and it was resolved that all who wished to maintain the
caste rule of m&#275;narikam should prepare to kill themselves in
burning fire-pits. The majority fled rather than comply with the
resolution. Those, however, who determined to sacrifice themselves in
the fire-pits were 102 g&#333;tras in number, and they assembled in
council, and asked Kusuma Sr&#275;shti to induce his daughter (who was
only seven years old) to die with them. To this she consented, and
showed herself in her true form of Param&#275;svari, the wife of Siva.
On this, the Setti chief returned to his castemen, who asked him to get
103 fire-pits ready in the western portion of the town before the
arrival of the king. These were accordingly dug, and decorated with
festoons and plantain trunks at the four corners. Then the heads of the
102 g&#333;tras assembled, with their wives, in the courtyard of the
temple of Nagar&#275;svarasw&#257;mi, where V&#257;sav&#257;mbika was
symbolically married to the god. The headmen then tied on v&#299;ra
kankanams (heroes&rsquo; wrist-threads), and marched in a body, with
V&#257;sav&#257;mbika, to the fire-pits. There they gave counsel to
their children that they should not ask v&#333;li (bride-price) for the
marriage of their daughters, or communicate their secrets to females,
or allow karnams (village accountants), rulers, unbelievers, or those
universally abused into their homes. They further counselled them to
give their daughters in marriage to the sons of their paternal aunts,
even though they should be black-skinned, plain, blind of one eye,
senseless, or of vicious habits, and though their horoscopes did not
agree, and [<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318]the omens were inauspicious. They were warned
that, if they failed in so doing, they would lose their riches, and
misfortune would fall on their families. Moreover, full power was given
to the castemen to excommunicate the delinquents, and put them outside
the town limits. If the transgressors subsequently repented, they were,
after the lapse of six months, to be sent to K&#257;si (Benares), bathe
in the Ganges, and return to their home. There they were to openly
express their regret for their past conduct, fast the whole day, feed
Br&#257;hmans, and present them with three hundred cows, and hear the
Mah&#257;bh&#257;ratha during the night. On the following day, they
were again to fast, present two hundred cows to Br&#257;hmans and feast
them, and hear the R&#257;mayana during the night. On the third day,
they were once more to fast, present a hundred cows, and hear the
Bh&#257;gavatam during the night. On the fourth day, they were again to
feast Br&#257;hmans, and worship Nagar&#275;svarasw&#257;mi of
Penugonda, and thus purge themselves from the sin of contravening the
rule of m&#275;narikam. But they were not bound to follow the rule, if
the paternal aunt&rsquo;s son was totally blind, deaf, insane, stricken
with disease, a eunuch, thief, idiot, leper, dwarf, or immoral, or if
an old man or younger than the girl. The children were further advised
to respect, at the time of their marriage, the families whose heads
went as envoys to the king at R&#257;jamundry, and the boys who made
false promises to the king, and induced him to withdraw to his capital.
The heads of the families then made various gifts to Br&#257;hmans, and
asked V&#257;sav&#257;mbika to enter the pit. In her true form of
Param&#275;svari, she blessed those g&#333;tras which had resolved to
follow her, and announced that those who had fled would be nameless and
without caste. She then declared that, immediately Vishnu <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319]Vardhana entered Penugonda, his head would fall
severed from his neck. Finally, she invoked Brahma not to create
thenceforth beautiful girls in the caste in which she was born, and
prayed that in future they should be short of stature, with gaping
mouth, disproportionate legs, broad ears, crooked hands, red hair,
sunken eyes, dilated eye-balls, insane looks, broad noses and wide
nostrils, hairy body, black skin, and protruding teeth. She then jumped
into her pit, and immediately afterwards the heads of the 102
g&#333;tras, with their wives, fell into their respective pits, and
were reduced to ashes. On the morrow, Vishnu Vardhana started on his
journey from R&#257;jamundry to Penugonda. Br&#257;hmans portended
evil, and a voice from heaven said that he would lose his life. An evil
spirit obstructed him, and it rained blood. Lightning struck men, and
numerous other signs of impending evil occurred. Arrived at Penugonda,
Vishnu Vardhana was informed that the castemen and
V&#257;sav&#257;mbika had been burnt in the fire-pits. Stunned by the
news, he fell from his elephant, and his head was severed from his
body, and broke into a thousand pieces. His broken head and body were
carried by his followers to R&#257;jamundry, and cremated by his son
R&#257;ja R&#257;ja Nar&#275;ndra. Then the latter pacified the
citizens of Penugonda, and appointed Virup&#257;ksha, the son of Kusuma
Sr&#275;shti, Pedda Setti of the towns. The 102 families performed
funeral rites for their dead parents, visited K&#257;si and
R&#257;m&#275;svaram, and built a temple in honour of
V&#257;sav&#257;mbika at Penugonda, in which they placed an image in
her name, and worshipped it ever afterwards.
Popular versions of the story here related from the Pur&#257;na are
told all over Southern India, where K&#333;matis live. One of the most
singular of these is narrated by [<a id="pb320"
href="#pb320" name="pb320">320]Bishop Whitehead.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5013src" href="#xd21e5013" name=
"xd21e5013src">139 &ldquo;The story,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;goes
that, in ancient days, there was a bitter hatred between the
K&#333;matis, who claim to belong to the Vaisya caste, and the Mlechas
or barbarians. When the K&#333;matis were getting worsted in the
struggle for supremacy, they requested Parvati, the wife of Siva, to
come and deliver them. It so happened that about that time Parvati was
incarnate as a girl of the K&#333;mati caste, who was exceedingly
beautiful. The Mlechas demanded that she should be given in marriage to
one of their own people, and the refusal of the K&#333;matis led to
severe fighting, in which the K&#333;matis, owing to the presence of
the avatar of Siva among them, were completely victorious, and almost
exterminated their enemies. After their victory, the K&#333;matis
entertained doubts as to the chastity of the girl, and compelled her to
purify herself by passing through fire. This she did, and disappeared
in the fire, resuming her real shape as Parvati, and taking her place
beside Siva in heaven. Her last words were a command to the
K&#333;matis to worship her, if they wished their caste to
prosper.&rdquo;

K&#333;mati.

It is impossible to identify with certainty the Vishnu Vardhana of
the Pur&#257;na. There are as many as eleven individuals of that name
known in Eastern Chalukyan history. The Pur&#257;na refers to Vishnu
Vardhana, the son of Vijayarka, who had his capital at R&#257;jamundry.
His son, according to the same authority, was R&#257;ja R&#257;ja
Nar&#275;ndra. According to the Mackenzie manuscripts, the town of
R&#257;jamundry was founded by a king named Vijay&#257;ditya
Mah&#275;ndra, who has not been identified. Dr. Fleet is of opinion
that Vishnu Vardhana VI, who ruled between 918 and 925 A.D., was the
first to [<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name=
"pb321">321]occupy, and re-name it. He, therefore, called
himself R&#257;jamah&#275;ndra. Amma II, who ruled between 945 and 970
A.D., bore the same title. His brother and successor was Danarnaya
(970&mdash;73 A.D.). Passing over the hiatus of thirty years, when the
country was in the hands of the Ch&#333;las, we come to the reign of
Saktivarman, the eldest son of Danarnaya. If we are to believe the
Kanyaka Pur&#257;na, then we must identify this Saktivarman with its
Vijayarka. Saktivarman&rsquo;s successor, according to inscriptions,
was Vimal&#257;ditya, who must be identified with the Vishnu Vardhana
of the Pur&#257;na. Vimal&#257;ditya&rsquo;s son, according to
inscriptions, was R&#257;ja R&#257;ja I, surnamed Vishnu Vardhana VIII.
He has been identified with the R&#257;ja R&#257;ja Nar&#275;ndra of
current tradition in the Telugu country, to whom Nannayya Bhatta
dedicated his translation of the Mah&#257;bh&#257;ratha. He must also
be the R&#257;ja R&#257;ja Nar&#275;ndra of the Pur&#257;na. If that is
so, we must set down the cardinal incidents mentioned in it to the
first quarter of the 11th century A.D. The actual spots where the
principal events of the tragedy were enacted are still pointed out at
Penugonda. Thus, the garden in which king Vishnu Vardhana halted is
said to be the site on which the hamlet of Vanampalli (meaning village
of gardens) stands at present. The spot where the huge fire-pit for
Kanyakamma was dug is pointed out as having been in field Nos. 63/3 and
63/4 to the north of the now non-existent Nagarasamudram tank. The 102
other pits were, it is said, in the fields round the bund (embankment)
of this tank. The tank is now under cultivation, but faint traces of
the bund are said to be still visible. It is about two furlongs to the
north-west of the temple of Nagar&#275;svarasw&#257;mi. It is locally
believed that Kanyakamma&rsquo;s fire-pit was, on the morning following
her tragic [<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322]end, found to contain, among the ashes, a golden
likeness of herself, which was placed by the side of the image of
Nagar&#275;swara, to whom she had been married. Long afterwards, the
golden image was removed, and one in stone substituted for it, in
accordance, it is said, with the direction of Kanyakamma, who appeared
to one of the townsmen in a dream.
The temple of Nagar&#275;svarasw&#257;mi has several inscriptions on
slabs, built into its pr&#257;k&#257;ra, and elsewhere. One of these is
on the gateway inside the pr&#257;k&#257;ra walls. It opens with a
glowing description of the powers of Nagar&#275;svarasw&#257;mi in
giving blessings and gifts, and refers to Penugonda as one of the
eighteen towns built by Visvakarma, and presented by Siva to the
K&#333;matis as a place of residence. The object of the inscription
appears to be to record the restoration by one Kothalinga, a
K&#333;mati whose genealogy is given, of the great town (Penugonda),
which had been burnt to ashes by a Gajapathi king. He is also stated to
have made grants of tanks, wells, and pleasure gardens, for the benefit
of Nagar&#275;svarasw&#257;mi, for whose daily offerings and the
celebration of festivals he provided by the grants of the villages of
Mummadi, Ninag&#275;p&#363;di, V&#257;ran&#257;si, K&#257;lkav&#275;ru,
and Mathamp&#363;di, all included in the town of Penugonda. Various
inscriptions show that, from so early a time as 1488 A.D., if not from
still earlier times, the temple had become popular with the
K&#333;matis, and got intertwined with the statements now found in the
Pur&#257;na. Rai Bah&#257;dur V. Venkayya, Government Epigraphist,
writes to say that the T&#275;ki plates found in the
R&#257;machandr&#257;puram taluk of the God&#257;vari district, and
published by Dr. E. Hultzsch,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5029src" href=
"#xd21e5029" name="xd21e5029src">140 may refer to some
K&#333;matis. The [<a id="pb323" href="#pb323"
name="pb323">323]edict contained in it was, according to Dr.
Hultzsch, probably issued about 1086 A.D., and records the grant of
certain honorary privileges on the descendants of a family of merchants
belonging to the Teliki family.
That about the end of the 14th century A.D., the story of Kanyakamma
was popular is obvious from the Telugu version of the Markand&#275;ya
Pur&#257;na, which was composed by the poet M&#257;rana, the disciple
of Tikkana, the part author of the Telugu Bh&#257;rata. In this
Pur&#257;na, the following episode, which bears a close resemblance to
the story narrated in the Kanyaka Pur&#257;na, is introduced. A king,
named Vrushadha, while on a hunting expedition, killed a cow, mistaking
it for a &ldquo;bison.&rdquo; He was cursed by Bh&#257;bhravya, the son
of a Rishi, who was in charge of it, and in consequence became a
S&#363;dra, by name Anaghak&#257;ra. He had seven sons, a descendant of
one of whom was N&#257;bh&#257;ga, who fell in love with a K&#333;mati
girl, and asked her parents to give her in marriage to him. The
K&#333;matis replied much in the same manner as Kusuma Sr&#275;shti and
his friends did to the ministers of Vishnu Vardhana in the Kanyaka
Pur&#257;na. Their answer will be found in canto VII, 223, of the
Markand&#275;ya Pur&#257;na, which contains the earliest authentic
literary reference to the name K&#333;mati. In effect they said
&ldquo;Thou art the ruler of the whole of this universe, Oh! King; we
are but poor K&#333;matis living by service. Say, then, how can we
contract such a marriage?&rdquo; The king was further dissuaded by his
father and the Br&#257;hmans. But all to no purpose. He carried off the
girl, and married her in the r&#257;kshasa form (by forcible
abduction), and, in consequence, in accordance with the law of Manu,
became a K&#333;mati. He then performed penance, and again became a
Kshatriya. It would seem that this episode, which is not found in the
[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324]Sanskrit Markand&#275;ya Pur&#257;na, is
undoubtedly based on the incident recorded in the Kanyaka
Pur&#257;na.
There remain only three arguments to adduce in support of the
suggestion that the chief event narrated in the Kanyaka Pur&#257;na is
worthy of credence. In the marriage ceremonies as performed by the
K&#333;matis, some prominence is given to certain of the incidents
alleged to have taken place in setting at naught the demands of king
Vishnu Vardhana. Such, for instance, is the respect shown to the
b&#257;la nagaram boys, which is referred to later on. Secondly, there
are certain castes which beg only from K&#333;matis, in return for
services rendered during this critical period of their history. These
are the Mail&#257;ris and V&#299;ramushtis. The former still carry
round the villages an image of Kanyakamma, sing her story, and beg alms
of devotees. The V&#299;ramushtis are wrestlers, who, by acrobatic
performances, delayed, by previous arrangement, the second advance of
Vishnu Vardhana, before the K&#333;matis committed themselves to the
flames. Allied to these castes are the Bukka K&#333;matis. Originally,
it is explained, the Bukkas belonged to the K&#333;mati caste. When
Kanyakamma threw herself into the fire-pit, they, instead of following
her example, presented bukka powder, saffron, and kunkumum prepared by
them to her. She directed that they should live apart from the faithful
K&#333;matis, and live by selling the articles which they offered to
her. The Kalinga K&#333;matis also have a beggar caste attached to
them, called Jakkali-v&#257;ndlu, who have nothing to do with the
Gavara K&#333;mati beggar castes. Thirdly, if we may place any faith in
the stories told by other castes, e.g., the Jains of South Arcot, the
Tottiyans, K&#257;ppiliyans, and B&#275;ri Chettis, the persecution of
their subjects by their kings, in the manner indicated in the Kanyaka
[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325]Pur&#257;na, seems to have been widely practiced
all over the country. And the method adopted by the K&#333;matis to
evade the king, and maintain the m&#275;narikam rule, has its
counterpart in the popular ballad known as Lakshmammapata, still sung
all over the Northern Circars, which gives a graphic description of the
murder of his wife by a husband, who would not agree to giving their
daughter away from his own sister&rsquo;s son. Even now, the sentiment
on this subject is so strong that a man who goes against the rule of
m&#275;narikam, not only among the K&#333;matis, but among all castes
observing it, is looked down on. It is usually described as bending the
twig from its natural course, and, as the twig would waste away and die
in consequence, so would parties to such marriages not prosper. In
1839, according to the Asiatic Journal, a case was taken before the
Supreme Court of Madras, in which the plaintiff brought an action
against his uncle for giving his daughter away in marriage, without
making him an offer of her hand. The Judges were anxious that the
matter should be settled out of Court, but the parties disagreed so
entirely that nothing less than a public trial would satisfy them. It
has not been possible to trace the decision of the Court.
The K&#333;matis have for a long time been alleged to be connected
with the M&#257;digas in a variety of ways. &ldquo;The
K&#333;matis,&rdquo; Mr. F. R. Hemingway writes, &ldquo;do not as a
rule deny the fact of this connection. The M&#257;digas are, indeed,
apparently under the protection of the K&#333;matis, apply to them for
help when in trouble, and obtain loans and other assistance. Some
K&#333;matis explain the connection with the M&#257;digas by a story
that either Vishnu Vardhana, or his successor R&#257;jar&#257;ja
Nar&#275;ndra persecuted the K&#333;matis, and that they had to fly for
refuge to the M&#257;digas. The M&#257;digas took them <span class=
"pagenum">[326]in,
and hid them, and they say that the present favour shown to that caste
is only in gratitude for the kindness shown to themselves in the past.
The K&#333;matis themselves do not admit the title Mid-day M&#257;digas
(applied to them by other castes), but explain it by a story that long
ago a K&#333;mati killed and ate a cow-buffalo, which was really no
cow-buffalo, but the wife of a great sage who had transformed her into
that shape in order that she might be safe when he was in
contemplation. The saint accordingly cursed the caste, and said that
they should be Mid-day M&#257;digas for ever more.&rdquo; It is
possible that the connection between the K&#333;matis and M&#257;digas
was originally such as that of the Kamm&#257;lans, Ambattans, and other
castes, with Paraiyans, Vettiyans, and other depressed classes, and
that, in later times, weird stories were invented by fertile brains to
explain them away. One of these undoubtedly is that which makes the
K&#333;matis the descendants of the issue of a plain Br&#257;hman and a
handsome M&#257;diga woman. It is said that their children managed a
sweetmeat bazar, which the Br&#257;hman kept in a much frequented
forest, and, in his absence, pointed with a stick (k&#333;l) to the
plates, and thereby told their prices, without polluting the articles
with the touch. Hence arose the name K&#333;lmutti (those who pointed
with the stick), which became softened down to K&#333;mutti. Another
story runs to the effect that the M&#257;diga woman, when she was
pregnant with her first child, was gored by a cow, and gave birth to it
in the cow-shed. Hence arises the name G&#333;-mutti, or cow-gored. In
days gone by, it was incumbent on the K&#333;matis to bear the marriage
expenses of the M&#257;diga families attached to their village, much in
the same way that the Chakkiliyan is treated in the Madura district by
the Tottiyan caste in return [<a id="pb327" href=
"#pb327" name="pb327">327]for the services he renders when a
Tottiyan girl is under pollution on reaching maturity. In later times,
this custom dwindled in some places<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5049src"
href="#xd21e5049" name="xd21e5049src">141 to the payment of the
expenses of the marriage of two M&#257;digas, and even this was
abandoned in favour of inviting the M&#257;digas to their weddings. In
the city of Madras, it would appear to have been customary, in the
eighteenth century, for the K&#333;matis to get the m&#257;ngalyam or
satham&#257;nam (marriage badge) blessed by an aged M&#257;diga before
it was tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck. Further, it would appear to have
then been customary to give the sacred fire, used at marriages for the
performance of h&#333;mam, to a M&#257;diga, and receive it back from
him.
These, and similar customs, traces of which still exist in some
places (e.g., North Arcot), show that the M&#257;diga has some
claim on the K&#333;matis. What that claim is is not clear. However, it
is reported that, if the M&#257;diga is not satisfied, he can
effectually put a stop to a marriage by coming to the house at which it
is to be celebrated, chopping away the plantain trunks which decorate
the marriage booth, and carrying them off. Similarly, Kamm&#257;lans
invite Vettiy&#257;ns (or Paraiyans) to their marriage, and, if this is
not done, there is the same right to cut down the plantain trunks. It
would seem that the right thus exercised has reference to the right to
the soil on which the booth stands. The cutting away of the plantain
shows that their right to stand there is not recognised. The invitation
to the M&#257;diga or Vettiy&#257;n would thus refer to the recognition
by the K&#333;matis and Kamm&#257;lans to the lordship of the soil held
in bygone days by these now depressed castes. Writing in 1869 and 1879,
respectively, Sir Walter Elliot and [<a id=
"pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328]Major J. S. F.
Mackenzie of the Mysore Commission refer<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5059src" href="#xd21e5059" name="xd21e5059src">142 to the
presentation of betel and nuts by the K&#333;matis to the M&#257;digas,
thereby inviting them to be present at their marriages. Dr. G. Oppert
also refers to the same custom.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5062src"
href="#xd21e5062" name="xd21e5062src">143 Having risen in the
social scale, the K&#333;matis would naturally wish to give this
invitation covertly. Major Mackenzie says that the K&#333;matis in
Mysore, in order to covertly invite the M&#257;digas to the wedding,
went to the back of their houses at a time when they were not likely to
be seen, and whispered into an iron vessel, such as is commonly used
for measuring grain, an invitation in the following
words:&mdash;&ldquo;In the house of the small ones (i.e.,
K&#333;matis) a marriage is going to take place. The members of the big
house (i.e., M&#257;digas) are to come.&rdquo; The M&#257;digas
look on such a secret invitation as an insult, and would, if they saw
the inviters, handle them roughly. It is noted, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, that &ldquo;now-a-days the presentation (of betel leaf
and nuts) is sometimes veiled by the K&#333;mati concerned sending his
shoes to be mended by the M&#257;diga a few days before the wedding,
deferring payment till the wedding day, and then handing the
M&#257;diga the leaf and nut with the amount of his bill.&rdquo;
According to another account, the K&#333;mati of set purpose unbinds
the toe-ring of his native shoes (ch&#275;rupu), and summons the
M&#257;diga, whose function it is to make and repair these articles of
attire. The M&#257;diga quietly accepts the job, and is paid more amply
than is perhaps necessary in the shape of p&#257;n-sup&#257;ri,
flowers, and money. On the acceptance by the M&#257;diga of the betel
and nuts, the K&#333;mati asks &ldquo;Ch&#275;rinda,
ch&#275;rinda&rdquo;? i.e., has it reached you, and the
M&#257;diga replies &ldquo;Ch&#275;rindi, ch&#275;rindi&rdquo;,
i.e., it has reached. [<a id="pb329" href=
"#pb329" name="pb329">329]Until he replies thus, the
m&#257;ngalyam cannot, it is said, be tied on the bride&rsquo;s neck.
In the Bellary district, betel leaf and nuts are usually left at night
behind the M&#257;diga&rsquo;s house, in token of the invitation to the
wedding. In the God&#257;vari district, according to Mr. Hemingway, the
K&#333;mati gives an order for a M&#257;diga for palmyra leaf baskets
before the marriage, and presents him with betel and nut when he brings
the baskets. Still another account says that some of the K&#333;matis,
just before a marriage, leave in the backyard of M&#257;diga houses a
few pice and betel close to the cattle-pen, and that it is whispered
that some K&#333;matis use chuckler&rsquo;s (leather-worker&rsquo;s)
tools, made in silver, for worship. It is also reported that
chuckler&rsquo;s work is pretended to be gone through by some
K&#333;matis, after the completion of the marriage ceremonies, in the
backyard of the house at dead of night, in the presence of caste-people
only, and by preference under a d&#257;nimma chettu (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Punica Granatum: pomegranate). This is known as
kul&#257;ch&#257;ram, kuladharmam, or g&#333;tra p&#363;ja (custom of
the caste, or worship of the g&#333;tras). The figure of a cow is made
of flour, and into its stomach they put a mixture of turmeric, lime,
and water, called w&#333;kali. This, it has been suggested, is meant to
represent blood. After the cow has been worshipped in due form, it is
cut up with instruments made of flour, and intended to represent those
used by cobblers. To each family is secretly sent that portion of the
cow, which, according to custom, they are entitled to receive. Thus,
the Kommala-v&#257;ru receive the horns, the Gontula the neck, the
Karakap&#257;la the hands and temples, the Thonti the hump, the Danta
the teeth, the Veligollu the white nails, and so on. Major Mackenzie
testified to the performance of this ceremony by the caste in Mysore in
1879, and it is recorded from [<a id="pb330"
href="#pb330" name="pb330">330]different parts of the Madras
Presidency. The flour, which is thus distributed, is known as
n&#275;p&#257;s&#257;ni mudda or n&#275;p&#257;s&#257;ni unta. The
ceremony is still performed in the city of Madras, on the night of the
fifth day if the marriage lasts over seven days, or on the night of the
third day if it lasts over five days. If the wedding ceremonies are
completed in one day, the ceremony is performed even during the day
time. The following details are performed. A brass vessel (kalasam) and
a cocoanut are set up in the house, and the bride and
bridegroom&rsquo;s parties arrange themselves on each side of it. The
vessel is decorated, and the cocoanut is made to represent the face of
a woman, with eyes, nose, mouth, etc., and adorned with jewelry,
flowers, anilin and turmeric powder marks. A young man of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s party worships the feet of all present. The flour
cow is then made, cut up, and distributed. Cocoanuts are broken, and
camphor is set on fire, and waved before the vessel. Mr. Muhammad
Ibrahim states that families are known by the names of the various
organs of the cow in the God&#257;vari district. There is, he says, a
story to the effect that some K&#333;matis killed a cow-buffalo, which
went about as such by day, but became transformed into a beautiful
woman under the miraculous influence of a pious Br&#257;hman. As a
redemption for their sin, these K&#333;matis were ordered by the
Br&#257;hman to take their names after the various parts of the animal,
and as, by killing the animal, they proved worse than M&#257;digas,
they were ordered to show respect to these people. In the Kumbum
t&#257;luk of the Kurnool district, a flour buffalo is substituted for
the cow. In the Markap&#363;r t&#257;luk of the same district, two
elephants are made of mud, and the bride and bridegroom sit beside
them. Presentations of cloths and jewels are then made to them. The
officiating [<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331]pur&#333;hit (priest) worships the elephants,
and the bride and bridegroom go round them.
Two further points of connection between the K&#333;matis and
M&#257;digas are referred to by Major Mackenzie. &ldquo;I find,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;that it is the custom to obtain the fire for burning
K&#257;ma, the Indian Cupid, at the end of the H&#333;li feast from a
M&#257;diga&rsquo;s house. The M&#257;digas do not object to giving the
fire, in fact they are paid for it.&rdquo; This appears to be a purely
local custom, and no trace of its existence has been found in various
parts of the Madras Presidency. The other point refers to the
identification of the goddess M&#257;tangi of the M&#257;digas with the
K&#333;mati goddess Kanyaka Amma. &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; Major
Mackenzie writes, &ldquo;discover the connection between two such
different castes as the K&#333;matis and M&#257;digas, who belong to
different divisions. The K&#333;matis belong to the 10 pana division,
while the M&#257;digas are members of the 9 pana.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5090src" href="#xd21e5090" name="xd21e5090src">144 One reason
has been suggested. The caste goddess of the K&#333;matis is the virgin
Kannika Amma, who destroyed herself rather than marry a prince, because
he was of another caste. She is usually represented by a vessel full of
water, and, before the marriage ceremonies are commenced, she is
brought in state from the temple, and placed in the seat of honour in
the house. The M&#257;digas claim Kannika as their goddess, worship her
under the name of M&#257;tangi and object to the K&#333;matis taking
their goddess.&rdquo; The K&#333;matis stoutly deny that there is any
connection between M&#257;tangi and Kanyaka Amma, and it would seem
that they are independent goddesses.
Marriage is always infant. A Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit officiates.
Each pur&#333;hit has a number of houses attached <span class=
"pagenum">[332]to
his circle, and his sons usually divide the circle among themselves on
partition, like any other property. Polygamy is permitted, but only if
the first wife produces no offspring. The taking of a second wife is
assented to by the first wife, who, in some cases, believes that, as
the result of the second marriage, she herself will beget children. Two
forms of marriage ceremonial are recognised, one called
pur&#257;n&#333;ktha, according to long established custom, and the
other called v&#275;d&#333;ktha, which follows the V&#275;dic ritual of
Br&#257;hmans. In Madras, on the first day of a marriage, the
contracting couple have an oil bath, and the bridegroom goes through
the upanayana (sacred thread investiture) ceremony. He then pretends to
go off to K&#257;si (Benares), and is met by the bride&rsquo;s party,
who take him to the bride&rsquo;s house, where the m&#257;ngalyam is
tied by the bridegroom before the h&#333;mam (sacrificial fire). On the
second day, h&#333;mam is continued, and a caste dinner is given. On
the third day, the g&#333;tra p&#363;ja is performed. On the fourth
day, h&#333;mam is repeated, and, on the following day, the pair are
seated on a swing, and rocked to and fro. Presents, called katnam, are
made to the bridegroom, but no v&#333;li (bride-price) is paid. In the
mofussil,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5097src" href="#xd21e5097" name=
"xd21e5097src">145 where the pur&#257;n&#333;ktha form of
ceremonial is more common, ancestors are invoked on the first day. On
the second day, the ashtavarga is observed, and the bride and
bridegroom worship eight of the principal gods of the Hindu Pantheon.
On this day, the pandal (marriage booth) is erected. On the third day,
the m&#257;ngalyam is tied, sometimes by the officiating Br&#257;hman
pur&#333;hit, and sometimes by the bridegroom. On the fourth day, the
Br&#257;hmans of the place are honoured, and, on the following
[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333" name=
"pb333">333]day, in most places, a festival is held in
honour of the goddess Kanyaka Param&#275;swari. The bride and
bridegroom&rsquo;s mothers go to a tank (pond) or river with copper
vessels, and bring back water at the head of a procession. The vessels
are placed in a special pandal, and worshipped with flowers, anilin and
turmeric powders. Finally, cocoanuts are broken before them. On the
next day, or on the same day if the marriage ceremonies conclude
thereon, the festival in honour of the B&#257;lanagaram boys, or those
who helped the K&#333;matis of Penugonda in their trouble with Vishnu
Vardhana, is held. Five boys and girls are bathed, decked with jewelry,
and taken in procession to the local temple, whence they are conducted
to the bride&rsquo;s house, where they are fed. On the following day,
the ceremony called thotlu p&#363;ja is performed. A doll is placed in
a cradle connected with two poles, and rocked to and fro. The
bridegroom gives the doll into the hands of the bride, saying that he
has to go on a commercial trip. The bride hands it back to him, with
the remark that she has to attend to her kitchen work. On the following
day, the bridal couple are taken in procession, and, in the Bellary
district, a further day is devoted to the surgi ceremony. The bride and
bridegroom bathe together, go to the local temple, and return. Then
five girls bathe, the five posts of the marriage pandal are worshipped,
and the kankanams (wrist-threads) are removed from the wrists of the
newly-married couple.
Kalinga K&#333;matis, who live in the northern part of Ganjam, and
have forgotten their mother-tongue, have practically adopted the Oriya
customs, as they have to depend mainly on Oriya Br&#257;hmans. At their
marriages, however, they use the Telugu bottu or satham&#257;nam.
[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334]
Widow remarriage is not permitted among any sections of the caste,
which is very strict in the observance of this rule. Except among the
Saivites, a widow is not compelled to have her head shaved, or give up
wearing jewelry, or the use of betel. In the south of the Madras
Presidency, if a little girl becomes a widow, her m&#257;ngalyam is not
removed, and her head is not shaved till she reaches maturity.
Vaishnava widows always retain their hair.
Concerning a form of marriage between the living and the dead,
performed by members of this caste if a man and woman have been living
together, and the man dies, Mr. Hutchinson writes as follows.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5109src" href="#xd21e5109" name=
"xd21e5109src">146 &ldquo;The sad intelligence of her man&rsquo;s
death is communicated to her neighbours, a guru or priest is summoned,
and the ceremony takes place. According to a writer who once witnessed
such a proceeding, the dead body of the man was placed against the
outer wall of the verandah of the house in a sitting posture, attired
like a bridegroom, and the face and hands besmeared with turmeric. The
woman was clothed like a bride, and adorned with the usual tinsel
ornament over the face, which, as well as the arms, was daubed over
with yellow. She sat opposite the dead body, and spoke to it in light
unmeaning words, and then chewed bits of dry cocoanuts, and squirted
them on the face of the dead man. This continued for hours, and not
till near sunset was the ceremony brought to a close. Then the head of
the corpse was bathed, and covered with a cloth of silk, the face
rubbed over with some red powder, and betel leaves placed in the mouth.
Now she might consider herself married, and the funeral procession
started.&rdquo; This refers to [<a id="pb335"
href="#pb335" name="pb335">335]the V&#299;ra Saiva or
Ling&#257;yat K&#333;matis of the Northern Circars.
In the Northern Circars, and part of the Ceded Districts, the
V&#275;d&#333;ktha form of marriage now prevails, and its usage is
spreading into the southern districts of Mysore. Further, the
K&#333;matis perform most of their ceremonies in the same form. This,
it is contended, is a latter day development by some of the more
conservative members of the caste, but it is stated by those who follow
it that it is allowed to them by the Hindu s&#257;stras (law books), as
they are Vaisyas. During recent years, the latter view has obtained a
great impetus through the writings and influence of several of the more
prominent members of the caste, between whom and their opponents a war
of pamphlets has taken place. It is not possible here to go into
details of the dispute, but the main point seems to be as follows. On
the one hand, it is denied that there are any true Vaisyas in the
Kaliyuga (iron age). And so, though the K&#333;matis are accorded the
status of Vaisyas in recognition of their being traders, yet they
cannot follow the V&#275;dic form of ceremonial, which is the exclusive
right of Br&#257;hmans; and, even if they ever followed it, they
forfeited it after the break-up of the caste on the death of
Kanyakamma. On the other hand, it is stated that the K&#333;matis are
Dwijas (twice born), and that they are consequently entitled to follow
the V&#275;dic ritual, and that those who forfeited the V&#275;dic
rights are those who did not follow Kanyakamma to the fire-pits, and do
not therefore belong to the 102 g&#333;tras. The dispute is an old
standing one, and nearly a century ago was taken for adjudication as
far as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The question
whether the K&#333;matis are entitled to perform their subah and asubah
(auspicious, like marriage, and inauspicious, <span class=
"pagenum">[336]like
death) ceremonies according to the V&#275;dic form, was raised by the
Br&#257;hmans of Masulipatam in 1817, and adjudicated upon.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5118src" href="#xd21e5118" name=
"xd21e5118src">147 Disputes had occurred between the Br&#257;hmans
and K&#333;matis for a long time, and disturbances constantly took
place. The Magistrate of Masulipatam prohibited the K&#333;matis from
performing one of the ceremonies, until they had established their
right to do so in a Civil Court. The appellants thereon sued the
defendants in damages for impediments made against their attending to
the rites prescribed by the V&#275;das, and prayed for permission to
perform them in conformity with the V&#275;das. The defendants denied
the right of the K&#333;matis to perform, and the fact of their ever
having performed the ceremonies appointed by the V&#275;das. They
admitted the intervention of the Magistrate, and stated that
&ldquo;upwards of two thousand years ago, the K&#333;matis adopted the
customs of the Soodra caste, and some of them became Byri K&#333;matis,
and Bookha caste people, etc. The rest of them, amounting to a hundred
and two g&#333;tras, fabricated false g&#333;trams for themselves, and
called themselves Nagaram K&#333;matis. They fabricated a book called
Canniaca Pur&#257;nam, named the Bashcara Puntulu Varu their priest,
conformed to that book, performed the sign of the upanayana ceremony in
a loose manner, and in the language of the Pur&#257;nas; at the time of
marriage, made marriage ceremony in seven days contrary to the custom
of all castes whatever, erected pr&#333;lu posts, made lumps of dough
with flour, and got the same divided among them according to their
spurious g&#333;trams, at midnight fetched the pot of water called
arivany, and observed the ceremonies for ten days on the occurrence of
a birth, and fifteen days on [<a id="pb337" href=
"#pb337" name="pb337">337]the occurrence of a death. In this
manner, the forefathers of the plaintiffs, the other merchants, and the
plaintiffs themselves, had got all ceremonies conducted for upwards of
two thousand years past.&rdquo; They cited instances, in which the
plaintiffs, or some of them, had failed in previous attempts to sustain
the right now claimed, and objected to the form of the plaint as not
sufficiently setting forth the particulars and nature of the
obstruction for which the plaintiffs claimed compensation. The
plaintiffs, in their reply, did not negative or rebut the specific
statements of the defendants, but insisted generally on their right to
the performance of the ceremonies in question. The point at issue being
not clear from the pleadings, the parties were questioned in open Court
as to the precise object of the action, and the ground on which it was
maintained. The plaintiffs stated that their object was the
establishment of their right to have the whole of the subha and asubha
ceremonies performed in their houses by Br&#257;hmans in the language
of the V&#275;das, and that they claimed this right on the ground of
the S&#257;stras. On this, the Zilla Judge framed a hypothetical
statement of facts and law based on the defendant&rsquo;s answer for
the opinion of the Pandit of the Court, and, upon his opinion, declared
the plaintiffs entitled to have the ceremonies performed for them by
Br&#257;hmans. Upon appeal, the Provincial Court for the northern
division remitted the suit to the Zilla Court to take evidence, and,
upon such opinions of the Pandits which the Provincial Court took upon
the same statement as the Zilla, they affirmed the decree, but without
costs. The Pandits consulted by them were those of the Provincial
Courts of the northern, centre, southern and western divisions. They
all agreed that &ldquo;the Br&#257;hmans ought not to perform the
ceremonies in the language of [<a id="pb338"
href="#pb338" name="pb338">338]the V&#257;das for the
Vaisyas.&rdquo; Three of them further added that, in their opinion, the
Judges ought to pass a decision, awarding that the K&#333;matis are to
continue to perform religious rites according to the rules laid down in
the book called Pur&#257;nam (i.e., in the Pur&#257;n&#333;ktha
form), as are at present observed by the corrupt or degenerate Vaisyas
or K&#333;matis and others. On appeal, the Sudder Dew&#257;ni Adawlut
reversed the decisions of the lower Courts, &ldquo;having maturely
weighed the evidence produced, and considered the unbiassed and
concurring opinions of the four law officers of the Provincial
Courts.&rdquo; On further appeal to the Privy Council, Lord Brougham,
in delivering judgment, observed that &ldquo;the plaintiffs, not
having, in their opinion, alleged any case of injury done to them by
the defendants upon which they were entitled to go into evidence, and
not having therefore established any case for damages in their suit
against the defendants, no question remained but of a mere declaration
of a right to perform certain religious ceremonies; that, if the Courts
had jurisdiction to proceed to the determination of that question in
this suit (upon which their Lordships guard themselves in their
judgment), the plaintiffs have not produced sufficient evidence to
establish such a right; that, under these circumstances, all the
decrees therefore ought to be reversed, and the plaint dismissed (the
reversal of the Sudder Court amounts in fact to a dismissal of the
plaint); but it is not, as it ought to be, a dismissal without costs;
and that this decision should be without prejudice to the existence or
non-existence of the right claimed by the appellants, in any other
suit, in which such a question may be properly raised.&rdquo;
The K&#333;matis wear the sacred thread, and utter the G&#257;yatri
and other sacred mantras. A number of them, <span class=
"pagenum">[339]at
Ad&#333;ni in the Bellary district, refused to be measured by me in the
afternoon, as they would not have time to bathe, and remove the
pollution by evening. In Telugu dictionaries, the K&#333;matis are
given the alternative names of M&#363;dava Kolamuv&#257;ru (those of
the third caste), Vaisyalu, and Nallanayya Todabiddalu (those who were
begotten from the thighs of Vishnu). As already stated, there are among
the K&#333;matis ordinary Saivites, who daub themselves with ashes;
Ling&#257;yats or V&#299;ra Saivas, who wear the linga in a silver
casket; R&#257;m&#257;nuja Vaishnavites; Chaitanya Vaishnavas, who are
confined to the Kalinga section; and M&#257;dhvas, who put on the sect
marks of M&#257;dhva Br&#257;hmans. The Traivarnikas are a special
class among the Vaishnavas. They imitate the Vaishnava Br&#257;hmans
more closely than the rest. They, and their females, tie their cloths
like Br&#257;hmans, and the men shave moustaches. Unlike the Saivites
and Ling&#257;yats, they eat flesh and fish, and drink spirituous
liquors. They will eat in the houses of S&#257;t&#257;nis, whereas
other K&#333;matis do not eat in any but Br&#257;hman houses. But it
may be observed that Velamas, Balijas, Kamm&#257;lans, Ambattans,
Vann&#257;ns, and many other castes, will take neither water nor food
from K&#333;matis. This, however, does not prevent them from purchasing
the cakes prepared in gh&#299; or oil, which the K&#333;matis sell in
petty shops.
Writing early in the nineteenth century, Buchanan refers <a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5134src" href="#xd21e5134" name=
"xd21e5134src">148 to a dispute at Gubbi in the Mysore State
between the K&#333;matis and Banajigas, which arose from the former
building a temple to their goddess Kanyakamma. Purnia, the
Prime-minister, divided the town by a wall, thus separating the two
parties. The K&#333;matis [<a id="pb340" href=
"#pb340" name="pb340">340]claimed that it had been the
custom for all parties to live together, and that it would be an
infringement of the rules of caste for them to be forced into a
separate quarter. The chief of the K&#333;matis entered the town in
procession, on horseback with an umbrella held over his head. This
assumption of rank was regarded by the Banajigas with the utmost
indignation. To such a pitch did the quarrel reach that, at the time of
Buchanan&rsquo;s visit, there was a rumour current as to the necessity
of killing a jack-ass in the street, which would cause the immediate
desolation of the place. &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;not
a Hindu in Karnata, that would remain another night in it, unless by
compulsion. Even the adversaries of the party would think themselves
bound in honour to fly. This singular custom seems to be one of the
resources upon which the natives have fallen to resist arbitrary
oppression, and may be had recourse to whenever the Government
infringes, or is considered to have infringed upon the custom of any
caste. It is of no avail against any other kind of
oppression.&rdquo;
A brief reference may be made to the part which the K&#333;matis
took, in bygone days, in the faction fights known as right and
left-hand caste disputes. Some of the South Indian castes, including
the K&#333;matis, belong to the former, and others to the latter. Those
belonging to the left-hand would not let those belonging to the
right-hand pass through their streets with their marriage and other
processions. The right-hand section was equally jealous of the left.
The K&#333;matis, who were among the early settlers in the town of
Madras in the seventeenth century, were involved in faction disputes on
two recorded occasions, once, in 1652 A.D., during the Governorship of
Aaron Baker, and later on during that [<a id=
"pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341]of William
Pitt,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5144src" href="#xd21e5144" name=
"xd21e5144src">149 in 1707. When a wedding procession of members of
one section passed through the streets of the other section, Pitt
summoned twelve of the heads of each section, and locked them up in a
room together, until the dispute should be adjusted. An agreement was
speedily arrived at, according to which the right-hand settled on the
west side of the town, now known as Pedda Naikan Pettah, and the
left-hand on the east side, in what is at present called Mutialu
Pettah. The K&#333;matis accordingly are now mainly found in the
western part of the city of Madras.
All over the country, the K&#333;matis venerate the deified virgin
Kannika Param&#275;swari, to whom, in most places, they have erected
temples. One of these, at Tadpatri in the Anantap&#363;r district,
which was in course of construction in 1904, is of more than ordinary
interest. It was being built at the expense of the local K&#333;matis,
who had raised a subscription among themselves for the purpose. The
design was original, and even arches entered into its construction. The
sculpture, with which it is decorated, is quite excellent in design and
finish. Much of it is copied from the two beautiful temples, which have
existed at the place since the days of the Vijianagar dynasty. Other
notable temples are those at Penukonda, Vizianagram in Vizagapatam, and
Berhampur in Ganjam. Fines collected from erring castemen in the
God&#257;vari, Gunt&#363;r and Kistna districts, are still sent to the
temple at Penukonda. The K&#333;matis worship various goddesses, in
addition to Kanyaka Param&#275;swari. Those who live in Vizagapatam
&ldquo;relax their faith in favour of the celebrated Muhammadan saint,
who lies buried by the Durga on the top of the hill which overlooks
[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342]the harbour. Every vessel, passing the harbour
inwards and outwards, salutes him by hoisting and lowering its flag
three times. He is considered all potent over the elements in the Bay
of Bengal, and many a silver dhoney (boat) is presented at his shrine
by Hindu ship-owners after a successful voyage. We remember a suit
between a K&#333;mati, the owner of a dhoney, and his Muhammadan
captain, who was also the super-cargo, for settlement of accounts. In a
storm off the coast of Arakan, the skipper stated that he had vowed a
mudupu or purse of rupees to the Durga, and had duly presented it on
his return. This sum, among other sets-off, he charged to the owner of
the vessel, the plaintiff, whose sole contention was that the vow had
never been discharged; the propriety of conciliating the old Fakir in a
hurricane he submissively allowed.&rdquo; Even now, the K&#333;matis,
though no longer boat-owners, revere the saint, and make vows to him
for the success of civil suits, and recovery from all sorts of
maladies.
The K&#333;matis employ Br&#257;hmans for the performance of their
ceremonial rites, and recognise a Br&#257;hman as their guru. He is
commonly called Bh&#257;skar&#257;ch&#257;rya, after the individual of
that name who lived at Penukonda prior to the sixteenth century A.D.,
and translated the Sanskrit Kanyaka Pur&#257;na into a Telugu poem. He
made certain regulations for the daily conduct of the K&#333;matis, and
made the 102 g&#333;tras submit to them. A copy of an inscription on a
copper plate, in the possession of one Kotta Appaya, the Archaka or
priest of the Nagar&#275;swarasw&#257;mi temple at Penukonda, is given
in the Mackenzie manuscripts. It records a grant (of unknown date) to
Bh&#257;skar&#257;ch&#257;rya, the guru of the Vaisyas, by the 102
g&#333;trams, according to which each family agreed for ever afterwards
to give half a rupee for every marriage, [<a id=
"pb343" href="#pb343" name="pb343">343]and a quarter of a
rupee for each year. Such doles are common even at the present day to
his successors. These, like the original Bh&#257;skar&#257;ch&#257;rya,
who is considered to be an incarnation of Brahma, are house-holders,
and not Sany&#257;sis (religious ascetics). There are several of them,
in different parts of the country, one for example being at Penukonda,
and another near Hospet, who makes periodical tours in state, with
drums, silver maces, and belted peons, and is received with every mark
of respect. He settles disputes, levies fines, and collects
subscriptions towards the upkeep of his mutt (religious institution),
which is also supported by in&#257;m (rent-free) lands.
The K&#333;mati dead, except children and Ling&#257;yats, are
cremated, Ling&#257;yat K&#333;matis, like other Ling&#257;yats, bury
their dead in a sitting posture. The death ceremonies among the Gavaras
closely resemble those of Br&#257;hmans. The period of death pollution
is sixteen days, during which sweets are taboo.
The K&#333;matis are best known as merchants, grocers, and
money-lenders. In the city of Madras, they are the principal vendors of
all sorts of imported articles. The row of shops in the China bazar,
between Pachaiyappa&rsquo;s College and Popham&rsquo;s Broadway, is
almost entirely maintained by them. Many K&#333;matis are cloth
merchants, and Traivarnikas are almost entirely engaged in the
glassware trade. In the Northern Circars, some earn a living as petty
dealers in opium and ganja (Indian hemp). In the Ganjam, Vizagapatam
and God&#257;vari districts they are found in the hills, acting as
middle-men between the hill tribes and the people of the plains. Most
of the K&#333;matis are literate, and this helps them in their dealings
with their constituents. They are proverbially shrewd, industrious, and
thrifty, and are often rich. [<a id="pb344" href=
"#pb344" name="pb344">344]If a K&#333;mati fails in
business, his compatriots will come to his rescue, and give him a fresh
start. Organised charity is well known among them. Each temple of
Kanyaka Param&#275;swari is a centre for charity. In the city of Madras
the Kanyaka Param&#275;swari charities, among other good objects,
promote the development of female education. In 1905, the K&#333;matis
established a Southern India Vysia Association, with the object of
encouraging &ldquo;the intellectual, moral, religious, social,
industrial and commercial advancement of the Vysia community.&rdquo;
Among the means employed for so doing, are the helping of deserving
students with scholarships for the prosecution of the study of the
English and vernacular languages, and organised relief of poor and
distressed members of the community by founding orphanages, and so
forth. The affairs of the association are managed by an executive
committee made up of prominent members of the caste, including
merchants, lawyers, and contractors.
Many stories and proverbs have reference to the wealth, ready wit,
thrift, and other qualities of the K&#333;matis.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5165src" href="#xd21e5165" name="xd21e5165src">150 Of these,
the following are selected from a large repertoire:&mdash;
The Blind K&#333;mati and Vishnu.
A blind K&#333;mati prayed to Vishnu for the restoration of his
eyesight, and at last the god appeared before him, and asked him what
he wanted. &ldquo;Oh! God,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I want to see from
above the seventh storey of my mansion my great-grandsons playing in
the streets, and eating their cakes from golden vessels.&rdquo;
Vishnu was so astonished at the request of the blind man, which
combined riches, issue, and the restoration <span class=
"pagenum">[345]of
his eyesight in one demand, that he granted all his desires.
The K&#333;mati and the Thief.
An old K&#333;mati observed a thief at dead of night lurking under a
pomegranate tree, and cried out to his wife to bring him a low stool.
On this he seated himself in front of the thief, and bawled out for hot
water, which his wife brought him. Pretending that he was suffering
from severe tooth-ache, he gargled the water, and spat it out
continuously at the wondering thief. This went on till daybreak, when
he called out his neighbours, who captured the thief, and handed him
over to the police.
The K&#333;mati and his Cakes.
A K&#333;mati was on his way to the weekly market, with his plate of
cakes to sell there. A couple of thieves met him when he was half way
there, and, after giving him a severe thrashing, walked off with the
cakes. The discomfited K&#333;mati, on his way back home with the empty
plate, was met by another K&#333;mati going to market with his cakes.
The latter asked how the demand for cakes was at the market, and the
former replied &ldquo;Why go to the market, when half-way people come
and demand your cakes?&rdquo; and passed on. The unsuspecting
K&#333;mati went on, and, like the other, was the recipient of a sound
thrashing at the hands of the thieves.
The K&#333;mati and the Scorpion.
A number of K&#333;matis went one day to a temple. One of them put
one of his fingers into the navel of the image of Vin&#257;yakan (the
elephant god) at the gateway, when a scorpion, which was inside it,
stung him. Putting his finger to his nose, the K&#333;mati remarked
&ldquo;What [<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346]a fine smell! I have never experienced the
like.&rdquo; This induced another man to put his finger in, and he too
was stung, and made similar pretence. All of them were thus stung in
succession, and then consoled each other.
The K&#333;mati and the Milk Tax.
Once upon a time, a great king levied a tax upon milk, and all his
subjects were sorely tried by it. The K&#333;matis, who kept cows,
found the tax specially inconvenient. They, therefore, bribed the
minister, and mustered in strength before the king, to whom they spoke
concerning the oppressive nature of the tax. The king asked what their
profit from the milk was. &ldquo;A pie for a pie&rdquo; said they to a
man, and the king, thinking that persons who profit only a pie ought
not to be troubled, forthwith passed orders for the abolition of the
tax.
The K&#333;mati and the P&#257;ndyan King.
Once upon a time, a P&#257;ndyan King had a silver vessel of
enormous size made for the use of the palace, and superstitiously
believed that its first contents should not be of an ordinary kind. So
he ordered his minister to publish abroad that all his subjects were to
put into the vessel a chembu-full of milk from each house. The frugal
K&#333;matis, hearing of this, thought, each to himself, that, as the
king had ordered such a large quantity, and others would bring milk, it
would suffice if they took a chembu-full of water, as a little water
poured into such a large quantity of milk would not change its colour,
and it would not be known that they only contributed water. All the
K&#333;matis accordingly each brought a chembu-full of water, and none
of them told the others of the trick he was about to play. But it so
happened that the K&#333;matis were the first to enter the palace,
while they [<a id="pb347" href="#pb347" name=
"pb347">347]thought that the people of other castes had come
and gone. The vessel was placed behind a screen, so that no one might
cast the evil eye on it, and the K&#333;matis were let in one by one.
This they did in all haste, and left with great joy at the success of
their trick. Thus there was nothing but water in the vessel. Now it had
been arranged that the king was to be the first person to see the
contents of his new vessel, and he was thunderstruck to find that it
contained only water. He ordered his minister to punish the
K&#333;matis severely. But the ready-witted K&#333;matis came forward,
and said &ldquo;Oh! gracious King, appease thy anger, and kindly listen
to what we have to say. We each brought a chembu-full of water, to find
out how much the precious vessel will hold. Now that we have taken the
measurement, we will forthwith fetch the quantity of milk
required.&rdquo; The king was exceedingly pleased, and sent them
away.
A story is told to the effect that, when a K&#333;mati was asked to
identify a horse about which a Muhammadan and Hindu were quarrelling,
he said that the fore-part looked like the Muhammadan&rsquo;s, and the
hind-part like the Hindu&rsquo;s. Another story is told of a
K&#333;mati, who when asked by a Judge what he knew about a fight
between two men, deposed that he saw them standing in front of each
other and speaking in angry tones when a dust-storm arose. He shut his
eyes, and the sound of blows reached his ears, but he could not say
which of the men beat the other.
Of proverbs relating to the K&#333;matis, the following may be
noted:&mdash;

A Br&#257;hman will learn if he suffers, and a
K&#333;mati will learn if he is ruined.
If I ask whether you have salt, you say that you have dhol (a kind
of pulse). [<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348]
Like the burning of a K&#333;mati&rsquo;s house, which would mean a
heavy loss.
When two K&#333;matis whisper on the other side of the lake, you
will hear them on this side. This has reference to the harsh voice of
the K&#333;matis. In native theatricals, the K&#333;mati is a general
favourite with the audience, and he is usually represented as short of
stature, obese, and with a raucous voice.
The K&#333;mati that suits the stake. This has reference to a story
in which a K&#333;mati&rsquo;s stoutness, brought on by want of
exercise and sedentary habits, is said to have shown that he was the
proper person to be impaled on a stake. According to the Rev. H.
Jensen,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5231src" href="#xd21e5231" name=
"xd21e5231src">151 the proverb refers to an incident that took
place in &lsquo;the city of injustice.&rsquo; A certain man was to be
impaled for a crime, but, at the last moment he pointed out that a
certain fat merchant (K&#333;mati) would be better suited for the
instrument of punishment, and so escaped. The proverb is now used of a
person who is forced to suffer for the faults of others.

The K&#333;matis are satirically named Dhaniy&#257;la j&#257;ti, or
coriander caste, because, as the coriander seed has to be crushed
before it is sown, so the K&#333;mati is supposed to come to terms only
by rough treatment.
The K&#333;matis have the title Setti or Chetti, which is said to be
a contracted form of Sr&#275;shti, meaning a precious person. In recent
times, some of them have assumed the title Ayya.
Kombara.&mdash;The name, meaning a cap made of the spathe of
the areca palm (Areca Catechu) of an exogamous sept of Kelasi.
Such caps are worn by various classes in South Canara, e.g., the
Holeyas and Koragas. [<a id="pb349" href="#pb349"
name="pb349">349]
Kombu (stick).&mdash;An exogamous sept of Kuruba.
Komma.&mdash;Komma (a musical horn) or Kommula has been
recorded as an exogamous sept of Kamma and M&#257;la. Kommula is
further a professional title for horn-blowers, mainly M&#257;la,
M&#257;diga, and Panisavan, who perform at festivals and funerals.
Kommi.&mdash;A g&#333;tra of Gollas, the members of which may
not use kommi fuel.
Kompala (houses).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga.
K&#333;n&#257;n.&mdash;K&#333;n&#257;n or K&#333;n&#257;r is
a title of Idaiyans. Some Gollas call themselves
K&#333;n&#257;nulu.
K&#333;nangi (buffoon).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga.
Konda (mountain).&mdash;An exogamous sept of
D&#275;v&#257;nga and M&#275;dara, and a synonym for Konda Dora.
Konda Dora.&mdash;The Konda Doras are a caste of hill
cultivators, found chiefly in Vizagapatam. Concerning them
Surgeon-Major W. R. Cornish writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5289src" href="#xd21e5289" name="xd21e5289src">152
&ldquo;Contrasting strangely with the energetic, patriarchal, and
land-reverencing Parja (Poroja), are the neighbouring indigenous tribes
found along the slopes of the eastern ghauts. They are known as Konda
Doras, Konda K&#257;pus, and Ojas. From what has been ascertained of
their languages, it seems certain that, divested of the differences
which have been engrafted upon them by the fact of the one being
influenced by Uriya and the other by Telugu, they are substantially of
the same origin as the Parja language and the Khond language. But the
people themselves seem to have entirely lost all those rights to the
soil, which are now characteristic of the more northern tribes. They
are completely at the [<a id="pb350" href=
"#pb350" name="pb350">350]mercy of late immigrants, so much
so that, though they call themselves Konda Doras, they are called by
the Bhaktas, their immediate superiors, Konda K&#257;pus. If they are
found living in a village with no Telugu superior, they are known as
Doras. If, on the other hand, such a man is at the head of the village
affairs, they are to him as adscripti gleb&aelig;, and
are denominated K&#257;pus or ryots (cultivators). It is apparent that
the comparatively degraded position that this particular soil-folk
holds is due to the influence of the Telugu colonists; and the reason
why they have been subjected to a greater extent than the cognate
tribes further inland is possibly that the Telugu colonization is of
more ancient date than the Uriya colonization. It may further be
surmised that, from the comparative proximity of the Telugu districts,
the occupation of the crests of these gh&#257;ts partook rather of the
character of a conquest than that of mere settlings in the land. But,
however it came about, the result is most disastrous. Some parts of
P&#257;chipenta, Hill M&#257;dugulu, and Kondakamb&#275;ru, which have
been occupied by Telugu-speaking folk, are far inferior in agricultural
prosperity to the inland parts, where the Uriyas have assumed the lead
in the direction of affairs.&rdquo;
In the Census Report, 1891, Mr. H. A. Stuart writes that
&ldquo;these people all speak Telugu, and the majority of them have
returned that as their parent-tongue. But a large number returned their
caste name in the parent-tongue column. I have since received a
vocabulary, which is said to be taken from the dialect of the Konda
Doras; and, if this is correct, then the real speech of these people is
a dialect of Khond.&rdquo; One Durgi P&#257;tro, the head of a mutta
(division of a Zemindari) informed Mr. G. F. Paddison that Konda Doras
and Khonds are [<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351]identical. In the Census Report, 1901, Mr. W.
Francis states that the Konda Doras &ldquo;seem to be a section of the
Khonds, which has largely taken to speaking Telugu, has adopted some of
the Telugu customs, and is in the transitional stage between Animism
and Hinduism. They call themselves Hindus, and worship the
P&#257;ndavas and a goddess called Talupulamma. They drink alcohol, and
eat pork, mutton, etc., and will dine with K&#257;pus.&rdquo; At times
of census, P&#257;ndavakulam (or P&#257;ndava caste) has been returned
as a title of the Konda Doras.
For the following note I am indebted to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao. There
are, among the Konda Doras, two well-defined divisions, called Pedda
(big) and Chinna (little) Kondalu. Of these, the former have remained
in their old semi-independent position, while the latter have come
under Telugu domination. The Chinna Kondalu, who have been living in
contact with the Bhaktha caste, have adopted the Telugu system of
intip&#275;rulu, as exogamous septs, whereas the Pedda Kondalu have
retained the totem divisions, which occur among other hill castes,
e.g., N&#257;ga (cobra), Bh&#257;g (tiger), and Kochchimo
(tortoise). Among the Chinna Kondalu, the custom of m&#275;narikam,
according to which a man marries his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter,
is observed, and may further marry his own sister&rsquo;s daughter. The
Chinna Kondalu women wear glass bangles and beads, like women of the
plains. Men of the Chinna Kondalu section serve as bearers and
Government employees, whereas those of the Pedda Kondalu section are
engaged in cultivation. The former have personal names corresponding to
those of the inhabitants of the plains, e.g., Linganna,
Gangamma, while the names of the latter are taken from the day of the
week on which [<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352]they were born, e.g., Bhudra (Wednesday),
Sukra (Friday).
Among the Chinna Kondalu, a girl is married before or after puberty.
When a marriage is decided on, the girl&rsquo;s parents receive a
present (v&#333;li) of four rupees and a female cloth. On an auspicious
day fixed by the Chukkamusti (star-gazer), the bride is conducted to
the home of the bridegroom. The contracting couple are bathed in
turmeric-water, put on new cloths presented by their fathers-in-law,
and wrist-threads are tied on their wrists. On the same day, or the
following morning, at a time settled by the Chukkamusti, the
bridegroom, under the direction of a caste elder, ties the
satham&#257;nam (marriage badge) on the bride&rsquo;s neck. On the
following day, the wrist-threads are removed, and the newly married
couple bathe.
Among the Pedda, as among the Chinna Kondalu, a girl is married
before or after puberty. When a man contemplates taking a wife, his
parents carry three pots of liquor to the home of the girl whose hand
he seeks. The acceptance of these by her father is a sign that the
match is agreeable to him, and a jholla tonka (bride-price) of five
rupees is paid to him. The future bridegroom&rsquo;s party has to give
three feasts to that of the bride-elect, for each of which a pig is
killed. The girl is conducted to the house of the bridegroom, and, if
she has reached puberty, remains there. Otherwise she returns home, and
joins her husband later on, the occasion being celebrated by a further
feast of pork.
Both sections allow the remarriage of widows. Among the Pedda
Kondalu, a younger brother may marry the widow of his elder brother. By
both sections divorce is permitted. Among the Chinna Kondalus, a man
who marries a divorc&eacute;e has to pay her first husband twenty-four
[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353]rupees, of which half is divided among the
neighbouring caste villages in certain recognised proportions.
The dead are usually burnt by both sections. The Pedda Kondalu kill
a pig on the third day, and hold a feast, at which much liquor is
disposed of. By the Chinna Kondalu the chinna r&#333;zu (little day)
ceremony is observed, as it is by other castes dwelling in the
plains.
The Chinna Kondalu bear the titles Anna or Ayya when they are merely
cultivators under Bhaktha landlords, and Dora under other
circumstances. The Pedda Kondalu usually have no title.
A riot took place, in 1900, at the village of Korravanivalasa in the
Vizagapatam district, under the following strange circumstances.
&ldquo;A Konda Dora of this place, named Korra Mallayya, pretended that
he was inspired, and gradually gathered round him a camp of four or
five thousand people from various parts of the agency. At first his
proceedings were harmless enough, but in April he gave out that he was
a re-incarnation of one of the five P&#257;ndava brothers; that his
infant son was the god Krishna; that he would drive out the English and
rule the country himself; and that, to effect this, he would arm his
followers with bamboos, which should be turned by magic into guns, and
would change the weapons of the authorities into water. Bamboos were
cut, and rudely fashioned to resemble guns, and armed with these, the
camp was drilled by the Sw&#257;mi (god), as Mallayya had come to be
called. The assembly next sent word that they were going to loot
P&#257;chipenta, and when, on the 1st May, two constables came to see
how matters stood, the fanatics fell upon them, and beat them to death.
The local police endeavoured to recover the bodies, but, owing to the
threatening [<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354]attitude of the Sw&#257;mi&rsquo;s followers,
had to abandon the attempt. The District Magistrate then went to the
place in person, collected reserve police from Vizagapatam,
P&#257;rvatipur, and Jeypore, and at dawn on the 7th May rushed the
camp to arrest the Sw&#257;mi and the other leaders of the movement.
The police were resisted by the mob, and obliged to fire. Eleven of the
rioters were killed, others wounded or arrested, and the rest
dispersed. Sixty of them were tried for rioting, and three, including
the Sw&#257;mi, for murdering the constables. Of the latter, the
Sw&#257;mi died in jail, and the other two were hanged. The
Sw&#257;mi&rsquo;s infant son, the god Krishna, also died, and all
trouble ended at once and completely.&rdquo;
Concerning the Konda K&#257;pus or Konda Reddis of the God&#257;vari
district, Mr. F. R. Hemingway writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5333src" href="#xd21e5333" name="xd21e5333src">153 &ldquo;The
hill Reddis, or Konda Reddis, are a caste of jungle men, having some
characteristics in common with the K&#333;yas. They usually talk a
rough Telugu, clipping their words so that it is often difficult to
understand them; but it is said that some of them speak K&#333;ya. They
are of slighter build than the K&#333;yas, and their villages are even
smaller. They will not eat in the house of a K&#333;ya. They call
themselves by various high-sounding titles, such as P&#257;ndava
Reddis, R&#257;ja Reddis, and Reddis of the solar race
(S&#363;ryavamsa), and do not like the plain name of Konda Reddi. They
recognize no endogamous sub-divisions, but have exogamous septs. In
character they resemble the K&#333;yas, but are less simple and stupid,
and in former years were much given to crime. They live by shifting
cultivation. They do not touch beef, but will eat pork. They profess to
be both Saivites and Vaishnavites, and occasionally employ <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355]Br&#257;hman priests at their funerals; and yet
they worship the P&#257;ndavas, the spirits of the hills (or, as they
call them, the sons of R&#257;cha), their ancestors including women who
have died before their husbands, and the deity Muthy&#257;lamma and her
brother P&#333;tur&#257;zu, S&#257;ralamma, and Unamalamma. The last
three are found in nearly every village. Other deities are Doddiganga,
who is the protector of cattle, and is worshipped when the herds are
driven into the forests to graze, and D&#275;saganga (or Paraganga),
who takes the place of the Maridamma of the plains, and the
Muthy&#257;lamma of the K&#333;yas as goddess of cholera and small-pox.
The shrine of S&#257;ralamma of Pedakonda, eight miles east of
R&#275;kapalle, is a place of pilgrimage, and so is Bison Hill
(P&#257;pikonda), where an important Reddi festival is held every seven
or eight years in honour of the P&#257;ndava brothers, and a huge fat
pig, fattened for the occasion, is killed and eaten. The Reddis, like
the K&#333;yas, also observe the harvest festivals. They are very
superstitious, believing firmly in sorcery, and calling in wizards in
time of illness. Their villages are formed into groups like those of
the K&#333;yas, and the hereditary headmen over these are called by
different names, such as Dora, M&#363;ttadar, Varnapedda, and
Kulapatradu. Headmen of villages are known as Pettadars. They
recognise, though they do not frequently practice, marriage by capture.
If a parent wishes to show his dislike for a match, he absents himself
when the suitor&rsquo;s party calls, and sends a bundle of cold rice
after them when they have departed. Children are buried. Vaishnavite
Reddis burn their adult dead, while the Saivites bury them.
S&#257;t&#257;nis officiate as priests to the former, and Jangams to
the latter. The pyre is kindled by the eldest male of the family, and a
feast is held on the fifth day after the [<a id=
"pb356" href="#pb356" name="pb356">356]funeral. The dead are
believed to be born again into their former families.&rdquo;
Kondaikatti.&mdash;The name of a sub-division of
Vell&#257;las, meaning those who tie the whole mass of hair of the head
(kondai) in a knot on the top of the head, as opposed to the kudumi or
knot at the back of the partially shaved head.
Kondaita.&mdash;A sub-division of Doluva.
Kondaiyamkottai.&mdash;A sub-division of Maravan.
Kondalar.&mdash;Recorded, in the Madras Census Report, 1901,
as a sub-caste of Vell&#257;la. Kondalam means women&rsquo;s hair or a
kind of dance, and it is possible that the name was returned by people
of the D&#275;va-d&#257;si caste, who are rising in the social scale,
and becoming absorbed in the Vell&#257;la caste. Kondali, of doubtful
meaning, has been returned by cultivators and agricultural labourers in
North Arcot.
Kondh.&mdash;In the Administration Report of the Ganjam
Agency, 1902&ndash;3, Mr. C. B. Cotterell writes that Kondh is an exact
transliteration from the vernacular, and he knows of no reason, either
sentimental or etymological, for keeping such spelling as Khond.
It is noted, in the Madras Census Report, 1891, that &ldquo;the
Khonds inhabit the hill tracts of Ganjam and parts of Vizagapatam, and
are found also in Bengal and the Central Provinces. They call
themselves Kui, a name identical with the Koi or Koya of the
God&#257;vari agency and the south of the Jeypore Zemind&#257;ri. The
Telugu people call them K&#333;tuv&#257;ndlu. The origin of the name
Khond is doubtful, but Macpherson is, I think, right in deriving it
from Telugu Konda, a hill. There is a tribe in Vizagapatam called Konda
Dora or Konda K&#257;pu, and these people are also frequently called
K&#333;tuv&#257;ndlu. All these names are derivatives of the root
k&ocirc; or k&ucirc;, a [<a id="pb357" href=
"#pb357" name="pb357">357]mountain. The number of
sub-divisions returned is 58. The list includes many names of other
castes, a fact which must be in part ascribed to the impossibility of
distinguishing the true Khonds from persons returned as
Kondav&#257;ndlu, Kondalu, K&#333;tuv&#257;ndlu, etc., terms which mean
simply highlanders, and are applicable to all the hill tribes. For
example, 12,164 P&#257;nos have returned their main caste as
Khond.&rdquo;
In a note on the Kui, Kandh&#299;, or Khond language, Mr. G. A.
Grierson writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5367src" href=
"#xd21e5367" name="xd21e5367src">154 &ldquo;The Kandhs or Khonds
are a Dravidian tribe in the hills of Orissa and neighbouring
districts. The tribe is commonly known under the name of Khond. The
Oriy&#257;s call them Kandhs, and the Telugu people G&#333;nds or
K&#333;ds. The name which they use themselves is Ku, and their language
should accordingly be denominated Kui. The word Ku is probably related
to K&#333;&#299;, one of the names by which the G&#333;nds used to
denote themselves. The K&#333;&#299; dialect of G&#333;ndi is, however,
quite different from Kui. The Khonds live in the midst of the
Oriy&#257; territory. Their habitat is the hills separating the
districts of Ganjam and Vizagapatam in the Madras Presidency, and
continuing northwards into the Orissa Tributary States, B&#333;d,
Daspalla, and Nayagarh, and, crossing the Mah&#257;nadi, into Angul and
the Khondmals. The Khond area further extends into the Central
Provinces, covering the northern part Kalahandi, and the south of
Patna. Kui is surrounded on all sides by Oriy&#257;. Towards the south
it extends towards the confines of the Telugu territory. The language
varies locally, all over this area. The differences are not, however,
great, though a man from one part of the country often experiences
difficulty [<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358]in understanding the Kui spoken in other parts.
There are two principal dialects, one eastern, spoken in Gumsur and the
adjoining parts of Bengal, and one western, spoken in Chinna Kimedi. In
the north, Kui has come under the influence of the neighbouring Aryan
forms of speech, and a specimen forwarded from the Patna State was
written in Oriy&#257; with a slight admixture of Chattisgarh&#299;. The
number of Kandhs returned at the census of 1891 was 627,388. The
language returns, however, give a much smaller figure. The reason is
that many Kandhs have abandoned their native speech.&rdquo;
It has been noted that &ldquo;the character of the Khonds varies as
much as their language. Where there has been much contact with the
plains, it is not as favourable as elsewhere. As a rule, they may be
taken to be a bold, and fitfully laborious mountain peasantry of
simple, but not undignified manners; upright in their conduct; sincere
in their superstitions; proud of their position as landholders; and
tenacious of their rights. The Linepada Khonds affect manners like
Uriyas, and, among other things, will not eat pork (the flesh of wild
pigs excepted). The Khond villages have quite the appearance of Uriya
villages, the houses are built with mud walls, a thing unknown with
Khonds in other parts of the M&#257;liahs; and there is also much neat
garden cultivation, which is rare elsewhere, probably because the
produce thereof would be appropriated by the Uriyas. In 1902, the
Linepada Muttah (settlement) presented the unusual spectacle of a Khond
ruler as Dolab&#275;hara, as well as Moliko, with the Uriya Paiks
really at his beck and call. In some places, the most valuable portions
of the land have passed into the possession of Sondis and low-country
sowcars (money-lenders), who have pandered to the Khonds by advancing
them money, the greater [<a id="pb359" href=
"#pb359" name="pb359">359]portion of which has been expended
in drink, the repayment being exacted in land. Except in the Goomsur
M&#257;liahs, paddy (rice) cultivation is not extensively carried on by
the Khonds; elsewhere it is chiefly in the hands of the Uriyas. The
Khonds take little trouble in raising their crops. The result is that,
except in the Goomsur M&#257;liahs, where they grow crops to sell in
the market for profit, we find a poverty-stricken race, possessing
hardly any agricultural stock, and no signs of affluence. In Kimedi,
however, they are beginning to follow the example of Goomsur, and
doubtless their material prosperity would much increase if some check
could be devised to save them from the Uriyas and Sondis, who are
steadily acquiring all the wet land, and utilising the Khonds merely as
cultivators.&rdquo;
It is noted by Mr. F. Fawcett (1902)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5378src" href="#xd21e5378" name="xd21e5378src">155 that
&ldquo;up to within fifteen years ago, the Kh&ocirc;nds of the Ganjam
hills would not engage in any ordinary labour. They would not, for
example, carry even the smallest article of the district
officer&rsquo;s luggage. Elephants were accordingly provided by
Government for carriage of tents and all camp luggage. But there has
come a change, and, within the last ten years or so, the Kh&ocirc;nds
have taken to work in the ordinary way. Within the last few years, for
the first time, the Kh&ocirc;nds have been emigrating to Assam, to work
in the tea-gardens. Accurate figures are not available, but the
estimate of the best authority gives the number as about 3,000. This
emigration is now stopped by edict. Of course, they do not set out, and
go of their own accord. They are taken. The strange thing is that they
go willingly.&rdquo; It was enacted, in an order of Government, in
1901,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5381src" href="#xd21e5381" name=
"xd21e5381src">156 that &ldquo;in [<a id=
"pb360" href="#pb360" name="pb360">360]exercise of the power
conferred by section 3 of the Assam Labour and Emigration Act, 1901,
and with the previous sanction of the Governor-General in Council, the
Governor in Council is pleased to prohibit absolutely all persons from
recruiting, engaging, inducing, or assisting any Native of India to
emigrate from the tracts known as the scheduled districts in the
district of Ganjam to any labour district of Assam.&rdquo;
In 1908, the Madras Government approved of certain proposals made by
the Collector of Ganjam for utilising the services of the Kondhs in the
conservancy of the forests in the Pondakhol Agency. The following is a
summary of these proposals.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5388src" href=
"#xd21e5388" name="xd21e5388src">157 The chief difficulty to be
contended against in Pondakhol is podu cultivation. This cultivation is
not only devastating the hill tops and upper slopes, which should be
kept well covered to preserve water for the upper reaches of the
Rushikulya river, the chief source of irrigation in Ganjam, but is also
the origin of most of the forest fires that rage throughout Pondakhol
in the hot weather. The District Forest Officer, in discussing matters
with the Kondhs, was told by some of the villagers that they would
forego poduing if they had cattle to plough the lands in the plains and
valleys. The supply of buffaloes would form the compensation for a
right relinquished. The next aim should be to give the people work in
the non-cultivation season, which is from the middle of January to the
middle of July. This luckily coincides with the fire season. There is
an abundance of useful work that the Kondhs can be engaged in,
e.g., rendering the demarcation lines permanent, making fire
lines, constructing roads, and building inspection sheds. The
[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361]question arises as to how the Khonds should be
repaid for their labour. Money is of little use to them in this
out-of-the-way part of the country, and, if they got it, they would
probably go to Surada to get drunk on it. It would be better to pay
them in food-grain and cloths, and for this purpose departmental shops,
and a regular system of accounts, such as are in force among the
Chenchus in Kurnool, would be necessary.
In the course of a lament over the change which has come over the
Kondhs who live in the range of hills near Berhampore, Mr. S. P. Rice
writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5398src" href=
"#xd21e5398" name="xd21e5398src">158 &ldquo;Here they live in
seclusion and in freedom, but also in the lowest depths of squalor and
poverty. Once they loved gay colours. True Khond dresses, both male and
female, are full of stripes and patterns, in blue, yellow, and red.
Where has gone the love of colour? Instead of the long waistcloth
ending in tails of blue and red, the man binds about him a wretched rag
that can hardly be called a garment. Once the women took a delight in
decking themselves with flowers, and a pride in the silver ornaments
that jangled on their naked breasts. Where are now the grasses that
adorned them, and the innocence that allowed them to go clothed only to
the waist? Gone! withered by the blast of the breath of a
&lsquo;superior civilization.&rsquo; Gone are the hairpins of
s&#257;mbur bone&mdash;an inestimable treasure in the eyes of the true
hill Khond. Gone are the floral decorations, and the fantastic
head-dresses, which are the pride of the mountain tribes. In dull,
unromantic squalor our Khond lives, moves, and has his being; arid,
ever as he moves, is heard the clanking upon his wrists of the fetters
of his debt. Yet for all that he is happy.&rdquo; The hairpins
[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362]referred to above are made from s&#257;mbur
(deer: Cervus unicolor) bones, and stuck in the hair of male
Kondhs. Porcupine quills are sometimes used by them as hairpins.
The following brief, but interesting summary of the Kondhs of Ganjam
is given by Mr. C. F. MacCartie.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5408src"
href="#xd21e5408" name="xd21e5408src">159 &ldquo;The staple food of
the Oriyas is rice, and of the Khond also during the two or three
months that succeed the harvest. In February, they gather the crop of
hill dholl, which, eked out with dry mohwa (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Bassia) fruit, fresh mangoes, and mango stones ground to
a sort of flour, pull them through the hot weather, with the help of
various yams and edible roots that are plentiful in the jungles. When
the south-west monsoon sets in, dry crops, consisting of millets, hill
paddy, and Indian corn, are sown, which ripen from August on, and thus
afford plentiful means of subsistence. The hot weather is generally
called the sukki kalo, or hungry season, as the people are rather
pinched just then. Turmeric is perhaps the most valuable crop which the
Khonds raise, as it is the most laborious, in consequence of the time
it takes to mature&mdash;two full years, and the constant field-work
thus entailed, first in sheltering the young plants from the sun by
artificial shade, and afterwards in digging, boiling, and burnishing
the root for market. Tobacco is raised much as in the low country. It
is generally grown in back-yards, as elsewhere, and a good deal of care
is devoted to its cultivation, as the Khonds are inveterate smokers.
Among the products of the jungles may be included myrabolams (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Terminalia fruits), tassar silk, cocoons, and dammar,
all of which are bartered by the finders to trading P&#257;nos in small
quantities, generally [<a id="pb363" href=
"#pb363" name="pb363">363]for salt. [Honey and wax are said
to be collected by the Kondhs and Benias, who are expert climbers of
precipitous rocks and lofty trees. The Kondhs recognise four different
kinds of bees, known by the following Oriya names:&mdash;(a)
bhaga mohu, a large-sized bee (Apis dorsata);
(b) sattapuri mohu, building its comb in seven layers (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Apis indica); (c) binchina mohu, with a comb like
a fan; (d) nikiti mohu, a very small bee.]<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5438src" href="#xd21e5438" name="xd21e5438src">160 Wet paddy
is, of course, grown in the valleys and low-lying bottoms, where water
is available, and much ingenuity is exercised in the formation of bunds
(embankments) to retain the natural supply of moisture. The Khond has a
dead eye for a natural level; it is surprising how speedily a seemingly
impracticable tract of jungle will be converted into paddy fields by a
laborious process of levelling by means of a flat board attached to a
pair of buffaloes. The chief feature of the dry cultivation is the
destructive practice of kumeri. A strip of forest, primeval, if
possible, as being more fertile, is burnt, cultivated, and then
deserted for a term of years, which may vary from three to thirty,
according to the density or otherwise of the population. The Kutiah
Khonds are the chief offenders in respect of kumeri, to which they
confine themselves, as they have no ploughs or agricultural cattle. In
the rare instances when they grow a little rice, the fields are
prepared by manual and pedal labour, as men, women, and children,
assemble in the field, and puddle the mud and water until it assumes
the desired consistency for the reception of the seed.
&ldquo;The hair is worn long during childhood, but tied into a club
when maturity is reached, and turbans are seldom worn. A narrow cloth
is bound round the loins, [<a id="pb364" href=
"#pb364" name="pb364">364]with Tartan ends which hang down
in front and behind, and a coarse long-cloth is wrapped round the
figure when the weather is cold. The war dress of the Khonds is
elaborate, and consists of a leather cuirass in front, and a flowing
red cloak, which, with an arrangement of &lsquo;bison&rsquo; horns and
peacock&rsquo;s feathers, is supposed to strike awe into the
beholder&rsquo;s mind. Khond women wear a red or parti-coloured skirt
reaching the knee, the neck and bosom being left bare. P&#257;no
females generally wear an upper cloth. All tattoo their faces.
[Tattooing is said to be performed, concurrently with ear-boring, when
girls are about ten years old. The tattoo marks are said to represent
the implement used in tilling the soil for cultivation, moustache,
beard, etc.] Ornaments of beads and brass bangles are worn, but the
usage of diverse muttas (settlements) varies very much. In some parts
of the Goomsur M&#257;liahs, the use of glass and brass beads is
confined to married women, virgins being restricted to decorations
composed of plaited grass. Matrons wear ten or twelve ear-rings of
different patterns, but, in many parts, young girls substitute pieces
of broom, which are worn till the wedding day, and then discarded for
brazen rings. Anklets are indispensable in the dance on account of the
jingling noise they make, and gold or silver noserings are very
commonly worn. [The Kondh of the Ganjam M&#257;liahs has been described
as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5445src" href="#xd21e5445" name=
"xd21e5445src">161 &ldquo;He centres his great love of decoration
in his hair. This he tends, combs and oils, with infinite care, and
twists into a large loose knot, which is caught with curiously shaped
pins of sambur bone, gaily coloured combs and bronze hairpins with
curiously ornamented designs, and it is then gracefully pinned over the
left eyebrow. This [<a id="pb365" href="#pb365"
name="pb365">365]knot he decorates according to his fancy
with the blue feathers of the jay (Indian roller, <i lang=
"la-x-bio">Coracias indica), or the white feathers of the crane and
stork, or the feathers of the more gorgeous peacock. Two feathers
generally wave in front, while many more float behind. This knot, in
the simple economy of his life, also does duty as a pocket or
pincushion, for into it he stuffs his knife, his half-smoked cigarette
of home-grown tobacco rolled in a s&#257;l (Shorea
robusta) leaf, or even his snuff wrapped in another leaf pinned
together with a thorn. Round his waist he wraps a white cloth, bordered
with a curious design in blue and red, of excellent home manufacture,
and over his shoulder is borne his almost inseparable companion, the
tanghi, of many curious shapes, consisting of an iron blade with a long
wooden handle ornamented with brass wire. In certain places, he very
frequently carries a bow and arrows, the former made of bent bamboo,
the string of a long strip of bark, and the handle ornamented with
stripes of the white quills of the peacock.]
&ldquo;The Khonds are very keen in the pursuit of game, for which
the hot weather is the appointed time, and, during this period, a
sambar or &lsquo;bison&rsquo; has but little chance of escape if once
wounded by an arrow, as they stick to the trail like sleuth hounds, and
appear insensible to distance or fatigue. The arms they carry are the
bow, arrows, and tangi, a species of light battle-axe that inflicts a
serious wound. The women are not addicted to drink, but the males are
universally attached to liquor, especially during the hot weather, when
the sago palm (solopo: Caryota urens) is in full
flow. They often run up sheds in the jungle, near especially good
trees, and drink for days together. A great many deaths occur at this
season by falls from trees when tapping the liquor. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name=
"pb366">366]Feasts and sacrifices are occasions for drinking
to excess, and the latter especially are often scenes of wild
intoxication, the liquor used being either mohwa, or a species of
strong beer brewed from rice or koeri. Khond women, when once married,
appear to keep pretty straight, but there is a good deal of quiet
immorality among the young men and girls, especially during the
commencement of the hot weather, when parties are made up for fishing
or the collection of mohwa fruit and other jungle berries. At the same
time, a certain sense of shame exists, as instances are not at all
uncommon of double suicide, when a pair of too ardent lovers are blown
upon, and their liaison is discovered.
&ldquo;The generality of Khond and P&acirc;no houses are constructed
of broad s&acirc;l logs hewn out with the axe, and thatched with jungle
grass, which is impervious to white-ants. In bamboo jungles, bamboo is
substituted for s&acirc;l. The Khond houses are substantially built but
very low, the pitch of the roof never exceeding 8 feet, and the eaves
being only about 4 feet from the ground, the object being to ensure
resistance to the violent storms that prevail during the monsoons.
&ldquo;Intermarriage between Khonds, P&acirc;nos, and Uriyas is not
recognised, but cases do occur when a P&acirc;no induces a Khond woman
to go off with him. She may live with him as his wife, but no ceremony
takes place. If a P&acirc;no commits adultery with a Khond married
woman, he has to pay a paronjo, or a fine of a buffalo, to the husband
who retains his wife, and in addition a goat, a pig, a basket of paddy,
a rupee, and a cavady (shoulder-pole) load of pots. If the adulterer is
a Khond, he gets off with payment of the buffalo, which is slaughtered
for the entertainment of the village. The husband retains his wife in
this case, as also if he finds [<a id="pb367"
href="#pb367" name="pb367">367]her pregnant when first she
comes to him; this is not an uncommon incident. Divorce of the wife on
the husband&rsquo;s part is thus very rare, if it occurs at all, but
cases are not unknown where the wife divorces her husband, and adopts a
fresh alliance. When this takes place, her father has to return the
whole of the gifts known as gontis, which the bridegroom paid for his
wife when the marriage was originally arranged.&rdquo;
In a note on the tribes of the Agency tracts of the Vizagapatam
district, Mr. W. Francis writes as follows.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5475src" href="#xd21e5475" name="xd21e5475src">162 &ldquo;Of
these, by far the most numerous are the Khonds, who are about 150,000
strong. An overwhelming majority of this number, however, are not the
wild barbarous Khonds regarding whom there is such a considerable
literature, and who are so prominent in Ganjam, but a series of
communities descended from them, which exhibit infinite degrees of
difference from their more interesting progenitors, according to the
grade of civilisation to which they have attained. The only really
primitive Khonds in Vizagapatam are the Dongria (jungle) Khonds of the
north of Bissamkatak t&#257;luk, the D&#275;sya Khonds who live just
south-west of them in and around the Nimgiris, and the Kuttiya (hill)
Khonds of the hills in the north-east of the Gunupur t&#257;luk. The
Kuttiya Khond men wear ample necklets of white beads and prominent
brass earrings, but otherwise they dress like any other hill people.
Their women, however, have a distinctive garb, putting on a kind of
turban on state occasions, wearing nothing above the waist except
masses of white bead necklaces which almost cover their breasts, and
carrying a series of heavy brass bracelets half way up their forearms.
The dhangadi basa system (separate [<a id="pb368"
href="#pb368" name="pb368">368]hut for unmarried girls to
sleep in) prevails among them in its simplest form, and girls have
opportunities for the most intimate acquaintance before they need
inform their parents they wish to marry. Special ceremonies are
practiced to prevent the spirits of the dead (especially of those
killed by tigers) from returning to molest the living. Except
totemistic septs, they have apparently no sub-divisions.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5480src" href="#xd21e5480" name=
"xd21e5480src">163 The dress of the civilised Khonds of both sexes
is ordinary and uninteresting. These civilised Khonds worship all
degrees of deities, from their own tribal J&#257;kara down to the
orthodox Hindu gods; follow every gradation of marriage and funeral
customs from those of their primitive forefathers to those of the
low-country Telugu; speak dialects which range from good Khond through
bastard patois down to corrupt Telugu; and allow their totemistic septs
to be degraded down to, or divided into, the intip&#275;rulu of the
plains.&rdquo;
There is a tradition that, in olden days, four Kondhs, named Kasi,
Mendora, Bolti, and Bolo, with eyes the size of brass pots, teeth like
axe-heads, and ears like elephant&rsquo;s ears, brought their ancestor
Mandia P&#257;tro from Jorasingi in Boad, and gave him and his children
authority all over the country now comprised in Mahasingi, and in
Kurtilli Barakhumma, Bodogodo, Balliguda, and Pussangia, on condition
of settling their disputes, and aiding them in their rights. The
following legendary account of the origin of the Kondhs is given by Mr.
A. B. Jayaram Moodaliar. Once upon a time, the ground was all wet, and
there were only two females on the earth, named Karaboodi and
Tharthaboodi, each of whom was blessed with a single male child. The
names [<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369]of the children were Kasarodi and Singarodi. All
these individuals sprang from the interior of the earth, together with
two small plants called nangakoocha and badokoocha, on which they
depended for subsistence. One day, when Karaboodi was cutting these
plants for cooking, she accidentally cut the little finger of her left
hand, and the blood dropped on the ground. Instantly, the wet soft
earth on which it fell became dry and hard. The woman then cooked the
food, and gave some of it to her son, who asked her why it tasted so
much sweeter than usual. She replied that she might have a dream that
night, and, if so, would let him know. Next morning, the woman told him
that, if he would act on her advice, he would prosper in this world,
that he was not to think of her as his mother, and was to cut away the
flesh of her back, dig several holes in the ground, bury the flesh, and
cover the holes with stones. This her son did, and the rest of the body
was cremated. The wet soil dried up and became hard, and all kinds of
animals and trees came into existence. A partridge scratched the ground
with its feet, and r&#257;gi (millet), maize, dh&#257;l (pea), and rice
sprung forth from it. The two brothers argued that, as the sacrifice of
their mother brought forth such abundance, they must sacrifice their
brothers, sisters, and others, once a year in future.A god, by name
Boora Panoo, came, with his wife and children, to Tharthaboodi and the
two young men, to whom Boora Panoo&rsquo;s daughters were married. They
begat children, who were divided equally between Boora Panoo the
grandfather and their fathers. Tharthaboodi objected to this division
on the grounds that Boora Panoo&rsquo;s son would stand in the relation
of Mamoo to the children of Kasarodi and Singarodi; that, if the child
was a female, when she got married, she would have to give a rupee to
her Mamoo; [<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370]and that, if it was a male that Boora
Panoo&rsquo;s daughter brought forth, the boy when he grew up would
have to give the head of any animal he shot to Mamoo (Boora
Panoo&rsquo;s son). Then Boora Panoo built a house, and Kasarodi and
Singarodi built two houses. All lived happily for two years. Then
Karaboodi appeared in a dream, and told Kasarodi and Singarodi that, if
they offered another human victim, their lands would be very fertile,
and their cattle could flourish. In the absence of a suitable being,
they sacrificed a monkey. Then Karaboodi appeared once more, and said
that she was not pleased with the substitution of the monkey, and that
a human being must be sacrificed. The two men, with their eight
children, sought for a victim for twelve years. At the end of that
time, they found a poor man, who had a son four years old, and found
him, his wife and child good food, clothing, and shelter for a year.
They then asked permission to sacrifice the son in return for their
kindness, and the father gave his assent. The boy was fettered and
handcuffed to prevent his running away, and taken good care of. Liquor
was prepared from grains, and a bamboo, with a flag hoisted on it,
planted in the ground. Next day, a pig was sacrificed near this post,
and a feast was held. It was proclaimed that the boy would be tied to a
post on the following day, and sacrificed on the third day. On the
night previous to the sacrifice, the Janni (priest) took a reed, and
poked it into the ground in several places. When it entered to a depth
of about eight inches, it was believed that the god and goddess
Tadapanoo and Dasapanoo were there. Round this spot, seven pieces of
wood were arranged lengthways and crossways, and an egg was placed in
the centre of the structure. The Khonds arrived from the various
villages, and indulged in drink. The boy was teased, <span class=
"pagenum">[371]and
told that he had been sold to them, that his sorrow would affect his
parents only, and that he was to be sacrificed for the prosperity of
the people. He was conducted to the spot where the god and goddess had
been found, tied with ropes, and held fast by the Khonds. He was made
to lie on his stomach on the wooden structure, and held there. Pieces
of flesh were removed from his back, arms and legs, and portions
thereof buried at the Khond&rsquo;s place of worship. Portions were
also set up near a well of drinking water, and placed around the
villages. The remainder of the sacrificed corpse was cremated on a pyre
set alight with fire produced by the friction of two pieces of wood. On
the following day, a buffalo was sacrificed, and a feast partaken of.
Next day, the bamboo post was removed outside the village, and a fowl
and eggs were offered to the deity. The following stanza is still
recited by the Janni at the buffalo sacrifice, which has been
substituted for that of a human victim:&mdash;Oh! come, male slave;
come, female slave. What do you say? What do you call out for? You have
been brought, ensnared by the Haddi. You have been called, ensnared by
the Domba. What can I do, even if you are my child? You are sold for a
pot of food.
The ethnological section of the Madras Museum received a few years
ago a very interesting relic in the shape of a human (Meriah) sacrifice
post from Baligudu in Ganjam. This post, which was fast being reduced
to a mere shell by white-ants, is, I believe, the only one now in
existence. It was brought by Colonel Pickance, who was Assistant
Superintendent of Police, and set up in the ground near the gate of the
reserve Police barracks. The veteran members of a party of Kondhs, who
were brought to Madras for the purpose of performing before
[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372]the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1906, became
wildly excited when they came across this relic of their former
barbarous custom.
&ldquo;The best known case,&rdquo; Mr. Frazer writes,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5497src" href="#xd21e5497" name=
"xd21e5497src">164 &ldquo;of human sacrifices systematically
offered to ensure good crops is supplied by the Khonds or Kandhs. Our
knowledge of them is derived from the accounts written by British
officers, who, forty or fifty years ago, were engaged in putting them
down. The sacrifices were offered to the earth goddess, Tari Pennu or
Bera Pennu, and were believed to ensure good crops, and immunity from
all diseases and accidents. In particular, they were considered
necessary in the cultivation of turmeric, the Khonds arguing that the
turmeric could not have a deep red colour without the shedding of
blood. The victim, a Meriah, was acceptable to the goddess only if he
had been purchased, or had been born a victim, that is the son of a
victim father, or had been devoted as a child by his father or
guardian.&rdquo;
In 1837, Mr. Russell, in a report on the districts entrusted to his
control, wrote as follows.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5502src" href=
"#xd21e5502" name="xd21e5502src">165 &ldquo;The ceremonies
attending the barbarous rite, and still more the mode of destroying
life, vary in different parts of the country. In the M&#257;liahs of
Goomsur, the sacrifice is offered annually to Thadha Pennoo (the earth)
under the effigy of a bird intended to represent a peacock, with the
view of propitiating the deity to grant favourable seasons and crops.
The ceremony is performed at the expense of, and in rotation by,
certain mootahs (settlements) composing a community, and connected
together from local circumstances. Besides these periodical sacrifices,
[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373]others are made by single mootahs, and even by
individuals, to avert any threatening calamity from sickness, murrain,
or other cause. Grown men are the most esteemed (as victims), because
the most costly. Children are purchased, and reared for years with the
family of the person who ultimately devotes them to a cruel death, when
circumstances are supposed to demand a sacrifice at his hands. They
seem to be treated with kindness, and, if young, are kept under no
constraint; but, when old enough to be sensible of the fate which
awaits them, they are placed in fetters and guarded. Most of those who
were rescued had been sold by their parents or nearest relations, a
practice which, from all we could learn, is very common. Persons of
riper age are kidnapped by wretches who trade in human flesh. The
victim must always be purchased. Criminals, or prisoners captured in
war, are not considered fitting subjects. The price is paid
indifferently in brass utensils, cattle or corn. The Zanee (or priest),
who may be of any caste, officiates at the sacrifice, but he performs
the poojah (offering of flowers, incense, etc.) to the idol through the
medium of the Toomba, who must be a Khond child under seven years of
age. This child is fed and clothed at the public expense, eats with no
other person, and is subjected to no act deemed impure. For a month
prior to the sacrifice, there is much feasting and intoxication, and
dancing round the Meriah, who is adorned with garlands, etc., and, on
the day before the performance of the barbarous rite, is stupefied with
toddy, and made to sit, or, if necessary, is bound at the bottom of a
post bearing the effigy above described. The assembled multitude then
dance around to music, and addressing the earth, say: &lsquo;Oh! God,
we offer the sacrifice to you. Give us good crops, seasons, and
health.&rsquo; After which they address [<a id=
"pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374]the victim, &lsquo;We
bought you with a price, and did not seize you. Now we sacrifice you
according to custom, and no sin rests with us.&rsquo; On the following
day, the victim being again intoxicated and anointed with oil, each
individual present touches the anointed part, and wipes the oil on his
own head. All then proceed in procession around the village and its
boundaries, preceded by music, bearing the victim and a pole, to the
top of which is attached a tuft of peacock&rsquo;s feathers. On
returning to the post, which is always placed near the village deity
called Zakaree Pennoo, and represented by three stones, near which the
brass effigy in the shape of a peacock is buried, they kill a hog in
sacrifice and, having allowed the blood to flow into a pit prepared for
the purpose, the victim, who, if it has been found possible, has been
previously made senseless from intoxication, is seized and thrown in,
and his face pressed down until he is suffocated in the bloody mire
amid the noise of instruments. The Zanee then cuts a piece of flesh
from the body, and buries it with ceremony near the effigy and village
idol, as an offering to the earth. All the rest afterwards go through
the same form, and carry the bloody prize to their villages, where the
same rites are performed, part being interred near the village idol,
and little bits on the boundaries. The head and face remain untouched,
and the bones, when bare, are buried with them in the pit. After this
horrid ceremony has been completed, a buffalo calf is brought in front
of the post, and, his forefeet having been cut off, is left there till
the following day. Women, dressed in male attire and armed as men, then
drink, dance and sing round the spot, the calf is killed and eaten, and
the Zanee is dismissed with a present of rice and a hog or calf.&rdquo;
[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name=
"pb375">375]
In the same year, Mr. Arbuthnot, Collector of Vizagapatam, reported
as follows. &ldquo;Of the hill tribe Codooloo, there are said to be two
distinct classes, the Cotia Codooloo and Jathapoo Codooloo. The former
class is that which is in the habit of offering human sacrifices to the
god called Jenkery, with a view to secure good crops. This ceremony is
generally performed on the Sunday preceding or following the Pongal
feast. The victim is seldom carried by force, but procured by purchase,
and there is a fixed price for each person, which consists of forty
articles such as a bullock, a male buffalo, a cow, a goat, a piece of
cloth, a silk cloth, a brass pot, a large plate, a bunch of plantains,
etc. The man who is destined for the sacrifice is carried before the
god, and a small quantity of rice coloured with saffron (turmeric) is
put upon his head. The influence of this is said to prevent his
attempting to escape, even though set at liberty. It would appear,
however, that, from the moment of his seizure till he is sacrificed, he
is kept in a continued state of stupefaction or intoxication. He is
allowed to wander about the village, to eat and drink anything he may
take a fancy to, and even to have connection with any of the women whom
he may meet. On the morning set apart for the sacrifice, he is carried
before the idol in a state of intoxication. One of the villagers acts
as priest, who cuts a small hole in the stomach of the victim, and with
the blood that flows from the wound the idol is smeared. Then the
crowds from the neighbouring villages rush forward, and he is literally
cut into pieces. Each person who is so fortunate as to procure it
carries away a morsel of the flesh, and presents it to the idol of his
own village.&rdquo;
Concerning a method of sacrifice, which is illustrated by the post
preserved in the Madras Museum, Colonel [<a id=
"pb376" href="#pb376" name="pb376">376]Campbell
records<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5516src" href="#xd21e5516" name=
"xd21e5516src">166 that &ldquo;one of the most common ways of
offering the sacrifice in Chinna Kimedi is to the effigy of an elephant
(hatti mundo or elephant&rsquo;s head) rudely carved in wood, fixed on
the top of a stout post, on which it is made to revolve. After the
performance of the usual ceremonies, the intended victim is fastened to
the proboscis of the elephant, and, amidst the shouts and yells of the
excited multitude of Khonds, is rapidly whirled round, when, at a given
signal by the officiating Zanee or priest, the crowd rush in, seize the
Meriah, and with their knives cut the flesh off the shrieking wretch as
long as life remains. He is then cut down, the skeleton burnt, and the
horrid orgies are over. In several villages I counted as many as
fourteen effigies of elephants, which had been used in former
sacrifices. These I caused to be overthrown by the baggage elephants
attached to my camp in the presence of the assembled Khonds, to show
them that these venerated objects had no power against the living
animal, and to remove all vestiges of their bloody superstition.&rdquo;
In another report, Colonel Campbell describes how the miserable victim
is dragged along the fields, surrounded by a crowd of half intoxicated
Khonds, who, shouting and screaming, rush upon him, and with their
knives cut the flesh piecemeal from the bones, avoiding the head and
bowels, till the living skeleton, dying from loss of blood, is relieved
from torture, when its remains are burnt, and the ashes mixed with the
new grain to preserve it from insects.&rdquo; Yet again, he describes a
sacrifice which was peculiar to the Khonds of Jeypore. &ldquo;It
is,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;always succeeded by the sacrifice of three
human beings, two to the sun to the east and west of the village, and
one in the centre, [<a id="pb377" href="#pb377"
name="pb377">377]with the usual barbarities of the Meriah. A
stout wooden post about six feet long is firmly fixed in the ground, at
the foot of it a narrow grave is dug, and to the top of the post the
victim is firmly fastened by the long hair of his head. Four assistants
hold his outstretched arms and legs, the body being suspended
horizontally over the grave, with the face towards the earth. The
officiating Junna or priest, standing on the right side, repeats the
following invocation, at intervals hacking with his sacrificial knife
the back part of the shrieking victim&rsquo;s neck. &lsquo;O! mighty
Manicksoro, this is your festal day. To the Khonds the offering is
Meriah, to kings Junna. On account of this sacrifice, you have given to
kings kingdoms, guns and swords. The sacrifice we now offer you must
eat, and we pray that our battle-axes may be converted into swords, our
bows and arrows into gunpowder and balls; and, if we have any quarrels
with other tribes, give us the victory. Preserve us from the tyranny of
kings and their officers.&rsquo; Then, addressing the
victim:&mdash;&lsquo;That we may enjoy prosperity, we offer you a
sacrifice to our God Manicksoro, who will immediately eat you, so be
not grieved at our slaying you. Your parents were aware, when we
purchased you from them for sixty rupees, that we did so with intent to
sacrifice you. There is, therefore, no sin on our heads, but on your
parents. After you are dead, we shall perform your obsequies.&rsquo;
The victim is then decapitated, the body thrown into the grave, and the
head left suspended from the post till devoured by wild beasts. The
knife remains fastened to the post till the three sacrifices have been
performed, when it is removed with much ceremony. In an account by
Captain Mac Viccar of the sacrifice as carried out at Eaji Deso, it is
stated that on the day of sacrifice the Meriah is surrounded by the
Khonds, who [<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378]beat him violently on the head with the heavy
metal bangles which they purchase at the fairs, and wear on these
occasions. If this inhuman smashing does not immediately destroy the
victim&rsquo;s life, an end is put to his sufferings by strangulation,
a slit bamboo being used for the purpose. Strips of flesh are then cut
off the back, and each recipient of the precious treasure carries his
portion to the stream which waters his fields, and there suspends it on
a pole. The remains of the mangled corpse are then buried, and funeral
obsequies are performed seven days subsequently, and repeated one year
afterwards.&rdquo;

Meriah Sacrifice Post.

The Kondhs of Bara Mootah promised to relinquish the rite on
condition, inter alia, that they should be at liberty to
sacrifice buffaloes, monkeys, goats, etc., to their deities with all
the solemnities observed on occasions of human sacrifice; and that they
should be at liberty, upon all occasions, to denounce to their gods the
Government, and some of its servants in particular, as the cause of
their having relinquished the great rite.
The last recorded Meriah sacrifice in the Ganjam M&#257;liahs
occurred in 1852, and there are still Kondhs alive, who were present at
it. Twenty-five descendants of persons who were reserved for sacrifice,
but were rescued by Government officers, returned themselves as Meriah
at the census, 1901. The Kondhs have now substituted a buffalo for a
human being. The animal is hewn to pieces while alive, and the
villagers rush home to their villages, to bury the flesh in the soil,
and so secure prosperous crops. The sacrifice is not unaccompanied by
risk to the performers, as the buffalo, before dying, frequently kills
one or more of its tormenters. This was the case near Baliguda in 1899,
when a buffalo killed the sacrificer. In the previous year, the desire
of a village to intercept the bearer of the flesh for a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379]neighbouring village led to a fight, in which
two men were killed.
It was the practice, a few years ago, at every Dassara festival in
Jeypore, Vizagapatam, to select a specially fine ram, wash it, shave
its head, affix thereto red and white bottu and n&#257;mam (sect marks)
between the eyes and down the nose, and gird it with a new white cloth
after the manner of a human being. The animal being then fastened in a
sitting posture, certain p&#363;ja (worship) was performed by a
Br&#257;hman priest, and it was decapitated. The substitution of
animals for human victims is indicated by various religious legends.
Thus, a hind was substituted for Iphigenia, and a ram for Isaac.
It was stated by the officers of the Meriah Agency that there was
reason to believe that the R&#257;ja of Jeypore, when he was installed
on his father&rsquo;s death in 1860&ndash;61, sacrificed a girl
thirteen years of age at the shrine of the goddess Durga in the town of
Jeypore.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5542src" href="#xd21e5542" name=
"xd21e5542src">167 It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam
district (1907), that &ldquo;goats and buffaloes now-a-days take the
place of human Meriah victims, but the belief in the superior efficacy
of the latter dies hard, and every now and again revives. When the
Rampa rebellion of 1879&ndash;80 spread in this district, several cases
of human sacrifice occurred in the disturbed tracts. In 1880, two
persons were convicted of attempting a Meriah sacrifice near
Ambad&#257;la in Bissamkatak. In 1883, a man (a beggar and a stranger)
was found at daybreak murdered in one of the temples in Jeypore, in
circumstances which pointed to his having been slain as a Meriah; and,
as late as 1886, a formal enquiry showed that there were ample grounds
for the suspicion that the kidnapping of victims <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name=
"pb380">380]still went on in Bastar.&rdquo; As recently as
1902, a petition was presented to the District Magistrate of Ganjam,
asking him to sanction the performance of a human sacrifice. The memory
of the abandoned practice is kept green by one of the Kondh songs, for
a translation of which we are indebted to Mr. J. E.
Friend-Pereira.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5547src" href="#xd21e5547"

&ldquo;At the time of the great Kiabon (Campbell)
Sahib&rsquo;s coming, the country was in darkness; it was enveloped in
mist.
Having sent paiks to collect the people of the land, they, having
surrounded them, caught the Meriah sacrificers.
Having caught the Meriah sacrificers, they brought them, and again
they went and seized the evil councillors.
Having seen the chains and shackles, the people were afraid; murder
and bloodshed were quelled.
Then the land became beautiful, and a certain Mokodella (Macpherson)
Sahib came.
He destroyed the lairs of the tigers and bears in the hills and
rocks, and taught wisdom to the people.
After the lapse of a month, he built bungalows and schools; and he
advised them to learn reading and law.
They learnt wisdom and reading; they acquired silver and gold. Then
all the people became wealthy.&rdquo;

Human sacrifice was not practiced in the Kurtilli Muttah of the
Ganjam M&#257;liahs. The reason of this is assigned to the fact that
the first attempt was made with a crooked knife, and the sacrificers
made such a bad business of it that they gave it up. Colonel Campbell
gives another tradition, that, through humanity, one of the Kurtilli
P&#257;tros (head of a group of villages) threatened to leave the
muttah if the practice was carried out. [<a id=

Of a substituted sacrifice, which was carried out in the Ganjam
M&#257;liahs in 1894,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5573src" href=
"#xd21e5573" name="xd21e5573src">169 the following graphic account
has been given. &ldquo;Suddenly we came upon a number of Khonds
carrying an immensely long bamboo, about fifty feet in length,
surmounted by a gorgeous sort of balloon made of red and white cloth
stretched on a bamboo frame. Attached to this were dried strips of
pig&rsquo;s flesh, and the whole of the extraordinary structure was
surmounted by a huge plume of peacock&rsquo;s feathers that waved gaily
in the breeze. Along with this was carried another bamboo, not so long,
slung all over with iron bells. We found that the men had been
worshipping, and presenting these structures to a sylvan deity close
by, and were now hastening to the small Khond village of Dhuttiegaum,
the scene of the present Meriah sacrifice. Half a mile brought us to
this hamlet, situated amongst a dense grove of trees, in the midst of
which was tied to a curiously fluted and carved wooden post the
sacrificial buffalo, a placid animal, with its body glistening with the
oil of many anointings. The huge bamboo pole, with its crown of red and
white cloth and peacock&rsquo;s feathers, and incongruous shreds of
dried pig&rsquo;s flesh, was now erected in the centre of the village.
The comparative quiet in the village did not last long, for on a sudden
the air was rent with a succession of shrieks. With the sound of the
beating of M&#257;liah drums, and the blowing of buffalo horns, a party
of Khonds came madly dancing and rushing down a steep hillside from
some neighbouring village. They dashed up to the buffalo, and began
frantically dancing with the villagers already assembled round and
round the animal. Each man carried a green bough of some tree, a sharp
knife, and a tanghi. They [<a id="pb382" href=
"#pb382" name="pb382">382]were all adorned in holiday
attire, their hair combed and knotted on the forehead, and profusely
decorated with waving feathers. All of them were more or less
intoxicated. Various other villagers now began to arrive, thick and
fast, in the same manner, with wavings of green boughs, flourishing of
knives, and hideous yells. Each party was led by the headman or Moliko
of the village. The dancing now became more general, and faster and
more furious, as more and more joined the human &lsquo;merry go
round,&rsquo; circling about the unfortunate buffalo. The women, who
had followed their lords and masters at a discreet distance, stood
sedately by in a group, and took no part whatever in the revels. They
were for the most part fine buxom girls, well groomed and oiled, and
stood demurely watching everything with their sharp black eyes. The
hitherto quiet buffalo, who for nearly two days had been without food
and water, now began to get excited, and, straining at its tether,
plunged and butted at the dancers, catching one man neatly on the nose
so that the blood flowed copiously. However, the Khonds were too
excited to care, and circled round and round the poor maddened brute,
singing and blowing horns into its ears, beating drums, and every now
and then offering it cakes brought with them from their villages, and
then laying them on the top of the post as offerings. As they thus
madly careered about, we had ample time to note their extraordinary
costumes. One man had somehow got hold of an old blue Police overcoat,
which he had put on inside out, and round his waist he had gathered
what seemed to be a number of striped tent carpets, forming a stiff
ballet skirt or kilt. He was one of the most athletic in spinning round
the buffalo, flourishing a kitchen chopper. Another man&rsquo;s costume
consisted of almost nothing at all. He [<a id=
"pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383]had, however,
profusely daubed his body with white and black spots, and on his head
he had centred all his decorative genius. The head in question was
swathed in yards of cloth, terminating at the back in a perfect cascade
of cock&rsquo;s feathers. He excitedly waved over this erection an
ancient and very rusty umbrella, with many ventilations, with streamers
of white cloth attached to the top. Others had tied on to their heads
with bands of cloth the horns of buffaloes, or brass horns made in
imitation of those of the spotted deer. Their long, black and curly
hair hung in masses from beneath this strange erection, giving them a
most startling appearance. The dancing round the buffalo lasted quite
two hours, as they were waiting for the arrival of the P&#257;tro,
before concluding the final ceremonies, and the great man was
fashionably late. To incite their jaded energies to further
terpsichorean efforts, from time to time the dancers drank copious
draughts of a kind of beer, used specially on these occasions, and made
from kukuri, a species of grain. At last, the long expected P&#257;tro
arrived with the usual uproar of many deafening sounds, both artificial
and natural, and with the waving of green boughs. On this occasion he
walked last, while the whole of his retinue preceded him dancing,
headed by an ancient and withered hag, carrying on her shoulders a
M&#257;liah drum of cow-hide stretched tightly over a hoop of iron, and
vigorously beaten from behind her by a Khond with stiff thongs of dried
leather. The great man himself walked sedately, followed by his
&lsquo;charger,&rsquo; a broken-kneed tat (pony), extraordinarily
caparisoned, and led by a youth of tender years, whose sole garment
consisted of a faded red drummer&rsquo;s coat of antiquated cut. As
soon as the P&#257;tro had seated himself comfortably on a log near the
dancers, a change came over the scene. [<a id=
"pb384" href="#pb384" name="pb384">384]The hitherto shouting
and madly revolving throng stopped their gyrations round the stupefied
beast, too much exhausted and frightened to offer any resistance, and,
falling on its neck and body, began to smother it with caresses and
endearments, and, to a low plaintive air, crooned and wailed over it,
the following dirge, of which I append a rude translation. Tradition
says that they used to sing it, with slight variations, over their
human victims before the sacrifice:&mdash;


Blame us not, O buffalo!
Thus for sacrificing thee,
For our fathers have ordained
This ancient mystery.


We have bought thee with a price,
Have paid for thee all thy worth.
What blame can rest upon us,
Who save our land from dearth?


Famine stares us in the face,
Parched are our fields, and dry,
Death looks in at ev&rsquo;ry door,
For food our young ones cry.


Thadi Pennoo veils her face,
Propitiate me, she cries,
Give to me of flesh and blood,
A willing sacrifice.


That where&rsquo;er its blood is shed,
On land, or field, or hill,
There the gen&rsquo;rous grain may spring,
So ye may eat your fill.


Then be glad, O buffalo!
Willing sacrifice to be,
Soon in Thadi&rsquo;s meadows green,
Thou shalt brouse eternally.


After the Khonds had been chanting this sacrificial
hymn for some time, the buffalo was untied from the carved <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385]post, and led, with singing, dancing and
shouting, and with the noise of many musical instruments, to a sacred
grove a few hundred yards off, and there tied to a stake. As soon as it
had been firmly tied, the Khonds threw off all their superfluous
clothing to the large crowd of womankind waiting near, and stood round
the animal, each man with his hand uplifted, and holding a sharp knife
ready to strike at a moment&rsquo;s notice, as soon as the priest or
Janni had given the word of command. The Janni, who did not differ
outwardly from the others, now gave the buffalo a slight tap on the
head with a small axe. An indescribable scene followed. The Khonds in a
body fell on the animal, and, in an amazingly short time, literally
tore the living victim to shreds with their knives, leaving nothing but
the head, bones, and stomach. Death must, mercifully, have been almost
instantaneous. Every particle of flesh and skin had been stripped off
during the few minutes they fought and struggled over the buffalo,
eagerly grasping for every atom of flesh. As soon as a man had secured
a piece of flesh, he rushed away with the gory mass, as fast as he
could, to his fields, to bury it therein according to ancient custom,
before the sun had set. As some of them had to do good distances to
effect this, it was imperative that they should run very fast. A
curious scene now took place, for which we could obtain no explanation.
As the men ran, all the women flung after them clods of earth, some of
them taking very good effect. The sacred grove was cleared of people,
save a few that guarded the remnants left of the buffalo, which were
taken, and burnt with ceremony at the foot of the stake.&rdquo;
I pass on to the subject of infanticide among the Kondhs. It is
stated, in the Manual of the Vizagapatam district, that female
infanticide used to be very common all over the Jeypore country, and
the R&#257;jah is said to [<a id="pb386" href=
"#pb386" name="pb386">386]have made money out of it in one
large t&#257;luk (division). The custom was to consult the D&#257;sari
(priest) when a child was born as to its fate. If it was to be killed,
the parents had to pay the Am&#299;n of the t&#257;luk a fee for the
privilege of killing it; and the Am&#299;n used to pay the R&#257;jah
three hundred rupees a year for renting the privilege of giving the
license and pocketing the fees. The practice of female infanticide was
formerly very prevalent among the Kondhs of Ganjam, and, in 1841,
Lieutenant Macpherson was deputed to carry into effect the measures
which had been proposed by Lord Elphinstone for the suppression of the
Meriah sacrifices and infanticide. The custom was ascribed to various
beliefs, viz., (1) that it was an injunction by god, as one woman made
the whole world suffer; (2) that it conduces to male offspring; (3)
that woman, being a mischief-maker, is better out of the world than in
it; (4) that the difficulty, owing to poverty, in providing marriage
portions was an objection to rearing females. From Macpherson&rsquo;s
well known report<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5645src" href="#xd21e5645"
name="xd21e5645src">170 the following extracts are taken.
&ldquo;The portion of the Khond country, in which the practice of
female infanticide is known to prevail, is roughly estimated at 2,400
square miles, its population at 60,000, and the number of infants
destroyed annually at 1,200 to 1,500. The tribes (who practice
infanticide) belong to the division of the Khond people which does not
offer human sacrifices. The usage of infanticide has existed amongst
them from time immemorial. It owes its origin and its maintenance
partly to religious opinions, partly to ideas from which certain very
important features of Khond manners arise. The Khonds believe that the
supreme deity, the sun god, created all things <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387]good; that the earth goddess introduced evil
into the world; and that these two powers have since conflicted. The
non-sacrificing tribes make the supreme deity the great object of their
adoration, neglecting the earth goddess. The sacrificing tribes, on the
other hand, believe the propitiation of the latter power to be the most
necessary worship. Now the tribes which practice female infanticide
hold that the sun god, in contemplating the deplorable effects produced
by the creation of feminine nature, charged men to bring up only as
many females as they could restrain from producing evil to society.
This is the first idea upon which the usage is founded. Again, the
Khonds believe that souls almost invariably return to animate human
forms in the families in which they have been first born and received.
But the reception of the soul of an infant into a family is completed
only on the performance of the ceremony of naming upon the seventh day
after its birth. The death of a female infant, therefore, before that
ceremonial of reception, is believed to exclude its soul from the
circle of family spirits, diminishing by one the chance of future
female births in the family. And, as the first aspiration of every
Khond is to have male children, this belief is a powerful incentive to
infanticide.&rdquo; Macpherson, during his campaign, came across many
villages of about a hundred houses, in which there was not a single
female child. In like manner, in 1855, Captain Frye found many Baro
Bori Khond villages without a single female child in them.
In savage societies, it has been said, sexual unions were generally
effected by the violent capture of the woman. By degrees these captures
have become friendly ones, and have ended in a peaceful exogamy,
retaining the ancient custom only in the ceremonial form. Whereof an
excellent example is afforded by the Kondhs, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388]concerning whom the author of the Ganjam Manual
writes as follows. &ldquo;The parents arrange the marriages of their
children. The bride is looked upon as a commercial speculation, and is
paid for in gontis. A gonti is one of anything, such as a buffalo, a
pig, or a brass pot; for instance, a hundred gontis might consist of
ten bullocks, ten buffaloes, ten sacks of corn, ten sets of brass,
twenty sheep, ten pigs, and thirty fowls. The usual price, however,
paid by the bridegroom&rsquo;s father for the bride, is twenty or
thirty gontis. A Khond finds his wife from among the women of any
mut&#257;h (village) than his own. On the day fixed for the bride being
taken home to her husband&rsquo;s house, the pieces of broom in her
ears are removed, and are replaced by brass rings. The bride is covered
over with a red blanket, and carried astride on her uncle&rsquo;s back
towards the husband&rsquo;s village, accompanied by the young women of
her own village. Music is played, and in the rear are carried brass
playthings, such as horses, etc., for the bridegroom, and cloths and
brass pins as presents for the bridegroom from the bride&rsquo;s
father. On the road, at the village boundary, the procession is met by
the bridegroom and the young men of his village, with their heads and
bodies wrapped up in blankets and cloths. Each is armed with a bundle
of long thin bamboo sticks. The young women of the bride&rsquo;s
village at once attack the bridegroom&rsquo;s party with sticks,
stones, and clods of earth, which the young men ward off with the
bamboo sticks. A running fight is in this manner kept up until the
village is reached, when the stone-throwing invariably ceases, and the
bridegroom&rsquo;s uncle, snatching up the bride, carries her off to
her husband&rsquo;s house. This fighting is by no means child&rsquo;s
play, and the men are sometimes seriously injured. The whole party is
then entertained by the bridegroom [<a id="pb389"
href="#pb389" name="pb389">389]as lavishly as his means will
permit. On the day after the bride&rsquo;s arrival, a buffalo and a pig
are slaughtered and eaten, and, upon the bride&rsquo;s attendants
returning home on the evening of the second day, a male and female
buffalo, or some less valuable present, is given to them. On the third
day, all the Khonds of the village have a grand dance or tam&#257;sha
(festivity), and on the fourth day there is another grand assembly at
the house of the bridegroom. The bride and bridegroom are then made to
sit down on a cot, and the bridegroom&rsquo;s brother, pointing upwards
to the roof of the house, says: &ldquo;As long as this girl stays with
us, may her children be as men and tigers; but, if she goes astray, may
her children be as snakes and monkeys, and die and be destroyed!&rdquo;
In his report upon the Kondhs (1842), Macpherson tells us that
&ldquo;they hold a feast at the bride&rsquo;s house. Far into the night
the principals in the scene are raised by an uncle of each upon his
shoulders, and borne through the dance. The burdens are suddenly
exchanged, and the uncle of the youth disappears with the bride. The
assembly divides itself into two parties. The friends of the bride
endeavour to arrest, those of the bridegroom to cover her flight, and
men, women, and children mingle in mock conflict. I saw a man bearing
away upon his back something enveloped in an ample covering of scarlet
cloth. He was surrounded by twenty or thirty young fellows, and by them
protected from the desperate attacks made upon him by a party of young
women. The man was just married, and the burden was his blooming bride,
whom he was conveying to his own village. Her youthful friends were,
according to custom, seeking to regain possession of her, and hurled
stones and bamboos at the head of the devoted bridegroom, until he
reached the confines of his own village. Then the tables were
[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390]turned, and the bride was fairly won; and off
her young friends scampered, screaming and laughing, but not relaxing
their speed till they reached their own village.&rdquo; Among the
Kondhs of Gums&#363;r, the friends and relations of the bride and
bridegroom collect at an appointed spot. The people of the female
convoy call out to the others to come and take the bride, and then a
mock fight with stones and thorny brambles is begun by the female
convoy against the parties composing the other one. In the midst of the
tumult the assaulted party takes possession of the bride, and all the
furniture brought with her, and carry all off together.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5658src" href="#xd21e5658" name=
"xd21e5658src">171 According to another account, the bride, as soon
as she enters the bridegroom&rsquo;s house, has two enormous bracelets,
or rather handcuffs of brass, each weighing from twenty to thirty
pounds, attached to each wrist. The unfortunate girl has to sit with
her two wrists resting on her shoulders, so as to support these
enormous weights. This is to prevent her from running away to her old
home. On the third day the bangles are removed, as it is supposed that
by then the girl has become reconciled to her fate. These marriage
bangles are made on the hills, and are curiously carved in fluted and
zigzag lines, and kept as heirlooms in the family, to be used at the
next marriage in the house. According to a still more recent account of
marriage among the Kondhs<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5661src" href=
"#xd21e5661" name="xd21e5661src">172 an old woman suddenly rushes
forward, seizes the bride, flings her on her back, and carries her off.
A man comes to the front, catches the groom, and places him astride on
his shoulder. The human horses neigh and prance about like the live
quadruped, and finally rush away to the outskirts of the village. This
is a signal for [<a id="pb391" href="#pb391"
name="pb391">391]the bride&rsquo;s girl friends to chase the
couple, and pelt them with clods of earth, stones, mud, cowdung, and
rice. When the mock assault is at an end, the older people come up, and
all accompany the bridal pair to the groom&rsquo;s village. A
correspondent informs me that he once saw a Kondh bride going to her
new home, riding on her uncle&rsquo;s shoulders, and wrapped in a red
blanket. She was followed by a bevy of girls and relations, and
preceded by drums and horns. He was told that the uncle had to carry
her the whole way, and that, if he had to put her down, a fine of a
buffalo was inflicted, the animal being killed and eaten. It is
recorded that a European magistrate once mistook a Kondh marriage for a
riot, but, on enquiry, discovered his mistake.
Reference has been made above to certain brass playthings, which are
carried in the bridal procession. The figures include peacocks,
cham&aelig;leons, cobras, crabs, horses, deer, tigers, cocks,
elephants, human beings, musicians, etc. They are cast by the cire
perdue process. The core of the figure is roughly shaped in clay,
according to the usual practice, but, instead of laying on the wax in
an even thickness, thin wax threads are first made, and arranged over
the core so as to form a network, or placed in parallel lines or
diagonally, according as the form of the figure or fancy of the workman
dictates. The head, arms, and feet are modelled in the ordinary way.
The wax threads are made by means of a bamboo tube, into the end of
which a moveable brass plate is fitted. The wax, being made
sufficiently soft by heat, is pressed through the perforation at the
end of the tube, and comes out in the form of long threads, which must
be used by the workmen before they become hard and brittle. The chief
place where these figures are made is Belugunta, near Russellkonda in
[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392]Ganjam. It is noted by Mr. J. A. R.
Stevenson<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5674src" href="#xd21e5674" name=
"xd21e5674src">173 that the Kondhs of Gums&#363;r, to represent
their deities Jara Pennu, the Linga D&#275;vata, or Petri D&#275;vata,
keep in their houses brass figures of elephants, peacocks, dolls,
fishes, etc. If affliction happens to any one belonging to the
household, or if the country skin eruption breaks out on any of them,
they put rice into milk, and, mixing turmeric with it, sprinkle the
mixture on the figures, and, killing fowls and sheep, cause worship to
be made by the J&#257;ni, and, making b&#257;ji, eat.
At a marriage among the Kondhs of Baliguda, after the heads of the
bride and bridegroom have been brought together, an arrow is discharged
from a bow by the younger brother of the bridegroom into the grass roof
of the hut. At the betrothal ceremony of some Kondhs, a buffalo and pig
are killed, and some of the viscera eaten. Various parts are
distributed according to an abiding rule, viz., the head to the
bridegroom&rsquo;s maternal uncle, the flesh of the sides to his
sisters, and of the back among other relations and friends. Some Kondh
boys of ten or twelve years of age are said to be married to girls of
fifteen or sixteen. At Shubernagiri, in the Ganjam M&#257;liahs, are
two trysting trees, consisting of a j&#257;k (Artocarpus
integrifolia) and mango growing close together. The custom was for
a Kondh, who was unable to pay the marriage fees to the P&#257;tro
(headman), to meet his love here by night and plight his troth, and
then for the two to retire into the jungle for three days and nights
before returning to the village. Afterwards, they were considered to be
man and wife.
It is noted by Mr. Friend-Pereira<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5685src" href="#xd21e5685" name="xd21e5685src">174 that, at
the ceremonial for settling the preliminaries of a Kondh <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393]marriage, a knotted string is put into the hands
of the s&#275;rid&#257;hpa g&#257;t&#257;ru (searchers for the bride),
and a similar string is kept by the girl&rsquo;s people. The reckoning
of the date of the betrothal ceremony is kept by undoing a knot in the
string every morning.
Some years ago, a young Kondh was betrothed to the daughter of
another Kondh, and, after a few years, managed to pay up the necessary
number of gifts. He then applied to the girl&rsquo;s father to name the
day for the marriage. Before the wedding took place, however, a
P&#257;no went to the girl&rsquo;s father, and said that she was his
daughter (she had been born before her parents were married), and that
he was the man to whom the gifts should have been paid. The case was
referred to a council meeting, which decided in favour of the
P&#257;no.
Of birth ceremonies, the following account is given by Mr. Jayaram
Moodaliar. The woman is attended in her confinement by an elderly Kondh
midwife, who shampooes her abdomen with castor-oil. The umbilical cord
is cut by the mother of the infant. For this purpose, the right thigh
of the baby is flexed towards its abdomen, and a piece of cooled
charcoal placed on its right knee. The cord is placed on the charcoal,
and divided with the sharp edge of an arrow. The placenta is buried
close to the house near a wall. After the cord has been severed, the
mother daubs the region of the infant&rsquo;s navel with her saliva,
over which she smears castor-oil. She then warms her hands at a fire,
and applies them to the infant&rsquo;s body. [It is stated, in the
Ganjam Manual, that the infant is held before a hot fire, and half
roasted.] The warming is repeated several times daily for four or five
days. When the umbilical cord has sloughed off, a spider is burnt to
ashes over a fire, placed in a cocoanut shell, mixed with castor-oil,
and applied by means of a [<a id="pb394" href=
"#pb394" name="pb394">394]fowl&rsquo;s feather to the navel.
The infant&rsquo;s head is shaved, except over the anterior fontanelle,
the hair from which is removed after about a month. Its body is smeared
all over daily with castor-oil and <span class="corr" id="xd21e5697"
title="Source: tumeric">turmeric paste until it is a month old.
The mother then goes with her baby and husband to her brother&rsquo;s
house, where the infant is presented with a fowl, which is taken home,
and eaten by her husband. The appropriation of the fowl varies
according to the locality. In some places, the infant&rsquo;s father,
and other relations, except the mother, may eat it, and, in others,
both its parents, and relations living in the house, may do so. In
still other places, the father, paternal grandfather and grandmother,
and paternal uncle, may partake of it.
The naming ceremony among the Kondhs of Gums&#363;r is thus
described by Mr. J. A. R. Stevenson. &ldquo;Six months after birth, on
a fixed day, they make g&#257;duthuva (the ceremony of naming the
child). On that day, killing a dog, and procuring liquor, they make
b&#257;ji. They wash the feet of the child. The J&#257;ni being come,
he ties a cord from the haft to the point of a sickle, and they divine
by means of it. Having assembled the petrilu (literally ancestors, but
here denoting household images or gods), they put rice on the sickle.
As the names (of the ancestors or family?) are repeated in order, each
time the rice is put on, that name is chosen on the mention of which
the sickle moves, and is given to the child. They then drink liquor,
and eat b&#257;ji. They give rice and flesh to the
J&#257;ni.&rdquo;
Of death ceremonies, the following account is given in the manual of
the Ganjam district. &ldquo;Immediately after death, a cloth is wrapped
round the corpse, but no cloths or valuables are removed. A portion of
paddy (unhusked rice), and all the cooking utensils of the deceased are
[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395]given to the village Sitra. [The Sitras
manufacture the brass rings and bangles worn by the Kondhs.] The body
is then burnt. On the following day, a little rice is cooked, put on a
dish, and laid on the spot where the corpse was burnt. An incantation
is then pronounced, requesting the spirit of the deceased person to eat
the rice and enjoy itself, and not to change itself into a devil or
tiger, and come bothering the survivors in the village. Three days
after death, the madda ceremony is performed. An effigy of the deceased
is prepared of straw, which is stuck up in front of or on the roof of
the house, and the relations and friends assemble, lament, and eat at
the expense of the people of the deceased&rsquo;s house. Each person
brings a present of some kind or other, and, on his departure on the
next day, receives something of slightly higher value. The death of a
man in a village requires a purification, which is made by the
sacrifice of a buffalo on the seventh day after death. If a man is
killed by a tiger, the purification is made by the sacrifice of a pig,
the head of which, cut off with a tangi (axe) by a P&#257;no, is passed
between the legs of the men in the village, who stand in a line
astraddle. It is a bad omen for him if the head touches any man&rsquo;s
legs. If the P&#257;tro attends a funeral, he gets a fee of a goat for
firing his gun, to drive away the dead man&rsquo;s ghost.&rdquo;
According to Mr. Jayaram Moodaliar, if a person is killed by a tiger,
the head of the decapitated pig is placed in a stream, and, as it
floats down, it has to pass between the legs of the villagers. If it
touches the legs of any of them, it forebodes that he will be killed by
a tiger.
In a note on the death ceremonies in Gums&#363;r, Mr. J. A. R.
Stevenson writes as follows. &ldquo;On life ceasing, they tie a sheep
to the foot of the corpse. They carry the clothes, brass eating-dish,
brass drinking-vessel, [<a id="pb396" href=
"#pb396" name="pb396">396]ornaments, grain in store, and the
said sheep to the burning-ground. Having burned the body, and gone
around about the pile, they leave all those things there, and, beating
drums, return home. The garments the P&#257;nos take away. They procure
liquor, and drink it. They then go to their respective houses, and eat.
On the next day, they kill a she-buffalo, and get together a great
quantity of liquor. The whole of the tribe (near and distant relations)
being assembled, they make b&#257;ji, and eat. They beat drums. If the
deceased were of any consequence, dancers come and dance to the sound
of the drums, to whom some animal is given, which they take, and go
away. Subsequently, on the twelfth day, they carry a hog to the spot
where the body was burned, and, after perambulating the site of the
pyre, return to their home, where they kill a hog in the place set
apart for their household gods, and, procuring liquor, make baji, the
members of the tribe eating together. Should a tiger carry off any one,
they throw out of doors all the (preserved) flesh belonging to him, and
all the people of the village, not excepting children, quit their
homes. The J&#257;ni, being come with two rods of the tummeca tree
(Acacia arabica), he plants these in the earth,
and then, bringing one rod of the condatamara tree (<i lang=
"la-x-bio">Smilax macrophylla), he places it transversely across
the other two. The J&#257;ni, performing some incantation, sprinkles
water on them. Beginning with the children, as these and the people
pass through the passage so formed, the J&#257;ni sprinkles water on
them all. Afterwards, the whole of them go to their houses, without
looking behind them.&rdquo;
In connection with customs observed in the event of death, Mr.
Jayaram Moodaliar writes that &ldquo;if a woman&rsquo;s husband dies,
she removes the beads from her neck, the [<a id=
"pb397" href="#pb397" name="pb397">397]metal finger rings,
ankle and wrist ornaments, and the ornament worn in the lobe of one
ear, that worn in the lobe of the other ear being retained. These are
thrown on the chest of the corpse, before it is cremated. The widow
does not remove the ornaments worn in the helices of the ears, and in
the al&aelig; and septum of the nose. When a Khond dies, his body is
cremated. The people in the house of the deceased are not allowed to
cook their food on that or the next day, but are fed by their relations
and friends in the village. On the day after death, rice and a fowl are
cooked separately, put in big leaf cups, and placed on the spot where
the corpse was burnt. The spirit of the deceased is invited to eat the
meal, and asked not to do them any harm. On the third day, the
relations bathe, and smear their heads with clay. An effigy of the
deceased is made, and stuck up on the roof of the house. The practice
of making an image of the deceased obtains among the Gooms&#363;r
Khonds, but, in some other places, is considered inauspicious. On the
seventh day, a purificatory ceremony is gone through, and a buffalo
killed, with which, and the indispensable liquor, the guests are
entertained. At a village two miles from Baliguda, a boy, about sixteen
years old, died. His gold ear-rings and silver bracelets were not
removed, but burnt. His cloths were thrown on the pyre. R&#257;gi and
other grains, paddy, etc., were placed near the funeral pyre, but not
in the fire. The food-stuffs, and a buffalo, were divided among the
Haddis, who are the servants of the headman (P&#257;tro) of the muttah.
They also took the remains of the jewels, recovered from the ashes
after cremation.&rdquo;
It is recorded by Mr. F. Fawcett<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5722src"
href="#xd21e5722" name="xd21e5722src">175 that &ldquo;once after
death, a propitiatory sacrifice is made of animals of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href="#pb398" name=
"pb398">398]deceased to the Pid&#257;ri Pitta (ancestor) for
the sake of the deceased&rsquo;s spirit, which, after this festive
introduction to the shades, must take its chance. A curious ceremony,
which I do not remember seeing noted anywhere, is performed the day
after death. Some boiled rice and a small fowl are taken to the burning
place. The fowl is split down the breast, and placed on the spot; it is
afterwards eaten, and the soul is invoked to enter a new-Aborn
child.&rdquo;
The following note on a Kondh funeral dance in the Ganjam
M&#257;liahs is from the pen of an eye-witness.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e5729src" href="#xd21e5729" name="xd21e5729src">176 &ldquo;The
dead P&#257;tro is, as usual, a hill Uriya, of ancient lineage, no less
than that of the great totem of nola bompsa or the ancestral
wood-pigeon that laid its eggs in the hollow of a bamboo, from which
this family sprang. Various and most interesting are the totems of the
M&#257;liahs. In passing, I may mention another curious totem, that of
the pea-fowl, two eggs of which a man brought home to his wife, who
laid them in an earthen pot, and from them sprang a man-child, the
progenitor of a famous family. But to return to the P&#257;tro. Before
sunset, mourned by his two wives, the younger and favourite one
carrying a young child of light bamboo colour, he had been burnt,
without much ceremony, in an open grassy spot, his ashes scattered to
the four winds of heaven, and the spot marked by wooden posts driven
deep into the soil. Not now would be celebrated the funeral obsequies,
but a month hence on the accession of his eldest son, the future
P&#257;tro, a fair lad of eighteen years. As the day for the obsequies
drew near, an unusual bustle filled the air. Potters from the low
country arrived, and hundreds upon hundreds of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399]earthen pots of all sizes and shapes were
turned, and piled in great heaps near the village. Huge buffaloes,
unconscious of their approaching fate, lay tethered near, or wallowing
in bovine luxury in a swamp hard by. Messengers had been sent far and
near to all the P&#257;tros, Molikos, and Bissoyis. Even the Kuttiya
Khonds were not left out. The auspicious morning at length dawned, when
a distinguished company began to arrive, each chief with his followers,
and in many cases his wives and little children, all dressed in their
best, and bent on enjoying everything to the utmost. I noticed fine
stalwart men from Udiagiri on the edge of the ghauts, together with
Khonds from more civilised Baliguda, and Khonds from cold and breezy
Daringabadi, cheerful in spite of the numbers of their relatives that
had found a horrid tomb inside a man-eating tiger that since 1886
(together with another ally lately started) had carried off more than
four hundred of their kith and kin. Distinguished amongst even that
wild horde for savagery were the Khonds from the Kuttiya country, who
live on tops of hills, and whose women are seldom, if ever, seen. These
are remarkable for their enormous quantities of frizzly hair tied in
huge chignons over the right brow, and decorated with feathers of every
hue&mdash;the jay, the parrot, the peacock and the white quills of the
paddy-bird predominating. Their short, sturdy limbs are hung in every
direction with necklaces and curious blue beads and cut agates, said to
be dug out of ancient burial places and cromlechs in Central India.
Certain it is that almost no inducement will prevail on a Khond to
voluntarily part with these precious heirlooms. As each fresh
detachment arrived, their first occupation was to go to a neighbouring
tank (pond), and, after a wash and decoration of head and hair with
either the orthodox [<a id="pb400" href="#pb400"
name="pb400">400]feathers, or, prettier still, with wreaths
of wild flowers, to repair to the late chief&rsquo;s house, and,
presenting themselves at the door, condole, with much vigour of lungs,
with the now less disconsolate widows on their recent loss. This
ceremony over, they tendered their allegiance to the young son of the
dead P&#257;tro, permitted by Government to take his place, and each
man received from him an earthen cooking-pot, and each circle of
villages a buffalo. The Khond is a beef eater, but a curious custom
prevails in some parts, that a married woman must abstain from the
flesh of a cow. These preliminary ceremonies over, the crowd adjourned,
with great noise of shouting, blowing of buffalo horns, and beating of
drums, to the open grassy spot marked by posts, where the late
P&#257;tro had been burned, and where a recently killed buffalo,
weltering in its gore, now lay. Among the throng of men, women and
children, most of the former more than slightly elevated by drinking
copious draughts of a kind of beer made from the kuhari grain, were
three Khonds carrying long poles surmounted by huge bunches of peacock
feathers that blazed in the sunlight like emeralds and sapphires. The
funeral dance now commenced. The dance itself is simple in the extreme,
for, when the right spot was reached, old men and young began gyrating
round and round in a large circle, a perfect human merry-go-round. The
old grey-beards, plodding slowly round the ring, and stamping on the
soil with their aged feet, presented a great contrast to the younger
and wilder men, who capered and pranced about, sometimes outside the
circle, waving their tanghis in the air, and every now and then leaping
up to the slain buffalo, and dipping their axes into its blood, and
then back again, dancing more wildly than ever, round and round from
west to east, till the [<a id="pb401" href=
"#pb401" name="pb401">401]eye ached to behold the perpetual
motion of this animated wheel. In the centre revolved the three men
with the huge bunches of peacock feathers afore-mentioned. When any
dropped out of the circle to rest there were many eager and willing to
take their places, and so, with relays of fresh dancers, this human
circle revolved on for three whole days, only ceasing at nightfall,
when by large fires the various tribes cooked in the earthen pots
provided the buffaloes presented by the new P&#257;tro. In olden days,
an animal was given to each village, but on this occasion only to a
circle of villages, occasioning thereby certain grumblings among the
wiseacres for the good old days of the past, when not only buffaloes in
plenty, but Meriah human victims as well were lavishly provided and
sacrificed. &lsquo;Ichabod,&rsquo; said they in Khond, &lsquo;the glory
of the M&#257;liahs hath departed.&rsquo; On the afternoon of the third
day, the P&#257;tros, Molikas, Bissoyis, and others of the great men
began to depart with their retainers for their distant homes in the
jungles, having had a thoroughly good time. The women, who had been
very shy at first, fled at my approach, now, after three days&rsquo;
familiarity with a white face, began to show symptoms of friendliness,
so that they allowed me to go quite near to them to examine their
pretty necklaces of coloured grasses, silver coins, and curious beads,
and to count the numbers of small sticks (generally about twelve or
fifteen) of broom that were arranged in the shape of a crescent round
the outer edges of the pierced ears of each unmarried village belle,
and to observe at close quarters the strange tattooed patterns in blue
of zigzag and curve that to my eyes disfigured their otherwise comely
faces. As to beauty of figure, I think very few can compare with a
young and well-grown Khond maiden, with her straight back and handsome
[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name=
"pb402">402]proportions. It was, therefore, without much
difficulty that I persuaded some of them to dance before me. Six buxom
girls stepped out, all of them the respectable daughters of well-to-do
Khonds, prepared to dance the famous peacock dance. Round their supple
but massive waists was twisted the strip of national Khond cloth of
blue, red and white, and for bodices what could be more becoming than
their glossy brown skins of nature&rsquo;s millinery, gracefully
wreathed with garlands of coloured grasses and strings of gay beads.
The polished jet black hair, neatly tied in a knot at the back, and
decorated with pretty lacquered and silver combs, or with forest
flowers, added yet more to their picturesque appearance. Each girl now
took a long strip of white cloth, and, winding it round her waist,
allowed one end to trail at the back in the fashion of a Liberty sash.
This was supposed to represent the tail of the peacock. Three of the
girls then faced the three others, and, with their left hands resting
on their hips, and their elbows sticking out (to represent the wings),
and the right arms extended in front with the fingers outstretched to
simulate the neck and beak, began to dance to the ear-piercing shrieks
of cracked trumpet, and to the deep beatings of a M&#257;liah drum
marking excellent time. On and on they danced, advancing and retiring,
and now and then crossing over (not unlike the first figure of the
quadrille), while their tinkling feet, &lsquo;like little mice, stole
in and out,&rsquo; the heels alternately clashing against each other,
in exact time to the music, and the lips gracefully waving from side to
side as they advanced or retired. There was perfect grace of movements
combined with extreme modesty, the large expressive eyes veiled by the
long lashes never once being raised, and the whole demeanour utterly
oblivious [<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403]to the crowd of enthusiastic admirers that
surrounded them on all sides. But for the wild scene around, the noise
and shrieking of instruments, and the fantastic dresses of the Khonds
(many of whom had buffalo horns tied on to their painted faces, or had
decorated their heads with immense wigs of long black hair), one might
easily have supposed these shrinking damsels to have been the pick of a
Mission School specially selected for propriety to dance the South
Indian kummi before, say, an itinerant Bishop of ascetic tendencies and
&aelig;sthetic temperament. When their heaving, panting bodies showed
that exhausted nature claimed them for her own, the man with the
trumpet or the drum would rush up, and blow or beat it almost under
their drooping heads, urging them with shouts and gesticulations to
further energy, till at length the shades of night crept over the
hills, and, with one accord, the dancing and the deafening music
ceased, while the six girls stole quietly back and were soon lost in
the crowd.&rdquo;
Of superstitions among the Kondhs, the following are recorded by Mr.
Jayaram Moodaliar:&mdash;

&ldquo;When a Kondh starts out on a shooting
expedition, if he first meets an adult female, married or unmarried, he
will return home, and ask a child to tell the females to keep out of
his way. He will then make a fresh start, and, if he meets a female,
will wave his hand to her as a sign that she must keep clear of him.
Before a party start out for shooting, they warn the females not to
come in their way. The Kondh believes that, if he sees a female, he
will not come across animals in the jungle to shoot. If a woman is in
her menses, her husband, brothers, and sons living under the same roof,
will not go out shooting for the same reason. <span class=
"pagenum">[404]
A Kondh will not leave his village when a j&#257;thra (festival) is
being celebrated, lest the god Pennu should visit his wrath on him.
They will not cut trees, which yield products suitable for human
consumption, such as the mango, j&#257;k, jambul (Eugenia
Jambolana), or iluppai (Bassia) from which they distil a
spirituous liquor. Even though these trees prevent the growth of a crop
in the fields, they will not cut them down.
If an owl hoots over the roof of a house, or on a tree close
thereto, it is considered unlucky, as foreboding a death in the family
at an early date. If an owl hoots close to a village, but outside it,
the death of one of the villagers will follow. For this reason, the
bird is pelted with stones, and driven off.
They will not kill a crow, as this would be a sin amounting to the
killing of a friend. According to their legend, soon after the creation
of the world there was a family consisting of an aged man and woman,
and four children, who died one after the other in quick succession.
Their parents were too aged to take the necessary steps for their
cremation, so they threw the bodies away on the ground, at some
distance from their home. God appeared to them in their dreams one
night, and promised that he would create the crow, so that it might
devour the dead bodies.
They do not consider it a sin to kill a Brahminy kite (Haliastur
indus: Garuda pakshi), which is held in veneration throughout
Southern India. A Kondh will kill it for so slight an offence as
carrying off his chickens.
They will not cut the crops with a sickle with a serrated edge, such
as is used by the Oriyas, but use a straight-edged knife. The crops,
after they have been cut, are removed to the village, and threshed by
hand, [<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405]and not with the help of cattle. While this is
being done, strangers (Kondh or others) may not look on the crop, or
speak to them, lest their evil eye should be cast on them. If a
stranger is seen approaching near the threshing-floor, the Kondhs keep
him off by signalling to him with their hands, without speaking. The
serrated sickle is not used, because it produces a sound like that of
cattle grazing, which would be unpropitious. If cattle were used in
threshing the crop, it is believed that the earth god would feel
insulted by the dung and urine of the animals.
They believe that they can transform themselves into tigers or
snakes, half the soul leaving the body and becoming changed into one of
these animals, either to kill an enemy, or satisfy hunger by having a
good feed on cattle in the jungle. During this period, they are
believed to feel dull and listless, and disinclined for work, and, if a
tiger is killed in the forest, they will die synchronously. Mr. Fawcett
informs me that the Kondhs believe that the soul wanders during sleep.
On one occasion, a dispute arose owing to a man discovering that
another Kondh, whose spirit used to wander about in the guise of a
tiger, ate up his spirit, and he became ill.
When cholera breaks out in a village, all males and females smear
their bodies from head to foot with pig&rsquo;s fat liquefied by heat,
and continue to do so until a few days after the disappearance of the
dread disease. During this time, they do not bathe, lest the smell of
the fat should be washed away.&rdquo;

The Kondhs are said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5779src" href=
"#xd21e5779" name="xd21e5779src">177 to prevent the approach of the
goddess of small-pox by barricading the paths with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406]thorns and ditches, and boiling caldrons of
stinking oil. The leopard is looked upon in some way as a sacred beast
by the Kondhs of the northern M&#257;liahs. They object to a dead
leopard being carried through their villages, and oaths are taken on a
leopard&rsquo;s skin.
Referring to elf stones, or stones of the dead in European
countries, to which needles, buttons, milk, eggs, etc., are offered,
Mr. F. Fawcett describes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5787src" href=
"#xd21e5787" name="xd21e5787src">178 a Kondh ceremony, in which the
ground under a tree was cleared in the form of a square, within which
were circles of saffron (turmeric), charcoal, rice, and some yellow
powder, as well as an egg or a small chicken. A certain Kondh had fever
caused by an evil spirit, and the ceremony was an invitation to it to
come out, and go to another village.
The following account of a cow-shed sacrifice is given by Mr.
Fawcett.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5792src" href="#xd21e5792" name=
"xd21e5792src">179 &ldquo;A special liquor is brewed from grain for
the ceremony, on the first day of which there is a general fast, a pig
is bought by general subscription, and dragged to the place where it is
to be sacrificed by a rope &lsquo;through its belly.&rsquo; The pig is
stoned to death, but, ere it dies, each Khond cuts off some of the hair
and a little piece of the ear, which are treasured. The meat is divided
among them, and cooked with rice. The priest goes from house to house,
and performs the ceremony of the cow-shed. The ropes of the cattle
(chiefly buffaloes) which are out grazing are tied to the central point
in the cow-shed, and the other ends are laid on the ground across the
shed. These ropes are the visible objects, to which sacrifice is made.
The head of a chicken is buried near the ends tied to the post, and
near it are ranged leaves, on which are placed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407]rice, flesh of the pig, and a bit of its ear. A
little in front of these is buried a rotten egg. The chicken, whose
head is buried, is boiled, and eaten by children who have not yet
donned a cloth. The Khond puts the rice, piece of the ear, and the hair
of the pig, under the roof. In the evening the cattle come home, and
are tied by the ropes used in the ceremony. Then the women break their
fast&mdash;they must eat then. Drinking and dancing occupy the
two following days, during which no manure is removed from the
cow-shed. On the third day, the Khonds come out with a lump of it in
the hand, and throw it in one place, forming a heap, on which the
priest pours liquor and rice.&rdquo;
The following example of a Kondh oath is given by Mr. J. A. R.
Stevenson. &ldquo;The subject of the circumstance is first repeated by
the swearing party, and a basket containing the following things is
held before him:&mdash;

A blood-sucker (lizard).
A bit of tiger&rsquo;s skin.
A peacock&rsquo;s feather.
Earth from a &lsquo;white-ant&rsquo; hill.
Rice mixed with fowl&rsquo;s blood.
A lighted lamp.

He proceeds with his oath, touching each object in the basket at
that part of the oath which refers to that object. &lsquo;Oh! father
(god), I swear, and, if I swear falsely, then, Oh! father, may I become
shrivelled and dry like a blood-sucker, and thus die. May I be killed
by a tiger. May I crumble to dust like this white-ant&rsquo;s hill. May
I be blown about like this feather. May I be extinguished like this
lamp.&rsquo; In saying the last words, he puts a few grains of rice in
his mouth, and blows out the lamp, and the basket with its contents is
made to touch the top of his head.&rdquo; [<a id=
"pb408" href="#pb408" name="pb408">408]
In 1904, a case illustrating the prevailing belief in witchcraft
occurred in the Vizagapatam hill tracts. The youngest of three brothers
died of fever, and, when the body was cremated, the fire failed to
consume the upper portion. The brothers concluded that death must have
been caused by the witchcraft of a certain Kondh. They accordingly
attacked him, and killed him. After death, the brothers cut the body in
half, and dragged the upper half to their own village, where they
attempted to nail it up on the spot where their deceased
brother&rsquo;s body failed to burn. The accused were arrested on the
spot, with the fragment of the Kondh&rsquo;s corpse. They were
sentenced to death, and the sentence was confirmed by the High
Court.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5822src" href="#xd21e5822" name=

In 1906, a Kondh, suspecting a P&#257;no girl of having stolen some
cloths and a silver ornament from him, went to the dhengada house in
Sollagodo, where the girl slept with other unmarried girls, and took
her to his village, where he confined her in his house. On the
following day, he took her to an Oriya trader, who thrashed her, in
order to make her confess to the theft. Subsequently, some of the
villagers collected to see her undergo the ordeal of boiling water. A
pot nearly full of water was boiled, some cow-dung and sacred rice
added, and a rupee placed in the pot. The girl was ordered to take out
the rupee. This she did three times, but, on the fourth occasion, the
water scalded her hand and forearm. She was then ordered to pay as a
fine her ear-ring, which was worth one rupee. This she did, as it was
the custom for an unsuccessful person to hand over some property. Her
right hand was practically destroyed as the result of the scalding. An
elderly P&#257;tro (headman) [<a id="pb409" href=
"#pb409" name="pb409">409]deposed that the ordinary practice
in trials of this sort is to place two pots of water, one boiling and
the other cold. In the boiling water a rupee and some rice are placed,
and the suspected person has to take out the rupee once, and should
then dip his hand in the cold water. If the hand is then scalded, the
person is considered guilty, and has to pay a fine to the caste.
In trial by immersion in water, the disputants dive into a pool, and
he who can keep under water the longest is considered to be in the
right. On one occasion, some years ago, when two villages were
disputing the right of possession of a certain piece of land, the
Magistrate resorted to a novel method to settle the dispute. He
instituted a tug-of-water between an equal number of representatives of
the contending parties. The side which won took possession of the
disputed property, to the satisfaction of all.<a class="noteref" id=

In connection with sacred rice, which has been referred to above,
reference may be made to the custom of Mahapras&#257;d Songatho.
&ldquo;It is prevalent among the Khonds and other hill tribes of Ganjam
and Orissa, and is found among the Oriyas. Sangatho means union or
friendship. Mahapras&#257;d Songatho is friendship sworn by
mahapras&#257;d, i.e., cooked rice consecrated to god Jagannath
of Puri. The remains of the offering are dried and preserved. All
pilgrims visiting Puri invariably get a quantity of this
mahapras&#257;d, and freely distribute it to those who ask for it. It
is regarded as a sacred thing, endowed with supreme powers of forgiving
the sins and wrongs of men by mere touch. It is not only holy itself,
but also sanctifies everything done in its presence. It is believed
that one dare not [<a id="pb410" href="#pb410"
name="pb410">410]commit a foul deed, utter a falsehood, or
even entertain an evil thought, when it is held in the hands. On
account of such beliefs, witnesses in law suits (especially Oriyas) are
asked to swear by it when giving evidence. Mahapras&#257;d Songatho is
sworn friendship between two individuals of the same sex. Instances are
on record of friendship contracted between a wealthy and cultured
townsman and a poor village rustic, or between a Br&#257;hmin woman of
high family and a S&#363;dra servant. Songatho is solemnised with some
ceremonies. On an auspicious day fixed for the purpose, the parties to
the Songatho, with their relatives, friends and well-wishers, go to a
temple in procession to the festive music of flutes and drum. There, in
that consecrated place, the would-be friends take a solemn oath, with
the god before them, mahapras&#257;d in their hands, and the assemblage
to witness that they will be lifelong friends, in spite of any changes
that might come over them or their families. The ceremony closing,
there will be dinners, gifts and presents on both sides, and the day is
all mirth and merriment. Thus bound by inseparable ties of friendship,
they live to the end of their lives on terms of extreme intimacy and
affection. They seize every opportunity of meeting, and living in each
other&rsquo;s company. They allow no festival to pass without an
exchange of new cloths, and other valuable presents. No important
ceremony is gone through in any one&rsquo;s house without the other
being invited. Throughout the year, they will send each other the
various fruits and vegetables in their respective seasons. If one dies,
his or her family does not consider the bond as having been snapped,
but continues to look upon the other more or less in the same manner as
did the deceased. The survivor, if in need of help, is sure to receive
[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411]assistance and sympathy from the family of the
deceased friend. This is how the institution is maintained by the less
civilised Oriyas of the rural parts. The romance of the Songatho
increases with the barbarity of the tribe. The Khonds, and other hill
tribes, furnish us with an example of Songatho, which retains all its
primitive simplicity. Among them, Songatho is ideal friendship, and
examples of Damon and Pythias are not rare. A Khond has been known to
ruin himself for the sake of his friend. He willingly sacrifices all
that he has, and even his life, to protect the interests of his friend.
The friends have nothing but affection for each other.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e5843src" href="#xd21e5843" name=
"xd21e5843src">182
It is noted, in the Gazetteer of the Vizagapatam district, that
&ldquo;the Khonds steal cattle, especially those belonging to
Brinj&#257;ri gangs, in an open manner, for the sake of their flesh. In
1898, at Veppiguda near Gud&#257;ri a party of them attacked four
constables who were patrolling the country to check these thefts,
thrashed them, and carried off all their property and uniforms. Efforts
to arrest these men resulted in the inhabitants of their village
fleeing to the hills, and, for a time, it looked as if there was danger
of others joining them, and of the Khonds going out. In 1882, the
Khonds of K&#257;lahandi State rose against the Uriyas, and murdered
some hundreds of them. Luckily the invitation to join them, conveyed by
the circulation of the head, fingers, hair, etc., of an early victim,
was not accepted by the Khonds of this district.&rdquo; The news of the
rising was conveyed to Mr. H. G. Prendergast, Assistant Superintendent
of Police, by a Domb disguised as a fakir, who carried the report
concealed in his languti (cloth). He [<a id=
"pb412" href="#pb412" name="pb412">412]was rewarded with a
silver bangle. At a meeting held at the village of Balwarpur, it was
decided that the Kultas should all be killed and swept out of the
country. As a sign of this, the Kondhs carried brooms about. At
Asurgarh the police found four headless corpses, and learnt from the
widows all that they had to say about the atrocities. The murders had
been committed in the most brutal way. All the victims were scalped
while still alive, and one had an arm and a leg cut off before being
scalped. As each victim died, his death was announced by three taps on
a drum given slowly, followed by shouting and dancing. The unfortunate
men were dragged out of their houses, and killed before their women and
children. Neither here nor anywhere else were the women outraged,
though they were threatened with death to make them give up buried
treasure. One woman was in this way made to dig up a thousand rupees.
On a tamarind tree near the village of Billat, affixed to it as a
trophy, there was the scalped head of a Kulta, hacked about in the most
horrible way.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e5850src" href="#xd21e5850"
name="xd21e5850src">183
The fact is noted by Mr. Jayaram Moodaliar that the Kondh system of
notation is duodecimal. Thirteen is twelve and one, forty three twelves
and four, and so forth.

Kondra.&mdash;The Kondras or Kondoras are a fishing caste in
Ganjam, who fish in ponds, lakes, rivers, and backwaters, but are never
engaged in sea-fishing. It has been suggested that the name is derived
from konkoda, a crab, as they catch crabs in the Chilka lake, and sell
them. The Kondras rank very low in the social scale, and even the
Haddis refuse to beat drums for them, and will not accept partially
boiled rice, which they have touched. In some places, the members of
the caste call themselves D&#257;sa D&#299;varo, and claim descent from
the boatmen who rowed the boat when King Bharatha went to Chithrakutam,
to inform R&#257;ma of the death of Dasaratha. Apparently the caste is
divided into two endogamous sections, viz., Macha Kondras, who follow
the traditional occupation of fishing, and Dand&#257;si Khondras, who
have taken to the duties of village watchmen. As examples of septs or
bamsams, the following may be cited:&mdash;k&#257;ko (crow), bilva
(jackal), gaya (cow), kukkiriya (dogs), gh&#257;sia (grass), bholia
(wild dog), sanguna (vulture). A few said that reverence is paid to the
animals after which the bamsam is named before the marriage ceremonies,
but this was denied by others. The headman of the caste is styled
B&#275;hara, and he is assisted by the Dolob&#275;hara and Bhollobaya.
There is also a caste [<a id="pb416" href=
"#pb416" name="pb416">416]messenger called Chattia. The
B&#275;hara receives a fee of a rupee on occasions of marriage, and one
anna for death ceremonies.
Girls are married either before or after puberty. Sometimes a girl
is married in performance of a vow to the sahada (Streblus
asper) tree. The ground round the tree is cleaned, a new cloth is
then tied round the trunk, and a bow and arrow are rested against it.
The B&#275;hara officiates as priest, and on behalf of the girl, places
near the tree twelve handfuls or measures of rice and twelve of
d&#257;l (peas: Cajanus indicus), and twelve pieces of string on
a leaf, as provisions for the bridegroom. If the girl has not reached
maturity, she must remain seven days near the tree; otherwise she
remains four days. On the last day, the B&#275;hara, sitting close to
the tree, says: &ldquo;We have given you provisions for twelve years.
Give us a tsado-patra (deed of separation).&rdquo; This is written on a
palmyra leaf, and thrown down near the tree.
The dead are cremated, and the corpses of both men and women are
said to be placed face downwards on the pyre. Among many other castes,
only those of women are placed in this position. The death ceremonies
are similar to those observed by many Oriya castes. A bit of bone is
removed from the burning-ground, and food offered to it daily until the
tenth day, when all the agnates, as well as the brothers-in-law and
sons-in-law of the deceased, are shaved. The sons of the sister of the
dead person are also expected to be shaved if they are fatherless; but,
if their father is alive, they are shaved on the following day.
The Kondras regard Ganga-d&#275;vi as their caste deity, but worship
also other deities, e.g., Ch&#257;munda, Buddhi, and
K&#257;lika. [<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name=

Konga.&mdash;Konga or Kongu is a territorial term, meaning
inhabitant of the Kongu country. It has, at recent times of census,
been returned as a division of a large number of classes, mostly Tamil,
which include Ambattan, Kaik&#333;lan, Kamm&#257;lan, K&#363;ravan,
Kusavan, Malayan, Odd&#275;, Pallan, Paraiyan, Sh&#257;n&#257;n,
Uppara, and Vell&#257;la. It is used as a term of abuse among the
Badagas of the N&#299;lgiri hills. Those, for example, who made
mistakes in matching Holmgren&rsquo;s wools, were scornfully called
Konga by the onlookers. Similarly, in parts of the Tamil country, a
tall, lean and stupid individual is called a Kongan.
Konga Vell&#257;la.&mdash;For the following note on the Konga
Vell&#257;las of the Trichinopoly district, I am indebted to Mr. F. R.
Hemingway. They seem to have little in common with the other
Vell&#257;las, except their name, and appear to hold a lower position
in society, for Reddis will not eat with them, and they will dine with
Tottiyans and others of the lower non-Br&#257;hman castes. They live in
compact communities, generally in hamlets. Their dwellings are
generally thatched huts, containing only one room. They are
cultivators, but not well off. Their men can generally be recognized by
the number of large gold rings which they wear in the lobes of the
ears, and the pendant (murugu), which hangs from the upper part of the
ears. Their women have a characteristic t&#257;li (marriage badge) of
large size, strung on to a number of cotton threads, which are not, as
among other castes, twisted together. They also seem always to wear an
ornament called t&#257;yittu, rather like the common cylindrical
talisman, on the left arm.
The Konga Vell&#257;las are split into two endogamous divisions,
viz., the Konga Vell&#257;las proper, and the Tondan or
Ilakanban-k&#363;ttam (servant or inferior sub-division). <span class=
"pagenum">[418]The
latter are admittedly the offspring of illegitimate intercourse with
outsiders by girls and widows of the caste, who have been expelled in
consequence of their breach of caste rules.
The Kongas proper have an elaborate caste organisation. Their
country is divided into twenty-four n&#257;dus, each comprising a
certain number of villages, and possessing recognised head-quarters,
which are arranged into four groups under the villages of
Palayak&#333;ttai, K&#257;ngayam, Pud&#363;r and Kaday&#363;r, all in
the Coimbatore district. Each village is under a Kottukk&#257;ran, each
n&#257;du under a N&#257;ttu-kavundan or Periyatanakk&#257;ran, and
each group under a Pattakk&#257;ran. The last is treated with
considerable respect. He wears gold toe-rings, is not allowed to see a
corpse, and is always saluted with clasped hands. He is only
occasionally called in to settle caste disputes, small matters being
settled by the Kottukk&#257;rans, and matrimonial questions by the
N&#257;ttukavundan. Both the Kongas proper, and the Tondans have a
large number of exogamous septs, the names of which generally denote
some article, the use of which is taboo, e.g., k&#257;dai
(quail), pannai (Celosia argentea, a pot-herb). The most
desirable match for a boy is his maternal uncle&rsquo;s daughter. To
such an extent is the preference for such unions carried out, that a
young boy is often married to a grown-up woman, and it is admitted
that, in such cases, the boy&rsquo;s father takes upon himself the
duties of a husband until his son has reached maturity, and that the
wife is allowed to consort with any one belonging to the caste whom she
may fancy, provided that she continues to live in her husband&rsquo;s
house. With widows, who are not allowed to remarry, the rules are more
strict. A man convicted of undue intimacy with a widow is expelled from
the caste, unless [<a id="pb419" href="#pb419"
name="pb419">419]she consents to his leaving her and going
back to the caste, and he provides her with adequate means to live
separately. The form of consent is for the woman to say that she is
only a mud vessel, and has been broken because polluted, whereas the
man is of bell-metal, and cannot be utterly polluted. The erring man is
readmitted to the caste by being taken to the village common, where he
is beaten with an erukkan (arka: Calotropis gigantea) stick, and
by providing a black sheep for a feast to his relatives.
At weddings and funerals, the Konga Vell&#257;las employ priests of
their own caste, called Arumaikk&#257;rans and Arumaikk&#257;ris. These
must be married people, who have had children. The first stage, so far
as a wife is concerned, is to become an elutingalk&#257;ri (woman of
seven Mondays), without which she cannot wear a red mark on her
forehead, or get any of her children married. This is effected, after
the birth of at least one child, by observing a ceremonial at her
father&rsquo;s house. A pandal (booth) of green leaves is erected in
the house, and a fillet of pungam (Pongamia glabra) and tamarind
twigs is placed round her head. She is then presented with a new cloth,
prepares some food and eats it, and steps over a mortar. A married
couple wait until one of their children is married, and then undergo
the ceremony called arumaimanam at the hands of ten Arumaikk&#257;rans
and some Pulavans (bards among the Kaik&#333;lans), who touch the pair
with some green grass dipped in sandal and water, oil, etc. The man
then becomes an Arumaikk&#257;ran, and his wife an Arumaikk&#257;ri.
All people of arumai rank are treated with great respect, and, when one
of them dies, a drum is beaten by a man standing on another man&rsquo;s
shoulders, who receives as a present seven measures of grain measured,
and an equal quantity unmeasured. [<a id="pb420"
href="#pb420" name="pb420">420]
The betrothal ceremony takes place at the house of the future bride,
in the presence of both the maternal uncles, and consists in tying
fruit and betel leaf in the girl&rsquo;s cloth. On the wedding day, the
bridegroom is shaved, and an Arumaikk&#257;ri pours water over him. If
he has a sister, the ceremony of betrothing his prospective daughter to
her son, is performed. He then goes on horseback, carrying some fruit
and a pestle, to a stone planted for the occasion, and called the
n&#257;ttukal, which he worships. The stone is supposed to represent
the Kongu king, and the pestle the villagers, and the whole ceremony is
said to be a relic of a custom of the ancient Kongu people, to which
the caste formerly belonged, which required them to obtain the sanction
of the king for every marriage. On his return from the n&#257;ttukal,
balls of white and coloured rice are taken round the bridegroom, to
ward off the evil eye. His mother then gives him three mouthfuls of
food, and eats the remainder herself, to indicate that henceforth she
will not provide him with meals. A barber then blesses him, and he
repairs on horseback to the bride&rsquo;s house, where he is received
by one of her party similarly mounted. His ear-rings are put in the
bride&rsquo;s ears, and the pair are carried on the shoulders of their
maternal uncles to the n&#257;ttukal. On their return thence, they are
touched by an Arumaikk&#257;ran with a betel leaf dipped in oil, milk
and water. The t&#257;li (marriage badge) is worshipped and blessed,
and the Arumaikk&#257;ran ties it on her neck. The barber then
pronounces an elaborate blessing, which runs as follows: &ldquo;Live as
long as the sun and moon may endure, or Pasupatisvarar (Siva) at
Kar&#363;r. May your branches spread like the banyan tree, and your
roots like grass, and may you flourish like the bamboo. May ye twain be
like the flower and the thread, which [<a id=
"pb421" href="#pb421" name="pb421">421]together form the
garland and cleave together, like water and the reed growing in
it.&rdquo; If a Pulavan is present, he adds a further blessing, and the
little fingers of the contracting couple are linked together, anointed
with milk, and then separated.
The death ceremonies are not peculiar, except that the torch for the
pyre is carried by a Paraiyan, and not, as among most castes, by the
chief mourner, and that no ceremonies are performed after the third
day. The custom is to collect the bones on that day and throw them into
water. The barber then pours a mixture of milk and ghi (clarified
butter) over a green tree, crying poli, poli.
The caste has its own beggars, called Mudav&#257;ndi

Konkani.&mdash;Defined, in the Madras Census Report, 1901, as
a territorial or linguistic term, meaning a dweller in the Konkan
country (Canara), or a person speaking the Konkani dialect of
Mar&#257;thi. Kadu Konkani (bastard Konkani) is a name opposed to the
G&#333;d or pure Konkanis. In South Canara, &ldquo;the Konkani
Br&#257;hmans are the trading and shop-keeping class, and, in the most
out-of-the-way spots, the Konkani village shop is to be
found.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6007src" href="#xd21e6007"

The following note on Konkanis is extracted from the Travancore
Census Report, 1901. &ldquo;The Konkanis include the Br&#257;hman,
Kshatriya, and Vaisya castes of the S&#257;rasvata section of the Gauda
Br&#257;hmans. The Br&#257;hmans of this community differ, however,
from the Konkanastha Mah&#257;r&#257;shtra Br&#257;hmans belonging to
the [<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422]Dr&#257;vida group. The Konkani S&#363;dras who
have settled on this coast are known by a different name, Kudumikkar.
The Konkanis&rsquo; original habitation is the bank of the
S&#257;rasvati, a river well known in early Sanskrit works, but said to
have lost itself in the sands of the deserts north of Rajputana.
According to the Sahy&#257;drikanda, a branch of these S&#257;rasvatas
lived in Tirhut in Bengal, whence ten families were brought over by
Parasur&#257;ma to G&#333;mantaka, the modern Goa, Panchakr&#333;si,
and Kusasthali. Attracted by the richness and beauty of the new
country, others followed, and the whole population settled themselves
in sixty villages and ninety-six hamlets in and around Goa, the
settlers in the former being called Shashtis (Sanskrit for sixty), and
those in the latter being called Shannavis or Shenavis (Sanskrit for
ninety-six). The history of those S&#257;rasvatas was one of
uninterrupted general and commercial prosperity until about twenty
years after the advent of the Portuguese. When King Emanuel died and
King John succeeded him, the policy of the Goanese Government is
believed to have changed in favour of religious persecution. A large
efflux to the Canarese and Tulu countries was the result. Thence the
Konkanis appear to have migrated to Travancore and Cochin, and found a
safe haven under the rule of their Hindu sovereigns. In their last
homes, the Konkanis extended and developed their commerce, built
temples, and endowed them so magnificently that the religious
institutions of that community, especially at Cochin and Alleppey,
continue to this day almost the richest in all Malabar.
&ldquo;Canter Visscher writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6016src"

also because from the shops of these people in town we obtain all our

various kinds of linen, and some again are money-changers, so that
there is hardly one who is not engaged in trade.&rsquo; The occupation
of the Konkanis has been commerce ever since the advent of the
Portuguese in India. Some of them make p&#257;patams<a class="noteref"

(popadams) which is a condiment of almost universal consumption in
Malabar. Till recently, the Konkanis in Travancore knew nothing else
than trade. But now, following the example of their kinsmen in Bombay
and South Canara, they are gradually taking to other professions.
&ldquo;Having settled themselves in the Canarese districts, most of
the Konkanis came under the influence of Madhav&#257;ch&#257;rya,
unlike the Shenavis, who still continue to be Smartas. The worship of
Venkatar&#257;mana, the presiding deity of the Tirupati shrine, is held
in great importance. Every Konkani temple is called Tirumala
D&#275;vasmam, as the divinity that resides on the sacred hill
(Tirumala) is represented in each.&rdquo;
Kons&#257;ri.&mdash;The Kons&#257;ris derive their name from
konsa, a bell-metal dish. They are Oriya workers in bell-metal, and
manufacture dishes, cups and plates. Br&#257;hmans are employed by them
as pur&#333;hits (priests) and gurus (preceptors). They eat fish and
mutton, but [<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=

Koraga.&mdash;The Koragas are summed up, in the Madras Census
Report, 1901, as being a wild tribe of basket-makers and labourers,
chiefly found in Mudbidri, and in Putt&#363;r in the Uppinangadi
t&#257;luk of South Canara. They are, Mr. M. T. Walhouse
writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6055src" href="#xd21e6055" name=
"xd21e6055src">187 &ldquo;a very quiet and inoffensive race; small
and slight, the men seldom exceeding five feet six inches;
black-skinned, like most Indian aborigines, thick-lipped, noses broad
and flat, and hair rough and bushy. Their principal occupation is
basket-making, and they must labour for their masters. They live on the
outskirts of villages, and may not dwell in houses of clay or mud, but
in huts of leaves, called koppus. Like many of the wild tribes of
India, they are distinguished by unswerving truthfulness. The word of a
Koragar is proverbial.&rdquo;
The Koragas rank below the Holeyas. In some towns, they are employed
by the sanitary department as scavengers. They remove the hide, horns,
and bones of cattle and buffaloes, which die in the villages, and sell
them mainly to M&#257;ppilla merchants. They accept food, which is left
over after feasts held by various castes. [<a id=
"pb425" href="#pb425" name="pb425">425]Some are skilful in
the manufacture of cradles, baskets, cylinders to hold paddy, winnowing
and sowing baskets, scale-pans, boxes, rice-water strainers,
ring-stands for supporting pots, coir (cocoanut fibre) rope, brushes
for washing cattle, etc. They also manufacture various domestic
utensils from soapstone, which they sell at a very cheap rate to
shopkeepers in the bazar.
&ldquo;Numerous slave-castes,&rdquo; Mr. Walhouse continues,
&ldquo;exist throughout India, not of course recognised by
law&mdash;indeed formally emancipated by an Act of Government in
1843&mdash;but still, though improved in condition, virtually slaves.
Their origin and status are thus described. After the four principal
classes, who sprang from Brahma, came six Anuloma castes, which arose
from the intercourse of Brahmans and Kshatriyas with women of the
classes below them respectively. The term Anuloma denotes straight and
regular hair, which in India characterises the Aryan stock. After these
came six Pratiloma castes, originating in reverse order from Brahman
and Kshatriya women by fathers of the inferior classes. The third among
these was the Chand&#257;la, the offspring of Shudra fathers by Brahman
women. The Chand&#257;las, or slaves, were sub-divided into fifteen
classes, none of which might intermarry, a rule still strictly
observed. The two last, and lowest of the fifteen classes, are the
Kapata or rag-wearing, and the Soppu or leaf-wearing Koragas. Such is
the account given by Brahman chroniclers; but the probability is that
these lowest slave-castes are the descendants of that primitive
population which the Aryan invaders from the north found occupying the
soil, and, after a struggle of ages, gradually dispossessed, driving
some to the hills and jungles, and reducing others to the condition of
slaves. All these races are regarded by their Hindu <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href="#pb426" name=
"pb426">426]masters with boundless contempt, and held
unspeakably unclean. This feeling seems the result and witness of times
when the despised races were powerful, and to be approached as lords by
their now haughty masters, and was probably intensified by struggles
and uprisings, and the memory of humiliations inflicted on the
ultimately successful conquerors. Evidences for this may be inferred
from many curious rights and privileges, which the despised castes
possess and tenaciously retain. Moreover, the contempt and loathing in
which they are ordinarily held are curiously tinctured with
superstitious fear, for they are believed to possess secret powers of
magic and witchcraft, and influence with the old malignant deities of
the soil, who can direct good or evil fortune. As an instance, if a
Brahman mother&rsquo;s children die off when young, she calls a Koragar
woman, gives her some oil, rice, and copper money, and places the
surviving child in her arms. The out-caste woman, who may not at other
times be touched, gives the child suck, puts on it her iron bracelets,
and, if a boy, names it Koragar, if a girl, Kor&#257;pulu. She then
returns it to the mother. This is believed to give a new lease of life.
Again, when a man is dangerously ill, or perhaps unfortunate, he pours
oil into an earthen vessel, worships it in the same way as the family
god, looks at his face reflected in the oil, and puts into it a hair
from his head and a nail paring from his toe. The oil is then presented
to the Koragars, and the hostile gods or stars are believed to be
propitiated.&rdquo; According to Mr. Ullal Raghvendra Rao,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6067src" href="#xd21e6067" name=
"xd21e6067src">188 old superstitious Hindus never venture to utter
the word Koraga during the night. [<a id="pb427"

It is noted in the Manual of the South Canara district, that
&ldquo;all traditions unite in attributing the introduction of the Tulu
Brahmins of the present day to May&#363;r Varma (of the Kadamba
dynasty), but they vary in details connected with the manner in which
they obtained a firm footing in the land. One account says that
Hab&#257;shika, chief of the Koragas, drove out May&#363;r Varma, but
was in turn expelled by May&#363;r Varma&rsquo;s son, or son-in-law,
L&#333;k&#257;ditya of G&#333;karnam, who brought Brahmins from
Ahi-ksh&#275;tra, and settled them in thirty-two villages.&rdquo;
Concerning the power, and eventual degradation of the Koragas, the
following version of the tradition is cited by Mr. Walhouse.
&ldquo;When Lokadir&#257;ya, whose date is fixed by Wilks about 1450
B.C., was king of Bhanvarshe in North Canara (a place noted by
Ptolemy), an invader, by name Hab&#257;shika, brought an army from
above the ghauts, consisting of all the present Chand&#257;la or
slave-castes, overwhelmed that part of the country, and marched
southward to Mangalore, the present capital of South Canara. The
invading host was scourged with small-pox, and greatly annoyed by ants,
so Hab&#257;shika moved on to Manjeshwar, a place of ancient repute,
twelve miles to the south, subdued the local ruler Angarawarma, son of
Virawarma, and reigned there in conjunction with his nephew; but after
twelve years both died&mdash;one legend says through enchantments
devised by Angarawarma; another that a neighbouring ruler treacherously
proposed a marriage between his sister and Hab&#257;shika, and, on the
bridegroom and his caste-men attending for the nuptials, a wholesale
massacre of them all was effected. Angarawarma, then returning, drove
the invading army into the jungles, where they were reduced to such
extremity that they consented to become slaves, and were apportioned
amongst the Brahmans and original [<a id="pb428"
href="#pb428" name="pb428">428]landholders. Some were, set
to watch the crops and cattle, some to cultivate, others to various
drudgeries, which are still allotted to the existing slave-castes, but
the Koragars, who had been raised by Hab&#257;shika to the highest
posts under his government, were stripped and driven towards the
sea-shore, there to be hanged, but, being ashamed of their naked
condition, they gathered the leaves of the nicki bush (Vitex
Negundo), which grows abundantly in waste places, and made small
coverings for themselves in front. On this the executioners took pity
on them and let them go, but condemned them to be the lowest of the
low, and wear no other covering but leaves. The Koragas are now the
lowest of the slave divisions, and regarded with such intense loathing
and hatred that up to quite recent times one section of them, called
And&#275; or pot Koragars, continually wore a pot suspended from their
necks, into which they were compelled to spit, being so utterly unclean
as to be prohibited from even spitting on the highway; and to this day
their women continue to show in their leafy aprons a memorial of the
abject degradation to which their whole race was doomed.&rdquo; It is
said that in pre-British days an And&#275; Koraga had to take out a
licence to come into the towns and villages by day. At night mere
approach thereto was forbidden, as his presence would cause terrible
calamity. The Koragas of those days could cook their food only in
broken vessels. The name Vastra, by which one class of Koragas is
called, has reference to their wearing vastra, or clothes, such as were
used to shroud a dead body, and given to them in the shape of charity,
the use of a new cloth being prohibited. According to another account
the three divisions of the Koragas are (1) Kappada, those who wear
clothes, (2) Tippi, who wear ornaments made <span class=
"pagenum">[429]of
the cocoanut shell, and (3) Vanti, who wear a peculiar kind of large
ear-ring. These three clans may eat together, but not intermarry. Each
clan is divided into exogamous septs called balis, and it may be noted
that some of the Koraga balis, such as Haledennaya and
Kum&#275;rdennaya, are also found among the M&#257;ri and Mundala
Holeyas.

Koraga.

On the subject of Koraga dress, Mr. Ullal Raghvendra Rao informs us
that &ldquo;while the males gird a piece of cloth round their loins,
the females cover their waist with leaves of the forest woven together.
Various reasons are assigned for this custom. According to a tradition,
at the time when the Koragars had reigned, now far distant, one of
these &lsquo;blacklegged&rsquo; (this is usually the expression by
which they are referred to during the night) demanded a girl of high
birth in marriage. Being enraged at this, the upper class withheld,
after the overthrow of the Koragas, every kind of dress from Koraga
women, who, to protect themselves from disgrace, have since had
recourse to the leaves of the forest, conceiving in the meantime that
god had decreed this kind of covering.&rdquo; Mr. Walhouse
writes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6087src" href="#xd21e6087" name=
"xd21e6087src">189 further that the Koragas wear an &ldquo;apron of
twigs and leaves over the buttocks. Once this was the only covering
allowed them, and a mark of their deep degradation. But now, when no
longer compulsory, and of no use, as it is worn over the clothes, the
women still retain it, believing its disuse would be unlucky.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Koragas,&rdquo; Mr. H. A. Stuart tells us,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6090src" href="#xd21e6090" name="xd21e6090src">190
&ldquo;cover the lower part of their body with a black cloth and the
upper part with a white one, and their head-dress is a cap made of the
areca-nut spathe, like that worn by the Holeyas. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430]Their ornaments consist of brass ear-rings, an
iron bracelet, and beads of bone strung on a thread and tied around
their waist.&rdquo; The waist-belt of a Koraga, whom I saw at Udipi,
was made of owl bones.
&ldquo;It may,&rdquo; Mr. Walhouse states,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6097src" href="#xd21e6097" name="xd21e6097src">191 &ldquo;be
noted that, according to the traditional accounts, when the invading
hosts under Hab&#257;shika were in their turn overthrown and subjected,
they accepted slavery under certain conditions that preserved to them
some shadow of right. Whilst it was declared that they should be for
ever in a state of servitude, and be allowed a meal daily, but never
the means of providing for the next day&rsquo;s meal. Each slave was
ascripted to his master under the following forms, which have come down
to our days, and were observed in the purchase or transfer of slaves
within living memory. The slave having washed, anointed himself with
oil, and put on a new cloth, his future owner took a metal plate,
filled it with water, and dropped in a gold coin, which the slave
appropriated after drinking up the water. The slave then took some
earth from his future master&rsquo;s estate, and threw it on the spot
he chose for his hut, which was given over to him with all the trees
thereon. When land was transferred, the slaves went with it, and might
also be sold separately. Occasionally they were presented to a temple
for the service of the deity. This was done publicly by the master
approaching the temple, putting some earth from before its entrance
into the slave&rsquo;s mouth, and declaring that he abjured his rights,
and transferred them to the deity within. Rules were laid down, with
the Hindoo passion for regulating small matters, not only detailing
what work the slaves should do, but what allowances of food
[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431]they should receive, and what presents on
certain festival occasions they should obtain from, or make to the
master. On marriages among themselves, they prostrated themselves
before the master and obtained his consent, which was accompanied with
a small present of money and rice. The marriage over, they again came
before the master, who gave them betel nuts, and poured some oil on the
bride&rsquo;s head. On the master&rsquo;s death, his head slave
immediately shaved his hair and moustache. There was also a list of
offences for which masters might punish slaves, amongst which the
employment of witchcraft, or sending out evil spirits against others,
expressly figures; and the punishments with which each offence might be
visited are specified, the worst of which are branding and flogging
with switches. There was no power of life and death, and in cases of
withholding the usual allowance, or of punishments severer than
prescribed, slaves might complain to the authorities.&rdquo;
On the subject of Koraga slavery, Mr. Ullal Raghvendra Rao writes
that &ldquo;although these slaves are in a degraded condition, yet they
by no means appear to be dejected or unhappy. A male slave gets three
hanis of paddy (unhusked rice) or a hani and a half of rice daily,
besides a small quantity of salt. The female slave gets two hanis of
paddy, and, if they be man and wife, they can easily sell a portion of
the rice to procure other necessaries of life. They are also allowed
one cloth each every year, and, besides, when transferred from one
master to another, they get a cocoanut, a jack tree (Artocarpus
integrifolia), and a piece of land where they can sow ten or twenty
seers of rice. The greater number of slaves belong to the Alia
Sant&#257;nam castes (inheritance in the female line), and among these
people [<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name=
"pb432">432]a male slave is sold for three pagodas (fourteen
rupees) and a female slave for five pagoda; whereas the few slaves who
belong to the Makkala Sant&#257;nam castes (inheritance in the male
line) fetch five pagodas for the man slave, and three pagodas for the
female. This is because the children of the latter go to the
husband&rsquo;s master, while those of the former go to the
mother&rsquo;s master, who has the benefit of the husband&rsquo;s
services also. He has, however, to pay the expenses of their marriage,
which amount to a pagoda and a half; and, in like manner, the master of
the Makkala Sant&#257;na slave pays two pagodas for his marriage, and
gets possession of the female slave and her children. The master has
the power of hiring out his slave, for whose services he receives
annually about a mura of rice, or forty seers. They are also mortgaged
for three or four pagodas.&rdquo;
For the marriages of the Koragas, Mr. Walhouse informs us that
&ldquo;Sunday is an auspicious day, though Monday is for the other
slave castes. The bridegroom and bride, after bathing in cold water,
sit on a mat in the former&rsquo;s house, with a handful of rice placed
before them. An old man presides, takes a few grains of rice and
sprinkles on their heads, as do the others present, first the males and
then the females. The bridegroom then presents two silver coins to his
wife, and must afterwards give six feasts to the community.&rdquo; At
these feasts every Koraga is said to vie with his neighbour in eating
and drinking. &ldquo;Though amongst the other slave castes divorce is
allowed by consent of the community, often simply on grounds of
disagreement, and the women may marry again, with the Koragars marriage
is indissoluble, but a widow is entitled to re-marriage, and a man may
have a second, and even third wife, all living with him.&rdquo;
[<a id="pb433" href="#pb433" name=
"pb433">433]
Concerning the ceremonies observed on the birth of a child, Mr.
Ullal Raghvendra Rao writes that &ldquo;after a child is born, the
mother (as among Hindoos) is unholy, and cannot be touched or
approached. The inmates take leave of the koppu for five nights, and
depend on the hospitality of their friends, placing the mother under
the sole charge of a nurse or midwife. On the sixth night the master of
the koppu calls his neighbours, who can hardly refuse to oblige him
with their presence. The mother and the child are then given a tepid
bath, and this makes them holy. Members of each house bring with them a
seer of rice, half a seer of cocoanut oil, and a cocoanut. The woman
with the baby is seated on a mat&mdash;her neighbour&rsquo;s presents
before her in a flat basket. The oldest man present consults with his
comrades as to what name will best suit the child. A black string is
then tied round the waist of the baby. The rice, which comes in heaps
from the neighbours, is used for dinner on the occasion, and the
cocoanuts are split into two pieces, the lower half being given to the
mother of the child, and the upper half the owner. This is the custom
followed when the baby is a male one; in case of a female child, the
owner receives the upper half, leaving the lower half for the mother.
Koragars were originally worshippers of the sun, and they are still
called after the names of the days of the week&mdash;as Aita (a
corruption of Aditya, or the sun); Toma (S&#333;ma, or the moon);
Angara (Mangala); Gurva (Jupiter); Tanya (Shani, or Saturn); Tukra
(Shukra, or Venus). They have no separate temples for their God, but a
place beneath a k&#257;saracana tree (Strychnos
Nux-vomica) is consecrated for the worship of the deity which is
exclusively their own, and is called Kata. Worship in honour of this
deity is usually performed in the months of May, July, or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434]October. Two plantain leaves are placed on the
spot, with a heap of boiled rice mixed with turmeric. As is usual in
every ceremony observed by a Koragar, the senior in age takes the lead,
and prays to the deity to accept the offering and be satisfied. But now
they have, by following the example of Bants and Sudras, exchanged
their original object of worship for that of Bhutas
(demons).&rdquo;
On the subject of the religion of the Koragas, Mr. Walhouse states
that &ldquo;like all the slave castes and lower races, the Koragars
worship Mari Amma, the goddess presiding over small-pox, the most
dreadful form of Parvati, the wife of Siva. She is the most popular
deity in Canara, represented under the most frightful form, and
worshipped with bloody rites. Goats, buffaloes, pigs, fowls, etc., are
slaughtered at a single blow by an As&#257;di, one of the slave tribes
from above the ghauts. Although the Koragars, in common with all
slaves, are looked upon as excommunicated and unfit to approach any
Brahminical temple or deity, they have adopted the popular Hindoo
festivals of the Gokalastami or Krishna&rsquo;s birthday, and the
Chowti. In the latter, the preliminaries and prayers must be performed
by a virgin.&rdquo; Concerning these festivals, Mr. Ullal Raghvendra
Rao gives the following details. &ldquo;The Koragars have no fixed
feasts exclusively of their own, but for a long time they have been
observing those of the Hindus. Of these two are important. One is
G&#333;kula Ashtami, or the birthday of Krishna, and the other is the
Chowti or Pooliyar feast. The latter is of greater importance than the
former. The former is a holy day of abstinence and temperance, while
the latter is associated with feasting and merry-making, and looks more
like a gala-day set apart for anything but religious performance. On
the Ashtami some cakes of [<a id="pb435" href=
"#pb435" name="pb435">435]black gram are made in addition to
the usual dainties. The services of Bacchus are called in aid, and the
master of the koppu invites his relatives and friends. A regular
feasting commences, when the master takes the lead, and enjoys the
company of his guests by seating himself in their midst. They are made
to sit on the floor crosswise with a little space intervening between
every guest, who pays strict regard to all the rules of decency and
rank. To keep up the distinction of sexes, females are seated in an
opposite row. The host calls upon some of his intimates or friends to
serve on the occasion. The first dish is curry, the second rice; and
cakes and dainties come in next. The butler Koragar serves out to the
company the food for the banquet, while the guests eat it heartily. If
one of them lets so much as a grain of rice fall on his
neighbour&rsquo;s plate, the whole company ceases eating. The offender
is at once brought before the guests, and charged with having spoiled
the dinner. He is tried there and then, and sentenced to pay a fine
that will cover the expenses of another banquet. In case of resistance
to the authority of the tribunal, he is excommunicated and abandoned by
his wife, children and relatives. No one dare touch or speak to him. A
plea of poverty of course receives a kind consideration. The offender
is made to pay a small sum as a fine, which is paid for him by a
well-to-do Koragar. To crown the feast, a large quantity of toddy finds
its way into the midst of the company. A small piece of dry areca leaf
sewed together covers the head of a Koragar, and forms for him his hat.
This hat he uses as a cup, which contains a pretty large quantity of
liquid. A sufficient quantity is poured into their cup, and if, in
pouring, a drop finds its way to the ground, the butler is sure to
undergo the same penalty that attaches itself to any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436]irregularity in the dinner as described above.
After the banquet, some male members of the group join in a dance to
the pipe and drum, while others are stimulated by the intoxicating
drink into frisking and jumping about. To turn to the other festival.
The inmates of the house are required to fast the previous
night&mdash;one and all of them&mdash;and on the previous day flesh or
drink is not allowed. The next morning before sunrise, a virgin bathes,
and smears cowdung over a part of the house. The place having been
consecrated, a new basket, specially made for the occasion, is placed
on that spot. It contains a handful of beaten rice, two plantains, and
two pieces of sugar-cane. The basket is then said to contain the god of
the day, whom the sugar-cane represents, and the spot is too holy to be
approached by man or woman. A common belief which they hold, that the
prayers made by a virgin are duly responded to on account of her virgin
purity, does not admit of the worship being conducted by any one else.
The girl adorns the basket with flowers of the forest, and prays for
the choicest blessings on the inmates of the house all the year
round.
A Koraga woman, when found guilty of adultery, is said to be treated
in the following extraordinary way. If her paramour is of low caste
similar to herself, he has to marry her. But, in order to purify her
for the ceremony, he has to build a hut, and put the woman inside. It
is then set on fire, and the woman escapes as best she can to another
place where the same performance is gone through, and so on until she
has been burnt out seven times. She is then considered once more an
honest woman, and fit to be again married. According to Mr. Walhouse,
&ldquo;a row of seven small huts is built on a river-bank, set fire to,
and the offender made to run over the burning sticks and ashes as a
penance.&rdquo; A similar [<a id="pb437" href=
"#pb437" name="pb437">437]form of ordeal has been described
as occurring among the B&#257;kutas of South Canara by Mr. Stuart.
&ldquo;When a man is excommunicated, he must perform a ceremony called
y&#275;lu halli sudodu, which means burning seven villages, in order to
re-enter the caste. For this ceremony, seven small booths are built,
and bundles of grass are piled against them. The excommunicated man has
then to pass through these huts one after the other, and, as he does
so, the headman sets fire to the grass&rdquo; (cf. Koyi). It is
suggested by Mr. R. E. Enthoven that the idea seems to be &ldquo;a
rapid representation of seven existences, the outcast regaining his
status after seven generations have passed without further
transgression. The parallel suggested is the law of Manu that seven
generations are necessary to efface a lapse from the law of endogamous
marriage.&rdquo;
Of death ceremonies Mr. Walhouse tells us that &ldquo;on death the
bodies of all the slave castes used to be burnt, except in cases of
death from small-pox. This may have been to obviate the pollution of
the soil by their carcases when their degradation was deepest, but now,
and from long past, burial is universal. The master&rsquo;s permission
is still asked, and, after burial, four balls of cooked rice are placed
on the grave, possibly a trace of the ancient notion of supplying food
to the ghost of the deceased.&rdquo; A handful is said<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6135src" href="#xd21e6135" name=
"xd21e6135src">192 to be &ldquo;removed from the grave on the
sixteenth day after burial, and buried in a pit. A stone is erected
over it, on which some rice and toddy are placed as a last offering to
the departed soul which is then asked to join its ancestors.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It may,&rdquo; Mr. Walhouse writes, &ldquo;be noted that the
Koragars alone of all the slave or other castes eat the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438]flesh of alligators (crocodiles), and they share
with one or two other divisions of the slaves a curious scruple or
prejudice against carrying any four-legged animal, dead or alive. This
extends to anything with four legs, such as chairs, tables, cots, etc.,
which they cannot be prevailed upon to lift unless one leg be removed.
As they work as coolies, this sometimes produces inconvenience. A
somewhat similar scruple obtains among the Bygas of Central India,
whose women are not allowed to sit or lie on any four-legged bed or
stool.&rdquo; Like the Koragas, the B&#257;kudas of South Canara
&ldquo;will not carry a bedstead unless the legs are first taken off,
and it is said that this objection rests upon a supposed resemblance
between the four-legged cot and the four-legged ox.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6142src" href="#xd21e6142" name=
"xd21e6142src">193
Of the language spoken by the Koragars, Mr. Ullal Raghvendra Rao
states that &ldquo;it is a common belief that the Koragar has a
peculiar dialect generally spoken by him at his koppu. He may be
induced to give an account of his feasts, his gods, his family, but a
word about his dialect will frighten him out of his wits. Generally
polite and well-behaved, he becomes impolite and unmannerly when
questioned about his dialect.&rdquo; &ldquo;All the Hindoos,&rdquo; Mr.
Walhouse writes, &ldquo;believe that the Koragars have a language of
their own, understood only by themselves, but it seems doubtful whether
this is anything more than an idiom, or slang.&rdquo; A vocabulary of
the Koraga dialect is contained in the South Canara Manual (1895).
Korama.&mdash;See Korava.
Korava.&mdash;Members of this nomad tribe, which permeates
the length of the Indian peninsula, through countries where many
languages and dialects are spoken, are likely to be known by different
names in different [<a id="pb439" href="#pb439"
name="pb439">439]localities, and this is the case. They are
known as Korava from the extreme south to the north of the North Arcot
district, where they are called Koracha or Korcha, and in the Ceded
Districts they become Yerukala or Yerakala. In Calcutta they have been
traced practising as quack doctors, and assuming Mar&#257;tha names, or
adding terminations to their own, which suggest that they belong to a
caste in the south higher in the social scale than they really do. Some
Koravas pass for Vell&#257;las, calling themselves Agambadiar
Vell&#257;las with the title Pillai. Others call themselves Palli,
Kavarai, Idaiyan, Reddi, etc.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6160src" href=
"#xd21e6160" name="xd21e6160src">194 As railways spread over the
country, they readily adapted themselves to travelling by them, and the
opportunities afforded for going quickly far from the scene of a
recently committed crime, or for stealing from sleeping passengers,
were soon availed of. In 1899, the Superintendent of Government
Railways reported that &ldquo;the large organization of thieves,
commonly called Kepmari Koravas (though they never call themselves so),
use the railway to travel far. Some of them are now settled at Cuttack,
where they have set up as native doctors, whose speciality is curing
piles. Some are at Midnap&#363;r, and are going on to Calcutta, and
there were some at Puri some time ago. It is said that a gang of them
has gone recently to Tinnevelly, and taken up their abode near
Sermad&#275;vi, calling themselves Servaikars. One morning, in
Tinnevelly, while the butler in a missionary&rsquo;s house was
attending to his duties, an individual turned up with a fine fowl for
sale. The butler, finding that he could purchase it for about half the
real price, bought it, and showed it to his wife with no small pride in
his ability in [<a id="pb440" href="#pb440" name=
"pb440">440]making a bargain. But he was distinctly
crestfallen when his wife pointed out that it was his own bird, which
had been lost on the previous night. The seller was a
Korava.&rdquo;
In 1903, a gang of Koravas, travelling in the guise of
p&#363;j&#257;ris, was arrested at Puri. The Police discovered that a
warrant remained unexecuted against one of them, who had been concerned
in a dacoity case in North Arcot many years previously. The report of
the case states that &ldquo;cognate with the Kepmaries is a class of
Korava p&#363;j&#257;ris (as they call themselves in their own
village), who, emanating from one small hamlet in the Tanjore district,
are spread more or less all over India. There are, or were until the
other day, and probably are still some of them in Cuttack, Balasore,
Midnap&#363;r, Ahmedabad, Patna, Bombay, Secunderabad, and other
places. One of them attained a high position in Bombay. Their
ostensible profession is that of curing piles and fistulas, but it is
noticeable that, sooner or later after their taking up their abode at
any place, the Kepmaries are to be found somewhere near, and the
impression, which is not quite a certainty but very nearly so, is that
they play the convenient r&ocirc;le of receivers of property stolen by
the Kepmaries.&rdquo; K&#275;pmari is regarded as a very strong term of
abuse, indicating, as it does, a rogue of the worst character. In the
southern districts, the K&#257;sukkar Chettis and Sh&#257;n&#257;ns are
said to be very much trusted by the Koravas in the disposal of
property.
It is noted by Mr. H. A. Stuart<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6169src"
href="#xd21e6169" name="xd21e6169src">195 that the Koravas or
Yerukalas are a vagrant tribe found throughout the Presidency, and in
many parts of India. In the Telugu [<a id="pb441"
href="#pb441" name="pb441">441]country they are called
Yerukalav&#257;ndlu or Korachav&#257;ndlu, but they always speak of
themselves as Kurru, and there is not the slightest room for the doubt
that has been expressed regarding the identity of the Koravas and
Yerukalas. Several derivations of Yerukala have been proposed by Wilson
and others. It has been suggested, for example, that yeru is connected
with erra, meaning red. In Telugu Yerukalav&#257;ndlu would mean
fortune-tellers, and Dr. Oppert suggests that this is the origin of the
name Yerukala. He says<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6174src" href=
"#xd21e6174" name="xd21e6174src">196 &ldquo;it is highly probable
that the name and the occupation of the fortune-telling Kuruv&#257;ndlu
or Kuluv&#257;ndlu induced the Telugu people to call this tribe
Yerukulav&#257;ndlu. Dr. Oppert further connects Kurru with the root
ku, a mountain; and, in a Tamil work of the ninth century,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6177src" href="#xd21e6177" name=
"xd21e6177src">197 Kurru or Kura (Kuramagal) is given as the name
of a hill tribe.&rdquo; A strong argument in favour of the caste name
being connected with the profession of fortune-telling is afforded by
the fact that women go about the streets, calling out &ldquo;Yeruko,
amma, yeruku,&rdquo; i.e., prophecies, mother, prophecies. The
Kuravas are, Mr. Francis writes,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6184src"
href="#xd21e6184" name="xd21e6184src">198 &ldquo;a gipsy tribe
found all over the Tamil country, but chiefly in Kurnool, Salem,
Coimbatore and South Arcot. Kuravas have usually been treated as being
the same as the Yerukalas. Both castes are wandering gipsies, both live
by basket-making and fortune-telling, both speak a corrupt Tamil, and
both may have sprung from one original stock. It is noteworthy in this
connection that the Yerukalas are said to call one another Kurru or
Kura. But their names are not used as interchangeable in the districts
where each is found, and there seem to be no real differences between
[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442]the two bodies. They do not intermarry, or eat
together. The Kuravas are said to tie a piece of thread soaked in
turmeric water round the bride&rsquo;s neck at weddings, while
Yerukalas use a necklace of black beads. The Yerukalas have a tradition
that those who went to fetch the t&#257;li and pipe never returned, and
they consequently use black beads as a substitute for the t&#257;li,
and a bell for the pipe. The Kuravas worship Subramanya, the son of
Siva, while the Yerukalas worship Vishnu in the form of Venkateswara
and his wife Lakshmi. It may be noted that, in a very early Sanskrit
drama, the Br&#257;hman thief mocks Subramanya as being the patron
saint of thieves. The Kuravas treat the gentler sex in a very casual
manner, mortgaging or selling their wives without compunction, but the
Yerukalas are particular about the reputation of their womankind, and
consider it a serious matter if any of them return home without an
escort after sunset. The statistics of this year accordingly show
Yerukalas separately from Koravas. The reports from the various
districts, however, give such discrepant accounts of both castes, that
the matter is clearly in need of further enquiry.&rdquo; There is no
district in the Madras Presidency or elsewhere, where both Koravas and
Yerukalas live, unless it be the smallest possible corner of the
Coimbatore district bordering on the south-east of Mysore, for the name
Korcha intervenes; and, for a wide strip of country including the north
of the North Arcot district and south of the Cuddapah district, the
Korava is known as a Korcha, and the Census Superintendent, in common
with other authorities, has admitted these names to be synonymous. It
is in the north of the Cuddapah district that the Yerukalas first
appear in co-existence with the Korcha. The Korcha being admitted on
all sides to be the same [<a id="pb443" href=
"#pb443" name="pb443">443]as the Korava, our doubt regarding
the identity of the Korava with the Yerukala will be disposed of if we
can establish the fact that the Korcha and the Yerukala are the same.
The Rev. J. Cain, writing<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6191src" href=
"#xd21e6191" name="xd21e6191src">199 about the Yerukalas of the
God&#257;vari district, states that &ldquo;among themselves they call
each other Kuluv&#257;ru, but the Telugu people call them
Erakav&#257;ru or Erakalav&#257;ru, and this name has been derived from
the Telugu word eruka, which means knowledge or acquaintance, as they
are great fortune-tellers.&rdquo;
<img src=
"images/pl3-441.jpg" alt="Yerukalas." width="501" height="720">
Yerukalas.

According to Balfour,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6201src" href=
"#xd21e6201" name="xd21e6201src">200 the Koravas, or a certain
section of them, i.e., the Kunchi Koravas, were known as Yerkal
Koravar, and they called the language they spoke Yerkal. The same
authority, writing of the Yerkalwadu, alludes to them as Kurshiwanloo,
and goes on to say that they style themselves Yerkal, and give the same
appellation to the language in which they hold communication. The word
Yerkal here undoubtedly stands for Yerukala, and Kurshi for Korcha. It
is evident from this, supported by authorities such as Wilson,
Campbell, Brown and Shortt, that the doubt mentioned by the Census
Superintendent in regard to the identity of the Yerukala and Korava had
not arisen when the Cyclop&aelig;dia of India was published, and it is
the subsequent reports of later investigators that are responsible for
it. The divergencies of practices reported must be reckoned with, and
accounted for. They may be due to local customs existing in widely
separated areas. It is contended that the Koravas and Yerukalas do not
intermarry or eat together. A Korava, who has made a permanent home in
a village in the south, if asked whether he would marry a Yerukala,
would most [<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444]certainly answer in the negative, probably
having never heard of such a person. A circular letter, submitted to a
number of Police Inspectors in several districts, produced the same
sort of discrepant information complained of by the Census
Superintendent. But one Inspector extracted from his notes the
information that, in 1895, marriages took place between the southern
Koravas of a gang from the Madura district and the Yerukalas of the
Cuddapah district; and, further, that the son of one of a gang of
Yerukalas in the Anantapur district married a Korcha girl from a gang
belonging to the Mysore State. The consensus of opinion also goes to
prove that they will eat together. Yerukalas undoubtedly place a string
of black beads as a t&#257;li round the bride&rsquo;s neck on marriage
occasions, and the same is used by the Koravas. Information concerning
the use of a turmeric-dyed string came from only one source, namely,
Hos&#363;r in the Salem district, and it was necessary even here for
the string to be furnished with a round bottu, which might be a bead. A
plain turmeric-soaked thread appears to be more the exception than the
rule. Yerukalas are both Vaishnavites and Saivites, and a god
worshipped by any one gang cannot be taken as a representative god for
the whole class. Yerukalas may treat their womankind better than the
southern Koravas, but this is only a matter of degree, as the morals of
both are slack. The Yerukalas, occupying, as they do, the parched
centre of the peninsula, more frequently devastated by famine than the
localities occupied by the Koravas, may have learnt in a hard school
the necessity of taking care of their wives; for, if they allowed them
to pass to another man, and a drought ruined his crop and killed the
cattle, he would find it hard to procure another, the probability being
that the price of wives [<a id="pb445" href=
"#pb445" name="pb445">445]rises in a common ratio with other
commodities in a time of scarcity.
From the accounts given by them, it appears that the Koravas claim
to have originated in mythological ages. The account varies slightly
according to the locality, but the general outlines agree more or less
with the story related in the Bh&#257;gav&#257;tham. The pur&#333;hits,
or priests, are the safest guides, and it was one of them who told the
following story, culled, as he admitted, from the S&#257;stras and the
R&#257;m&#257;yana. When the great V&#275;nudu, son of Agneswathu, who
was directly descended from Brahma, ruled over the universe, he was
unable to procure a son and heir to the throne, and, when he died, his
death was looked on as an irreparable misfortune. His body was
preserved. The seven ruling planets sat in solemn conclave, and
consulted as to what they should do. Finally they agreed to create a
being from the right thigh of the deceased V&#275;nudu, and they
accordingly fashioned and gave life to Nishudu. But their work was not
successful, for Nishudu turned out to be not only deformed in body, but
repulsively ugly in face. It was agreed at another meeting of the
planets that he was not a fit person to be placed on the throne. So
they set to work again, and created a being from the right shoulder of
V&#275;nudu, and their second effort was crowned with success. They
called the second creation Proothu Chakravarthi, and, as he gave
general satisfaction, he was placed on the throne. This supersession
naturally caused the first-born Nishudu to be discontented, and he
sought a lonely place, in which he communed with the gods, begging of
them the reason why they had created him if he was not to rule. The
gods explained that he could not now be placed on the throne, as
Chakravarthi had already been installed, but <span class=
"pagenum">[446]that
he should be a ruler over forests. In this capacity Nishudu begat the
B&#333;yas, Chenchus, Y&#257;n&#257;dis, and Koravas. The B&#333;yas
were his legitimate children, but the others were all illegitimate. It
is because Nishudu watched in solemn silence to know his creator that
some of his offspring called themselves Yerukalas (yeruka, to know).
Another story explains the name Korava. When the princes
Dharmar&#257;ja and Duryodana were at variance, the former, to avoid
strife, went into voluntary exile. A woman who loved him set out in
search of him, but, through fear of being identified, disguised herself
as a fortune-teller. In this manner she found him, and their offspring
became known as Koravas, from kuru, fortune-telling.
The appellation Koracha or Korcha appears to be of later date than
Korava, and is said to be derived from the Hindustani kori (sly), korri
nigga (sly look) becoming corrupted into Korcha. Whenever this name was
applied to them, they had evidently learnt their calling thoroughly,
and the whole family, in whatever direction its branches spread,
established a reputation for cunning in snaring animals or birds, or
purloining other peoples&rsquo; goods, until to-day their names are
used for the purpose of insulting abuse in the course of a quarrel.
Thus a belligerant might call the other a thieving Yerukala, or ask, in
tones other than polite, if he belongs to a gang of Korchas. In the
Tamil country, a man is said to kura-kenju, or cringe like a Korava,
and another allusion to their dishonesty is kurapas&#257;ngu, to cheat
like a Korava. The proverb &ldquo;Kuruvan&rsquo;s justice is the ruin
of the family&rdquo; refers to the endless nature of their quarrels,
the decision of which will often occupy the headmen for weeks
together.
In communicating among themselves, the Koravas and Yerukalas speak a
corrupt polyglot, in which the words [<a id=
"pb447" href="#pb447" name="pb447">447]derived from several
languages bear little resemblance to the original. Their words appear
to be taken chiefly from Tamil, Telugu, and Canarese. A short
vocabulary of the Yerukala language has been published by the Rev. J.
Cain.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6222src" href="#xd21e6222" name=
"xd21e6222src">201 The Yerukalas call this language Oodra, which
seems to stand for gibberish or thieves&rsquo; slang, or, as they
explain, something very hard to understand. Oriya or Oodra is the
language of the districts of Ganjam and Orissa. The word Oriya means
north, and the fact that the Yerukalas call their language Oodra would
seem to confirm their belief that they are a northern tribe. The
wanderers always know more than one language colloquially, and are able
to make themselves understood by the people of the country through
which they may be passing. Those who have settled in villages
invariably speak the language of the locality. When talking among
themselves, they call a Br&#257;hman Thanniko Koravan, or the bathing
Korava. They consider the Br&#257;hmans to be more cunning than
themselves, and, as they are fond of bathing to remove pollution, they
have given them this nickname.

A detailed account of the Korava slang and patois has been published

Korava society is purely patriarchal, and, in whatever division or
sept of the caste a Korava may be born, he has to subordinate himself
to the will of his elders or the leaders of his particular gang. The
head of a gang is called the Peru Manusan or Beriya Manasan (big man).
He is selected principally because of his age, intelligence, and the
influence he commands amongst the members of the gang. It is a post
which carries with it no remuneration whatever, but the holder presides
at all consultations, and is given the position of honour at all social
functions.
Concerning the caste government, Mr. Fawcett writes that &ldquo;the
kulam or caste assembly adjudicates claims, inflicts penalties, ejects
individuals from the caste, or readmits them thereto. Free drinking of
toddy at the expense of one of the parties accompanies every caste
assembly. It is the aggrieved party who gives notice for assembly of
the kulam. The disputants join hands, thereby indicating to the kulam
that their dispute should be decided by them. Each pays one rupee. The
kulam may decide the dispute at once, or adjourn for further
consideration at any time. The next meeting is called the second
joining of hands, when each pays one rupee, as before, to be spent in
toddy. A man who fails to attend when the kulam has been convened loses
his caste absolutely. If there is a third adjournment, that is a third
joining of hands, each side pays Rs. 3&frac12; for toddy, to keep the
kulam in good spirits. As this is always the final adjournment, the
decision is sometimes [<a id="pb449" href=
"#pb449" name="pb449">449]arrived at by means of an ordeal.
An equal quantity of rice is placed in two pots of equal weight having
a quantity of water, and there is an equal quantity of firewood. The
judges satisfy themselves most carefully as to quantity, weights, and
so on. The water is boiled, and the man whose rice boils first is
declared to be the winner of the dispute. The loser is to recoup the
winner all his expenses. It sometimes happens that both pots boil at
the same time; then a coin is to be picked out of a pot containing
boiling oil. There is yet another method of settling disputes about
money. The amount claimed is brought by one party, and placed beside an
idol. The claimant is then asked to take it, and, should nothing
unpleasant happen to him or to his family afterwards, he is declared to
have made out his claim. The kulam has nothing whatever to do with
planning the execution of offences, but is sometimes called upon to
decide about the division of plunder, as, for instance, when any member
of a criminal expedition improperly secretes something for himself. But
they engage vakils (pleaders) for defending members of the gang who are
charged with a criminal offence, whether they have been concerned in it
or not.&rdquo;
There are a great many classes of Koravas, most of them obtaining
their names from the particular occupations they have followed as an
ostensible means of livelihood for many generations. But, whatever they
may call themselves, they all, according to Mr. Mainwaring, fall within
three divisions, viz.:&mdash;

1. Sakai, Sampathi, S&#257;thupadi.
2. K&#257;vadi or Gujjula.
3. D&#275;varakonda, Mendrakutti, or Menapadi.

The members of the first two divisions are pure Koravas, the
legitimate descendants of Koravas who [<a id=
"pb450" href="#pb450" name="pb450">450]have never married
outside the caste, whereas the third division represents and includes
the mixed marriages, and the offspring thereof. The Koravas receive
into their ranks members of castes other than Paraiyans (including
M&#257;las and M&#257;digas), Y&#257;n&#257;dis, Mangalas, and
Ts&#257;kalas. The ceremony of introduction into the Korava community
consists in burning the tongue with a piece of gold. The Koravas have a
strong objection to taking food touched by M&#275;daras, because, in
their professional occupation of doing wicker-work, they use an awl
which resembles the tool used by M&#257;digas in shoe-making. The
Koravas are said to be divided into two large families, which they call
P&#333;thu and P&#275;nti, meaning male and female. All the families
included in the first division noted above are P&#333;thu, and those in
the second P&#275;nti. The families in the third division, being the
product of mixed marriages, and the position of females being a lowly
one, they are also considered to be P&#275;nti. The P&#333;thu section
is said to have arisen from men going in search of brides for
themselves, and the P&#275;ntis from men going in search of husbands
for their daughters. When a Korava, male or female, wishes to marry, a
partner must be sought in a division other than their own. For example,
a Korava of the first division is bound to marry a female belonging to
the second or third division, who, after marriage, belongs to her
husband&rsquo;s division. This may be a little hard on the women of the
first division, because they are bound to descend in the social scale.
However, their daughters can rise by marrying into the first division.
For the purpose of religious ceremonies, each division has fixed
duties. The members of the first division have the right of decorating
the god, and dressing him in his festival attire. Those of the second
division carry the god and the regalia in procession, and <span class=
"pagenum">[451]burn
incense, and those of the third drag the temple car, and sing and shout
during its progress. For this reason, it is said, they are sometimes
called Bandi (cart).
&ldquo;The major divisions,&rdquo; Mr. Paupa Rao Naidu writes,
&ldquo;are four in number, and according to their gradation they are
S&#257;thep&#257;ti, K&#257;vadi, M&#257;nap&#257;ti, Mendragutti. They
are all corrupted Tamil words.

&ldquo;1. S&#257;thep&#257;ti is a corruption of
S&#257;thup&#257;di, which means adorning a Hindu deity with flowers,
jewels and vestments.
&ldquo;2. K&#257;vadi, meaning a pole carried on the shoulders with
two baskets pendant from its ends, in which are contained offerings for
a deity or temple.
&ldquo;3. M&#257;nap&#257;ti is a corruption of M&#257;npadi, which
means singing in praise of god, when He is worshipped in a temple.
&ldquo;4. Mendragutti is a corruption of Menrikutti, which means
stitching a pair of shoes, and presenting them to the temple&mdash;a
custom still prevalent at Tirupati and other important shrines.
&ldquo;Of these four divisions, the first two are, or rather were,
considered superior to the other two, a K&#257;vadi man being styled
P&#333;thuv&#257;du (man), and a S&#257;thep&#257;ti man P&#275;nti
(female).&rdquo;

A still further classification of divisions and sub-divisions is
given by Mr. F. S. Mullaly.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6351src" href=
"#xd21e6351" name="xd21e6351src">203 I am informed by Mr. C.
Hayavadana Rao that, in the Vizagapatam district, the Yerukalas are
divided into Pattapu or Odd&#275;, and Thurpu (eastern). Of these, the
former, when they are prosperous, live in tiled houses, while the
latter live in huts. Pattapu women wear brass bangles on both wrists,
and Thurpu women brass bangles on the right <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452]wrist, and glass bangles on the left. The former
throw the end of their cloth over the left shoulder, and the latter
over the right.
It is recorded, in the Gazetteer of the Trichinopoly district, that
&ldquo;the Kuravans are divided into a number of endogamous sections,
of which the &#298;na Kuravans and the K&#257;valk&#257;ran Kuravans
are the most criminal, especially the latter. The latter are also
called the Marasa, Mondu, and K&#257;dukutti Kuravans. In dress and
appearance the N&#257;makkal Kuravans are said to be superior to those
of Kar&#363;r, and to look like well-dressed Vell&#257;lans or Pallis.
They are peculiar in wearing long ear-rings. They are also said to be
much better thieves than the others, and to dislike having a Kar&#363;r
Kuravan when breaking into a house, for fear he might wake the
household by his clumsiness.&rdquo;
As examples of intip&#275;ru, or exogamous septs, the following,
which were given by Uppu Yerukalas, may be cited:&mdash;




D&#257;sari, Vaishnavite mendicant.
Sukka, star.
Kampa, bush of thorns.
&#256;vula, cows.
Thoka, tail.
K&#257;naga (Pongamia glabra).
Bandi, cart.
Gajjala, small bell.




Mogili (Pandanus fascicularis)
Uyy&#257;la, swing.
R&#257;gala, r&#257;gi grain.
P&#363;la, flowers.
Kat&#257;ri, dagger.
Ambojala, lotus.
Samudr&#257;la, sea.
Venkatagiri, a town.




&ldquo;A knowledge,&rdquo; Mr. Fawcett writes, &ldquo;of these house
or sept names may be useful in order to establish a man&rsquo;s
identity, as a Koravar, who is generally untruthful as to his own name,
is seldom if ever so as regards his house or sept name, and his
father&rsquo;s name. He considers it shameful to lie about his
parentage, &lsquo;to be born to one, and yet to give out the name of
another.&rsquo; [<a id="pb453" href="#pb453"
name="pb453">453]Totemism of some kind evidently exists, but
it is rather odd that it has not always any apparent connection with
the sept or house name. Thus, the totem of persons of the Kon&#275;ti
sept is horse-gram (kollu in Tamil), which they hold in veneration, and
will not touch, eat, or use in any way. The totem of the Samudr&#257;la
sept is the conch shell, which likewise will not be used by those of
the sept in any manner. It may be noted that persons of the
Ram&#275;swari sept will not eat tortoises, while those of the
Kon&#275;ti sept are in some manner obliged to do so on certain
occasions.&rdquo;
As regards names for specific occupations among the Koravas, the
B&#299;dar or nomad Koravas originally carried merchandise in the form
of salt, tamarinds, jaggery (crude sugar or molasses), leaves of the
curry leaf plant (Murraya K&oelig;nigii) from place to place on
pack-bullocks or donkeys. The leaves were in great demand, and those
who brought them round for sale were called in Tamil Karuvaipillai, and
in Telugu Karep&#257;ku, after the commodity which they carried. This
is a common custom in India, and when driving through the baz&#257;r,
one may hear, for example, an old woman carrying a bundle of wood
addressed as firewood. &ldquo;K&#257;vadi&rdquo; will be screamed at a
man carrying a pole (k&#257;vadi) with baskets, etc., suspended from
it, who got in the way of another. The section of Koravas who carried
salt inland from the coast became known as Uppu (salt) Koravas. Another
large class are the Thubba, Dhubbai, or Dhabbai (split bamboo) Koravas,
who restrict their wanderings to the foot of hill ranges, where bamboos
are obtainable. With these they make baskets for the storage of grain,
for carrying manure at the bottom of carts, and various fancy articles.
In the Kurnool district, the Yerukalas will only cut bamboos at the
time of the new moon, as they are then [<a id=
"pb454" href="#pb454" name="pb454">454]supposed to be free
from attacks by boring weevils, and they do certain p&#363;ja (worship)
to the goddess Malalamma, who presides over the bamboos. In the
Nallamalai forests, the Yerukalas do not split the bamboo into pieces
and remove the whole, but take off only a very thin strip consisting of
the outer rind. The strips are made up into long bundles, which can be
removed by donkeys. There is extreme danger of fire, because the inner
portions of the bamboos, left all over the forest, are most
inflammable.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6413src" href="#xd21e6413"
name="xd21e6413src">204 Instead of splitting the bamboos in the
forest, and leaving behind a lot of combustible material, the Yerukalas
now have to purchase whole bamboos, and take them outside the forest to
split them. The members of a gang of these Yerukalas, who came before
me at Nandy&#257;l, were each carrying a long split bamboo wand as an
occupational insigne. A further important section is that of the Kunchu
or Kunchil Koravas, who gather roots in the jungle, and make them into
long brushes which are used by weavers. The Koravas have a monopoly in
their manufacture, and take pride in making good brushes. These Kunchu
Koravas are excellent shik&#257;ris (hunters), and snare antelope,
partridges, duck, quail, and other game with great skill. For the
purpose of shooting antelopes, or of getting close enough to the young
ones to catch them after a short run, they use a kind of shield made of
dried twigs ragged at the edges, which looks like an enormous
wind-blown bundle of grass. When they come in sight of a herd of
antelopes, they rest one edge of the shield on the ground, and, sitting
on their heels behind it, move it slowly forward towards the herd until
they get sufficiently close to dash at the young ones, or shoot the
[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name=
"pb455">455]grown-up animals. The antelopes are supposed to
mistake the shield for a bush, and to fail to notice its gradual
approach. They capture duck and teal largely at night, and go to the
rice fields below a tank (pond or lake), in which the crop is young,
and the ground consequently not entirely obscured. This would be a
likely feeding-ground, or traces of duck having fed there on the
previous night might be noticed. They peg a creeper from one bund (mud
embankment) to another, parallel to the tank bund, four inches above
the water in the field. From this they suspend a number of running
loops made of sinews drawn from the legs of sheep or goats or from the
hind-legs of hares, the lower ends of the loops touching the mud under
water. If the duck or teal come to feed, they are sure to be caught,
and fall victims to the slip noose. &ldquo;The Kuntsu (Kunchu)
Korachas,&rdquo; Mr. Francis tells us,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6418src" href="#xd21e6418" name="xd21e6418src">205
&ldquo;catch small birds by liming twigs or an arrangement of bits of
bamboo with a worm hung inside it, or by setting horse-hair nooses
round the nests. Quails they capture by freely snaring a piece of
ground, and then putting a quail in a cage in the middle of it, to lure
the birds towards the snare. They also catch them, and partridges too,
by driving the bevy towards a collapsible net. To do this, they cover
themselves with a dark blanket, conceal their heads in a kind of big
hat made of hair, feathers and grass, and stalk the birds from a
bullock trained to the work, very gradually driving them into the net.
They also occasionally capture black-buck (antelope) by sending a tame
buck with nooses on his horns to fight with a wild one. The latter
speedily gets his horns entangled in the nooses, and is easily
secured.&rdquo; Sometimes the Kunchu [<a id=
"pb456" href="#pb456" name="pb456">456]Korava begs in
villages, dragging about with him a monkey, while the females earn a
livelihood by tattooing, which occupation, known as pricking with
green, has gained for them the name of Pacchai (green) Kutti. The
patterns used in tattooing by a Korava woman, whom I interviewed, were
drawn in a note-book, and consisted of fishes, scorpions, a fortress,
five-storeyed house, conventional designs, etc. The patterns were drawn
on the skin, with great dexterity and skill in freehand drawing, by
means of a blunt stick dipped in a mixture of a lamp-black, lamp-oil,
and turmeric contained in a half cocoanut shell. The pattern is pricked
in with a bundle of four or five needles tied together. The needles and
drawing-stick were kept in a hollow bamboo, and the tattooing mixture
in the scooped out fruits of the bael (&AElig;gle
Marmelos) and palmyra palm (Borassus
flabellifer). For tattooing an entire upper extremity, at several
sittings, the Korava woman would be paid from eight to twelve annas, or
receive food-grains in lieu of money. The hot weather is said to be
more favourable for the operation than the cold season, as the swelling
after it is less. To check this, lamp-oil, turmeric, and leaves of the
avarai plant (Dolichos Lablab) are applied.
Concerning the Pacchaikuttis, or, as they are also called, Gadde
(soothsayers), Mr. Paupa Rao Naidu writes that &ldquo;the women start
with a basket and a winnowing basket or tray into a village,
proclaiming their ostensible profession of tattooing and soothsaying,
which they do for grain or money. When unfortunate village women, who
always lose children or who often fall ill, see these Gadde women
moving about, they call them into their houses, make them sit, and,
pouring some grain into their baskets, ask them about their past
[<a id="pb457" href="#pb457" name=
"pb457">457]misery and future lot. These women, who are
sufficiently trained to speak in suitable language, are clever enough
to give out some yarns in equivocal terms, so that the anxious women,
who hope for better futurity, understand them in the light uppermost in
their own minds. The Korava women will be rewarded duly, and doubly
too, for they never fail to study the nature of the house all the time,
to see if it offers a fair field for booty to their men.&rdquo;
At Srungavarapuk&#333;ta in the Vizagapatam district &ldquo;the
local goddess, Yerakamma, is a deification of a woman who committed
sati. Ballads are sung about her, which say that she was the child of
D&#257;sari parents, and that her birth was foretold by a Yerukala
woman (whence her name) who prophesied that she would have the gift of
second sight. She eventually married, and one day she begged her
husband not to go to his field, as she was sure he would be killed by a
tiger if he did. Her husband went notwithstanding, and was slain as she
had foreseen. She committed sati on the spot where her shrine still
stands.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6439src" href="#xd21e6439"
name="xd21e6439src">206
The &#362;r or village Koravas have given up their nomad life, and
settled in villages of their own, or together with other communities.
Many of them have attended pial schools, and can read and write to some
extent. Some of them are employed in the police and salt departments,
as jail warders, etc. The &#362;r Korava is fast losing his
individuality, and assimilating, in dress, manners and customs, the
ryots among whom he dwells. In the Salem district there is a village
called Korav&#363;r, which is inhabited entirely by Koravas, who say
that they were originally Uppu Koravas, but now cultivate their
[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=
"pb458">458]own lands, or work as agricultural labourers for
the land-owners. They say further that they pay an occasional visit to
Madras for the purpose of replenishing their stock of coral and beads,
which they sell at local shandis (markets). Some Koravas are said to
buy gilded beads at Madura, and cheat unsuspecting villagers by selling
them as gold. Though the &#362;r Koravas are becoming civilised, they
have not yet lost their desire for other men&rsquo;s goods, and are
reported to be the curse of the Anantapur, Cuddapah, and Bellary
districts, where they commit robbery, house-breaking, and theft,
especially of sheep and cattle. A particularly bold sheep theft by them
a few years ago is worthy of mention. The village of Singanamalla in
the Anantapur district lies a few miles off the railway. It is bordered
on two sides by Government forest reserves, into which the villagers
regularly drove their sheep and goats to graze, in charge of small
boys, in the frequent absences of the forest watcher, or when the
watcher was well disposed towards them. An arrangement was made between
the Koravas and a meat-supplier at Bangalore to deliver on his behalf a
large number of sheep at a wayside station near Dharm&#257;varam, to
receive which trucks had to be ready, and the transaction was purely
cash. One morning, when more than a hundred sheep had been driven far
into the reserve by their youthful charges, who kept more or less close
together for the sake of company, a number of Koravas turned up, and
represented themselves as forest watchers, captured the small boys,
gagged them and tied them to trees, and drove off all the available
sheep. The boys were not discovered till late at night, and the police
did not get to work till the following morning, by which time the sheep
were safely entrained for Bangalore. [<a id=
"pb459" href="#pb459" name="pb459">459]
It is noted, in the Madras Police Report, 1905&ndash;1906, that
&ldquo;a large number of members of the notorious Rudrap&#257;d Koracha
gangs have recently been released from His Highness the Nizam&rsquo;s
prisons, and their return will add appreciably to the difficulties of
the Bellary Police.&rdquo;
A small class of Koravas is named P&#257;mula (snake), as they
follow the calling of snake-charmers. In the Census Report, 1901,
P&#363;salav&#257;du (seller of glass beads) and Utlav&#257;du (makers
of utlams) are given as sub-castes of Yerukala. An utlam is a hanging
receptacle for pots, etc., made of palmyra fibre. In the same report,
K&#257;dukuttukiravar (those who bore a hole in the ear) and Valli
Ammai K&#363;ttam (followers of the goddess Valli Ammai) are returned
as synonyms of Koravas. They claim that Valli Ammai, the wife of the
god Subrahmanya, was a Korava woman. Old Tamil books refer to the
Koravas as fortune-tellers to kings and queens, and priests to
Subrahmanya. Some Koravas have, at times of census, returned themselves
as K&#363;daikatti (basket-making) Vanniyans. Balfour refers to Walaja
Koravas, and states that they are musicians. They are probably
identical with the Wooyaloo Koravas,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6451src" href="#xd21e6451" name="xd21e6451src">207 whose duty
it is to swing incense, and sing before the god during a religious
celebration. The same writer speaks of Bajantri or Sonai Kolawaru and
Kolla and Soli Korawars, and states that they inhabit the Southern
Mar&#257;tha country. These names, like Th&#333;gamallai for Koravas
who come from the village of that name in the Trichinopoly district,
are probably purely local. Further, the Abb&eacute; Dubois states that
&ldquo;the third species of Kuravers is generally known under the name
of Kalla [<a id="pb460" href="#pb460" name=
"pb460">460]Bantru, or robbers. The last Muhammadan prince
who reigned over Mysore is said to have employed a regular battalion of
these men in time of war, not for the purpose of fighting, but to
infest the enemy&rsquo;s camp in the night, stealing away the horses
and other necessaries of the officers, and acting as spies. They were
awarded in proportion to the dexterity they displayed in these
achievements, and, in time of peace, they were despatched into the
various States of neighbouring princes, to rob for the benefit of their
masters.&rdquo; It is possible that the Kaikadis of the Central
Provinces are identical with Koravas, who have migrated thither.
A section of Koravas, called Koot (dancing) or K&#333;thee (monkey)
Kaikaries, is referred to by Mr. Paupa Rao Naidu as &ldquo;obtaining
their living by prostitution. They also kidnap or sell children for
this purpose. Some of the women of this class are thriving well in the
Madras Presidency as experts in dancing. They are kept by rich people,
and are called in the Telugu country Erukala B&#333;gamvaru, in Tamil
Korava Thevidia. They also train monkeys, and show them to the
public.&rdquo;
The household god of the Korava, which is as a rule very rudely
carved, may be a representation of either Vishnu or Siva. As already
noted, it is stated in the Census Report, 1901, that the Koravas
worship Subrahmanya, the son of Siva, while the Yerukalas worship
Vishnu in the form of Venkat&#275;swara and his wife Lakshmi. They
worship, in addition to these, Kol&#257;puriamma,
Perum&#257;lasw&#257;mi, and other appropriate deities, prior to
proceeding on a depredatory expedition. Kol&#257;puriamma is the
goddess of Kolhap&#363;r, the chief town of the Native State of that
name in the Bombay Presidency, who is famous in Southern India.
Perum&#257;lsw&#257;mi, or Venkat&#275;swara, is the god of Tirupati,
the [<a id="pb461" href="#pb461" name=
"pb461">461]great place of pilgrimage in the North Arcot
district. The signs of a recent performance of worship by Koravas may
prove an indication to the Police that they have been concerned in a
dacoity, and act as a clue to detection thereof. They sacrifice sheep
or goats once a year to their particular god on a Sunday or Tuesday,
while those who worship Venkat&#275;swara honour him on a Saturday, and
break cocoanuts as an offering. All offerings presented to the gods are
divided among those present, after the ceremonies have been completed.
Venkat&#275;swara is said to be sometimes represented, for the purpose
of worship, by a brass vessel (kalasam) decorated with flowers, and
bearing on it the Vaishnavite n&#257;mam (sect mark). Its mouth is
closed by a cocoanut, beneath which mango or betel leaves are placed.
On the day appointed for the religious service, everything within the
hut is thrown outside, and the floor is purified with cow-dung, and
devices are drawn thereon. The brass vessel is set up, and offerings of
large quantities of food are made to it. Some of this dedicated food
(pras&#257;dam) must be given to all the inhabitants of the settlement.
A lump of clay, squeezed into a conical shape, with a tuft of margosa
(Melia Azadirachta) leaves does duty for P&#333;l&#275;ramma. In
front thereof, three stones are placed. P&#333;l&#275;ramma may be
worshipped close to, but not within, the hut. To her offerings of
boiled rice (pongal) are made by fasting women. The manner in which the
boiling food bubbles over from the cooking-pot is eagerly watched, and
accepted as an omen for good or evil. In a note on the Coorroo, Balfour
states<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6467src" href="#xd21e6467" name=
"xd21e6467src">208 that &ldquo;they told me that, when they pray,
they construct a small pyramid of clay, which they term M&#257;riamma,
[<a id="pb462" href="#pb462" name=
"pb462">462]and worship it. The women had small gold and
silver ornaments suspended from cords round their necks, which they
said had been supplied to them by a goldsmith, from whom they had
ordered figures of M&#257;riamma. The form represented is that of the
goddess K&#257;li. They mentioned that they had been told by their
forefathers that, when a good man dies, his spirit enters the body of
some of the better animals, as that of a horse or cow, and that a bad
man&rsquo;s spirit gives life to the form of a dog or jackal, but they
did not seem to believe in it. They believe firmly, however, in the
existence and constant presence of a principle of evil, who, they say,
frequently appears, my informant having himself often seen it in the
dusk of the evening assuming various forms, at times a cat, anon a
goat, and then a dog, taking these shapes that it might approach to
injure him.&rdquo;
The domestic god of the Koravas, in the southern districts, is said
to be Sathavu, for whom a day of worship is set apart once in three or
four years. The Koravas assemble, and, in an open place to the west of
the village, a mud platform is erected, on which small bricks are
spread. In front of the platform are placed a sickle, sticks, and
arrack (liquor). Cocoanuts, plantain fruits, and rice are offered, and
sheep sacrificed. Sandal and turmeric are poured over the bricks, and
camphor is burnt. The proceedings terminate with a feast.
The presiding goddess of the criminal profession of the Koravas is
stated by Mr. M. Paupa Rao Naidu<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6476src"
href="#xd21e6476" name="xd21e6476src">209 to be Mooth&#275;vi, the
goddess of sleep, whom they dread and worship more than any other god
or goddess of the [<a id="pb463" href="#pb463"
name="pb463">463]Hindu Pantheon. The object of this worship
is twofold, one being to keep themselves vigilant, and the other to
throw their victims off their guard. Mooth&#275;vi is invoked in their
prayers to keep them sleepless while on their nefarious purpose bent,
but withal to make their victims sufficiently sleepy over their
property. This goddess is worshipped especially by females, who perform
strange orgies periodically, to propitiate her. A secluded spot is
preferred for performing these orgies, at which animal sacrifices are
made, and there is distribution of liquor in honour of the goddess. The
Edayapatti gang worship in addition the deity Ratnasabhapathy at
Ayyamala. When prosecuted for a crime, the Koravan invokes his
favourite deity to let him off with a whipping in the words &lsquo;If
the punishment of whipping be inflicted I shall adore the
goddess.&rsquo;
The following account of a peculiar form of human sacrifice by the
Koravas in former days was given to Mr. C. Hayavadana Rao by an old
inhabitant of the village of &#256;s&#363;r near Walajabad in the
Chingleput district. A big gang settled at the meeting point of the
three villages of &#256;s&#363;r, M&#275;lputt&#363;r, and Aval&#363;r,
on an elevated spot commanding the surrounding country. They had with
them their pack-bullocks, each headman of the gang owning about two
hundred head. The cow-dung which accumulated daily attracted a good
many of the villagers, on one of whom the headmen fixed as their
intended victim. They made themselves intimate with him, plied him with
drink and tobacco, and gave him the monopoly of the cow-dung. Thus a
week or ten days passed away, and the Koravas then fixed a day for the
sacrifice. They invited the victim to visit them at dusk, and witness a
great festival in honour of their caste goddess. At the appointed hour,
the man went [<a id="pb464" href="#pb464" name=
"pb464">464]to the settlement, and was induced to drink
freely. Meanwhile, a pit, large enough for a man to stand upright in
it, had been prepared. At about midnight, the victim was seized, and
forced to stand in the pit, which was filled in up to his neck. This
done, the women and children of the gang made off with their
belongings. As soon as the last of them had quitted the settlement, the
headmen brought a large quantity of fresh cow-dung, and placed a ball
of it on the head of the victim. The ball served as a support for an
earthen lamp, which was lighted. The man was by this time nearly dead,
and the cattle were made to pass over his head. The headmen then made
off, and, by daybreak, the whole gang had disappeared. The murdered man
was found by the villagers, who have, since that time, scrupulously
avoided the Koravas. The victim is said to have turned into a
Munisvara, and for a long time troubled those who happened to go near
the spot at noon or midnight. The Koravas are said to have performed
the sacrifice so as to insure their cattle against death from disease.
The ground, on which they encamped, and on which they offered the human
sacrifice, is stated to have been barren prior thereto, and, as the
result thereof, to have become very fertile.
It is said that Korava women invoke the village goddesses when they
are telling fortunes. They use a winnowing fan and grains of rice in
doing this, and prophesy good or evil, according to the number of
grains found on the fan.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6488src" href=
"#xd21e6488" name="xd21e6488src">210 They carry a basket, winnow,
stick, and a wicker tray in which cowry shells are imbedded in a
mixture of cow-dung, and turmeric. The basket represents
Kol&#257;puriamma and the cowries [<a id="pb465"
href="#pb465" name="pb465">465]P&#333;l&#275;ramma. When
telling fortunes, the Korava woman places on the basket the winnow,
rice, betel leaves and areca nuts, and the wicker tray. Holding her
client&rsquo;s hand over the winnow, and moving it about, she commences
to chant, and name all sorts of deities. From time to time she touches
the hand of the person whose fortune is being told with the stick. The
Korava women are very clever in extracting information concerning the
affairs of a client before they proceed to tell her fortune.

Korava Woman Telling Fortune.

Br&#257;hmans fix the auspicious hour for marriage, and Chettis are
invited to act as priests at the purification ceremony for re-admission
into caste of a man or woman who has cohabited with a Paraiyan or
Muhammadan, or been beaten with a shoe, etc. For the purpose of
re-admission, a panch&#257;yat (council) assembles, at which the
headman presides. Enquiries are made into the conduct of the accused,
and a fine of two rupees levied. Of this sum the Chetti receives eight
annas, with some betel and tobacco. The balance is spent in liquor for
those who are assembled. After the Chetti has received his fee, he
smears the foreheads of the guilty person and the company with sacred
ashes. The impure person goes to a stream or well, and bathes. He then
again comes before the council, and is purified by the Chetti again
marking his forehead. The proceedings wind up with a feast. In former
days, at a trial before a council, the legs of the complainant and
accused were tied together. In 1907, a Koracha was excommunicated for
having illicit intercourse with a widow. The ceremony of
excommunication usually consists of shaving the head and moustache of
the guilty person, and making him ride a donkey, wearing a necklace of
bones. In the case under reference, a donkey could not be procured, so
a temporary shed was made of sajja [<a id="pb466"
href="#pb466" name="pb466">466](Setaria italica)
stalks, which were set on fire after the man had passed through it. He
was to be re-admitted into the caste by standing a feast to all the
members of five gangs of Korachas.
It is said<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6507src" href="#xd21e6507"
name="xd21e6507src">211 that &ldquo;a curious custom of the
Kuravans prohibits them from committing crime on new-moon or full-moon
days. Once started on an expedition, they are very determined and
persistent. There is a case on record where one of a band of Kuravans
out on an expedition was drowned in crossing the Cauvery. Nothing
daunted by the loss or the omen, they attempted a burglary, and failed.
They then tried another house, where they also failed; and it was not
till they had met with these three mishaps that their determination
weakened, and they went home.&rdquo;
The Koravas are extremely superstitious, and take careful notice of
good or bad omens before they start on a criminal expedition. They hold
a feast, at which the assistance of the goddess Kol&#257;puriamma or
Perum&#257;l is sought. A young goat, with coloured thread attached to
its horns, and a garland of margosa leaves with a piece of turmeric
round its neck, is taken to an out-of-the-way shrine. Here it is placed
before the deity, and cocoanuts are broken. The god is asked whether
the expedition will be successful. If the body of the animal quivers,
it is regarded as an answer in the affirmative; if it does not, the
expedition will be abandoned. If in addition to quivering, the animal
urinates, no better sign could be hoped for. The Koravas make it a
point of honour to pay for the goat used for this religious purpose. It
was information of this ceremony having been performed which led to the
[<a id="pb467" href="#pb467" name=
"pb467">467]detection of a torchlight dacoity in the
Cuddapah district in 1896. The expedition was in the first instance
successful, for the Koravas broke into a K&#333;mati&rsquo;s house in
the middle of a village, and carried off a quantity of jewels. The
K&#333;mati&rsquo;s arm was broken, and he and other inmates of the
house were badly burnt by lighted torches thrust against their faces
and bodies. Among other methods of consulting the omens is to sacrifice
a fowl at a shrine, and sit in front thereof listening for the
direction whence the chirping of lizards issues. If the omens are
auspicious, the members of the expedition start off, armed as a rule
with l&#257;tis (sticks) and axes. If they attack a cart, they commence
by throwing stones at it, to ascertain if the occupant has fire-arms
with him. Houses are generally broken into by means of a hole made in
the wall near the door-latch. In the Ceded Districts, where the houses
are as a rule substantially built of rough stone, and have flat roofs
of salt earth, an opening is frequently effected through the roof. The
Koravas are often extremely cruel in the methods which they adopt to
extort information from inhabitants of houses as to where their
valuables are concealed. In common with other Hindus, they avoid the
shadow of the thandra tree (Terminalia belerica), in which the
spirit of San&#275;swaradu is believed to reside. In this connection
the following legend is recited.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6517src"
href="#xd21e6517" name="xd21e6517src">212 In the city of
B&#299;manapuram there ruled a king named B&#299;mar&#257;ju, who had a
beautiful daughter named Damayanti, with whom the gods, including
Nalamah&#257;r&#257;ju, fell in love. Damayanti had never seen
Nalamah&#257;r&#257;ju, but loved him on account of the stories which
reached her of the justice with which he governed his kingdom, and his
chastity. [<a id="pb468" href="#pb468" name=
"pb468">468]To avoid being charged with partiality in
disposing of his daughter&rsquo;s hand, B&#299;mar&#257;ju determined
to invite all the gods to his house, and the one to whom Damayanti
should throw a garland of flowers should claim her as his wife. The day
fixed on arrived, and all the gods assembled, except San&#275;swaradu,
who appears to have been unavoidably detained. The gods were seated in
a circle, and a fly guided Damayanti to Nalamah&#257;r&#257;ju, on
whose neck she threw the garland. Nalamah&#257;r&#257;ju at once
claimed her as his wife, and started off with her to his kingdom. On
the way they met San&#275;swaradu, who demanded an explanation of their
being in each other&rsquo;s company. He was told, and was very angry
because the matter had been settled in his absence, and swore a mighty
oath that they should be separated. To this end, he caused all sorts of
difficulties to come in their way. Under his spell,
Nalamah&#257;r&#257;ju took to gambling, and lost all his property. He
was separated from Damayanti, and lived in poverty for years. The spell
of San&#275;swaradu could, however, only last for a certain number of
years, and, when the time expired Nalamah&#257;r&#257;ju set out for
B&#299;manapuram, to find Damayanti who had returned to her
father&rsquo;s house. On the way, under a thandra tree, he met
San&#275;swaradu, who confessed that he was the cause of all the
troubles that had befallen him, and begged that he would look leniently
on his fault. Nalamah&#257;r&#257;ju would not forgive him, but, after
cursing him, ordained that he should live for ever in the thandra tree,
so that the area over which he could do wrong should be limited. It is
for this reason that all wandering tribes avoid pitching a camp within
the shadow of this tree. A tree (Terminalia Catappa) belonging
to the same genus as the thandra is regarded as a lucky one to camp
beneath, as it was [<a id="pb469" href="#pb469"
name="pb469">469]under one of these trees that R&#257;ma
made a bower when he lived with S&#299;ta and Lakshmana after his
banishment to the forest of Dandaka.
In connection with omens and superstitions, Mr. Fawcett writes as
follows. &ldquo;Koravas, being highly superstitious, are constantly on
the look-out for omens, especially before starting out on an excursion
when the objective is dacoity or housebreaking. The household deity,
represented by a brick picked up at random, is worshipped, and a sheep
or fowl is sacrificed. Water is first poured over the animal, and, if
it shakes its body, the omen is good, while, if it stands perfectly
still, there is misfortune ahead. It is unfortunate, when starting, to
see widows, pots of milk, dogs urinating, a man leading a bull, or a
bull bellowing. On the other hand, it is downright lucky when a bull
bellows at the scene of the criminal operation. To see a man goading a
bull is a good omen when starting, and a bad one at the scene.
Sprinkling urine over doors and walls of a house facilitates breaking
into it. The failure of an expedition is generally attributed to the
evil eye, or the evil tongue, whose bad effects are evinced in many
ways. If the excursion has been for housebreaking, the housebreaking
implement is often soldered at its sharp end with panchalokam (five
metals), to counteract the effect of the evil eye. The evil tongue is a
frequent cause of failure. It consists in talking evil of others, or
harping on probable misfortunes. There are various ways of removing its
unhappy effects. A mud figure of a man is made on the ground, and
thorns are placed over the mouth. This is the man with the evil tongue.
Those who have suffered walk round it, crying out and beating their
mouths; the greater the noise, the better the effect. Cutting the neck
of a fowl half through and allowing it to flutter about, or inserting
[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name=
"pb470">470]a red hot splinter in its anus to madden it with
pain, are considered to be effective, while, if a cock should crow
after its neck has been cut, calamities are averted. The fowl is a sort
of adjunct to the Koravar&rsquo;s life. In early childhood, the first
experiments in his career consist in stealing fowls; in manhood he
feasts on them when he is well off, and he uses them, as we have seen,
with abominable cruelty for divination or averting misfortune. The
number seven is considered ominous, and an expedition never consists of
seven men. The word for the number seven in Telugu resembles the word
for weeping, and is considered to be unlucky. A man who has returned
from jail, or who has been newly married, is not as a rule taken on an
expedition. In the case of the former, the rule may be set aside by
bringing a lamb from a neighbouring flock. A man who forgets to bring
his stick, or to equip or arm himself properly, is always left behind.
As in the case of dacoities, seven is an unlucky number to start out
for housebreaking, but, should it be unavoidable, a fiction is indulged
in of making the housebreaking implement the eighth member of the gang.
When there are dogs about a house, they are soon kept quiet with
powdered gajjakai or ganja leaves mixed with cooked rice, which they
eat greedily. Detached parties in the jungle or elsewhere are able to
unite by making sounds like the howling of jackals or hooting of owls.
The direction taken on a road, or in the forest, is indicated by
throwing the leaves of the tang&#275;du (Cassia auriculata)
along the road. At crossroads, the road taken is indicated by the thick
end of a twig of the tang&#275;du placed under a stone. Rows of stones,
one piled over the other, are also used to point out the route taken
when crossing hills. The women resort to divination, but not
accompanied by cruelty, [<a id="pb471" href=
"#pb471" name="pb471">471]when their husbands are long
enough absent to arouse apprehension of danger. A long piece is pulled
out of a broom, and to one end of it are tied several small pieces
dipped in oil. If the stick floats in water, all is well; but, should
it sink, two of the women start out at once to find the men. They
generally know as a matter of pre-arrangement whereabouts to find them,
and proceed thither, pretending to sell karipak (curry leaves). The
eighteenth day of the Tamil month Avani is the luckiest day of all for
committing crimes. A successful criminal exploit on this day ensures
good luck throughout the year. Sundays, which are auspicious for
weddings, are inauspicious for crimes. Mondays, Wednesdays and
Saturdays are unlucky until noon for starting out from home. So, too,
is the day after new moon. Fridays are unsuitable for breaking into the
houses of Br&#257;hmans or K&#333;matis, as they may be engaged in
worshipping Ankalamma, to whom the day is sacred.&rdquo;
Many Koravas examined by Mr. Mainwaring were injured in one way or
another. One man had his left nostril split, and explained that it was
the result of a bite by another Korava in the course of a drunken brawl
at a toddy-shop. Another had lost some of his teeth in a similar
quarrel, and a third was minus the lobe of his right ear.
A characteristic of the Koravas, which is well marked, is their
hairlessness. They have plenty of straight hair on the head, but their
bodies are particularly smooth. Even the pubic hairs are scanty, and
the abdominal hairs are abundant only in a few instances. The Korava is
not, in appearance, the typical criminal of one&rsquo;s imagination, of
the Bill Sykes type. That even the innocent looking individuals are
criminal by nature, the following figures establish. In 1902, there
were [<a id="pb472" href="#pb472" name=
"pb472">472]739 Koravas, or Korchas as they are called in
the Anantapur district, on the police registers as members of wandering
gangs or ordinary suspects. Of these, no less than 215, or 29 per
cent., had at least one conviction recorded against them. In the
Nellore district, in 1903, there were 54 adult males on the register,
of whom no less than 24, or 44 per cent., had convictions against them.
In the Salem district, in the same year, there were 118 adult male
Koravas registered, against 38, or 32.2 per cent. of whom convictions
stood. There are, of course, hundreds who escape active surveillance by
assuming an ostensible means of livelihood, and allowances must be made
for the possibility of numbers escaping conviction for offences they
may have committed. The women are equally criminal with the men, but
are less frequently caught. They have no hesitation in concealing small
articles by passing them into the vagina. The best way of ascertaining
whether this has been done is said to be to make them jump. In this
way, at a certain feast, a gold jewel was recovered from a woman, and
she was convicted.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6543src" href=
"#xd21e6543" name="xd21e6543src">213 This expedient is, however,
not always effectual. A case came under notice, in 1901, at the Kolar
gold fields, in which a woman had a small packet of stolen gold amalgam
passed to her during the search of the house by her husband, who was
suspected. She begged permission to leave the house to urinate. The
request was granted, and a constable who went with her on her return
reported her conduct as suspicious. A female searcher was procured, and
the parcel found jammed transversely in the vagina, and required
manipulation to dislodge it. Small jewels, which the Koravas manage to
steal, are at once [<a id="pb473" href="#pb473"
name="pb473">473]concealed in the mouth, and even swallowed.
When swallowed, the jewel is next day recovered with the help of a
purgative. In this way a half sovereign was recovered a few years
ago.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6550src" href="#xd21e6550" name=
"xd21e6550src">214 Male Koravas sometimes conceal stolen articles
in the rectum. In the Tanjore district a Korava K&#275;pmari, who was
suspected of having resorted to this dodge, was examined by a medical
officer, and two thin gold chains, each about 14 inches long, were
extracted. The females take an important part in resisting an attempt
to arrest the males. I am informed that, &ldquo;when a raid is made on
an encampment, the males make off, while the females, stripping
themselves, dance in a state of nudity, hoping thereby to attract the
constables to them, while the males get clear away. Should, however,
these man&oelig;uvres fail to attain their object, the females proceed
to lacerate the pudenda, from which blood flows profusely. They then
lie down as if dead. The unfortunate constables, though proof against
amorous advances, must perforce assist them in their distress. If it
comes to searching Korava huts, the females take a leading part in
attacking the intruders, and will not hesitate to stone them, or break
chatties (earthen pots) on their heads.&rdquo;
It is recorded, in the Cuddapah Manual, that &ldquo;a Yerukala came
to a village, and, under the pretence of begging, ascertained which
women wore jewels, and whether the husbands of any such were employed
at night in the fields. In the night he returned, and, going to the
house he had previously marked, suddenly snatched up the sleeping woman
by the massive kamma (gold ear-ring) she wore, sometimes with such
violence as to lift up the woman, and always in such a way as to
[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474]wrench off the lobe of the ear. This trick he
repeated in three different hamlets of the same village on one night,
and in one house on two women. In one case, the woman had been lifted
so high that, when the ear gave way, she fell to the ground, and
severely injured her head.&rdquo; A new form of house robbery is said
to have been started by the Koravas in recent years. They mark down the
residence of a woman, whose jewels are worth stealing, and lurk outside
the house before dawn. Then, when the woman comes out, as is the
custom, before the men are stirring, they snatch her ear-rings and
other ornaments, and are gone before an alarm can be raised.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6558src" href="#xd21e6558" name=
"xd21e6558src">215 Another favourite method of securing jewelry is
for the Korava to beg for rice, from door to door, on a dark night,
crying &ldquo;Sandi bichcham, Amma, Sandi bichcham&rdquo; (night alms,
mother, night alms). Arrived at the house of his victim, he cries out,
and the lady of the house brings out a handful of rice, and puts it in
his pot. As she does so, he makes a grab at her t&#257;li or other neck
ornament, and makes off with the spoil.
&ldquo;Stolen property&rdquo;, Mr. Mullaly writes,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e6563src" href="#xd21e6563" name="xd21e6563src">216
&ldquo;is disposed of, as soon as they can get a suitable remuneration.
The general bargain is Re. I for a rupee&rsquo;s weight of gold. They
do not, however, as a rule, lose much over their transactions, and
invariably convert their surplus into sovereigns. In searching a
Koravar encampment on one occasion, the writer had the good fortune to
discover a number of sovereigns which, for safe keeping, were stitched
in the folds of their pack saddles. Undisposed of property, which had
been buried, is brought to the encampment at nightfall, and taken back
and re-buried before dawn. The ground round the pegs, to which
[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name=
"pb475">475]their asses are tethered, in heaps of ashes or
filth, are favourite places for burying plunder.&rdquo;
The Koravas disguise themselves as K&#275;pmaris, Alagiris or
p&#363;j&#257;ris. The terms K&#275;pmari, Alagiri, Kathiriv&#257;ndlu,
etc., are applied to certain persons who adopt particular methods in
committing crime, all of which are adopted by the Koravas. The Tamil
equivalent of K&#275;pmari is Talapa Mathi, or one who changes his
head-dress. Alagiris are thieves who worship at the temple of Kalla
Alagar near Madura, and vow that a percentage of their ill-gotten gains
will be given as an offering to his temple. Kathiriv&#257;ndlu
(scissors people) are those who operate with knives or scissors,
snipping off chains, cutting the strings of purses, and ripping open
bags or pockets.
The Koravas are not nice as regards the selection of some of their
food. Cats, fowls, fish, pigs, the black-faced monkey known in Telugu
as kondamuchu, jackals, field rats, deer, antelope, goats and sheep
serve as articles of dietary. There is a Tamil proverb &ldquo;Give an
elephant to a pandit, and a cat to a Kuravan.&rdquo; They will not eat
cattle or buffaloes, and will not take food in company with
Muhammadans, barbers, washermen, carpenters, goldsmiths, blacksmiths,
Paraiyans or Chakkiliyans. The B&#333;yas seem to be the lowest class
with whom they will eat. They drink heavily when funds are available,
or at social gatherings, when free drinks are forthcoming. At council
meetings liquor must be supplied by the disputants, and there is a
proverb, &ldquo;With dry mouths nothing can be uttered.&rdquo;
Most Koravas possess knives, and a kind of billhook, called
koduv&#257;l, which is a sort of compromise between a sword and a
sickle. The back of the blade is heavy, and renders it capable of
dealing a very severe [<a id="pb476" href=
"#pb476" name="pb476">476]blow. With this implement animals
are slaughtered, murders committed, and bamboos split.
For the purpose of committing burglaries, the Koravas are said by
Mr. Mullaly to use an iron instrument pointed at either end, called
g&#257;di k&#333;lu or sillu k&#333;lu, which is offered, before a gang
sets out, to Perum&#257;l, whose aid in the success of the undertaking
is invoked.
The Koravas as a class are industrious, and generally doing
something. One may see the men on the march twisting threads into stout
cord. Others will be making fine nets for fishing, or coarse ones, in
which to suspend household pots or utensils; straw pads, on which the
round-bottomed chatties invariably stand; or a design with red thread
and cowry shells, wherewith to decorate the head of a bull or a
money-bag. It is when hawking these articles from door to door that the
Koravas are said to gain information as to property which may be worth
stealing. The following is a free translation of a song representing
Koracha characteristics, in a play by Mr. D. Krishnamacharlu, a
well-known amateur dramatist of Bellary:&mdash;


Hurrah! Our Koracha caste is a very fine caste,
The best of castes, Hurrah!


When a temple feast is proceeding,
We beg, and commit thefts surprising.
Don&rsquo;t we? Care we for aught?
Don&rsquo;t we slip off uncaught?


(Chorus.)


Cutting trinkets off,
From the necks of babes in their mothers&rsquo;
arms.
Who could suspect us? Cannot we hoodwink them all?
Cannot we get away?


(Chorus.)

[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name=
"pb477">477]

When those eternal watchmen catch us,
After endless search take life out of us.
Do we blurt out? Do we confess?
Don&rsquo;t we enquire what is our offence?


(Chorus.)


In the south, the Koravas are frequently employed by
villagers as watchmen (k&#257;valgars) on the principle of setting a
thief to keep other thieves off. They are paid in grain. The villagers
are more than half afraid of them, and, if the remuneration stipulated
upon is not promptly paid to the watchmen, a house-breaking will
certainly occur in the village. If a crime happens to take place in a
village where a Korava has been appointed watchman, he frequently
manages to get back the stolen property if the theft is the work of
another Korava, but only on condition that the police are not called in
to investigate the offence.
<img src=

Yerukala Settlement.

The dwellings in which the Koravas live are made with low mud walls
and thatched. The wanderers erect a temporary hut called gudis&#275;,
with mats or cocoanut or palmyra palm leaves, not more than 4 feet
high. It is constructed of crossed bamboos tied together, and connected
by another bamboo, which serves as a ridge, over which they fasten the
mats.
Marriages are arranged by the elders. The father of a youth who is
of a marriageable age calls together some of the elders of his
division, and proceeds in quest of a suitable bride. If the family
visited consents to the match, the headman is sent for, and a move is
made to the toddy-shop. Here the father of the future bridegroom fills
a small earthen vessel, called in Telugu muntha, and offers it to the
father of the bride-elect, asking him, Do you know why I give you this
toddy? The recipient replies, It is because I have given you
[<a id="pb478" href="#pb478" name=
"pb478">478]my daughter, and I drink to her health. The
vessel is refilled and offered to the headman, who takes it, and
enquires of the father of the girl why he is to drink. The reply is,
Because I have given my daughter to &mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s son; drink
to her health. The questions and answers are repeated while every one
present, according to rank, has a drink. Those who have so drunk at
this betrothal ceremony are looked upon as witnesses to the contract.
After the drinking ceremony, an adjournment is made to the girl&rsquo;s
house, where a feast is partaken of. At the conclusion thereof, the
future bridegroom&rsquo;s people enquire if the girl has a maternal
uncle, to whom the purchase money should be paid. The purchase money is
101 madas (a mada = two rupees), and is always the same for both
well-to-do and poor. But, as a matter of fact, the whole of it is never
paid. A few instalments are sometimes handed over, but generally the
money is the cause of endless quarrels. When, however, the families,
are on good terms, and the husband enjoys the hospitality of his
wife&rsquo;s maternal uncle, or vice vers&acirc;, it is a common
thing for one to say to the other after a drink, See, brother-in-law, I
have paid you two madas to-day, so deduct this from the v&#333;li
(purchase money). After the marriage has been arranged, and the
maternal uncle has paid four annas as an earnest of the transaction,
the party disperses until such time as the principals are in a position
to perform the wedding. They might be infants, or the girl immature, or
the intended husband be away. After the betrothal ceremony, the parents
of the girl should on no account break off the match. If this were
done, the party of the husband-elect would summon those who were
present at the drinking ceremony to a meeting, and he who partook of
the second drink (the headman) [<a id="pb479"
href="#pb479" name="pb479">479]would demand from the father
of the girl an explanation of the breach of contract. No explanation is
likely to be satisfactory, and the father is fined three hundred
var&#257;has.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6643src" href="#xd21e6643"
name="xd21e6643src">217 This sum, like the purchase money, is
seldom paid, but the award of it places the party from whom it is due
in a somewhat inferior position to the party to whom it is payable.
They occupy thenceforth the position of creditor to debtor. On the
occasion of quarrels, no delicate sense of refinement restrains the
former from alluding to the debt, and the position would be retained
through several generations. There is a Tamil proverb that the quarrels
of a Korava and an Idaiyan are not easily settled. If the contracting
parties are ready to fulfil their engagement, the maternal uncle of the
girl is paid five var&#257;has as the first instalment of the purchase
money, and a Br&#257;hman pur&#333;hit is asked to fix an auspicious
time for the marriage ceremony. At the appointed time, the wedding
party assembles at the home of the bride, and the first day is spent in
eating and drinking, the bride and bridegroom being arrayed in new
clothes purchased at the expense of the bride&rsquo;s father. On the
following day, they again feast. The contracting couple are seated on a
kambli (blanket), on which some grains of rice have been previously
sprinkled. The guests form a circle round them, and, at the auspicious
moment, the bridegroom ties a string of black beads round the
bride&rsquo;s neck. When the string has been tied, the married women
present, with hands crossed, throw rice over the heads of the pair.
This rice has been previously prepared, and consists of five seers of
rice with five pieces of turmeric, dried cocoanut, dried date fruit and
jaggery (crude sugar), and five silver or copper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href="#pb480" name=
"pb480">480]coins. While the rice-throwing is proceeding, a
monotonous song is crooned, of which the following is a free
translation:&mdash;

Procure five white bulls.
Get five white goats.
Obtain a seer<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6655src" href=
"#xd21e6655" name="xd21e6655src">218 of silver.
Get a seer of gold.
Always love your father
And live happy for ever.
Look after your mother always,
Your father and mother-in-law.
Do not heed what folk say.
Look after your relations,
And the God above will keep you happy.
Five sons and four daughters
Shall compose your family.

A predominance of sons is always considered desirable,
and, with five sons and four daughters, the mystic number nine is
reached.
No widows, women who have remarried, or girls dedicated as
prostitutes, are allowed to join the wedding circle, as they would be
of evil omen to the bride. Widows and remarried women must have lost a
husband, and the prostitute never knows the God to whose service she is
dedicated. On the third day, the rice-throwing ceremony is repeated,
but on this occasion the bride and bridegroom pour some of the rice
over each other&rsquo;s heads before the women officiate. This ends the
marriage ceremony, but, as among some other classes, consummation is
prohibited for at least three months, as a very strong superstition
exists that three heads should not enter a door within one year. The
bride and bridegroom are the first two heads to enter the new home,
[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name=
"pb481">481]and the birth of a child within the year would
constitute the third. This undesirable event is rendered less likely by
a postponement of consummation. After the prescribed time has lapsed,
the bride, with feigned reluctance, is escorted by her female relations
to her husband&rsquo;s hut. On the way obscene pleasantries, which
evoke much merriment, are indulged in. The bride&rsquo;s pretended
reluctance necessitates a certain amount of compulsion, and she is
given an occasional shove. Finally, she is thrust into the door of the
hut, and the attendant women take their departure.
The following details in another form of the marriage rites may be
noted. The bridegroom proceeds on a Saturday to the settlement of the
bride, where a hut has been set up for him close to that of the bride.
Both the huts should face the east. On the following day, the headman,
or an elder, brings a tray containing betel, flowers and kankanams
(wrist-threads). He ties the threads round the wrists of the bride and
bridegroom, and also round a pestle and mortar and a crowbar. A
distribution of rice to all present, including infants, follows, and
pork and mutton are also distributed. Towards evening, married women
go, with music produced by beating on a brass tray, to a well or tank,
with three pots beneath a canopy (ulladam). The pots are filled with
water, and placed near the marriage milk-post. The bride takes her seat
on a plank, and the bridegroom is carried on the shoulders of his
brother-in-law, and conducted to another plank. Three married women,
and some old men, then pour rice over the heads of the pair, while the
following formula is repeated: &ldquo;Try to secure four pairs of
donkeys, a few pigs and cattle; live well and amicably; feed your
guests well; grow wise and live.&rdquo; The couple are then taken to
the bride&rsquo;s hut, the [<a id="pb482" href=
"#pb482" name="pb482">482]entrance to which is guarded by
several married women, who will not allow them to enter till the
bridegroom has given out the name of the bride. Within the hut, the
pair exchange food three times, and what remains after they have eaten
is finished off by some married men and women. That night the pair
sleep in the bride&rsquo;s hut, together with the best man and
bridesmaid. On the following day, a feast is held, at which every house
must be represented by at least one married woman. Towards evening, the
bridegroom takes the bride to his hut, and, just before they start, her
mother ties up some rice in her cloth. At the entrance to the hut, a
basket, called Kol&#257;puriamma&rsquo;s basket, is placed. Depositing
a winnowing tray thereon, the bride pours the rice which has been given
to her on it. The rice is then transferred by the bridegroom to the
mortar, and he and the bride pound it with the pestle and crowbar. The
t&#257;li is then tied by the bridegroom round the bride&rsquo;s
neck.
In connection with marriage, Mr. Fawcett writes as follows. &ldquo;A
girl&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s son has the right to have
her to wife, and, if his right is abrogated by giving her to another,
he (or his father?) receives a penalty from the man to whom she is
given. The girl&rsquo;s maternal uncle disposes of the girl. In the
Coimbatore district, however, it is the father who is said to do so;
indeed it is said that the father can even take a girl away from her
husband, and give her to another for a higher bride-price. Prior to
marriage proper, there is the betrothal, accompanied by presentation of
betel leaves and draughts of toddy, when the maternal uncle or father
repeats a regular formula which is answered word for word by the
girl&rsquo;s party, in which he agrees to hand over the girl for such a
price, at the same time [<a id="pb483" href=
"#pb483" name="pb483">483]requiring that she shall receive
no bodily injury or have her hair cut, and, if she is returned damaged
physically, payment shall be made according to a fixed rate. It should
be said that the betrothal sometimes takes place at a tavern, the
favourite haunt of the Koravas, where the bridegroom&rsquo;s party
offers a pail of toddy to the father of the girl and his party. The
emptying of this pail seals the marriage contract, and involves the
father of the girl into payment of the bride-price as a fine, together
with a fine of Rs. 2 for every male child, and Rs. 4 for every female
child that may be born. This penalty, which is known as ranku, is not,
as a rule, pressed at once, but only after some children have been
born. The day of marriage, generally a Sunday, is fixed by a
Br&#257;hman, who receives betel nuts, cocoanuts, one rupee, or even
less. He selects an auspicious day and hour for the event. The hour
selected is rather early in the evening, so that the marriage may be
consummated the same night. A few days before the appointed day, two
unmarried lads cut a branch of the n&#257;val tree (Eugenia
Jambolana), and throw it into a tank (pond) or river, where it is
left until the wedding day, when the same two lads bring it back, and
plant it in the ground near the dwelling of the bride, and on either
side of it is placed a pot of water (brought from the tank or river
where the branch had been left to soak) carried thither by two married
women under a canopy. The mouth of each pot is closed by placing on top
an earthen vessel on which is a lamp. The bride and bridegroom sit on
donkey saddles spread on the ground, and undergo the nalugu ceremony,
in which their hands and feet are rubbed nine times with saffron
(turmeric) coloured red with chunam (lime). The elders bless the
couple, throwing rice over their heads with crossed hands, and
[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484" name=
"pb484">484]all the while the women chant monotonously a
song such as this:&mdash;

Galianame Baipokame Sobaname,
Oh, Marriage giver of happiness and prosperity!
The best oil of Madanapalle is this nalugu;
The best soap seed of Silakat is for this nalugu;
Paint yourselves, Oh sisters, with the best of
colours;
Stain your cloth, Oh brother, with the best of
dyes;
Bring, Oh brother, the greenest of snakes;
Adorn with it our Basavayya&rsquo;s neck;
Bring, Oh brother, the flowers without leaves;
Adorn with them the hair of the bride.

Then the bridegroom ties the bride&rsquo;s t&#257;li,
a string coloured yellow with saffron (turmeric), or a string of small
black beads. Every married woman must wear a necklet of black beads,
and glass bangles on her wrists; when she becomes a widow, she must
remove them. A feature of the ceremony not to be overlooked is the
wedding meal (pendlikudu). After undergoing the nalugu, the bridegroom
marks with a crowbar the spot where this meal, consisting of rice,
milk, green gram, and jaggery (sugar), is to be cooked in a pot called
bh&#363;palakunda. A trench is dug at the spot, and over it the cooking
is done. When the food is ready, the bride and bridegroom take of it
each three handfuls, and then the boys and girls snatch the pot away
from them. After this, the couple proceed to the bridegroom&rsquo;s
hut, where they find a light burning. The elders sprinkle them with
water coloured yellow with saffron (turmeric) as they enter.&rdquo;
For the following note on marriage among the Yerukalas of the
Vizagapatam district, I am indebted to Mr. Hayavadana Rao. A man may
marry the daughter of his paternal aunt or maternal uncle. The father
of the would-be husband of a girl goes with ten rupees, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href="#pb485" name=
"pb485">485]called sullaponnu, to her home, and pays the
money to one of several elders who are brought together. Towards
evening, the ground in front of the girl&rsquo;s hut is swept, and a
wooden plank and stone are set side by side. The bridegroom sits on the
former, and the bride on the latter. Two pots of water are placed
before them, and connected together by a thread tied round their necks.
The pots are lifted up, and the water is poured over them. Contrary to
the custom prevailing among many castes, new cloths are not given to
them after this bath. Resuming their seats, the couple sprinkle each
other with rice. An intelligent member of the caste then personates a
Br&#257;hman priest, mutters sundry mantrams (prayers), and shows a
string (karugu) with a piece of turmeric tied to it to those assembled.
It is touched by them in token of a blessing, and tied by the
bridegroom on the neck of the bride. A feast, with a liberal supply of
liquor, is held, the expenses of which are met from the ten rupees
already referred to. The younger brother may marry the widow of an
elder brother, and vice vers&acirc;. A widow is married in front
of her mother&rsquo;s hut. The marriage string is tied round her neck,
but without the ceremonial observed at the marriage of a maid. If a
husband wishes to secure a divorce, he asks his wife to break a twig in
two before a caste council. If a woman wishes for a divorce, she elopes
with a man, who pays a small fine, called ponnu, to the husband, and
asks him to break a twig.
The following story is current among the Koramas, to account for the
t&#257;li or bottu being replaced by a string of black beads. Once upon
a time, a bridegroom forgot to bring the t&#257;li, and he was told off
to procure the necessary piece of gold from a goldsmith. The parties
waited and waited, but the young man did not return. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb486" href="#pb486" name=
"pb486">486]Since then, the string of beads has been used as
a marriage badge. According to another story, the t&#257;li was
prepared, and kept on the bank of a river, but disappeared when it was
going to be picked up. A man was sent to procure another, but did not
come back.
I am informed that the Yerukalas of the Kistna district are divided
into two classes&mdash;sheep and goats practically. Of these, the
latter are the bastard offspring of the former. Illegitimate must, in
the first instance, marry illegitimate. The offspring thereof is
ipso facto whitewashed, and becomes legitimate, and must marry a
legitimate.
A custom is stated by Dr. Shortt<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6740src"
href="#xd21e6740" name="xd21e6740src">219 to prevail among the
Yerukalas, by which the first two daughters of a family may be claimed
by the maternal uncle as wives for his sons. &ldquo;The value of a wife
is fixed at twenty pagodas. The maternal uncle&rsquo;s right to the
first two daughters is valued at eight out of twenty pagodas, and is
carried out thus. If he urges his preferential claim, and marries his
own sons to his nieces, he pays for each only twelve pagodas; and
similarly if he, from not having sons, or any other cause, foregoes his
claim, he receives eight pagodas of the twenty paid to the girl&rsquo;s
parents by anybody else who may marry them.&rdquo; The price of a wife
apparently differs in different localities. For example, it is noted,
in the Census report, 1901, that, among the Kongu sub-division of the
Koravas, a man can marry his sister&rsquo;s daughter, and, when he
gives his sister in marriage, he expects her to produce a bride for
him. His sister&rsquo;s husband accordingly pays Rs. 7&ndash;8&ndash;0
out of the Rs. 60 of which the bride price consists, at the wedding
itself, and Rs. 2&ndash;8&ndash;0 more each year <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487]until the woman bears a daughter. Some Koravas
seem to be even more previous than fathers who enter their infant sons
for a popular house at a public school. For their children are said to
be espoused even before they are born. Two men, who wish their children
to marry, say to one another: &ldquo;If your wife should have a girl
and mine a boy (or vice vers&acirc;), they must marry.&rdquo;
And, to bind themselves to this, they exchange tobacco, and the
potential bridegroom&rsquo;s father stands a drink to the future
bride&rsquo;s relations. But if, after the children are grown up, a
Br&#257;hman should pronounce the omens unpropitious, the marriage does
not take place, and the bride&rsquo;s father pays back the cost of the
liquor consumed at the betrothal. If the marriage is arranged, a pot of
water is placed before the couple, and a grass (Cynodon
Dactylon) put into the water. This is equal to a binding oath
between them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6751src" href="#xd21e6751"
name="xd21e6751src">220 Of this grass it is said in the Atharwana
V&#275;da: &ldquo;May this grass, which rose from the water of life,
which has a hundred roots and a hundred stems, efface a hundred of my
sins, and prolong my existence on earth for a hundred years.&rdquo; It
is noted by the Rev. J. Cain<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6755src" href=
"#xd21e6755" name="xd21e6755src">221 that &ldquo;at the birth of a
daughter, the father of an unmarried little boy often brings a rupee,
and ties it in the cloth of the father of the newly born girl. When the
girl is grown up, he can claim her for his son. For twenty-five rupees
he can claim her much earlier.&rdquo;
In North Arcot, the Koravas are said<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6760src" href="#xd21e6760" name="xd21e6760src">222 to
&ldquo;mortgage their unmarried daughters, who become the absolute
property of the mortgagee till the debt is discharged. The same
practice exists in Chingleput and Tanjore. In Madras, the Koravars sell
their wives outright when [<a id="pb488" href=
"#pb488" name="pb488">488]they want money, for a sum equal
to fifty rupees. In Nellore and other districts, they all purchase
their wives, the price varying from thirty to seventy rupees, but money
rarely passes on such occasions, the consideration being paid in asses
or cattle.&rdquo; In a recent case in the Madras High Court, a Korava
stated that he had sold one of his wives for twenty-one
rupees.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6765src" href="#xd21e6765" name=
"xd21e6765src">223 It is stated by Dr. Pope that the Koravas do not
&ldquo;scruple to pawn their wives for debt. If the wife who is in
pledge dies a natural death, the debt is discharged. If she should die
from hard usage, the creditor must not only cancel the debt, but must
defray the expenses of a second marriage for his debtor. If the woman
lives till the debt is discharged, and if she has children by the
creditor, the boys remain with him, the girls go back with her to her
husband.&rdquo; The conditions of the country suggest a reason for the
pawning of wives. A wife would be pawned in times of stress, and
redeemed after seasons of plenty. The man who can afford to accept her
in pledge in a time of famine would, in periods of plenty, require men
for agricultural purposes. He, therefore, retains the male issue, who
in time will be useful to him. Some years ago, some Koravas were
convicted of stealing the despatch-box of the Collector of a certain
district from his tent. It came out, in the course of the trial, that
the head of the gang had taken the money contained therein as his
share, and with it acquired a wife. The Collector humorously claimed
that the woman, having been obtained with his money, was, according to
a section of the Criminal Procedure Code, his property.
A woman who marries seven men successively one after the other,
either after the death of her husbands or [<a id=
"pb489" href="#pb489" name="pb489">489]after divorce, is
said by Mr. Paupa Rao Naidu to be considered to be a respectable lady,
and is called Pedda B&#333;yis&#257;ni. She takes the lead in marriages
and other religious ceremonies.
It is noted, in the Census Report, 1891, that &ldquo;if a man is
sent to jail, his wife will form a connection with some other man of
the gang, but on the release of her husband, she will return to him
with any children born to her in the interval. The Korava women are
accustomed to honour their lords and husbands with the dignified title
of cocks.&rdquo; On one occasion, a Korava got into trouble in company
with a friend, and was sentenced to three years imprisonment, while his
friend got two years. The latter, at the termination of his period of
enforced seclusion, proceeded to live with the wife of the former,
settling down in his friend&rsquo;s abode. The former escaped from
jail, and, turning up at his home, claimed his wife. His friend
journeyed to the place where the jail was located, and reported to the
authorities his ability to find the escaped convict, who was
recaptured, while his friend regained possession of his wife, and
pocketed twenty-five rupees for giving the information which led to his
rearrest.
The remarriage of widows is permitted. The man who wishes to marry a
widow purchases new cloths for himself and his bride. He invites a
number of friends, and, in their presence, presents his bride with the
cloths. The simple ceremony is known as ch&#299;rakattu-k&#333;radam,
or desiring the cloth-tying ceremony.
As a general rule, the Korava wife is faithful to her husband, but,
in the event of incompatibility, man and wife will announce their
intention of separating to their gang. This is considered equivalent to
a divorce, and the husband can demand back the four annas, which
[<a id="pb490" href="#pb490" name=
"pb490">490]were paid as earnest money to his wife&rsquo;s
maternal uncle. This is said to be done, whether the separation is due
to the fault either of the husband or the wife. Among other castes, the
woman has to return the money only if she is divorced owing to her own
fault. Divorce is said to be rare, and, even after it has taken place,
the divorced parties may make up their differences, and continue to
keep house together. In cases of abduction, the father of the girl
summons a council meeting, at which the offender is fined. A girl who
has been abducted cannot be married as a spinster, even if she was
recovered before sexual connection had taken place. The man who carried
her off should marry her, and the ceremony of widow marriage is
performed. In the event of his refusing to marry her, he is fined in
the same amount as the parents of a girl who fail to keep the contract
to marry her to a particular person. The fact of a man who abducts a
girl having a wife already would be no bar to his marrying her, as
polygamy is freely permitted. In former days, an adulterer who was
unable to pay the fine imposed was tied to a tree, and shaved by a
barber, who used the urine of the guilty woman in lieu of water.
In connection with birth ceremonies, Mr. Fawcett writes as follows.
&ldquo;Difficulty in parturition is thought to be due to an ungratified
desire of the woman before she is confined. This is generally something
to eat, but it is sometimes ungratified lust. In cases of the latter
kind, the Koravar midwife induces the woman to mention her
paramour&rsquo;s name, and, as the name is mentioned, the midwife puts
a pinch of earth into the woman&rsquo;s mouth with the idea of
accelerating delivery. The woman is confined in an outlying hut, where
she is tabu to all, with the exception of the midwife, for about ten
days. As soon as the child is born, incense is burnt in front
[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name=
"pb491">491]of this hut, and there is an offering of jaggery
(crude sugar) to the spirits of the departed elders, who are invoked in
the following words in the Korava dialect:&mdash;&lsquo;Ye spirits of
our elders! Descend on us, give us help, and increase our cattle and
wealth. Save us from the Sircar (Government), and shut the mouth of the
police. We shall worship you for ever and ever.&rsquo; The jaggery is
then distributed to all present, and the new-born infant is cleaned
with cow-dung and washed. A Brahman is sometimes consulted, but it is
the maternal uncle upon whom the responsibility falls of naming the
child. This he does on the ninth day after confinement, when the mother
and child are bathed. Having named the child, he ties a string of
thread or cotton round its waist. This string signifies the entry of
the child into the Koravar community, and it, or its substitute, is
worn until the termination of married life. The name given on this
occasion is not usually the name by which an individual is known by his
fellows, as persons are generally called after some physical trait or
characteristic thus:&mdash;Nallav&#257;du, black man; Pottig&#257;du,
short man; Nettakal&#257;du, long-legged man; Kunt&#257;du, lame man;
Boggag&#257;du, fat man; Juttuv&#257;du, man with a large tuft of hair;
Gunadu, hunch-backed man; Mugadu, dumb man; and so on. In a few cases,
children are genuinely named after the household deities. Those so
named are called R&#257;mudu, Lachig&#257;du, Venkatig&#257;du,
Gengadu, Chengadu, Subbadu, Ankalig&#257;du, and so on. An old custom
was to brand the children on the shoulders with a piece of red-hot
iron. Marks of such branding are called the cattle mark, for it seems
that children should be branded on the shoulders before undertaking the
&lsquo;sacred duty&rsquo; of tending cattle. They explain the custom by
saying that Krishna, the God of the shepherds, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name=
"pb492">492]allowed boys of his own caste, and of no other,
to perform the sacred duty, after the boy dedicated thereto had
undergone the branding ceremony. This ceremony is seldom observed
nowadays, as it leads to identification. Birth of a child on a new-moon
night, when the weather is strong, is believed to augur a notorious
thieving future for the infant. Such children are commonly named
Venkatig&#257;du after the God at Tirupati. The birth of a child having
the umbilical cord twisted round its neck portends the death of the
father or maternal uncle. This unpleasant effect is warded off by the
uncle or the father killing a fowl, and wearing its entrails round his
neck, and afterwards burying them along with the umbilical
cord.&rdquo;
The practice of the couvade, or custom in accordance with which the
father takes to bed, and is doctored when a baby is born, is referred
to by Alberuni<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6789src" href="#xd21e6789"
name="xd21e6789src">224 (about A.D. 1030), who says that, when a
child is born, people show particular attention to the man, not to the
woman. There is a Tamil proverb that, if a Korati is brought to bed,
her husband takes the prescribed stimulant. Writing about the
Yerukalas,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6792src" href="#xd21e6792" name=
"xd21e6792src">225 the Rev. J. Cain tells us that &ldquo;directly
the woman feels the birth pains, she informs her husband, who
immediately takes some of her clothes, puts them on, places on his
forehead the mark which the women usually place on theirs, retires into
a dark room where there is only a very dim lamp, and lies down on the
bed, covering himself up with a long cloth. When the child is born, it
is washed, and placed on the cot beside the father. Asaf&oelig;tida,
jaggery, and other articles are then given, not to the mother, but to
the father. He is not allowed to leave his bed, but has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name=
"pb493">493]everything needful brought to him.&rdquo; Among
the Kuravars, or basket-makers of Malabar, &ldquo;as soon as the pains
of delivery come upon a pregnant woman, she is taken to an outlying
shed, and left alone to live or die as the event may turn out. No help
is given her for twenty-eight days. Even medicines are thrown to her
from a distance; and the only assistance rendered is to place a jar of
warm water close by her just before the child is born. Pollution from
birth is held as worse than that from death. At the end of the
twenty-eight days, the hut in which she was confined is burnt down. The
father, too, is polluted for fourteen days, and, at the end of that
time, he is purified, not like other castes by the barber, but by holy
water obtained from Br&#257;hmans at temples or elsewhere.&rdquo; To
Mr. G. Krishna Rao, Superintendent of Police in the Shimoga district of
Mysore, I am indebted for the following note on the couvade as
practiced among the Koramas. &ldquo;Mr. Rice, in the Mysore Gazetteer,
says that among the Koravars it is said that, when a woman is confined,
her husband takes medicine for her. At the instance of the British
Resident I made enquiries, and learned that the Kukke (basket-making)
Koramas, living at G&#333;p&#257;la village near Shimoga, had this
custom among them. The husband learns from his wife the probable time
of her confinement, and keeps at home awaiting the delivery. As soon as
she is confined, he goes to bed for three days, and takes medicine
consisting of chicken and mutton broth spiced with ginger, pepper,
onions, garlic, etc. He drinks arrack, and eats as good food as he can
afford, while his wife is given boiled rice with a very small quantity
of salt, for fear that a larger quantity may induce thirst. There is
generally a Korama midwife to help the wife, and the husband does
nothing but [<a id="pb494" href="#pb494" name=
"pb494">494]eat, drink, and sleep. The clothes of the
husband, the wife, and the midwife are given to a washerman to be
washed on the fourth day, and the persons themselves have a wash. After
this purification, the family gives a dinner to the caste people. One
of the men examined by me explained that the man&rsquo;s life was more
valuable than that of the woman, and that the husband, being a more
important factor in the birth than the wife, deserves to be better
looked after.&rdquo; The following legend is current among the Koramas,
to explain the practice of the couvade among them. One day a donkey,
belonging to a Korama camp, pitched outside a village, wandered into a
Br&#257;hman&rsquo;s field, and did considerable damage to the crop.
The Br&#257;hman was naturally angry, and ordered his coolies to pull
down the hut of the owner of the donkey. The Korama, casting himself at
the feet of the Br&#257;hman, for want of a better excuse, said that he
was not aware of what his animal was doing, as at the time he was
taking medicine for his wife, and could not look after it. According to
another version of the story, the Br&#257;hman ordered his servants to
remove the hut from his land or beat the Korava, so that Koravas have
since that time taken to bed and shared the pollution of their wives,
to escape being beaten.
In connection with the couvade, Mr. Fawcett writes that &ldquo;it
has been observed in the bird-catching Koravars, and the custom has
been admitted by others. Directly a woman is brought to bed, she is
given asaf&oelig;tida rolled in betel leaf. She is then given a
stimulant composed of asaf&oelig;tida and other drugs. The husband
partakes of a portion of this before it is given to the woman. This
custom is one of those which the Koravar is generally at pains to
conceal, denying its existence absolutely. The proverb &lsquo;When
[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name=
"pb495">495]the Koravar woman is confined, the Koravar man
takes asaf&oelig;tida&rsquo; is, however, well known. Very soon after a
woman is confined, attention is paid exclusively to her husband, who
wraps himself in his wife&rsquo;s cloth, and lies down in his
wife&rsquo;s place beside the new-born infant. He stays there for at
least some minutes, and then makes room for his wife. The writer of
this note was informed by Koravars that any one who refused to go
through this ceremony would undergo the severest penalties, indeed, he
would be turned out of the community. Nothing annoys a Koravar so much
as to mention the word asaf&oelig;tida in his presence, for he takes it
to be an insulting reference to the couvade. The worst insult to a
Koravar woman lies in the words &lsquo;Will you give
asaf&oelig;tida<span class="corr" id="xd21e6803" title=
"Source: &rsquo;?">?&rsquo; which are understood by her to mean
an improper overture.&rdquo;
Some Koravas are said to believe that the pangs of labour are
largely allayed by drinking small doses of a mixture of the dung of a
male donkey and water. A few years ago, when a camp of Koravas was
visited in the Salem district by the Superintendent of Police, two men
of the gang, who had petitioned for the removal of the constables who
were escorting the gang, dragged a woman in the throes of childbirth by
the armpits from the hut. This was done to show that they could not
move their camp, with a woman in such a condition. Nevertheless, long
before daylight on the following day, the camp had been moved, and they
were found at a spot fifteen miles distant. When they were asked about
the woman, a hut slightly apart from the rest was pointed out, in front
of which she was suckling the newly-born infant. She had done the
journey immediately after delivery partly on foot, and partly on a
donkey. [<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name=
"pb496">496]
The Korava child&rsquo;s technical education commences early. From
infancy, the Koravas teach their children to answer &ldquo;I do not
know&rdquo; to questions put to them. They are taught the different
methods of stealing, and the easiest way of getting into various kinds
of houses. One must be entered through the roof, another by a hole in
the wall, a third by making a hole near the bolt of the door. Before
letting himself down from a roof, the Korava must make sure that he
does not alight on brass vessels or crockery. He generally sprinkles
fine sand in small quantities, so that the noise made thereby may give
him an idea of the situation. The methods to be adopted during the day,
when hawking wares, must be learnt. When a child is caught red-handed,
he will never reveal his identity by giving the name of his parents, or
of the gang to which he belongs. A girl about twelve or thirteen years
old was captured a few years ago in the Mysore State at the Oregam
weekly market, and, on being searched, was found to have a small knife
in her cheek. She declared that she was an orphan with neither friends
nor relations, but was identified by the police. The Koravas are adepts
at assuming aliases. But the system of finger-print records,
which has been introduced in recent years, renders the concealment of
their identity more difficult than it used to be. &ldquo;Both men and
women,&rdquo; Mr. Paupa Rao writes, &ldquo;have tattoo marks on their
foreheads and forearms. When they are once convicted, they enlarge or
alter in some way the tattoo marks on their forearms, so that they
might differ from the previous descriptive marks of identification
entered by the police in their search books and other records. During
festivals, they put red stuff (kunkuma) over the tattoo marks on their
foreheads.&rdquo; [<a id="pb497" href="#pb497"
name="pb497">497]
Their conduct is regulated by certain well-defined rules. They
should not enter a house by the front door, unless this is unavoidable,
and, if they must so enter it, they must not leave by the same way. If
they enter by the back door, they depart by the front door, which they
leave wide open. They should not commit robbery in a house, in which
they have partaken of rice and curds. Curds always require salt, and
eating salt is equivalent to taking the oath of fealty according to
their code of honour. They ease themselves in the house in which they
have committed a theft, in order, it is said, to render the pursuit of
them unsuccessful.
In a note on the initiation of Yerukala girls into the profession of
fortune-telling in Vizagapatam, Mr. Hayavadana Rao writes that it is
carried out on a Sunday succeeding the first puberty ceremony. A caste
feast, with plenty of strong drink, is held, but the girl herself
fasts. The feast over, she is taken to a spot at a little distance from
the settlement called Yerukonda. This is said to be the name of a place
on the trunk road between Vizianagram and Chicacole, to which girls
were taken in former times to be initiated. The girl is blindfolded
with a cloth. Boiled rice and green gram are mixed with the blood of a
black fowl, black pig, and black goat, which are killed. Of this
mixture she must take at least three morsels, and, if she does not
vomit, it is taken as a sign that she will become a good Yeruka or
fortune-teller. Vomiting would indicate that she would be a false
prophetess.
When a wandering Korava dies, he is buried as quickly as possible,
with head to the north, and feet to the south. If possible, a new cloth
is obtained to wrap the corpse in. The grave is covered with the last
hut which the deceased occupied. The Koravas immediately <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb498" href="#pb498" name=
"pb498">498]leave a camp, in which a death has occurred. The
nomad Koravas are said by Dr. Pope to bury their dead at night, no one
knows where. Thence originates the common saying in regard to anything
which has vanished, leaving no trace behind, that it has gone to the
dancing-room of the wandering actors. Another proverb runs to the
effect that no one has seen a dead monkey, or the burning-ground of a
Korava.
In Vizagapatam, the Yerukala dead are stated by Mr. Hayavadana Rao
to be burnt in a state of nudity. A tulsi plant (Ocimum sanctum)
is usually planted on the spot where the corpse was burnt. The
relations cannot follow their regular occupation until a caste feast
has been held, and some cooked food thrown on the spot where cremation
took place.
In a note on the death rites of the Koravas of the southern
districts, Mr. F. A. Hamilton writes that, when one of the community
dies, the news of the death is conveyed by a Paraiyan or Chakkiliyan.
At the burning-ground, whither the corpse is accompanied with music, it
is laid on dried cow-dung, which has been spread on the ground. The son
of the deceased goes thrice round the corpse, and breaks a new
water-pot which he has brought with him near the head. He also hands
over a piece of burning sandalwood for lighting the pyre, and goes
straight home without seeing the corpse again. On the third day, the
son and other relations go to the burning-ground, heap up the ashes,
plant either tulsi (Ocimum sanctum), p&#275;randai (Vitis
quadrangularis), or kathalai (Agave Americana), and pour
milk. On the sixteenth day, or at some later time, a ceremony called
karumathi is performed. The relatives assemble at the burning-ground,
and a stone is set up, and washed with water, honey, milk, etc. On the
following [<a id="pb499" href="#pb499" name=
"pb499">499]day, all the relatives take an oil-bath, and new
cloths are presented to the host. Sheep are killed, and a feast, with a
liberal supply of liquor, is held. Till this ceremony is performed, the
son remains in mourning.
Concerning death ceremonies, Mr. Fawcett writes as follows. &ldquo;A
Tamil proverb likens the death of a Koravar to that of a monkey, for no
one ever sees the dead body of either. Just as the monkey is thought to
be immortal, the other monkeys removing the carcass instantly, so the
corpse of the Koravar is made away with and disposed of with all
possible speed. There is very little wailing, and preparations are made
at once. If the deceased was married, the bier on which he is carried
is practically a ladder; if unmarried, it is a single bamboo with
pieces of stick placed transversely. The winding-sheet is always a
piece of new cloth, in one corner of which is tied a half anna-piece
(which is afterwards taken by one of the corpse-bearers). Only two of
these are under pollution, which lasts the whole of the day, during
which they must remain in their huts. Next day, after bathing, they
give the crows food and milk. A line is drawn on the body from head to
foot with milk, the thick end of a piece of grass being used as a
brush; then they bathe. Pollution of the chief mourner lasts for five
days. Half-yearly and annual ceremonies to the deceased are compulsory.
A figure of the deceased is drawn with charcoal on a piece of new cloth
spread on the floor of the hut. On either side of the figure is placed
cooked rice and vegetables served on castor leaves. After some time,
the food is placed on a new winnow, which is hung suspended from the
roof of the hut the whole night. Next morning, the relations assemble,
and partake of the food.&rdquo; [<a id="pb500"

From a note on the Yerukalas of the Nellore district, I gather that,
as a rule, the dead are buried, though respected elders of the
community are cremated. Married individuals are carried to the grave on
a bier, those who die unmarried wrapped in a mat. On the second day,
some cooked food, and a fowl, are placed near the grave, to be eaten by
crows. A pot of water is carried thrice round the grave, and then
thrown down. On the ninth day, food is once more offered for the crows.
The final death ceremonies are generally performed after two or three
months. Cooked food, onions, brinjals (fruits of Solanum
Melongena), Phaseolus pulse, squash gourd (Cucurbita
maxima), pork, and mutton are placed on a number of castor
(Ricinus) leaves spread on the floor, and offered to the soul of
the deceased, which is represented by a human figure drawn on a new
cloth. At the conclusion of the worship, the food is placed on new
winnowing trays provided for the purpose, and given to the relations,
who place the winnows on the roof of the house till the following day,
when the food is eaten.
By some Koravas, a ceremony in honour of the departed ancestors is
performed at the time of the November new moon. A well-polished brass
vessel, with red and white marks on it, is placed in the corner of a
room, which has previously been swept, and purified with cow-dung. In
front of the pot is placed a leaf plate, on which cooked rice and other
edibles are set. Incense is burned, and the eldest son of the house
partakes of the food in the hope that he, in due course, will be
honoured by his offspring.
The Koramas of Mysore are said to experience considerable difficulty
in finding men to undertake the work of carrying the corpse to the
grave. Should the dead Korama be a man who has left a young widow, it
is [<a id="pb501" href="#pb501" name=
"pb501">501]customary for some one to propose to marry her
the same day, and, by so doing, to engage to carry out the principal
part of the work connected with the burial. A shallow grave, barely two
feet deep, is dug, and the corpse laid therein. When the soil has been
loosely piled in, a pot of fire, carried by the chief mourner in a
split bamboo, is broken, and a pot of water placed on the raised mound.
Should the spot be visited during the night by a pack of jackals, and
the water drunk by them to slake their thirst after feasting on the
dead Korama, the omen is accepted as proof that the liberated spirit
has fled away to the realms of the dead, and will never trouble man,
woman, child, or cattle. On the sixth day, the chief mourner must kill
a fowl, and mix its blood with rice. This he places, with some betel
leaves and nuts, near the grave. If it is carried off by crows,
everything is considered to have been settled satisfactorily.
As regards the dress of the Koravas, Mr. Mullaly writes as follows.
&ldquo;The women wear necklaces of shells and cowries interspersed with
beads of all colours in several rows, hanging low down on the bosom;
brass bangles from the wrist to the elbow; brass, lead, and silver
rings, very roughly made, on all their fingers except the middle one.
The cloth peculiar to Koravar women is a coarse black one; but they
are, as a rule, not particular as to this, and wear stolen cloths after
removing the borders and all marks of identification. They also wear
the chola, which is fastened across the bosom, and not, like the
Lamb&#257;dis, at the back. The men are dirty, unkempt-looking objects,
wear their hair long, and usually tied in a knot on the top of the
head, and indulge in little finery. A joochi (gochi), or cloth round
the loins, and a bag called vadi sanchi, made of striped cloth,
complete their toilet.&rdquo; [<a id="pb502"
href="#pb502" name="pb502">502]
In 1884, Mr. Stevenson, who was then the District Superintendent of
Police, North Arcot, devised a scheme for the regeneration of the
Koravas of that district. He obtained for the tribe a tract of
Government land near Gudiyattam, free of assessment for ten years, and
also a grant of Rs. 200 for sinking wells. Licenses were also issued to
the settlers to cut firewood at specially favourable rates. He also
prevailed upon the Zemindar of Karvetnegar to grant twenty-five cawnies
of land in Tiruttani for ten years for another settlement, as well as
some building materials. Unfortunately the impecunious condition of the
Zemindar precluded the Tiruttani settlement from deriving any further
privileges which were necessary to keep the colony going, and its
existence was, therefore, cut short. The Gudiyattam colony, on the
other hand, exhibited some vitality for two or three years, but, in
1887, it, too, went the way of the Tiruttani colony.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e6870src" href="#xd21e6870" name=
"xd21e6870src">226 I gather, from the Police Administration Report,
1906, that a scheme is being worked out, the object of which is to give
a well-known wandering criminal gang some cultivable land, and so
enable the members of it to settle down to an honest livelihood.
At the census, 1891, Korava was returned as a sub-division of
Paraiyans, and the name is also applied to J&#333;gis employed as
scavengers.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e6875src" href="#xd21e6875" name=

The following note on the Koravas of the west coast is interesting
as showing that Malabar is one of the homes of the now popular game of
Diavolo, which has become epidemic in some European countries.
&ldquo;In Malabar, there is a class of people called Koravas, who
[<a id="pb503" href="#pb503" name=
"pb503">503]have, from time immemorial, played this game
almost in the same manner as its Western devotees do at the present
time. These people are met with mostly in the southern parts of
Malabar, Cochin and Travancore, and they speak the Malay&#257;lam
language with a sing-song accent, which easily distinguishes them from
other people. They are of wandering habits. The men are clever acrobats
and rope-dancers, but those of more settled habits are engaged in
agriculture and other industries. The beautiful grass mats, known as
Palghat mats, are woven by these people. Their women are
fortune-tellers and ballad singers. Their services are also in demand
for boring the ears of girls. The ropedancers perform many wonderful
feats while balancing themselves on the rope, among them being the
playing of diabolo while walking to and fro on a tight rope. The Korava
acrobat spins the wooden spool on a string, attached to the ends of two
bamboo sticks, and throws it up to the height of a cocoanut tree, and,
when it comes down, he receives it on the string, to be again thrown
up. There are experts among them who can receive the spool on the
string without even looking at it. There is no noteworthy difference in
the structure and shape of the spool used by the Koravas, and those of
Europe, except that the Malabar apparatus is a solid wooden thing a
little larger and heavier than the Western toy. It has not yet emerged
from the crude stage of the village carpenter&rsquo;s skill, and cannot
boast of rubber tyres and other embellishments which adorn the imported
article; but it is heavy enough to cause a nasty injury should it hit
the performer while falling. The Koravas are a very primitive people,
but as acrobats and ropedancers they have continued their profession
for generations past, and there is no doubt that they have <span class=
"pagenum">[504]been
expert diabolo players for many years.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e6884src" href="#xd21e6884" name="xd21e6884src">228 It may be
noted that Lieutenant Cameron, when journeying from Zanzibar to
Benguela, was detained near Lake Tanganyika by a native chief. He
relates as follows. &ldquo;Sometimes a slave of Djonmah would amuse us
by his dexterity. With two sticks about a foot long connected by a
string of a certain length, he spun a piece of wood cut in the shape of
an hour-glass, throwing it before and behind him, pitching it up into
the air like a cricket-ball, and catching it again, while it continued
to spin.&rdquo;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
