<h2>
<span class="smaller">PREFACE</span>
<span class="x-small">TO THE SECOND EDITION</span>
</h2>

<p>The course of events since 1906, when the second
volume of this work first made its appearance, and
the results of further research have necessitated, as in
the case of the first volume, the thorough revision of
the text, the rewriting of many portions, and the
discussion of a number of new topics. The additions
to this volume are even more numerous than those to
the first, with the consequence that, in spite of the
typographical devices explained in the preface to the
second edition of the first volume, the text of this
volume has been increased by one hundred pages. The
increase is, in some measure, due to the fact that
the thirteen Conventions of the Second Hague Peace
Conference, and, further, the Declaration of London,
are fully discussed and expounded. But the increase
is also due to the fact that a number of other new topics
have been discussed; I will only mention the questions
whether enemy subjects have <i>persona standi in judicio</i>
(§ <a href="#Formerly_the_rule100a">100<i>a</i></a>), and whether trading with enemy subjects is
permitted (§ <a href="#Following101">101</a>).</p>

<p>The system of the work, with but occasional slight
alterations in arrangement and the headings of the
sections, remains the same. In those cases, however,
in which a portion had to be entirely rewritten&mdash;as, for
instance, that on Enemy Character, that on Commencement
of War, and that on Unneutral Service&mdash;the
arrangement of the topics differs from that in the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>edition, and the headings of the sections also differ.
Apart from many new sections, a whole chapter treating
of the proposed International Prize Court has been
added at the end of the volume.</p>

<p>Since some of the Conventions produced by the
Second Peace Conference, and, further, the Declaration
of London, have not yet been ratified, the task of the
writer of a comprehensive treatise on International
Law is very difficult: he must certainly not treat
the rules in these unratified documents as law, but,
on the other hand, he must not ignore them. For
this reason the right method seemed to be to give
everywhere the law hitherto prevailing, and to give
also the changes in the law which are proposed by these
unratified documents. I venture to hope that this
method will enable the reader to form a judgment of his
own with regard to the merits of the Declaration of
London. I have not concealed my conviction that the
ratification of this Declaration would mark great progress
in the development of International Law, since it
offers a common agreement upon a number of subjects
concerning which there has been hitherto much discord
both in theory and practice. But I have endeavoured
to put the matter impartially before the reader, and
I have taken special care to draw attention to very
numerous points which have not been settled by the
Declaration of London.</p>

<p>In revising and rewriting this volume I have remained
true to the principle of impartiality, neither
taking the part of any one nation, nor denouncing any
other. The discredit which International Law concerning
War and Neutrality suffers in the minds of certain
sections of the public is largely due to the fact that
many writers have not in the past approached the
subject with that impartial and truly international
spirit which is indispensable for its proper treatment.</p>

<p>Many friends of the book have asked that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
second edition might, in the Appendix, offer an English
translation of the French texts concerned. I was prepared
to accede to their request, but had to abstain
from doing so on account of the fact that the addition
of a translation would have made the volume too
bulky for convenience; the new Conventions of the
Second Hague Peace Conference, the Declaration of
London together with the Report of the Drafting
Committee of the Naval Conference of London, the
Naval Prize Bill of 1911, and the Geneva Convention
Act of 1911, all of which necessarily had to be added,
having increased the Appendix very considerably.</p>

<p>It has been the aim of my assistants and myself
to make the quotations in this and the preceding
volume as correct as possible. However, considering
that there are many thousands of citations, it would
be a miracle if there were not numerous mistakes and
misprints in them, in spite of the great care which
has been bestowed upon the matter. I shall be most
grateful, therefore, if readers will kindly draw my
attention to any inaccuracy they may notice.</p>

<p>My thanks are once more due to reviewers and
readers who have drawn my attention to mistakes and
misprints in the first edition; and I am again indebted
to Miss B. M. Rutter and Mr. C. F. Pond for their
valuable assistance in reading the proofs and in drawing
up the Table of Cases and the alphabetical Index.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Legal and

International
Differences.</p></div>

<p>§ 1. International differences can arise from a
variety of grounds. Between the extremes of a simple
and comparatively unimportant act of discourtesy
committed by one State against another, on the one
hand, and, on the other, so gross an insult as must
necessarily lead to war, there are many other grounds
varying in nature and importance. State differences
are correctly divided into legal and political. Legal
differences arise from acts for which States have to
bear responsibility, be it acts of their own or of their
Parliaments, judicial and administrative officials, armed
forces, or individuals living on their territory.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Political
differences are the result of a conflict of political interests.
But although this distinction is certainly
theoretically correct and of practical importance, frequently
in practice a sharp line cannot be drawn. For
in many cases States either hide their political interests
behind a claim for an alleged injury, or make a positive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
but comparatively insignificant, injury a pretext for
the carrying out of political ends. Nations which
have been for years facing each other armed to the
teeth, waiting for a convenient moment to engage in
hostilities, are only too ready to obliterate the boundary
line between legal and political differences. Between
such nations a condition of continuous friction prevails
which makes it difficult, if not impossible, in every
case which arises to distinguish the legal from the
political character of the difference.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See
 above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#No149">vol. I. § 149</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>International
Law not
exclusively
concerned
with
Legal Differences.</p></div>

<p>§ 2. It is often maintained that the Law of Nations
is concerned with legal differences only, political
differences being a matter not of law but of politics.
Now it is certainly true that only legal differences can
be settled by a juristic decision of the underlying
juristic question, whatever may be the way in which
such decision is arrived at. But although political
differences cannot be the objects of juristic decision,
they can be settled short of war by amicable or compulsive
means. And legal differences, although within
the scope of juristic decision, can be of such kinds as
to prevent the parties from submitting them to such
decision, without being of a nature that they cannot
be settled peaceably at all. Moreover, although the
distinction between legal and political differences is
certainly correct in theory and of importance in practice,
nevertheless, in practice, a sharp line frequently cannot
be drawn, as has just been pointed out. Therefore the
Law of Nations is not exclusively concerned with legal
differences, for in fact all amicable means of settling
legal differences are likewise means of settling political
differences, and so are two of the compulsive means of
settling differences&mdash;namely, pacific blockade and intervention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Amicable
in contradistinction to compulsive settlement of Differences.</p></div>

<p>§ 3. <a name="Political_and_legal3" id="Political_and_legal3"></a>Political and legal differences can be settled
either by amicable or by compulsive means. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
are four kinds of amicable means&mdash;namely, negotiation
between the parties, good offices of third parties,
mediation, and arbitration.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And there are also four
kinds of compulsive means&mdash;namely, retorsion, reprisals
(including embargo), blockade, and intervention
of third States. No State is allowed to make use
of compulsive means before negotiation has been tried,
but there is no necessity for the good offices or mediation
of third States, and eventually arbitration,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to be
tried beforehand also. Frequently, however, States
nowadays make use of the so-called Compromise Clause<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
in their treaties, stipulating thereby that any differences
arising between the contracting parties with regard to
matters regulated by, or to the interpretation of, the
respective treaties shall be settled through the amicable
means of arbitration to the exclusion of all
compulsive means. And there are even a few examples
of States which have concluded treaties stipulating
that all differences, without exception, that might
arise between them should be amicably settled by
arbitration.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> These exceptions, however, only confirm
the rule that no international legal duty exists for
States to settle their differences amicably through
arbitration, or even to try to settle them in this way,
before they make use of compulsive means.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Some writers (see
 Hall, § 118, and Heilborn, <i>System</i>, p.
404) refuse to treat negotiation, good offices, and mediation as means
of settling differences, because they cannot find that these means are
of any legal value, it being in the choice of the parties whether or not
they agree to make use of them. They forget, however, the enormous
political value of these means, which alone well justifies their
treatment; moreover, there are already some positive legal rules in
existence concerning these means&mdash;see Hague Arbitration Treaty, articles
2-7 and 9-36&mdash;and others will in time, no doubt, be established.</p></div>

<p>§ 4. <a name="Th4" id="Th4"></a>The simplest means of settling State differences,
and that to which States always resort before
they make use of other means, is negotiation. It
consists in such acts of intercourse between the parties
as are initiated and directed for the purpose of effecting
an understanding and thereby amicably settling the
difference that has arisen between them.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Negotiation
as a rule begins by a State complaining of a certain
act, or lodging a certain claim with another State.
The next step is a statement from the latter making
out its case, which is handed over to the former. It
may be that the parties come at once to an understanding
through this simple exchange of statements.
If not, other acts may follow according to the requirements
of the special case. Thus, for instance, other
statements may be exchanged, or a conference of
diplomatic envoys, or even of the heads of the States at
variance, may be arranged for the purpose of discussing
the differences and preparing the basis for an understanding.</p>

<p>§ 5. <a name="Th5" id="Th5"></a>The contracting Powers of the Hague Convention
for the peaceful settlement of international differences
deem it expedient and desirable that, if the
ordinary diplomatic negotiation has failed to settle
such differences as do not involve either honour or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>vital interests, the parties should, so far as circumstances allow, institute an International Commission
of Inquiry<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> for the purpose of elucidating the facts
underlying the difference by an impartial and conscientious
investigation. The Convention of 1899 had
only six articles (9-14) on the subject. The Second
Conference of 1907, profiting by the experience gained
by the Commission of Inquiry in the Dogger Bank<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
case, the first and as yet only occasion on which a
Commission of Inquiry was instituted, remodelled the
institution, and Convention I. treats of the subject in
twenty-eight articles (9-36). The more important
stipulations are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The Commissions are to be constituted by a
special treaty of the parties, which is to determine the
facts to be examined, the manner and period within
which the Commission is to be formed, the extent of the
powers of the Commissioners, the place where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Commission is to meet and whether it may remove to
another place, the languages to be used by the Commission
and parties, and the like (articles 9-10). If the
treaty does not determine the place where the Commission
is to sit, it shall sit at the Hague; if the
treaty does not specify the languages to be used, the
question shall be decided by the Commission; and if
the treaty does not stipulate the manner in which
the Commission is to be formed, it shall be formed
in the manner determined by articles 45 and 57
of Convention I. (articles 11-12). The parties may
appoint Assessors, Agents, and Counsel (articles 10,
13, 14).</p>

<p>(2) The International Bureau of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration acts as Registry for the Commissions
which sit at the Hague; but if they sit elsewhere,
a Secretary-General is to be appointed whose
office serves as Registry (articles 15-16).</p>

<p>(3) The parties may agree upon the rules of procedure
to be followed by the Commission, but if they do not
provide such rules themselves, the rules of procedure,
comprised in articles 19-32 are applicable (article 17),
and, in any case, the Commission is to settle such
details of the procedure as are either not covered by the
treaty of the parties or by articles 19-32, and is to
arrange all the formalities required for dealing with the
evidence (article 18).</p>

<p>(4) The Report of the Commission is to be signed by
all its members; but if a member refuses to sign, the
fact is to be mentioned, and the validity of the Report
is not thereby affected (article 33). The Report of the
Commission is read in open Court, the Agents and Counsel
of the parties being present or duly summoned to
attend; a copy of the Report is furnished to each
party (article 34). This Report is absolutely limited
to a statement of the facts, it has in no way the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of an Arbitral Award, and it leaves to the parties entire
freedom as to the effect to be given to the statement
of the facts (article 35).</p>

<p>(5) Each party pays its own expenses and an equal
share of the expenses of the Commission (article 36).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> On October 24, 1904, during the Russo-Japanese war, the
Russian Baltic fleet, which was on its way to the Far East, fired into
the Hull fishing fleet off the Dogger Bank, in the North Sea, whereby
two fishermen were killed and considerable damage was done to several
trawlers. Great Britain demanded from Russia not only an apology and
ample damages, but also severe punishment of the officer responsible for
the outrage. As Russia maintained that the firing was caused by the
approach of some Japanese torpedo-boats, and that she could therefore
not punish the officer in command, the parties agreed upon the
establishment of an International Commission of Inquiry, which, however,
was charged not only to ascertain the facts of the incident but also to
pronounce an opinion concerning the responsibility for the incident and
the degree of blame attaching to the responsible persons. The Commission
consisted of five naval officers of high rank&mdash;namely, one British, one
Russian, one American, one French, and one Austrian, who sat at Paris in
February 1905. The report of the Commission states that no torpedo-boats
had been present, that the opening of fire on the part of the Baltic
fleet was not justifiable, that Admiral Rojdestvensky, the commander of
the Baltic fleet, was responsible for the incident, but that these facts
were "not of a nature to cast any discredit upon the military qualities
or the humanity of Admiral Rojdestvensky or of the <i>personnel</i> of his
squadron." In consequence of the last part of this report Great Britain
could not insist upon any punishment to be meted out to the responsible
Russian Admiral, but Russia paid a sum of £65,000 to indemnify the
victims of the incident and the families of the two dead fishermen. See
Martens, <i>N.R.G.</i> 2nd Ser. XXXIII. (1906), pp. 641-716, And Mandelstam

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of
Negotiation.</p></div>

<p>§ 6. The effect of negotiation can be to make it
apparent that the parties cannot come to an amicable
understanding at all. But frequently the effect is that
one of the parties acknowledges the claim of the other
party. Again, sometimes negotiation results in a
party, although it does not acknowledge the opponent's
alleged rights, waiving its own rights for the sake of
peace and for the purpose of making friends with the
opponent. And, lastly, the effect of negotiation can
be a compromise between the parties. Frequently the
parties, after having come to an understanding, conclude
a treaty in which they embody the terms of the
understanding arrived at through negotiation. The
practice of everyday life shows clearly the great importance
of negotiation as a means of settling international
differences. The modern development of
international traffic and transport, the fact that individuals
are constantly travelling on foreign territories, the
keen interest taken by all powerful States in colonial
enterprise, and many other factors, make the daily rise
of differences between States unavoidable. Yet the
greater number of such differences are settled through
negotiation of some kind or other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Occasions
for Good
Offices
and Mediation.</p></div>

<p>§ 7. When parties are not inclined to settle their
differences by negotiation, or when they have negotiated
without effecting an understanding, a third
State can procure a settlement through its good
offices or its mediation, whether only one or both
parties have asked for the help of the third State or
the latter has spontaneously offered it. There is also
possible a collective mediation, several States acting
at the same time as mediators. It is further possible
for a mediatorial Conference or Congress to meet
for the purpose of discussing the terms of an understanding
between the conflicting parties. And it
must be especially mentioned that good offices and
mediation are not confined to the time before the
differing parties have appealed to arms; they can
also be offered and sought during hostilities for the
purpose of bringing the war to an end. It is during
war in particular that good offices and mediation are
of great value, neither of the belligerents as a rule
being inclined to open peace negotiations on his own
account.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Right and duty of offering, requesting, and rendering Good
Offices and Mediation.</p></div>

<p>§ 8. As a rule, no duty exists for a third State to
offer its good offices or mediation, or to respond to a
request of the conflicting States for such, nor is it,
as a rule, the duty of the conflicting parties themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to ask or to accept a third State's good offices
and mediation. But by special treaty such duty can
be stipulated. Thus, for instance, by article 8 of the
Peace Treaty of Paris of March 30, 1856, between
Austria, France, Great Britain, Prussia, Russia, Sardinia,
and Turkey, it was stipulated that, in case in
the future such difference as threatened peace should
arise between Turkey and one or more of the signatory
Powers, the parties should be obliged,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> before
resorting to arms, to ask for the mediation of the other
signatory Powers. Thus, further, article 12 of the
General Act of the Berlin Congo Conference of 1885
stipulates that, in case a serious difference should
arise between some of the signatory Powers as regards
the Congo territories, the parties should, before resorting
to arms, be obliged to ask the other signatory
Powers for their mediation. And lately the Hague
Conventions for the peaceful settlement of international
differences have laid down some stipulations respecting
the right and duty of good offices and mediation,
which will be found below in § 10.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> But Italy did not comply with this stipulation before she
declared war against Turkey in September 1911.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Good
Offices in
contradistinction
to Mediation.</p></div>

<p>§ 9. <a name="Di9" id="Di9"></a>Diplomatic practice frequently does not distinguish
between good offices and mediation. But
although good offices can easily develop into mediation,
they must not be confounded with it. The
difference between them is that, whereas good offices
consist in various kinds of action tending to call negotiations
between the conflicting States into existence,
mediation consists in a direct conduct of negotiations
between the differing parties on the basis of proposals
made by the mediator. Good offices seek to induce
the conflicting parties, who are either not at all inclined
to negotiate with each other or who have negotiated
without effecting an understanding, to enter or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
re-enter into such negotiations. Good offices can also
consist in advice, in submitting a proposal of one of
the parties to the other, and the like, but they never
take part in the negotiations themselves. On the
other hand, the mediator is the middleman who does
take part in the negotiations. He makes certain propositions
on the basis of which the States at variance
may come to an understanding. He even conducts
the negotiations himself, always anxious to reconcile
the opposing claims and to appease the feeling of resentment
between the parties. All the efforts of the
mediator may often, of course, be useless, the differing
parties being unable or unwilling to consent to an
agreement. But if an understanding is arrived at, the
position of the mediator as a party to the negotiation,
although not a participator in the difference, frequently
becomes clearly apparent either by the drafting of a
special act of mediation which is signed by the States
at variance and the mediator, or by the fact that in
the convention between the conflicting States, which
stipulates the terms of their understanding, the
mediator is mentioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Good
Offices
and Mediation
according
to the
Hague Arbitration
Convention.</p></div>

<p>§ 10. The Hague Convention for the peaceful settlement
of international differences<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> undertakes in
articles 2-8 the task of making the signatory Powers
have recourse more frequently than hitherto to
good offices and mediation; it likewise recommends
a new and particular form of mediation. Its rules
are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> See
 Meurer, I. pp. 104-128; Higgins, p. 167; Barclay,
<i>Problems</i>, pp. 191-197; Lémonon, pp. 69-73; Wehberg, <i>Kommentar</i>, pp.
10-21; Nippold, I. pp. 21-22; Scott, <i>Conferences</i>, pp. 256-265.</p></div>

<p>(1) The contracting Powers agree to have recourse,
before they appeal to arms, as far as circumstances
allow, to good offices or mediation (article 2). And
independently of this recourse, they consider it expedient
and desirable that contracting Powers who are strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to the dispute should, on their own initiative, offer their
good offices or mediation (article 3). A real legal
duty to offer good offices or mediation is not thereby
created; only the expediency and desirability of such
offer are recognised. In regard to the legal duty of conflicting
States to ask for good offices or mediation, it is
obvious that, although literally such duty is agreed
upon, the condition "as far as circumstances allow"
makes it more or less illusory, as it is in the discretion
of the parties to judge for themselves whether or not
the circumstances of the special case allow their having
recourse to good offices and mediation.</p>

<p>(2) The contracting Powers agree that (article 3) a
right to offer good offices or mediation exists for those
of them who are strangers to a dispute, and that this
right exists also after the conflicting parties have
appealed to arms. Consequently, every contracting
Power, when at variance with another, be it before or
after the outbreak of hostilities, is in duty bound to
receive an offer made for good offices or mediation,
although it need not accept such offer. And it is
especially stipulated that the exercise of the right to
offer good offices or mediation may never be regarded
by the conflicting States as an unfriendly act (article 3).
It is, further, stipulated that the contracting Powers
consider it their duty in a serious conflict to remind
the parties of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and
that the advice to have recourse to this Court may only
be considered as an exercise of good offices (article 48,
paragraphs 1 and 2). And, finally, in case of dispute
between two Powers, one of them may always address
to the International Bureau of the Permanent Court
of Arbitration a note containing a declaration that it
would be ready to submit the dispute to arbitration,
whereupon the Bureau must at once inform the other
Power of this declaration (article 48, paragraphs 3 and 4).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Mediation is defined (article 4) as reconciliation
of the opposing claims and appeasement of the
feelings of resentment between the conflicting States,
and it is specially emphasised that good offices and
mediation have exclusively the character of advice.</p>

<p>(4) The acceptance of mediation&mdash;and, of course,
of good offices, which is not mentioned&mdash;does not
(article 7) have the effect of interrupting, delaying,
or hindering mobilisation or other preparatory measures
for war, or of interrupting military operations when
war has broken out before the acceptance of mediation,
unless there should be an agreement to the contrary.</p>

<p>(5) The functions of the mediator are at an end
(article 5) when once it is stated, either by one of the
conflicting parties or by the mediator himself, that
the means of reconciliation proposed by him are not
accepted.</p>

<p>(6) A new and particular form of mediation is
recommended by article 8. Before appealing to arms
the conflicting States choose respectively a State as
umpire, to whom each intrusts the mission of entering
into direct communication with the umpire chosen by
the other side for the purpose of preventing the rupture
of pacific relations. The period of the mandate extends,
unless otherwise stipulated, to thirty days, and
during such period the conflicting States cease from all
direct communication on the matter in dispute, which
is regarded as referred exclusively to the mediating
umpires, who must use their best efforts to settle the
difference. Should such mediation not succeed in
bringing the conflicting States to an understanding, and
should, consequently, a definite rupture of pacific relations
take place, the chosen umpires are jointly charged
with the task of taking advantage of any opportunity
to restore peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Value of Good Offices and Mediation.</p></div>

<p>§ 11. The value of good offices and mediation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the amicable settlement of international conflicts, be
it before or after the parties have appealed to arms,
cannot be over-estimated. Hostilities have been frequently
prevented through the authority and the skill
of mediators, and furiously raging wars have been
brought to an end through good offices and mediation
of third States.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Nowadays the importance of these
means of settlement of international differences is even
greater than in the past. The outbreak of war is under
the circumstances and conditions of our times no longer
a matter of indifference to all except the belligerent
States, and no State which goes to war knows exactly
how far such war may affect its very existence. If
good offices and mediation are interposed at the right
moment, they will in many cases not fail to effect a
settlement of the conflict. The stipulations of the
Hague Convention for the peaceful adjustment of
differences have greatly enhanced the value of good
offices and mediation by giving a legal right to Powers,
strangers to the dispute, to offer their good offices and
mediation before and during hostilities.</p>

the important cases of mediation discussed by Calvo,
III. §§ 1684-1700, and Bonfils, Nos. 936-942. From our own days the case
of the Dogger Bank incident of 1904 may be quoted as an example, for it
was through the mediation of France that Great Britain and Russia agreed
upon the establishment of an International Commission of Inquiry.
(See <a href="#Footnote_8_8">p. 7, note 2</a>.) And the good offices of the President of the United
States of America were the means of inducing Russia and Japan, in August
1905, to open the negotiations which actually led to the conclusion of
the Peace of Portsmouth on September 5, 1905.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception
of Arbitration.</p></div>

<p>§ 12. Arbitration is the name for the determination
of differences between States through the verdict of
one or more umpires chosen by the parties. As there
is no central political authority above the Sovereign
States, and no such International Court as could
exercise jurisdiction over them, State differences, unlike
differences between private individuals, cannot as a
rule be obligatorily settled in courts of justice. The
only way in which a settlement of State differences
through a verdict may be arrived at is by the conflicting
States voluntarily consenting to submit themselves
to a verdict of one or more umpires chosen by
themselves for that purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Treaty of
Arbitration.</p></div>

<p>§ 13. It is, therefore, necessary for such conflicting
States as intend to have the conflict determined
by arbitration to conclude a treaty by which they
agree to this course. Such treaty of arbitration involves
the obligation of both parties to submit in good
faith to the decision of the arbitrators. Frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a treaty of arbitration will be concluded after the outbreak
of a difference, but it also frequently happens
that States concluding treaties stipulate therein by
the so-called Compromise Clause,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that any difference
arising between the parties respecting matters regulated
by such treaty shall be determined by arbitration. Two
or more States can also conclude a so-called general
treaty of arbitration, or treaty of permanent arbitration,
stipulating that all or certain kinds of differences
in future arising between them shall be settled by
this method. Thus article 7 of the Commercial Treaty
between Holland and Portugal<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of July 5, 1894,
contains such a general treaty of arbitration, as it
stipulates arbitration not only for differences respecting
matters of commerce, but for all kinds of differences
arising in the future between the parties, provided
these differences do not concern their independence
or autonomy. Until the Hague Peace Conference of
1899, however, general treaties of arbitration were not
numerous. But public opinion everywhere was aroused
in favour of general arbitration treaties through the
success of this conference, with the result that from
1900 to the present day many general arbitration
treaties have been concluded.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

they appoint the chosen State and by which such
State accepts the appointment. The appointed State
chooses on its own behalf those umpires who actually
serve as arbitrators. It can happen that the conflicting
States choose a head of a third State as arbitrator.
But such head never himself investigates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
matter; he chooses one or more individuals, who make
a report and propose a verdict, which he pronounces.
And, further, the conflicting States may agree to entrust
the arbitration to any other individual or to a body of
individuals, a so-called Arbitration Committee or Commission.
Thus the arbitration of 1900 in regard to the
Venezuelan Boundary Dispute between Great Britain,
Venezuela, and the United States was conducted by a
Commission, sitting at Paris, consisting of American
and English members and the Russian Professor von
Martens as President. And the Alaska Boundary
Dispute between Great Britain and the United States
was settled in 1903, through the award of a Commission,
sitting at London, consisting of American and Canadian
members, with Lord Alverstone, Lord Chief Justice of
England, as President.</p>

<p>§ 15. The treaty of arbitration must stipulate the
principles according to which the arbitrators have to
give their verdict. These principles may be the general
rules of International Law, but they may also be the rules
of any Municipal Law chosen by the conflicting States,
or rules of natural equity, or rules specially stipulated
in the treaty of arbitration for the special case.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> And
it can also happen that the treaty of arbitration
stipulates that the arbitrators shall compromise the
conflicting claims of the parties without resorting to
special rules of law. The treaty of arbitration, further,
as a rule, stipulates the procedure to be followed by
the arbitrators who are investigating and determining
the difference. If a treaty of arbitration does not
lay down rules of procedure, the arbitrators themselves
have to work out such rules and to communicate them
to the parties.</p>

<p>§ 16. <a name="An_arbitral_verdict16" id="An_arbitral_verdict16"></a>An arbitral verdict is final if the arbitration
treaty does not stipulate the contrary, and the verdict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
given by the arbitrators is binding upon the parties.
As, however, no such central authority exists above
the States as could execute the verdict against a
State refusing to submit, it is in such a case the right
of the other party to enforce the arbitral decision by
compulsion. Yet it is obvious that an arbitral verdict is
binding only under the condition<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that the arbitrators
have in every way fulfilled their duty as umpires and
have been able to find their verdict in perfect independence.
Should they have been bribed or not
followed their instructions, should their verdict have
been given under the influence of coercion of any kind,
or should one of the parties have intentionally and
maliciously led the arbitrators into an essential material
error, the arbitral verdict would have no binding force
whatever. Thus the award given in 1831 by the King
of Holland in the North-Eastern Boundary Dispute
between Great Britain and the United States of America
was not considered binding by the parties because the
arbitrator had transgressed his powers.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> For the same

<div class="sidenote"><p>What differences
can be
decided
by Arbitration.</p></div>

<p>§ 17. <a name="It_is_often17" id="It_is_often17"></a>It is often maintained that every possible
difference between States could not be determined by
arbitration, and, consequently, efforts are made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
distinguish those groups of State differences which
are determinable by arbitration from others. Now
although all States may never consent to have all
possible differences decided by arbitration, theoretically
there is no reason for a distinction between differences
decidable and undecidable through arbitration. For
there can be no doubt that, the consent of the parties
once given, every possible difference might be settled
through arbitration, either by the verdict being based
on rules of International Law, or rules of natural equity,
or by opposing claims being compromised. But, differing
from the theoretical question as to what differences
are and are not determinable by arbitration, is the
question as to what kind of State differences <i>ought</i>
always to be settled in this manner. The latter question
has been answered by article 38 (formerly 16) of
the Hague Convention for the peaceful adjustment of
international differences, the contracting Powers therein
recognising arbitration as the most efficacious, and at
the same time the most equitable, means of determining
differences of a judicial character in general, and in
especial differences regarding the interpretation or
application of international treaties. But future experience
must decide whether the signatory Powers will
in practice always act according to this distinction.</p>

<p>However this may be, when, in 1903, Great Britain
and France, following the suggestion of this article 38
(formerly 16), concluded a treaty in which they agreed
to settle by arbitration all such differences of a legal
nature as do not affect their vital interests, their independence,
or their honour, many other States followed
the lead. Great Britain, in the same and the following
years, entered into such arbitration treaties with Spain,
Italy, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland,
Austria-Hungary, Holland, Denmark, the United
States of America, Colombia, and Brazil. All these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
agreements were concluded for five years only, but
those which have since expired have all been renewed
for another period of five years.</p>

<p>Yet there is a flaw in all these treaties, because the
decision as to whether a difference is of a legal nature
or not, is left to the discretion of the parties. Cases
have happened in which one of the parties has claimed
to have a difference settled by arbitration on account
of its legal nature, whereas the other party has denied
the legal nature of the difference and, therefore, refused
to go to arbitration. For this reason the arbitration
treaties signed on August 3, 1911, between the United
States of America and Great Britain and between the
United States of America and France are epoch making,
since article 3 provides that, in cases where the parties
disagree as to whether or not a difference is subject to
arbitration under the treaty concerned, the question shall
be submitted to a joint High Commission of Inquiry;
and that, if all, or all but one, of the members of such
Commission decide the question in the affirmative, the
case shall be settled by arbitration. Article 3 has,
however, been struck out by the American Senate,
with the consequence that these treaties have lost
their intrinsic value, even should they be ratified.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that, whereas most arbitration
treaties limit arbitration in one or more ways,
exempting cases which concern the independence, the
honour, or the vital interests of the parties, Argentina<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>

American Republics of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Nicaragua, and San Salvador in 1907, Italy and
Holland in 1907 entered into general arbitration treaties
according to which all differences without any exception

<div class="sidenote"><p>Value of
Arbitration.</p></div>

<p>§ 18. There can be no doubt that arbitration is,
and every day becomes more and more, of great importance.
History proves that in antiquity and during
the Middle Ages arbitration was occasionally<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> made use
of as a peaceable means of settling international differences.
But, although an International Law made its
appearance in modern times, during the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries very few cases
of arbitration occurred. It was not until the end of
the eighteenth century that arbitration was frequently
made use of. There are 177 cases from 1794 to the
end of 1900.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This number shows that the inclination
of States to agree to arbitration has increased, and
there can be no doubt that arbitration has a great
future. States and the public opinion of the whole
world become more and more convinced that there
are a good many international differences which may
well be determined by arbitration without any danger
whatever to the national existence, independence,
dignity, and prosperity of the States concerned. A
net of so-called Peace Societies has spread over the
whole world, and their members unceasingly work for
the promotion of arbitration. The Parliaments of
several countries have repeatedly given their vote in
favour of arbitration; and the Hague Peace Conference
of 1899 created a Permanent Court of Arbitration,
a step by which a new epoch of the development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of International Law was inaugurated. It is certain that
arbitration will gradually increase its range, although
the time is by no means in sight when all international
differences will find their settlement by arbitration.</p>

<p>The novel institution of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration at the Hague stands at present in the
cross-fire of impatient pacifists and cynical pessimists.
Because a number of wars have been fought since the
establishment of the Permanent Court, impatient
pacifists are in despair and consider the institution of
the Court of Arbitration a failure, whereas cynical
pessimists triumphantly point to the fact that the
millennium would seem to be as far distant as ever.
The calm observer of the facts who possesses insight
in the process of historical development, has no cause
to despair, for, compared with some generations ago,
arbitration is an established force which daily gains
more power and influence. And when once a real
International Court<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of justice is established side by
side with the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the
chances of arbitration will be greatly increased.</p>

<p>§ 19. <a name="Of_the_97_articles19" id="Of_the_97_articles19"></a>Of the 97 articles of the Hague Convention
for the peaceful adjustment of international differences,
no fewer than 44&mdash;namely, articles 37-90&mdash;deal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
arbitration in three chapters, headed "On Arbitral
Justice," "On the Permanent Court of Arbitration,"
and "On Arbitral Procedure." The first chapter,
articles 37-40, contains rules on arbitral justice in
general, which, however, with one exception, are not
of a legal but of a merely doctrinal character. Thus the
definition in article 37, first paragraph, "International
arbitration has for its object the determination of controversies
between States by judges of their own choice
and upon the basis of respect for law," is as doctrinal as
the assertion of article 38: "In questions of a judicial
character, and especially in questions regarding the
interpretation or application of International Treaties
or Conventions, arbitration is recognised by the contracting
Powers as the most efficacious and at the same
time the most equitable method of deciding controversies
which have not been settled by diplomatic
methods. Consequently it would be desirable that,
in disputes regarding the above-mentioned questions,
the contracting Powers should, if the case arise, have
recourse to arbitration, in so far as circumstances
permit." And the provision of article 39, that an
agreement of arbitration may be made respecting
disputes already in existence or arising in the future
and may relate to every kind of controversy or solely
to controversies of a particular character, is as doctrinal
as the reservation of article 40, which runs: "Independently
of existing general or special treaties imposing
the obligation to have recourse to arbitration on the
part of any of the contracting Powers, these Powers
reserve to themselves the right to conclude, either before
the ratification of the present Convention or afterwards,
new general or special agreements with a view to extending
obligatory arbitration to all cases which they
consider possible to submit to it." The only rule of
legal character is that of article 37 (second paragraph),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
enacting the already existing customary rule of International
Law, that "the agreement of arbitration
implies the obligation to submit in good faith to the
arbitral sentence."</p>

<p>On the signatory Powers no obligation whatever
to submit any difference to arbitration is imposed.
Even differences of a judicial character, and especially
those regarding the interpretation or application of
treaties, for the settlement of which the signatory
Powers, in article 38, acknowledge arbitration as the
most efficacious and at the same time the most equitable
method, need not necessarily be submitted to
arbitration.</p>

<p>Yet the principle of compulsory arbitration for a
limited number of international differences was by no
means negatived by the Hague Peace Conferences,
especially not by the Second Conference.</p>

<p>The principle found, firstly, indirect recognition by
the Convention respecting the Limitation of the Employment
of Force for the Recovery of Contract Debts.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Since article I of this Convention stipulates that recourse
to the employment of force for the recovery of
contract debts claimed from the Government of one
country by the Government of another country as
being due to its nationals is not allowed unless the
debtor State refuses arbitration, compulsory arbitration
has in this instance been victorious.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> See
above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#It_is_apparent135">vol. I. § 135, p. 192</a>, where the so-called Drago doctrine is
likewise discussed.</p></div>

<p>Secondly, although it was not possible to agree upon
some stipulation embodying compulsory arbitration for
a number of differences in Convention I., the principle
itself was fully recognised, and the Final Act of the
Second Peace Conference includes, therefore, the Declaration
that the Conference "is unanimous (1) in
admitting the principle of compulsory arbitration;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
(2) in declaring that certain disputes, in particular
those relating to the interpretation and application
of international agreements, may be submitted to compulsory
arbitration without any restriction."</p>

<p>The above shows reasonable grounds for the hope
and expectation that one of the future Peace Conferences
will find a way out of the difficulty and come to
an agreement stipulating compulsory arbitration for a
limited number of international differences.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Arbitration
Treaty
and appointment
of Arbitrators.</p></div>

<p>§ 20. <a name="Ac20" id="Ac20"></a>According to article 52 the conflicting States
which resort to arbitration shall sign a special Act, the
<i>Compromis</i>, in which is clearly defined: the subject of
the dispute; the time allowed for appointing the
arbitrators; the form, order, and time in which the
communications referred to in article 63 of Convention I.
must be made; the amount of the sum which each
party must deposit in advance to defray the expenses;
the manner of appointing arbitrators (if there be
occasion); any special powers which may eventually
belong to the Tribunal, where it shall meet, the languages
to be used, and any special conditions upon which the
parties may agree. Should, however, the conflicting
States prefer it, the Permanent Court at the Hague is
competent to draw up and settle the <i>Compromis</i>, and
the Court is likewise in some other cases competent
to settle the <i>Compromis</i> (articles 53-54). The parties
may agree to have recourse to the Permanent Court of
Arbitration which was instituted by the Hague Convention
and regarding which details have been given
 above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#In472">Vol. I., §§ 472</a>-476, but they may also assign the
arbitration to one or several arbitrators chosen by
them either from the members of the Permanent Court
of Arbitration or elsewhere (article 55). If they choose
a head of a State as arbitrator, the whole of the arbitral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
procedure is to be determined by him (article 56).
If they choose several arbitrators, an umpire is to
preside, but in case they have not chosen an umpire,
the arbitrators are to elect one of their own number as
president (article 57). If the <i>Compromis</i> is settled by
a Commission, as contemplated by article 54 of Convention
I., and in default of an agreement to the
contrary, the Commission itself shall form the Arbitration
Tribunal (article 58). In case of death, resignation,
or disability of one of the arbitrators from any cause,
his place is to be filled in accordance with the method of
his appointment (article 59). The place of session of the
arbitrators is to be determined by the parties; but if
they fail to do it, the place of session is to be the Hague,
and the place of session may not be changed by the
arbitrators without the consent of the parties; the
Tribunal may only sit in the territory of a third State
with the latter's consent (article 60). The International
Bureau of the Court at the Hague is authorised to put
its offices and its staff at the disposal of the contracting
Powers in case the parties have preferred to bring their
dispute before arbitrators other than the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (article 47).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Procedure
of and
before the
Arbitral
Tribunal.</p></div>

<p>§ 21. The parties may agree upon such rules of
arbitral procedure as they like. If they fail to stipulate
special rules of procedure, the following rules are valid,
whether the parties have brought their case before the
Permanent Court of Arbitration or have chosen other
arbitrators (article 51):&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The parties may appoint counsel or advocates
for the defence of their rights before the tribunal.
They may also appoint delegates or special agents
to attend the tribunal for the purpose of serving as
intermediaries between them and the tribunal. The
members of the Permanent Court, however, may not act
as agents, counsel, or advocates except on behalf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the Power which has appointed them members of the
Court (article 62).</p>

<p>(2) The tribunal selects the languages for its own
use and for use before it, unless the <i>Compromis</i> has
specified the languages to be employed (article 61).</p>

<p>(3) As a rule the arbitral procedure is divided into
the two distinct phases of written pleadings and oral
discussions. The written pleadings consist of the communication
by the respective agents to the members
of the tribunal and to the opposite party of cases,
counter-cases, and, if necessary, replies; the parties
must annex thereto all papers and documents relied
on in the case. This communication is to be made
either directly or through the intermediary of the
International Bureau, in the order and within the time
fixed by the <i>Compromis</i> (article 63). A duly certified
copy of every document produced by one party must
be communicated to the other party (article 64).
Unless special circumstances arise, the tribunal does
not meet until the pleadings are closed (article 65).</p>

<p>(4) Upon the written pleadings follows the oral
discussion in Court; it consists of the oral development
of the pleas of the parties (article 63, last paragraph).
The discussions are under the direction of the president
of the tribunal, and are public only if it be so decided
by the tribunal with the consent of the parties. Minutes
with regard to the discussion are to be drawn up by
secretaries appointed by the president, and only these
official minutes, which are signed by the president and
one of the secretaries, are authentic (article 66). During
the discussion in Court the agents and counsel of the
parties are authorised to present to the tribunal orally
all the arguments they may think expedient in support
of their case. They are likewise authorised to raise
objections and to make incidental motions, but the
decisions of the tribunal on these objections and motions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
are final and cannot form the subject of any further
discussion (articles 70, 71). Every member of the
tribunal may put questions to the agents and counsel of
the parties and demand explanations from them on
doubtful points, but neither such questions nor other
remarks made by members of the tribunal may be
regarded as expressions of opinion by the tribunal in
general or the respective member in particular (article
72). The tribunal may always require from the agents
of the parties all necessary explanations and the production
of all acts, and in case of refusal the tribunal
takes note of it in the minutes (articles 69).</p>

<p>When the competence of the tribunal is doubted
on one or more points, the tribunal itself is authorised
to decide whether it is or is not competent, by means
of interpretation of the <i>Compromis</i> as well as the other
papers and documents which may be adduced in the
matter, and by means of the application of the principles
of law (article 73).</p>

<p>During the discussion in Court&mdash;article 67 says,
"After the close of the pleadings"&mdash;the tribunal is
competent to refuse admittance to all such fresh acts
and documents as one party may desire to submit to the
tribunal without the consent of the other party (article
67). Consequently, the tribunal must admit fresh acts
and documents when both parties agree to their submission.
On the other hand, the tribunal is always
competent to take into consideration fresh papers and
documents to which its attention is drawn by the
agents or counsel of the parties, and in such cases the
tribunal may require production of the papers and
documents, but it is at the same time obliged to make
them known to the other party (article 68).</p>

<p>The parties must supply the tribunal, within the
widest limits they may think practicable, with all the
information required for deciding the dispute (article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
75). For the service of all notices by the tribunal in
the territory of a third contracting Power, the tribunal
applies direct to the Government of such Power. The
same rule is valid in the case of steps being necessary in
order to procure evidence on the spot. The requests
for this purpose are to be executed by the Power concerned
with the means at its disposal according to its
Municipal Law; they may not be rejected unless the
Power concerned considers them of such a nature as
to impair its own sovereign rights or its safety. Instead,
however, of making a direct application to a
third Power, the tribunal is always entitled to have
recourse to the intermediary of the Power on whose
territory it sits (article 76).</p>

<p>As soon as the agents and counsel of the parties
have submitted all explanations and evidence in support
of their case, the president declares the discussion
closed (article 77).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Arbitral
Award.</p></div>

<p>§ 22. The arbitral award is given after a deliberation
which has taken place behind closed doors, and
the proceedings remain secret (article 78). The
members of the tribunal vote, and the majority of the
votes makes the decision of the tribunal. The decision,
accompanied by a statement of the considerations
upon which it is based, is to be drawn up in writing, to
recite the names of the arbitrators, and to be signed
by the president and the registrar or the secretary
acting as the registrar (article 79). The verdict is read
out at a public meeting of the tribunal, the agents and
counsel of the parties being present or having been duly
summoned to attend (article 80).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Binding
force of
Awards.</p></div>

<p>§ 23. The award, when duly pronounced and
notified to the agents of the parties, decides the dispute
finally and without appeal (article 81). Any dispute
arising between the parties as to the interpretation or
execution of the award must, in default of an agreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to the contrary, be submitted to the tribunal which
pronounced it (article 82). The parties may, however,
beforehand stipulate in the <i>Compromis</i> the possibility
of an appeal. In such case, and the <i>Compromis</i> failing
to stipulate the contrary, the demand for a rehearing
of the case must be addressed to the tribunal which
pronounced the award. The demand for a rehearing
of the case may only be made on the ground of the
discovery of some new fact such as may exercise a
decisive influence on the award, and which at the time
when the discussion was closed was unknown to the
tribunal as well as to the appealing party. Proceedings
for a rehearing may only be opened after a decision of
the tribunal expressly stating the existence of a new
fact of the character described, and declaring the
demand admissible on this ground. The treaty of
arbitration must stipulate the period of time within
which the demand for a rehearing must be made
(article 83).&mdash;</p>

<p>The Hague Convention contains no stipulation
whatever with regard to the question whether the
award is binding under all circumstances and conditions,
or whether it is only binding when the tribunal
has in every way fulfilled its duty and has been able
to find its verdict in perfect independence. But it is
obvious that the award has no binding force whatever
if the tribunal has been bribed or has not followed the
parties' instructions given by the treaty of agreement;
if the award was given under the influence of undue
coercion; or, lastly, if one of the parties has intentionally
and maliciously led the tribunal into an
essential material error. (See above, § <a href="#An_arbitral_verdict16">16</a>).</p>

interpreting a convention to which other States than
the States at variance are parties, the conflicting States
have to inform all the contracting Powers of such convention
in good time. Each of these States has a right
to intervene in the case before the tribunal, and, if one or
more avail themselves of this right, the interpretation
contained in the award is as binding upon them as
upon the conflicting parties (article 84).</p>

Procedure.</p></div>

<p>§ 25<i>a</i>. With a view to facilitating the working of
arbitration in disputes of minor importance admitting
an abbreviated procedure, the contracting Powers
propose the following rules for a summary procedure
exclusively in writing:&mdash;</p>

<p>Each of the conflicting parties appoints an arbitrator,
and these arbitrators need not necessarily
be members of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.
The two arbitrators thus appointed choose a third as
umpire, who need not be a member of the Permanent
Court either. But if they cannot agree upon an umpire,
each of them proposes two candidates taken from the
general list of the Permanent Court of Arbitration
exclusive of such members as are either appointed by
the conflicting States or are their nationals, and it is to
be determined by lot which of the candidates shall be
the umpire. This umpire presides over the tribunal
which gives its decisions by a majority of votes (article
87). In the absence of an agreement concerning the
matter, the tribunal settles the time within which the
two parties must submit their respective cases to it
(article 88). Each party is represented by an agent
who serves as intermediary between the tribunal and
his party (article 89). The proceedings are conducted
exclusively in writing. Each party, however, is entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to ask that witnesses and experts should be
called, and the tribunal has the right to demand oral
explanations from the agents as well as from the
experts and witnesses whose appearance in Court it
may consider useful (article 90). Articles 52 to 85
of Convention I. apply so far as they are not inconsistent
with the rules laid down in articles 87 to 90
(article 80).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception and kinds of Compulsive Means of Settlement.</p></div>

<p>§ 26. Compulsive means of settlement of differences
are measures containing a certain amount of
compulsion taken by a State for the purpose of making
another State consent to such settlement of a difference
as is required by the former. There are four different
kinds of such means in use&mdash;namely, retorsion, reprisals
(including embargo), pacific blockade, and intervention.
But it must be mentioned that, whereas every
amicable means of settling differences might find
application in every kind of difference, not every compulsive
means is applicable in every difference. For
the application of retorsion is confined to political, and
that of reprisals to legal differences.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Compulsive
Means in
contradistinction
to War.</p></div>

<p>§ 27. <a name="Wa27" id="Wa27"></a>War is very often enumerated among the
compulsive means of settling international differences.
This is in a sense correct, for a State might make war
for no other purpose than that of compelling another
State to settle a difference in the way required before
war was declared. Nevertheless, the characteristics of
compulsive means of settling international differences
make it a necessity to draw a sharp line between these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
means and war. It is, firstly, characteristic of compulsive
means that, although they frequently consist
of harmful measures, they are neither by the conflicting
nor by other States considered as acts of war,
and consequently all relations of peace, such as diplomatic
and commercial intercourse, the execution of
treaties, and the like, remain undisturbed. Compulsive
means are in theory and practice considered
peaceable, although not amicable, means of settling
international differences. It is, further, characteristic
of compulsive means that they are even at their worst
confined to the application of certain harmful measures
only, whereas belligerents in war may apply any amount
and any kinds of force, with the exception only of those
methods forbidden by International Law. And, thirdly,
it is characteristic of compulsive means that their
application must cease as soon as their purpose is realised
by the compelled State declaring its readiness to settle
the difference in the way requested by the compelling
State; whereas, war once broken out, a belligerent is
not obliged to lay down arms if and when the other
belligerent is ready to comply with the request made
before the war. As war is the <i>ultima ratio</i> between
States, the victorious belligerent is not legally prevented
from imposing upon the defeated any conditions
he likes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Compulsive
Means in
contradistinction
to
an Ultimatum
and Demonstrations.</p></div>

<p>§ 28. <a name="The_above-described28" id="The_above-described28"></a>The above-described characteristics of compulsive
means for the settlement of international
differences make it necessary to mention the distinction
between such means and an <i>ultimatum</i>. The latter is
the technical term for a written communication by
one State to another which ends amicable negotiations
respecting a difference, and formulates, for the last
time and categorically, the demands to be fulfilled if
other measures are to be averted. An <i>ultimatum</i> is,
theoretically at least, not a compulsion, although it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
can practically exercise the function of a compulsion,
and although compulsive means, or even war, can be
threatened through the same communication in the
event of a refusal to comply with the demand made.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
And the same is valid with regard to withdrawal of
diplomatic agents, to military and naval demonstrations,
and the like, which some publicists<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> enumerate
among the compulsive means of settlement of
international differences. Although these steps may
contrive, indirectly, the settlement of differences, yet
they do not contain in themselves any compulsion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception
and
Character
of Retorsion.</p></div>

<p>§ 29. Retorsion is the technical term for the retaliation
of discourteous or unkind or unfair and inequitable
acts by acts of the same or a similar kind.
Retorsion has nothing to do with international delinquencies,
as it is not a means of compulsion in the
case of legal differences, but only in the case of certain
political differences. The act which calls for retaliation
is not an illegal act; on the contrary, it is an act that is
within the competence of the doer.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But a State can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
commit many legislative, administrative, or judicial
acts which, although they are not internationally illegal,
contain a discourtesy or unfriendliness to another State
or are unfair and inequitable. If the State against
which such acts are directed considers itself wronged
thereby, a political difference is created which might
be settled by retorsion.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> For this reason&mdash;see Heilborn, <i>System</i>, p. 352, and
Wagner, <i>Zur Lehre von den Streiterledigungsmitteln des Völkerrechts</i>
(1900), pp. 53-60&mdash;it is correctly maintained that retorsion, in
contradistinction to reprisals, is not of legal, but only of political
importance. Nevertheless, a system of the Law of Nations must not omit
the matter of retorsion altogether, because retorsion is in practice an
important means of settling political differences.</p></div>


<div class="sidenote"><p>Retorsion,
when
justified.</p></div>

<p>§ 30. The question when retorsion is and when it
is not justified is not one of law, and is difficult to
answer. The difficulty arises from the fact that retorsion
is a means of settling such differences as are
created, not by internationally illegal, but by discourteous
or unfriendly or unfair and inequitable acts
of one State against another, and that naturally the
conceptions of discourtesy, unfriendliness, and unfairness
cannot be defined very precisely. It depends,
therefore, largely upon the circumstances and conditions
of the special cases whether a State will or will
not consider itself justified in making use of retorsion.
In practice States have frequently made use of retorsion
in cases of unfair treatment of their citizens abroad
through rigorous passport regulations, exclusion of
foreigners from certain professions, the levy of exorbitant
protectionist or fiscal duties; further, in cases of
refusal of the usual mutual judicial assistance, refusal
of admittance of foreign ships to harbours, and in
similar cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Retorsion,
how exercised.</p></div>

<p>§ 31. The essence of retorsion consists in retaliation
for a noxious act by an act of the same kind. But a
State in making use of retorsion is by no means confined
to acts of the same kind as those complained of, acts of a
similar kind being equally admissible. However, acts
of retorsion are confined to acts which are not internationally
illegal. And, further, as retorsion is made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
use of only for the purpose of compelling a State to
alter its discourteous, unfriendly, or unfair behaviour,
all acts of retorsion ought at once to cease when such
State changes its behaviour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Value of
Retorsion.</p></div>

<p>§ 32. The value of retorsion as a means of settling
certain international differences consists in its compulsory
force, which has great power in regulating the
intercourse of States. It is a commonplace of human
nature, and by experience constantly confirmed, that
evil-doers are checked by retaliation, and that those
who are inclined to commit a wrong against others are
often prevented by the fear of it. Through the high
tide of Chauvinism, Protectionism, and unfriendly
feelings against foreign nations, States are often tempted
to legislative, administrative, and judicial acts against
other States which, although not internationally illegal,
nevertheless endanger friendly relations and intercourse
within the Family of Nations. The certainty of retaliation
is the only force which can make States resist
the temptation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Reprisals in contradistinction to Retorsion.</p></div>

<p>§ 33. <a name="Reprisals_is_the_term33" id="Reprisals_is_the_term33"></a>Reprisals is the term applied to such injurious
and otherwise internationally illegal acts of one State
against another as are exceptionally permitted for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
purpose of compelling the latter to consent to a satisfactory
settlement of a difference created by its own
international delinquency. Whereas retorsion consists
in retaliation of discourteous, unfriendly, unfair, and
inequitable acts by acts of the same or a similar kind,
and has nothing to do with international delinquencies,
reprisals are acts, otherwise illegal, performed by a
State for the purpose of obtaining justice for an international
delinquency by taking the law into its own
hands. It is, of course, possible that a State retaliates
in consequence of an illegal act committed against itself
by the performance of an act of a similar kind. Such
retaliation would be a retorsion in the ordinary sense
of the term, but it would not be retorsion in the technical
meaning of the term as used by those writers on
International Law who correctly distinguish between
retorsion and reprisals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Reprisals

<p>§ 34. <a name="Reprisals_are_admissible34" id="Reprisals_are_admissible34"></a>Reprisals are admissible not only, as some

<p>Thus, to give an example, Great Britain, in the case
of the Sicilian Sulphur Monopoly, performed acts of
reprisal against the Two Sicilies in 1840 for a violation
of a treaty. By the treaty of commerce of 1816 between
the Two Sicilies and Great Britain certain commercial
advantages were secured to Great Britain. When, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
1838, the Neapolitan Government granted a Sulphur
Monopoly to a company of French and other foreign
merchants, Great Britain protested against this violation
of her treaty rights, demanded the revocation
of the monopoly, and, after the Neapolitan Government
had declined to comply with this demand, laid an
<i>embargo</i> on Sicilian ships in the harbour of Malta and
ordered her fleet in the Mediterranean to seize Sicilian
ships by way of reprisal. A number of vessels were
captured, but were restored after the Sicilies had,
through the mediation of France, agreed to withdraw
the grant of the Sulphur Monopoly.</p>

<p>Again, when in 1908 de Castro, the President of
Venezuela, dismissed M. de Reuss, the Dutch Minister
Resident at Caracas, Holland considered this step a
violation of her dignity and sent cruisers into Venezuelan
waters with the intention of resorting to reprisals.
These cruisers captured the Venezuelan coast-guard
ship <i>Alexis</i> outside Puerto Cabello, and another
Venezuelan public vessel, both of which, however,
were restored in 1909, when de Castro was deposed,
and the new President opened negotiations with
Holland and settled the conflict.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Reprisals

<p>§ 35. <a name="Reprisals_are_admissible35" id="Reprisals_are_admissible35"></a>Reprisals are admissible in the case of international
delinquencies only and exclusively. As internationally
injurious acts on the part of administrative
and judicial officials, armed forces, and private individuals

the responsible State complies with the requirements
of its vicarious responsibility.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Should, however, a
State refuse to comply with these requirements, its
vicarious responsibility would turn into original responsibility,
and thereby an international delinquency would
be created for which reprisals are indeed admissible.</p>

<p>The reprisals ordered by Great Britain in the case
of Don Pacifico are an illustrative example of unjustified
reprisals, because no international delinquency
was committed. In 1847 a riotous mob, aided by
Greek soldiers and gendarmes, broke into and plundered
the house of Don Pacifico, a native of Gibraltar and an
English subject living at Athens. Great Britain claimed
damages from Greece without previous recourse by
Don Pacifico to the Greek Courts. Greece refused to
comply with the British claim, maintaining correctly
that Don Pacifico ought to institute an action for
damages against the rioters before the Greek Courts.
Great Britain continued to press her claim, and finally
in 1850 blockaded the Greek coast and ordered, by way
of reprisal, the capture of Greek vessels. The conflict
was eventually settled by Greece paying £150 to Don
Pacifico. It is generally recognised that England had
no right to act as she did in this case. She could have
claimed damages directly from the Greek Government
only after the Greek Courts had denied satisfaction to
Don Pacifico.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>§ 36. Acts of reprisal may nowadays be performed
only by State organs such as armed forces, or men-of-war,
or administrative officials, in compliance with a
special order of their State. But in former times
private individuals used to perform acts of reprisal.
Such private acts of reprisal seem to have been in
vogue in antiquity, for there existed a law in Athens
according to which the relatives of an Athenian murdered
abroad had, in case the foreign State refused
punishment or extradition of the murderer, the right
to seize and to bring before the Athenian Courts three
citizens of such foreign State (so-called &#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#955;&#951;&#968;&#8055;&#945;).
During the Middle Ages, and even in modern times to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the end of the eighteenth century, States used to grant
so-called "Letters of Marque" to such of their subjects
as had been injured abroad either by a foreign State
itself or its citizens without being able to get redress.
These Letters of Marque authorised the bearer to acts
of self-help against the State concerned, its citizens
and their property, for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction
for the wrong sustained. In later times,
however, States themselves also performed acts of
reprisal. Thereby acts of reprisal on the part of private
individuals fell more and more into disuse, and finally
disappeared totally with the end of the eighteenth
century. The distinction between general and special
reprisals, which used formerly to be drawn, is based
on the fact that in former times a State could either
authorise a single private individual to perform an act
of reprisal (<i>special</i> reprisals), or command its armed
forces to perform all kinds of such acts (<i>general</i> reprisals).
The term "General Reprisals" is by Great Britain
nowadays used for the authorisation of the British
fleet to seize in time of war all enemy ships and goods.
Phillimore (III. § 10) cites the following Order in Council
of March 27, 1854: "Her Majesty having determined
to afford active assistance to her ally, His Highness
the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, for the protection
of his dominions against the encroachments and unprovoked
aggression of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor
of All the Russias, Her Majesty is therefore pleased, by
and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to order,
and it is hereby ordered, that general reprisals be granted
against the ships, vessels, and goods of the Emperor of
All the Russias, and of his subjects, or others inhabiting
within any of his countries, territories or dominions, so
that Her Majesty's fleets may lawfully seize all ships,
vessels, and goods," &amp;c.</p>

<p>§ 37. <a name="An_act_of_reprisal37" id="An_act_of_reprisal37"></a>An act of reprisal may be performed against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
anything and everything that belongs or is due to the
delinquent State or its citizens. Ships sailing under
its flag may be seized, treaties concluded with it may
be suspended, a part of its territory may be militarily
occupied, goods belonging to it or to its citizens may
be seized, and the like. Thus in 1895 Great Britain
ordered a fleet to land forces at Corinto and to occupy
the custom-house and other Government buildings as an
act of reprisal against Nicaragua; again, in 1901 France
ordered a fleet to seize the island of Mitylene as an act
of reprisal against Turkey; and in 1908 Holland ordered
a squadron to seize two public Venezuelan vessels as
an act of reprisal against Venezuela.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The persons
of the officials and even of the private citizens of the
delinquent State are not excluded from the possible
objects of reprisals. Thus, when in 1740 the Empress
Anne of Russia arrested without just cause the Baron
de Stackelberg, a natural-born Russian subject, who
had, however, become naturalised in Prussia by entering
the latter's service, Frederick II. of Prussia seized
by way of reprisal two Russian subjects and detained
them until Stackelberg was liberated. But it must be
emphasised that the only act of reprisal admissible
with regard to foreign officials or citizens is arrest; they
must not be treated like criminals, but like hostages,
and under no condition or circumstance may they be
executed or subjected to punishment of any kind.</p>

<p>The rule that anything and everything belonging
to the delinquent State may be made the object of
reprisals has, however, exceptions; for instance, individuals
enjoying the privilege of exterritoriality while
abroad, such as heads of States and diplomatic envoys,
may not be made the object of reprisals, although
this has occasionally been done in practice.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
to another exception&mdash;namely, public debts of such
State as intends performing reprisals&mdash;unanimity does
not exist either in theory or in practice. When
Frederick II. of Prussia in 1752, by way of negative
reprisals for an alleged injustice of British Prize Courts
against Prussian subjects, refused the payment of the
Silesian loan due to English creditors, Great Britain,
in addition to denying the question that there was at
all a just cause for reprisals, maintained that public
debts may not be made the object of reprisals. English
jurists and others, as, for instance, Vattel (II. § 344),
consent to this, but German writers dissent.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>§ 38. Reprisals can be positive or negative. One
speaks of positive reprisals when such acts are performed
as would under ordinary circumstances involve
an international delinquency. On the other hand,
negative reprisals consist of refusals to perform such
acts as are under ordinary circumstances obligatory;
when, for instance, the fulfilment of a treaty obligation
or the payment of a debt is refused.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Reprisals

<p>§ 39. Reprisals, be they positive or negative, must
be in proportion to the wrong done and to the amount
of compulsion necessary to get reparation. For instance,
a State would not be justified in arresting by
way of reprisal thousands of foreign subjects living on
its territory whose home State had injured it through a
denial of justice to one of its subjects living abroad.
But it would in such case be justified in ordering its
own Courts to deny justice to all subjects of such
foreign State, or in ordering its fleet to seize several
vessels sailing under the latter State's flag, or in suspending
its commercial treaty with such State.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Embargo.</p></div>

<p>§ 40. <a name="A_kind_of_reprisal40" id="A_kind_of_reprisal40"></a>A kind of reprisal, which is called <i>Embargo</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
must be specially mentioned. This term of Spanish
origin means detention, but in International Law it
has the technical meaning of detention of ships in
port. Now, as by way of reprisal all acts, otherwise
illegal, may be performed, there is no doubt that ships
of the delinquent State may be prevented from leaving
the ports of the injured State for the purpose of compelling
the delinquent State to make reparation for
the wrong done.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

embargo on Sicilian ships.</p></div>

<p>The matter would not need special mention were it
not for the fact that <i>embargo</i> by way of reprisal is to
be distinguished from detention of ships for other
reasons. According to a now obsolete<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> rule of International
Law, conflicting States could, when war was
breaking out or impending, lay an <i>embargo</i> on, and
appropriate each other's merchantmen. Another kind
of <i>embargo</i> is the so-called <i>arrêt de prince</i><a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;that is, a
detention of foreign ships for the purpose of preventing
them from spreading news of political importance.
And there is, thirdly, an <i>embargo</i> arising out of the so-called
<i>jus angariæ</i>&mdash;that is, the right of a belligerent
State to seize and make use of neutral property in case
of necessity, under the obligation to compensate the
neutral owner of such property. States have in the
past<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> made use of this kind of <i>embargo</i> when they
had not enough ships for the necessary transport of

after negotiations have been conducted in vain for the

of commerce and peace frequently stipulated for a

grant of Letters of Marque by the injured State.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Although
with the disappearance of special reprisals this
is now antiquated, a reasonable time for the performance

<p>§ 43. The value of reprisals as a means of settling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
international differences is analogous to the value of
retorsion. States will have recourse to reprisals for
such international delinquencies as they think insufficiently
important for a declaration of war, but too
important to be entirely overlooked. That reprisals
are rather a rough means for the settlement of differences,
and that the institution of reprisals can give
and has in the past given occasion to abuse in case of a
difference between a powerful and a weak State, cannot
be denied. On the other hand, as there is no Court
and no central authority above the Sovereign States
which could compel a delinquent State to give reparation,
the institution of reprisals can scarcely be abolished.
The influence in the future of the existence of a Permanent
Court of Arbitration remains to be seen. If all
the States would become parties to the Hague Convention
for the peaceful adjustment of international
differences, and if they would have recourse to the
Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague in all
cases of an alleged international delinquency which
affects neither their national honour nor their vital
interests and independence, acts of reprisal would
almost disappear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

Blockade.</p></div>

<p>§ 44. Before the nineteenth century blockade was
only known as a measure between belligerents in
time of war. It was not until the second quarter
of the nineteenth century that the first case occurred
of a so-called pacific blockade&mdash;that is, a blockade
during time of peace&mdash;as a compulsive means of settling
international differences; and all such cases are
either cases of intervention or of reprisals.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The
first case, one of intervention, happened in 1827, when,
during the Greek insurrection, Great Britain, France,
and Russia intervened in the interest of the independence
of Greece and blockaded those parts of the
Greek coast which were occupied by Turkish troops.
Although this blockade led to the battle of Navarino,
in which the Turkish fleet was destroyed, the Powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
maintained, nevertheless, that they were not at war
with Turkey. In 1831, France blockaded the Tagus
as an act of reprisal for the purpose of exacting redress
from Portugal for injuries sustained by French subjects.
Great Britain and France, exercising intervention
for the purpose of making Holland consent to
the independence of revolting Belgium, blockaded in
1833 the coast of Holland. In 1838, France blockaded
the ports of Mexico as an act of reprisal, but Mexico
declared war against France in answer to this pacific
blockade. Likewise as an act of reprisal, and in the
same year, France blockaded the ports of Argentina;
and in 1845, conjointly with Great Britain, France
blockaded the ports of Argentina a second time. In
1850, in the course of her differences with Greece on
account of the case of Don Pacifico,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Great Britain
blockaded the Greek ports, but for Greek vessels only.
Another case of intervention was the pacific blockade
instituted in 1860 by Sardinia, in aid of an insurrection
against the then Sicilian ports of Messina and Gaeta,
but the following year saw the conversion of the pacific
blockade into a war blockade. In 1862 Great Britain
by way of reprisal for the plundering of a wrecked
British merchantman, blockaded the Brazilian port of
Rio de Janeiro. The blockade of the island of Formosa
by France during her differences with China in 1884
and that of the port of Menam by France during her
differences with Siam in 1893 are likewise cases of
reprisals. On the other hand, cases of intervention
are the blockade of the Greek coast in 1886 by Great
Britain, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, and Russia,
for the purpose of preventing Greece from making war
against Turkey; and further, the blockade of the
island of Crete in 1897 by the united Powers. The last
case occurred in 1902, when Great Britain, Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and Italy blockaded, by way of reprisal, the coast of
Venezuela.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_46_46" id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> A blockade instituted by a State against such portions of
its own territory as are in revolt is not a blockade for the purpose of
settling international differences. It has, therefore, in itself nothing
to do with the Law of Nations, but is a matter of internal police. I
cannot, therefore, agree with Holland, who, in his <i>Studies in
International Law</i>, p. 138, treats it as a pacific blockade <i>sensu
generali</i>. Of course, necessity of self-preservation only can justify a
State that has blockaded one of its own ports in preventing the egress
and ingress of <i>foreign</i> vessels. And the question might arise whether
compensation ought not to be paid for losses sustained by foreign
vessels so detained.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> This blockade, although ostensibly a war blockade for the
purpose of preventing the ingress of foreign vessels, was nevertheless
essentially a pacific blockade. See Holland, in <i>The Law Quarterly
Review</i>, XIX. (1903), p. 133; Parliamentary Papers, Venezuela, No. 1
(Venezuela), Correspondence respecting the Affairs of Venezuela.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Admissibility
of
Pacific
Blockade.</p></div>

<p>§ 45. No unanimity exists among international
lawyers with regard to the question whether or not
pacific blockades are admissible according to the
principles of the Law of Nations. There is no doubt
that the theory of the Law of Nations forbids the
seizure and sequestration of vessels other than those of
the blockaded State caught in an attempt to break a
pacific blockade. For even those writers who maintain
the admissibility of pacific blockade assert that vessels
of third States cannot be seized. What is controverted
is the question whether according to International Law
the coast of a State may be blockaded at all in time of
peace. From the first recorded instance to the last,
several writers<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of authority have negatived the
question. On the other hand, many writers have
answered the question in the affirmative, differing
among themselves regarding the one point only whether
or not vessels sailing under the flag of third States
could be prevented from entering or leaving pacifically
blockaded ports. The Institute of International Law
in 1887 carefully studied, and at its meeting in Heidelberg
discussed, the question, and finally voted a declaration<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
in favour of the admissibility of pacific
blockades. Thus the most influential body of theorists
has approved what had been established before by
practice. There ought to be no doubt that the numerous
cases of pacific blockade which have occurred during
the nineteenth century have, through tacit consent of
the members of the Family of Nations, established the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
admissibility of pacific blockades for the settlement
of political as well as of legal international differences.</p>

<p>§ 46. It has already been stated that those writers
who admit the legality of pacific blockades are unanimous
regarding the fact that no right exists for the
blockading State to seize and sequestrate such ships of
third States as try to break a pacific blockade. Apart
from this, no unanimity exists with regard to the
question of the relation between a pacific blockade
and ships of third States. Some German writers<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
maintain that such ships have to respect the blockade,
and that the blockading State has a right to stop such
ships of third States as try to break a pacific blockade.
The vast majority of writers, however, deny such right.
There is, in fact, no rule of International Law which
could establish such a right, as pacific in contradistinction
to belligerent blockade is a mere matter between
the conflicting parties. The declaration of the Institute
of International Law in favour of pacific
blockade contains, therefore, the condition: "Les
navires de pavillons neutres peuvent entrer librement
malgré le blocus."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> See
 Heffter, § 112; Perels, § 30.</p></div>

<p>The practice of pacific blockade has varied with
regard to ships of third States. Before 1850 ships
of third States were expected to respect a pacific
blockade, and such ships of these States as tried to
break it were seized, but were restored at the termination
of the blockade, yet without any compensation.
When in 1850 Great Britain, and likewise when in 1886
Great Britain, Austria, Germany, Italy, and Russia
blockaded the Greek ports, these ports were only closed
for Greek ships, and others were allowed to pass
through. And the same was the case during the
blockade of Crete in 1897. On the other hand, in 1894,
France, during a conflict with China, blockaded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
island of Formosa and tried to enforce the blockade
against ships of third States. But Great Britain declared
that a pacific blockade could not be enforced
against ships of third States, whereupon France had to
drop her intended establishment of a pacific blockade
and had to consider herself at war with China. And
when in 1902 Great Britain, Germany, and Italy instituted
a blockade against Venezuela, they declared
it a war blockade<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> because they intended to enforce it
against vessels of third States.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> That
 this blockade was essentially a pacific blockade I have already
stated above, <a href="#Footnote_48_48">p. 50, note 1</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Pacific
Blockade
and
vessels of
the blockaded
State.</p></div>

<p>§ 47. Theory and practice seem nowadays to agree
upon the rule that the ships of a pacifically blockaded
State trying to break the blockade may be seized and
sequestrated. But they may not be condemned and
confiscated, as they have to be restored at the termination
of the blockade. Thus, although the Powers
which had instituted a blockade against Venezuela in
1902 declared it a war blockade, all Venezuelan public
and private ships seized were restored after the blockade
was raised.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Manner
of Pacific
Blockade.</p></div>

<p>§ 48. Pacific blockade is a measure of such enormous
consequences that it can be justified only after the
failure of preceding negotiations for the purpose of
settling the questions in dispute. And further, as
blockade, being a violation of the territorial supremacy
of the blockaded State, is <i>prima facie</i> of a hostile
character, it is necessary for such State as intends in
time of peace to blockade another State to notify its
intention to the latter and to fix the day and hour
for the establishment of the blockade. And, thirdly,
although the Declaration of Paris of 1856 enacting
that a blockade to be binding must be effective concerns
blockades in time of war only, there can be no
doubt that pacific blockades ought to be likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
effective. The declaration of the Institute of International
Law in favour of pacific blockade contains,
therefore, the condition: "Le blocus pacifique doit
être déclaré et notifié officiellement, et maintenu par
une force suffisante."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Value of

<p>§ 49. As the establishment of a pacific blockade
has in various instances not prevented the outbreak
of hostilities, the value of a pacific blockade as a means
of non-hostile settlement of international differences
is doubted and considered uncertain by many writers.
But others agree, and I think they are right, that the
institution of pacific blockade is of great value, be it
as an act of reprisal or of intervention. Every measure
which is suitable and calculated to prevent the outbreak
of war must be welcomed, and experience shows that
pacific blockade is, although not universally successful,
a measure of this kind. That it can give, and has in
the past given, occasion for abuse in case of a difference
between a strong and a weak Power is no argument
against it, as the same is valid with regard to reprisals
and intervention in general, and even to war. And
although it is naturally a measure which will scarcely
be made use of in case of a difference between two
powerful naval States, it might nevertheless find application
with success against a powerful naval State if
exercised by the united navies of several Powers.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>§ 50. <a name="In50" id="In50"></a>Intervention as a means of settling international
differences is only a special kind of intervention
in general, which has already been discussed.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
It consists in the dictatorial interference of a third
State in a difference between two States for the purpose
of settling the difference in the way demanded by the
intervening State. This dictatorial interference takes
place for the purpose of exercising a compulsion upon
one or both of the parties in conflict, and must be distinguished
from such attitude of a State as makes it a
party to the very conflict. If two States are in conflict
and a third State joins one of them out of friendship
or from any other motive, such third State does not
exercise an intervention as a means of settling international
differences, but becomes a party to the conflict.
If, for instance, an alliance exists between one
of two States in conflict and a third, and if eventually,
as war has broken out in consequence of the conflict,
such third State comes to the help of its ally, no intervention
in the technical sense of the term takes place.
A State intervening in a dispute between two other
States does not become a party to their dispute, but is
the author of a new imbroglio, because such third State
dictatorially requests those other States to settle their
difference in a way to which both, or at any rate one
of them, objects. An intervention, for instance, takes
place when, although two States in conflict have made
up their minds to fight it out in war, a third State
dictatorially requests them to settle their dispute
through arbitration.</p>

<p>Intervention, in the form of dictatorial interference,
must, further, be distinguished from such efforts of
a State as are directed to induce the States in conflict
to settle their difference amicably by proffering
its good offices or mediation, or by giving friendly
advice. It is, therefore, incorrect when some jurists<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
speak of good offices and the like as an "amicable"
in contradistinction to a "hostile" intervention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Mode of
Intervention.</p></div>

<p>§ 51. Intervention in a difference between two
States is exercised through a communication of the
intervening State to one or both of the conflicting
States with a dictatorial request for the settlement of
the conflict in a certain way, for instance by arbitration
or by the acceptance of certain terms. An intervention
can take place either on the part of one State
alone or of several States collectively. If the parties
comply with the request of the intervening State or
States, the intervention is terminated. If, however,
one or both of the parties fail to comply with the request,
the intervening State will either withdraw its intervention
or proceed to the performance of acts more
stringent than a mere request, such as pacific blockade,
military occupation, and the like. Even war can be
declared for the purpose of an intervention. Of special
importance are the collective interventions exercised
by several great Powers in the interest of the balance
of power and of humanity.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Time of

<p>§ 52. An intervention in a difference between two
States can take place at any time from the moment a
conflict arises till the moment it is settled, and even
immediately after the settlement. In many cases
interventions have taken place before the outbreak of
war between two States for the purpose of preventing
war; in other cases third States have intervened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
during a war which had broken out in consequence of
a conflict. Interventions have, further, taken place
immediately after the peaceable settlement of a difference,
or after the termination of war by a treaty of
peace or by conquest, on the grounds that the conditions
of the settlement or the treaty of peace were against
the interests of the intervening State, or because the
latter would not consent to the annexation of the conquered
State by the victor.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>War no
illegality.</p></div>

<p>§ 53. As within the boundaries of the modern State
an armed contention between two or more citizens
is illegal, public opinion has become convinced that
armed contests between citizens are inconsistent with
Municipal Law. Influenced by this fact, impatient
pacifists, as well as those innumerable individuals who
cannot grasp the idea of a law between Sovereign
States, frequently consider war and law inconsistent.
They quote the fact that wars are frequently waged by
States as a proof against the very existence of an
International Law. It is not difficult to show the
absurdity of this opinion. As States are Sovereign,
and as consequently no central authority can exist
above them able to enforce compliance with its demands,
war cannot, under the existing conditions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
circumstances of the Family of Nations, always be
avoided. International Law recognises this fact, but
at the same time provides regulations with which
belligerents have to comply. Although with the outbreak
of war peaceable relations between the belligerents
cease, there remain certain mutual legal obligations and
duties. Thus war is not inconsistent with, but a condition
regulated by, International Law. The latter
at present cannot and does not object to States which
are in conflict waging war upon each other instead of
peaceably settling their difference. But if they choose
to go to war they have to comply with the rules laid
down by International Law regarding the conduct of
war and the relations between belligerents and neutral
States. That International Law, if it could forbid war
altogether, would be a more perfect law than it is at
present there is no doubt. Yet eternal peace is an
impossibility in the conditions and circumstances under
which mankind at present live and will have to live for
a long time to come, although eternal peace is certainly
an ideal of civilisation which will slowly and gradually
be realised.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception
of
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 54. <a name="War_is_the_contention54" id="War_is_the_contention54"></a>War is the contention between two or more
States through their armed forces for the purpose of
overpowering each other and imposing such conditions
of peace as the victor pleases. War is a fact
recognised, and with regard to many points regulated,
but not established, by International Law. Those
writers<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> who define war as the legal remedy of self-help
to obtain satisfaction for a wrong sustained from
another State, forget that wars have often been waged
by both parties engaged for political reasons only; they
confound a possible but not at all necessary cause of
war with the conception of war. A State may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
driven into war because it cannot otherwise get reparation
for an international delinquency, and such
State may then maintain that it exercises by war
nothing else than legally recognised self-help. But
when States are driven into or deliberately wage war
for political reasons, no legally recognised act of self-help
is in such case performed by the war. And the
same laws of war are valid, whether wars are waged on
account of legal or of political differences.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> See, for instance, Vattel, III. § 1; Phillimore, III. § 49;
Twiss, II. § 26; Bluntschli, § 510; Bulmerincq, § 92.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>War a
contention.</p></div>

<p>§ 55. In any case, it is universally recognised that
war is a <i>contention</i>, which means, <i>a violent struggle
through the application of armed force</i>. For a war to
be in existence, two or more States must actually have
their armed forces fighting against each other, although
the commencement of a war may date back to its declaration
or some other unilateral initiative act. Unilateral
acts of force performed by one State against
another without a previous declaration of war may be
a cause of the outbreak of war, but are not war in
themselves, as long as they are not answered by similar
hostile acts by the other side, or at least by a declaration
of the other side that it considers the particular
acts as acts of war. Thus it comes about that acts of
force performed by one State against another by way
of reprisal or during a pacific blockade in the case of
an intervention are not necessarily initiative acts of
war. And even acts of force illegally performed by
one State against another, such, for instance, as occupation
of a part of its territory, are not acts of war so
long as they are not met with acts of force from the
other side, or at least with a declaration from the latter
that it considers the particular acts as acts of war.
Thus, when Louis XIV. of France, after the Peace of
Nimeguen, instituted the so-called Chambers of Reunion
and in 1680 and 1681 seized the territory of the then
Free Town of Strassburg and other parts of the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Empire without the latter's offering armed resistance,
these acts of force, although doubtless illegal, were not
acts of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>War a
contention
between
States.</p></div>

<p>§ 56. <a name="To_be_considered_war56" id="To_be_considered_war56"></a>To be considered war, the contention must
be going on <i>between States</i>. In the Middle Ages wars
were known between private individuals, so-called
private wars, and wars between corporations, as the
Hansa for instance, and between States. But such
wars have totally disappeared in modern times. It
may, of course, happen that a contention arises between
the armed forces of a State and a body of armed individuals,
but such contention<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> is not war. Thus the
contention between the Raiders under Dr. Jameson
and the former South African Republic in January
1896 was not war. Nor is a contention with insurgents
or with pirates a war. And a so-called civil war<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> need
not be from the beginning nor become at all a war in the
technical sense of the term according to International
Law. On the other hand, to an armed contention
between a suzerain and its vassal<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> State the character
of war ought not to be denied, for both parties are
States, although the fact that the vassal makes war
against the suzerain may, from the standpoint of Constitutional
Law, be considered rebellion. And likewise
an armed contention between a full Sovereign State
and a State under the suzerainty of another State, as,
for instance, the contention between Servia and Bulgaria<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
in 1885, is war. Again, an armed contention
between one or more member-States of a Federal State
and the latter ought to be considered as war in the
technical sense of the term, according to International
Law, although, according to the constitution of Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
States, war between the member-States as well as
between any member-State and the Federal State itself
is illegal, and recourse to arms by a member-State
may therefore correctly, from the standpoint of the constitution,
be called rebellion. Thus the War of Secession
within the United States between the Northern and
the Southern member-States in 1861-1865 was real war.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_59_59" id="Footnote_59_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Some publicists maintain, however, that a contention
between a State and the armed forces of a party fighting for public
rights must be considered as war. See, for instance, Bluntschli, § 113,
and Fiore, III. § 1265.</p></div>

<p>§ 57. <a name="It_must_be_emphasised57" id="It_must_be_emphasised57"></a>It must be emphasised that war nowadays
is a contention of States <i>through their armed forces</i>.
Those private subjects of the belligerents who do not
directly or indirectly belong to the armed forces do
not take part in the armed contention: they do not
attack and defend, and no attack is therefore made
upon them. This fact is the result of an evolution of
practices totally different from those in vogue in former
times. During antiquity and the greater part of the
Middle Ages war was a contention between the whole
of the populations of the belligerent States. In time of
war every subject of one belligerent, whether an armed
and fighting individual or not, whether man or woman,
adult or infant, could be killed or enslaved by the other
belligerent at will. But gradually a milder and more
discriminative practice grew up, and nowadays the
life and liberty of such private subjects of belligerents
as do not directly or indirectly belong to their armed
forces are safe, as is also, with certain exceptions, their
private property.</p>

<p>This is a generally admitted fact. But opinions
disagree as to the general position of such private
subjects in time of war. The majority of the European
continental writers for the last three generations have
propagated the doctrine that no relation of enmity
exists between belligerents and such private subjects,
or between the private subjects of the respective belligerents.
This doctrine goes back to Rousseau, <i>Contrat
Social</i>, I. c. 4. In 1801, on the occasion of the opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of the French Prize Court, the famous lawyer and
statesman Portalis adopted Rousseau's<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> doctrine by
declaring that war is a relation between States and not
between individuals, and that consequently the subjects
of the belligerents are only enemies as soldiers,
not as citizens. And although this new doctrine did
not, as Hall (§ 18) shows, spread at once, it has since
the second half of the nineteenth century been proclaimed
on the European continent by the majority
of writers. British and American-English writers,
however, have never adopted this doctrine, but have
always maintained that the relation of enmity between
the belligerents extends also to their private citizens.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> See
 Lassudrie-Duchêne, <i>Jean Jacques Rousseau et le droit
des gens</i> (1906).</p></div>

<p>I think, if the facts of war are taken into consideration
without prejudice, there ought to be no doubt
that the British and American view is correct.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It is
impossible to sever the citizens from their State, and
the outbreak of war between two States cannot but
make their citizens enemies. But the point is unworthy
of dispute, because it is only one of terms
without any material consequences.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> For, apart from
the terminology, the parties agree in substance upon
the rules of the Law of Nations regarding such private
subjects as do not directly or indirectly belong to the
armed forces.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Nobody doubts that such private individuals
are safe as regards their life and liberty, provided
they behave peacefully and loyally; and that,
with certain exceptions, their private property must
not be touched. On the other hand, nobody doubts
that, according to a generally recognised custom of
modern warfare, the belligerent who has occupied a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
part or the whole of his opponent's territory, and who
treats such private individuals leniently according to
the rules of International Law, may punish them for any
hostile act, since they do not enjoy the privileges of
members of armed forces. Although, on the one hand,
International Law by no means forbids, and, as a law
between States, is not competent to forbid, private
individuals to take up arms against an enemy, it gives,
on the other hand, the right to the enemy to treat
hostilities committed by private<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> individuals as acts
of illegitimate warfare. A belligerent is under a duty
to respect the life and liberty of private enemy individuals,
but he can carry out this duty under the
condition only that these private individuals abstain
from hostilities against himself. Through military
occupation in war such private individuals fall under
the authority<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> of the occupant, and he may therefore
demand that they comply with his orders regarding
the safety of his forces. The position of private enemy
individuals is made known to them through the proclamations
which the commander-in-chief of an army
occupying the territory usually publishes. Thus
General Sir Redvers Buller, when entering the territory
of the South African Republic in 1900, published the
following proclamation:</p>

<p>"The troops of Queen Victoria are now passing
through the Transvaal. Her Majesty does not make
war on individuals, but is, on the contrary, anxious
to spare them as far as may be possible the horrors of
war. The quarrel England has is with the Government,
not with the people, of the Transvaal. Provided
they remain neutral, no attempt will be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to interfere with persons living near the line of march;
every possible protection will be given them, and any
of their property that it may be necessary to take will
be paid for. But, on the other hand, those who are thus
allowed to remain near the line of march must respect
and maintain their neutrality, and the residents of any
locality will be held responsible, both in their persons
and property, if any damage is done to railway or
telegraph, or any violence done to any member of the
British forces in the vicinity of their home."</p>

through military occupation private enemy individuals fall under the
<i>territorial supremacy</i> of the occupant. Since military occupation by no
means vests sovereignty in the occupant, but only actual authority, this
authority may not be called <i>territorial supremacy</i>.</p></div>

<p>It must be emphasised that this position of private
individuals of the hostile States renders it inevitable
that commanders of armies which have occupied
hostile territory should consider and mark as criminals
all such private individuals of the enemy as commit
hostile acts, although such individuals may act from
patriotic motives and may be highly praised for their
acts by their compatriots. The high-sounding and
well-meant words of Baron Lambermont, one of the
Belgian delegates at the Conference of Brussels of
1874&mdash;"Il y a des choses qui se font à la guerre, qui
se feront toujours, et que l'on doit bien accepter. Mais
il s'agit ici de les convertir en lois, en prescriptions
positives et internationales. Si les citoyens doivent
être conduits au supplice pour avoir tenté de défendre
leur pays au péril de leur vie, il ne faut pas qu'ils
trouvent inscrits sur le poteau au pied duquel ils seront
fusilés l'article d'un traité signé par leur propre gouvernement
qui d'avance les condamnait à mort"&mdash;have no
<i>raison d'être</i> in face of the fact that according to a
generally recognised customary rule of International
Law hostile acts on the part of private individuals are
not acts of legitimate warfare, and the offenders may
be treated and punished as war-criminals. Even those
writers<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> who object to the term "criminals" do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
deny that such hostile acts by private individuals, in
contradistinction to hostile acts by members of the
armed forces, may be severely punished. The controversy
whether or not such acts may be styled
"crimes" is again only one of terminology; materially
the rule is not at all controverted.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> It is of value to quote articles 20-26 of the <i>Instructions
for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field</i>, which
the War Department of the United States published in 1863 during the War
of Secession with the Southern member-States:
</p><p>
(20) "Public war is a state of armed hostility between sovereign nations
or governments. It is a law and requisite of civil existence that men
live in political, continuous societies, forming organised units, called
States or nations, whose constituents bear, enjoy, and suffer, advance
and retrograde together, in peace and in war."
</p><p>
(21) "The citizen or native of a hostile country is thus an enemy as one
of the constituents of the hostile State or nation, and as such is
subjected to the hardships of war."
</p><p>
(22) "Nevertheless, as civilisation has advanced during the last
centuries, so has likewise advanced, especially in war on land, the
distinction between the private individual belonging to a hostile
country and the hostile country itself, with its men in arms. The
principle has been more and more acknowledged that the unarmed citizen
is to be spared in person, property, and honour as much as the
exigencies of war will admit."
</p><p>
(23) "Private citizens are no longer murdered, enslaved, or carried off
to distant parts, and the inoffensive individual is as little disturbed
in his private relations as the commander of the hostile troops can
afford to grant in the overruling demands of a vigorous war."
</p><p>
(24) "The almost universal rule in remote times was ... that the private
individual of the hostile country is destined to suffer every privation
of liberty and protection and every disruption of family ties.
Protection was ... the exception."
</p><p>
(25) "In modern regular wars ... protection of the inoffensive citizens
of the hostile country is the rule; privation and disturbance of private
relations are the exceptions."
</p><p>
(26) "Commanding generals may cause the magistrates and civil officers
of the hostile country to take the oath of temporary allegiance or an
oath of fidelity to their own victorious Government or rulers, and they
may expel every one who declines to do so. But, whether they do so or
not, the people and their civil officers owe strict obedience to them as
long as they hold sway over the district or country, at the peril of
their lives."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>War a
contention
between
States for
the purpose
of
overpowering
each
other.</p></div>

<p>§ 58. The last, and not the least important, characteristic
of war is its purpose. It is a contention
between States for the purpose of overpowering each
other. This purpose of war is not to be confounded
with the ends<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of war, for, whatever the ends of war
may be, they can only be realised by one belligerent
overpowering the other. Such a defeat as compels
the vanquished to comply with any demand the victor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
may choose to make is the purpose of war. Therefore
war calls into existence the display of the greatest
possible power and force on the part of the belligerents,
rouses the passion of the nations in conflict to the
highest possible degree, and endangers the welfare,
the honour, and eventually the very existence of both
belligerents. Nobody can predict with certainty the
result of a war however insignificant one side may seem
to be. Every war is a risk and a venture. Every
State which goes to war knows beforehand what is at
stake, and it would never go to war were it not for
its firm, though very often illusory, conviction of its
superiority in strength over its opponent. Victory is
necessary in order to overpower the enemy; and it
is this necessity which justifies all the indescribable
horrors of war, the enormous sacrifice of human life
and health, and the unavoidable destruction of property
and devastation of territory. Apart from special restrictions
imposed by the Law of Nations upon belligerents,
all kinds and all degrees of force may be, and
eventually must be, made use of in war in the interest
and under the compulsion of its purpose, and in spite
of their cruelty and the utter misery they entail. As
war is a struggle for existence between States, no amount
of individual suffering and misery can be regarded; the
national existence and independence of the struggling
State is a higher consideration than any individual
well-being.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Civil War.</p></div>

<p>§ 59. <a name="The_characteristics59" id="The_characteristics59"></a>The characteristics of war as developed above
must help to decide the question whether so-called
civil wars are war in the technical meaning of the term.
It has already been stated above (in § <a href="#To_be_considered_war56">56</a>) that an armed
contention between member-States of a Federal State
and the latter and between a suzerain and its vassal
ought to be considered as war because both parties are
real States, although the Federal State as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
suzerain may correctly designate it as a rebellion.
Such armed contentions may be called civil wars in a
wider sense of the term. In the proper sense of the
term a civil war exists when two opposing parties within
a State have recourse to arms for the purpose of obtaining
power in the State, or when a large portion of the
population of a State rises in arms against the legitimate
Government. As war is an armed contention between
<i>States</i>, such a civil war need not be from the beginning,
nor become at all, war in the technical sense of the
term. But it may become war through the recognition
of each of the contending parties or of the insurgents
as the case may be, as a belligerent Power.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Through
this recognition a body of individuals receives an international
position in so far as it is for some parts and in
some points treated as though it were a subject<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> of
International Law. Such recognition may be granted
by the very State within the boundaries of which the
civil war broke out, and then other States will in most
cases, although they need not, likewise recognise a state
of war as existing and bear the duties of neutrality.
But it may happen that other States recognise insurgents
as a belligerent Power before the State on whose
territory the insurrection broke out so recognises them.
In such case the insurrection is war in the eyes of these
other States, but not in the eyes of the legitimate
Government.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Be that as it may, it must be specially
observed that, although a civil war becomes war in
the technical sense of the term by recognition, this
recognition has a lasting effect only when the insurgents
succeed in getting their independence established
through the defeat of the legitimate Government and a
consequent treaty of peace which recognises their independence.
Nothing, however, prevents the State concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
after the defeat of the insurgents and reconquest
of the territory which they had occupied, from treating
them as rebels according to the Criminal Law of the
land, for the character of a belligerent Power received
through recognition is lost <i>ipso facto</i> by their defeat
and the re-occupation by the legitimate Government
of the territory occupied by them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Guerilla
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 60. <a name="The_characteristics60" id="The_characteristics60"></a>The characteristics of war as developed
above are also decisive for the answer to the question
whether so-called guerilla war is real war in the technical
sense of the term. Such guerilla war must not be confounded
with guerilla tactics during a war. It happens
during war that the commanders send small bodies of
soldiers wearing their uniform to the rear of the enemy
for the purpose of destroying bridges and railways,
cutting off communications and supplies, attacking
convoys, intercepting despatches, and the like. This is
in every way legal, and the members of such bodies,
when captured, enjoy the treatment due to enemy
soldiers. It happens, further, that hitherto private
individuals who did not take part in the armed contention
take up arms and devote themselves mainly
to similar tactics. According to the former rules of
International Law such individuals, when captured,
under no condition enjoyed the treatment due to enemy
soldiers, but could be treated as criminals and punished
with death. According to article 1 of the Regulations
concerning war on land adopted by the Hague Conferences
of 1899 and 1907 such guerilla fighters enjoy
the treatment of soldiers under the four conditions
that they (1) do not act individually, but form a body
commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates,
(2) have a fixed distinctive emblem recognisable
at a distance, (3) carry arms openly, and (4) conduct
their operations in accordance with the laws of war.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> See also
article 2 of the Hague Regulations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p></div>

<p>On the other hand, one speaks of guerilla war or
petty war when, after the defeat and the capture of
the main part of the enemy forces, the occupation of
the enemy territory, and the downfall of the enemy
Government, the routed remnants of the defeated
army carry on the contention by mere guerilla tactics.
Although hopeless of success in the end, such petty
war can go on for a long time thus preventing the
establishment of a state of peace in spite of the fact that
regular war is over and the task of the army of occupation
is no longer regular warfare. Now the question
whether such guerilla war is real war in the strict
sense of the term in International Law must, I think,
be answered in the negative, for two reasons. First,
there are no longer the forces of two States in the
field, because the defeated belligerent State has ceased
to exist through the military occupation of its territory,
the downfall of its established Government, the capture
of the main part and the routing of the remnant of its
forces. And, secondly, there is no longer in progress
a contention between armed forces. For although the
guerilla bands are still fighting when attacked, or when
attacking small bodies of enemy soldiers, they try to
avoid a pitched battle, and content themselves with
the constant harassing of the victorious army, the destroying
of bridges and railways, cutting off communications
and supplies, attacking convoys, and the like,
always in the hope that some event or events may
occur which will induce the victorious army to withdraw
from the conquered territory. But if guerilla
war is not real war, it is obvious that in strict law the
victor need no longer treat the guerilla bands as a
belligerent Power and the captured members of those
bands as soldiers. It is, however, not advisable that
the victor should cease such treatment as long as those
bands are under responsible commanders and observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
themselves the laws and usages of war. For I can see
no advantage or reason why, although in strict law
it could be done, those bands should be treated as
criminals. Such treatment would only call for acts
of revenge on their part, without in the least accelerating
the pacification of the country. And it is, after all,
to be taken into consideration that those bands act
not out of criminal but patriotic motives. With patience
and firmness the victor will succeed in pacifying these
bands without recourse to methods of harshness.</p>

has broken out, and whether or no the cause be a
so-called just cause, the same rules of International
Law are valid as to what must not be done, may be
done, and must be done by the belligerents themselves
in making war against each other, and as between
the belligerents and neutral States. This being the
case, the question as to the causes of war is of minor
importance for the Law of Nations, although not for
international ethics. The matter need not be discussed

determine and define just causes of war. It must,
however, be emphasised that this is by no means the

<p>§ 62. The causes of war are innumerable. They
are involved in the fact that the development of mankind
is indissolubly connected with the national development
of States. The millions of individuals who
as a body are called mankind do not face one another
individually and severally, but in groups as races,
nations, and States. With the welfare of the races,
nations, and States to which they belong the welfare
of individuals is more or less identified. And it is the
development of races, nations, and States that carries
with it the causes of war. A constant increase of
population must in the end force upon a State the
necessity of acquiring more territory, and if such
territory cannot be acquired by peaceable means,
acquisition by conquest alone remains. At certain
periods of history the principle of nationality and the
desire for national unity gain such a power over the
hearts and minds of the individuals belonging to the
same race or nation, but living within the boundaries of
several different States, that wars break out for the
cause of national unity and independence. And jealous
rivalry between two or more States, the awakening of
national ambition, the craving for rich colonies, the
desire of a land-locked State for a sea coast, the endeavour
of a hitherto minor State to become a world-Power,
the ambition of dynasties or of great politicians
to extend and enlarge their influence beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
boundaries of their own State, and innumerable other
factors, have been at work ever since history was first
recorded in creating causes of war, and these factors
likewise play their part in our own times. Although
one must hope that the time will come when war will
entirely disappear, there is no possibility of seeing this
hope realised in the near future. The first necessities
of the disappearance of war are that the surface of the
earth should be shared between States of the same
standard of civilisation, and that the moral ideas of the
governing classes in all the States of the world should
undergo such an alteration and progressive development
as would create the conviction that decisions of
international courts of justice and awards of arbitrators
are alone adequate means for the settlement of international
disputes and international political aims. So
long as these first necessities are not realised, war will
as heretofore remain the <i>ultima ratio</i> of international
politics.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Just
Causes of
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 63. However this may be, it often depends largely
upon the standpoint from which they are viewed
whether or no causes of war are to be called just causes.
A war may be just or unjust from the standpoint of
both belligerents, or just from the standpoint of one
and utterly unjust from the standpoint of the other.
The assertion that whereas all wars waged for political
causes are unjust, all wars waged for international
delinquencies are just, if there be no other way of
getting reparation and satisfaction, is certainly incorrect
because too sweeping. The evils of war are so
great that, even when caused by an international delinquency,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
war cannot be justified if the delinquency
be comparatively unimportant and trifling. And, on
the other hand, under certain circumstances and conditions
many political causes of war may correctly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
called just causes. Only such individuals as lack insight
into history and human nature can, for instance,
defend the opinion that a war is unjust which has been
caused by the desire for national unity or by the desire
to maintain the balance of power which under the
present conditions and circumstances is the basis of
all International Law. Necessity for a war implies
its justification, whatever may be the cause. In the
past many wars have undoubtedly been waged which
were unjust from whatever standpoint they may be
viewed. Yet the number of wars diminishes gradually
every year, and the majority of the European wars since
the downfall of Napoleon I. were wars that were, from
the standpoint of at any rate one of the belligerents,
necessary and therefore just wars.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> See
 above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#International_delinquency151">vol. I. §§ 151</a>-156.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Causes in
contradistinction
to Pretexts
for
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 64. Be that as it may, causes of war must not be
confounded with pretexts for war. A State which
makes war against another will never confess that
there is no just cause for war, and it will therefore,
when it has made up its mind to make war for political
reasons, always look out for a so-called just cause.
Thus frequently the apparent reason of a war is only
a pretext behind which the real cause is concealed. If
two States are convinced that war between them is
inevitable, and if consequently they face each other
armed to the teeth, they will find at the suitable time
many a so-called just cause plausible and calculated
to serve as a pretext for the outbreak of the war which
was planned and resolved upon long ago. The skill of
politics and diplomacy are nowhere more needed than
on the occasion of a State's conviction that it must go
to war for one reason or another. Public opinion at
home and abroad is often not ripe to appreciate the
reason and not prepared for the scheme of the leading
politicians, whose task it is to realise their plans with
the aid of pretexts which appear as the cause of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
whereas the real cause does not become apparent for
some time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Different

<p>§ 65. Such writers on International Law as lay
great stress upon the causes of war in general and upon
the distinction between just causes and others, also lay
great stress upon the distinction between different
kinds of war. But as the rules of the Law of Nations
are the same<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> for the different kinds of war that may
be distinguished, this distinction is in most cases of no
importance. Apart from that, there is no unanimity
respecting the kinds of war, and it is apparent that,
just as the causes of war are innumerable, so innumerable
kinds of war can be distinguished. Thus one
speaks of offensive and defensive, or religious, political,
dynastic, national, civil wars; of wars of unity, independence,
conquest, intervention, revenge, and of
many other kinds. As the very name which each
different kind of war bears always explains its character
no further details are necessary respecting kinds
of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Ends of
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 66. <a name="The_cause_or_causes66" id="The_cause_or_causes66"></a>The cause or causes of a war determine at its
inception the ends of such war. The ends of war must
not be confounded with the purpose of war.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Whereas
the purpose of war is always the same&mdash;namely, the
overpowering and utter defeat of the opponent&mdash;the
ends of war may be different in each case. Ends of
war are those objects for the realisation of which a war
is made.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> In the beginning of the war its ends are
determined by its cause or causes, as already said.
But these ends may undergo alteration, or at least
modification, with the progress and development of the
war. No moral or legal duty exists for a belligerent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
to stop the war when his opponent is ready to concede
the object for which war was made. If war has once
broken out the very national existence of the belligerents
is more or less at stake. The risk the belligerents
run, the exertion they make, the blood and
wealth they sacrifice, the reputation they gain or lose
through the changing fortune and chances of war&mdash;all
these and many other factors work or may work together
to influence the ends of a war so that eventually
there is scarcely any longer a relation between them
and the causes of the war. If war really were, as some
writers maintain,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> the legal remedy of self-help to
obtain satisfaction for a wrong sustained from another
State, no such alteration of the ends of war could
take place without at once setting in the wrong such
belligerent as changes the ends for which the war
was initiated. But history shows that nothing of the
kind is really the case, and the existing rules of International
Law by no means forbid such alteration or
modification of the ends of a war. This alteration
or modification of the ends is the result of an alteration
or modification of circumstances created during the
progress of war through the factors previously mentioned;
it could not be otherwise, and there is no
moral, legal, or political reason why it should be otherwise.
And the natural jealousy between the members
of the Family of Nations, their conflicting interests in
many points, and the necessity of a balance of power,
are factors of sufficient strength to check the political
dangers which such alteration of the ends of a war
may eventually involve.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Origin of
the Laws
of War.</p></div>

<p>§ 67. <a name="Laws_of_War67" id="Laws_of_War67"></a>Laws of War are the rules of the Law of
Nations respecting warfare. The roots of the present
Laws of War are to be traced back to practices of
belligerents which arose and grew gradually during
the latter part of the Middle Ages. The unsparing
cruelty of the war practices during the greater part
of the Middle Ages began gradually to be modified
through the influence of Christianity and chivalry.
And although these practices were cruel enough during
the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries,
they were mild compared with those of still earlier
times. Decided progress was made during the eighteenth,
and again during the nineteenth century, after
the close of the Napoleonic wars, especially in the years
from 1850 to 1900. The laws of war evolved in this
way: isolated milder practices became by-and-by
usages, so-called <i>usus in bello</i>, manner of warfare,
<i>Kriegs-Manier</i>, and these usages through custom and
treaties turned into legal rules. And this evolution
is constantly going on, for, besides the recognised
Laws of War, there are usages in existence which have
a tendency to become gradually legal rules of warfare.
The whole growth of the laws and usages of war is
determined by three principles. There is, first, the
principle that a belligerent should be justified in applying
any amount and any kind of force which is necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
for the realisation of the purpose of war&mdash;namely, the
overpowering of the opponent. There is, secondly, the
principle of humanity at work, which says that all such
kinds and degrees of violence as are not necessary for
the overpowering of the opponent should not be permitted
to a belligerent. And, thirdly and lastly, there
is at work the principle of chivalry which arose in the
Middle Ages and introduced a certain amount of fairness
in offence and defence, and a certain mutual respect.
And, in contradistinction to the savage cruelty
of former times, belligerents have in modern times
come to the conviction that the realisation of the
purpose of war is in no way hampered by indulgence
shown to the wounded, the prisoners, and the private
individuals who do not take part in the fighting. Thus
the influence of the principle of humanity has been
and is still enormous upon the practice of warfare.
And the methods of warfare, although by the nature
of war to a certain degree cruel and unsparing, become
less cruel and more humane every day. But it must
be emphasised that the whole evolution of the laws and
usages of war could not have taken place but for the
institution of standing armies, which dates from the
fifteenth century. The humanising of the practices
of war would have been impossible without the discipline
of standing armies; and the important distinction
between members of armed forces and private
individuals could not have arisen without the existence
of standing armies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The latest
Development
of
the Laws
of War.</p></div>

<p>§ 68. <a name="Th68" id="Th68"></a>The latest and the most important development
of the Laws of War was produced through general
treaties concluded between the majority of States
since the beginning of the second part of the nineteenth
century. The following are the treaties concerned:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The Declaration of Paris of April 16, 1856, respecting
warfare on sea. It abolishes privateering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
recognises the principles that the neutral flag covers
enemy goods and that neutral goods under an enemy
flag cannot be seized, and enacts the rule that a blockade
in order to be binding must be effective. The Declaration
is signed by seven States, but eighteen others
acceded in course of time.</p>

<p>(2) The Geneva Convention of August 22, 1864, for
the amelioration of the condition of wounded soldiers
in armies in the field, which originally was signed by
only nine States, but to which in course of time all the
civilised States&mdash;except Costa-Rica, Lichtenstein, and
Monaco!&mdash;have acceded. A treaty containing a
number of additional articles to the Convention was
signed at Geneva on October 20, 1868, but was never
ratified. A new Geneva Convention was signed on
July 6, 1906, by thirty-five States, and several others
have already acceded. There is no doubt that the
whole civilised world will soon be a party to this new
Geneva Convention. The principles of the Geneva
Convention were adapted to maritime warfare by
Conventions (see below, <a href="#The_Con68no8">No. 8</a>) of the First and Second
Hague Peace Conferences.</p>

<p>(3) The Declaration of St. Petersburg of December
11, 1868, respecting the prohibition of the use in war
of projectiles under 400 grammes (14 ounces) which are
either explosive or charged with inflammable substances.
It is signed by seventeen States.</p>

<p>(4) The Convention enacting "Regulations respecting
the Laws of War on Land," agreed upon at the
First Peace Conference of 1899.</p>

<p>The history of this Convention may be traced back
to the <i>Instructions for the Government of Armies
of the United States in the Field</i> which the United
States published on April 14, 1863, during the War of
Secession. These instructions, which were drafted by
Professor Francis Lieber, of the Columbia College of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
New York, represent the first endeavour to codify the
Laws of War, and they are even nowadays of great
value and importance. In 1874 an International Conference,
invited by the Emperor Alexander II. of
Russia, met at Brussels for the purpose of discussing
a draft code of the Laws of War on Land as prepared by
Russia. The body of the articles agreed upon at this
Conference, and known as the "Brussels Declarations,"
have, however, never become law, as ratification was
never given by the Powers. But the Brussels Declarations
were made the basis of deliberations on the
part of the Institute of International Law, which at
its meeting at Oxford in 1880 adopted a Manual<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> of the
Laws of War consisting of a body of 86 rules under the
title <i>Les Lois de la Guerre sur Terre</i>, and a copy of
this draft code was sent to all the Governments of
Europe and America. It was, however, not until the
Hague Peace Conference of 1899 that the Powers reassembled
to discuss again the codification of the Laws
of War. At this Conference the Brussels Declarations
were taken as the basis of the deliberations; but
although the bulk of its articles was taken over, several
important modifications were introduced in the Convention,
which was finally agreed upon and ratified,
only a few Powers abstaining from ratification.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_81_81" id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> See
<i>Annuaire</i>, V. pp. 157-174.</p></div>

<p>The Second Peace Conference of 1907 has revised
this Convention, and its place is now taken by Convention
IV. of the Second Peace Conference. The
Convention,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> as the preamble expressly states, does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
aim at giving a complete code of the Laws of War on
Land, and cases beyond its scope still remain the subject
of customary rules and usages. Further, it does not
create universal International Law, as article 2 of the
Convention expressly stipulates that the Regulations
shall be binding upon the contracting Powers only in
case of war between two or more of them, and shall
cease to be binding in case a non-contracting Power
takes part in the war. But, in spite of this express
stipulation, there can be no doubt that in time the
Regulations will become universal International Law.
For all the Powers represented at the Second Peace
Conference signed the Convention, except China, Spain,
and Nicaragua, although some States made certain
reservations. Nicaragua has since acceded, and it is
certain that the outstanding States will in time also
accede.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_82_82" id="Footnote_82_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> For brevity's sake the Hague Convention enacting
Regulations regarding the laws and customs of war on land will be
referred to in the following pages as the <i>Hague Regulations</i>. It is,
however, of importance to observe that the Hague Regulations, although
they are intended to be binding upon the belligerents, are only the
basis upon which the signatory Powers have to frame instructions for
their forces. Article 1 declares: "The high contracting parties shall
issue instructions to their armed land forces, which shall be in
conformity with the Regulations respecting the Laws of War on Land
annexed to the present Convention." The British War Office, therefore,
published in 1912, a guide, <i>Land Warfare: an Exposition of the Laws and
Usages of War on Land for the Guidance of Officers of His Majesty's
Army</i>, written by order of His Majesty's Secretary of War by Colonel
Edmonds and Professor Oppenheim, in which the Hague Regulations are
systematically set out; their full text is published in Appendix 6 of
the guide. But it should be mentioned that the British War Office had
already in 1903 published a manual, drafted with great precision and
clearness by Professor Holland, for the information of the British
forces, comprising "The Laws and Customs of War on Land, as defined by
the Hague Convention of 1899." See also Holland, <i>The Laws of War on
Land (Written and Unwritten)</i>, Oxford, 1908.</p></div>

published on June 27, 1900, a body of rules for the use of her navy
under the title <i>The Laws and Usages of War on Sea</i>&mdash;the so-called
"United States Naval War Code." This code, although withdrawn on
February 4, 1904, will undoubtedly be the starting-point of a movement
for a Naval War Code to be generally agreed upon by the Powers. See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Binding
force of
the Laws
of War</p></div>

<p>§ 69. As soon as usages of warfare have by custom
or treaty evolved into laws of war, they are binding
upon belligerents under all circumstances and conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
except in the case of reprisals<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> as retaliation
against a belligerent for illegitimate acts of warfare by
the members of his armed forces or his other subjects.
In accordance with the German proverb, <i>Kriegsraeson
geht vor Kriegsmanier</i> (<i>necessity in war overrules the
manner of warfare</i>), many German authors<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and the
Swiss-Belgian Rivier<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> maintain that the laws of war
lose their binding force in case of extreme necessity.
Such case of extreme necessity is said to have arisen
when violation of the laws of war alone offers either a
means of escape from extreme danger or the realisation
of the purpose of war&mdash;namely, the overpowering of
the opponent. This alleged exception to the binding
force of the Laws of War, is, however, not at all
generally accepted by German writers, for instance,
Bluntschli does not mention it. English, American,
French, and Italian writers do not, so far as I am
aware, acknowledge it. The protest of Westlake,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
therefore, against such an exception is the more justified,
as a great danger would be involved by its admission.</p>

<p>The proverb dates very far back in the history of
warfare. It originated and found recognition in those
times when warfare was not regulated by laws of war&mdash;that
is universally binding customs and international
treaties, but only by usages (<i>Manier, i.e. Brauch</i>), and it
says that necessity in war overrules usages of warfare.
In our days, however, warfare is no longer regulated
by usages only, but to a greater extent by laws, firm
rules recognised either by international treaties or by
universal custom.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> These conventional and customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
rules cannot be overruled by necessity, unless they are
framed in such a way as not to apply to a case of
necessity in self-preservation. Thus, for instance, the
rules that poisoned arms and poison are forbidden, and
that it is not allowed treacherously to kill or wound
individuals belonging to the hostile army, do not lose
their binding force even if escape from extreme danger
or the realisation of the purpose of war would result
from an act of this kind. Article 22 of the Hague Rules
stipulates distinctly that the right of belligerents to
adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited,
and this rule does not lose its binding force in a case of
necessity. What may be ignored in case of military
necessity are not the laws of war, but only the usages
of war. <i>Kriegsraeson geht vor Kriegsmanier</i>, but not
<i>vor Kriegsrecht</i>!</p>

<p>§ 70. <a name="Region_of_war70" id="Region_of_war70"></a>Region of war is that part of the surface of
the earth in which the belligerents may prepare and
execute hostilities against each other. In this meaning
region of war ought<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> to be distinguished from
theatre of war. The latter is that part of a territory
or the Open Sea on which hostilities actually take
place. Legally no part of the earth which is not region
of war may be made the theatre of war, but not every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
section of the whole region of war is necessarily theatre
of war. Thus, in the war between Great Britain and the
two South African Republics the whole of the territory
of the British Empire and the Open Sea, as well as the
territory of the Republics, was the region of war, but
the theatre of war was in South Africa only. On the
other hand, in a war between Great Britain and another
great naval Power it might well happen that the region
of war is in many of its sections made the theatre of war.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_89_89" id="Footnote_89_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> This distinction, although of considerable importance, does
not appear to have been made by any other publicist.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Particular

<p>§ 71. <a name="The_region_of_war71" id="The_region_of_war71"></a>The region of war depends upon the belligerents.
For this reason every war has its particular
region, so far at any rate as territorial region is concerned.
For besides the Open Sea<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and all such territories
as are as yet not occupied by any State, which
are always within the region of war, the particular
region of every war is the whole of the territories and
territorial waters of the belligerents. It must, however,
be specially observed that any part of the globe
which is permanently neutralised,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> is always exempt
from the region of war.</p>

<p>Since colonies are a part of the territory of the
mother country, they fall within the region of war in
the case of a war between the mother country and
another State, whatever their position may be within
the colonial empire they belong to. Thus in a war
between Great Britain and France the whole of
Australia, of Canada, of India, and so on, would be included
with the British Islands as region of war. And,
further, as States under the suzerainty of another State
are internationally in several respects considered to be
a portion of the latter's territory,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> they fall within the
region of war in case of war between the suzerain and
another Power. Again, such parts of the territory of
a State as are under the <i>condominium</i> or under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
administration of another State<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> fall within the region
of war in case of war between one of the <i>condomini</i>
and another Power and in case of war between the administrating
State and another State. Thus, in a war
between Great Britain and another Power, Cyprus
would fall within the region of war; and the Soudan,
which is in the <i>condominium</i> of England and Egypt,
would likewise do so. On the other hand, Cyprus
would not fall within the region of war in the case of war
between Turkey and another Power, Great Britain
excepted.</p>

<p>Although as a rule the territories of both belligerents,
together with the Open Sea, fall within the region of
war, and neutral territories do not, exceptions to the
rule may occur:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A belligerent can deliberately treat certain
territories which legally fall within the region of war,
as well as parts of the Open Sea, as though they were
not parts of the region of war, provided that such
territories on their part fulfil the duties incumbent
upon neutrals. Thus during the Turco-Italian War
in 1911 and 1912, Italy treated Crete and Egypt as
though they were not parts of the region of war.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>(2) Cases are possible in which a part or the whole
of the territory of a neutral State falls within the
region of war. These cases arise in wars in which such
neutral territories are the very objects of the war, as
Korea, which was at that time an independent State,
and the Chinese province of Manchuria<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> were in the
Russo-Japanese War of 1904 and 1905. Such a case
may also occur if an army of one of the belligerents
crosses the frontier of a neutral State, but is not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
once disarmed and interned, and is, therefore, able at
any moment to recross the frontier and attack the other
belligerent.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Since necessity of self-preservation can
compel the latter on his part also to cross the neutral
frontier and pursue and attack the enemy on neutral
territory, the part of such neutral territory concerned
would for this reason become part of the region
of war.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_94_94" id="Footnote_94_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> There is no doubt that this attitude of Italy is explained
by the fact that Egypt, although legally under Turkish suzerainty, is
actually under British occupation, and that Crete is forcibly kept by
the Powers under Turkish suzerainty.</p></div>

<p>§ 72. <a name="Although_the_Open_Sea72" id="Although_the_Open_Sea72"></a>Although the Open Sea in its whole extent
and the whole of the territories of the belligerents are
as a rule within the region of war, certain parts can
be excluded through neutralisation. Such neutralisation
can take place permanently through a general
treaty of the Powers or temporarily through a special
treaty of the belligerents. At present no part of the
Open Sea is neutralised, as the neutralisation of the
Black Sea was abolished<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> in 1871. But the following
are some important instances<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> of permanent neutralisation
of parts of territories:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The former Sardinian, but since 1860 French,
provinces of Chablais and Faucigny<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> are permanently
neutralised through article 92 of the Act of the Vienna
Congress, 1815.</p>

<p>(2) The Ionian Islands through article 2 of the
Treaty of London of November 14, 1863, are permanently
neutralised since they merged in the kingdom
of Greece. But this neutralisation was restricted<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> to
the islands of Corfu and Paxo only by article 2 of the
treaty of London of March 24, 1864.</p>

<p>(3) The Suez Canal is permanently neutralised<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
since 1888.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) The Straits of Magellan<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> are permanently
neutralised through article 5 of the boundary treaty
of Buenos Ayres of July 23, 1881. But this treaty
is not a general treaty of the Powers, since it is concluded
between Argentina and Chili only.</p>

<p>(5) The Panama<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Canal is permanently neutralised
through article 3 of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of
November 18, 1901. But this treaty is not a general
treaty of the Powers either, being concluded between
only Great Britain and the United States.</p>

<p>(6) A piece of territory along the frontier between
Sweden and Norway is neutralised by the Convention of
Stockholm of October 26, 1905, which includes rules
concerning a neutral zone.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> But this is a neutralisation
agreed upon between Sweden and Norway only,
no third Power has anything to do with it, and even
the contracting Powers stipulate&mdash;see article 1, last
paragraph&mdash;that the neutralisation shall not be valid
in the case of a war against a common enemy.</p>

<p>As regards temporary neutralisation, it is possible
for parts of the territories of belligerents and certain
parts of the Open Sea to become neutralised through
a treaty of the belligerents for the time of a particular
war only. Thus, when in 1870 war broke out between
France and Germany, the commander of the French
man-of-war<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> <i>Dupleix</i> arranged with the commander
of the German man-of-war <i>Hertha</i>&mdash;both stationed in
the Japanese and Chinese waters&mdash;that they should,
through their embassies in Yokohama, propose to their
respective Governments the neutralisation of the
Japanese and Chinese waters for the time of the war.
Germany consented, but France refused the neutralisation.
Again, at the commencement of the Turco-Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
War in 1911, Turkey proposed the neutralisation
of the Red Sea, but Italy refused to agree to it.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_105_105" id="Footnote_105_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_105_105"><span class="label">[105]</span></a> See

<p>§ 73. That there is at present no part of the Open

applies to the Baltic Sea, which is admittedly part
of the Open Sea. Some writers,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> however, maintain
that the littoral States of the Baltic have a right to
forbid all hostilities within the Baltic in case of a
war between other States than themselves, and could
thereby neutralise the Baltic without the consent and
even against the will of the belligerents. This opinion
is based on the fact that during the eighteenth century
the littoral States of the Baltic claimed that right in
several conventions, but it appears untenable, because
it is opposed to the universally recognised principle
of the freedom of the Open Sea. As no State has
territorial supremacy over parts of the Open Sea, I
cannot see how such a right of the littoral States of
the Baltic could be justified.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>§ 74. As the Law of Nations recognises the status
of war and its effects as regards rights and duties
between the two or more belligerents on the one hand,
and, on the other, between the belligerents and neutral
States, the question arises what kind of States are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
legally qualified to make war and to become thereby
belligerents. Publicists who discuss this question at
all speak mostly of a <i>right</i> of States to make war, a
<i>jus belli</i>. But if this so-called right is examined, it
turns out to be no right at all, as there is no corresponding
duty in those against whom the right is said
to exist.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> A State which makes war against another
exercises one of its natural functions, and the only
question is whether such State is or is not legally
qualified to exercise such function. Now, according
to the Law of Nations full-Sovereign States alone
possess the legal qualification to become belligerents;
half-and part-Sovereign States are not legally qualified
to become belligerents. Since neutralised States,
as Switzerland, Belgium, and Luxemburg, are full-Sovereign
States, they are legally qualified to become
belligerents, although their neutralisation binds them
not to make use of their qualification except for defence.
If they become belligerents because they are
attacked, they do not lose their character as neutralised
States, but if they become belligerents for offensive

<p>§ 75. <a name="Such_States_as_do75" id="Such_States_as_do75"></a>Such States as do not possess the legal qualification
to become belligerents are by law prohibited
from offensive or defensive warfare. But the possession
of armed forces makes it possible for them in
fact to enter into war and to become belligerents.
History records instances enough of such States having
actually made war. Thus in 1876 Servia and Montenegro,
although at that time vassal States under
Turkish suzerainty, declared war against Turkey, and
in March 1877, peace was concluded between Turkey
and Servia.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> And when in April 1877 war broke out
between Russia and Turkey, the then Turkish vassal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
State Roumania joined Russia, and Servia declared
war anew against Turkey in December 1877. Further
in November 1885 a war was waged between Servia,
which had become a full-Sovereign State, and Bulgaria,
which was at the time still a vassal State under Turkish
suzerainty; the war lasted actually only a fortnight,
but the formal treaty of peace was not signed until
March 3, 1886, at Bukarest.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> And although Turkey is
a party to this treaty, Bulgaria appears as a party
thereto independently and on its own behalf.</p>

<p>§ 77. <a name="War_occurs_usually77" id="War_occurs_usually77"></a>War occurs usually between two States, one
belligerent party being on each side. But there are
cases in which there are on one or on both sides several
parties, and in some of such cases principal and accessory
belligerent parties are to be distinguished.</p>

<p>Principal belligerent parties are those parties to
a war who wage it on the basis of a treaty of alliance,
whether such treaty was concluded before or during
the war. On the other hand, accessory belligerent
parties are such States as provide help and succour only
in a limited way to a principal belligerent party at war
with another State; for instance, by paying subsidies,
sending a certain number of troops or men-of-war to
take part in the contention, granting a coaling station
to the men-of-war of the principal party, allowing the
latter's troops a passage through their territory, and
the like. Such accessory party becomes a belligerent
through rendering help.</p>

<p>The matter need hardly be mentioned at all were
it not for the fact that the question was formerly discussed
by publicists whether or not it involved a violation
of neutrality on the part of a neutral State in case
it fulfilled in time of war a treaty concluded in time of
peace, by the terms of which it had to grant a coaling
station, the passage of troops through its territory, and
the like, to one of the belligerents. This question is
identical with the question, to be treated below in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
§ <a href="#A_distinction_of305">305</a>, whether a qualified neutrality, in contradistinction
to a perfect neutrality, is admissible. Since the
answer to this question is in the negative, such State as
fulfils a treaty obligation of this kind in time of war
may be considered by the other side an accessory belligerent
party to the war, and all doubt in the matter
ought now to be removed since article 2 of Convention
V. of the Second Peace Conference<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> categorically

kinds of forces constitute a regular army and a regular
navy is not for International Law to determine, but a
matter of Municipal Law exclusively. Whether or
not so-called Militia and Volunteer corps belong to
armies rests entirely with the Municipal Law of the
belligerents. There are several States whose armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
consist of Militia and Volunteer Corps exclusively, no
standing army being provided for. The Hague Regulations
expressly stipulate in article 1 that in countries
where Militia or Volunteer Corps constitute the army
or form part of it they are included under the denomination
"Army." It is likewise irrelevant to
consider the composition of a regular army, whether
it is based on conscription or not, whether natives

<p>Writers on the Law of Nations do not agree as

not mere private individuals, but, on the other hand,
are certainly not combatants, although they may&mdash;as,
for instance, couriers, doctors, farriers, and veterinary
surgeons&mdash;have the character of soldiers. They may
correctly be said to belong <i>indirectly</i> to the armed
forces. Article 3 of the Hague Regulations expressly
stipulates that the armed forces of the belligerents
may consist of combatants and non-combatants, and
that both in case of capture must be treated as prisoners
of war, provided<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> they produce a certificate of identification

<p>§ 80. <a name="Very_often_the_armed80" id="Very_often_the_armed80"></a>Very often the armed forces of belligerents
consist throughout the war of their regular armies
only, but, on the other hand, it happens frequently
that irregular forces take part in the war. Of such
irregular forces there are two different kinds to be
distinguished&mdash;first, such as are authorised by the
belligerents; and, secondly, such as are acting on
their own initiative and their own account without
special authorisation. Formerly it was a recognised
rule of International Law that only the members of
authorised irregular forces enjoyed the privileges due
to the members of the armed forces of belligerents,
whereas members of unauthorised irregular forces were
considered to be war criminals and could be shot when
captured. During the Franco-German war in 1870
the Germans acted throughout according to this rule
with regard to the so-called "Franctireurs," requesting
the production of a special authorisation from the
French Government from every irregular combatant
they captured, failing which he was shot. But according
to article 1 of the Hague Regulations this rule is
now obsolete, and its place is taken by the rule that
irregulars enjoy the privileges due to members of the
armed forces of the belligerents, although they do not
act under authorisation, provided (1) that they are
commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates,
(2) that they have a fixed distinctive emblem recognisable
at a distance,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
(3) that they carry arms
openly,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>(4) that they conduct their operations in accordance
with the laws and customs of war. It must,
however, be emphasised that this rule applies only to
irregulars fighting in bodies, however small. Such individuals
as take up arms or commit hostile acts singly
and severally are still liable to be treated as war
criminals, and shot.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

undetermined. See <i>Land Warfare</i>, § 23, where it is pointed out that it
is reasonable to expect that the silhouette of an irregular combatant in
the position of standing against the skyline should be at once
distinguishable from the outline of a peaceable inhabitant, and this by
the naked eye of ordinary individuals, at a distance at which the form
of an individual can be determined.&mdash;See Ariga, p. 87, concerning 120
irregulars who were treated as criminals and shot by the Japanese after
the occupation of Vladimirowka on the island of Sakhaline.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Levies <i>en
masse</i>.</p></div>

<p>§ 81. <a name="It_sometimes81" id="It_sometimes81"></a>It sometimes happens during war that on the
approach of the enemy a belligerent calls the whole
population of the country to arms and thus makes
them a part, although a more or less irregular part, of
his armed forces. Provided they receive some organisation
and comply with the laws and usages of war, the
combatants who take part in such a levy <i>en masse</i>
organised by the State enjoy the privileges due to
members of armed forces.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, further, during wars, that
a levy <i>en masse</i> takes place spontaneously without
organisation by a belligerent, and the question arises
whether or not those who take part in such levies <i>en
masse</i> belong to the armed forces of the belligerents,
and therefore enjoy the privileges due to members
of such forces. Article 2 of the Hague Regulations
stipulates that the population of a territory not yet
occupied who, on the enemy's approach, spontaneously
take up arms to resist the invading enemy, without
having time to organise themselves under responsible
commanders and to procure fixed distinctive emblems
recognisable at a distance, shall nevertheless enjoy the
privileges due to armed forces, provided that they
carry arms openly and act otherwise in conformity
with the laws and usages of war. But this case is
totally different from a levy <i>en masse</i> of the population
of a territory already invaded by the enemy, for the
purpose of freeing the country from the invader. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
stipulation of the Hague Regulations quoted above
does not cover this case, in which, therefore, the old
customary rule of International Law is valid, that
those taking part in such a levy <i>en masse</i>, if captured,
are liable to be shot.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

below, § <a href="#Since_International_Law254">254</a>. Article 85 of the American <i>Instructions
for the Government of Armies in the Field</i> of 1863 has enacted this rule
as follows: "War rebels are persons within an occupied territory who
rise in arms against the occupying or conquering army, or against the
authorities established by the same. If captured, they may suffer death,
whether they rise singly, in small or large bands, and whether called
upon to do so by their own, but expelled Government or not...."</p></div>

<p>It is of particular importance not to confound
invasion with occupation in this matter. Article 2
distinctly speaks of the <i>approach</i> of the enemy, and
thereby sanctions only such a levy <i>en masse</i> as takes
place in territory not yet <i>invaded</i> by the enemy. Once
the territory is invaded, although the invasion has not
yet ripened into occupation,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> a levy <i>en masse</i> is no
longer legitimate. But, of course, the term <i>territory</i>,
as used by article 2, is not intended to mean<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> the whole
extent of the State of a belligerent, but refers only to
such parts of it as are not yet invaded. For this
reason, if a town is already invaded, but not a neighbouring
town, the inhabitants of the latter may, on
the approach of the enemy, legitimately rise <i>en masse</i>.
And it matters not whether the individuals taking part
in the levy <i>en masse</i> are acting in immediate combination
with a regular army or separately from it.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>§ 82. As International Law grew up amongst the
States of Christendom, and as the circle of the members
of the Family of Nations includes only civilised, although
not necessarily Christian, States, all writers on International
Law agree that in wars between themselves
the members of the Family of Nations should not make
use of barbarous forces&mdash;that is, troops consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
individuals belonging to savage tribes and barbarous
races. But it can hardly be maintained that a rule of
this kind has customarily grown up in practice, nor has
it been stipulated by treaties, and the Hague Regulations
overlook this point. This being the fact, it is
difficult to say whether the members of such barbarous
forces, if employed in a war between members of the
Family of Nations, would enjoy the privileges due to
members of armed forces generally. I see no reason
why they should not, provided such barbarous forces
would or could comply with the laws and usages of
war prevalent according to International Law. But
the very fact that they are barbarians makes it probable
that they could or would not do so, and then it would be
unreasonable to grant them the privileges generally due
to members of armed forces, and it would be necessary
to treat them according to discretion.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> But it must be
specially observed that the employment of barbarous
forces must not be confounded with the enrolling of
coloured individuals into the regular army and the
employment of regiments consisting of disciplined
coloured soldiers. There is no reason whatever why,
for instance, the members of a regiment eventually
formed by the United States of America out of negroes
bred and educated in America, or why members of
Indian regiments under English commanders, if employed
in wars between members of the Family of
Nations, should not enjoy the privileges due to the
members of armed forces according to International Law.</p>

private vessels being commissioned by the belligerents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
through Letters of Marque to carry on hostilities at
sea, and particularly to capture enemy merchantmen.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
From the fifteenth century, when privateering began to
grow up, down to the eighteenth century, belligerents
used to grant such Letters of Marque to private ships
owned by their subjects and by the subjects of neutral
States. But during the eighteenth century the practice
grew up that belligerents granted Letters of Marque
to private ships of their own subjects only.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> However,
privateering was abolished by the Declaration of Paris
in 1856 as between the signatory Powers and others
who joined it later. And although privateering would
still be legal as between other Powers, it will in future
scarcely be made use of. In all the wars that occurred
after 1856 between such Powers, no Letters of Marque
were granted to private ships.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

great progress made by the abolition of privateering through the

note the fact that up to the present day endeavours have been made on
the part of freelances to win public opinion for a retrograde step. See,
for instance, Munro-Butler Johnstone, <i>Handbook of Maritime Rights; and
the Declaration of Paris Considered</i> (1876), and Gibson Bowles, <i>The
Declaration of Paris of 1856</i> (1900); see also Perels, pp. 177-179. The
Declaration of Paris being a law-making treaty which does not provide
the right of the several signatory Powers to give notice of withdrawal,
a signatory Power is not at liberty to give such notice, although Mr.
Gibson Bowles (<i>op. cit.</i> pp. 169-179) asserts that this could be done.

<p>§ 84. <a name="A_case_which_happened_in84" id="A_case_which_happened_in84"></a>A case which happened in 1870, soon after
the outbreak of the Franco-German war, gave occasion
for the question whether converted merchantmen
could be considered a part of the armed naval forces
of a belligerent. As the North-German Confederation
owned only a few men-of-war, the creation of a volunteer
fleet was intended. The King of Prussia, as President
of the Confederation, invited the owners of private
German vessels to make them a part of the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
navy under the following conditions: Every ship
should be assessed as to her value, and 10 per cent.
of such value should at once be paid in cash to the
owner as a price for the charter of the ship. The
owner should engage the crew himself, but the latter
should become for the time of the war members of the
German navy, wear the German naval uniform, and
the ship should sail under the German war flag and
be armed and adapted for her purpose by the German
naval authorities. Should the ship be captured or
destroyed by the enemy, the assessed value should be
paid to her owners in full; but should it be restored
after the war undamaged, the owner should retain the
10 per cent. received as charter price. All such vessels
should only try to capture or destroy French men-of-war,
and if successful the owner should receive
a sum between £1500 and £7500 as premium. The
French Government considered this scheme a disguised
evasion of the Declaration of Paris which
abolished privateering, and requested the intervention
of Great Britain. The British Government brought
the case before the Law Officers of the Crown, who
declared the German scheme to be substantially different
from the revival of privateering, and consequently
the British Government refused to object to
it. The scheme, however, was never put into practice.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

81-84.</p></div>

<p>Now, in spite of the opinion of the British Law
Officers, writers on International Law differ as to the
legality of the above scheme; but, on the other hand,
they are unanimous that not every scheme for a
voluntary fleet is to be rejected. Russia,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> in fact,
since 1877, has possessed a voluntary fleet. France<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>

constructed on plans approved by the Government,
have to be commanded by officers of the French navy,
and have to be incorporated in the French navy at the
outbreak of war. Great Britain from 1887 onwards has
entered into agreements with several powerful British
steamship companies for the purpose of securing their
vessels at the outbreak of hostilities; and the United
States of America in 1892 made similar arrangements
with the American Line.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Matters were brought to a climax in 1904, during
the Russo-Japanese War, through the cases of the
<i>Peterburg</i> and the <i>Smolensk</i>.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> On July 4 and 6 of that
year, these vessels, which belonged to the Russian
volunteer fleet in the Black Sea, were allowed to pass
the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, which are closed<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
to men-of-war of all nations, because they were flying
the Russian commercial flag. They likewise passed
the Suez Canal under their commercial flag, but after
leaving Suez they converted themselves into men-of-war
by hoisting the Russian war flag, and began to
exercise over neutral merchantmen all rights of supervision
which belligerents can claim for their cruisers
in time of war. On July 13 the <i>Peterburg</i> captured
the British P. &amp; O. steamer <i>Malacca</i> for alleged carriage
of contraband, and put a prize-crew on board for the
purpose of navigating her to Libau. But the British
Government protested; the <i>Malacca</i> was released at
Algiers on her way to Libau on July 27, and Russia
agreed that the <i>Peterburg</i> and the <i>Smolensk</i> should
no longer act as cruisers, and that all neutral vessels
captured by them should be released.</p>

<p>This case was the cause of the question of the
conversion of merchantmen into men-of-war being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
taken up by the Second Peace Conference in 1907,
which produced Convention VII. on the matter.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
This Convention, which is signed by all the States represented
at the Conference except the United States
of America, China, San Domingo, Nicaragua, and
Uruguay&mdash;but Nicaragua acceded later&mdash;comprises
twelve articles; its more important stipulations are the
following: No converted vessel can have the status
of a warship unless she is placed under the direct
authority, immediate control, and responsibility of the
Power whose flag she flies (article 1). Such a vessel
must, therefore, bear the external marks which distinguish
the warships of her nationality (article 2); the
commander must be in the service of the State concerned,
must be duly commissioned, and his name must
figure on the list of the officers of the military fleet
(article 3); and the crew must be subject to the rules
of military discipline (article 4). A converted vessel
must observe the laws and usages of war (article 5)
and her conversion must as soon as possible be announced
by the belligerent concerned in the list of the
ships of his military fleet (article 6).</p>

<p>The opinion, which largely prevails, that through
this admittance of the conversion of merchantmen
into men-of-war privateering has been revived, is absolutely
unfounded, for the rules stipulated by Convention
VII. in no way abrogate the rule of the Declaration
of Paris that privateering is and remains
abolished. But the Convention does not give satisfaction
in so far as it does not settle the questions
where the conversion of a vessel may be performed,
and whether it is permitted to reconvert, before the
termination of the war, into a merchantman a vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
which during the war had been converted into a warship.
The fact is, the Powers could not come to an
agreement on these two points, the one party claiming
that conversion could only be performed within a
harbour of the converting Power, or an enemy harbour
occupied by it, the other party defending the claim to
convert likewise on the High Seas. One must look
to the future for a compromise that will settle this
vexed controversy. It is, however, important to notice
the fact that the preamble of Convention VII. states
expressly that the question of the place where a conversion
may be performed remains open. Those Powers
which claim that conversions<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> must not take place on the
High Seas are not, therefore, prevented from refusing
to acknowledge the public character of any vessel
which had been converted on the High Seas, and from
upholding their view that a converted vessel may not
alternately claim the character and the privileges of a
belligerent man-of-war and a merchantman.</p>

<p>§ 85. <a name="In_a_sense_the_crews85" id="In_a_sense_the_crews85"></a>In a sense the crews of merchantmen owned
by subjects of the belligerents belong to the latter's
armed forces. For those vessels are liable to be seized
by enemy men-of-war, and if attacked for that purpose
they may defend themselves, may return the attack,
and eventually seize the attacking men-of-war. The
crews of merchantmen become in such cases combatants,
and enjoy all the privileges of the members
of armed forces. But unless attacked they must not
commit hostilities, and if they do so they are liable to
be treated as criminals just as are private individuals
who commit hostilities in land warfare. Some writers<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
assert that, although merchantmen of the belligerents
are not competent to exercise the right of visit, search,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>

enemy vessels&mdash;merchantmen as well as public vessels&mdash;not
merely in self-defence but even without having been
previously attacked, and that, consequently, the crews
must in such case enjoy the privileges due to members
of the armed forces. But this opinion is absolutely
without foundation nowadays,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> even in former times

<p>It should be mentioned in regard to the fate of the
crews of captured merchantmen that a distinction is to
be made according as to whether or no a vessel has
defended herself against a legitimate attack. In the

war, for by legitimately taking part in the fighting
they have become members of the armed forces of the
enemy.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> In the second case, articles 5 to 7 of Convention

<div class="sidenote"><p>On
Enemy
Character
in general.</p></div>

<p>§ 87. Since the belligerents, for the realisation of
the purpose of war, are entitled to many kinds of
measures against enemy persons and enemy property,
the question must be settled as to what persons and
what property are vested with enemy character.
Now it is, generally speaking, correct to say that,
whereas the subjects of the belligerents and the property
of such subjects bear enemy character, the subjects of
neutral States and the property of such subjects do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
not bear enemy character. This rule has, however,
important exceptions. For under certain circumstances
and conditions enemy persons and property of
enemy subjects may not bear, and, on the other hand,
subjects of neutral States and their property may
bear, enemy character. And it is even possible that a
subject of a belligerent may for some parts bear enemy
character as between himself and his home State.</p>

<p>The matter of enemy character is, however, to a
great extent in an unsettled condition, since on many
points connected with it there are no universally recognised
rules of International Law in existence.
British and American Courts have worked out a body
of precise and clear rules on the subject, but the practice
of other countries, and especially of France, follows
different lines. The Second Peace Conference of 1907
produced three articles on the matter&mdash;16, 17, and 18&mdash;in
Convention V., accepted by all the signatory Powers,
except Great Britain which, upon signing the Convention,
entered a reservation against these three
articles, and although these articles are only of minor
importance, they have to be taken into consideration.
On the other hand, the as yet unratified Declaration
of London comprises a number of rules which, apart
from two points, offer a common basis for the practice
of all maritime States. At the first glance it would
seem that only the four articles&mdash;57 to 60&mdash;of Chapter
VI. headed "Enemy Character," treat of the subject
under survey, but a closer examination shows that
article 46, dealing with a certain kind of unneutral
service, articles 55 and 56, dealing with transfer to
a neutral flag, and, lastly, article 63, dealing with
forcible resistance to the right of visitation, are also
concerned with enemy character. In spite of these
stipulations, which are accepted by all the Powers
concerned, there remain two important points unsettled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
since neither the Second Hague Peace Conference of
1907 nor the Naval Conference of London of 1908-9
succeeded in agreeing upon a compromise concerning
the old controversy as to whether nationality exclusively,
or domicile also, should determine the neutral
or enemy character of individuals and their goods, and
further, whether or not neutral vessels acquire enemy
character by embarking in time of war, with permission
of the enemy, upon such trade with the latter as was
closed to them in time of peace (Rule of 1756). According
to article 7 of Convention XII. of the Second Hague
Peace Conference, concerning the establishment of an
International Prize Court, likewise not yet ratified,
this Court would in time have to evolve a uniform
practice of all the maritime States on these two points.</p>

<p>For the consideration of enemy character in detail,
it is convenient to distinguish between individuals,

Character
of Individuals.</p></div>

<p>§ 88. <a name="The_general_rule88" id="The_general_rule88"></a>The general rule with regard to individuals is
that subjects of the belligerents bear enemy character,
whereas subjects of neutral States do not. In this
sense article 16 of Convention V. stipulates: "The
nationals of a State which is not taking part in the
war are considered to be neutral." These neutral
individuals can, however, lose their neutral and acquire
enemy character in several cases, just as subjects of
the belligerents can in other cases lose their enemy
character:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Since relations of peace obtain between either of
the belligerents and neutral States, the subjects of the
latter can, by way of trade and otherwise, render many
kinds of service to either belligerent without thereby
losing their neutral character. On the other hand, if
they enter the armed forces of a belligerent, or if they
commit other acts in his favour, or commit hostile acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
against a belligerent, they acquire enemy character
(article 17 of Convention V.). All measures that are
allowed during war against enemy subjects are likewise
allowed against such subjects of neutral Powers as
have thus acquired enemy character. For instance,
during the late South African War hundreds of subjects
of neutral States, who were fighting in the ranks of the
Boers, were captured by Great Britain and retained as
prisoners until the end of the struggle. Such individuals
must not, however, be more severely treated
than enemy subjects, and, in especial, no punitive
measures are allowed against them (article 17 of
Convention V.). And article 18(<i>a</i>) of Convention V.
stipulates expressly that subjects of neutral States not
inhabiting the territory of the enemy or any territory
militarily occupied by him do not acquire enemy
character by furnishing supplies or making loans to
the enemy, provided the supplies do not come from
the enemy territory or any territory occupied by
him.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_143_143" id="Footnote_143_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_143_143"><span class="label">[143]</span></a> Since Great Britain has entered a reservation against
articles 16, 17, and 18 of Convention V. she is not bound by them. It
is, however, of importance to state that articles 16, 17, and
18(<i>a</i>)&mdash;not 18(<i>b</i>)!&mdash;enact only such rules as were always customarily
recognised, <i>unless such an interpretation is to be put upon article 16
as prevents a belligerent from considering subjects of neutral States
inhabiting the enemy country as bearing enemy character</i>. The matter is
different with regard to article 18(<i>b</i>), which creates an entirely new
rule, for nobody has hitherto doubted that the members of the police
force and the administrative officials of the enemy bear enemy character
whether or no they are subjects of the enemy State.</p></div>

<p>Article 18(<i>b</i>) of Convention V. stipulates that such
subjects of neutral States as render services to the
enemy in matters of police and administration, likewise
do not acquire enemy character. This stipulation
must, however, be read with caution. It can only
mean that such individuals do not lose their neutral
character to a greater degree than other subjects of
neutral States resident on enemy territory; it cannot
mean that they are in every way to be considered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
treated like subjects of neutral States not residing on
enemy territory.</p>

<p>However that may be, it must be specially observed,
that the acts by which subjects of neutral States lose
their neutral and acquire enemy character need not
necessarily be committed after the outbreak of war.
Such individuals can, even before the outbreak of war,
identify themselves to such a degree with a foreign
State that, with the outbreak of war against that
State, enemy character devolves upon them <i>ipso facto</i>
unless they at once sever their connection with such
State. This, for instance, is the case when a foreign
subject in time of peace enlists in the armed forces of a
State and continues to serve after the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>(2) From the time when International Law made its
appearance down to our own no difference has been
made by a belligerent in the treatment accorded to
subjects of the enemy and subjects of neutral States
inhabiting the enemy country. Thus Grotius (III.
c. 4, §§ 6 and 7) teaches that foreigners must share the
fate of the population living on enemy territory, and
Bynkershoek<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> distinctly teaches that foreigners residing
in enemy country bear enemy character. English<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
and American practice assert, therefore, that foreigners,
whether subjects of the belligerents or of neutral
States, acquire enemy character by being domiciled
(<i>i.e.</i> resident) in enemy country, because they have
thereby identified themselves with the enemy population
and contribute, by paying taxes and the like,
to the support of the enemy Government. For this
reason, all measures which may legitimately be taken
against the civil population of the enemy territory, may
likewise be taken against them, unless they withdraw
from the country or are expelled therefrom. It must,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
however, be remembered that they acquire enemy
character <i>in a sense</i> and <i>to a certain degree</i> only, for their
enemy character is not as intensive as that of enemy
subjects resident on enemy territory. Such of them
as are subjects of neutral States do not, therefore, lose
the protection of their home State against arbitrary
treatment inconsistent with the laws of war; and such
of them as are subjects of the other belligerent are
handed over to the protection of the Embassy of a
neutral Power. However that may be, they are not
exempt from requisitions and contributions; from the
restrictions which an occupant imposes upon the
population in the interest of the safety of his troops
and his military operations; from punishments for
hostile acts committed against the occupant; or from
being taken into captivity, if exceptionally necessary.</p>

Emilie</i>, otherwise <i>Emilia</i> (1854), Spinks, 12; the <i>Baltica</i> (1857), 11
Moore, P.C. 141.</p></div>

<p>This treatment of foreigners resident on occupied
enemy territory is generally recognised as legitimate
by theory<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and practice. The proposal of Germany,
made at the Second Peace Conference, to agree upon
rules which would have stipulated a more favourable
treatment of subjects of neutral States resident on
occupied enemy territory was, therefore, rejected. Not
even France supported the German proposals, although
according to the French conception foreigners residing
in enemy country do not acquire enemy character, and
therefore the German proposals were only a logical consequence
of the French conception. This French conception
of enemy character dates from the judgment of
the <i>Conseil des Prises</i> in the case of <i>Le Hardy contre La
Voltigeante</i><a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> (1802), which laid down the rule that
neutral subjects residing in enemy country do not lose
their neutral character, and enemy subjects residing in
neutral countries do not lose their enemy character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
But it must be emphasised that this French conception
of enemy character has been developed, not with
regard to the treatment of foreigners whom an occupant
finds resident on occupied enemy territory, but with
regard to the exercise of the right of capture of enemy
vessels and goods in warfare at sea. France did not
make an attempt to draw the logical consequences
from this conception and, therefore, to mete out to
foreigners resident on occupied enemy territory a
treatment different from that of enemy subjects resident
there.</p>

<p>(3) Since enemy subjects who reside in neutral
countries, or are allowed to remain resident on the
territory of the other belligerent, have to a great extent
identified themselves with the local population and are
not under the territorial supremacy of the enemy, they
lose their enemy character according to English and
American practice,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> but according to French practice
they do not, a difference of practice which bears
upon many points, especially upon the character of
goods.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Enemy
Character
of Vessels.</p></div>

<p>§ 89. <a name="The_general_rule89" id="The_general_rule89"></a>The general rule with regard to vessels is that
their character is determined by their flag. Whatever
may be the nationality of the owner of a vessel&mdash;whether
he be a subject of a neutral State, or of
either belligerent&mdash;she bears enemy character, if she
be sailing under the enemy flag. For this reason, the
vessel of an enemy owner which sails under a neutral
flag does as little bear enemy character as the vessel
of the subject of a neutral State sailing under the flag
of another neutral State. But the flag is the deciding
factor only when the vessel is legitimately sailing under
it. Should it be found that a vessel sailing under the
flag of a certain neutral State has, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Municipal Law of such State, no right to fly the flag
she shows, the real character of the vessel must be determined
in order to decide whether or no she bears enemy
character. On the other hand, it makes no difference
that the owner be the subject of a neutral non-littoral
State without a maritime flag and that the vessel is,
therefore, compelled to fly the flag of a maritime State:
if the flag the vessel flies be the enemy flag, she bears
enemy character.</p>

<p>The general rule that the flag is the deciding factor
has exceptions, and it is convenient to expound the
matter according to the rules of the Declaration of
London, although it is not yet ratified. The general
rule is laid down by article 57 of the Declaration which
enacts that, subject to the provisions respecting transfer
to another flag, the character of a vessel is determined
by the flag she is entitled to fly. Nevertheless, there are
two exceptions to this rule:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) According to article 46 of the Declaration<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> a
neutral merchantman acquires enemy character by
taking a direct part in the hostilities, by being in the
exclusive employment of the enemy government, and
by being at the time exclusively intended either for the
transport of troops or for the transmission of intelligence
for the enemy. And it must be emphasised that
the act by which a neutral merchantman acquires
enemy character need not necessarily be committed
<i>after</i> the outbreak of war, for she can, even <i>before</i> the
outbreak of war, to such a degree identify herself with
a foreign State that, with the outbreak of war against
such State, enemy character devolves upon her <i>ipso
facto</i>, unless she severs her connexion with the State
concerned. This is, for instance, the case of a foreign
merchantman which in time of peace has been hired
by a State for the transport of troops or of war material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and is carrying out her contract in spite of the outbreak
of war.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>(2) According to article 63 of the Declaration a
neutral merchantman acquires enemy character <i>ipso
facto</i> by forcibly resisting the legitimate exercise of the
right of visitation and capture on the part of a belligerent
cruiser (see details below, § <a href="#If_a_neutral422">422</a>).</p>

<p>(3) According to British practice&mdash;adopted by
America and Japan<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>&mdash;neutral merchantmen likewise
acquire enemy character by violating the so-called
rule of 1756,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> in case they engage in time of war in a
trade which the enemy prior to the war reserved exclusively
for merchantmen sailing under his own flag.
The Declaration of London has neither rejected nor
accepted this rule of 1756, for article 57 stipulates expressly
that the case where a neutral vessel is engaged
in a trade which is closed in time of peace, remains
unsettled. It would, therefore, according to article 7
of Convention XII. of the Second Peace Conference, be
the task of the proposed International Prize Court to
settle this point.</p>

<p>Of whatever kind may be the case of the acquisition
of enemy character on the part of a neutral vessel, the
following four rules apply to all cases of such neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
vessels as have acquired enemy character:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) all
enemy goods on board may now be confiscated, although
when they were first shipped the vessels concerned were
neutral; (<i>b</i>) all goods on board will now be presumed to
be enemy goods, and the owners of neutral goods will
have to prove the neutral character of the latter; (<i>c</i>)
the stipulations of articles 48 and 49 of the Declaration
of London concerning the sinking of neutral prizes do
not apply, because these vessels are now enemy vessels;
(<i>d</i>) no appeal may be brought from the national prize
courts to the International Prize Court, except with
regard to the one question only, whether the vessel
concerned has been justly considered to have acquired
enemy character (see article 4 of Convention XII. of
the Second Hague Peace Conference, concerning the
establishment of an International Prize Court).</p>

although it has now lost its former importance:&mdash;
</p><p>
On July 14, 1894, the <i>Kow-shing</i>, a British ship, was hired at Shanghai
by the Chinese Government to serve as a transport for eleven hundred
Chinese soldiers and also for arms and ammunition from Tien-tsin to
Korea. She was met on July 25 near the island of Phung-do, in Korean
waters, by the Japanese fleet; she was signalled to stop, was visited by
some prize officers, and, as it was apparent that she was a transport
for Chinese soldiers, she was ordered to follow the Japanese cruiser,
<i>Naniwa</i>. But although the British captain of the vessel was ready to
comply with these orders, the Chinese on board would not allow it.
Thereupon the Japanese opened fire and sank the vessel. As formerly
hostilities could be commenced without a previous declaration of war the
action of the Japanese was in accordance with the rules of International
Law existing at the time. But in consequence of Convention III. of the
Second Peace Conference which requires a declaration of war before the
opening of hostilities, such action nowadays would not be justifiable.

<div class="sidenote"><p>Enemy
Character
of Goods.</p></div>

<p>§ 90. <a name="It_is_an_old90" id="It_is_an_old90"></a>It is an old customary rule that all goods
found on board an enemy merchantman are presumed
to be enemy goods unless the contrary is proved by
the neutral owners concerned. It is, further, generally
recognised that the enemy character of goods depends
upon the enemy character of their owners. As, however,
no universally recognised rules exist as to the
enemy character of individuals, there are likewise no
universally recognised rules in existence as to the
enemy character of goods.</p>

<p>(1) Since, according to British and American
practice, domicile in enemy country makes an individual
bear enemy character, all goods belonging to
individuals domiciled in enemy country are enemy
goods, and all goods belonging to individuals not resident
in enemy country are not, as a rule, enemy goods.
For this reason, goods belonging to enemy subjects
residing in neutral countries<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> do not, but goods belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to subjects of neutral States residing in enemy
country<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> do bear enemy character, although they may
be the goods of a foreign consul appointed and residing
in enemy country.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Further, the goods of such subjects
of the belligerents as are domiciled on each other's
territory and are allowed to remain there after the outbreak
of war, acquire enemy character in the eyes of
the belligerent whose subjects they are, but lose their
enemy character in the eyes of the belligerent on whose
territory they are allowed to remain.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Again, the
produce of an estate on enemy territory belonging to a
subject of a neutral State who resides abroad, does
bear enemy character, for "<i>Nothing<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> can be more decided
and fixed than the principle ... that the possession of
the soil does impress upon the owner the character of
the country, as far as the produce of that plantation is
concerned ... whatever the local residence of the owner
may be</i>." Lastly, all such property of a subject of a
neutral State residing abroad but having a house of
trade within the enemy country as is concerned in
the commercial transactions of such house of trade,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
likewise bears enemy character, because the owner
of these goods has a "commercial domicile" in enemy
country.</p>

<p>(2) On the other hand, according to French practice,
the nationality of the owner of the goods is exclusively
the deciding factor, and it does not matter where he
resides. Hence only such goods on enemy merchantmen
bear enemy character as belong to subjects of the
enemy, whether those subjects are residing on enemy
or neutral territory; and all such goods on enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
merchantmen as belong to subjects of neutral States
do not bear enemy character, whether those subjects
reside on neutral or enemy country.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>(3) The Declaration of London does not purport
to decide the controversy, since the Powers represented
at the Naval Conference of London could not agree.
Whereas Holland, Spain, and Japan approved of the
British and American practice, Austria-Hungary, Italy,
Germany, and Russia sided with France. For this
reason, the Declaration, by articles 58 and 59, only
enacts that the enemy character of goods on enemy
vessels is determined by the enemy character of their
owner, and that all goods on enemy vessels are presumed
to be enemy goods unless the contrary is proved.
But the chief question, namely, what is the factor
that decides the enemy character of an owner, is
deliberately left unanswered. It would, therefore,
according to article 7 of Convention XII., be for the
proposed International Prize Court to settle it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Transfer
of Enemy
Vessels.</p></div>

<p>§ 91. The question of the transfer of enemy vessels
to subjects of neutral States, either shortly before or
during the war, must be regarded as forming part of
the larger question of enemy character, for the point
to be decided is whether such transfer<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> divests these
vessels of their enemy character. It is obvious that,
if this point is answered in the affirmative, the owners
of enemy vessels can evade the danger of having their
property seized and confiscated by selling their vessels
to subjects of neutral States. Before the Declaration
of London, which is, however, not yet ratified, the
maritime Powers had not agreed upon common rules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
concerning this subject. According to French<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
practice no transfer of enemy vessels to neutrals could
be recognised, and a vessel thus transferred retained
enemy character; but this concerned only transfer after
the outbreak of war, any legitimate transfer anterior
to the outbreak of war did give neutral character to
a vessel. According to British and American practice,
on the other hand, neutral vessels could well be transferred
to a neutral flag before or after the outbreak of
war and lose thereby their enemy character, provided
that the transfer took place <i>bona fide</i>,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> was not effected
either in a blockaded port<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> or while the vessel was <i>in
transitu</i>,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> the vendor did not retain an interest in the
vessel or did not stipulate a right to recover or repurchase
the vessel after the conclusion of the war,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
and the transfer was not made <i>in transitu</i> in contemplation
of war.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>The Declaration of London offers clear and decisive
rules concerning the transfer of enemy vessels, making
a distinction between the transfer to a neutral flag
<i>before</i> and <i>after</i> the outbreak of hostilities:</p>

<p>(1) According to article 55 of the Declaration, the
transfer of an enemy vessel to a neutral flag, if effected
<i>before</i> the outbreak of hostilities, is <i>valid</i>, unless the
captor is able to prove that the transfer was made in
order to avoid capture. However, if the bill of sale is
not on board the transferred vessel, and if the transfer
was effected less than sixty days before the outbreak
of hostilities, the transfer is presumed to be void, unless
the vessel can prove that such transfer was not effected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
in order to avoid capture. To provide commerce with
a guarantee that a transfer should not easily be treated
as void on the ground that it was effected for the purpose
of evading capture, it is stipulated that, in case
the transfer was effected more than thirty days before
the outbreak of hostilities, there is an absolute presumption
of its validity, provided the transfer was
unconditional, complete, and in conformity with the
laws of the countries concerned, and further, provided
that neither the control of, nor the profits arising
from, the employment of the vessels remain in the
same hands as before the transfer. But even in this
case a vessel is suspect if the transfer took place less
than sixty days before the outbreak of hostilities, and
if her bill of sale is not on board. Hence she may be
seized and brought into a port of a prize court for
investigation, and she cannot claim damages for the
capture, even if the Court releases her.</p>

<p>(2) According to article 56 of the Declaration, the
transfer of an enemy vessel to a neutral flag, if effected
<i>after</i> the outbreak of hostilities, is <i>void</i> unless the vessel
can prove that the transfer was not made in order to
avoid capture. And such proof is excluded, and an
absolute presumption is established that the transfer
is void, if the transfer has been made in a blockaded
port or while the vessel was <i>in transitu</i>, further, if
a right to repurchase or recover the vessel is reserved
to the vendor, and lastly, if the requirements of the
Municipal Law governing the right to fly the flag
under which the vessel is sailing have not been
fulfilled.</p>

of Goods

<p>§ 92. The subject of the transfer of enemy goods on
enemy vessels must likewise be considered as forming
part of the larger subject of enemy character, for the
question is here also whether such a transfer divests
these goods of their enemy character. And concerning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
this question<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> there was likewise no unanimous practice
in existence among the maritime States before
the agreement on the Declaration of London. British
and American practice refused to recognise a sale <i>in
transitu</i> under any circumstances or conditions, if
the vessel concerned was captured before the neutral
buyer had actually taken possession of the transferred
goods.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> On the other hand, French practice recognised
such a sale <i>in transitu</i>, provided it could be proved that
the transaction was made <i>bona fide</i>.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The Declaration of London now stipulates, by
article 60, that enemy goods on board an enemy vessel
retain their enemy character until they reach their
destination, notwithstanding any transfer effected after
the outbreak of hostilities while the goods are <i>in
transitu</i>. Hence if such enemy vessel is captured before
having reached her destination, goods consigned to
enemy subjects may be confiscated, although they have
been sold <i>in transitu</i> to subjects of neutral States.
A special rule is provided for the case of the enemy
consignee of goods on board an enemy vessel becoming
bankrupt while the goods are <i>in transitu</i>. In a number
of countries<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> an unpaid vendor has, in the event of the
bankruptcy of the buyer, a recognised legal right to
recover such goods as have already become the property
of the buyer, but have not yet reached him (right of
stoppage <i>in transitu</i>). For this reason, article 60 of
the Declaration stipulates in the second paragraph,
that if, prior to the capture, the neutral consignor
exercises, on the bankruptcy of the enemy consignee,
his right of stoppage <i>in transitu</i>, the goods regain their
neutral character and may not therefore be confiscated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Commencement
of
War in
General.</p></div>

<p>§ 93. According to the former practice of the States
a condition of war could <i>de facto</i> arise either through
a declaration of war; or through a proclamation and
manifesto of a State that it considered itself at war
with another State; or through the committal by one
State of certain hostile acts of force against another
State. History presents many instances of wars commenced
in one of these three ways. Although Grotius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
(III. c. 3, § 5) laid down the rule that a declaration of
war is necessary for its commencement, the practice of
the States shows that this rule was not accepted, and
many wars have taken place between the time of
Grotius and our own without a previous<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> declaration
of war. Indeed many writers,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> following the example
of Grotius, have always asserted the existence of a
rule that a declaration is necessary for the commencement
of war, but it cannot be denied that until the
Second Peace Conference of 1907 such a rule was neither
sanctioned by custom nor by a general treaty of the
Powers. Moreover many writers<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> distinctly approved
of the practice of the Powers. This does not mean
that in former times a State would have been justified
in opening hostilities without any preceding conflict.
There was, and can be, no greater violation of the Law of
Nations than for a State to begin hostilities in time of
peace without previous controversy and without having
endeavoured to settle the conflict by negotiation.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
But if negotiation had been tried without success, a
State did not act treacherously in case it resorted to
hostilities without a declaration of war, especially after
diplomatic intercourse had been broken off. The rule,
adopted by the First Peace Conference of 1899&mdash;see
article 2 of the Conventions for the peaceful settlement
of international differences of 1899 and 1907&mdash;which
stipulates that, <i>as far as circumstances allow</i>, before the
appeal to arms recourse must be had to the good offices
or mediation of friendly Powers, did not essentially
alter matters, for the formula <i>as far as circumstances</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
<i>allow</i> leaves practically everything to the discretion of
the Power bent on making war.</p>

<p>The outbreak of war between Russia and Japan in
1904 through Japanese torpedo boats attacking Russian
men-of-war at Port Arthur before a formal declaration
of war, caused a movement for the establishment of
some written rules concerning the commencement of
war. The Institute of International Law, at its
meeting at Ghent in 1906, adopted three principles<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
according to which war should not be commenced
without either a declaration of war or an ultimatum,
and in either case a certain delay sufficient to ensure
against treacherous surprise must be allowed before the
belligerent can have recourse to actual hostilities. The
Second Peace Conference at the Hague in 1907 took
the matter up and produced the Convention (III.)
relative to the commencement of hostilities which
comprises four articles and has been signed by all the
Powers represented at the Conference, except China
and Nicaragua, both of which, however, acceded later.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Declaration
of
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 94. <a name="According_to94" id="According_to94"></a>According to article 1 of Convention III.
hostilities must not commence without a previous and
unequivocal warning, and one of the forms which this
warning may take is a declaration of war stating the
reasons why the Power concerned has recourse to arms.</p>

<p>A declaration of war is a communication of one State
to another that the condition of peace between them has
come to an end and a condition of war has taken its
place. In former times declarations of war used to
take place under greater or lesser solemnities, but during
the last few centuries all these formalities have vanished,
and a declaration of war nowadays may take place
through a simple communication. The only two conditions
with which, according to article 1, declarations
of war must comply are, that they must be unmistakable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and that they must state the reason for the resort
to arms. No delay between the declaration and the
actual commencement of hostilities is stipulated, and
it is, therefore, possible for a Power to open hostilities
immediately after the communication of the declaration
of war to the enemy. All the more is it necessary
to emphasise that there could be no greater violation
of the Law of Nations than that which would be committed
by a State which sent a declaration to another
without previously having tried to settle the difference
concerned by negotiation.</p>

<p>However this may be, the question as to the way in
which the communication of the declaration of war is
to be made requires attention. Since there is nowhere
a rule expressly formulated according to which the
declaration must be communicated in writing, it might
be asserted that communication by any means, be it
by a written document, by telegraph or by telephone
message, or by direct word of mouth, is admissible.
I believe that such an assertion cannot be supported.
The essential importance of the declaration of war and
the fact that according to article 1 of Convention III.
it must be unmistakable and must state the reason for
the resort to arms, would seem to require a written
document which is to be handed over to the other
party by an envoy. Further, the fact that article 2 of
Convention III. expressly enacts that the notification
of the outbreak of war to neutrals <i>may even be made
by telegraph</i>, points the same way, for the conclusion
is justified that the declaration of war stipulated as
necessary by article I may <i>not</i> be made by telegraph.
And if a telegraph message is inadmissible, much more
are telephone messages and communications by word of
mouth. Moreover, the practice of the States throughout
the last centuries has been to hand in a written declaration
of war, when any declaration has been made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Particular attention must be paid to the fact that,
in case of a declaration of war, the war, as between the
belligerents, is considered to have commenced with the
date of its declaration, although actual hostilities may
not have been commenced until a much later date. On
the other hand, as regards relations between the belligerents
and neutrals, a war is not considered to have
commenced until its outbreak has either been notified
to the neutrals or has otherwise become unmistakably
known to them. For this reason, article 2 of Convention
III. enacts that the belligerents must at once
after the outbreak of war notify<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> the neutrals, even if
only by telegraph, and that the state of war shall not
take effect with regard to neutrals until after they have
received notification, unless it be established beyond
doubt that they were in fact aware of the condition
of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Ultimatum.</p></div>

<p>§ 95. <a name="The_second_form95" id="The_second_form95"></a>The second form which the unequivocal
warning, stipulated by article 1 of Convention III. as
necessary before the commencement of hostilities, may
take is an ultimatum with a conditional declaration
of war.</p>

<p>Ultimatum<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> is the technical term for a written
communication of one State to another which ends
amicable negotiations respecting a difference, and
formulates, for the last time and categorically, the
demands to be fulfilled if other measures are to be
averted. An ultimatum may be simple or qualified.
It is <i>simple</i> in case it does not include an indication
of the measures contemplated by the Power sending
it; such measures may be acts of retorsion or reprisals,
or hostilities. It is <i>qualified</i> if it includes an indication
of the measures contemplated by the Power sending it,
for instance a pacific blockade, occupation of a certain
territory, or war. Now the ultimatum stipulated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
article 1 of Convention III. must be a qualified one, for
it must be so worded that the recipient can have no
doubt about the commencement of war in case he does
not comply with the demands of the ultimatum. For
this reason, if a State has sent a simple ultimatum to
another, or a qualified ultimatum threatening a measure
other than war, it is not, in case of non-compliance,
justified in at once commencing hostilities without a
previous declaration of war. For this reason, Italy
sent a declaration of war to Turkey in 1911, although
an ultimatum threatening the occupation of Tripoli
had preceded it.</p>

<p>Nothing is enacted by article 1 of Convention III.
concerning the minimum length of time which an ultimatum
must grant before the commencement of
hostilities; this period may, therefore, be only very
short, as, for instance, a number of hours. All the
more is it necessary here likewise to emphasise that
there could be no greater violation of the Law of Nations
than that which would be committed by a State which
sent an ultimatum without previously having tried to
settle the difference concerned by negotiation.</p>

<p>It must be specially observed that the state of war
following an ultimatum must likewise be notified to
neutrals, for article 2 of Convention III. applies to this
case also. And it must further be observed that, for
the same reason as in the case of a declaration of war,
an ultimatum containing a conditional declaration of
war must be communicated to the other party by a
written document.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_178_178" id="Footnote_178_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_178_178"><span class="label">[178]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Initiative
hostile
Acts of
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 96. There is no doubt that, in consequence of
Convention III. of the Second Peace Conference, the
recourse to hostilities without a previous declaration of
war or qualified ultimatum is forbidden. But the fact
must not be overlooked that a war can nevertheless
break out without these preliminaries. Thus a State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
might deliberately order hostilities to be commenced
without a previous declaration of war or qualified
ultimatum. Further, the armed forces of two States
having a grievance against one another might engage
in hostilities without having been authorised thereto
and without the respective Governments ordering them
to desist from further hostilities. Again, acts of force
by way of reprisals or during a pacific blockade or an
intervention might be forcibly resisted by the other
party, hostilities breaking out in this way.</p>

<p>It is certain that States which deliberately order
the commencement of hostilities without a previous
declaration of war or qualified ultimatum, commit an
international delinquency, but they are nevertheless
engaged in war. Further, it is certain that States
which allow themselves to be dragged into a condition
of war through unauthorised hostile acts of their armed
forces, commit an international delinquency, but they
are nevertheless engaged in war. Again, war is actually
in existence if the other party forcibly resists acts of
force undertaken by a State by way of reprisals, or
during a pacific blockade or an intervention. Now in
all these and similar cases, although war has broken
out without a previous declaration or qualified ultimatum,
all the laws of warfare must find application,
for a war is still war in the eyes of International Law
even though it has been illegally commenced, or has
automatically arisen from acts of force which were not
intended to be acts of war.</p>

<p>However that may be, article 2 of Convention III.
also applies to wars which have broken out without a
previous declaration or qualified ultimatum, and the
belligerents must without delay send a notification to
neutral Powers so that these may be compelled to
fulfil the duties of neutrality. But, of course, neutral
Powers must in this case likewise, even without notification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
fulfil the duties of neutrality if they are unmistakably
aware of the outbreak of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>General
Effects of
the Outbreak
of
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 97. <a name="When_war97" id="When_war97"></a>When war breaks out, even if it be limited
to only two members of the Family of Nations, nevertheless
the whole Family of Nations is thereby affected,
since the rights and duties of neutrality devolve upon
such States as are not parties to the war. And the
subjects of neutral States may feel the consequences of
the outbreak of war in many ways. War is not only a
calamity to the commerce and industry of the whole
world, but also involves the alteration of the legal
position of neutral merchantmen on the Open Sea, and
of the subjects of neutral States within the boundaries of
the belligerents. For the belligerents have the right
of visit, search, and eventually capture of neutral
merchantmen on the Open Sea, and foreigners who
remain within the boundaries of the belligerents,
although subjects of neutral Powers, acquire in a degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and to a certain extent enemy character.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> However,
the outbreak of war tells chiefly and directly upon the
relations between the belligerents and their subjects.
Yet it would not be correct to maintain that all legal
relations between the parties thereto and between their
subjects disappear with the outbreak of war. War is
not a condition of anarchy, indifferent or hostile to
law, but a condition recognised and ruled by International
Law, although it involves a rupture of peaceful
relations between the belligerents.</p>

<p>§ 98. <a name="Th98" id="Th98"></a>The outbreak of war causes at once the rupture
of diplomatic intercourse between the belligerents, if
such rupture has not already taken place. The respective
diplomatic envoys are recalled and ask for
their passports, or receive them without any previous
request, but they enjoy their privileges of inviolability
and exterritoriality for the period of time
requisite for leaving the country. Consular activity
likewise comes to an end through the outbreak of
war.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Cancellation
of
Treaties.</p></div>

<p>§ 99. <a name="The_doctrine_was99" id="The_doctrine_was99"></a>The doctrine was formerly held, and a few
writers<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> maintain it even now, that the outbreak of
war <i>ipso facto</i> cancels all treaties previously concluded
between the belligerents, such treaties only excepted
as have been concluded especially for the case of war.
The vast majority of modern writers on International
Law have abandoned this standpoint,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and the opinion
is pretty general that war by no means annuls every
treaty. But unanimity as to what treaties are or are
not cancelled by war does not exist. Neither does a
uniform practice of the States exist, cases having occurred
in which States have expressly declared<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
they considered all treaties annulled through war.
Thus the whole question remains as yet unsettled.
Nevertheless a majority of writers agree on the
following points:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The outbreak of war cancels all political treaties
between the belligerents which have not been concluded
for the purpose of setting up a permanent condition of
things, for instance, treaties of alliance.</p>

<p>(2) On the other hand, it is obvious that such
treaties as have been especially concluded for the case
of war are not annulled, such as treaties in regard to
the neutralisation of certain parts of the territories of
the belligerents.</p>

<p>(3) Such political and other treaties as have been
concluded for the purpose of setting up a permanent<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
condition of things are not <i>ipso facto</i> annulled by the
outbreak of war, but nothing prevents the victorious
party from imposing upon the other party in the treaty
of peace any alterations in, or even the dissolution of,
such treaties.</p>

<p>(4) Such non-political treaties as do not intend to
set up a permanent condition of things, as treaties of
commerce for example, are not <i>ipso facto</i> annulled,
but the parties may annul them or suspend them
according to discretion.</p>

<p>(5) So-called law-making<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> treaties, as the Declaration
of Paris for example, are not cancelled by the
outbreak of war. The same is valid in regard to all
treaties to which a multitude of States are parties, as
the International Postal Union for example, but the
belligerents may suspend them, as far as they themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
are concerned, in case the necessities of war

<div class="sidenote"><p>Precarious
position
of Belligerents'
subjects
on Enemy
Territory.</p></div>

<p>§ 100. <a name="The_outbreak_of_war100" id="The_outbreak_of_war100"></a>The outbreak of war affects likewise such
subjects of the belligerents as are at the time within
the enemy's territory. In former times they could
at once be detained as prisoners of war, and many
States, therefore, concluded in time of peace special
treaties for the time of war expressly stipulating a
specified period during which their subjects should be
allowed to leave each other's territory unmolested.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
Through the influence of such treaties, which became
pretty general during the eighteenth century, it
became an international practice that, as a rule,
enemy subjects must be allowed to withdraw within
a reasonable period, and no instance of the former
rule has occurred during the nineteenth<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> century.
Although some<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> writers even nowadays maintain that
according to strict law the old rule is still in force, it
may safely<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> be maintained that there is now a customary
rule of International Law, according to which
all such subjects of the enemy as have not according to
the Municipal Law of their country to join the armed
forces of the enemy must be allowed a reasonable
period for withdrawal. On the other hand, such enemy
subjects as are active or reserve officers, or reservists,
and the like, may be prevented from leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
country and detained as prisoners of war, for the
principle of self-preservation must justify belligerents
in refusing to furnish each other with resources which
increase their means of offence and defence.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> However
that may be, a belligerent need not allow<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> enemy subjects
to remain on his territory, although this is frequently
done. Thus, during the Crimean War Russian
subjects in Great Britain and France were allowed to
remain there, as were likewise Russians in Japan and
Japanese in Russia during the Russo-Japanese War,
and Turks in Italy during the Turco-Italian War.
On the other hand, France expelled all Germans during
the Franco-German war in 1870; the former South
African Republics expelled most British subjects when
war broke out in 1899; Russia, although during the
Russo-Japanese War she allowed Japanese subjects
to remain in other parts of her territory, expelled
them from her provinces in the Far East; and in
May 1912, eight months after the outbreak of the
Turko-Italian War, Turkey decreed the expulsion of
all Italians, certain classes excepted. In case a belligerent
allows the residence of enemy subjects on his
territory, he can, of course, give the permission
under certain conditions only, such as an oath to
abstain from all hostile acts or a promise not to leave a
certain region, and the like. And it must be especially
observed that an enemy subject who is allowed to stay
in the country after the outbreak of war must not, in
case the forces of his home State militarily occupy the
part of the country inhabited by him, join these forces
or assist them in any way. If, nevertheless, he does
so, he is liable to be punished for treason<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> by the local
Sovereign after the withdrawal of the enemy forces.</p>

France by Napoleon at the outbreak of war with England in 1803 and kept
as prisoners of war for many years, it must be borne in mind that
Napoleon did not claim a right to make such civilians prisoners of war
as were at the outbreak of war on French soil. He justified his act as
one of reprisals, considering it a violation of the Law of Nations on
the part of England to begin hostilities by capturing two French
merchantmen in the Bay of Audierne without a formal declaration of war.

Enemy
Territory.</p></div>

<p>§ 100<i>a</i>. <a name="Formerly_the_rule100a" id="Formerly_the_rule100a"></a>Formerly the rule prevailed everywhere
that an enemy subject has no <i>persona standi in judicio</i>
and is, therefore, <i>ipso facto</i> by the outbreak of war,
prevented from either taking or defending proceedings
in the Courts. This rule dates from the time when war
was considered such a condition between belligerents as
justified the committing of hostilities on the part of all
subjects of the one belligerent against all subjects of
the other, and, further, the killing of all enemy subjects
irrespective of sex and age, and, at any rate, the confiscation
of all private enemy property. War in those
times used to put enemy subjects entirely <i>ex lege</i>, and
it was only a logical consequence from this principle
that enemy subjects could not sustain <i>persona standi
in judicio</i>. Since the rule that enemy subjects are
entirely <i>ex lege</i> has everywhere vanished, the rule that
they may not take or defend proceedings in the Courts
has in many countries, such as Austria-Hungary,
Germany, Holland, and Italy, likewise vanished. But
in Great Britain and the United States of America<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
enemy subjects are still prevented from taking and
defending legal proceedings,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> although there are six
exceptions to the general rule. Firstly, enemy subjects
who do not bear enemy character because they are
resident in neutral country or have a licence to trade or
are allowed<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> to remain in the country of a belligerent,
are therefore permitted to sue and be sued in British
and American Courts. Secondly, if during time of
peace a defendant obtains an opportunity to plead,
and if subsequently war breaks out with the country
of the plaintiff, the defendant may not plead that the
plaintiff is prevented from suing.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Thirdly, if a contract
was entered into and executed before the war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>

<p>It is asserted that, in consequence of article 23 (<i>h</i>)
of the Hague Regulations concerning land warfare
enacting the injunction "to declare extinguished, suspended,
or unenforceable in a Court of Law the rights
and rights of action of the nationals of the adverse
party," Great Britain and the United States are compelled
to abolish their rule that enemy subjects may not
sue. But the interpretation of article 23 (<i>h</i>) is controversial,
Great Britain and the United States of America&mdash;in
contradistinction to Germany and France&mdash;maintaining
that the article has nothing to do with their
Municipal Law but concerns the conduct of armies in
occupied enemy territory.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

controversy which the third Peace Conference must settle. See above,

<p>However this may be, it must be especially observed
that, according to British and American law, claims
arising out of contracts concluded before the war do not
become extinguished through the outbreak of war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
but are only suspended during war, and the Statute of
Limitations does not, according to American<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> practice

and German<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> writers assert the existence of a rule of
International Law that all intercourse, and especially
trading, is <i>ipso facto</i> by the outbreak of war prohibited
between the subjects of the belligerents, unless it is
permitted under the customs of war, as, for instance,
ransom bills, or is allowed under special licences, and
that all contracts concluded between the subjects of
the belligerents before the outbreak of war become
extinct or suspended. On the other hand, most German,
French, and Italian writers deny the existence of such
a rule, but assert the existence of another according
to which belligerents are empowered to prohibit by
special orders all trade between their own and enemy
subjects.</p>

<p>These assertions are remnants of the time when
the distinction<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> between International and Municipal
Law was not, or not clearly, drawn. International
Law, being a law for the conduct of States only and
exclusively, has nothing to do directly with the conduct
of private individuals, and both assertions are, therefore,
nowadays untenable. Their place must be taken
by the statement that, States being sovereign and the
outbreak of war bringing the peaceful relations between
belligerents to an end, it is within the competence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of every State to enact by its Municipal Law
such rules as it pleases concerning intercourse, and
especially trading, between its own and enemy subjects.
And if we look at the Municipal Laws of the several
countries, we find that they have to be divided into two
groups. To the one group belong those States&mdash;such
as Austria-Hungary, Germany, Holland, and Italy&mdash;whose
Governments are empowered by their Municipal
Laws to prohibit by special order all trading with
enemy subjects at the outbreak of war. In these
countries trade with enemy subjects is permitted to
continue after the outbreak of war unless special
prohibitive orders are issued. To the other group
belong those States&mdash;such as Great Britain, the United
States of America, and, unless <i>desuetudo</i><a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> has made an
alteration, France&mdash;whose Municipal Laws declare
trade and intercourse with enemy subjects <i>ipso facto</i>
by the outbreak of war prohibited, but empowers the
Governments to allow by special licences all or certain
kinds of such trade.</p>

<p>As regards the law of Great Britain<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and the
United States of America, it has been, since the end
of the eighteenth century, an absolutely settled<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> rule
of the Common Law that, certain cases excepted, all
trading with alien enemies is <i>ipso facto</i> by the outbreak
of war illegal unless it is allowed by special licences of
the Crown. From the general principle asserted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
leading cases,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> the Courts have drawn the following
more important consequences:&mdash;</p>

(1) All contracts, entered into <i>during</i> a war,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> with alien
enemies without a special licence are illegal, invalid, and can
never be enforced, unless the contract was one entered into in
case of necessity,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> or in order to supply<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> an invading
English army or the English fleet, or by prisoners<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> of war
concerning personal services and requirements.

(2) Trading with the enemy does not become legal by the fact that
goods coming from the enemy country to Great Britain, or going
from Great Britain to the enemy country, are sent to their
destination through a neutral country.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>

(3) As regards contracts entered into <i>before</i><a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> the outbreak of
war, a distinction must be drawn:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Executory contracts are
avoided, both parties being released from performance. (<i>b</i>)
Contracts executed before the outbreak of war and not requiring to
be acted upon during the war are suspended until after the
conclusion of peace. (<i>c</i>) Executed contracts which require acting
upon during the war are dissolved.

(4) Partnerships<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> with alien enemies are dissolved.

(5) No interest runs on debts<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> or mortgages.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

(6) A contract of affreightment<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> must not be fulfilled;
therefore English ships must not load or unload goods in an enemy
port.

(7) Contracts of insurance of enemy vessels and goods are so to be
construed as to contain a proviso that the assurance shall not
cover any loss occurring during a war between the country of the
assurer and the country of the assured.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>

(8) A life insurance policy,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> entered into before the outbreak
of war conditioning the payment of yearly premiums on pain of
forfeiture of the policy, is forfeited <i>ipso facto</i> by the
outbreak of war because the payment of the premium is now
prohibited. After the conclusion of peace, however, the insured
may claim the equitable value of the policy arising, at the time
of the outbreak of war, from the premiums actually paid.

<p>It must be specially observed that, if the continental
interpretation of article 23 (<i>h</i>) of the Hague Regulations&mdash;see
above, § <a href="#Formerly_the_rule100a">100<i>a</i></a>&mdash;were not contradicted by Great
Britain and the United States of America, both countries
would be compelled to alter their Municipal Laws in so
far as these declare such contracts as have been entered
into with alien enemies before the outbreak of war
dissolved, void, or suspended. Article 23 (<i>h</i>) distinctly
enacts that it is forbidden to declare extinguished or
suspended the rights of the nationals of the adverse

Great Britain and the United States of America uphold

Through the influence of such treaties as well as of
Municipal Laws and Decrees enacting the same, an
international usage and practice grew up that belligerents
should neither confiscate private enemy property
nor annul enemy debts on their territory. The
last case of confiscation of private property is that of
1793 at the outbreak of war between France and
Great Britain. No case of confiscation occurred during
the nineteenth century, and although several writers
maintain that according to strict law the old rule, in
contradistinction to the usage which they do not deny,
is still valid, it may safely be maintained that it is
obsolete, and that there is now a customary rule of
International Law in existence prohibiting the confiscation
of private enemy property and the annulment
of enemy debts on the territory of a belligerent. This
rule, however, does not prevent a belligerent from
seizing public enemy property on his territory, such as
funds, ammunition, provisions, rolling stock of enemy
state-railways, and other valuables; from preventing
the withdrawal of private enemy property which may
be made use of by the enemy<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> for military operations,
such as arms and munitions; from seizing and making
use of rolling stock belonging to private enemy railway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
companies, other means of transport of persons or goods
which are private enemy property, and, further, all
appliances for the transmission of news, although they
are private enemy property, provided all these articles
are restored and indemnities are paid for them after
the conclusion of peace;<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and from suspending, as a
measure of self preservation, the payment of large
enemy debts till after the conclusion of peace in order
to prevent the increase of resources of the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of
the Outbreak
of
War on
Merchantmen.</p></div>

<p>§ 102<i>a</i>. <a name="In_former_times102a" id="In_former_times102a"></a>In former times International Law empowered
States at the outbreak of war to lay an embargo
upon all enemy merchantmen in their harbours in order
to confiscate them. And enemy merchantmen on the
sea could at the outbreak of war be captured and confiscated
although they did not even know of the outbreak
of war. As regards enemy merchantmen in
the harbours of the belligerents, it became, from the
outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, a usage, if not a
custom, that no embargo<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> could be laid on them for
the purpose of confiscating them, and that a reasonable
time must be granted them to depart unmolested; but
no rule was in existence until the Second Peace Conference
of 1907 which prescribed immunity from confiscation
for such enemy merchantmen at sea as did not
know of the outbreak of war. This Conference took
the matter into consideration, and produced a Convention
(VI.) relative to the status of enemy merchantmen
at the outbreak of hostilities<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> which is signed by
all the Powers represented at the Conference, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the United States of America,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> China, and Nicaragua;
but Nicaragua acceded later. In coming to an agreement
on the subject, two facts had to be taken into
consideration. There is, firstly, the fact that in all
maritime countries numerous merchantmen are now
built from special designs in order that they may
quickly, at the outbreak of or during war, be converted
into cruisers; it would therefore be folly on the part
of a belligerent to grant any lenient treatment to such
vessels. There is, secondly, the fact, that a belligerent
fleet cannot nowadays remain effective for long without
being accompanied by a train of colliers, transport
vessels, and repairing vessels; it is, therefore, of the
greatest importance for a belligerent to have as many
merchantmen as possible at his disposal for the purpose
of making use of them for such assistance to the fleet.
For this reason, Convention VI. represents a compromise,
and it distinguishes between vessels in the harbours
of the belligerents and vessels on the sea. Its
provisions are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_227_227" id="Footnote_227_227"></a><a href="#FNanchor_227_227"><span class="label">[227]</span></a> See

Nos. 74-81; Scott in <i>A.J.</i> II. (1908), pp. 260-269.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_229_229" id="Footnote_229_229"></a><a href="#FNanchor_229_229"><span class="label">[229]</span></a> The United States of America refused to sign the Convention
because she considers its stipulations retrogressive as they are less
liberal than the practice which has prevailed since 1854. But
circumstances have changed since that time, and the two facts explained
in the text would seem to have compelled the maritime Powers to adopt
rules somewhat less liberal. This was the more necessary since no
agreement could be arrived at concerning the question of the locality in
which belligerents should be allowed to convert merchantmen into
cruisers.</p></div>

<p>(1) Article 1 of the Convention enacts that, in case
an enemy merchantman is at the beginning of the war
in the port of a belligerent, it is <i>desirable</i> that she should
be allowed freely to depart, either immediately or after
a sufficient term of grace, and, after being furnished
with a passport, to proceed either direct to her port of
destination or to such other port as may be determined.
It is obvious that, since only the desirability of free
departure of such vessels is stipulated, a belligerent is
not compelled to grant free departure; nevertheless
there must be grave reasons for not acting in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
with what is considered desirable by article 1. And
it must be specially observed that a belligerent may
make a distinction in the treatment of several enemy
vessels in his harbours, and may grant free departure to
one or more of them, and refuse it to others, according
to his discretion.</p>

<p>(2) The former usage that enemy merchantmen in
the harbours of the belligerents at the outbreak of war
may not be confiscated, has been made a <i>binding rule</i>
by article 2 which enacts that such vessels as were not
allowed to leave, or were by <i>force majeure</i> prevented
from leaving during the term of grace, may not be confiscated,
but may only be detained under the obligation
that they shall be restored, without indemnity, after the
conclusion of peace, or they may be requisitioned on
condition of indemnities to be paid to the owners.</p>

<p>(3) Enemy merchantmen which have left their last
port of departure before the outbreak of war and which,
while ignorant of the outbreak of war, are met at sea by
cruisers of the belligerents, may, according to article 3,
be captured, but they may not be confiscated, for they
must be restored after the war is ended, although no
indemnities need be paid. Indemnities are only to
be paid in case the vessels have been requisitioned or
destroyed, for a belligerent is empowered to requisition
or destroy such vessels provided he takes care to preserve
the ship papers and makes arrangements for the
safety of the persons on board.</p>

<p>It is obvious that, in case such vessels are not
ignorant of the outbreak of war&mdash;having, for instance,
received the news by wireless telegraphy&mdash;they may not
any longer claim the privileges stipulated by article 3.
And this article stipulates expressly that after having
touched a port of their own or of a neutral country,
such vessels are no longer privileged.</p>

<p>(4) Enemy goods on board such enemy merchantmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
as are in the harbour of a belligerent at the outbreak
of war or at sea and are in ignorance of the outbreak
of war are, according to article 4, privileged to
the same extent as the vessels concerned.</p>

<p>(5) Enemy merchantmen whose construction indicates
that they are intended to be converted into
cruisers may be seized and confiscated in the harbours
of the belligerents, as well as at sea, although ignorant
of the outbreak of war, for article 5 stipulates expressly
that Convention VI. does not affect such vessels.</p>

<p>§ 103. <a name="The_purpose_of_war103" id="The_purpose_of_war103"></a>The purpose of war, namely, the overpowering
of the enemy, is served in land warfare through two
aims<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>&mdash;firstly, defeat of the enemy armed forces on
land, and, secondly, occupation and administration of
the enemy territory. The chief means by which
belligerents try to realise those aims, and which are
always conclusively decisive, are the different sorts of
force applied against enemy persons. But besides
such violence against enemy persons there are other
means which are not at all unimportant, although they
play a secondary part only. Such means are: appropriation,
utilisation, and destruction of enemy property;
siege; bombardment; assault; espionage;
utilisation of treason; ruses. All these means of
warfare on land must be discussed in this chapter,
as must also occupation of enemy territory.</p>

unlimited right as to the means they adopt for injuring
the enemy." For not all possible practices of injuring
the enemy in offence and defence are lawful, certain
practices being prohibited under all circumstances and
conditions, and other practices being allowed only under
certain circumstances and conditions, or only with
certain restrictions. The principles of chivalry and of
humanity have been at work<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> for many hundreds of
years to create these restrictions, and their work is not
yet at an end. However, apart from these restrictions,
all kinds and degrees of force and many other practices
may be made use of in war.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_231_231" id="Footnote_231_231"></a><a href="#FNanchor_231_231"><span class="label">[231]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Objects

<p>§ 105. In a sense all means of warfare are directed
against one object only&mdash;namely, the enemy State,
which is to be overpowered by all legitimate means.
Apart from this, the means of land warfare are directed
against several objects.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Such objects are chiefly the
members of the armed forces of the enemy, but likewise,
although in a lesser degree, other enemy persons;
further, private and public property, fortresses, and
roads. Indeed, apart from certain restrictions, everything
may eventually be the object of a means of warfare, provided
the means are legitimate in themselves and are
capable of fostering the realisation of the purpose of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Land

<p>§ 106. Land warfare must be distinguished from sea
warfare chiefly for two reasons. Firstly, their circumstances
and conditions differ widely from each other,
and, therefore, their means and practices also differ.
Secondly, the law-making Conventions which deal with
warfare rarely deal with land and sea warfare at the
same time, but mostly treat them separately, for whereas
some Conventions deal exclusively with warfare on
sea, the Hague Regulations (Convention IV.) deal
exclusively with warfare on land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 107. <a name="As_war_is_a_contention107" id="As_war_is_a_contention107"></a>As war is a contention between States for
the purpose of overpowering each other, violence
consisting of different sorts of force applied against
enemy persons is the chief and decisive means of
warfare. These different sorts of force are used against
combatants as well as non-combatants, but with discrimination
and differentiation. The purpose of the
application of violence against combatants is their
disablement so that they can no longer take part
in the fighting. And this purpose may be realised
through either killing or wounding them, or making
them prisoners. As regards non-combatant members
of armed forces, private enemy persons showing no
hostile conduct, and officials in important positions,
only minor means of force may as a rule be applied,
since they do not take part in the armed contention
of the belligerents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Killing
and
Wounding
of Combatants.</p></div>

<p>§ 108. Every combatant may be killed or wounded,
whether a private soldier or an officer, or even the
monarch or a member of his family. Some publicists<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
assert that it is a usage of warfare not to aim at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
sovereign or a member of his family. Be that as it
may, there is in strict law<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> no rule preventing the
killing and wounding of such illustrious persons. But
combatants may only be killed or wounded if they are
able and willing to fight or to resist capture. Therefore,
such combatants as are disabled by sickness or
wounds may not be killed. Further, such combatants
as lay down arms and surrender or do not resist being
made prisoners may neither be killed nor wounded, but
must be given quarter. These rules are universally recognised,
and are now expressly enacted by article 23 (<i>c</i>)
of the Hague Regulations, although the fury of battle
frequently makes individual fighters<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> forget and neglect

example of Charles XII. of Sweden (quoted by Vattel), who was

<p>§ 109. However, the rule that quarter must be given
has its exceptions. Although it has of late been a
customary rule of International Law, and although
the Hague Regulations now expressly stipulate by
article 23 (<i>d</i>) that belligerents are prohibited from
declaring that no quarter will be given, quarter may
nevertheless be refused<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> by way of reprisal for violations
of the rules of warfare committed by the other
side; and, further, in case of imperative necessity,

be vitally imperilled.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> But it must be emphasised

safely be guarded and fed by the captors<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
furnish an exceptional case to the rule, provided that
no vital danger to the captors is therein involved. And
it must likewise be emphasised that the former rule
is now obsolete according to which quarter could be
refused to the garrison of a fortress carried by assault,
to the defenders of an unfortified place against an
attack of artillery, and to the weak garrison who obstinately
and uselessly persevered in defending a
fortified place against overwhelming enemy forces.</p>

prohibited by treaties or custom, all means of killing

And it matters not whether the means used are directed
against single individuals, as swords and rifles, or
against large bodies of individuals, as, for instance,
shrapnel, Gatlings, and mines. On the other hand,
all means are unlawful that render death inevitable or
that needlessly aggravate the sufferings of wounded
combatants. A customary rule of International Law,
now expressly enacted by article 23 (<i>e</i>) of the Hague
Regulations, prohibits, therefore, the employment of
poison and of such arms, projectiles, and material as
cause unnecessary injury. Accordingly: wells, pumps,
rivers, and the like from which the enemy draws drinking
water must not be poisoned; poisoned weapons must
not be made use of; rifles must not be loaded with bits
of glass, irregularly shaped iron, nails, and the like;
cannons must not be loaded with chain shot, crossbar
shot, red-hot balls, and the like. Another customary
rule, now likewise enacted by article 23 (<i>b</i>) of the Hague
Regulations, prohibits any treacherous way of killing
and wounding combatants. Accordingly: no assassin
must be hired and no assassination of combatants be
committed; a price may not be put on the head of
an enemy individual; proscription and outlawing are
prohibited; no treacherous request for quarter must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
be made; no treacherous simulation of sickness or
wounds is permitted.</p>

<p>§ 111. <a name="In_1868_a_conference111" id="In_1868_a_conference111"></a>In 1868 a conference met at St. Petersburg
for the examination of a proposition made by Russia
with regard to the use of explosive projectiles in war.
The representatives of seventeen Powers&mdash;namely,
Great Britain, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Bavaria,
Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Holland, Italy,
Persia, Portugal, Prussia and the North German
Confederation, Sweden-Norway, Switzerland, Turkey
and Württemberg (Brazil acceded later) signed on
December 11, 1868, the so-called Declaration of St.
Petersburg,<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> which stipulates that the signatory Powers,
and those who should accede later, renounce in case
of war between themselves the employment, by their
military and naval troops, of any projectile of a weight
below 400 grammes (14 ounces) which is either explosive
or charged with fulminating or inflammable substances.
This engagement is obligatory only upon the contracting
Powers, and it ceases to be obligatory in case
a non-contracting Power takes part in a war between
any of the contracting Powers.</p>

<p>§ 112. <a name="As_Great_Britain112" id="As_Great_Britain112"></a>As Great Britain had introduced bullets
manufactured at the Indian arsenal of Dum-Dum,
near Calcutta, the hard jacket of which did not quite
cover the core and which therefore easily expanded
and flattened in the human body, the First Hague
Peace Conference adopted a declaration signed on
July 29, 1899, by fifteen Powers&mdash;namely, Belgium,
Denmark, Spain, Mexico, France, Greece, Montenegro,
Holland, Persia, Roumania, Russia, Siam, Sweden-Norway,
Turkey, and Bulgaria&mdash;stipulating that the
contracting Powers should abstain, in case of war
between two or more of them, from the use of bullets
which expand or flatten easily in the human body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
such as bullets with hard envelopes which do not
entirely cover the core or are pierced with incisions.

<p>§ 113. <a name="The_First_Hague113" id="The_First_Hague113"></a>The First Hague Peace Conference also
adopted a Declaration, signed on July 29, 1899, by
sixteen States&mdash;namely, Belgium, Denmark, Spain,
Mexico, France, Greece, Montenegro, Holland, Persia,
Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Siam, Sweden-Norway,
Turkey and Bulgaria&mdash;stipulating that the signatory
Powers should in a war between two or more of them
abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of
which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious

<p>§ 114. <a name="The_First_Hague_Peace114" id="The_First_Hague_Peace114"></a>The First Hague Peace Conference adopted
likewise a Declaration, signed on July 29, 1899, prohibiting
<i>for a term of five years</i> the launching of
projectiles or explosives from balloons or other kinds
of aerial vessels. The Second Peace Conference, on
October 18, 1907, renewed this Declaration <i>up to the
close of the Third Peace Conference</i>, but out of twenty-seven
States which signed the Declaration only seven&mdash;namely,
Great Britain, the United States of America,
China, Holland, Bolivia, Salvador, Haiti (Nicaragua
acceded later)&mdash;ratified it, and Germany, France,
Italy, Japan, Russia&mdash;not to mention smaller Powers&mdash;did
not even sign it. There is, therefore, no doubt
that the Third Peace Conference will not renew the
Declaration. Although it is very much to be regretted,
the fact must be taken into consideration that in future
violence directed from air-vessels will play a great part
in war. For this reason, the question as to the conditions
under which such violence is admissible, is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
importance,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> but it is as yet impossible to give a satisfactory
answer. The Institute of International Law,
at its meeting at Madrid in 1911, adopted the principle<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
that <i>aerial warfare must not comprise greater danger to
the person and the property of the peaceful population than
land or sea warfare</i>. However this may be, there can
be no doubt that the general principles laid down in
the Declaration of St. Petersburg of 1868, in the two
Declarations, adopted by the First Peace Conference,
concerning expanding bullets and projectiles diffusing
asphyxiating or deleterious gases, in the Hague rules
concerning land warfare, and the like, must find application
as regards violence directed from air vessels.</p>

<p>§ 115. It will be remembered from above, § <a href="#In_the_main79">79</a>,
that numerous individuals belong to armed forces
without being combatants. Now, since and in so far
as these non-combatant members of armed forces do
not take part in the fighting, they may not directly
be attacked and killed or wounded. However, they
are exposed to all injuries indirectly resulting from the
operations of warfare. And, with the exception of the
personnel<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> engaged in the interest of the wounded,
such as doctors, chaplains, persons employed in military
hospitals, official ambulance men, who, according
to articles 9 and 10 of the Geneva Convention, are
specially privileged, such non-combatant members of
armed forces may certainly be made prisoners, since
the assistance they give to the fighting forces may be
of great importance.</p>

persons of either sex could be killed or otherwise badly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
treated according to discretion, and whereas in especial
the inhabitants of fortified places taken by assault
used to be abandoned to the mercy of the assailants,
in the eighteenth century it became a universally recognised
customary rule of the Law of Nations that
private enemy individuals should not be killed or
attacked. In so far as they do not take part in the
fighting, they may not be directly attacked and killed
or wounded. They are, however, like non-combatant
members of the armed forces, exposed to all injuries
indirectly resulting from the operations of warfare.
Thus, for instance, when a town is bombarded and
thousands of inhabitants are thereby killed, or when a
train carrying private individuals as well as soldiers
is wrecked by a mine, no violation of the rule prohibiting
attack on private enemy persons has taken place.</p>

IX.</p></div>

<p>As regards captivity, the rule is that private enemy
persons may not be made prisoners of war. But this
rule has exceptions conditioned by the carrying out
of certain military operations, the safety of the armed
forces, and the order and tranquillity of occupied enemy
territory. Thus, for instance, influential enemy citizens
who try to incite their fellow-citizens to take up arms
may be arrested and deported into captivity. And even
the whole population of a province may be imprisoned
in case a levy <i>en masse</i> is threatening.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_244_244" id="Footnote_244_244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_244_244"><span class="label">[244]</span></a> Civilians who render assistance
to the enemy as drivers, or as
labourers to construct fortifications
or siege works, or in a similar way, if
captured while they are so engaged,
may not be detained as prisoners
of war, whether they render these
services voluntarily or are requisitioned
or hired. See <i>Land Warfare</i>,
§ 58 note (<i>a</i>).</p></div>

<p>Apart from captivity, restrictions of all sorts may
be imposed upon, and means of force may be applied
against, private enemy persons for many purposes.
Such purposes are:&mdash;the keeping of order and tranquillity
on occupied enemy territory; the prevention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of any hostile conduct, especially conspiracies; the
prevention of intercourse with and assistance to the
enemy forces; the securing of the fulfilment of commands
and requests of the military authorities, such as
those for the provision of drivers, hostages, farriers;
the securing of compliance with requisitions and contributions,
of the execution of public works necessary
for military operations, such as the building of fortifications,
roads, bridges, soldiers' quarters, and the
like. What kind of violent means may be applied
for these purposes is in the discretion of the respective
military authorities, who on their part will act according
to expediency and the rules of martial law established
by the belligerents. But there is no doubt that,
if necessary, capital punishment and imprisonment<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> are
lawful means for these purposes. The essence of the
position of private individuals in modern warfare with
regard to violence against them finds expression in
article 46 of the Hague Regulations, which lays down
the rule that "family honours and rights, individual
lives and private property, as well as religious convictions
and liberty, must be respected."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_245_245" id="Footnote_245_245"></a><a href="#FNanchor_245_245"><span class="label">[245]</span></a> That in case of general devastation
the peaceful population may be
detained in so-called concentration
camps, there is no doubt; see below,
§ <a href="#The_question_must154">154</a>. And there is likewise no
doubt that hostages may be taken
from the peaceful population; see
below, § <a href="#An_occupant_having170">170</a>, p. 213, and

to that of private enemy persons. But they are so important
to the enemy State, and they may be so useful
to the enemy and so dangerous to the invading forces,
that they may certainly be made prisoners of war. If
a belligerent succeeds in obtaining possession of the
head of the enemy State or its Cabinet Ministers, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
will certainly remove them into captivity. And he
may do the same with diplomatic agents and other
officials of importance, because by weakening the enemy
Government he may thereby influence the enemy to
agree to terms of peace.</p>

several hundreds of special treaties have been concluded
between different States regarding the tending
of each other's wounded and the exemption of army
surgeons from captivity, no general rule of the Law
of Nations on these points was in existence until the
second half of the nineteenth century other than one
prohibiting the killing, mutilation, or ill-treatment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the wounded. A change for the better was initiated
by Jean Henry Dunant, a Swiss citizen from Geneva,
who was an eye-witness of the battle of Solferino in
1859, where many thousands of wounded died who
could, under more favourable circumstances, have been
saved. When he published, in 1861 and 1863, his
pamphlet, <i>Un Souvenir de Solférino</i>, the Geneva <i>Société
d'utilité publique</i>, under the presidency of Gustave
Moynier, created an agitation in favour of better
arrangements for the tending of the wounded on the
battlefield, and convoked an international congress at
Geneva in 1863, where thirty-six representatives of
nearly all the European States met and discussed the
matter. In 1864 the Bundesrath, the Government
of the Federal State of Switzerland, took the matter
in hand officially, and invited all European and several
American States to send official representatives to a
Congress at Geneva for the purpose of discussing and
concluding an international treaty regarding the
wounded. This Congress met in 1864, and sixteen
States were represented. Its result was the international
"Convention<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> for the Amelioration of the
Condition of Soldiers wounded in Armies in the Field,"
commonly called "Geneva Convention," signed on
August 22, 1864. By-and-by States other than the
original signatories joined the Convention, and finally
the whole body of the civilised States of the world,
with the exception of Costa Rica, Monaco, and Lichtenstein,
became parties. That the rules of the Convention
were in no wise perfect, and needed to be supplemented
regarding many points, soon became apparent. A
second International Congress met at the invitation
of Switzerland in 1868 at Geneva, where additional
articles<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> to the original Convention were discussed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
signed. These additional articles have, however, never
been ratified. The First Hague Peace Conference in
1899 unanimously formulated the wish that Switzerland
should shortly take steps for the assemblage of another
international congress in order to revise the Geneva
Convention. This Congress assembled in June 1906,
thirty-five States having sent representatives, and on
July 6, 1906, a new Geneva Convention<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> was signed
by Great Britain, Germany, Argentina, Austria-Hungary,
Belgium, Bulgaria, Chili, China, Congo Free
State, Korea, Denmark, Spain, the United States of
America, Brazil, Mexico, France, Greece, Guatemala,
Honduras, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, Montenegro,
Norway, Holland, Peru, Persia, Portugal, Roumania,
Russia, Servia, Siam, Sweden, Switzerland, and
Uruguay. Most of these States have already ratified,
and Colombia, Costa-Rica, Cuba, Nicaragua, Salvador,
Turkey, and Venezuela, which were not represented at
the Congress, acceded later. There is no doubt that
in time all the civilised Powers will become parties.</p>

<p>The new Convention consists of thirty-three articles
instead of the ten articles of the old Convention, and
provides rules for the treatment of the wounded and
the dead; further rules concerning military hospitals
and mobile medical units; the personnel engaged in the
interest of the wounded including army chaplains; the
material belonging to mobile medical units, military
hospitals, and voluntary aid societies; the convoys of
evacuation; the distinctive emblem; the carrying

<p>In the final protocol the Conference expresses the

as the cases and the circumstances permit, submit to

Convention,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> the sick and wounded persons belonging,
or officially attached, to armies must be respected and
taken care of, without distinction of nationality, by
the belligerent in whose power they may be. Should,
however, a belligerent necessarily be compelled to
abandon such sick and wounded persons to the enemy,
he must, so far as military exigencies permit, leave
behind with them a portion of his medical personnel
to take care of them, and the necessary material. The
sick and wounded who have fallen into the hands of
the enemy are prisoners of war, but belligerents may
exchange or release them, or even hand them over
to a neutral State which has to intern them until after
the conclusion of peace. After each engagement the
commander in possession of the field must have search
made for the wounded and must take measures to
protect them against pillage and maltreatment. A
nominal roll of all wounded and sick who have been
collected must be sent as early as possible to the
authorities of the country or army to which they belong,
and the belligerents must keep each other mutually
informed of any internments and changes as well as
of admissions into hospital. It is specially stipulated
by article 5 that, if a military authority finds it necessary
to appeal to the charitable zeal of the inhabitants to
collect and take care of, under his direction, the wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Medical
Units and
Establishments,
and
Material.</p></div>

<p>§ 120. In order that the wounded and sick may
receive proper treatment, mobile medical units as well
as the fixed establishments of the medical service must
be respected and protected by the belligerents, but this
protection ceases if these units and establishments
are made use of to commit acts harmful to the enemy,
for instance, to shelter combatants, to carry on
espionage, to conceal arms and ammunition (articles
6 and 7). But article 8 expressly enacts that the units
and establishments do not forego protection:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) in
case the personnel is armed and use their arms for
their own defence or for the defence of the wounded
and sick under their charge; (<i>b</i>) in case, in default of
armed orderlies, units or establishments are guarded
by pickets or by sentinels furnished with authority in
due form; (<i>c</i>) in case weapons and cartridges, taken
from the wounded and not yet handed over to the
proper department, are found in units or establishments.</p>

<p>As regards the <i>material</i>, a distinction is drawn between
the treatment of the material of mobile medical
units, of fixed medical establishments, and of material
belonging to Voluntary Aid Societies.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Mobile medical units which fall into the hands
of the enemy must not be deprived of their material,
including their teams, whatever may be the means of
transport and whoever may be the drivers employed
(article 14). The competent military authority is,
however, permitted to make use of the material in
captured medical units for the treatment of the wounded
and the sick at hand, provided it is restored under the
same conditions, and so far as possible at the same
time, as laid down for the release of the medical personnel
by article 12.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The buildings and material of fixed medical
establishments which, because the locality where they
are is militarily occupied, fall into the hands of the
enemy, remain, according to article 15, "subject to
the laws of war," that means they remain entirely in
the power of the captor, but they may not be diverted
from their medical purpose so long as they are necessary
for the proper treatment of the wounded and the sick.
Should, however, urgent military necessity demand it,
a commander may dispose of them, provided he makes
previous arrangements for the welfare of the wounded
and sick found in the fixed establishments.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The material of Voluntary Aid Societies, which
are duly recognised, is, according to article 16, considered
private property and must, therefore, be respected
as such under all circumstances, although it
may be requisitioned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Personnel.</p></div>

<p>§ 121. <a name="The_personnel121" id="The_personnel121"></a>The personnel engaged exclusively in the
collection, transport, and treatment of the wounded
and sick, as well as in the administration of mobile
medical units and establishments, the chaplains attached
to armies, and, lastly, pickets and sentinels
guarding medical units and establishments, must,
according to article 9, under all circumstances be respected
and protected. If they fall into the hands of
the enemy they must not be treated as prisoners of
war. According to article 12, however, they are not
free to act or move without let or hindrance, for, if
their assistance is indispensable, they may be called
upon by the captor to carry on their duties to the
wounded and the sick. But when their assistance is
no longer indispensable, they must be sent back to their
army or to their country at such time and by such
route as may be compatible with military exigencies,
and they must be allowed to take with them such
effects, instruments, arms, and horses as are their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
private property. So long as they are detained by
the enemy he must, according to article 13, grant
them the same allowances and the same pay as are
due to the personnel holding the same rank in his
own army.</p>

<p>The personnel of Voluntary Aid Societies employed in
the medical units and establishments is, according to
article 10, privileged to the same extent as the official
personnel, provided that the Voluntary Aid Society
concerned is duly recognised and authorised by its
Government and that the personnel of the Society is
subject to military law and regulations. Each State
must notify to the other, either in time of peace or at
the commencement, or during the course, of hostilities,
but in every case before actually employing them, the
names of societies which it has authorised to render
assistance to the regular medical service of its armies.
A recognised Voluntary Aid Society of a <i>neutral</i> country
cannot, according to article 11, afford the assistance of
its personnel and units to a belligerent unless it has
previously received the consent of its own Government
and of the belligerent concerned. And a belligerent
who accepts such assistance from a Voluntary Aid
Society of a neutral country is bound, before making
any use of it, to notify the fact to the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Convoys
of Evacuation.</p></div>

<p>§ 122. Convoys used for evacuating the wounded and
sick must, as regards their personnel and material, be
treated in the same way as mobile medical units, but
subject to the following special provisions enacted by
article 17:&mdash;</p>

<p>A belligerent intercepting a convoy may, if military
exigencies demand, break it up, provided he takes
charge of the sick and wounded who are in it. In this
case, the obligation to send back the medical personnel,
provided for in article 12, must be extended to the
whole of the military personnel detailed for the transport<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
or the protection of the convoy and furnished
with an authority in due form to that effect.</p>

<p>The obligation to restore the medical material,
provided for in article 14, must apply to railway trains
and boats used in internal navigation, which are
specially arranged for evacuation, as well as to the
material belonging to the medical service for fitting up
ordinary vehicles, trains, and boats. Military vehicles,
other than those of the medical service, however, may
be captured with their teams; and the civilian personnel
and the various means of transport obtained by
requisition, including railway material and boats used
for convoys, are subject to the general rules of International
Law concerning war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Distinctive
Emblem.</p></div>

<p>§ 123. According to article 18 the Swiss heraldic
device of the red cross on a white ground, formed by
reversing the federal colours, is adopted as the emblem
and distinctive sign of the medical service of armies,
but there is no objection to the adoption of another
emblem on the part of such non-Christian States as
object to the cross on religious grounds. Thus Turkey
has substituted a red crescent, and Persia a red sun
for the cross.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The following are the rules concerning
the use of this emblem:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The emblem must be shown on the flags and the
armlets (<i>brassards</i>) as well as on all the material belonging
to the medical service, but the emblem cannot
be recognised unless it is used with the permission of
the competent military authority (article 19).</p>

<p>(2) Medical units and establishments must hoist the
red cross flag accompanied by the national flag of the
belligerent concerned (article 21), but medical units
which have fallen into the hands of the enemy must
not, so long as they are in that situation, fly any other
flag than that of the red cross. The medical units<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
belonging to neutral countries which have, in accordance
with article 11, been admitted to afford their
services, must fly, along with the red cross flag, the
national flag of the belligerent to whose army they are
attached (article 22).</p>

<p>(3) All the personnel must, according to article 20,
wear, fixed to the left arm, an armlet (<i>brassard</i>) with a
red cross on a white ground, delivered and stamped
by the competent military authority and accompanied
by a certificate of identity in the case of persons who
are attached to the medical service and armies without
wearing the military uniform.</p>

<p>(4) The employment of the red cross on a white
ground and the words "Red Cross" or "Geneva
Cross" must not, according to article 23, be used,
either in time of peace or in time of war, except to
indicate the protected medical units, establishments,
personnel, and material.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Treatment

<p>§ 124. <a name="According_to124" id="According_to124"></a>According to a customary rule of the Law of
Nations belligerents have the right to demand from one
another that dead soldiers shall not be disgracefully
treated, especially not mutilated, and shall be, so far
as possible, collected and buried<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> or cremated on the
battlefield by the victor. The Geneva Convention does
not stipulate any rule concerning the collection and
burial or cremation of the dead, but article 3 enacts
that after each engagement the commander in possession
of the field must take measures to ensure protection
of the dead against pillage and maltreatment,
and that a careful examination of the bodies, in order
to see that life is really extinct, must be made before
the dead are buried or cremated. Each belligerent
must send as soon as possible to the authorities of the
country or army to which they belong the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>

(article 4). Pieces of equipment found upon the dead
of the enemy are public enemy property and may,
therefore, be appropriated as booty<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> by the victor.
On the other hand, letters, money, jewellery, and such
other articles of value found upon the dead on the
battlefield, or on those who die in the medical units or
fixed establishments, as are apparently private property,
are not booty, but must, according to article 4 of the
Geneva Convention and article 14 of the Hague rules
concerning warfare on land, be collected and handed
over to the Bureau of Information<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> concerning the

are only binding in the case of war between two or
more of the contracting parties, they cease to be binding
from the moment when one of the belligerent Powers

of the belligerent armies must, in accordance with the
instructions of their Governments and in conformity
with the general principles of the Geneva Convention,
arrange the details for carrying out the articles of the
Geneva Convention, as well as for cases not provided
for in these articles (article 25). The contracting
parties must take the necessary measures to instruct
their troops, especially the personnel protected by
the Geneva Convention, in the provisions of the Convention,
and to bring these provisions to the notice
of the civil population (article 26). In countries
whose legislation is not at the time of the signing of
the Convention adequate for the purpose, the contracting
parties must adopt such measures as may be
necessary to prevent, at all times, the employment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>

Cross" by private individuals or by Societies other
than those which are entitled to do so according to
the Geneva Convention, and in particular for commercial
purposes as a trade mark or trading mark
(article 27). The contracting Governments must likewise
adopt measures necessary for the repression in
time of war of individual acts of pillage and maltreatment
of the wounded and sick, as well as for the
punishment of the improper use of the Red Cross flag
and armlet (<i>brassard</i>) by officers and soldiers or private
individuals not protected by the Geneva Convention.
They must, at the latest within five years from the ratification
of the Geneva Convention, communicate to one
another through the Swiss Federal Council, the provisions
concerning these measures of repression (article 28).<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Development
of
International
Law
regarding
Captivity.</p></div>

<p>§ 125. During antiquity, prisoners of war could
be killed, and they were very often at once actually
butchered or offered as sacrifices to the gods. If they
were spared, they were as a rule made slaves and only
exceptionally liberated. But belligerents also exchanged
their prisoners or liberated them for ransom.
During the first part of the Middle Ages prisoners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
war could likewise be killed or made slaves. Under
the influence of Christianity, however, their fate in time
became mitigated. Although they were often most
cruelly treated during the second part of the Middle
Ages, they were not as a rule killed and, with the disappearance
of slavery in Europe, they were no longer
enslaved. By the time modern International Law
gradually came into existence, killing and enslaving
prisoners of war had disappeared, but they were still
often treated as criminals and as objects of personal revenge.
They were not considered in the power of the
State by whose forces they were captured, but in the
power of those very forces or of the individual soldiers
that had made the capture. And it was considered
lawful on the part of captors to make as much profit
as possible out of their prisoners by way of ransom,
provided no exchange of prisoners took place. So
general was this practice that a more or less definite
scale of ransom became usual. Thus, Grotius (III.
c. 14, § 9) mentions that in his time the ransom of a
private was the amount of his one month's pay. And
since the pecuniary value of a prisoner as regards
ransom rose in proportion with his fortune and his
position in life and in the enemy army, it became usual
for prisoners of rank and note not to belong to the
capturing forces but to the Sovereign, who had, however,
to recompense the captors. During the seventeenth
century, the custom that prisoners were considered
in the power of their captors died away. They were
now considered to be in the power of the Sovereign
by whose forces they were captured. But rules of
the Law of Nations regarding their proper treatment
were hardly in existence. The practice of liberating
prisoners in exchange, or for ransom only, continued.
Special cartels were often concluded at the outbreak
of or during a war for the purpose of stipulating a scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of ransom according to which either belligerent could
redeem his soldiers and officers from captivity. The
last<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> instance of such cartels is that between England
and France in 1780, stipulating the ransom for members
of the naval and military forces of both belligerents.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_256_256" id="Footnote_256_256"></a><a href="#FNanchor_256_256"><span class="label">[256]</span></a> See Hall, § 134, p. 428, note 1.</p></div>

<p>It was not until the eighteenth century, with its
general tendencies to mitigate the cruel practices of
warfare, that matters changed for the better. The
conviction in time became general that captivity
should only be the means of preventing prisoners from
returning to their corps and taking up arms again,
and should, as a matter of principle, be distinguished
from imprisonment as a punishment for crimes. The
Treaty of Friendship<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> concluded in 1785 between
Prussia and the United States of America was probably
the first to stipulate (article 24) the proper treatment
of prisoners of war, prohibiting confinement in convict
prisons and the use of irons, and insisting upon their
confinement in a healthy place, where they may have
exercise, and where they may be kept and fed as troops.
During the nineteenth century the principle that
prisoners of war should be treated by their captor in
a manner analogous to that meted out to his own
troops became generally recognised, and the Hague
Regulations have now, by articles 4 to 20, enacted
exhaustive rules regarding captivity.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_257_257" id="Footnote_257_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_257_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> See Martens, <i>N.R.</i> IV. p. 37.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Treatment
of
Prisoners
of War.</p></div>

<p>§ 126. According to articles 4-7 and 16-19 of the
Hague Regulations prisoners of war are not in the
power of the individuals or corps who capture them,
but in the power of the Government of the captor.
They must be humanely treated. All their personal
belongings remain their property, with the exception
of arms, horses, and military papers, which are booty;<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
and in practice<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> personal belongings are understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
to include military uniform, clothing, and kit required for
personal use, although technically they are Government
property. They may only be imprisoned as an unavoidable
matter of safety, and only while the circumstances
which necessitate the measure continue to exist.
They may, therefore, be detained in a town, fortress,
camp, or any other locality, and they may be bound
not to go beyond a certain fixed boundary. But they
may not be kept in convict prisons. Except in the case
of officers, their labour may be utilised by the Government
according to their rank and aptitude, but their
tasks must not be excessive and must have nothing to
do with military operations. Work done by them for
the State must be paid for in accordance with tariffs
in force for soldiers of the national army employed on
similar tasks, or, in case there are no such tariffs in
force, at rates proportional to the work executed. But
prisoners of war may also be authorised to work for
other branches of the public service or for private
persons under conditions of employment to be settled
by the military authorities, and they may likewise
be authorised to work on their own account. All
wages they receive go towards improving their position,
and a balance must be paid to them at the time of
their release, after deducting the cost of their maintenance.
But whether they earn wages or not, the
Government is bound under all circumstances to
maintain them, and provide quarters, food, and clothing
for them on the same footing as for its own troops.
Officer prisoners must receive the same pay as officers
of corresponding rank in the country where they are
detained, the amount to be repaid by their Government
after the conclusion of peace. All prisoners of war
must enjoy every latitude in the exercise of their
religion, including attendance at their own church
service, provided only they comply with the regulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
for order issued by the military authorities. If a
prisoner wants to make a will, it must be received by
the authorities or drawn up on the same conditions as
for soldiers of the national army. And the same rules
are valid regarding death certificates and the burial of
prisoners of war, and due regard must be paid to their

members of armed forces, such as newspaper

who are captured and detained, may claim to be treated
as prisoners of war, provided they can produce a

<div class="sidenote"><p>Discipline.</p></div>

<p>§ 128. Articles 8 and 9 of the Hague Regulations
lay down the discipline to be observed in the case of
prisoners of war in the following way:&mdash;Every prisoner
who, if questioned, does not declare his true name
and rank is liable to a curtailment of the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
accorded to prisoners of his class. All prisoners are
subject to the laws, regulations, and orders in force in
the army of the belligerent that keeps them in captivity.
Any act of insubordination on the part of prisoners
may be punished in accordance with these laws,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> but
apart from these laws, all kinds of severe measures are
admissible to prevent a repetition of such acts. Escaped
prisoners, who, after having rejoined their national
army, are again taken prisoners, are not liable to any
punishment for their flight. But if they are recaptured
before they succeed in rejoining their army, or before
they have quitted the territory occupied by the capturing
forces, they are liable to disciplinary punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Release
on Parole.</p></div>

<p>§ 129. <a name="Articles129" id="Articles129"></a>Articles 10 to 12 of the Hague Regulations
deal with release on parole in the following manner:&mdash;No
belligerent is obliged to assent to a prisoner's request
to be released on parole, and no prisoner may
be forced to accept such release. But if the laws of
his country authorise him to do so, and if he acquiesces,
any prisoner may be released on parole. In such case
he is in honour bound scrupulously to fulfil the engagement
he has contracted, both as regards his own
Government and the Government that released him.
And his own Government is formally bound neither to
request, nor to accept, from him any service incompatible
with the parole given. Any prisoner released
on parole and recaptured bearing arms against the
belligerent who released him, or against such belligerent's
allies, forfeits the privilege to be treated as a
prisoner of war, and may be tried by court-martial.
The Hague Regulations do not lay down the punishment
for such breach of parole, but according to a
customary rule of International Law the punishment
may be capital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

grant facilities to Relief Societies to serve as intermediaries
for charity to prisoners of war. The condition
of the admission of such societies and their agents
is that the former are regularly constituted in accordance
with the law of their country. Delegates of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
societies may be admitted to the places of internment
for the distribution of relief, as also to the halting-places

the military authorities, provided they give an engagement
in writing that they will comply with all regulations
by the authorities for order and police.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>End of

<p>§ 132. <a name="Captivity_can_come132" id="Captivity_can_come132"></a>Captivity can come to an end through
different modes. Apart from release on parole, which
has already been mentioned, captivity comes to an
end&mdash;(1) through simple release without parole; (2)
through successful flight; (3) through liberation by
the invading enemy to whose army the respective
prisoners belong; (4) through exchange for prisoners
taken by the enemy; (5) through prisoners<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> being
brought into neutral territory by captors who take
refuge there; and, lastly (6), through the war coming
to an end. Release of prisoners for ransom is no
longer practised, except in the case of the crew of a
captured merchantman released on a ransom bill.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
It ought, however, to be observed that the practice
of ransoming prisoners might be revived if convenient,
provided the ransom is to be paid not to the individual
captor but to the belligerent whose forces made the
capture.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_265_265" id="Footnote_265_265"></a><a href="#FNanchor_265_265"><span class="label">[265]</span></a> See

below, § <a href="#Although_prizes195">195</a>.</p></div>

<p>As regards the end of captivity through the war
coming to an end, a distinction must be made according
to the different modes of ending war. If the war ends
by peace being concluded, captivity comes to an end
at once<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> with the conclusion of peace, and, as article 20
of the Hague Regulations expressly enacts, the repatriation
of prisoners must be effected as speedily as
possible. If, however, the war ends through conquest
and annexation of the vanquished State, captivity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
comes to an end as soon as peace is established. It
ought to end with annexation, and it will in most cases
do so. But as guerilla war may well go on after conquest
and annexation, and thus prevent a condition of
peace from being established, although real warfare is
over, it is necessary not to confound annexation with
peace.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The point is of interest regarding such prisoners
only as are subjects of neutral States. For other
prisoners become through annexation subjects of the
State that keeps them in captivity, and such State is,
therefore, as far as International Law is concerned,
unrestricted in taking any measure it likes with regard
to them. It can repatriate them, and it will in most
cases do so. But if it thinks that they might endanger
its hold over the conquered territory, it might likewise
prevent their repatriation for any definite or indefinite
period.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

belligerents could appropriate all public and private<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
enemy property they found on enemy territory. This
rule is now obsolete. Its place is taken by several
rules, since distinctions are to be made between moveable
and immoveable property, public and private
property, and, further, between different kinds of
private and public property. These rules must be
discussed <i>seriatim</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_270_270" id="Footnote_270_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270_270"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> It is impossible for a treatise to go into historical
details, and to show the gradual disappearance of the old rule. But it
is of importance to state the fact, that even during the nineteenth
century&mdash;see, for instance, G. F. Martens, II. § 280; Twiss, II. § 64;
Hall, § 139&mdash;it was asserted that in strict law all private enemy
moveable property was as much booty as public property, although the
growth of a usage was recognised which under certain conditions exempted
it from appropriation. In the face of articles 46 and 47 of the Hague
Regulations these assertions have no longer any basis, and all the
text-books of the nineteenth century are now antiquated with regard to
this matter.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Immoveable
Public
Property.</p></div>

<p>§ 134. Appropriation of public immoveables is not
lawful so long as the territory on which they are has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
not become State property of the occupant through
annexation. During mere military occupation of the
enemy territory, a belligerent may not sell or otherwise
alienate public enemy land and buildings, but only
appropriate the produce of them. Article 55 of the
Hague Regulations expressly enacts that a belligerent
occupying enemy territory shall only be regarded as
administrator and usufructuary of the public buildings,
real property, forests, and agricultural works belonging
to the hostile State and situated on the occupied
territory; that he must protect the stock and plant,
and that he must administer them according to the
rules of usufruct. He may, therefore, sell the crop
from public land, cut timber in the public forests and
sell it, may let public land and buildings for the time
of his occupation, and the like. He is, however, only
usufructuary, and he is, therefore, prohibited from
exercising his right in a wasteful or negligent way
that would decrease the value of the stock and plant.
Thus, for instance, he must not cut down a whole
forest unless the necessities of war compel him.</p>

<p>§ 135. It must, however, be observed that the
produce of such public immoveables only as belong
to the State itself may be appropriated, but not the
produce of those belonging to municipalities or of
those which, although they belong to the hostile State,
are permanently set aside for religious purposes, for the
maintenance of charitable and educational institutions,
and for the benefit of art and science. Article 56 of
the Hague Regulations expressly enacts that such
property is to be treated as private property.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Utilisation
of
Public
Buildings.</p></div>

<p>§ 136. So far as the necessities of war demand,
a belligerent may make use of public enemy buildings
for all kinds of purposes. Troops must be housed,
horses stabled, the sick and wounded nursed. Public
buildings may in the first instance, therefore, be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
use of for such purposes, although they may thereby
be considerably damaged. And it matters not whether
the buildings belong to the enemy State or to municipalities,
whether they are regularly destined for ordinary
governmental and municipal purposes, or for religious,
educational, scientific, and the like purposes. Thus,
churches may be converted into hospitals, schools into
barracks, buildings used for scientific research into
stables. But it must be observed that such utilisation
of public buildings as damages them is justified only if
it is necessary. A belligerent who turned a picture
gallery into stables without being compelled thereto
would certainly commit a violation of the Law of
Nations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Moveable
Public
Property.</p></div>

<p>§ 137. Moveable public enemy property may certainly
be appropriated by a belligerent provided that it can
directly or indirectly be useful for military operations.
Article 53 of the Hague Regulations unmistakably
enacts that a belligerent occupying hostile territory
may take possession of the cash, funds, realisable
securities, depôts of arms, means of transport, stores,
supplies, appliances on land or at sea or in the air
adapted for the transmission of news or for the transport
of persons or goods, and of all other moveable
property of the hostile State which may be used for
military operations. Thus, a belligerent is entitled to
seize not only the money and funds of the hostile State
on the one hand, and, on the other, munitions of war,
depôts of arms, stores and supplies, but also the rolling-stock
of public railways<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> and other means of transport
and everything and anything he can directly or indirectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
make use of for military operations. He may,
for instance, seize a quantity of cloth for the purpose of
clothing his soldiers.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_271_271" id="Footnote_271_271"></a><a href="#FNanchor_271_271"><span class="label">[271]</span></a> See Nowacki, <i>Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege</i> (1906), §§ 15 and
19. Some writers&mdash;see, for instance, Bonfils, No. 1185, and Wehberg,
<i>op. cit.</i> p. 22&mdash;maintain that such rolling stock may not be
appropriated, but may only be made use of during war and must be
restored after the conclusion of peace. The assertion that article 53,
second paragraph, is to be interpreted in that sense, is unfounded, for
restoration is there stipulated for such means of transport and the like
as are <i>private</i> property.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Moveable

<p>§ 138. But exceptions similar to those regarding the
usufruct of public immoveables are valid in the case of
the appropriation of public moveables. Article 56 of
the Hague Regulations enumerates the property of
municipalities, of religious, charitable, educational
institutions, and of those of science and art. Thus
the moveable property of churches, hospitals, schools,
universities, museums, picture galleries, even when
belonging to the hostile State, is exempt from appropriation
by a belligerent. As regards archives, they
are no doubt institutions for science, but a belligerent
may nevertheless seize such State papers deposited
therein as are of importance to him in connection with
the war. The last instances of the former practice
are presented by Napoleon I., who seized works of art
during his numerous wars and had them taken to the
galleries of Paris. But they had to be restored to their
former owners in 1815.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Booty

Battlefield.</p></div>

<p>§ 139. <a name="The_case_of_moveable139" id="The_case_of_moveable139"></a>The case of moveable enemy property found
by an invading belligerent on enemy territory is different
from the case of moveable enemy property on the
battlefield. According to a former rule of the Law
of Nations all enemy property, public or private,
which a belligerent could get hold of on the battlefield
was booty and could be appropriated. Although
some modern publicists<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> who wrote before the Hague
Peace Conference of 1899 teach the validity of this rule,
it is obvious from articles 4 and 14 of the Hague Regulations
that it is now obsolete as regards <i>private</i><a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
enemy property except military papers, arms, horses,
and the like. But as regards <i>public</i> enemy property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
this customary rule is still valid. Thus weapons,
munition, and valuable pieces of equipment which are
found upon the dead, the wounded, and the prisoners,
whether they are public or private property, may be
seized, as may also the war-chest and State papers in
possession of a captured commander, enemy horses,
batteries, carts, and everything else that is of value.
To whom the booty ultimately belongs is not for
International but for Municipal Law<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> to determine,
since International Law simply states that public
enemy property on the battlefield can be appropriated
by belligerents. And it must be specially observed
that the restriction of article 53 of the Hague Regulations
according to which only such moveable property
may be appropriated as can be used for the operations
of war, does not find application in the case of moveable
property found on the battlefield, for article 53 speaks
of "an army of occupation" only. Such property may
be appropriated, whether it can be used for military
operations or not; the mere fact that it was seized on

<div class="sidenote"><p>Immoveable
Private
Property.</p></div>

<p>§ 140. Immoveable private enemy property may
under no circumstances or conditions be appropriated
by an invading belligerent. Should he confiscate and
sell private land or buildings, the buyer would acquire
no right<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> whatever to the property. Article 46 of the
Hague Regulations expressly enacts that "private
property may not be confiscated." But confiscation
differs from the temporary use of private land and
buildings for all kinds of purposes demanded by the
necessities of war. What has been said above in
§ 136 with regard to utilisation of public buildings finds
equal application<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> to private buildings. If necessary
they may be converted into hospitals, barracks, and
stables without indemnification of the proprietors, and
they may also be converted into fortifications. A
humane belligerent will not drive the wretched inhabitants
into the street if he can help it. But under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the pressure of necessity he may be obliged to do this,
and he is certainly not prohibited from doing it.</p>

<p>§ 141. All kinds of private moveable property

carts, and horses, may be seized and made use of for
military purposes by an invading belligerent, but they
must be restored at the conclusion of peace, and indemnities
must be paid for them. This is expressly
enacted by article 53 of the Hague Regulations. It is
evident that the seizure of such material must be
duly acknowledged by receipt, although article 53 does
not say so; for otherwise how could indemnities be
paid after the conclusion of peace? As regards the
question who is to pay the indemnities, Holland (<i>War</i>,
No. 113) correctly maintains that "the Treaty of Peace
must settle upon whom the burden of making compensation
is ultimately to fall."</p>

<p>§ 145. The case of private property found by a
belligerent on enemy territory differs from the case
of such property brought during time of war into the
territory of a belligerent. That private enemy property
on a belligerent's territory at the time of the outbreak
of war may not be confiscated has already been stated
above in § <a href="#In_former_times_all102">102</a>. Taking this fact into consideration,
as well as the other fact that private property found on
enemy territory is nowadays likewise as a rule exempt
from confiscation, there can be no doubt that private
enemy property brought into a belligerent's territory
during time of war may not, as a rule, be confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
On the other hand, a belligerent may prohibit the withdrawal
of those articles of property which can be
made use of by the enemy for military purposes, such
as arms, ammunition, provisions, and the like. And in
analogy with article 53 of the Hague Regulations there
can be no doubt that a belligerent may seize such articles
and make use of them for military purposes, provided
that he restores them at the conclusion of peace and
pays indemnities for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>War must

War.</p></div>

<p>§ 146. Requisitions and contributions in war are
the outcome of the eternal principle that war must
support war.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> This means that every belligerent may
make his enemy pay as far as possible for the continuation
of the war. But this principle, though it is as old
as war and will only die with war itself, has not the
same effect in modern times on the actions of belligerents
as it formerly had. For thousands of years
belligerents used to appropriate all private and public
enemy property they could obtain, and, when modern
International Law grew up, this practice found legal
sanction. But after the end of the seventeenth century
this practice grew milder under the influence of the
experience that the provisioning of armies in enemy
territory became more or less impossible when the
inhabitants were treated according to the old principle.
Although belligerents retained in strict law the right to
appropriate all private besides all public property, it
became usual to abstain from enforcing such right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and in lieu thereof to impose contributions of cash
and requisitions in kind upon the inhabitants of the
invaded country.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> And when this usage developed,
no belligerent ever thought of paying in cash for requisitions,
or giving a receipt for them. But in the
nineteenth century another practice became usual.
Commanders then often gave a receipt for contributions
and requisitions, in order to avoid abuse and to
prevent further demands for fresh contributions and
requisitions by succeeding commanders without knowledge
of the former impositions. And there are instances
of cases during the nineteenth century on
record in which belligerents actually paid in cash for
all requisitions they made. The usual practice at the
end of the nineteenth century was that commanders
always gave a receipt for contributions, and that they
either paid in cash for requisitions or acknowledged
them by receipt, so that the respective inhabitants
could be indemnified by their own Government after
conclusion of peace. However, no restriction whatever
was imposed upon commanders with regard to the
amount of contributions and requisitions, and with
regard to the proportion between the resources of a
country and the burden imposed. The Hague Regulations
have now settled the matter of contributions
and requisitions in a progressive way by enacting
rules which put the whole matter on a new basis.
That war must support war remains a principle under
these regulations also. But they are widely influenced
by the demand that the enemy State as such, and not
the private enemy individuals, should be made to support
the war, and that only so far as the necessities of
war demand it should contributions and requisitions be
imposed. Although certain public moveable property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
and the produce of public immoveables may be appropriated
as heretofore, requisitions must be paid for in
cash or, if this is impossible, acknowledged by receipt.</p>

development of the practice of
requisitions and contributions is
given by Keller, <i>Requisition und
Kontribution</i> (1898), pp. 5-26.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Requisitions
in
Kind, and
Quartering.</p></div>

<p>§ 147. <a name="Requisition_is_the_name147" id="Requisition_is_the_name147"></a>Requisition is the name for the demand for
the supply of all kinds of articles necessary for an
army, such as provisions for men and horses, clothing,
or means of transport. Requisition of certain services
may also be made, but they will be treated below in
§ <a href="#An_occupant_having170">170</a> together with occupation, requisitions in kind
only being within the scope of this section. Now,
what articles may be demanded by an army cannot once
for all be laid down, as they depend upon the actual
need of an army. According to article 52 of the Hague
Regulations, requisitions may be made from municipalities
as well as from inhabitants, but they may be
made so far only as they are really necessary for the
army. They may not be made by individual soldiers
or officers, but only by the commander in the locality.
All requisitions must be paid for in cash, and if this
is impossible, they must be acknowledged by receipt,
and the payment of the amount must be made as soon
as possible. The principle that requisitions must be
paid for by the enemy is thereby absolutely recognised,
but, of course, commanders-in-chief may levy contributions&mdash;see
below, § <a href="#Contribution_is_a_payment148">148</a>&mdash;in case they do not possess cash
for the payment of requisitions. However this may
be, by the rule that requisitions must always be paid
for, it again becomes apparent and beyond all doubt
that henceforth private enemy property is as a rule
exempt from appropriation by an invading army.</p>

<p>A special kind of requisition is the quartering<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> of
soldiers in the houses of private inhabitants of enemy
territory, by which each inhabitant is required to supply
lodging and food for a certain number of soldiers,
and sometimes also stabling and forage for horses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Although the Hague Regulations do not specially
mention quartering, article 52 is nevertheless to be
applied to it, since quartering is nothing else than a
special kind of requisition. If cash cannot be paid at
once for quartering, every inhabitant concerned must
get a receipt for it, stating the number of soldiers
quartered and the number of days they were catered
for, and the payment of the amount must be made as
soon as possible.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_288_288" id="Footnote_288_288"></a><a href="#FNanchor_288_288"><span class="label">[288]</span></a> See
above, § <a href="#Private_personal_property143">143</a>.</p></div>

<p>But it must be specially observed, that neither in the
case of ordinary requisitions nor in the case of quartering
of troops is a commander compelled to pay the
prices asked by the inhabitants concerned. On the
contrary, he may fix the prices himself, although it is
expected that the prices paid shall be fair.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Contributions.</p></div>

<p>§ 148. <a name="Contribution_is_a_payment148" id="Contribution_is_a_payment148"></a>Contribution is a payment in ready money
demanded either from municipalities or from inhabitants,
whether enemy subjects or foreign residents.
Whereas formerly no general rules concerning contributions
existed, articles 49 and 51 of the Hague
Regulations now enact that contributions may not be
demanded extortionately, but exclusively<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> for the needs
of the army, in order, for instance, to pay for requisitions
or for the administration of the locality in question.
They may be imposed by a written order of a commander-in-chief
only, in contradistinction to requisitions which
may be imposed by a mere commander in a locality.
They may not be imposed indiscriminately on the inhabitants,
but must so far as possible be assessed upon
such inhabitants in compliance with the rules in force
of the respective enemy Government regarding the
assessment of taxes. And, finally, for every individual
contribution a receipt must be given. It is apparent
that these rules of the Hague Regulations try to exclude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
all arbitrariness and despotism on the part of an
invading enemy with regard to contributions, and that
they try to secure to the individual contributors as well
as to contributing municipalities the possibility of being

<p>§ 149. In former times invading armies frequently
used to fire and destroy all enemy property they could
not make use of or carry away. Afterwards, when
the practice of warfare grew milder, belligerents in
strict law retained the right to destroy enemy property
according to discretion, although they did not,
as a rule, any longer make use of such right. Nowadays,
however, this right is obsolete. For in the nineteenth
century it became a universally recognised rule of
International Law that all useless and wanton destruction
of enemy property, be it public or private, is
absolutely prohibited. And this rule has now been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
expressly enacted by article 23 (<i>g</i>) of the Hague
Regulations, where it is categorically enacted that
"to destroy ... enemy's property, unless such destruction ... be
imperatively demanded by the
necessities of war, is prohibited."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Destruction

<p>§ 150. All destruction of and damage to enemy
property for the purpose of offence and defence is
<i>necessary</i> destruction and damage, and therefore lawful.
It is not only permissible to destroy and damage all
kinds of enemy property on the battlefield during
battle, but also in preparation for battle or siege. To
strengthen a defensive position a house may be destroyed
or damaged. To cover the retreat of an army a village
on the battlefield may be fired. The district around an
enemy fortress held by a belligerent may be razed,
and, therefore, all private and public buildings, all
vegetation may be destroyed, and all bridges blown up
within a certain area. If a farm, a village, or even a
town is not to be abandoned but prepared for defence,
it may be necessary to damage in many ways or entirely
destroy private and public property. Further, if and
where a bombardment is lawful, all destruction of
property involved in it becomes likewise lawful. When
a belligerent force obtains possession of an enemy factory
for ammunition or provisions for the enemy troops, if it
is not certain that they can hold it against an attack,
they may at least destroy the plant, if not the buildings.
Or if a force occupies an enemy fortress, they may raze
the fortifications. Even a force intrenching themselves
on a battlefield may be obliged to resort to the destruction
of many kinds of property.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Destruction

<p>§ 151. Destruction of enemy property in marching
troops, conducting military transport, and in reconnoitring,
is likewise lawful if unavoidable. A reconnoitring
party need not keep on the road if they can
better serve their purpose by riding across the tilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
fields. And troops may be marched and transport
may be conducted over crops when necessary. A
humane commander will not unnecessarily allow his
troops and transport to march and ride over tilled
fields and crops. But if the purpose of war necessitates
it he is justified in so doing.</p>

<p>§ 152. Whatever enemy property a belligerent may
appropriate he may likewise destroy. To prevent
the enemy from making use of them a retreating force
may destroy arms, ammunition, provisions, and the
like, which they have taken from the enemy or requisitioned
and cannot carry away. But it must be
specially observed that they may not destroy provisions
in the possession of private enemy inhabitants
in order to prevent the enemy from making use of
them in the future.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

specially prohibited by article 56 of the Hague Regulations
which enacts that the perpetrators of such
acts must be prosecuted (<i>poursuivie</i>), that is court-martialed.
But it must be emphasised that these
objects enjoy this protection only during military
occupation of enemy territory. Should a battle be
waged around an historical monument on open ground,
should a church, a school, or a museum be defended and
attacked during military operations, these otherwise protected
objects may be damaged or destroyed under the
same conditions as other enemy property.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>General
Devastation.</p></div>

<p>§ 154. <a name="The_question_must154" id="The_question_must154"></a>The question must also be taken into consideration
whether and under what conditions general
devastation of a locality, be it a town or a larger part
of enemy territory, is permitted. There cannot be
the slightest doubt that such devastation is as a rule
absolutely prohibited and only in exceptional cases
permitted when, to use the words of article 23 (<i>g</i>) of
the Hague Regulations, it is "imperatively demanded
by the necessities of war." It is, however, impossible
to define once for all the circumstances which make a
general devastation necessary, since everything depends
upon the merits of the special case. But the fact that
a general devastation can be lawful must be admitted.
And it is, for instance, lawful in case of a levy <i>en masse</i>
on already occupied territory, when self-preservation
obliges a belligerent to resort to the most severe
measures. It is also lawful when, after the defeat of
his main forces and occupation of his territory, an
enemy disperses his remaining forces into small bands
which carry on guerilla tactics and receive food and
information, so that there is no hope of ending the war
except by a general devastation which cuts off supplies
of every kind from the guerilla bands. But it must be
specially observed that general devastation is only justified
by imperative necessity and by the fact that there is
no better and less severe way open to a belligerent.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

doctrine and practice of general devastation from Grotius down to the
beginning of the nineteenth century. See also Spaight, pp. 125-139.</p></div>

<p>Be that as it may, whenever a belligerent resorts
to general devastation he ought, if possible, to make
some provision for the unfortunate peaceful population
of the devastated tract of territory. It would be more
humane to take them away into captivity rather than
let them perish on the spot. The practice, resorted to
during the South African war, to house the victims of
devastation in concentration camps, must be approved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>

confine a population forcibly<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> in concentration camps.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Assault,
Siege, and
Bombardment,
when
lawful.</p></div>

<p>§ 155. Assault is the rush of an armed force upon
enemy forces in the battlefield, or upon intrenchments,
fortifications, habitations, villages, or towns, such
rushing force committing every violence against opposing
persons and destroying all impediments. Siege
is the surrounding and investing of an enemy locality
by an armed force, cutting off those inside from all
communication for the purpose of starving them into
surrender or for the purpose of attacking the invested
locality and taking it by assault. Bombardment is
the throwing by artillery of shot and shell upon persons
and things. Siege can be accompanied by bombardment
and assault, but this is not necessary, since a
siege can be carried out by mere investment and
starvation caused thereby. Assault, siege, and bombardment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
are severally and jointly perfectly legitimate
means of warfare.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Neither bombardment nor assault,
if they take place on the battlefield, needs special discussion,
as they are allowed under the same circumstances
and conditions as force in general is allowed.
The only question here is under what circumstances
assault and bombardment are allowed outside the
battlefield. The answer is indirectly given by article
25 of the Hague Regulations, where it is categorically
enacted that "the attack or bombardment, by any
means<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> whatever, of towns, villages, habitations, or
buildings, which are not defended, is prohibited."
Siege is not specially mentioned, because no belligerent
would dream of besieging an undefended locality, and
because siege of an undefended town would involve unjustifiable
violence against enemy persons and would,
therefore, be unlawful. Be this as it may, the fact
that defended localities only may now be bombarded,
involves a decided advance in the view taken by International
Law. For it was formerly asserted by many
writers<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and military experts that, for certain reasons
and purposes, undefended localities also might in exceptional
cases be bombarded. But it must be specially
observed that it matters not whether the defended
locality be fortified or not, since an unfortified place
can be defended.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> And it must be mentioned that
nothing prevents a belligerent who has taken possession
of an undefended fortified place from destroying the
fortifications by bombardment as well as by other
means.</p>

to starve the besieged into surrender

<div class="sidenote"><p>Assault,

<p>§ 156. No special rules of International Law exist
with regard to the mode of carrying out an assault.
Therefore, only the general rules respecting offence
and defence find application. It is in especial not<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
necessary to give notice of an impending assault to the
authorities of the respective locality, or to request them
to surrender before an assault is made. That an
assault may or may not be preceded or accompanied
by a bombardment, need hardly be mentioned,
nor that by article 28 of the Hague Regulations
pillage of towns taken by assault is now expressly
prohibited.</p>

<p>§ 157. <a name="Wi157" id="Wi157"></a>With regard to the mode of carrying out
siege without bombardment no special rules of International
Law exist, and here too only the general rules
respecting offence and defence find application. Therefore,
an armed force besieging a town may, for instance,
cut off the river which supplies drinking water to the
besieged, but must not poison<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> such river. And it must
be specially observed that no rule of law exists which
obliges a besieging force to allow all non-combatants,
or only women, children, the aged, the sick and wounded,
or subjects of neutral Powers, to leave the besieged
locality unmolested. Although such permission<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> is
sometimes granted, it is in most cases refused, because
the fact that non-combatants are besieged together
with the combatants, and that they have to endure
the same hardships, may, and very often does, exercise
pressure upon the authorities to surrender. Further,
should the commander of a besieged place expel the
non-combatants in order to lessen the number of those
who consume his store of provisions, the besieging force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
need not allow them to pass through its lines, but may
drive them back.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

War, the German besiegers

allowed the women, the children,

<p>That diplomatic envoys of neutral Powers may not
be prevented from leaving a besieged town is a consequence
of their exterritoriality. However, if they
voluntarily remain, may they claim uncontrolled<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
communication with their home State by correspondence
and couriers? When Mr. Washburne, the
American diplomatic envoy at Paris during the siege
of that city in 1870 by the Germans, claimed the right
of sending a messenger with despatches to London in a
sealed bag through the German lines, Bismarck declared
that he was ready to allow foreign diplomatists
in Paris to send a courier to their home States once
a week, but only under the condition that their despatches
were open and did not contain any remarks
concerning the war. Although the United States and
other Powers protested, Bismarck did not alter his
decision. The whole question must be treated as open.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>§ 158. Regarding bombardment, article 26 of the
Hague Regulations enacts that the commander of the
attacking forces shall do all he can to notify his intention
to resort to bombardment. But it must be emphasised
that a strict duty of notification for all cases
of bombardment is not thereby imposed, since it is
only enacted that a commander <i>shall do all he can</i> to
send notification. He cannot do it when the circumstances
of the case prevent him, or when the necessities
of war demand an immediate bombardment. Be that
as it may, the purpose of notification is to enable private
individuals within the locality to be bombarded to seek
shelter for their persons and for their valuable personal
property.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Article 27 of the Hague Regulations enacts the
hitherto customary rule that all necessary steps must
be taken to spare as far as possible all buildings devoted
to religion, art, science, and charity; further, historic
monuments, hospitals, and all other places where the
sick and wounded are collected, provided these buildings,
places, and monuments are not used at the same
time for military purposes. To enable the attacking
forces to spare these buildings and places, the latter
must be indicated by some particular signs, which must
be previously notified to the attacking forces and must
be visible from the far distance from which the besieging
artillery carries out the bombardment.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_305_305" id="Footnote_305_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_305_305"><span class="label">[305]</span></a> No siege takes place without the
besieged accusing the besiegers of
neglecting the rule that buildings
devoted to religion, art, charity, the
tending of the sick, and the like,
must be spared during bombardments.
The fact is that in case of
a bombardment the destruction of
such buildings cannot always be
avoided, although the artillery of the
besiegers do not intentionally aim at
them. That the forces of civilised
States intentionally destroy such
buildings, I cannot believe.</p></div>

<p>It must be specially observed that no legal duty
exists for the attacking forces to restrict bombardment
to fortifications only. On the contrary, destruction
of private and public buildings through
bombardment has always been and is still considered
lawful, as it is one of the means to impress upon the
authorities the advisability of surrender. Some writers<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
assert either that bombardment of the town, in contradistinction
to the fortifications, is never lawful, or that
it is only lawful when bombardment of the fortifications
has not resulted in inducing surrender. But this
opinion does not represent the actual practice of belligerents,
and the Hague Regulations do not adopt it.</p>

and
Treason.</p></div>

<p>§ 159. <a name="War_cannot_be159" id="War_cannot_be159"></a>War cannot be waged without all kinds of
information about the forces and the intentions of
the enemy and about the character of the country
within the zone of military operations. To obtain
the necessary information, it has always been considered
lawful, on the one hand, to employ spies, and,
on the other, to make use of the treason of enemy
soldiers or private enemy subjects, whether they were
bribed<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> or offered the information voluntarily and
gratuitously. Article 24 of the Hague Regulations
enacts the old customary rule that the employment
of methods necessary to obtain information about the
enemy and the country is considered allowable. The
fact, however, that these methods are lawful on the
part of the belligerent who employs them does not
prevent the punishment of such individuals as are
engaged in procuring information. Although a belligerent
acts lawfully in employing spies and traitors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the other belligerent, who punishes spies and traitors,
likewise acts lawfully. Indeed, espionage and treason
bear a twofold character. For persons committing
acts of espionage or treason are&mdash;as will be shown
below in § <a href="#Article_24_of_the_Hague255">255</a>&mdash;considered war criminals and may be
punished, but the employment of spies and traitors is
considered lawful on the part of the belligerents.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_307_307" id="Footnote_307_307"></a><a href="#FNanchor_307_307"><span class="label">[307]</span></a> Some writers maintain, however,
that it is not lawful to bribe enemy
soldiers into espionage; see below,
§ <a href="#Treason_can_be162">162</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Espionage
in contradistinction
to
Scouting
and
Despatch-bearing.</p></div>

<p>§ 160. Espionage must not be confounded, firstly,
with scouting, or secondly, with despatch-bearing.
According to article 29 of the Hague Regulations,
espionage is the act of a soldier or other individual
who clandestinely, or under false pretences, seeks to
obtain information concerning one belligerent in the
zone of belligerent operations with the intention of
communicating it to the other belligerent.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> Therefore,
soldiers not in disguise, who penetrate into the zone
of operations of the enemy, are not spies. They are
scouts who enjoy all privileges of the members of
armed forces, and they must, if captured, be treated as
prisoners of war. Likewise, soldiers or civilians charged
with the delivery of despatches for their own army or
for that of the enemy and carrying out their mission
openly are not spies. And it matters not whether
despatch-bearers make use of balloons or of other
means of communication. Thus, a soldier or civilian
trying to carry despatches from a force besieged in a
fortress to other forces of the same belligerent, whether
making use of a balloon or riding or walking at night,
may not be treated as a spy. On the other hand,
spying can well be carried out by despatch-bearers or
by persons in a balloon, whether they make use of the
balloon of a despatch-bearer or rise in a balloon for
the special purpose of spying.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> The mere fact that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
balloon is visible does not protect the persons using it
from being treated as spies; since spying can be
carried out under false pretences quite as well as
clandestinely. But special care must be taken really
to prove the fact of espionage in such cases, for an
individual carrying despatches is <i>prima facie</i> not a
spy and must not be treated as a spy until proved to
be such.</p>

or knowingly concealing a spy are,
according to a customary rule of
International Law, punishable as
though they were themselves acts of

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_309_309" id="Footnote_309_309"></a><a href="#FNanchor_309_309"><span class="label">[309]</span></a> See
below, § <a href="#Information_regarding356">356</a> (4), concerning
wireless telegraphy.</p></div>

<p>A remarkable case of espionage is that of Major
André,<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> which occurred in 1780 during the American
War of Independence. The American General Arnold,
who was commandant of West Point, on the North
River, intended to desert the Americans and join the
British forces. He opened negotiations with Sir Henry
Clinton for the purpose of surrendering West Point,
and Major André was commissioned by Sir Henry
Clinton to make the final arrangements with Arnold.
On the night of September 21, Arnold and André met
outside the American and British lines, but André,
after having changed his uniform for plain clothes,
undertook to pass the American lines on his return,
furnished with a passport under the name of John
Anderson by General Arnold. He was caught, convicted
as a spy, and hanged. As he was not seeking
information,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and therefore was not a spy according to
article 29 of the Hague Regulations, a conviction for
espionage would not, if such a case occurred to-day, be
justified. But it would be possible to convict for war
treason, for André was no doubt negotiating treason.
Be that as it may, George III. considered André a
martyr, and honoured his memory by granting a pension
to his mother and a baronetcy to his brother.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Punishment
of
Espionage.</p></div>

<p>§ 161. The usual punishment for spying is hanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
or shooting, but less severe punishments are, of course,
admissible and sometimes inflicted. However this may
be, according to article 30 of the Hague Regulations a
spy may not be punished without a trial before a court-martial.
And according to article 31 of the Hague
Regulations a spy who is not captured in the act but
rejoins the army to which he belongs, and is subsequently
captured by the enemy, may not be punished
for his previous espionage and must be treated as a
prisoner of war. But it must be specially observed
that article 31 concerns only such spies as belong to the
armed forces of the enemy; civilians who act as spies
and are captured later may be punished. Be that as it
may, no regard is paid to the status, rank, position, or
motive of a spy. He may be a soldier or a civilian, an
officer or a private. He may be following instructions
of superiors or acting on his own initiative from patriotic
motives. A case of espionage, remarkable on account
of the position of the spy, is that of the American
Captain Nathan Hale, which occurred in 1776. After
the American forces had withdrawn from Long Island,
Captain Hale recrossed under disguise and obtained
valuable information about the English forces that had
occupied the island. But he was caught before he
could rejoin his army, and he was executed as a spy.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_313_313" id="Footnote_313_313"></a><a href="#FNanchor_313_313"><span class="label">[313]</span></a> The case of Major Jakoga and
Captain Oki, which, though reported
as a case of espionage, is really a
case of treason, will be discussed
below in § <a href="#Article_24_of_the_Hague255">255</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Treason.</p></div>

<p>§ 162. <a name="Treason_can_be162" id="Treason_can_be162"></a>Treason can be committed by a soldier or an
ordinary subject of a belligerent, but it can also be
committed by an inhabitant of an occupied enemy
territory or even by the subject of a neutral State
temporarily staying there, and it can take place after
an arrangement with the favoured belligerent or
without such an arrangement. In any case a belligerent
making use of treason acts lawfully, although
the Hague Regulations do not mention the matter at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
all. But many acts of different sorts can be treasonable;
the possible cases of treason and the punishment
of treason will be discussed below in § <a href="#Article_24_of_the_Hague255">255</a>.</p>

<p>Although it is generally recognised that a belligerent
acts lawfully who makes use of the offer of a traitor, the
question is controversial<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> whether a belligerent acts
lawfully who bribes a commander of an enemy fortress
into surrender, incites enemy soldiers to desertion,
bribes enemy officers for the purpose of getting important
information, incites enemy subjects to rise
against the legitimate Government, and the like. If
the rules of the Law of Nations are formulated, not
from doctrines of book-writers, but from what is done
by the belligerents in practice,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> it must be asserted that
such acts, detestable and immoral as they are, are not
considered illegal according to the Law of Nations.</p>

during military operations for the purpose
of misleading the enemy. Such deceit is of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
importance in war, and, just as belligerents are allowed
to employ all methods of obtaining information, so
they are, on the other hand, and article 24 of the Hague
Regulations confirms this, allowed to employ all sorts
of ruses for the purpose of deceiving the enemy. Very
important objects can be attained through ruses of
war, as, for instance, the surrender of a force or of a
fortress, the evacuation of territory held by the enemy,
the withdrawal from a siege, the abandonment of an
intended attack, and the like. But ruses of war are
also employed, and are very often the decisive factor,
during battles.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Different
kinds of
Stratagems.</p></div>

<p>§ 164. <a name="Of_ruses_there164" id="Of_ruses_there164"></a>Of ruses there are so many kinds that it is
impossible to enumerate<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> and classify them. But in
order to illustrate acts carried out as ruses some instances
may be given. It is hardly necessary to
mention the laying of ambushes and traps, the masking
of military operations such as marches or the erection
of batteries and the like, the feigning of attacks or
flights or withdrawals, the carrying out of a surprise,
and other stratagems employed every day in war.
But it is important to know that, when useful, feigned
signals and bugle-calls may be ordered, the watchword
of the enemy may be used, deceitful intelligence may
be disseminated,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> the signals and the bugle-calls of
the enemy may be mimicked<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> to mislead his forces.
And even such detestable acts<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> as bribery of enemy
commanders and officials in high position, and secret
seduction of enemy soldiers to desertion, and of enemy
subjects to insurrection, are frequently committed,
although many writers protest. As regards the use
of the national flag, the military ensigns, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
uniforms of the enemy, theory and practice are unanimous
in rejecting it during actual attack and defence,
since the principle is considered inviolable that
during actual fighting belligerent forces ought to be
certain who is friend and who is foe. But many<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
publicists maintain that until the actual fighting begins
belligerent forces may by way of stratagem make use of
the national flag, military ensigns, and uniforms of
the enemy. Article 23 (<i>f</i>) of the Hague Regulations
does not prohibit any and every use of these symbols,
but only their <i>improper</i> use, thus leaving the question
open,<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> what uses are proper and what are not. Those
who have hitherto taught the admissibility of the use
of these symbols outside actual fighting can correctly
maintain that the quoted article 23 (<i>f</i>) does not prohibit
it.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

is daily becoming larger; see, for instance, Lueder in Holtzendorff, IV.

for the purpose of deceit is different
from the case when members of
armed forces who are deficient in
clothes wear the uniforms of prisoners
or of the enemy dead. If this is
done&mdash;and it always will be done if
necessary&mdash;such distinct alterations
in the uniform ought to be made as
will make it apparent to which side
the soldiers concerned belong (see
<i>Land Warfare</i>, § 154). Different again
is the case where soldiers are, through
lack of clothing, obliged to wear the
apparel of civilians, such as greatcoats,
hats, and the like. Care must
then be taken that the soldiers concerned
do nevertheless wear a fixed
distinctive emblem which marks
them as soldiers, since otherwise
they lose the privileges of members
of the armed forces of the belligerents
(see article 1, No. 2, of the Hague
Regulations). During the Russo-Japanese
War both belligerents repeatedly
accused each other of using
Chinese clothing for members of
their armed forces; the soldiers
concerned apparently were obliged
through lack of proper clothing
temporarily to make use of Chinese
garments. See, however, Takahashi,

the latter is prohibited. Halleck (I. p. 566) correctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
formulates the distinction by laying down the principle
that, whenever a belligerent has expressly or tacitly
engaged and is therefore bound by a moral obligation
to speak the truth to an enemy, it is perfidy to betray
the latter's confidence, because it contains a breach of
good faith.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Thus a flag of truce or the cross of the
Geneva Convention must never be made use of for a
stratagem, capitulations must be carried out to the
letter, the feigning of surrender for the purpose of
luring the enemy into a trap is a treacherous act, as is
the assassination of enemy commanders or soldiers or
heads of States. On the other hand, stratagem may
be met by stratagem, and a belligerent cannot complain
of the enemy who so deceives him. If, for instance,
a spy of the enemy is bribed to give deceitful
intelligence to his employer, or if an officer, who is
approached by the enemy and offered a bribe, accepts
it feigningly but deceives the briber and leads him to
disaster, no perfidy is committed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Occupation
as an
Aim of
Warfare.</p></div>

<p>§ 166. If a belligerent succeeds in occupying a
part or even the whole of the enemy territory, he has
realised a very important aim of warfare. He can
now not only make use of the resources of the enemy
country for military purposes, but can also keep it for
the time being as a pledge of his military success, and
thereby impress upon the enemy the necessity of submitting
to terms of peace. And in regard to occupation,
International Law respecting warfare has progressed
more than in any other department. In former times
enemy territory that was occupied by a belligerent
was in every point considered his State property, with
which and with the inhabitants therein he could do
what he liked. He could devastate the country with fire
and sword, appropriate all public and private property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
therein, kill the inhabitants, or take them away into
captivity, or make them take an oath of allegiance.
He could, even before the war was decided and his
occupation was definitive, dispose of the territory by
ceding it to a third State, and an instance of this
happened during the Northern War (1700-1718), when
in 1715 Denmark sold the occupied Swedish territories
of Bremen and Verden to Hanover. That an occupant
could force the inhabitants of the occupied territory
to serve in his own army and to fight against their
legitimate sovereign, was indubitable. Thus, during
the Seven Years' War, Frederick II. of Prussia repeatedly
made forcible levies of thousands of recruits
in Saxony, which he had occupied. But during the
second half of the eighteenth century things gradually
began to undergo a change. That the distinction between
mere temporary military occupation of territory,
on the one hand, and, on the other, real acquisition of
territory through conquest and subjugation, became
more and more apparent, is shown by the fact that
Vattel (III. § 197) drew attention to it. However, it was
not till long after the Napoleonic wars in the nineteenth
century that the consequences of this distinction were
carried to their full extent by the theory and practice
of International Law. So late as 1808, after the
Russian troops had militarily occupied Finland, which
was at that time a part of Sweden, Alexander I. of
Russia made the inhabitants take an oath of allegiance,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
although it was only by article 4 of the Peace Treaty of
Frederikshamm<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> of September 17, 1809, that Sweden
ceded Finland to Russia. The first writer who drew
all the consequences of the distinction between mere
military occupation and real acquisition of territory was
Heffter in his treatise <i>Das Europaeische Völkerrecht der
Gegenwart</i> (§ 131), which made its appearance in 1844.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
And it is certain that it took the whole of the nineteenth
century to develop such rules regarding occupation as
are now universally recognised and in many respects
enacted by articles 42-56 of the Hague Regulations.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_324_324" id="Footnote_324_324"></a><a href="#FNanchor_324_324"><span class="label">[324]</span></a> See Martens, <i>N.R.</i> I. p. 9.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_325_325" id="Footnote_325_325"></a><a href="#FNanchor_325_325"><span class="label">[325]</span></a> See Martens, <i>N.R.</i> I. p. 19.</p></div>

<p>In so far as these rules touch upon the special
treatment of persons and property of the inhabitants
of, and public property situated within, occupied
territory, they have already been taken into consideration
above in §§ <a href="#As_war_is_a_contention107">107</a>-154. What concerns us here are
the rights and duties of the occupying belligerent in
relation to his political administration of the territory
and to his political authority over its inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
The principle underlying these modern rules is that,
although the occupant does in no wise acquire sovereignty
over such territory through the mere fact
of having occupied it, he actually exercises for the
time being a military authority over it. As he thereby
prevents the legitimate Sovereign from exercising his
authority and claims obedience for himself from the
inhabitants, he has to administer the country not only
in the interest of his own military advantage, but also,
so far as possible at any rate, for the public benefit of
the inhabitants. Thus the present International Law
not only gives certain rights to an occupant, but also
imposes certain duties upon him.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_326_326" id="Footnote_326_326"></a><a href="#FNanchor_326_326"><span class="label">[326]</span></a> The Hague Regulations (Section III. articles 42-56), and
all the French writers, but also many others, treat under the heading
"occupation" not only of the rights and duties of an occupant concerning
the political administration of the country and the political authority
over the inhabitants, but also of other matters, such as appropriation
of public and private property, requisitions and contributions, and
destruction of public and private property, violence against private
enemy subjects and enemy officials. These matters have, however, nothing
to do with occupation, but are better discussed in connection with the
means of land warfare; see above, §§ <a href="#As_war_is_a_contention107">107</a>-154.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Occupation,
when
effected.</p></div>

<p>§ 167. <a name="Since_an_occupant167" id="Since_an_occupant167"></a>Since an occupant, although his power is
merely military, has certain rights and duties, the
first question to deal with is, when and under what
circumstances a territory must be considered occupied.</p>

<p>Now it is certain that mere invasion is not occupation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Invasion is the marching or riding of troops&mdash;or
the flying of a military air vessel&mdash;into enemy country.
Occupation is invasion <i>plus</i> taking possession of enemy
country for the purpose of holding it, at any rate temporarily.
The difference between mere invasion and
occupation becomes apparent by the fact that an
occupant sets up some kind of administration, whereas
the mere invader does not. A small belligerent force
can raid enemy territory without establishing any
administration, but quickly rush on to some place in
the interior for the purpose of reconnoitring, of destroying
a bridge or depôt of munitions and provisions, and
the like, and quickly withdraw after having realised its
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Although it may correctly be asserted that,
so long and in so far as such raiding force is in possession
of a locality and sets up a temporary administration
therein, it occupies this locality, yet it certainly does
not occupy the whole territory, and even the occupation
of such locality ceases the moment the force
withdraws.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_327_327" id="Footnote_327_327"></a><a href="#FNanchor_327_327"><span class="label">[327]</span></a> See <i>Land Warfare</i>, § 343.</p></div>

<p>However this may be, as a rule occupation will be
coincident with invasion. The troops march into a
district, and the moment they get into a village or
town&mdash;unless they are actually fighting their way&mdash;they
take possession of the Municipal Offices, the
Post Office, the Police Stations, and the like, and
assert their authority there. From the military point
of view such villages and towns are now "occupied."
Article 42 of the Hague Regulations enacts that
territory is considered occupied when it is actually
placed under the authority of the hostile army, and
that such occupation applies only to the territory where
that authority is established and in a position to assert
itself. This definition of occupation is not at all precise,
but it is as precise as a legal definition of such kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
fact as occupation can be. If, as some publicists<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
maintain, only such territory were actually occupied,
in which every part is held by a sufficient number of
soldiers to enforce immediately and on the very spot
the authority of an occupant, an effective occupation
of a large territory would be impossible, since then not
only in every town, village, and railway station, but
also in every isolated habitation and hut the presence
of a sufficient number of soldiers would be necessary.
Reasonably no other conditions ought to be laid down
as necessary to constitute effective occupation in war
than those under which in time of peace a Sovereign
is able to assert his authority over a territory. What
these conditions are is a question of fact which is to be
answered according to the merits of the special case.
When the legitimate Sovereign is prevented from
exercising his powers and the occupant, being able to
assert his authority, actually establishes an administration
over a territory, it matters not with what
means and in what ways his authority is exercised.
For instance, when in the centre of a territory a large
force is established from which flying columns are
constantly sent round the territory, such territory is
indeed effectively occupied, provided there are no
enemy forces present, and, further, provided these
columns can really keep the territory concerned under
control.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Again, when an army is marching on through
enemy territory, taking possession of the lines of communication
and the open towns, surrounding the
fortresses with besieging forces, and disarming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
inhabitants in open places of habitation, the whole
territory left behind the army is effectively occupied,
provided some kind of administration is established,
and further provided that, as soon as it becomes
necessary to assert the authority of the occupant, a
sufficient force can within reasonable time be sent to
the locality affected. The conditions vary with those
of the country concerned. When a vast country is
thinly populated, a smaller force is necessary to occupy
it, and a smaller number of centres need be garrisoned
than in the case of a thickly populated country. Thus,
the occupation of the former Orange Free State and
the former South African Republic became effective
in 1901 some time after their annexation by Great
Britain and the degeneration of ordinary war into
guerilla war, although only about 250,000 British
soldiers had to keep up the occupation of a territory of
about 500,000 square miles. The fact that all the
towns and all the lines of communication were in the
hands and under the administration of the British
army, that the inhabitants of smaller places were taken
away into concentration camps, that the enemy forces
were either in captivity or dispersed into comparatively
small guerilla bands, and finally, that wherever such
bands tried to make an attack, a sufficient British
force could within reasonable time make its appearance,
was quite sufficient to assert British authority<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
that vast territory, although it was more than a year
before peace was finally established.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_328_328" id="Footnote_328_328"></a><a href="#FNanchor_328_328"><span class="label">[328]</span></a> See, for instance, Hall, § 161.
This was also the standpoint of the
delegates of the smaller States at the
Brussels Conference of 1874 when
the Declaration of Brussels was
drafted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_329_329" id="Footnote_329_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_329_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> This is not identical with so-called
<i>constructive</i> occupation, but
is really <i>effective</i> occupation. An
occupation is constructive only if an
invader declares districts as occupied
over which he actually does not
exercise control&mdash;for instance, when
he actually occupies only the capital
of a large province, and proclaims
that he has thereby occupied the
whole of the province, although he
does not take any steps to exercise
control over it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_330_330" id="Footnote_330_330"></a><a href="#FNanchor_330_330"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> The annexation of the Orange
Free State dates from May 24, 1900,
and that of the South African Republic
from September 1, 1900. It
may well be doubted whether at
these dates the occupation of the
territories concerned was already so
complete as to be called effective.
The British Government ought not,
therefore, to have proclaimed the
annexation at such early dates. But
there ought to be no doubt that the
occupation became effective some
time afterwards, in 1901. See, however,
Sir Thomas Barclay in <i>The Law
Quarterly Review</i>, XXI. (1905), p. 307,
who asserts the contrary; see also,
below, § <a href="#Footnote_499_499">264, p. 326, note 2</a>, and
 § <a href="#Footnote_500_500">265, p. 327, note 1</a>. <i>The Times' History
of the War in South Africa</i> (vol. V. p.
251) estimates the number of Boer
fighters in May 1901 to be about
13,000. These armed men were dispersed
into a very large number of
guerilla bands, and they were in a
great many cases men who seemingly
had submitted to the British authorities, but
afterwards had taken up arms.</p></div>

<p>It must be emphasised that the rules regarding
effective occupation must be formulated on the basis
of actual practice quite as much as rules regarding
other matters of International Law. Those rules are
not authoritative which are laid down by theorists,
but only those which are abstracted from the actual
practice of warfare and are unopposed by the Powers.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Occupation,
when
ended.</p></div>

<p>§ 168. Occupation comes to an end when an occupant
withdraws from a territory or is driven out of it.
Thus, occupation remains only over a limited area of a
territory if the forces in occupation are drawn into a
fortress on that territory and are there besieged by the
re-advancing enemy, or if the occupant concentrates his
forces in a certain place of the territory, withdrawing
before the re-advancing enemy. But occupation does
not cease because the occupant, after having disarmed
the inhabitants and having made arrangements for
the administration of the country, is marching on to
overtake the retreating enemy, leaving only comparatively
few soldiers behind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Rights
and
Duties in
General
of the
Occupant.</p></div>

<p>§ 169. As the occupant actually exercises authority,
and as the legitimate Government is prevented from
exercising its authority, the occupant acquires a
temporary right of administration over the respective
territory and its inhabitants. And all steps he takes
in the exercise of this right must be recognised by the
legitimate Government after occupation has ceased.
This administration is in no wise to be compared with
ordinary administration, for it is distinctly and precisely
military administration. In carrying it out the occupant
is, on the one hand, totally independent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
Constitution and the laws of the respective territory,
since occupation is an aim of warfare, and since the
maintenance and safety of his forces and the purpose
of war stand in the foreground of his interest and must
be promoted under all circumstances and conditions.
But, although as regards the safety of his army and
the purpose of war the occupant is vested with an
almost absolute power, he is not the Sovereign of the
territory, and therefore has no right to make changes
in the laws or in the administration except those
which are temporarily necessitated by his interest in
the maintenance and safety of his army and the realisation
of the purpose of war. On the contrary, he has
the duty of administrating the country according to
the existing laws and the existing rules of administration;
he must insure public order and safety, must
respect family honour and rights, individual lives,
private property, religious convictions and liberty.
Article 43 of the Hague Regulations enacts the following
rule which is of fundamental importance: "The
authority of the legitimate Power having actually
passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall
take all steps in his power to re-establish and insure, as
far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting,
unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the
country."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Rights

<p>§ 170. <a name="An_occupant_having170" id="An_occupant_having170"></a>An occupant having authority over the
territory, the inhabitants are under his sway and have
to render obedience to his commands. However, the
power of the occupant over the inhabitants is not
unrestricted, for articles 23, 44, and 45 of the Hague
Regulations expressly enact, that he is prohibited from
compelling the inhabitants to take part in military
operations against the legitimate Government, to give
information concerning the army of the other belligerent
or concerning the latter's means of defence, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to take an oath of allegiance. On the other hand, he
may compel them to take an oath&mdash;sometimes called an
"oath of neutrality"&mdash;to abstain from taking up a
hostile attitude against the occupant and willingly to
submit to his legitimate commands; and he may punish
them severely for breaking this oath. He may make
requisitions and demand contributions<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> from them, may

other works as are necessary for military operations.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
He may also collect the ordinary taxes, dues, and tolls
imposed for the benefit of the State by the legitimate
Government. But in such case he is, according to
article 48 of the Hague Regulations, obliged to make
the collection, as far as possible, in accordance with
the rules in existence and the assessment in force, and
he is, on the other hand, bound to defray the expenses
of the administration of the occupied territory on the
same scale as that by which the legitimate Government
was bound.</p>

on the part of belligerents occupying enemy
territory. In case acts of illegitimate warfare are
committed by enemy individuals not belonging to the
armed forces, reprisals may be resorted to, although
practically innocent individuals are thereby punished
for illegal acts for which they are neither legally nor
morally responsible&mdash;for instance, when a village is
burned by way of reprisal for a treacherous attack
committed there on enemy soldiers by some unknown
individuals.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Nor does this new rule prevent an
occupant from taking hostages<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> in the interest of the

other purposes,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> although the hostage must suffer for
acts or omissions of others for which he is neither

<p>§ 171. As through occupation authority over the
territory actually passes into the hands of the occupant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
he may for the time of his occupation depose all Government
officials and municipal functionaries that have
not withdrawn with the retreating enemy. On the
other hand, he must not compel them by force to carry
on their functions during occupation, if they refuse to
do so, except where a military necessity for the carrying
on of a certain function arises. If they are willing to
serve under him, he may make them take an oath of
obedience, but not of allegiance, and he may not compel
them to carry on their functions in his name, but he
may prevent them from doing so in the name of the
legitimate Government.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Since, according to article 43
of the Hague Regulations, he has to secure public order

officials of the legitimate Government in office, he "must" pay them
their ordinary salaries. But I cannot see that there is a customary or
conventional rule in existence concerning this point. But it is in an
occupant's own interest to pay such salaries. and he will as a rule do
this. Only in the case of article 48 of the Hague Regulations is he
compelled to do it.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Position of
Courts of
Justice
during Occupation.</p></div>

<p>§ 172. The particular position which Courts of
Justice have nowadays in civilised countries, makes it
necessary to discuss their position during occupation.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
There is no doubt that an occupant may suspend the
judges as well as other officials. However, if he does
suspend them, he must temporarily appoint others in
their place. If they are willing to serve under him, he
must respect their independence according to the laws
of the country. Where it is necessary, he may set up
military Courts instead of the ordinary Courts. In
case and in so far as he admits the administration of
justice by the ordinary Courts, he may nevertheless,
so far as it is necessary for military purposes or for the
maintenance of public order and safety, temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
alter the laws, especially the Criminal Law, on the basis
of which justice is administered, as well as the laws
regarding procedure. He has, however, no right to
constrain the Courts to pronounce their verdicts in his
name, although he need not allow them to pronounce
verdicts in the name of the legitimate Government. A
case that happened during the Franco-German War
may serve as an illustration. In September 1870,
after the fall of the Emperor Napoleon and the proclamation
of the French Republic, the Court of Appeal
at Nancy pronounced its verdicts under the formula
"In the name of the French Government and People."
Since Germany had not yet recognised the French
Republic, the Germans ordered the Court to use the
formula "In the name of the High German Powers
occupying Alsace and Lorraine," but gave the Court
to understand that, if the Court objected to this
formula, they were disposed to admit another, and
were even ready to admit the formula "In the name of
the Emperor of the French," as the Emperor had not
abdicated. The Court, however, refused to pronounce
its verdict otherwise than "In the name of the French
Government and People," and, consequently, suspended
its sittings. There can be no doubt that the
Germans had no right to order the formula, "In the
name of the High German Powers, &amp;c.," to be used,
but they were certainly not obliged to admit the
formula preferred by the Court; and the fact that they
were disposed to admit another formula than that at
first ordered ought to have made the Court accept a
compromise. Bluntschli (§ 547) correctly maintains
that the most natural solution of the difficulty would
have been to use the neutral formula "In the name of
the Law."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Aims and
Means of
Sea
Warfare.</p></div>

<p>§ 173. <a name="The_purpose_of_war173" id="The_purpose_of_war173"></a>The purpose of war is the same in the case of
warfare on land or on sea&mdash;namely, the overpowering
of the enemy. But sea warfare serves this purpose by
attempting the accomplishment of aims different from
those of land warfare. Whereas the aims of land warfare
are defeat of the enemy army and occupation of the
enemy territory, the aims<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> of sea warfare are: defeat of
the enemy navy; annihilation of the enemy merchant
fleet; destruction of enemy coast fortifications, and
of maritime as well as military establishments on the
enemy coast; cutting off intercourse with the enemy
coast; prevention of carriage of contraband and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
rendering unneutral service to the enemy; all kinds of
support to military operations on land, such as protection
of a landing of troops on the enemy coast; and
lastly, defence of the home coast and protection to the
home merchant fleet.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> The means by which belligerents
in sea warfare endeavour to realise these aims
are: attack on and seizure of enemy vessels, violence
against enemy individuals, appropriation and destruction
of enemy vessels and goods carried by them,
requisitions and contributions, bombardment of the
enemy coast, cutting of submarine cables, blockade,
espionage, treason, ruses, capture of neutral vessels
carrying contraband or rendering unneutral service.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_342_342" id="Footnote_342_342"></a><a href="#FNanchor_342_342"><span class="label">[342]</span></a> Aims of sea warfare must not be confounded with ends of war;
see above, § <a href="#The_cause_or_causes66">66</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_343_343" id="Footnote_343_343"></a><a href="#FNanchor_343_343"><span class="label">[343]</span></a> Article 1 of the U.S. Naval War Code enumerates the
following as aims of sea warfare:&mdash;The capture or destruction of the
military and naval forces of the enemy, of his fortifications, arsenals,
dry docks, and dockyards, of his various military and naval
establishments, and of his maritime commerce; to prevent his procuring
war material from neutral sources; to aid and assist military operations
on land; to protect and defend the national territory, property, and
sea-borne commerce.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Lawful
and
Unlawful
Practices
of Sea
Warfare.</p></div>

<p>§ 174. <a name="As_regards_means174" id="As_regards_means174"></a>As regards means of sea warfare, just as
regards means of land warfare, it must be emphasised
that not every practice capable of injuring the enemy
in offence and defence is lawful. Although no regulations
regarding the laws of war on sea have as
yet been enacted by a general law-making treaty as a
pendant to the Hague Regulations, there are treaties
concerning special points&mdash;such as submarine mines,
bombardment by naval forces, and others&mdash;and customary
rules of International Law in existence which
regulate the matter. Be that as it may, the rules
concerning sea warfare are in many points identical
with, but in many respects differ from, the rules in
force regarding warfare on land. Therefore, the means
of sea warfare must be discussed separately in the
following sections. But blockade and capture of
vessels carrying contraband and rendering unneutral
service to the enemy, although they are means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
warfare against an enemy, are of such importance as
regards neutral trade that they will be discussed below
in Part III. §§ <a href="#Blockade_is_the_blocking368">368</a>-413.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Objects of
the Means
of Sea
Warfare.</p></div>

<p>§ 175. Whereas the objects against which means
of land warfare may be directed are innumerable, the
number of the objects against which means of sea
warfare are directed is very limited, comprising six
objects only. The chief object is enemy vessels,
whether public or private; the next, enemy individuals,
with distinction between those taking part in fighting
and others; the third, enemy goods on enemy vessels;
the fourth, the enemy coast; the fifth and sixth, neutral
vessels attempting to break blockade, carrying contraband,
or rendering unneutral service to the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Development
of
International
Law
regarding
Private
Property
on Sea.</p></div>

<p>§ 176. <a name="It_is_evident176" id="It_is_evident176"></a>It is evident that in times when a belligerent
could destroy all public and private enemy property he
was able to seize, no special rule existed regarding
private enemy ships and private enemy property
carried by them on the sea. But the practice of sea
warfare frequently went beyond the limits of even so
wide a right, treating neutral goods on enemy ships as
enemy goods, and treating neutral ships carrying enemy
goods as enemy ships. It was not until the time of the
<i>Consolato del Mare</i> in the fourteenth century that a
set of clear and definite rules with regard to private
enemy vessels and private enemy property on sea in
contradistinction to neutral ships and neutral goods
was adopted. According to this famous collection of
maritime usages observed by the communities of the
Mediterranean, there is no doubt that a belligerent
may seize and appropriate all private enemy ships and
goods. But a distinction is made in case of either ship
or goods being neutral. Although an enemy ship may
always be appropriated, neutral goods thereon have to
be restored to the neutral owners. On the other hand,
enemy goods on neutral ships may be appropriated, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the neutral ships carrying such goods must be restored
to their owners. However, these rules of the <i>Consolato
del Mare</i> were not at all generally recognised, although
they were adopted by several treaties between single
States during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
Neither the communities belonging to the Hanseatic
League, nor the Netherlands and Spain during the War
of Independence, nor England and Spain during their
wars in the sixteenth century, adopted these rules.
And France expressly enacted by Ordinances of 1543
(article 42) and 1583 (article 69) that neutral goods on
enemy ships as well as neutral ships carrying enemy
goods should be appropriated.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Although France
adopted in 1650 the rules of the <i>Consolato del Mare</i>,
Louis XIV. dropped them again by the Ordinance of
1681 and re-enacted that neutral goods on enemy ships
and neutral ships carrying enemy goods should be
appropriated. Spain enacted the same rules in 1718.
The Netherlands, in contradistinction to the <i>Consolato
del Mare</i>, endeavoured by a number of treaties to foster
the principle that the flag covers the goods, so that
enemy goods on neutral vessels were exempt from,
whereas neutral goods on enemy vessels were subject
to, appropriation. On the other hand, throughout the
eighteenth and during the nineteenth century down to
the beginning of the Crimean War in 1854, England
adhered to the rules of the <i>Consolato del Mare</i>. Thus,
no generally accepted rules of International Law
regarding private property on sea were in existence.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
Matters were made worse by privateering, which was
generally recognised as lawful, and by the fact that
belligerents frequently declared a coast blockaded
without having a sufficient number of men-of-war on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the spot to make the blockade effective. It was not
until the Declaration of Paris in 1856 that general rules
of International Law regarding private property on
sea came into existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Declaration
of
Paris.</p></div>

<p>§ 177. <a name="Things_began_to177" id="Things_began_to177"></a>Things began to undergo a change with the
outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, when all the
belligerents proclaimed that they would not issue
Letters of Marque, and when, further, Great Britain
declared that she would not seize enemy goods on
neutral vessels, and when, thirdly, France declared
that she would not appropriate neutral goods on enemy
vessels. Although this alteration of attitude on the
part of the belligerents was originally intended for the
Crimean War only and exceptionally, it led after the
conclusion of peace in 1856 to the famous and epoch-making
Declaration of Paris,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> which enacted the four
rules&mdash;(1) that privateering is abolished, (2) that the
neutral flag covers enemy goods<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> with the exception
of contraband of war, (3) that neutral goods, contraband
of war excepted, are not liable to capture under the
enemy flag, (4) that blockades, in order to be binding,
must be effective, which means maintained by a force
sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the
enemy. Since, with the exception of a few States such
as the United States of America, Colombia, Venezuela,
Bolivia, and Uruguay, all members of the Family
of Nations are now parties to the Declaration of
Paris, it may well be maintained that the rules
quoted are general International Law, the more
so as the non-signatory Powers have hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in practice always acted in accordance with those
rules.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

429&mdash;that the neutral flag covers only private, not public, enemy
property, and therefore that such goods on neutral vessels as belong to
the State of the enemy may be seized and appropriated. This opinion
would seem, however, to be untenable in face of the fact that the
Declaration of Paris speaks of <i>marchandise neutre</i> without any
qualification, only excepting contraband goods, thus protecting the
whole of the cargo under the neutral flag, contraband excepted. See
below, § <a href="#Footnote_599_599">319, p. 385, note 3</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Principle of Appropriation of Private Enemy Vessels and
Enemy Goods thereon.</p></div>

<p>§ 178. <a name="The_Declaration_of_Paris178" id="The_Declaration_of_Paris178"></a>The Declaration of Paris did not touch upon
the old rule that private enemy vessels and private
enemy goods thereon may be seized and appropriated,
and this rule is, therefore, as valid as ever, although
there is much agitation for its abolition. In 1785
Prussia and the United States of America had already
stipulated by article 23 of their Treaty of Friendship<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>
that in case of war between the parties each other's
merchantmen shall not be seized and appropriated.
Again, in 1871 the United States and Italy, by article
12 of their Treaty of Commerce,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> stipulated that in
case of war between the parties each other's merchantmen,
with the exception of those carrying contraband
of war or attempting to break a blockade, shall not be
seized and appropriated. In 1823 the United States
had already made the proposal to Great Britain, France,
and Russia<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> for a treaty abrogating the rule that
enemy merchantmen and enemy goods thereon may
be appropriated; but Russia alone accepted the proposal
under the condition that all other naval Powers
should consent. Again, in 1856,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> on the occasion of
the Declaration of Paris, the United States endeavoured
to obtain the victory of the principle that enemy
merchantmen shall not be appropriated, making it a

attempt failed, owing to the opposition of Great Britain.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of war in 1866, Prussia and Austria
expressly declared that they would not seize and
appropriate each other's merchantmen. At the outbreak
of the Franco-German War in 1870, Germany
declared French merchantmen exempt from capture,
but she changed her attitude when France did not act
upon the same lines. It should also be mentioned that
already in 1865 Italy, by article 211 of her Marine
Code, enacted that, in case of war with any other State,
enemy merchantmen not carrying contraband of war
or breaking a blockade shall not be seized and appropriated,
provided reciprocity be granted. And it
should further be mentioned that the United States of
America made attempts<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> in vain to secure immunity
from capture to enemy merchantmen and goods on sea
at the First as well as at the Second Hague Peace
Conference.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_353_353" id="Footnote_353_353"></a><a href="#FNanchor_353_353"><span class="label">[353]</span></a> See Holls, <i>The Peace Conference at the Hague</i>, pp. 306-321, and Scott,
<i>Conferences</i>, pp. 699-707.</p></div>

<p>It cannot be denied that the constant agitation,
since the middle of the eighteenth century, in favour of
the abolition of the rule that private enemy vessels
and goods may be captured on the High Seas, might,
during the second half of the nineteenth century, have
met with success but for the decided opposition of
Great Britain. Public opinion in Great Britain was
not, and is not, prepared to consent to the abolition of
this rule. And there is no doubt that the abolition of
the rule would involve a certain amount of danger to a
country like Great Britain whose position and power
depend chiefly upon her navy. The possibility of
annihilating an enemy's commerce by annihilating his
merchant fleet is a powerful weapon in the hands of a
great naval Power. Moreover, if enemy merchantmen
are not captured, they can be fitted out as cruisers, or at
least be made use of for the transport of troops, munitions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and provisions. Have not several maritime
States made arrangements with their steamship companies
to secure the building of their Transatlantic liners
according to plans which make these merchantmen
easily convertible into men-of-war?</p>

<p>The argument that it is unjust that private enemy
citizens should suffer through having their property
seized has no weight in face of the probability that fear
of the annihilation of its merchant fleet in case of war
may well deter a State intending to go to war from
doing so. It is a matter for politicians, not for jurists,
to decide whether Great Britain must in the interest of
self-preservation oppose the abolition of the rule that
sea-borne private enemy property may be confiscated.</p>

<p>However this may be, since the end of the nineteenth
century it has not been the attitude of Great Britain
alone which stands in the way of the abolition of the
rule. Since the growth of navies among continental
Powers, these Powers have learnt to appreciate the
value of the rule in war, and the outcry against the
capture of merchantmen has become less loud. To-day,
it may perhaps be said that, even if Great Britain were
to propose the abolition of the rule, it is probable that a
greater number of the maritime States would refuse to
accede. For it should be noted that at the Second
Peace Conference, France, Russia, Japan, Spain,
Portugal, Mexico, Colombia, and Panama, besides
Great Britain, voted against the abolition of the rule.
And there is noticeable a slow, but constant, increase
in the number of continental publicists<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> who oppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the abolition of the once so much objected to practice
of capturing enemy merchantmen.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_354_354" id="Footnote_354_354"></a><a href="#FNanchor_354_354"><span class="label">[354]</span></a> See, for instance, Perels, § 36, pp. 195-198; Röpcke, <i>Das

On the other hand, the Institute of International Law has several times

l'Institut de droit International</i> (1893), pp. 190-193. The literature

<p>§ 179. <a name="Be_that_as_it179" id="Be_that_as_it179"></a>Be that as it may, the time is not very far
distant when the Powers will perforce come to an
agreement on this as on other points of sea warfare,
in a code of regulations regarding sea warfare as a
pendant to the Hague Regulations regarding warfare

States of America by her Naval War Code<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> published in

the Second Peace Conference has produced a
number of Conventions dealing with some parts of
Sea Warfare, namely: (1) the Convention (VI.) concerning
the status of enemy merchantmen at the
outbreak of hostilities; (2) the Convention (VII.)
concerning the conversion of merchantmen into warships;
(3) the Convention (VIII.) concerning the
laying of automatic submarine contact mines; (4)
the Convention (IX.) concerning the bombardment by
naval forces; (5) the Convention (XI.) concerning
restrictions on the exercise of the right of capture in
maritime war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Importance of Attack and Seizure of Enemy Vessels.</p></div>

<p>§ 180. Whereas in land warfare all sorts of violence
against enemy individuals are the chief means, in sea
warfare attack and seizure of enemy vessels are the
most important means. For together with enemy
vessels, a belligerent takes possession of the enemy
individuals and enemy goods thereon, so that he can
appropriate vessels and goods, as well as detain those
enemy individuals who belong to the enemy armed
forces as prisoners of war. For this reason, and
compared with attack and seizure of enemy vessels,
violence against enemy persons and the other means of
sea warfare play only a secondary part, although such
means are certainly not unimportant. For a weak
naval Power can even restrict the operations of her
fleet to mere coast defence, and thus totally refrain
from directly attacking and seizing enemy vessels.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Attack
when
legitimate.</p></div>

<p>§ 181. <a name="All_enemy_men-of-war181" id="All_enemy_men-of-war181"></a>All enemy men-of-war and other public
vessels, which are met by a belligerent's men-of-war
on the High Seas or within the territorial waters of
either belligerent,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> may at once be attacked, and the
attacked vessel may, of course, defend herself by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
a counter-attack. Enemy merchantmen may be attacked
only if they refuse to submit to visit after
having been duly signalled to do so. And no duty
exists for an enemy merchantman to submit to visit;
on the contrary, she may refuse it, and defend herself
against an attack. But only a man-of-war is competent
to attack men-of-war as well as merchantmen,
provided the war takes place between parties to the
Declaration of Paris, so that privateering is prohibited.
Any merchantman of a belligerent attacking a public
or private vessel of the enemy would be considered
and treated as a pirate, and the members of the crew
would be liable to be treated as war criminals<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> to the
same extent as private individuals committing hostilities
in land warfare. However, if attacked by an
enemy vessel, a merchantman is competent to deliver
a counter-attack and need not discontinue her attack
because the vessel which opened hostilities takes to
flight, but may pursue and seize her.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_357_357" id="Footnote_357_357"></a><a href="#FNanchor_357_357"><span class="label">[357]</span></a> But not, of course, in territorial waters of neutral States; see the <i>De
Fortuyn</i> (1760), Burrell 175.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_358_358" id="Footnote_358_358"></a><a href="#FNanchor_358_358"><span class="label">[358]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#In_a_sense_the_crews85">85</a>, and below, § <a href="#Since_International_Law254">254</a>. Should a merchantman,
legitimately&mdash;after having been herself attacked&mdash;or illegitimately,
attack an enemy vessel, and succeed in capturing her, the prize, on
condemnation, becomes <i>droits</i> of Admiralty and, therefore, the property
of the British Government; see article 39 of the Naval Prize Act, 1864,
and article 44 of the Naval Prize Bill introduced in 1911.</p></div>

<p>It must be specially mentioned that an attack upon
enemy vessels on the sea may be made by forces on the
shore. For instance, this is done when coast batteries
fire upon an enemy man-of-war within reach of their
guns. Enemy merchantmen, however, may not be
attacked in this way, for they may only be attacked
by men-of-war after having been signalled in vain to
submit to visit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Attack
how
effected.</p></div>

<p>§ 182. One mode of attack which was in use at the
time of sailing ships, namely, boarding and fighting the
crew, which can be described as a parallel to assault in
land warfare, is no longer used, but if an instance
occurred, it would be perfectly lawful. Attack is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
nowadays effected by cannonade, torpedoes, and, if
opportunity arises, by ramming; and nothing forbids
an attack on enemy vessels by launching projectiles
and explosives from air-vessels, provided the belligerents
are not parties to the Declaration&mdash;see above,
 § <a href="#The_First_Hague_Peace114">114</a>&mdash;which prohibits such attacks. As a rule attacks
on merchantmen will be made by cannonade only, as
the attacking vessel aims at seizing her on account of
her value. But, in case the attacked vessel not only
takes to flight, but defends herself by a counter-attack,
all modes of attack are lawful against her, just as she
herself is justified in applying all modes of attack by
way of defence.</p>

<p>As regards attack by torpedoes, article 1 No. 3 of
Convention VIII. of the Second Peace Conference enacts
that it is forbidden to use torpedoes which do not become
harmless if they miss their mark.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Submarine Contact Mines.</p></div>

<p>§ 182<i>a</i>. A new mode of attack which requires special
attention<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> is that by means of floating mechanical, in
contradistinction to so-called electro-contact, mines.
The latter need not specially be discussed, because they
are connected with a battery on land, can naturally
only be laid within territorial waters, and present no
danger to neutral shipping except on the spot where
they are laid. But floating mechanical mines can be
dropped as well in the Open Sea as in territorial waters;
they can, moreover, drift away to any distance from
the spot where they were dropped and thus become
a great danger to navigation in general. Mechanical
mines were for the first time used, and by both parties,
in the Russo-Japanese War during the blockade of
Port Arthur in 1904, and the question of their admissibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
was at once raised in the press of all neutral
countries, the danger to neutral shipping being obvious.
The Second Peace Conference took the matter up and,
in spite of the opposing views of the Powers, was able
to produce the Convention (VIII.) concerning the
laying of automatic submarine contact mines. This
Convention comprises thirteen articles and was signed,
although by some only with reservations, by all the
Powers represented at the Conference, except China,
Montenegro, Nicaragua, Portugal, Russia, Spain, and
Sweden. Most of the signatory States have already
ratified, and Nicaragua has since acceded. The more
important stipulations of this Convention are the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Belligerents<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> are forbidden to lay <i>unanchored</i>
automatic contact mines, unless they be so constructed
as to become harmless one hour at most after those who
laid them have lost control over them, and it is forbidden
to lay <i>anchored</i> automatic contact mines which
do not become harmless as soon as they have broken
loose from their moorings (article 1).</p>

<p>(2) It is forbidden to lay automatic contact mines
off the coasts and ports of the enemy, with the sole
object of intercepting commercial navigation (article 2).<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>(3) When anchored automatic contact mines are
employed, every possible precaution must be taken for
the security of peaceful navigation. The belligerents
must provide, as far as possible, for these mines becoming
harmless after a limited time has elapsed, and,
where the mines cease to be under observation, to
notify the danger zones as soon as military exigencies
permit, by notice to mariners, which must also be
communicated to the Governments through the diplomatic
channel (article 3).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) At the close of the war, each Power must remove
the mines laid by it. As regards anchored automatic
contact mines laid by one of the belligerents off the
coasts of the other, their position must be notified
to the other party by the Power which laid them, and
each Power must proceed with the least possible delay
to remove the mines in its own waters (article 5).</p>

<p>(5) The Convention remains in force for seven years,
but, unless denounced, it continues in force afterwards
(article 11). According to article 12, however, the
contracting Powers agree to reopen the question of the
employment of automatic contact mines after six and
a half years unless the Third Peace Conference has
already taken up and settled the matter.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the stipulations of Convention
VIII. are totally inadequate to secure the
safety of neutral shipping, and it is for this reason that
Great Britain added the following reservation in signing
the Convention:&mdash;"In placing their signatures to this
Convention the British plenipotentiaries declare that
the mere fact that the said Convention does not prohibit
a particular act or proceeding must not be held
to debar His Britannic Majesty's Government from
contesting its legitimacy." It is to be hoped that the
Third Peace Conference will produce a more satisfactory
settlement of the problem. The Institute of
International Law studied the matter at its meetings
at Paris in 1910 and at Madrid in 1911, and produced
a <i>Règlementation</i><a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> <i>internationale de l'usage des mines
sous-marines et torpilles</i>, comprising nine articles, of
which the more important are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) It is forbidden to place anchored or unanchored
automatic mines in the Open Sea (the question of the
laying of electric contact mines in the Open Sea being
reserved for future consideration).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Belligerents may lay mines in their own and in
the enemy's territorial waters, but it is forbidden (<i>a</i>) to
lay unanchored automatic contact mines which do not
become harmless one hour at most after those who
laid them have lost control over them; (<i>b</i>) to lay
anchored automatic contact mines which do not become
harmless as soon as they have broken loose from
their moorings.</p>

<p>(3) A belligerent is only allowed to lay mines off
the coasts and ports of the enemy for naval and military
purposes, he is not allowed to lay them there in order
to establish or maintain a commercial blockade.</p>

<p>(4) If mines are laid, all precautions must be taken
for the safety of peaceful navigation, and belligerents
must, in especial, provide that mines become harmless
after a limited time has elapsed. In case mines cease
to be under observation the belligerents must, as soon
as military exigencies permit, notify the danger zones
to mariners and also to the Governments through the
diplomatic channel.</p>

<p>(5) The question as to the laying of mines in straits
is reserved for future consideration.</p>

<p>(6) At the end of the war each Power must remove
the mines laid by it. As regards anchored automatic
contact mines laid by one of the belligerents off the
coasts of the other, their position must be notified to
the other party by the Power which laid them, and
each Power must proceed with the least possible delay
to remove the mines in its own waters. The Power
whose duty it is to remove the mines after the war
must make known the date at which the removal of
the mines is complete.</p>

<p>(7) A violation of these rules involves responsibility
on the part of the guilty State. The State which has
laid the mines is presumed to be guilty unless the contrary
is proved, and an action may be brought against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the guilty State, even by individuals who have suffered

<p>§ 183. As soon as an attacked or counter-attacked
vessel hauls down her flag and, therefore, signals that
she is ready to surrender, she must be given quarter
and seized without further firing. To continue an
attack although she is ready to surrender, and to

customary International Law, and would only as an
exception be admissible in case of imperative necessity
or of reprisals.</p>

<p>§ 184. Seizure is effected by securing possession of
the vessel through the captor sending an officer and
some of his own crew on board the captured vessel.
But if for any reason this is impracticable, the captor
orders the captured vessel to lower her flag and to steer
according to his orders.</p>

<p>§ 185. <a name="The_effect_of_seizure185" id="The_effect_of_seizure185"></a>The effect of seizure is different with regard
to private enemy vessels, on the one hand, and, on the
other, to public vessels.</p>

<p>Seizure of <i>private</i> enemy vessels may be described
as a parallel to occupation of enemy territory in land
warfare. Since the vessel and the individuals and
goods thereon are actually placed under the captor's
authority, her officers and crew, and any private individuals
on board, are for the time being submitted to
the discipline of the captor, just as private individuals
on occupied enemy territory are submitted to the
authority of the occupant.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Seizure of private enemy

be converted by the captor into a

1 Dodson 105 and 397, which are
quoted in favour of such a practice,
are not decisive. See Higgins, <i>War

<p>On the other hand, the effect of seizure of <i>public</i>
enemy vessels is their immediate and final appropriation.
They may be either taken into a port or
at once destroyed. All individuals on board become
prisoners of war, although, if perchance there should
be on board a private enemy individual of no importance,
he would probably not be kept for long in
captivity, but liberated in due time.</p>

<p>As regards goods on captured public enemy vessels,
there is no doubt that the effect of seizure is the immediate
appropriation of such goods on the vessels concerned
as are enemy property, and these goods may
therefore be destroyed at once, if desirable. Should,
however, neutral goods be on board a captured enemy
public vessel, it is a moot point whether or no they
share the fate of the captured ship. According to
British practice they do, but according to American
practice they do not.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Immunity of Vessels charged with Religious, Scientific, or
Philanthropic Mission.</p></div>

<p>§ 186. Enemy vessels engaged in scientific discovery
and exploration were, according to a general international
usage in existence before the Second Peace
Conference of 1907, granted immunity from attack and
seizure in so far and so long as they themselves abstained
from hostilities. The usage grew up in the
eighteenth century. In 1766, the French explorer
Bougainville, who started from St. Malo with the
vessels <i>La Boudeuse</i> and <i>L'Étoile</i> on a voyage round
the world, was furnished by the British Government
with safe-conducts. In 1776, Captain Cook's vessels
<i>Resolution</i> and <i>Discovery</i>, sailing from Plymouth for the
purpose of exploring the Pacific Ocean, were declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
exempt from attack and seizure on the part of French
cruisers by the French Government. Again, the
French Count Lapérouse, who started on a voyage of
exploration in 1785 with the vessels <i>Astrolabe</i> and
<i>Boussole</i>, was secured immunity from attack and
seizure. During the nineteenth century this usage
became quite general, and had almost ripened into a
custom; examples are the Austrian cruiser <i>Novara</i>
(1859) and the Swedish cruiser <i>Vega</i> (1878). No
immunity, however, was granted to vessels charged
with religious or philanthropic missions. A remarkable
case occurred during the Franco-German war.
In June, 1871, the <i>Palme</i>, a vessel belonging to the
Missionary Society of Basle, was captured by a French
man-of-war, and condemned by the Prize Court of
Bordeaux. The owners appealed and the French
Conseil d'État set the vessel free, not because the
capture was not justified but because equity demanded
that the fact that Swiss subjects owning sea-going
vessels were obliged to have them sailing under the flag
of another State, should be taken into consideration.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>The Second Peace Conference embodied the previous
usage concerning immunity of vessels of discovery
and exploration in a written rule and extended the
immunity to vessels with a religious or philanthropic
mission, for article 4 of Convention XI. enacts that
vessels charged with religious, scientific, or philanthropic
missions are exempt from capture.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Immunity

Trade.</p></div>

<p>§ 187. Coast fishing-boats, in contradistinction to
boats engaged in deep-sea fisheries, were, according to
a general, but not universal, custom in existence during
the nineteenth century, granted immunity from attack
and seizure so long and in so far as they were unarmed
and were innocently employed in catching and bringing
in fish.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> As early as the sixteenth century treaties
were concluded between single States stipulating such
immunity to each other's fishing-boats for the time of
war. But throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries there were instances of a contrary practice,
and Lord Stowell refused<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> to recognise in strict law
any such exemption, although he recognised a rule
of comity to that extent. Great Britain has always
taken the standpoint that any immunity granted by her
to fishing-boats was a relaxation<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> of strict right in the
interest of humanity, but revocable at any moment,
and that her cruisers were justified in seizing enemy
fishing-boats unless prevented therefrom by special
instructions on the part of the Admiralty.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> But at the
Second Peace Conference she altered her attitude, and
agreed to the immunity not only of fishing vessels, but
also of small boats employed in local trade. Article 3
of Convention XI. enacts, therefore, that vessels employed
exclusively in coast fisheries, and small boats
employed in local trade, are, together with appliances,
rigging, tackle, and cargo, exempt from capture.</p>

<p>It must be specially observed that boats engaged
in deep-sea fisheries and large boats engaged in local
trade do not enjoy the privilege of immunity from
capture, and that the fishing vessels and small boats
employed in local trade lose that privilege in case they
take any part whatever in hostilities. And article 3<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
expressly stipulates that belligerents must not take
advantage of the harmless character of the said boats
in order to use them for military purposes while preserving
their peaceful appearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Immunity
of Merchantmen
at the
Outbreak

on their
Voyage to
and from

Port.</p></div>

<p>§ 188. Several times at the outbreak of war
during the nineteenth century belligerents decreed
that such enemy merchantmen as were on their voyage
to one of the former's ports at the outbreak of war,
should not be attacked and seized during the period
of their voyage to and from such port. Thus, at the
outbreak of the Crimean War, Great Britain and
France decreed such immunity for Russian vessels,
Germany did the same with regard to French vessels
in 1870,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Russia with regard to Turkish vessels in
1877, the United States with regard to Spanish vessels
in 1898, Russia and Japan with regard to each other's
vessels in 1904. But there is no rule of International
Law which compels a belligerent to grant such days of
grace, and it is probable that in future wars days of
grace will not be granted. The reason is that the
steamboats of many countries are now built, according
to an arrangement with the Government of their
home State, from special designs which make them
easily convertible into cruisers, and that a belligerent
fleet cannot nowadays remain effective for long without
being accompanied by a train of transport-vessels,
colliers, repairing-vessels, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>In case, however, merchantmen, other than those
constructed on special lines in order to make them
easily convertible into cruisers, are, at the outbreak of
war, on their voyage to an enemy port and are ignorant
of the outbreak of hostilities, article 3 of Convention
VI.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> of the Second Peace Conference must find application.
They may not, therefore, be confiscated, but may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>

after the conclusion of peace, or that indemnities shall

<p>§ 189. <a name="Instances_have189" id="Instances_have189"></a>Instances have occurred when enemy vessels

the <i>Elisabeth</i>, a British man-of-war, was forced to take
refuge in the port of Havanna, she was not seized, but
was offered facility for repairing damages, and furnished
with a safe-conduct as far as the Bermudas. Thus,
further, when in 1799, during war with France, the
<i>Diana</i>, a Prussian merchantman, was forced to take
refuge in the port of Dunkirk and seized, she was restored
by the French Prize Court. But these and other
cases have not created any rule of International Law
whereby immunity from attack and seizure is granted
to vessels in distress, and no such rule is likely to grow
up, especially not as regards men-of-war and such
merchantmen as are easily convertible into cruisers.</p>

<p>Whereas there is no general rule granting immunity

<p>§ 192. <a name="It_has_already192" id="It_has_already192"></a>It has already been stated above, in § <a href="#The_effect_of_seizure185">185</a>,
that the capture of a private enemy vessel has to
be confirmed by a Prize Court, and that it is only
through the latter's adjudication that the vessel becomes
finally appropriated. The origin<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> of Prize
Courts is to be traced back to the end of the Middle
Ages. During the Middle Ages, after the Roman Empire
had broken up, a state of lawlessness established itself
on the High Seas. Piratical vessels of the Danes
covered the North Sea and the Baltic, and navigation
of the Mediterranean Sea was threatened by Greek and
Saracen pirates. Merchantmen, therefore, associated
themselves for mutual protection and sailed as a
merchant fleet under a specially elected chief, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
so-called Admiral. They also occasionally sent out a
fleet of armed vessels for the purpose of sweeping
pirates from certain parts of the High Seas. Piratical
vessels and goods which were captured were divided
among the captors according to a decision of their
Admiral. During the thirteenth century the maritime
States of Europe themselves endeavoured to keep
order on the Open Sea. By-and-by armed vessels were
obliged to be furnished with Letters Patent or Letters
of Marque from the Sovereign of a maritime State and
their captures submitted to the official control of such
State as had furnished them with their Letters. A
board, called the Admiralty, was instituted by maritime
States, and officers of that Board of Admiralty exercised
control over the armed vessels and their captures,
inquiring in each case<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> into the legitimation of the
captor and the nationality of the captured vessel and
her goods. And after modern International Law had
grown up, it was a recognised customary rule that in
time of war the Admiralty of maritime belligerents
should be obliged to institute a Court<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> or Courts
whenever a prize was captured by public vessels or
privateers in order to decide whether the capture was
lawful or not. These Courts were called Prize Courts.
This institution has come down to our times, and
nowadays all maritime States either constitute permanent
Prize Courts, or appoint them specially in
each case of an outbreak of war. The whole institution
is essentially one in the interest of neutrals, since
belligerents want to be guarded by a decision of a
Court against claims of neutral States regarding alleged
unjustified capture of neutral vessels and goods. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
capture of any private vessel, whether <i>prima facie</i> belonging
to an enemy or a neutral, must, therefore, be
submitted to a Prize Court. Article 1 of Convention XII.
(as yet unratified) of the Second Peace Conference now
expressly enacts the old customary rule that "the
validity of the capture of a merchantman or its cargo,
when neutral or enemy property is involved, is decided
before a Prize Court." It must, however, be emphasised
that the ordinary Prize-Courts are not International
Courts, but National Courts instituted by
Municipal Law, and that the law they administer is
Municipal Law,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> based on custom, statutes, or special
regulations of their State. Every State is, however,
bound by International Law to enact only such statutes
and regulations<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> for its Prize Courts as are in conformity
with International Law. A State may, therefore,
instead of making special regulations, directly
order its Prize Courts to apply the rules of International
Law, and it is understood that, when no statutes are
enacted or regulations are given, Prize Courts have to
apply International Law. Prize Courts may be instituted
by belligerents in any part of their territory
or the territories of allies, but not on neutral territory.
It would nowadays constitute a breach of neutrality on
the part of a neutral State to allow the institution on its
territory of a Prize Court.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

the Prize Courts of belligerents (article 2), but, according

such cases necessarily come before the International
Prize Court at the second appeal. This means that
belligerents, besides Prize Courts of the first instance,
may set up a Prize Court of Appeal, but they may not
set up a second Court of Appeal above the first, except

<p>§ 193. <a name="As_soon_as_a_vessel193" id="As_soon_as_a_vessel193"></a>As soon as a vessel is seized she must be
conducted to a port where a Prize Court is sitting. As
a rule the officer and the crew sent on board the prize
by the captor will navigate the prize to the port. This
officer can ask the master and crew of the vessel to
assist him, but, if they refuse, they may not be compelled
thereto. The captor need not accompany the
prize to the port. In the exceptional case, however,
where an officer and crew cannot be sent on board and
the captured vessel is ordered to lower her flag and to
steer according to orders, the captor must conduct the
prize to the port. To which port a prize is to be taken
is not for International Law to determine; the latter
says only that the prize must be taken straight to a
port of a Prize Court, and only in case of distress or
necessity is delay allowed. If the neutral State concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
gives permission,<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> the prize may, in case of
distress or in case she is in such bad condition as prevents
her from being taken to a port of a Prize Court,
be taken to a near neutral port, and, if admitted, the
capturing man-of-war as well as the prize enjoy there
the privilege of exterritoriality. But as soon as
circumstances allow, the prize must be conducted from
the neutral port to that of the Prize Court, and only if
the condition of the prize does not at all allow this,
may the Prize Court give its verdict in the absence of
the prize after the ship papers of the prize and witnesses
have been produced before it.</p>

<p>The whole of the crew of the prize are, as a rule,
to be kept on board and to be brought before the Prize
Court. But if this is impracticable, several important
members of the crew, such as the master, mate, or
supercargo, must be kept on board, whereas the others
may be removed and forwarded to the port of the
Prize Court by other means of transport. The whole
of the cargo is, as a rule, also to remain on board the
prize. But if the whole or part of the cargo is in a
condition which prevents it from being sent to the
port of the Prize Court, it may, according to the needs
of the case, either be destroyed or sold in the nearest
port, and in the latter case an account of the sale has
to be sent to the Prize Court. All neutral goods amongst
the cargo are also to be taken to the port of adjudication,
although they have now, according to the Declaration
of Paris, to be restored to their neutral owners. But
if such neutral goods are not in a condition to be taken
to the port of adjudication, they may likewise be sold or
destroyed, as the case may require.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Destruction of Prize.</p></div>

<p>§ 194. <a name="Since_through_adjudication194" id="Since_through_adjudication194"></a>Since through adjudication by the Prize
Courts the ownership of captured private enemy vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
becomes finally transferred to the belligerent whose
forces made the capture, it is evident that after transfer
the captured vessel as well as her cargo may be destroyed.
On the other hand, it is likewise evident
that, since a verdict of a Prize Court is necessary before
the appropriation of the prize becomes final, a captured
merchantman must not as a rule be destroyed instead
of being conducted to the port of a Prize Court. There
are, however, exceptions to the rule, but no unanimity
exists in theory or practice as regards those exceptions.
Whereas some<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> consider the destruction of a prize
allowable only in case of imperative necessity, others<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
allow it in nearly every case of convenience. Thus, the
Government of the United States of America, on the
outbreak of war with England in 1812, instructed the
commanders of her vessels to destroy at once all captures,
the very valuable excepted, because a single cruiser,
however successful, could man a few prizes only, but
by destroying each capture would be able to continue
capturing, and thereby constantly diminish the enemy
merchant fleet.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> During the Civil War in America the
cruisers of the Southern Confederated States destroyed
all enemy prizes because there was no port open for
them to bring prizes to. And during the Russo-Japanese
War, Russian cruisers destroyed twenty-one
captured Japanese merchantmen.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> According to
British practice,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> the captor is allowed to destroy the
prize in only two cases&mdash;namely, first, when the prize is
in such a condition as prevents her from being sent to
any port of adjudication; and, secondly, when the capturing
vessel is unable to spare a prize crew to navigate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the prize into such a port. The <i>Règlement international
des prises maritimes</i> of the Institute of International
Law enumerates in § 50 five cases in which destruction
of the capture is allowed&mdash;namely (1) when the condition
of the vessel and the weather make it impossible
to keep the prize afloat; (2) when the vessel navigates so
slowly that she cannot follow the captor and is therefore
exposed to an easy recapture by the enemy; (3)
when the approach of a superior enemy force creates the
fear that the prize might be recaptured by the enemy; (4)
when the captor cannot spare a prize crew; (5) when the
port of adjudication to which the prize might be taken
is too far from the spot where the capture was made.
Be that as it may,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> in every case of destruction of
the vessel the captor must remove crew, ship papers,
and, if possible, the cargo, before the destruction of
the prize, and must afterwards send crew, papers, and
cargo to a port of a Prize Court for the purpose of satisfying
the latter that both the capture and the destruction
were lawful.</p>

<p>But if destruction of a captured enemy merchantman
can as an exception be lawful, the question as to
indemnities to be paid to the neutral owners of goods
carried by the destroyed vessel requires attention. It
seems to be obvious that, if the destruction of the
vessel herself was lawful, and if it was not possible to
remove her cargo, no indemnities need be paid. An
illustrative case happened during the Franco-German
War. On October 21, 1870, the French cruiser <i>Dessaix</i>
seized two German merchantmen, the <i>Ludwig</i> and the
<i>Vorwärts</i>, but burned them because she could not spare
a prize crew to navigate the prizes into a French port.
The neutral owners of part of the cargo claimed indemnities,
but the French Conseil d'État refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
grant indemnities on the ground that the action of the
captor was lawful.<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

Dupuis, No. 262; Hall, § 269. Should the International Prize Court at
the Hague be established, article 3 of Convention XII. of the Second
Peace Conference would enable the owners of neutral goods destroyed with
the destroyed enemy merchantmen that carried them to bring the question
as to whether they may claim damages before this Court.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Ransom of Prize.</p></div>

<p>§ 195. <a name="Although_prizes195" id="Although_prizes195"></a>Although prizes have as a rule to be brought
before a Prize Court, International Law nevertheless
does not forbid the ransoming of the captured vessel
either directly after the capture or after she has been
conducted to the port of a Prize Court, but before the
Court has given its verdict. However, the practice of
accepting and paying ransom, which grew up in the
seventeenth century, is in many countries now prohibited
by Municipal Law. Thus, for instance, Great
Britain by section 45 of the Naval Prize Act, 1864,
prohibits ransoming except in such cases as may be
specially provided for by an Order of the King in
Council.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> Where ransom is accepted, a contract of
ransom is entered into by the captor and the master
of the captured vessel; the latter gives a so-called
ransom bill to the former, in which he promises the
amount of the ransom. He is given a copy of the
ransom bill for the purpose of a safe-conduct to protect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
his vessel from again being captured, under the condition
that he keeps the course to such port as is agreed
upon in the ransom bill. To secure the payment of
ransom, an officer of the captured vessel can be detained
as hostage, otherwise the whole of the crew is
to be liberated with the vessel, ransom being an equivalent
for both the restoration of the prize and the
release of her crew from captivity. So long as the
ransom bill is not paid, the hostage can be kept in
captivity. But it is exclusively a matter for the
Municipal Law of the State concerned to determine
whether or no the captor can sue upon the ransom
bill, if the ransom is not voluntarily paid.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Should the
capturing vessel, with the hostage or the ransom bill on
board, be captured herself and thus become a prize of
the enemy, the hostage is liberated, the ransom bill
loses its effect, and need not be paid.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

</p><p>
(1) His Majesty in Council may, in relation to any war, make such orders

ransoming of any ship or goods belonging to any of His Majesty's
subjects, and taken as prize by any of His Majesty's enemies.
</p><p>
(2) Any contract or agreement entered into, and any bill, bond, or other
security given for ransom of any ship or goods, shall be under the
exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court as a Prize Court (subject to
appeal to the Supreme Prize Court) and if entered into or given in
contravention to any such Order in Council shall be deemed to have been
entered into or given for an illegal consideration.
</p><p>
(3) If any person ransoms or enters into any contract or agreement for
ransoming any ship or goods, in contravention of any such Order in

Courts, in contradistinction to the British, recognise ransom bills. See
on the one hand, the case of <i>Cornu</i> v. <i>Blackburne</i> (1781), 2 Douglas,

<div class="sidenote"><p>Loss of
Prize,
especially
Recapture.</p></div>

<p>§ 196. <a name="A_prize_is_lost196" id="A_prize_is_lost196"></a>A prize is lost&mdash;(1) when the captor intentionally
abandons her, (2) when she escapes through
being rescued by her own crew, or (3) when she is recaptured.
Just as through capture the prize becomes,
according to International Law, the property of the
belligerent whose forces made the capture, provided
a Prize Court confirms the capture, so such property
is lost when the prize vessel becomes abandoned, or
escapes, or is recaptured. And it seems to be obvious,
and everywhere recognised by Municipal Law, that as
soon as a captured enemy merchantman succeeds in
escaping, the proprietorship of the former owners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
revives <i>ipso facto</i>. But the case is different when a
captured vessel, whose crew has been taken on board
the capturing vessel, is abandoned and afterwards
met and taken possession of by a neutral vessel or by
a vessel of her home State. It is certainly not for
International Law to determine whether or not the
original proprietorship revives through abandonment.
This is a matter for Municipal Law. The case of
recapture is different from escape. Here too Municipal
Law has to determine whether or no the former proprietorship
revives, since International Law lays down
the rule only that recapture takes the vessel out of the
property of the enemy and brings her into the property
of the belligerent whose forces made the recapture.
Municipal Law of the individual States has settled
the matter in different ways. Thus, Great Britain, by
section 40 of the Naval Prize Act, 1864, enacted that
the recaptured vessel, except when she has been used
by the captor as a ship of war, shall be restored to her
former owner on his paying one-eighth to one-fourth,
as the Prize Court may award, of her value as prize
salvage, no matter if the recapture was made before or
after the enemy Prize Court had confirmed the capture.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
Other States restore a recaptured vessel only when the
recapture was made within twenty-four hours<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> after
the capture occurred, or before the captured vessel was
conducted into an enemy port, or before she was condemned
by an enemy Prize Court.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Fate of
Prize.</p></div>

<p>§ 197. Through being captured and afterwards condemned
by a Prize Court, a captured enemy vessel
and captured enemy goods become the property of
the belligerent whose forces made the capture. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
becomes of the prize after the condemnation is not for
International, but for Municipal Law to determine.
A belligerent can hand the prize over to the officers
and crew who made the capture, or can keep her
altogether for himself, or can give a share to those who
made the capture. As a rule, prizes are sold after they
are condemned, and the whole or a part of the net
proceeds is distributed among the officers and crew who
made the capture. For Great Britain this distribution
is regulated by the "Royal Proclamation as to Distribution
of Prize Money" of August 3, 1886.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> There
is no doubt whatever that, if a neutral subject buys a
captured ship after her condemnation, she may not be
attacked and captured by the belligerent to whose subject
she formerly belonged, although, if she is bought
by an enemy subject and afterwards captured, she
might be restored<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> to her former owner.</p>

<p>§ 198. It has been already stated above in § <a href="#The_general_rule89">89</a>
that merchantmen owned by subjects of neutral States
but sailing under enemy flag are vested with enemy
character. It is, therefore, evident that they may be
captured and condemned. As at present no non-littoral
State has a maritime flag, vessels belonging to
subjects of such States are forced to navigate under the
flag of another State,<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> and they are, therefore, in case
of war exposed to capture.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Sale of Enemy Vessels during War.</p></div>

<p>§ 199. Since enemy vessels are liable to capture,
the question must be taken into consideration whether
the fact that an enemy vessel has been sold during the
war to a subject of a neutral or to a subject of the
belligerent State whose forces seized her, has the effect
of excluding her appropriation. It is obvious that, if
the question is answered in the affirmative, the owners
of enemy vessels can evade the danger of having their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
property captured by selling their vessels. The question
of transfer of enemy vessels must, therefore, be
regarded as forming part of the larger questions of
enemy character and has consequently been treated in
detail above, § 91.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Goods
sold by

Subjects
during

<p>§ 200. If a captured enemy vessel carries goods
consigned by enemy subjects to subjects of neutral
States, or to subjects of the belligerent whose forces
captured the vessel, they may not be appropriated,
provided the consignee can prove that he is the owner.
As regards such goods found on captured enemy merchantmen
as are consigned to enemy subjects but have
been sold <i>in transitu</i> to subjects of neutral States, no
unanimous practice of the different States is in existence.
The subject of goods sold <i>in transitu</i> must&mdash;in
the same way as the question of transfer of enemy
vessels&mdash;be considered as forming part of the larger
question of enemy character. It has, for this reason,
been treated above, § 92.</p>

<p>§ 204. <a name="Soon_after204" id="Soon_after204"></a>Soon after the ratification of the Geneva
Convention the necessity of adapting its principles
to naval warfare was generally recognised, and among
the non-ratified Additional articles to the Geneva
Convention of 1868 were nine which aimed at such
an adaptation. But it was not until the Hague
Peace Conference in 1899 that an adaptation came
into legal existence. This adaptation was contained
in the "Convention<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> for the Adaptation to Maritime
Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention of
August 22, 1864," which comprised fourteen articles.
It has, however, been replaced by the "Convention (X.)
for the Adaptation of the Principles of the Geneva
Convention to Maritime War," of the Second Hague
Peace Conference. This new convention comprises
twenty-eight articles and was signed, although with
some reservations, by all the Powers represented at the
Conference, except Nicaragua which acceded later,
and it has already been ratified by most of the signatory
Powers. It provides rules concerning the wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>

It is left to the captor to determine whether they are

to ensure the dead protection against pillage and maltreatment,
and they must see that the burial, whether
by land or sea, or cremation of the dead is preceded by
a careful examination of the corpses in order to determine
that life is really extinct (article 16). Each
belligerent must, as early as possible, send to the authorities

identification marks or tokens found on the dead;
they must also collect all the objects of personal use,
valuables, letters, &amp;c., which have been left by the

<div class="sidenote"><p>Hospital Ships.</p></div>

<p>§ 206. Three different kinds of hospital ships must
be distinguished&mdash;namely, military hospital ships, hospital
ships equipped by private individuals or relief
societies of the belligerents, and hospital ships equipped
by private neutral individuals and neutral relief
societies.</p>

<p>(1) Military hospital ships (article 1) are ships constructed
or assigned by States specially and solely for
the purpose of assisting the wounded, sick, and shipwrecked.
Their names must be communicated to the
belligerents at the commencement of or during hostilities,
and in any case before they are employed.
They must be respected by the belligerents, they may
not be captured while hostilities last, and they are not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the same footing as men-of-war during their stay in a
neutral port.</p>

<p>(2) Hospital ships equipped wholly or in part at the
cost of private individuals or officially recognised relief
societies of the belligerents must be respected by
either belligerent (article 2), and are exempt from
capture, provided their home State has given them an
official commission and has notified their names to
the other belligerent at the commencement of or during
hostilities, and in any case before they are employed.
They must, further, be furnished with a certificate
from the competent authorities declaring that they
had been under the latter's control while fitting out
and on final departure.</p>

<p>(3) Hospital ships, equipped wholly or in part at the
cost of private individuals or officially recognised relief
societies of neutral States (article 3), must likewise be
respected, and are exempt from capture, provided that
they are placed under the control of one of the belligerents,
with the previous consent of their own Government
and with the authorisation of the belligerent
himself, and that the latter has notified their names
to his adversary at the commencement of, or during,
hostilities, and in any case before they are employed.</p>

<p>According to article 4 all military and other hospital
ships must afford relief and assistance to the wounded,
sick, and shipwrecked of either belligerent. The respective
Governments are prohibited from using these
ships for any military purpose. The commanders of
these vessels must not in any way hamper the movements
of the combatants, and during and after an
engagement they act at their own risk and peril. Both
belligerents have a right to control and visit all military
and other hospital ships, to refuse their assistance, to
order them off, to make them take a certain course, to
put a commissioner on board, and, lastly, to detain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
them temporarily, if important circumstances require
this. In case a hospital ship receives orders from a
belligerent, these orders must, as far as possible, be
inscribed in the ship papers.</p>

<p>The protection to which hospital ships are entitled
ceases if they are made use of to commit acts harmful
to the enemy<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> (article 8). But the fact of the staff being
armed for the purpose of maintaining order and defending
the wounded and sick, and the fact of the
presence of wireless telegraphic apparatus on board,
are not sufficient reasons for withdrawing protection.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_415_415" id="Footnote_415_415"></a><a href="#FNanchor_415_415"><span class="label">[415]</span></a> An interesting case of this kind occurred during the
Russo-Japanese war. The <i>Aryol</i> (also called the <i>Orel</i>), a hospital
ship of the Russian Red Cross Society, was captured, and afterwards
condemned by the Prize Court on the following grounds:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) For having
communicated the orders of the commander-in-chief of the Russian
squadron with which she was sailing to other Russian vessels; (<i>b</i>) for
carrying, by order of the commander-in-chief of the squadron, in order
to take them to Vladivostock, the master and some members of the crew of
the British steamship <i>Oldhamia</i>, which had been captured by the
Russians; (<i>c</i>) for having been instructed to purchase in Cape Town, or

<p>It must be specially observed that any man-of-war
of either belligerent may, according to article 12, demand
the surrender of the wounded, sick, or shipwrecked who
are on board hospital ships of any kind. According to

"to apply only to the case of combatants rescued
during or after a naval engagement in which they have
taken part."</p>

<p>§ 206<i>a</i>. For the purpose of defining the status of
hospital ships when entering neutral ports an International
Conference met at the Hague in 1904, where
Germany, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, China, Korea,
Denmark, Spain, the United States of America, France,
Greece, Guatemala, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, Mexico,
Holland, Persia, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia, and
Siam, were represented. Great Britain, however, did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
take part. The following is the text of the six articles
of the Convention signed by all the representatives:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">Article 1.&mdash;Hospital ships fulfilling the conditions prescribed
in articles 1, 2, and 3 of the Convention concluded at the Hague
on July 27, 1899, for the adaptation of the principles of the
Geneva Convention of August 22, 1864, to naval warfare shall in
time of war be exempt in the ports of the contracting parties
from all dues and taxes imposed on vessels for the benefit of the
State.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Article 2.&mdash;The provision contained in the preceding article
shall not prevent the exercise of the right of search and other
formalities demanded by the fiscal and other laws in force in
the said ports.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Article 3.&mdash;The regulation laid down in article 1 is binding
only upon the contracting Powers in case of war between two or
more of themselves. The said rule shall cease to be obligatory
as soon as in a war between any of the contracting Powers a
non-contracting Power shall join one of the belligerents.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Article 4.&mdash;The present Convention, which bears date of
this day and may be signed up to October 1, 1905, by any Power
which shall have expressed a wish to do so, shall be ratified
as speedily as possible. The ratifications shall be deposited at
the Hague. On the deposit of the ratifications, a <i>procès-verbal</i>
shall be drawn up, of which a certified copy shall be conveyed by
diplomatic channels, after the deposit of each ratification, to all
the contracting Powers.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Article 5.&mdash;Non-signatory Powers will be allowed to adhere
to the present convention after October 1, 1905. For that
purpose they will have to make known the fact of their adhesion
to the contracting Powers by means of a written notification
addressed to the Government of the Netherlands, which will be
communicated by that Government to all the other contracting
Powers.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Article 6.&mdash;In the event of any of the high contracting
parties denouncing the present Convention, the denunciation
shall only take effect after notification has been made in writing
to the Government of the Netherlands and communicated by
that Government at once to all the other contracting Powers.
Such denunciation shall be effective only in respect of the Power
which shall have given notice of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Sick-Bays.</p></div>

<p>§ 206<i>b</i>. According to article 7, in case of a fight on
board a man-of-war, the sick-bays must, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
possible, be respected and spared. These sick-bays,
and the material belonging to them, remain subject to
the laws of war; they may not, however, be used for
any purpose other than that for which they were
originally intended so long as they are required for the
wounded and sick. But should the military situation
require it, a commander into whose power they have
fallen may nevertheless apply them to other purposes,
under the condition that he previously makes arrangements
for proper accommodation for the wounded and
sick on board. The protection to which sick-bays are
entitled ceases if they are made use of to commit acts
harmful to the enemy (article 8). But the fact that
the staff of sick-bays is armed in order to defend the
wounded and sick is not sufficient reason for withdrawing
protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Distinctive
Colour
and Emblem
of
Hospital
Ships.</p></div>

<p>§ 207. <a name="All_military207" id="All_military207"></a>All military hospital ships must be painted
white outside with a horizontal band of green about
one metre and a half in breadth. Other hospital ships
must also be painted white outside, but with a horizontal
band of red. The boats and small craft of
hospital ships used for hospital work must likewise be
painted white. And besides being painted in this distinguishing
colour, all military and other hospital ships
(article 5) must hoist, together with their national flag,
the white flag with a red cross stipulated by the Geneva
Convention. If they belong to a neutral State, they
must also fly at the main mast the national flag of
the belligerent under whose control they are placed.
Hospital ships which, under the terms of article 4, are
detained by the enemy, must haul down the national
flag of the belligerent to whom they belong. All
hospital ships which wish to ensure by night the
freedom from interference to which they are entitled,
must, subject to the assent of the belligerent they are
accompanying, take the necessary measures to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
their special painting sufficiently plain. According to
article 6 the distinguishing signs mentioned in article 5
may only be used, whether in time of peace or war, for
protecting or indicating the ships therein mentioned.</p>

<p>Although in this connection the red cross is especially
stipulated as the distinctive emblem, there is no objection
to the use by non-Christian States, who object
to the cross on religious grounds, of another emblem.
Thus Turkey reserved the right to use a red crescent,
and Persia to use a red sun.</p>

<p>§ 209<i>a</i>. The provisions of Convention X. are only
binding in the case of war between contracting Powers,
they cease to be binding the moment a non-contracting
Power becomes one of the belligerents (article 18). In
the case of operations of war between land and sea
forces of belligerents, the provisions of Convention X.
only apply to forces on board ship (article 22). The
commanders-in-chief of the belligerent fleets must, in
accordance with the instructions of their Governments
and in conformity with the general principles of the
Convention, arrange the details for carrying out the
articles of Convention X., as well as for cases not
provided for in these articles (article 19). The contracting
parties must take the necessary measures to
instruct their naval forces, especially the personnel
protected by Convention X., in the provisions of the
Convention, and to bring these provisions to the notice of
the public (article 20). The contracting Powers must, in
case their criminal laws are inadequate, enact measures

1899 for the adaptation to naval warfare of the
principles of the Geneva Convention, but this latter
Convention remains in force between such of its contracting
parties as do not become parties to Convention
X. (article 25). Such non-signatory Powers of Convention
X. as are parties to the Geneva Convention of
1906 are free to accede at any time, and a Power desiring
to accede must notify its intention in writing to
the Dutch Government which must communicate the
accession to all the contracting Powers (article 24).
Each of the contracting Powers is at any time at liberty
to denounce Convention X. by a written notification
to the Dutch Government which must immediately
communicate the notification to all the other contracting
Powers; the denunciation, however, does not
take effect until one year after the notification has
reached the Dutch Government, and a denunciation
only affects the Power making the notification (article
27). A register kept by the Dutch Minister of
Foreign Affairs must record the dates of the deposit
of ratifications, as well as the dates of accessions
or of denunciations; each contracting Power is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>

within the same limits as in land warfare, perfidy being
excluded. As regards the use of a false flag, it is by
most publicists considered perfectly lawful for a man-of-war
to use a neutral's or the enemy's flag (1) when
chasing an enemy vessel, (2) when trying to escape, and
(3) for the purpose of drawing an enemy vessel into
action.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> On the other hand, it is universally agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
that immediately before an attack a vessel must fly
her national flag. Halleck (I. p. 568) relates the
following instance: In 1783 the <i>Sybille</i>, a French
frigate of thirty-eight guns, enticed the British man-of-war
<i>Hussar</i> by displaying the British flag and intimating
herself to be a distressed prize of a British captor. The
<i>Hussar</i> approached to succour her, but the latter at
once attacked the <i>Hussar</i> without showing the French
flag. She was, however, overpowered and captured,
and the commander of the <i>Hussar</i> publicly broke the
sword of the commander of the <i>Sybille</i>, whom he justly
accused of perfidy, although the French commander
was acquitted when subsequently brought to trial by
the French Government. Again, Halleck (I. p. 568)
relates: In 1813 two merchants of New York carried
out a plan for destroying the British man-of-war
<i>Ramillies</i> in the following way. A schooner with some
casks of flour on deck was expressly laden with several
casks of gunpowder having trains leading from a
species of gunlock, which, by the action of clockwork,
went off at a given time after it had been set.
To entice the <i>Ramillies</i> to seize her, the schooner came
up, and the <i>Ramillies</i> then sent a boat with thirteen
men and a lieutenant to cut her off. Subsequently
the crew of the schooner abandoned her and she blew
up with the lieutenant and his men on board.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_421_421" id="Footnote_421_421"></a><a href="#FNanchor_421_421"><span class="label">[421]</span></a> The use of a false flag on the part of a belligerent
man-of-war is analogous to the use of the enemy flag and the like in
land warfare; see above, § <a href="#Of_ruses_there164">164</a>. British practice&mdash;see Holland, <i>Prize
Law</i>, § 200&mdash;permits the use of false colours. U.S. Naval War Code,
article 7, forbids it altogether, whereas as late as 1898, during the
war with Spain in consequence of the Cuban insurrection, two American
men-of-war made use of the Spanish flag (see Perels, p. 183). And during
the war between Turkey and Russia, in 1877, Russian men-of-war in the
Black Sea made use of the Italian flag (see Martens, II. § 103, p. 566).
The question of the permissibility of the use of a neutral or enemy flag
is answered in the affirmative, among others, by Ortolan, II. p. 29;
Fiore, III. No. 1340; Perels, § 35, p. 183; Pillet, p. 116; Bonfils, No.
1274; Calvo, IV. 2106; Hall, § 187. See also Pillet in <i>R.G.</i> V. (1898),
pp. 444-451. But see the arguments against the use of a false flag in
Pradier-Fodéré, VI. No. 2760.</p></div>

<p>Vattel (III. § 178) relates the following case of
perfidy: In 1755, during war between Great Britain
and France, a British man-of-war appeared off Calais,
made signals of distress for the purpose of soliciting
French vessels to approach to her succour, and seized
a sloop and some sailors who came to bring her help.
Vattel is himself not certain whether this case is a fact
or fiction. But be that as it may, there is no doubt
that, if the case be true, it is an example of perfidy,
which is not allowed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

Europe<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> of requisitions or contributions imposed by
naval forces upon enemy coast towns. The question
whether or not such requisitions and contributions
would be lawful became of interest through an article
on naval warfare of the future, published in 1882 by
the French Admiral Aube in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>
(vol. 50, p. 331). Aube pointed out that one of the tasks
of the fleet in sea warfare of the future would be to
attack and destroy by bombardment fortified and unfortified
military and commercial enemy coast towns,
or at least to compel them mercilessly to requisitions
and contributions. As during the British naval
man&oelig;uvres of 1888 and 1889 imaginary contributions
were imposed upon several coast towns, Hall (§ 140*) took
into consideration the question under what conditions
requisitions and contributions would be lawful in sea
warfare. He concluded, after careful consideration
and starting from the principles regarding requisitions
and contributions in land warfare, that such requisitions
and contributions may be levied, provided a force is
landed which actually takes possession of the respective
coast town and establishes itself there, although only
temporarily, until the imposed requisitions and contributions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
have been complied with; that, however,
no requisitions or contributions could be demanded by
a single message sent on shore under threatened penalty
of bombardment in case of refusal. There is no doubt
that Hall's arguments are, logically, correct; but it
was not at all certain that the naval Powers would
adopt them, since neither the Institute of International
Law nor the U.S. Naval War Code had done so.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> The
Second Hague Peace Conference has now settled the
matter through the Convention (IX.) concerning bombardment
by naval forces in time of war which
amongst its thirteen articles includes two&mdash;3 and 4&mdash;dealing
with requisitions and contributions. This
Convention has been signed, although with some
reservations, by all the Powers represented at the

 below, § <a href="#There_is_no_doubt_whatever213">213</a>, p. 267. U.S. Naval War Code, article 4, allows
"reasonable" requisitions, but no contributions since "ransom" is not
allowed.</p></div>

<p>According to article 3 undefended ports, towns,
villages, dwellings, or other buildings may be bombarded
by a naval force, if the local authorities, on a
formal summons being made to them, decline to comply
with requisitions for provisions or supplies <i>necessary</i>
for the <i>immediate</i> use of the naval force concerned.
These requisitions must be proportional to the resources
of the place; they can only be demanded by
the commander of the naval force concerned; they
must be paid for in cash, and, if this is not possible for
want of sufficient ready money, their receipt must be
acknowledged.</p>

<p>As regards contributions, Convention IX. does not
directly forbid the demand for them, but article 4<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
expressly forbids bombardment of undefended places by
a naval force on account of non-payment of money
contributions; in practice, therefore, the demand for

<p>§ 213. <a name="There_is_no_doubt_whatever213" id="There_is_no_doubt_whatever213"></a>There is no doubt whatever that enemy
coast towns which are defended may be bombarded
by naval forces, acting either independently or in
co-operation with a besieging army. But before the
Second Peace Conference of 1907 the question was not
settled as to whether or not <i>open and undefended</i> coast
places might be bombarded by naval forces. The
Institute of International Law in 1895, at its meeting
at Cambridge, appointed a committee to investigate
the matter. The report<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> of this committee, drafted
by Professor Holland with the approval of the Dutch
General Den Beer Portugael, and presented in 1896
at the meeting at Venice,<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> is of such interest that it is
advisable to reproduce here a translation of the following
chief parts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">When the Prince de Joinville recommended in 1844, in case
of war, the devastation of the great commercial towns of England,
the Duke of Wellington wrote:&mdash;"What but the inordinate
desire of popularity could have induced a man in his station to
write and publish such a production, an invitation and provocation
to war, to be carried on in a manner such as has been
disclaimed by the civilised portions of mankind?" (Raikes,
<i>Correspondence</i>, p. 367). The opinion of the Prince de Joinville
has been taken up by Admiral Aube in an article which appeared
in the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> in 1882. After having
remarked that the ultimate object of war is to inflict the greatest
possible damage to the enemy and that "La richesse est le nerf
de la guerre," he goes on as follows:&mdash;"Tout ce qui frappe
l'ennemi dans sa richesse devient non seulement légitime, mais
s'impose comme obligatoire. Il faut donc s'attendre à voir les
flottes cuirassées, maîtresses de la mer, tourner leur puissance
d'attaque et déstruction, à défaut d'adversaires se dérobant à
leurs coups, contre toutes les villes du littoral, fortifiées ou non,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
pacifiques ou guerrières, les incendier, les ruiner, et tout au
moins les rançonner sans merci. Cela s'est fait autrefois; cela
ne se fait plus; cela se fera encore: Strasbourg et Péronne en
sont garants...."</p>

<p>The discussion was opened again in 1888, on the occasion
of man&oelig;uvres executed by the British Fleet, the enemy part of
which feigned to hold to ransom, under the threat of bombardment,
great commercial towns, such as Liverpool, and to cause
unnecessary devastation to pleasure towns and bathing-places,
such as Folkestone, through throwing bombs. One of your
reporters observed in a series of letters addressed to the <i>Times</i>
that such acts are contrary to the rules of International Law as
well as to the practice of the present century. He maintained
that bombardment of an open town ought to be allowed only for
the purpose of obtaining requisitions in kind necessary for the
enemy fleet and contributions instead of requisitions, further
by the way of reprisal, and in case the town defends itself
against occupation by enemy troops approaching on land....
Most of the admirals and naval officers of England who took
part in the lively correspondence which arose in the <i>Times</i> and
other journals during the months of August and September 1880
took up a contrary attitude....</p>

<p>On the basis of this report the Institute, at the
same meeting, adopted a body of rules regarding the
bombardment of open towns by naval forces, declaring
that the rules of the law of war concerning bombardment
are the same in the case of land warfare and sea
warfare. Of special interest are articles 4 and 5 of
these rules, which run as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">Article 4. In virtue of the general principles above, the
bombardment by a naval force of an open town, that is to say
one which is not defended by fortifications or by other means
of attack or of resistance for immediate defence, or by detached
forts situated in proximity, for example of the maximum distance
of from four to ten kilometres, is inadmissible except in the
following cases:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(1) For the purpose of obtaining by requisitions or contributions
what is necessary for the fleet. These requisitions
or contributions must in every case remain within the limits
prescribed by articles 56 and 58 of the Manual of the Institute.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(2) For the purpose of destroying sheds, military erections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
depôts of war munitions, or of war vessels in a port. Further,
an open town which defends itself against the entrance of troops
or of disembarked marines can be bombarded for the purpose
of protecting the disembarkation of the soldiers and of the
marines, if the open town attempts to prevent it, and as an
auxiliary measure of war to facilitate the result made by the
troops and the disembarked marines, if the town defends itself.
Bombardments of which the object is only to exact a ransom are
specially forbidden, and, with the stronger reason, those which
are intended only to bring about the submission of the country
by the destruction, for which there is no other motive, of the
peaceful inhabitants or of their property.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Article 5. An open town cannot be exposed to a bombardment
for the only reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>a</i>) That it is the capital of the State or the seat of the
Government (but naturally these circumstances do not guarantee
it in any way against a bombardment).</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>b</i>) That it is actually occupied by troops, or that it is
ordinarily the garrison of troops of different arms intended to
join the army in time of war.</p>

<p>The First Peace Conference did not settle the
matter, but expressed the desire "that the proposal to
settle the question of bombardment of ports, towns,
and villages by a naval force may be referred to a subsequent
Conference for consideration." The Second
Peace Conference, however, by Convention IX.&mdash;see
above, § <a href="#No_case_has_to_my_knowledge212">212</a>, p. 265&mdash;has provided detailed rules concerning
all the points in question, and the following
is now the law concerning bombardment by naval
forces:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(1) The bombardment of undefended ports, towns,
villages, dwellings, or other buildings is under all
circumstances and conditions prohibited (article 1). To
define the term "undefended," article 1 expressly enacts
that "a place cannot be bombarded solely because
automatic submarine contact mines are anchored off
the harbour," but Great Britain, France, Germany,
and Japan entered a reservation against this, since
they correctly consider such a place to be "defended."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">(2) Although undefended places themselves are
exempt, nevertheless military works, military or naval
establishments, depôts of arms or war material, workshops
or plant which could be utilised for the needs of
the hostile fleet or army, and men-of-war in the harbour
of undefended places may be bombarded. And no responsibility
is incurred for any unavoidable damage
caused thereby to the undefended place or its inhabitants.
As a rule, however, the commander must,
before resorting to bombardment of these works, ships,
and the like, give warning to the local authorities so
that they can destroy the works and vessels themselves.
Only if, for military reasons, immediate action
is necessary and no delay can be allowed to the enemy,
may bombardment be resorted to without previous
warning, the commander being compelled to take all due
measures in order that the undefended place itself may
suffer as little harm as possible (article 2).</p>

<p>The first case in which naval forces acted according
to these rules occurred during the Turco-Italian war.
On February 25, 1912, Admiral Faravelli, the commander
of an Italian squadron, surprised, at dawn, the
Turkish gunboat <i>Awni-Illa</i> and a torpedo-boat in the
port of Beirut. These vessels were called upon to surrender,
they were given until nine o'clock a.m. to
comply with the demand, and the demand was communicated
to the Governor and the Consular authorities.
At nine o'clock the Turkish vessels were again,
by signal, summoned to surrender, and as no reply was
received, they were fired at and destroyed, but not
without first having vigorously answered the fire of the
Italians. Shells missing the vessels and bursting on
the quay killed and wounded a number of individuals
and damaged several buildings. The Turkish Government
protested against this procedure as a violation of
Convention IX. of the Second Peace Conference, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
provided the official report of Admiral Faravelli
corresponds with the facts, the Turkish protest is
unfounded.</p>

<p>(3) In case undefended places do not comply with
legitimate requisitions, they likewise may be bombarded;
see details above, § <a href="#No_case_has_to_my_knowledge212">212</a>.</p>

<p>(4) In case of bombardments, all necessary steps
must be taken to spare buildings devoted to public
worship, art, science, or charitable purposes; historical
monuments; hospitals, and places where the sick or
wounded are collected, provided they are not at the
time used for military purposes. To enable the attacking
force to carry out this injunction, the privileged
buildings, monuments, and places must be indicated
by visible signs, which shall consist of large stiff rectangular
panels, divided diagonally into two coloured
triangular portions, the upper portion black, the
lower portion white (article 5). Unless military
exigencies render it impossible the commander of an
attacking naval force must, before commencing the
bombardment, do all in his power to warn the authorities
(article 6).</p>

<p>(5) The giving over to pillage of a town or place,
even when taken by assault, is forbidden (article 7).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

the following five rules:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(1) Le câble sousmarin reliant deux territoires neutres est

des belligérants ne peut en aucun cas être coupé dans la mer
territoriale ou dans les eaux neutralisées dépendant d'un territoire
neutre. En haute mer, ce câble ne peut être coupé que s'il y a
blocus effectif et dans les limites de la ligne du blocus, sauf
rétablissement du câble dans le plus bref délai possible. Le
câble peut toujours être coupé sur le territoire et dans la mer
territoriale dépendant d'un territoire ennemi jusqu'à d'une

des belligérants.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(5) En ce qui concerne l'application des règles précédentes,
il n'y a de différence à établir ni entre les câbles d'État et les

<p>§ 215. Although the outbreak of war between
States as a rule brings non-hostile intercourse to an
end, necessity of circumstances, convenience, humanity,
and other factors call, or may call, some kinds of
non-hostile relations of belligerents into existence.
And it is a universally recognised principle of International
Law that, where such relations arise, belligerents
must carry them out in good faith. <i>Fides
etiam hosti servanda</i> is a rule which was adhered to in
antiquity, when no International Law in the modern
sense of the term existed. But it had then a religious
and moral sanction only. Since in modern times war
is not a condition of anarchy and lawlessness between
belligerents, but a contention in many respects regulated,
restricted, and modified by law, it is obvious
that, where non-hostile relations between belligerents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
occur, they are protected by law. <i>Fides etiam hosti servanda</i>
is, therefore, a principle which nowadays enjoys
as well a legal as a religious and moral sanction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Different kinds of Non-hostile Relations.</p></div>

<p>§ 216. As through the outbreak of war all diplomatic
intercourse and other non-hostile relations come to an
end, it is obvious that non-hostile relations between
belligerents must originate either from special rules of
International Law or from special agreements between
the belligerents.</p>

<p>No special rules of International Law which demanded
non-hostile relations between belligerents
existed in former times, but of late a few rules of this
kind have arisen. Thus, for instance, release on
parole<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> of prisoners of war creates an obligation on
the part of the enemy not to re-admit the individuals
concerned into the forces while the war lasts. And, to
give another example, by article 4 of the Geneva Convention
of 1906, and article 14 of the Hague Regulations&mdash;see
also article 17 of Convention X. of the Second
Peace Conference&mdash;it is the duty of either belligerent to
return to the enemy, by his prisoner-of-war bureau, all
objects of personal use, letters, jewellery, and the like
found on the battlefield or left by those who died in
hospital.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Non-hostile relations of this kind, however,
need not be considered in this chapter, since they have
already been discussed on several previous pages.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_429_429" id="Footnote_429_429"></a><a href="#FNanchor_429_429"><span class="label">[429]</span></a> See

 above, § <a href="#Private_enemy_property144">144</a>.</p></div>

<p>Non-hostile relations originating from special agreements
of belligerents, so-called <i>commercia belli</i>, may
either be concluded in time of peace for the purpose
of creating certain non-hostile relations between the
parties in case war breaks out, or they may be
concluded during the actual time of war. Such
non-hostile relations are created through passports,
safe-conducts, safeguards, flags of truce, cartels, capitulations,
and armistices. Non-hostile relations can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
also be created by peace negotiations.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> Each of these
non-hostile relations must be discussed separately.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_431_431" id="Footnote_431_431"></a><a href="#FNanchor_431_431"><span class="label">[431]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Licences
to Trade.</p></div>

<p>§ 217. <a name="Several217" id="Several217"></a>Several writers<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> speak of non-hostile relations
between belligerents created by licences to
trade granted by a belligerent to enemy subjects
either within certain limits or generally. It has been
explained above, in § <a href="#Following101">101</a>, that it is for Municipal Law
to determine whether or not through the outbreak of
war all trade and the like is prohibited between the
subjects of belligerents. If the Municipal Law of one
or both belligerents does contain such a prohibition, it
is of course within the discretion of one or both of them
to grant exceptional licences to trade to their own or
the other belligerent's subjects, and such licences
naturally include certain privileges. Thus, for instance,
if a belligerent allows enemy subjects to trade
with his own subjects, enemy merchantmen engaged in
such trade are exempt from capture and appropriation
by the grantor. Yet it is not International Law which
creates this exemption, but the very licence to trade
granted by the belligerent and revocable at any
moment; and no non-hostile international relations
between the belligerents themselves originate from
such licences. The matter would be different if, either
in time of peace for the time of war, or, during war, the
belligerents agreed to allow certain trade between their
subjects; but non-hostile relations originating from
such an agreement would not be relations arising from
a licence to trade, but from a cartel.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>§ 218. <a name="Belligerents_on_occasions218" id="Belligerents_on_occasions218"></a>Belligerents on occasions arrange between
themselves that passports and safe-conducts shall be
given to certain of each other's subjects. Passports
are written permissions given by a belligerent to enemy
subjects, or others, allowing them to travel within that
belligerent's territory or enemy territory occupied by
him. Safe-conducts are written permissions given by
a belligerent to enemy subjects, or others, allowing
them to proceed to a particular place for a defined
object, for instance, to a besieged town for conducting
certain negotiations; but safe-conducts may also be
given for goods, and they then comprise permission
to carry such goods without molestation to a certain
place. Passports as well as safe-conducts make the
grantee inviolable so long and in so far as he complies
with the conditions specially imposed upon him or
made necessary by the circumstances of the special
case. Passports and safe-conducts are not transferable,
and they may be granted to enemy subjects for a
limited or an unlimited period; in the former case
their validity ceases with the expiration of the period.
Both may be withdrawn, not only when the grantee
abuses the protection, but also for military expediency.
It must, however, be specially observed that passports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
and safe-conducts are only a matter of International
Law when the granting of them has been arranged between
the belligerents or their responsible commanders,
or between belligerents and neutral Powers. If they
are granted without such an arrangement, unilaterally
on the part of one of the belligerents, they fall outside
the scope of International Law.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

between the belligerents to be granted, on the one hand, and, on the
other, such as are granted unilaterally, would seem to be necessary,
although it is not generally made.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Safeguards.</p></div>

<p>§ 219. <a name="Belligerents_on_occasions219" id="Belligerents_on_occasions219"></a>Belligerents on occasions arrange between
themselves that they shall grant protection to certain
of each other's subjects or property against their own
forces in the form of safeguards, of which there are
two kinds. One consists in a written order given to
an enemy subject or left with enemy property and
addressed to the commander of armed forces of the
grantor, in which the former is charged with the protection
of the respective individual or property, and
by which both become inviolable. The other kind of
safeguard is given by detailing one or more soldiers
to accompany enemy subjects or to guard the spot
where certain enemy property is, for the purpose of
protection. Soldiers on this duty are inviolable on
the part of the other belligerent; they must neither
be attacked nor made prisoners, and they must, on falling
into the hands of the enemy, be fed, well kept, and
eventually safely sent back to their corps. As in the
case of passports and safe-conducts, it must be specially
observed that safeguards are only a matter of International
Law when the granting of them has been
arranged by the belligerents, and not otherwise;
except in the case of the safeguards mentioned by
article 8, No. 2, of the Geneva Convention of 1906,
who, according to articles 9 and 12 of that Convention,
are inviolable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 220. <a name="Al220" id="Al220"></a>Although the outbreak of war brings all
negotiations between belligerents to an end, and although
no negotiations are as a rule conducted during
war, certain circumstances and conditions make it
necessary or convenient for the armed forces of belligerents
to enter into negotiations with each other for
various purposes. Since time immemorial a white flag
has been used as a symbol by an armed force wishing
to negotiate with the enemy, and always and everywhere
it has been considered a duty of the enemy to
respect this symbol. In land warfare the flag of truce
is made use of in the following manner.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> An individual&mdash;soldier
or civilian&mdash;charged by his force with the
task of negotiating with the enemy, approaches the
latter either carrying the flag himself, or accompanied
by a flag-bearer and, often, also by a drummer, a
bugler, or a trumpeter, and an interpreter. In sea
warfare the individual charged with the task of negotiating
approaches the enemy in a boat flying the white
flag. The Hague Regulations have now by articles
32 to 34 enacted most of the customary rules of International
Law regarding flags of truce without adding
any new rule. These rules are the same for land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
warfare as for sea warfare, although their validity for
land warfare is now grounded on the Hague Regulations,
whereas their validity for sea warfare is still
based on custom only.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Treatment of Unadmitted Flag-bearers.</p></div>

<p>§ 221. As a commander of an armed force is not,
according to article 33 of the Hague Regulations, compelled
to receive a bearer of a flag of truce, a flag-bearer
who makes his appearance may at once be signalled
to withdraw. Yet even then he is inviolable from the
time he displays the flag to the end of the time necessary
for withdrawal. During this time he may neither be
intentionally attacked nor made prisoner. However,
an armed force in battle is not obliged to stop its military
operations on account of the approach of an enemy
flag-bearer who has been signalled to withdraw. Although
the latter may not be fired upon intentionally,
should he be wounded or killed accidentally, during
the battle, no responsibility or moral blame would rest
upon the belligerent concerned. In former times the
commander of an armed force could inform the enemy
that, within a certain defined or indefinite period, he
would under no circumstances or conditions receive a
flag-bearer; if, in spite of such notice, a flag-bearer
approached, he did not enjoy any privilege, and he could
be attacked and made prisoner like any other member
of the enemy forces. But this rule is now obsolete, and
its place is taken by the rule that a commander must
never, except in a case of reprisals, declare beforehand,
even only for a specified period, that he will not receive
a bearer of a flag of truce.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

subject at the First Peace Conference; see Martens, <i>N.R.G.</i> 2nd Ser.
XXVI. p. 465; and <i>Land Warfare</i>, § 234.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Treatment
of
Admitted
Flag-bearers.</p></div>

<p>§ 222. <a name="Bearers_of_flags222" id="Bearers_of_flags222"></a>Bearers of flags of truce and their parties,
when admitted by the other side, must be granted the
privilege of inviolability. They may neither be attacked
nor taken prisoners, and they must be allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
return safely in due time to their own lines. On the
other hand, the forces admitting enemy flag-bearers
need not allow them to acquire information about the
receiving forces and to carry it back to their own corps.
Flag-bearers and their parties may, therefore, be blindfolded
by the receiving forces, or be conducted by
roundabout ways, or be prevented from entering into
communication with individuals other than those who
confer officially with them, and they may even temporarily
be prevented from returning till a certain
military operation of which they have obtained information
is carried out. Article 33 of the Hague Regulations
specifically enacts that a commander to whom a
flag of truce is sent "may take all steps necessary to
prevent the envoy taking advantage of his mission to
obtain information." Bearers of flags of truce are
not, however, prevented from reporting to their corps
any information they have gained by observation in
passing through the enemy lines and in communicating
with enemy individuals. But they are not allowed to
sketch maps of defences and positions, to gather information
secretly and surreptitiously, to provoke or to
commit treacherous acts, and the like. If nevertheless
they do any of these acts, they may be court-martialed.
Articles 33 and 34 of the Hague Regulations specifically
enact that a flag-bearer may temporarily be detained
in case he abuses his mission for the purpose of obtaining
information, and that he loses all privileges of inviolability
"if it is proved beyond doubt that he has
taken advantage of his privileged position to provoke
or commit an act of treachery." Bearers of white flags
and their party, who approach the enemy and are
received, must carry<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> some authorisation with them to
show that they are charged with the task of entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
into negotiations (article 32), otherwise they may be
detained as prisoners, since it is his mission and not the
white flag itself which protects the flag-bearer. This
mission protects every one who is charged with it,
notwithstanding his position in his corps and his
status as a civilian or a soldier, but it does not protect
a deserter. The latter may be detained, court-martialed,
and punished, notice being given to his
principal of the reason of punishment.<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Abuse of Flag of Truce.</p></div>

<p>§ 223. Abuse of his mission by an authorised flag-bearer
must be distinguished from an abuse of the flag
of truce itself. Such abuse is possible in two different
forms:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The force which sends an authorised flag-bearer
to the enemy has to take up a corresponding attitude;
the ranks which the flag-bearer leaves being obliged to
halt and to cease fire. Now it constitutes an abuse of
the flag of truce if such attitude corresponding with
the sending of a flag of truce is intentionally not taken
up by the sending force. The case is even worse when
a flag-bearer is intentionally sent on a feigned mission
in order that military operations may be carried out by
the sender under the protection due from the enemy to
the flag-bearer and his party.</p>

<p>(2) The second form of a possible abuse appears in
the case in which a white flag is made use of for the
purpose of making the enemy believe that a flag of truce
is about to be sent, although it is not sent, and of
carrying out operations under the protection granted
by the enemy to this pretended flag of truce.</p>

<p>It need hardly be specially mentioned that both
forms of abuse are gross perfidy and may be met with
reprisals, or with punishment of the offenders in case
they fall into the hands of the enemy. The following
case of abuse is related by Sir Sherston Baker in Halleck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
(II. p. 315):&mdash;"On July 12, 1882, while the British
fleet was lying off Alexandria, in support of the authority
of the Khedive of Egypt, and the rebels under Arabi
Pasha were being driven to great straits, a rebel boat,
carrying a white flag of truce, was observed approaching
H.M.S. <i>Invincible</i> from the harbour, whereupon
H.M. ships <i>Temeraire</i> and <i>Inflexible</i>, which had just
commenced firing, were ordered to suspend fire. So
soon as the firing ceased, the boat, instead of going to
the <i>Invincible</i>, returned to the harbour. A flag of
truce was simultaneously hoisted by the rebels on the
Ras-el-Tin fort. These deceits gave the rebels time to
leave the works and to retire through the town, abandoning
the forts, and withdrawing the whole of their
garrison under the flag of truce."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Character
and
Purpose of
Capitulations.</p></div>

<p>§ 226. Capitulations are conventions between armed
forces of belligerents stipulating the terms of surrender
of fortresses and other defended places, or of men-of-war,
or of troops. It is, therefore, necessary to distinguish
between a <i>simple</i> and a <i>stipulated</i> surrender. If
one or more soldiers lay down their arms and surrender,
or if a fortress or a man-of-war surrenders without
making any terms whatever, there is no capitulation,
for capitulation is a convention stipulating the terms
of surrender.</p>

<p>Capitulations are military conventions only and
exclusively; they must not, therefore, contain arrangements
other than those of a local and military character
concerning the surrendering forces, places, or ships.
If they do contain such arrangements, the latter are not
valid, unless they are ratified by the political authorities
of both belligerents.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> The surrender of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
place or force may, of course, be arranged by some
convention containing other than military stipulations,
but then such surrender would not originate from a
capitulation. And just as is their character, so the
purpose of capitulations is merely military&mdash;namely,
the abandonment of a hopeless struggle and resistance
which would only involve useless loss of life on the
part of a hopelessly beset force. Therefore, whatever
may be the indirect consequences of a certain capitulation,
its direct consequences have nothing to do with
the war at large, but are local only and concern the
surrendering force exclusively.</p>

Lord William Bentinck to Genoa, in 1814, regarding its independence,
which was disowned by the British Government. Phillimore himself
disapproves of the attitude of Great Britain, and so do some foreign
publicists, as, for instance, Despagnet (No. 562); but the rule that
capitulations are military conventions, and that, therefore, such
stipulations are not valid as are not of a local military character, is
indubitable.</p></div>

<p>§ 227. If special conditions are not agreed upon
in a capitulation, it is concluded under the obvious
condition that the surrendering force become prisoners
of war, and that all war material and other public
property in their possession or within the surrendering
place or ship are surrendered in the condition they
were at the time when the signature was given to the
capitulation. Nothing prevents a force fearing surrender
from destroying their provisions, munitions, their arms
and other instruments of war which, when falling into
the hands of the enemy, would be useful to him. Again,
nothing prevents a commander, even after negotiations
regarding surrender have begun, from destroying such
articles. But when once a capitulation has been signed,<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
such destruction is no longer lawful, and, if carried out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
constitutes perfidy which may be punished by the
other party as a war crime.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_444_444" id="Footnote_444_444"></a><a href="#FNanchor_444_444"><span class="label">[444]</span></a> When, during the Russo-Japanese War, in January 1905,
General Stoessel, the Commander of Port Arthur, had fortifications blown
up and vessels sunk, during negotiations for surrender, but before the
capitulation was signed, the Press undeservedly accused him of perfidy.
U.S. Naval War Code, article 52, enacted the right principle, that
"<i>after agreeing upon or signing</i> a capitulation, the capitulator must
neither injure nor destroy the vessels, property, or stores in his
possession that he is to deliver up, unless the right to do so is
expressly reserved to him in the agreement or capitulation."</p></div>

<p>But special conditions may be agreed upon between
the forces concerned, and they must then be faithfully
adhered to by both parties. The only rule which
article 35 of the Hague Regulations enacts regarding
capitulations is that the latter must be in accordance
with the demands of military honour, and that, when
once settled, they must be scrupulously observed. It
is instructive to give some instances of possible conditions:&mdash;A
condition of a capitulation may be the
provision that the convention shall be valid only if
within a certain period relief troops are not approaching.
Provision may, further, be made that the surrendering
forces shall not in every detail be treated
like ordinary prisoners of war. Thus it may be stipulated
that the officers or even the soldiers shall be released
on parole, that officers remaining prisoners shall
retain their swords. Whether or not a belligerent will
grant or even offer such specially favourable conditions
depends upon the importance of the force, place, or
ship to be surrendered, and upon the bravery of the
surrendering force. There are even instances of capitulations
which stipulated that the surrendering forces
should leave the place with full honours, carrying their
arms and baggage away and joining their own army
unmolested by the enemy through whose lines they had
to march.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_445_445" id="Footnote_445_445"></a><a href="#FNanchor_445_445"><span class="label">[445]</span></a> During the Franco-German War the Germans granted these most
favourable conditions to the French forces that surrendered Belfort on
February 15, 1871.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Form of
Capitulations.</p></div>

<p>§ 228. No rule of International Law exists regarding
the form of capitulations, which may, therefore, be
concluded either orally or in writing. But they are
usually concluded in writing. Negotiations for surrender,
from whichever side they emanate, are usually
sent under a flag of truce, but a force which is ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to surrender without special conditions can indicate
their intention by hoisting a white flag as a signal that
they abandon all and every resistance. The question
whether the enemy must at once cease firing and accept
the surrender, is to be answered in the affirmative,
provided he is certain that the white flag was hoisted
by order or with the authority of the commander of
the respective force. As, however, such hoisting may
well have taken place without the authority of the
commander and may, therefore, be disowned by the
latter, no duty exists for the enemy to cease his attack
until he is convinced that the white flag really indicates
the intention of the commander to surrender.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Competence
to
conclude
Capitulations.</p></div>

<p>§ 229. The competence to conclude capitulations is
vested in the commanders of the forces opposing each
other. Capitulations entered into by unauthorised
subordinate officers may, therefore, be disowned by
the commander concerned without breach of faith.
As regards special conditions of capitulations, it must
be particularly noted that the competence of a commander
to grant them is limited<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> to those the fulfilment
of which depends entirely upon the forces under
his command. If he grants conditions against his
instructions, his superiors may disown such conditions.
And the same is valid if he grants conditions the fulfilment
of which depends upon forces other than his own
and upon superior officers. The capitulation in El
Arish<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> on January 24, 1800, arranged between the
French General Kléber and the Turkish Grand Vizier,
and approved by the British Admiral, Sir Sidney Smith,
presents an illustrative example of this rule. As
General Kléber, who was commanding the French army
in Egypt, thought that he could not remain in Egypt,
he proposed surrender under the condition that his
army should be safely transported to France, carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
away their arms and baggage. The Grand Vizier
accepted these conditions. The British Admiral, Sir
Sidney Smith, who approved of these conditions, was
the local commander on the coast of Egypt, but was
an officer inferior to Lord Keith, the commander of
the British Mediterranean fleet. The latter had, on
January 8, 1800, received secret orders, dated December
15, 1799, from the British Government instructing him
not to agree to any capitulation which stipulated the
free return of Kléber's army to France. Sir Sidney
Smith did not, however, receive instructions based on
these orders until February 22, 1800, and, therefore,
when he approved of the capitulation of El Arish in
January, was not aware that he acted against orders
of the British Government.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Lord Keith, after having
received the above orders on January 8, 1800, wrote at
once to General Kléber, pointing out that he was not
allowed to grant the return of the French army to
France.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> On the other hand, the British Government,
after having been informed that Sir Sidney Smith
had approved of the return of the French army, sent,
on March 28, 1800, fresh orders<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> to Lord Keith, received
by him at the end of April, advising him, although
Sir Sidney Smith had exceeded his competence,
to allow the capitulation to be carried out and the French
army to be safely transported to France. Meanwhile,
however, circumstances had entirely changed. When
General Kléber had on March 17, 1800, received Lord
Keith's letter of January 8, he addressed a proclamation,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>
in which Lord Keith's letter was embodied, to his
troops asking them to prepare themselves for battle
and actually began hostilities again on March 20. He
was assassinated on June 14, and General Menou took
over the command, and it was the latter who received,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
on June 20, 1800, information of the changed attitude
of the British Government regarding the capitulation
of El Arish. Hostilities having been renewed as far
back as March, General Menou refused,<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> on his part, to
consent to the carrying out of the capitulation, and continued
hostilities.</p>

<p>It is obvious that Sir Sidney Smith, in approving
the capitulation, granted a condition which did not
depend entirely upon himself and the forces under
him, but which depended upon Lord Keith and his
fleet. Lord Keith as well as the British Government
could have lawfully disowned this condition. That the
British Government did not do so, but was ready to
ratify Sir Sidney Smith's approval, was due to the
fact that it did not want to disavow the promises of
Sir Sidney Smith, who was not at the time aware of
the orders of his Government to Lord Keith. On the
other hand, the French Generals were not wrong in
resuming hostilities after having received Lord Keith's
first information, as thereby the capitulation fell to
the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Violation of Capitulations.</p></div>

<p>§ 230. That capitulations must be scrupulously
adhered to is an old customary rule, now enacted by
article 35 of the Hague Regulations. Any act contrary
to a capitulation would constitute an international
delinquency if ordered by the belligerent Government
concerned, and a war crime if committed without such
order. Such violation may be met with reprisals or
punishment of the offenders as war criminals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Character and Kinds of Armistices.</p></div>

<p>§ 231. Armistices or truces, in the wider sense of
the term, are all agreements between belligerent forces
for a temporary cessation of hostilities. They are in
no wise to be compared with peace, and ought not to
be called temporary peace, because the condition of
war remains between the belligerents themselves, and
between the belligerents and neutrals on all points
beyond the mere cessation of hostilities. In spite of
such cessation the right of visit and search over neutral
merchantmen therefore remains intact, as does likewise
the right to capture neutral vessels attempting to
break a blockade, and the right to seize contraband of
war. However, although all armistices are essentially
alike in so far as they consist of cessation of hostilities,
three different kinds must be distinguished&mdash;namely,
(1) suspensions of arms, (2) general armistices, and (3)
partial armistices.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> It must be emphasised that the
Hague Regulations deal with armistices in articles 36<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to 41 very incompletely, so that the gaps need filling up
from old customary rules.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_453_453" id="Footnote_453_453"></a><a href="#FNanchor_453_453"><span class="label">[453]</span></a> Although, as will be seen from the following sections, this
distinction is absolutely necessary, it is not made by several
publicists. Holland, <i>War</i>, No. 93, even says: "There is no difference
of meaning, according to British usage at least, between a 'truce,' an
'armistice,' and a 'suspension of arms.'" <i>Land Warfare</i>, § 256&mdash;see in
especial note (<i>a</i>)&mdash;accepts the distinction as indispensable.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Suspensions of Arms.</p></div>

<p>§ 232. Suspensions of arms, in contradistinction
to armistices in the narrower sense of the term, are
such cessations of hostilities as are agreed upon between
large or small military or naval forces for a
very short time and regarding momentary and local
military purposes only. Such purposes may be&mdash;collection
of the wounded; burial of the dead; negotiation
regarding surrender or evacuation of a defended
place, or regarding an armistice in the narrower sense
of the term; but may also be the creation of a possibility
for a commander to ask for and receive instructions
from a superior authority,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and the like. Suspensions
of arms have nothing to do with political
purposes, or with the war generally, since they are of
momentary and local importance only. They concern
exclusively those forces and that spot which are the
object of the suspension of arms. The Hague Regulations
do not specially mention suspensions of arms,
since article 37 speaks of local armistices only, apparently
comprising suspensions of arms among local
armistices.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_454_454" id="Footnote_454_454"></a><a href="#FNanchor_454_454"><span class="label">[454]</span></a> An instructive example of a suspension of arms for such
purposes is furnished by the Convention between the German forces
besieging Belfort and the French forces holding this fortress during the
Franco-German War, signed on February 13, 1871; see Martens, <i>N.R.G.</i>
XIX. p. 646.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>General Armistices.</p></div>

<p>§ 233. A general armistice is such a cessation of
hostilities as, in contradistinction to suspensions of
arms with their momentary and local military purposes,
is agreed upon between belligerents for the
whole of their forces and the whole region of war.
General armistices are always conventions of vital
political importance affecting the whole of the war.
They are as a rule, although not necessarily, concluded
for a political purpose. It may be that negotiations
of peace have ripened so far that the end of the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
is in sight and that, therefore, military operations
appear superfluous; or that the forces of either belligerent
are exhausted and need rest; or that the belligerents
have to face domestic difficulties, the settlement
of which is more pressing than the continuation of the
war; or any other political purpose. Thus article 2
of the general armistice agreed upon at the end of the
Franco-German War on January 28, 1871,<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> expressly
declared the purpose of the armistice to be the creation
of the possibility for the French Government to convoke
a Parliamentary Assembly which could determine
whether or not the war was to be continued or what
conditions of peace should be accepted.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_455_455" id="Footnote_455_455"></a><a href="#FNanchor_455_455"><span class="label">[455]</span></a> Martens, <i>N.R.G.</i> XIX. p. 626.</p></div>

<p>It is of importance to note that, for particular
reasons, small parts of the belligerent forces and small
parts of the theatre of war may be specially excluded
without detracting from the general character of the
armistice, provided the bulk of the forces and the
greater part of the region of war are included. Thus,
article 1 of the above-mentioned general armistice at
the end of the Franco-German war specially excluded
all military operations in the Départements du Doubs,
du Jura, de la Côte d'Or, and likewise the siege of
Belfort. It should also be mentioned that in the
practice of belligerents the terms "suspension of arms"
and "general armistice" are sometimes not sufficiently
distinguished, but are interchangeable. Thus, for instance,
the above-mentioned general armistice between
France and Germany is entitled "Convention entre
l'Allemagne et la France pour la suspension des hostilités, ..."
whereas the different articles of the
Convention always speak correctly of an armistice, and
whereas, further, an annexe to the Convention signed on
January 29 is entitled<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> "Annexe à la Convention
d'armistice."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_456_456" id="Footnote_456_456"></a><a href="#FNanchor_456_456"><span class="label">[456]</span></a> Martens, <i>N.R.G.</i> XIX. p. 636.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Partial
Armistices.</p></div>

<p>§ 234. Partial armistices are agreements for cessations
of hostilities which are not concluded by belligerents
for their whole forces and the whole region of
war, but do not merely serve, like suspensions of arms,
momentary and local military purposes. They are
armistices concluded by belligerents for a considerable
part of their forces and front; they are always
of political importance affecting the war in general;
and they are very often, although they need not be,
agreed upon for political purposes. Article 37 of
the Hague Regulations apparently includes partial
armistices together with suspensions of arms under the
term "local" armistices. A partial armistice may be
concluded for the military or the naval forces only;
for cessation of hostilities in the colonies only; for
cessation of hostilities between two of the belligerents in
case more than two are parties to the war, and the
like. But it is always a condition that a considerable
part of the forces and region of war must be included,
and that the purpose is not only a momentary one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Competence
to
conclude
Armistices.</p></div>

<p>§ 235. As regards the competence to conclude
armistices, a distinction is necessary between suspensions
of arms and general and partial armistices.</p>

<p>(1) Since the character and purpose of suspensions
of arms are military, local, and momentary only,
every commander is supposed to be competent to agree
upon a suspension of arms, and no ratification on the
part of superior officers or other authorities is required.
Even commanders of the smallest opposing detachments
may arrange a suspension of arms.</p>

<p>(2) On the other hand, since general armistices are of
vital political importance, only the belligerent Governments
themselves or their commanders-in-chief are
competent to conclude them, and ratification, whether
specially stipulated or not, is necessary. Should a
commander-in-chief conclude a general armistice which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
would not find ratification, hostilities may at once be
recommenced without breach of faith, it being a matter
of common knowledge that a commander-in-chief is not
authorised to agree upon exclusion of ratification, unless
he received special powers thereto.</p>

<p>(3) Partial armistices may be concluded by the
commanders-in-chief of the respective forces, and ratification
is not necessary, unless specially stipulated;
the commanders being responsible to their own Governments
in case they agree upon a partial armistice without
being specially authorised thereto.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Form of
Armistices.</p></div>

<p>§ 236. No legal rule exists regarding the form of
armistices, which may therefore be concluded either
orally or in writing. However, the importance of
general as well as partial armistices makes it advisable
to conclude them by signing written documents containing
all items which have been agreed upon. No
instance is known of a general or partial armistice of
modern times concluded otherwise than in writing.
But suspensions of arms are often only orally concluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Contents
of Armistices.</p></div>

<p>§ 237. That hostilities must cease is the obvious
content of all kinds of armistices. Usually, although
not at all necessarily, the parties embody special conditions
in the agreement instituting an armistice. If
and so far as this has not been done, the import of
armistices is for some parts much controverted. Everybody
agrees that belligerents during an armistice may,
outside the line where the forces face each other, do
everything and anything they like regarding defence
and preparation of offence; for instance, they may
manufacture and import munitions and guns, drill
recruits, build fortresses, concentrate or withdraw
troops. But no unanimity exists regarding such acts
as must be left undone or may be done within the very
line where the belligerent forces face each other. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
majority of writers, led by Vattel (III. § 245), maintain
that in the absence of special stipulations it is essentially
implied in an armistice that within such line no alteration
of the <i>status quo</i> shall take place which the other party,
were it not for the armistice, could by application of
force, for instance by a cannonade or by some other
means, prevent from taking place. These writers
consider it a breach of faith for a belligerent to make
such alterations under the protection of the armistice.
On the other hand, a small minority of writers, but led
by Grotius (III. c. 21, § 7) and Pufendorf (VIII. 7, § 7),
assert that cessation of hostilities and of further advance
only are essentially implied in an armistice; all other
acts, such as strengthening of positions by concentration
of more troops on the spot, erection and strengthening
of defences, repairing of breaches of besieged
fortresses, withdrawing of troops, making of fresh
batteries on the part of besiegers without advancing,
and the like, being allowed. As the Hague Regulations
do not mention the matter, the controversy still remains
unsettled. I believe the opinion of the minority
to be correct, since an armistice does not mean anything
else than a cessation of actual hostilities, and
it is for the parties who agree upon an armistice to
stipulate such special conditions as they think necessary
or convenient. This applies particularly to the other
controversial questions as to revictualling of besieged
places and as to intercourse, commercial and otherwise,
of the inhabitants of the region where actual
fighting was going on before the armistice. As regards
revictualling, it has been correctly maintained
that, if it were not allowed, the position of the besieged
forces would thereby be weakened by the action
of the armistice. But I cannot see why this should
be an argument to hold revictualling permissible. The
principle <i>vigilantibus jura sunt scripta</i> applies to armistices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
as well as to all other legal transactions. It is for
the parties to prepare such arrangements as really
suit their needs and wants. Thus, during the Franco-German
War an armistice for twenty-five days proposed
in November 1870 fell to the ground on the Germans
refusing to grant the revictualling of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> It seems
to be the intention of the Hague Regulations that the
parties should always stipulate those special conditions
which they need. Article 39 pronounces this intention
regarding intercourse, commercial and otherwise, during
armistices, by the following words:&mdash;"It is for the
contracting parties to settle in the terms of the armistice
what communications may be held within the theatre
of war with the population and with each other."</p>

revictualling during an armistice is discussed at some length, and the
opinions of many publicists from Grotius to our own days are quoted.</p></div>

<p>It must be specially mentioned that for the purpose
of preventing the outbreak of hostilities during an
armistice it is usual to agree upon so-called lines of
demarcation<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>&mdash;that is, a small neutral zone between
the forces facing each other which must not be entered
by members of either force. But such lines of demarcation
do not exist, if they are not specially stipulated
by the armistice concerned.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_458_458" id="Footnote_458_458"></a><a href="#FNanchor_458_458"><span class="label">[458]</span></a> See Pradier-Fodéré, VII. No. 2901.</p></div>

<p>§ 238. <a name="In_case_the_contrary238" id="In_case_the_contrary238"></a>In case the contrary is not stipulated, an
armistice commences the very moment the agreement
upon it is complete. But often the parties stipulate in
the agreement the time from which the armistice shall
begin. If this is done in so detailed a manner that
the very hour of the commencement is mentioned,
no cause for controversy is given. But sometimes
the parties fix only the date by stipulating that the
armistice shall last from one certain day to another,
<i>e.g.</i> from June 15 to July 15. In such case the actual
commencement is controversial. Most publicists maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
that in such case the armistice begins at 12 o'clock
of the night between the 14th and the 15th of June,
but Grotius (III. c. 21, § 4) maintains that it begins at
12 o'clock of the night between the 15th and the 16th
of June.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> Therefore, to avoid difficulties, agreements
concerning armistices ought always to stipulate whether
the first day is to be included in the armistice. Be that
as it may, when the forces included in an armistice are
dispersed over a very large area, the parties very often
stipulate different dates of commencement for the
different parts of the front, because it is not possible to
announce the armistice at once to all the forces included.
Thus, for instance, article 1 of the general armistice at
the end of the Franco-German War<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> stipulated its immediate
commencement for the forces in and around
Paris, but that with regard to the other forces its commencement
should be delayed three days. Article 38
of the Hague Regulations enacts that an armistice
must be notified officially and in good time to the
competent authorities and the troops, and that hostilities
are suspended immediately after the ratification or at a
fixed date, as the case may be.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_459_459" id="Footnote_459_459"></a><a href="#FNanchor_459_459"><span class="label">[459]</span></a> See Pradier-Fodéré, VII. No. 2897. The controversy occurs

<p>It sometimes happens that hostilities are carried
on after the commencement of an armistice by forces
which did not know of its commencement. In such
cases the <i>status quo</i> at the date of the commencement
of armistice has to be re-established so far as possible,
prisoners made and enemy vessels seized being liberated,
capitulations annulled, places occupied evacuated, and
the like; but the parties may, of course, stipulate the
contrary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Violation
of Armistices.</p></div>

<p>§ 239. Any violation of armistices is prohibited,
and, if ordered by the Governments concerned, constitutes
an international delinquency. In case an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
armistice is violated by members of the forces on their
own account, the individuals concerned may be punished
by the other party in case they fall into its hands. Be
that as it may, the question must be answered, what
general attitude is to be taken by one party, if the other
violates the armistice? No unanimity regarding this
point exists among the writers on International Law,
many<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> asserting that in case of violation the other
party may at once, without giving notice, re-open
hostilities; others<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> maintaining that such party may not
do this, but has only the right to denounce the armistice.
The Hague Regulations endeavour to settle the controversy,
article 40 enacting that any serious violation
of an armistice by one of the parties gives the other the
right to denounce it, and even, in case of urgency, to
recommence hostilities at once. Three rules may be
formulated from this&mdash;(1) violations which are not
serious do not even give the right to denounce an
armistice; (2) serious violations do as a rule empower
the other party to denounce only the armistice, but
not to recommence hostilities at once without notice;
(3) only in case of urgency is a party justified in recommencing
hostilities without notice, when the other
party has broken an armistice. But since the terms
"serious violation" and "urgency" lack precise definition,
it is practically left to the discretion of the
injured party.</p>

<p>It must be specially observed that violation of an
armistice committed by private individuals acting on
their own initiative is to be distinguished from violation
by members of the armed forces. In the former
case the injured party has, according to article 41 of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
the Hague Regulations, only the right of demanding
punishment of the offenders, and, if necessary, indemnity
for losses sustained.</p>

<p>§ 240. <a name="In_case_an_armistice240" id="In_case_an_armistice240"></a>In case an armistice has been concluded for
an indefinite period, the parties having made no
stipulations regarding notice to recommence hostilities,
notice may be given at any time, and hostilities recommenced
at once after notification. In most cases,
however, armistices are agreed upon for a definite
period, and then they expire with such period without
special notice, unless notification has been expressly
stipulated. If, in case of an armistice for a definite
period, the exact hour of the termination has not been
agreed upon, but only the date, the armistice terminates
at twelve o'clock midnight of such date. In case an
armistice has been arranged to last from one certain
day to another, <i>e.g.</i> from June 15 to July 15, it is again<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
controversial whether July 15 is excluded or included.
An armistice may, lastly, be concluded under a resolutive
condition, in which case the occurrence of the
condition brings the armistice to an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Legitimate and Illegitimate Warfare.</p></div>

<p>§ 241. Since war is not a condition of anarchy and
lawlessness, International Law requires that belligerents
shall comply with its rules in carrying on their military
and naval operations. So long and in so far as belligerents
do this, their warfare is legitimate; if they do
not comply with the rules, their warfare is illegitimate.
Now, illegitimate acts and omissions can be committed
by belligerent Governments themselves, by the commanders
or members of their forces, and by their
subjects not belonging to the forces. Experience
teaches that, on the whole, omissions and the committal
of illegitimate acts on the part of individual
soldiers are unavoidable during war, since the passions
which are aroused by and during war will always
carry away some individuals. But belligerents bear a
vicarious responsibility for internationally illegal acts
of their soldiers, which turns into original responsibility
if they refuse to repair the wrong done by punishing
the offenders and, if necessary, indemnifying the
sufferers.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> Cases in which belligerent Governments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
themselves commit illegitimate acts, as well as cases
in which they refuse to punish their soldiers for illegitimate
acts constitute international delinquencies.<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
Now, if in time of peace an international delinquency
is committed, the offended State can, if the
worst comes to the worst, make war against the
offender to compel adequate reparation.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> But if
an international delinquency is committed during
warfare itself, no means whatever exist of compelling
reparation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>How Legitimate Warfare is on the
whole secured.</p></div>

<p>§ 242. Yet legitimate warfare is, on the whole at
any rate, secured through several means recognised by
International Law. These means of securing legitimate
warfare may be divided into three classes. The first
class comprises measures of self-help:&mdash;reprisals;
punishment of war crimes committed by enemy soldiers
and other enemy subjects; the taking of hostages.
The second class comprises:&mdash;complaints lodged with
the enemy; complaints lodged with neutral States;
good offices, mediation, and intervention on the part of
neutral States. And there is, thirdly, the fact that,
according to article 3 of Convention IV. of the Second
Peace Conference, belligerents are responsible for all
acts committed by persons forming part of their forces,
and are liable to make compensation, if the case demands
it, for any violation of the Hague Regulations.
These means, as I have said, do on the whole secure
the legitimacy of warfare, because it is to the interest
of either belligerent to prevent the enemy from getting
a justifiable opportunity of making use of them. On
the other hand, isolated illegitimate acts of individual
enemy soldiers will always occur; but they will in
many cases meet with punishment either by one
party to the war or the other. As regards hostile
acts of private enemy individuals not belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
to the armed forces, belligerents have a right<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> to
consider and punish them severely as acts of illegitimate
warfare.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_467_467" id="Footnote_467_467"></a><a href="#FNanchor_467_467"><span class="label">[467]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Complaints
lodged
with the
Enemy.</p></div>

<p>§ 243. Commanders of forces engaged in hostilities
frequently lodge complaints with each other regarding
single acts of illegitimate warfare committed by members
of their forces, such as abuses of the flag of truce, violations
of such flag or of the Geneva Convention, and the
like. The complaint is sent to the enemy under the
protection of a flag of truce, and the interest which
every commander takes in the legitimate behaviour of
his troops will always make him attend to complaints
and punish the offenders, provided the complaints concerned
are found to be justified. Very often, however,
it is impossible to verify the statements in the complaint,
and then certain assertions by one party, and
their denial by the other, face each other without there
being any way of solving the difficulty. It also often
happens during war that the belligerent Governments
lodge with each other mutual complaints of illegitimate
acts and omissions. Since diplomatic intercourse is
broken off during war, such complaints are either sent
to the enemy under the protection of a flag of truce or
through a neutral<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> State which lends its good offices.
But here too indignant assertion and emphatic denial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
frequently face each other without there being a way
of solving the conflict.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_468_468" id="Footnote_468_468"></a><a href="#FNanchor_468_468"><span class="label">[468]</span></a> Thus, in October 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, Japan
sent a complaint concerning the alleged use of Chinese clothing on the
part of Russian troops to the Russian Government, through the
intermediary of the United States of America; see Takahashi, pp.
174-178.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Complaints
lodged
with
Neutrals.</p></div>

<p>§ 244. If certain grave illegitimate acts or omissions
of warfare occur, belligerents frequently lodge
complaints with neutral States, either asking their
good offices, mediation, or intervention to make the
enemy comply with the laws of war, or simply drawing
their attention to the facts. Thus, at the beginning of
the Franco-German War, France lodged a complaint
with Great Britain and asked her intervention on
account of the intended creation of a volunteer fleet on
the part of Germany, which France considered a violation
of the Declaration of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Conversely, in
January 1871, Germany, in a circular addressed to her
diplomatic envoys abroad, and to be communicated
to the respective neutral Governments, complained of
twenty-one cases in which the French forces had, deliberately
and intentionally it was alleged, fired on
bearers of a flag of truce. Again, in November 1911,
and in February 1912, during the Turco-Italian War,
Turkey lodged a complaint with the Powers on account
of the execution of Arabs in Tripoli as war criminals,
and on account of the bombardment of Turkish war
vessels in the harbour of Beirut.<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Good Offices and Mediation.</p></div>

<p>§ 245. Complaints lodged with neutral States may
have the effect of one or more of the latter lending their
offices or their mediation to the belligerents for the
purpose of settling such conflict as arose out of the
alleged illegitimate acts or omissions of warfare, thus
preventing them from resorting to reprisals. Such
good offices and mediation do not differ from those
which settle a difference between States in time of
peace and which have been discussed above in §§ 7-11;
they are friendly acts in contradistinction to intervention,
which is dictatorial interference for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
of making the respective belligerents comply with the
laws of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Intervention
on the
part of
Neutrals.</p></div>

<p>§ 246. There can be no doubt that neutral States,
whether a complaint has been lodged with them or
not, may either singly, or jointly and collectively,
exercise intervention in cases of illegitimate acts or
omissions of warfare being committed by belligerent
Governments, or committed by members of belligerent
forces if the Governments concerned do not punish the
offenders. It will be remembered that it has been
stated above in
 <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#If4of135">Vol. I. § 135, No. 4</a>, that other States
have a right to intervene in case a State violates in
time of peace or war those principles of the Law of
Nations which are universally recognised. There is
not the slightest doubt that such principles of International
Law are endangered in case a belligerent
Government commits acts of illegitimate warfare or
does not punish the offenders in case such acts are
committed by members of its armed forces. But apart
from this, the Hague Regulations make illegitimate
acts of warfare on land now appear as by right the
affair of all signatory States to the Convention, and
therefore, in case of war between signatory States, the
neutral signatory States certainly would have a right
of intervention if acts of warfare were committed which
are illegitimate according to the Hague Regulations.
It must, however, be specially observed that any such intervention,
if it ever occurred, would have nothing to
do with the war in general and would not make the
intervening State a party to the war, but would concern
only the international delinquency committed by the
one belligerent through acts of illegitimate warfare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

between belligerents are retaliation of an illegitimate
act of warfare, whether constituting an international
delinquency or not, for the purpose of making
the enemy comply in future with the rules of legitimate
warfare. Reprisals between belligerents are terrible
means, because they are in most cases directed against
innocent enemy individuals, who must suffer for real or
alleged offences for which they are not responsible.
But reprisals cannot be dispensed with, because without
them illegitimate acts of warfare would be innumerable.
As matters stand, every belligerent and every member of
his forces knows for certain that reprisals are to be
expected in case they violate the rules of legitimate
warfare. And when nevertheless an illegal act occurs
and is promptly met with reprisals as a retaliation,
human nature would not be what it is if such retaliation
did not act as a deterrent against a repetition of

doing so, will lodge complaints with the enemy or with
neutral States. Practically, however, a belligerent will
rarely resort at once to reprisals, provided the violation
of the rules of legitimate warfare is not very grave
and the safety of his troops does not require prompt
and drastic measures. Thus, the Germans during the
Franco-German War frequently by way of reprisal,
bombarded and fired undefended open villages where
their soldiers were treacherously killed by enemy individuals
in ambush who did not belong to the armed
forces. And Lord Roberts, during the South African
War, ordered<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> by way of reprisal the destruction of

<div class="sidenote"><p>Danger of Arbitrariness in Reprisals.</p></div>

<p>§ 249. <a name="The_right_to_exercise249" id="The_right_to_exercise249"></a>The right to exercise reprisals carries with
it great danger of arbitrariness, for often the alleged
facts which make belligerents resort to reprisals are
not sufficiently verified, or the rules of war which they
consider the enemy has violated are sometimes not
generally recognised, or the act of reprisal performed
is often excessive compared with the precedent act of
illegitimate warfare. Three cases may illustrate this
danger.</p>

<p>(1) In 1782 Joshua Huddy, a captain in the army
of the American insurgents, was taken prisoner by
loyalists and handed over to a Captain Lippencott for
the ostensible purpose of being exchanged, but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
arbitrarily hanged. The commander of the British
troops had Lippencott arrested, and ordered him to be
tried for murder. Lippencott was, however, acquitted
by the court-martial, as there was evidence to show
that his command to execute Huddy was in accordance
with orders of a Board which he was bound to obey.
Thereupon some British officers who were prisoners of
war in the hands of the Americans were directed to
cast lots to determine who should be executed by way
of reprisal for the execution of Huddy. The lot fell
on Captain Asgill, a young officer only nineteen years
old, and he would have been executed but for the
mediation of the Queen of France, who saved his life.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>(2) "The British Government, having sent to
England, early in 1813, to be tried for treason, twenty-three
Irishmen, naturalised in the United States, who
had been captured on vessels of the United States,
Congress authorised the President to retaliate. Under
this act, General Dearborn placed in close confinement
twenty-three prisoners taken at Fort George. General
Prevost, under express directions of Lord Bathurst,
ordered the close imprisonment of double the number of
commissioned and non-commissioned United States'
officers. This was followed by a threat of 'unmitigated
severity against the American citizens and villages'
in case the system of retaliation was pursued. Mr.
Madison having retorted by putting in confinement a
similar number of British officers taken by the United
States, General Prevost immediately retorted by subjecting
to the same discipline all his prisoners whatsoever....
A better temper, however, soon came over
the British Government, by whom this system had
been instituted. A party of United States' officers,
who were prisoners of war in England, were released on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
parole, with instructions to state to the President that
the twenty-three prisoners who had been charged with
treason in England had not been tried, but remained
on the usual basis of prisoners of war. This led to the
dismissal on parole of all the officers of both sides."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>(3) During the Franco-German War the French
had captured forty German merchantmen, and made
their captains and crews prisoners of war. Count
Bismarck, who considered it against International Law
to detain these men as prisoners, demanded their liberation,
and when the French refused this, ordered by way
of reprisal forty French private individuals of local
importance to be arrested and to be sent as prisoners
of war to Bremen, where they were kept until the end
of the war. Count Bismarck was decidedly wrong,<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
since France had, as the law then stood, in no way
committed an illegal act by detaining the German crews
as prisoners of war.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Proposed
Restriction
of
Reprisals.</p></div>

<p>§ 250. The Hague Regulations do not mention
reprisals at all because the Brussels Conference of 1874,
which accepted the unratified Brussels Declaration,
had struck out several sections of the Russian draft code
regarding reprisals. These original sections<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> (69-71)
stipulated&mdash;(1) that reprisals should be admitted only in
extreme cases of absolutely certain violations of the
rules of legitimate warfare; (2) that the acts performed
by way of reprisal must not be excessive, but in proportion
to the respective violation; (3) that reprisals
should be ordered by commanders-in-chief only. Articles
85 and 86 of the Manual of the Laws of War, adopted
by the Institute of International Law,<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> propose the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
following rules:&mdash;(1) Reprisals are to be prohibited in
case reparation is given for the damage done by an
illegal act; (2) in grave cases, in which reprisals are an
imperative necessity, they must never exceed the degree
of the violation committed by the enemy; (3) they may
only be resorted to with the authorisation of the commander-in-chief;
(4) they must in every case respect
the laws of humanity and of morality. In face of the
arbitrariness with which, according to the present state
of International Law, reprisals may be exercised, it
cannot be denied that an agreement upon some precise
rules regarding reprisals is an imperative necessity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of War Crimes.</p></div>

<p>§ 251. <a name="In_contradistinction251" id="In_contradistinction251"></a>In contradistinction to hostile acts of soldiers
by which the latter do not lose their privilege of being
treated as members of armed forces who have done
no wrong, war crimes are such hostile or other acts
of soldiers or other individuals as may be punished by
the enemy on capture of the offenders. It must, however,
be emphasised that the term war crime is used,
not in the moral sense of the term crime, but only in a
technical legal sense, on account of the fact that perpetrators
of these acts may be punished by the enemy.
For, although among the acts called war crimes are
many which are crimes in the moral sense of the term,
such, for instance, as the abuse of a flag of truce or
assassination of enemy soldiers; there are others which
may be highly praiseworthy and patriotic acts, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
taking part in a levy <i>en masse</i> on territory occupied by
the enemy. But because every belligerent may, and
actually must, in the interest of his own safety punish
these acts, they are termed war crimes, whatever may
be the motive, the purpose, and the moral character
of the respective act.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Different
kinds of
War
Crimes.</p></div>

<p>§ 252. In spite of the uniform designation of these
acts as war crimes, four different kinds of war crimes
must be distinguished on account of the essentially
different character of the acts. Violations of recognised
rules regarding warfare committed by members
of the armed forces belong to the first kind; all hostilities
in arms committed by individuals who are not
members of the enemy armed forces constitute the
second kind; espionage and war treason belong to the
third; and all marauding acts belong to the fourth kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Violations of Rules regarding Warfare.</p></div>

<p>§ 253. Violations of rules regarding warfare are
war crimes only when committed without an order of
the belligerent Government concerned. If members of
the armed forces commit violations <i>by order</i> of their
Government, they are not war criminals and may not
be punished by the enemy; the latter may, however,
resort to reprisals. In case members of forces commit
violations ordered by their commanders, the members
may not be punished, for the commanders are alone
responsible, and the latter may, therefore, be punished
as war criminals on their capture by the enemy.</p>

<p>The following are the more important violations that
may occur:</p>

<p>(1) Making use of poisoned or otherwise forbidden
arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>(2) Killing or wounding soldiers disabled by sickness
or wounds, or who have laid down arms and
surrendered.</p>

<p>(3) Assassination, and hiring of assassins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) Treacherous request for quarter, or treacherous
feigning of sickness and wounds.</p>

<p>(5) Ill-treatment of prisoners of war, of the wounded
and sick. Appropriation of such of their money and
valuables as are not public property.</p>

<p>(6) Killing or attacking harmless private enemy individuals.
Unjustified appropriation and destruction
of their private property, and especially pillaging.
Compulsion of the population of occupied territory to
furnish information about the army of the other belligerent
or about his means of defence.</p>

<p>(7) Disgraceful treatment of dead bodies on battlefields.
Appropriation of such money and other valuables
found upon dead bodies as are not public property,
nor arms, ammunition, and the like.</p>

<p>(8) Appropriation and destruction of property belonging
to museums, hospitals, churches, schools, and
the like.</p>

<p>(9) Assault, siege, and bombardment of undefended
open towns and other habitations. Unjustified bombardment
of undefended places on the part of naval
forces.</p>

<p>(10) Unnecessary bombardment of historical monuments,
and of such hospitals and buildings devoted
to religion, art, science, and charity, as are indicated
by particular signs notified to the besiegers bombarding
a defended town.</p>

<p>(11) Violations of the Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>(12) Attack on or sinking of enemy vessels which
have hauled down their flags as a sign of surrender.
Attack on enemy merchantmen without previous request
to submit to visit.</p>

<p>(13) Attack or seizure of hospital ships, and all
other violations of the Hague Convention for the
adaptation to naval warfare of the principles of the
Geneva Convention.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>(14) Unjustified destruction of enemy prizes.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>(15) Use of enemy uniforms and the like during
battle, use of the enemy flag during attack by a belligerent
vessel.</p>

<p>(16) Violation of enemy individuals furnished with
passports or safe-conducts, violation of safeguards.</p>

<p>(17) Violation of bearers of flags of truce.</p>

<p>(18) Abuse of the protection granted to flags of
truce.</p>

<p>(19) Violation of cartels, capitulations, and armistices.</p>

<p>(20) Breach of parole.</p>

 below, § <a href="#That_as_a_rule431">431</a>&mdash;is not a war crime, but is nevertheless an international
delinquency, if ordered by the belligerent government.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Hostilities in Arms by Private Individuals.</p></div>

<p>§ 254. <a name="Since_International_Law254" id="Since_International_Law254"></a>Since International Law is a law between
States only and exclusively, no rules of International
Law can exist which prohibit private individuals from
taking up arms and committing hostilities against the
enemy. But private individuals committing such acts
do not enjoy the privileges of members of armed forces,
and the enemy has according to a customary rule of
International Law the right to consider and punish
such individuals as war criminals. Hostilities in arms
committed by private individuals are not war crimes
because they really are violations of recognised rules
regarding warfare, but because the enemy has the right
to consider and punish them as acts of illegitimate
warfare. The conflict between praiseworthy patriotism
on the part of such individuals and the safety of the
enemy troops does not allow of any solution. It would
be unreasonable for International Law to impose upon
belligerents the duty to forbid the taking up of arms
by their private subjects, because such action may
occasionally be of the greatest value to a belligerent,
especially for the purpose of freeing a country from
the enemy who has militarily occupied it. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
the safety of his troops compels the enemy to consider
and punish such hostilities as acts of illegitimate warfare,
and International Law gives him a right to do so.</p>

<p>It is usual to make a distinction between hostilities
in arms on the part of private individuals against an
invading or retiring enemy on the one hand, and, on
the other, hostilities in arms committed on the part of
the inhabitants against an enemy occupying a conquered
territory. In the latter case one speaks of war
rebellion, whether inhabitants take up arms singly or
rise in a so-called levy <i>en masse</i>. Articles 1 and 2 of
the Hague Regulations make the greatest possible
concessions regarding hostilities committed by irregulars.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>
Beyond the limits of these concessions belligerents
will never be able to go without the greatest
danger to their troops.</p>

 above, §§ <a href="#Very_often_the_armed80">80</a> and <a href="#It_sometimes81">81</a>.</p></div>

<p>It must be particularly noted that merchantmen of
belligerents, which attack enemy vessels without previously
having been attacked by them, commit a war
crime,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> and that the captains, officers, and members of
the crews may, therefore, be punished as war criminals
to the same extent as private individuals who commit
hostilities in land warfare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Espionage and War Treason.</p></div>

<p>§ 255. <a name="Article_24_of_the_Hague255" id="Article_24_of_the_Hague255"></a>Article 24 of the Hague Regulations now
enacts the old customary rule that a belligerent has a
right to employ all methods necessary to obtain information,
and these methods include espionage and
treason. But this right stands face to face with the
right to consider and punish as war criminals enemy
individuals, whether soldiers or not, committing acts of
espionage or treason. There is an irreconcilable conflict
between the necessity of obtaining information on
the one hand, and self-preservation on the other; and
accordingly espionage and treason, as has been explained
above in § <a href="#War_cannot_be159">159</a>, bear a twofold character. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
the one hand, International Law gives a right to belligerents
to make use of espionage and treason. On the
other hand, the same law gives a right to belligerents to
consider espionage and treason, committed by enemy
soldiers or enemy private individuals within their lines,
as acts of illegitimate warfare, and consequently
punishable.</p>

<p>Espionage has already been treated above in
§§ <a href="#War_cannot_be159">159</a>-161. War treason may be committed in different
ways. The following are the chief cases of war treason
that may occur:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Information of any kind given to the enemy.</p>

<p>(2) Voluntary supply of money, provisions, ammunition,
horses, clothing, and the like, to the enemy.</p>

<p>(3) Any voluntary assistance to military operations
of the enemy, be it by serving as guide in the country,
by opening the door of a defended habitation, by
repairing a destroyed bridge, or otherwise.</p>

<p>(4) Attempt to induce soldiers to desert, to surrender,
to serve as spies, and the like, and negotiating
desertion, surrender, and espionage offered by soldiers.</p>

<p>(5) Attempt to bribe soldiers or officials in the
interest of the enemy, and negotiating such bribe.</p>

<p>(6) Liberation of enemy prisoners of war.</p>

<p>(7) Conspiracy against the armed forces or against
individual officers and members of them.</p>

<p>(8) Wrecking of military trains, destruction of the
lines of communication or of the telegraphs or telephones
in the interest of the enemy, and the destruction
of any war material for the same purpose.</p>

<p>(9) Circulation of enemy proclamations dangerous
to the interests of the belligerent concerned.</p>

<p>(10) Intentional false guidance of troops by a hired
guide or by one who offered his services voluntarily.</p>

<p>(11) Rendering courier or similar services to the
enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be specially observed that enemy soldiers&mdash;in
contradistinction to private enemy individuals&mdash;may
only be punished for war treason when they have
committed the act of treason during their stay within a
belligerent's lines under disguise. If, for instance, two
soldiers in uniform are sent into the rear of the enemy
for the purpose of destroying a bridge, they may not,
when caught by the enemy, be punished for war treason,
because their act was one of legitimate warfare. But
if they exchange their uniforms for plain clothes and
thereby appear as members of the peaceful private
population, they may be punished for war treason.
A remarkable case of this kind occurred in the summer
of 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War. Two Japanese
disguised in Chinese clothes were caught in the attempt
to destroy, with the aid of dynamite, a railway bridge
in Manchuria, in the rear of the Russian forces. Brought
before a court-martial, they confessed themselves to be
Shozo Jakoga, forty-three years of age, a Major on the
Japanese General Staff, and Teisuki Oki, thirty-one
years of age, a Captain on the Japanese General Staff.
They were convicted, and condemned to be hanged, but
the mode of punishment was changed and they were
shot. All the newspapers which mentioned this case
reported it as a case of espionage, but it is in fact one
of war treason. Although the two officers were in
disguise, their conviction for espionage was impossible
according to article 29 of the Hague Regulations, provided,
of course, they were court-martialed for no other
act than the attempt to destroy a bridge.</p>

<p>It must be particularly noted that there are many
acts of inhabitants which a belligerent may forbid and
punish in the interests of order and the safety of his
army, although these acts do not fall under the category
of war treason, and are not therefore punished as war
crimes. To this class belong all acts which violate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
orders legitimately decreed by an occupant of enemy
territory.<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Marauding.</p></div>

<p>§ 256. Marauders are individuals roving either
singly or collectively in bands over battlefields, or
following advancing or retreating forces in quest of
booty. They have nothing to do with warfare in the
strict sense of the term, but they are an unavoidable
accessory to warfare and frequently consist of soldiers
who have left their corps. Their acts are considered
acts of illegitimate warfare, and their punishment takes
place in the interest of the safety of either belligerent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Mode of Punishment of War Crimes.</p></div>

<p>§ 257. <a name="All_war_crimes257" id="All_war_crimes257"></a>All war crimes may be punished with death,
but belligerents may, of course, inflict a more lenient
punishment, or commute a sentence of death into a
more lenient penalty. If this be done and imprisonment
take the place of capital punishment, the question
arises whether such convicts must be released at the
end of the war, although their term of imprisonment
has not yet expired. Some publicists<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> answer this
question in the affirmative, maintaining that it could
never be lawful to inflict a penalty extending beyond
the duration of the war. But I believe that the question
has to be answered in the negative. If a belligerent
has a right to pronounce a sentence of capital
punishment, it is obvious that he may select a more
lenient penalty and carry the latter out even beyond
the duration of the war. And it would in no wise be
in the interest of humanity to deny this right, for otherwise
belligerents would have always to pronounce and

<div class="sidenote"><p>Former
Practice
of taking
Hostages.</p></div>

<p>§ 258. <a name="The_practice_of_taking_hostages258" id="The_practice_of_taking_hostages258"></a>The practice of taking hostages as a means
of securing legitimate warfare prevailed in former
times much more than nowadays. It was frequently resorted
to in cases in which belligerent forces depended
more or less upon each other's good faith, such as
capitulations and armistices for instance. To make
sure that no perfidy was intended, officers or prominent
private individuals were taken as hostages and could be
held responsible with their lives for any perfidy committed
by the enemy. This practice has totally disappeared,
and is hardly likely to be revived. But
this former practice must not be confounded with the
still existing practice of seizing enemy individuals
for the purpose of making them the object of reprisals.
Thus, when in 1870, during the Franco-German War,
Count Bismarck ordered forty French notables to be
seized and to be taken away into captivity as a retaliation
upon the French for refusing to liberate the
crews of forty captured merchantmen, these forty
French notables were not taken as hostages, but were
made the object of reprisals.<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

 above in § <a href="#The_right_to_exercise249">249</a>. All the French
writers who comment upon this case make the mistake of referring to it
as an instance of the taking of hostages.</p></div>

<p>§ 259. <a name="A_new_practice259" id="A_new_practice259"></a>A new practice of taking hostages was resorted
to by the Germans in 1870 during the Franco-German
War for the purpose of securing the safety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
forces against possible hostile acts on the part of private
inhabitants of occupied enemy territory. Well-known
men were seized and detained in the expectation that
the population would refrain from hostile acts out of
regard for the fate of the hostages. Thus, when unknown
people frequently wrecked the trains transporting
troops, the Germans seized prominent enemy
citizens and put them on the engines of trains to prevent
the latter from being wrecked, a means which always
proved effective and soon put a stop to further train-wrecking.
The same practice was resorted to, although
for a short time only, by Lord Roberts<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> in 1900
during the South African War. This practice has been
condemned by the majority of publicists. But, with all
due deference to the authority of so many prominent men
who oppose the practice, I cannot agree with their
opinion. Matters would be different if hostages were
seized and exposed to dangers for the purpose of preventing
legitimate hostilities on the part of members
of the armed forces of the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> But no one can
deny that train-wrecking on occupied enemy territory
by private enemy individuals is an act which a belligerent
is justified in considering and punishing as war
treason.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> It is for the purpose of guarding against an
act of illegitimate warfare that these hostages are put
on the engines. The danger they are exposed to comes
from their fellow-citizens, who are informed of the fact
that hostages are on the engines and who ought therefore
to refrain from wrecking the trains. It cannot,
and will not, be denied that the measure is a harsh one,
and that it makes individuals liable to suffer for acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
for which they are not responsible. But the safety of
his troops and lines of communication is at stake for
the belligerent concerned, and I doubt, therefore,
whether even the most humane commanders will be
able to dispense with this measure, since it alone has
proved effective. And it must further be taken into
consideration that the amount of cruelty connected
with it is no greater than in reprisals where also innocent
individuals must suffer for illegitimate acts for which
they are not responsible. And is it not more reasonable
to prevent train-wrecking by putting hostages on the
engines than to resort to reprisals for wreckage of trains?
For there is no doubt that a belligerent is justified in
resorting to reprisals<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> in each case of train-wrecking

Principle
of Compensation
for Violations
of
the Laws
of War
arose.</p></div>

<p>§ 259<i>a</i>. <a name="There_is_no_doubt259a" id="There_is_no_doubt259a"></a>There is no doubt that, if a belligerent can
be made to pay compensation for all damage done by
him in violating the laws of war, this will be an indirect
means of securing legitimate warfare. In former times
no rule existed which stipulated such compensation,
although, of course, violation of the laws of war was
always an international delinquency. On the contrary,
it was an established customary rule<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> that claims for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
reparation of damages caused by violations of the rules
of legitimate warfare could not be raised after the conclusion
of peace, unless the contrary was expressly
stipulated. It was not until the Second Hague Peace
Conference that matters underwent a change. In revising
the Convention concerning the laws and customs
of war on land, besides other alterations, a new article
(3) was adopted which enacts that a belligerent who
violates the provisions of the Hague Regulations, shall, if
the case demand, be liable to make compensation, and
that he shall be responsible for all acts committed by
persons forming part of his armed forces.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_492_492" id="Footnote_492_492"></a><a href="#FNanchor_492_492"><span class="label">[492]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#Since_a_treaty_of_peace274">274</a>, p. 335.</p></div>

<p>Attention should be drawn to the fact that Germany,
on whose initiative this principle was adopted, proposed
two articles concerning the matter, the one dealing
with the payment of compensation for violations of the
Hague Regulations with regard to subjects of neutral
States,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> and the other for violations of these Regulations
with regard to enemy subjects. The conference, however,
preferred to make no distinction between the
different cases of violation but to adopt the general
principle.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_493_493" id="Footnote_493_493"></a><a href="#FNanchor_493_493"><span class="label">[493]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Compensation
for
Violations
of the
Hague
Regulations.</p></div>

<p>§ 259<i>b</i>. It is apparent that article 3 of Convention
IV. enacts two different rules: firstly, that a belligerent
who violates the Hague Regulations shall, if the case
demand, pay compensation; and secondly, that a
belligerent is responsible for all acts committed by any
person forming part of his armed forces.</p>

<p>To take this second rule first, the responsibility of
a State for internationally illegal acts on the part of
members of its armed forces is, provided the acts have
not been committed by the State's command or authorisation,
only a vicarious responsibility, but nevertheless
the State concerned must, as was pointed out above,
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#In163">Vol. I. § 163</a>, pay damages for these acts when required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
For this reason, article 3 does not create a new rule in
so far as it enacts that belligerents must pay for damage
caused by members of their forces.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the rule that compensation
must be paid by belligerents for damage done through
violations of the Hague Regulations, is a new rule, at
any rate in so far as it is laid down in a general way.
If interpreted according to the letter, article 3 of
Convention IV. establishes the rule for payment of
compensation for violations of the Hague Regulations
only, and not for violations of other rules of International
Law concerning land warfare or even concerning
sea warfare. I have, however, no doubt that
the Powers would recognise that the principle of article 3
must find application to any rule of the laws of war, if
by the violation of such rule subjects of the enemy, or
of neutral States, suffer damage. For instance, if the
commander of a naval force, in contravention of
Convention IX. of the Second Peace Conference, were
to bombard an undefended place, compensation could
be claimed for such subjects of the enemy and subjects
of neutral States as suffered damage through the
bombardment.</p>

<p>A point, however, to be kept in view is that article 3,
although it establishes the obligation to pay compensation,
does not stipulate anything concerning the
time or the way in which claims for compensation are
to be settled. This is clearly a case for arbitration, and
it is to be hoped that the Third Peace Conference will
make arbitration obligatory in cases of claims for
compensation arising from violations, on the part of
a belligerent, of the Hague Regulations as well as of
other laws of war.</p>

<p>§ 260. The normal condition between two States
being peace, war can never be more than a temporary
condition; whatever may have been the cause or
causes of a war, the latter cannot possibly last for ever.
For either the purpose of war will be realised and one
belligerent will be overpowered by the other, or both
will sooner or later be so exhausted by their exertions
that they will desist from the struggle. Nevertheless
wars may last for many years, although of late European
wars have gradually become shorter. The shortening
of European wars in recent times has resulted from
several causes, the more important of which are:&mdash;conscription,
the foundation of the armies of all the
great European Powers, Great Britain excepted; the
net of railways which extends over all European
countries, and which enables a much quicker transport
of troops on enemy territory; and lastly, the vast
numbers of the opposing forces which usually hasten a
decisive battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Three Modes of Termination of War.</p></div>

<p>§ 261. Be that as it may, a war may be terminated
in three different ways. Belligerents may, first, abstain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>


<p>from further acts of war and glide into peaceful relations
without expressly making peace through a
special treaty. Or, secondly, belligerents may formally
establish the condition of peace through a special treaty
of peace. Or, thirdly, a belligerent may end the war
through subjugation of his adversary.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

cessation of hostilities or through a treaty of peace need hardly be
mentioned. But it is of importance to state the fact that there is a
difference between civil war and other war concerning the third mode of
ending war, namely subjugation. For to terminate a civil war, conquest
<i>and</i> annexation, which together make subjugation, is unnecessary (see
below, § <a href="#Subjugation_must_not264">264</a>), but conquest alone is sufficient.</p></div>

<p>§ 262. The regular modes of termination of war
are treaties of peace or subjugation, but cases have
occurred in which simple cessation of all acts of war
on the part of both belligerents has actually and informally
brought the war to an end. Thus ended in
1716 the war between Sweden and Poland, in 1720 the
war between Spain and France, in 1801 the war between
Russia and Persia, in 1867 the war between France and
Mexico. And it may also be mentioned that, whereas
the war between Prussia and several German States in
1866 came to an end through subjugation of some
States and through treaties of peace with others,
Prussia has never concluded a treaty of peace with the
Principality of Lichtenstein, which was also a party to
the war. Although such termination of war through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
simple cessation of hostilities is for many reasons inconvenient,
and is, therefore, as a rule avoided, it may
nevertheless in the future as in the past occasionally
occur.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Termination of War through simple Cessation of

<p>§ 263. <a name="Since_in_the_case263" id="Since_in_the_case263"></a>Since in the case of termination of war
through simple cessation of hostilities no treaty of
peace embodies the conditions of peace between the
former belligerents, the question arises whether the
<i>status</i> which existed between the parties before the
outbreak of war, the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>, should be
revived, or the <i>status</i> which exists between the parties at
the time when they simply ceased hostilities, the <i>status
quo post bellum</i> (the <i>uti possidetis</i>), can be upheld. The
majority of publicists<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> correctly maintain that the
<i>status</i> which exists at the time of cessation of hostilities
becomes silently recognised through such cessation,
and is, therefore, the basis of the future relations of the
parties. This question is of the greatest importance
regarding enemy territory militarily occupied by a
belligerent at the time hostilities cease. According to
the correct opinion such territory can be annexed by
the occupier, the adversary through the cessation of
hostilities having dropped all rights he possessed over
such territory. On the other hand, this termination of
war through cessation of hostilities contains no decision
regarding such claims of the parties as have not been
settled by the actual position of affairs at the termination
of hostilities, and it remains for the parties to settle
them by special agreement or to let them stand over.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Subjugation in contradistinction to Conquest.</p></div>

<p>§ 264. <a name="Subjugation_must_not264" id="Subjugation_must_not264"></a>Subjugation must not be confounded with
conquest, although there can be no subjugation without
conquest. Conquest is taking possession of enemy
territory by military force. Conquest is completed as
soon as the territory concerned is effectively<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> occupied.
Now it is obvious that conquest of a part of enemy
territory has nothing to do with subjugation, because
the enemy may well reconquer it. But even the conquest
of the whole of the enemy territory need not
necessarily include subjugation. For, first, in a war
between more than two belligerents the troops of one
of them may evacuate their country and join the army
of allies, so that the armed contention is continued,
although the territory of one of the allies is completely
conquered. Again, a belligerent, although he has
annihilated the forces, conquered the whole of the
territory of his adversary, and thereby actually brought
the armed contention to an end,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> may nevertheless not

peace with the expelled or imprisoned head of the
defeated State, re-establish the latter's Government,
and hand the whole or a part of the conquered territory
over to it. Subjugation takes place only when a belligerent,
after having annihilated the forces and conquered
the territory of his adversary, destroys his
existence by annexing the conquered territory. Subjugation
may, therefore, correctly be defined as <i>extermination
in war of one belligerent by another through

<div class="sidenote"><p>Subjugation a formal End of War.</p></div>

<p>§ 265. Although complete conquest, together with
annihilation of the enemy forces, brings the armed
contention, and thereby the war, actually to an end,
the formal end of the war is thereby not yet realised,
as everything depends upon the resolution of the
victor regarding the fate of the vanquished State. If
he be willing to re-establish the captive or expelled
head of the vanquished State, it is a treaty of peace
concluded with the latter which terminates the war.
But if he desires to acquire the whole of the conquered
territory for himself, he annexes it, and thereby formally
ends the war through subjugation. That the expelled
head of the vanquished State protests and keeps up his
claims, matters as little eventually as protests on the
part of neutral States. These protests may be of
political importance for the future, legally they are of
no importance at all.</p>

<p>History presents numerous instances of subjugation.
Although no longer so frequent as in former times,
subjugation is not at all of rare occurrence. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
modern Italy came into existence through the subjugation
by Sardinia in 1859 of the Two Sicilies, the
Grand Dukedom of Tuscany, the Dukedoms of Parma
and Modena, and in 1870 the Papal States. Thus,
further, Prussia subjugated in 1866 the Kingdom of
Hanover, the Dukedom of Nassau, the Electorate of
Hesse-Cassel, and the Free Town of Frankfort-on-the-Main.
And Great Britain annexed in 1900 the Orange
Free State and the South African Republic.<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_500_500" id="Footnote_500_500"></a><a href="#FNanchor_500_500"><span class="label">[500]</span></a> Since Great Britain annexed these territories in 1900, the
agreement of 1902, regarding "Terms of Surrender of the Boer Forces in
the Field"&mdash;see <i>Parliamentary Papers</i>, South Africa, 1902, Cd. 1096&mdash;is
not a treaty of peace, and the South African War came formally to an end
through subjugation, although&mdash;see above, § <a href="#Footnote_330_330">167, p. 209, note 1</a>&mdash;the
proclamation of the annexation was somewhat premature. The agreement
embodying the terms of surrender of the routed remnants of the Boer
forces has, therefore, no internationally le gal basis (see also
 below, § <a href="#Footnote_511_511">274, p. 334, note 2</a>). The case would be different if the British
Government had really&mdash;as Sir Thomas Barclay asserts in <i>The Law
Quarterly Review</i>, XXI. (1905), pp. 303 and 307&mdash;recognised the
existence of the Government of the South African Republic down to May
31, 1902.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Treaty of Peace the most frequent End of War.</p></div>

<p>§ 266. Although occasionally war ends through
simple cessation of hostilities, and although subjugation
is not at all rare or irregular, the most frequent
end of war is a treaty of peace. Many publicists
correctly call a treaty of peace the normal mode of
terminating war. On the one hand, simple cessation
of hostilities is certainly an irregular mode. Subjugation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
on the other hand, is in most cases either
not within the scope of the intention of the victor or
not realisable. And it is quite reasonable that a treaty
of peace should be the normal end of war. States which
are driven from disagreement to war will, sooner or
later, when the fortune of war has given its decision,
be convinced that the armed contention ought to be
terminated. Thus a mutual understanding and agreement
upon certain terms is the normal mode of ending
the contention. And it is a treaty of peace which embodies
such understanding.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Peace
Negotiations.</p></div>

<p>§ 267. <a name="However_as_the_outbreak267" id="However_as_the_outbreak267"></a>However, as the outbreak of war interrupts
all regular non-hostile intercourse between belligerents,
negotiations for peace are often difficult of initiation.
Each party, although willing to negotiate, may have
strong reasons for not opening negotiations. Good
offices and mediation on the part of neutrals, therefore,
always are of great importance, as thereby negotiations
are called into existence which otherwise might have
been long delayed. But it must be emphasised that
neither formal nor informal peace negotiations do
<i>ipso facto</i> bring hostilities to a standstill, although a
partial or general armistice may be concluded for the
purpose of such negotiations. The fact that peace
negotiations are going on directly between belligerents
does not create any non-hostile relations between
them apart from those negotiations themselves. Such
negotiations can take place by the exchange of letters
between the belligerent Governments, or through special
negotiators who may meet on neutral territory or on
the territory of one of the belligerents. In case they
meet on belligerent territory, the enemy negotiators are
inviolable and must be treated on the same footing as
bearers of flags of truce, if not as diplomatic envoys.
For it can happen that a belligerent receives an enemy
diplomatic envoy for the purpose of peace negotiations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Be that as it may, negotiations, wherever taking place
and by whomsoever conducted, may always be broken
off before an agreement is arrived at.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Preliminaries
of Peace.</p></div>

<p>§ 268. Although ready to terminate the war through
a treaty of peace, belligerents are frequently not able
to settle all the terms of peace at once. In such cases
hostilities are usually brought to an end through so-called
preliminaries of peace, the definite treaty, which
has to take the place of the preliminaries, being concluded
later on. Such preliminaries are a treaty in
themselves, embodying an agreement of the parties
regarding such terms of peace as are essential. Preliminaries
are as binding as any other treaty, and
therefore they need ratification. Very often, but not
necessarily, the definitive treaty of peace is concluded
at a place other than that at which the preliminaries
were settled. Thus, the war between Austria, France,
and Sardinia was ended by the Preliminaries of Villafranca
of July 11, 1859, yet the definitive treaty of
peace was concluded at Zurich on November 10, 1859.
The war between Austria and Prussia was ended by the
Preliminaries of Nickolsburg of July 26, 1866, yet the
definitive treaty of peace was concluded at Prague on
August 23. In the Franco-German War the Preliminaries
of Versailles of February 26, 1871, were the
precursor of the definitive treaty of peace concluded
at Frankfort on May 10, 1871.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_501_501" id="Footnote_501_501"></a><a href="#FNanchor_501_501"><span class="label">[501]</span></a> No preliminaries of peace were agreed upon at the end of
the Russo-Japanese war. After negotiations at Portsmouth (New Hampshire)
had led to a final understanding on August 29, 1905, the treaty of peace
was signed on September 5, and ratified on October 16.</p></div>

<p>The purpose for which preliminaries of peace are
agreed upon makes it obvious that such essential
terms of peace as are stipulated by the Preliminaries
are the basis of the definitive treaty of peace. It may
happen, however, that neutral States protest for the
purpose of preventing this. Thus, when the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
between Russia and Turkey had been ended through
the Preliminaries of San Stefano of March 3, 1878,
Great Britain protested, a Congress met at Berlin,
and Russia had to be content with less favourable
terms of peace than those stipulated at San Stefano.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Form and Parts of Peace Treaties.</p></div>

<p>§ 269. International Law does not contain any
rules regarding the form of peace treaties; they may,
therefore, be concluded verbally or in writing. But
the importance of the matter makes the parties always
conclude a treaty of peace in writing, and there is no
instance of a verbally concluded treaty of peace.</p>

<p>According to the different points stipulated, it is
usual to distinguish different parts within a peace treaty.
Besides the preamble, there are general, special, and
separate articles. General articles are those which
stipulate such points as are to be agreed upon in every
treaty of peace, as the date of termination of hostilities,
the release of prisoners of war, and the like. Special
articles are those which stipulate the special terms of
the agreement of peace in question. Separate articles
are those which stipulate points with regard to the
execution of the general and special articles, or which
contain reservations and other special remarks of the
parties. Sometimes <i>additional</i> articles occur. Such are
stipulations agreed upon in a special treaty following
the treaty of peace and comprising stipulations regarding
such points as have not been mentioned in
the treaty of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Competence
to
conclude
Peace.</p></div>

<p>§ 270. As the treaty-making Power is according
to the Law of Nations in the hands of the head<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> of
the State, it is he who is competent to conclude peace.
But just as constitutional restrictions imposed upon
heads of States regarding their general power of concluding
treaties<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> are of importance for International
Law, so constitutional restrictions imposed upon heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
of States regarding their competence to make peace
are of similar importance. And, therefore, such treaties
of peace concluded by heads of States as violate constitutional
restrictions are not binding upon the States
concerned, because the heads have exceeded their
powers. The Constitutions of the several States settle
the matter differently, and it is not at all necessary that
the power of declaring war and that of making peace
should be vested by a Constitution in the same hands.
In Great Britain the power of the Crown to declare war
and to make peace is indeed unrestricted. But in the
German Empire, for instance, it is different; for whereas
the Emperor, the case of an attack on German territory
excepted, may declare war only with the consent of the
Bundesrath, his power of making peace is unrestricted.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>The controverted question as to whether the head of
a State who is a prisoner of war is competent to make
peace ought to be answered in the negative. The
reason is that the head of a constitutional State, although
he does not by becoming a prisoner of war lose
his position, he nevertheless thereby loses the power of
exercising the rights connected with his position.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Date of Peace.</p></div>

<p>§ 271. <a name="Unless_the_treaty271" id="Unless_the_treaty271"></a>Unless the treaty provides otherwise, peace
commences with the signing of the peace treaty. Should
the latter not be ratified, hostilities may be recommenced,
and the unratified peace treaty is considered as
an armistice. Sometimes, however, the peace treaty
fixes a future date for the commencement of peace,
stipulating that hostilities must cease on a certain
future day. This is the case when war is waged in
several or widely separated parts of the world, and
when, therefore, it is impossible at once to inform the
opposing forces of the conclusion of peace.<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> It may even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
occur that different dates are stipulated for the termination
of hostilities in different parts of the world.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_506_506" id="Footnote_506_506"></a><a href="#FNanchor_506_506"><span class="label">[506]</span></a> The ending of the Russo-Japanese war was quite peculiar.
Although the treaty of peace was signed on September 5, 1905, the
agreement concerning an armistice pending ratification of the peace
treaty was not signed until September 14, and hostilities went on till
September 16.</p></div>

<p>The question has arisen as to whether, in case a
peace treaty provides a future date for the termination
of hostilities in distant parts, and in case the forces in
these parts hear of the conclusion of peace before such
date, they must abstain at once from further hostilities.
Most publicists correctly answer this question in the
affirmative. But the French Prize Courts in 1801
condemned as a good prize the English vessel <i>Swineherd</i>
which was captured by the French privateer
<i>Bellona</i> in the Indian Seas within the period of five
months fixed by the Peace of Amiens for the termination
of hostilities in these seas.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Restoration of Condition of Peace.</p></div>

<p>§ 272. The chief and general effect of a peace treaty
is restoration of the condition of peace between the
former belligerents. As soon as the treaty is ratified,
all rights and duties which exist in time of peace between
the members of the family of nations are <i>ipso
facto</i> and at once revived between the former belligerents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>On the one hand, all acts legitimate in warfare
cease to be legitimate. Neither contributions and requisitions,
nor attacks on members of the armed forces
or on fortresses, nor capture of ships, nor occupation of
territory are any longer lawful. If forces, ignorant of
the conclusion of peace, commit such hostile acts, the
condition of things at the time peace was concluded
must as far as possible be restored.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> Thus, ships
captured must be set free, territory occupied must be
evacuated, members of armed forces taken prisoners
must be liberated, contributions imposed and paid
must be repaid.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_508_508" id="Footnote_508_508"></a><a href="#FNanchor_508_508"><span class="label">[508]</span></a> The <i>Mentor</i> (1799), 1 C. Rob. 179.
Matters are, of course, different in
case a future date&mdash;see above, § <a href="#Unless_the_treaty271">271</a>&mdash;is
stipulated for the termination
of hostilities.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, all peaceful intercourse between
the former belligerents as well as between their subjects
is resumed as before the war. Thus diplomatic intercourse
is restored, and consular officers recommence
their duties.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

subjects of belligerents as have been suspended by the outbreak of war
revive <i>ipso facto</i> by the conclusion of peace is not the outcome of a
rule of International Law. But just as Municipal Law may suspend such
contracts <i>ipso facto</i> by the outbreak of war, so it may revive them
<i>ipso facto</i> by the conclusion of peace. See above, § <a href="#Following101">101</a>.</p></div>

<p>Attention must be drawn to the fact that the condition
of peace created by a peace treaty is legally
final in so far as the order of things set up and stipulated
by the treaty of peace is the settled basis of future relations
between the parties, however contentious the
matters concerned may have been before the outbreak
of war. In concluding peace the parties expressly or
implicitly declare that they have come to an understanding
regarding such settled matters. They may
indeed make war against each other in future on other
grounds, but they are legally bound not to go to war
over such matters as have been settled by a previous
treaty of peace. That the practice of States does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
not always comply with this rule is a well-known fact
which, although it discredits this rule, cannot shake
its theoretical validity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Principle of <i>Uti Possidetis</i>.</p></div>

<p>§ 273. <a name="Un273" id="Un273"></a>Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the
effect of a treaty of peace is that conditions remain as
at the conclusion of peace. Thus, all moveable State
property, as munitions, provisions, arms, money, horses,
means of transport, and the like, seized by an invading
belligerent remain his property, as likewise do the
fruits of immoveable property seized by him. Thus
further, if nothing is stipulated regarding conquered
territory, it remains in the hands of the possessor, who
may annex it. But it is nowadays usual, although not
at all legally necessary, for the conqueror desirous of
retaining conquered territory to stipulate cession of
such territory in the treaty of peace.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Amnesty.</p></div>

<p>§ 274. <a name="Since_a_treaty_of_peace274" id="Since_a_treaty_of_peace274"></a>Since a treaty of peace is considered a final
settlement of the war, one of the effects of every peace
treaty is the so-called amnesty&mdash;that is, an immunity
for all wrongful acts done by the belligerents themselves,
the members of their forces, and their subjects
during the war, and due to political motives.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> It is
usual, but not at all necessary, to insert an amnesty
clause in a treaty of peace. So-called war crimes<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
which were not punished before the conclusion of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
may no longer be punished after its conclusion. Individuals
who have committed such war crimes and
have been arrested for them must be liberated.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> International
delinquencies committed intentionally by
belligerents through violation of the rules of legitimate
warfare are considered condoned. Formerly even claims
for reparation of damages caused by such acts could not
be raised after the conclusion of peace, unless the contrary
was expressly stipulated, but the matter is different
now in accordance with article 3 of Convention IV.
of the Second Peace Conference.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> On the other hand,
the amnesty has nothing to do with ordinary crimes
or with debts incurred during war. A prisoner of war
who commits murder during captivity may be tried and
punished after the conclusion of peace, just as a prisoner
who runs into debt during captivity may be sued after
the conclusion of peace, or an action may be brought on
ransom bills after peace has been restored.</p>

effective in regard to the other party to the war. For instance, the
occupant of enemy territory may not, after the conclusion of peace,
punish war criminals. Nothing, however, prevents a belligerent from
punishing members of his own forces or any of his own subjects who
during war committed violations of the laws of war, <i>e.g.</i> killed
wounded enemy soldiers and the like.</p></div>

of the Boer Forces in the Field"&mdash;see <i>Parliamentary Papers</i>, South
Africa, 1902, Cd. 1096&mdash;seems to contradict this assertion, as it
expressly excludes from the amnesty "certain acts, contrary to usages of
war, which have been notified by the Commander-in-Chief to the Boer
Generals, and which shall be tried by court-martial immediately after
the close of hostilities." But it will be remembered&mdash;see
 above, § <a href="#Footnote_500_500">265, p. 327, note 1</a>&mdash;that the agreement embodying these terms of surrender
does not bear the character of a treaty of peace, the Boer War having
been terminated through subjugation.</p></div>

<p>But it is important to remember here again that the
amnesty grants immunity only for wrongful acts done
by the subjects of one belligerent against the other.
Such wrongful acts as have been committed by the
subjects of a belligerent against their own Government
are not covered by the amnesty. Therefore treason,
desertion, and the like committed during the war by
his own subjects may be punished by a belligerent
after the conclusion of peace, unless the contrary has
been expressly stipulated in the treaty of peace.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p>§ 275. <a name="A_very_important275" id="A_very_important275"></a>A very important effect of a treaty of peace
is termination of the captivity of prisoners of war.<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
This, however, does not mean that with the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of peace all prisoners of war must at once be released.
It only means&mdash;to use the words of article 20 of the
Hague Regulations&mdash;that "After the conclusion of
peace, the repatriation of prisoners of war shall take
place as speedily as possible." The instant release of
prisoners at the very place where they were detained,
would be inconvenient not only for the State which
kept them in captivity, but also for themselves, as in
most cases they would not possess means to pay for
their journey home. Therefore, although with the
conclusion of peace they cease to be captives in the
technical sense of the term, prisoners of war remain
as a body under military discipline until they are
brought to the frontier and handed over to their Government.
That prisoners of war may be detained after
the conclusion of peace until they have paid debts incurred
during captivity seems to be an almost generally<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
recognised rule. But it is controversial whether such
prisoners of war may be detained as are undergoing a
term of imprisonment imposed upon them for offences
against discipline. After the Franco-German War in
1871 Germany detained such prisoners,<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> whereas Japan
after the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 released them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Revival of Treaties.</p></div>

<p>§ 276. The question how far a peace treaty has
the effect of reviving treaties concluded between the
parties before the outbreak of war is much controverted.
The answer depends upon the other question,
how far the outbreak of war cancels existing treaties
between belligerents.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> There can be no doubt that all
such treaties as have been cancelled by the outbreak of
war do not revive. On the other hand, there can
likewise be no doubt that such treaties as have only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
become suspended by the outbreak of war do revive.
But no certainty or unanimity exists regarding such
treaties as do not belong to the above two classes, and
it must, therefore, be emphasised that no rule of International
Law exists concerning these treaties. It is
for the parties to make such special stipulations in the
peace treaty as will settle the matter.</p>

Peace,
how to be
carried
out.</p></div>

<p>§ 277. The general rule, that treaties must be
performed in good faith, applies to peace treaties as
well as to others. The great importance, however,
of a treaty of peace and its special circumstances and
conditions make it necessary to draw attention to some
points connected with the performance of treaties of
peace. Occupied territory may have to be evacuated,
a war indemnity to be paid in cash, boundary lines of
ceded territory may have to be drawn, and many other
tasks performed. These tasks often necessitate the
conclusion of numerous treaties for the purpose of
performing details of the peace treaty concerned, and
the appointment of commissioners who meet in conference
to inquire into details and prepare a compromise.
Difficulties may arise in regard to the interpretation<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
of certain stipulations of the peace treaty
which arbitration will settle if the parties cannot agree.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_519_519" id="Footnote_519_519"></a><a href="#FNanchor_519_519">

<p>Arrangements may have to be made for the case in
which a part or the whole of the territory occupied
during the war remains, according to the peace treaty,
for some period under military occupation, such occupation
to serve as a means of securing the performance
of the peace treaty.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> One can form an idea of the
numerous points of importance to be dealt with during
the performance of a treaty of peace if one takes into
consideration the fact that, after the Franco-German
War was terminated in 1871 by the Peace of Frankfort,
more than a hundred Conventions were successively
concluded between the parties for the purpose of carrying
out this treaty of peace.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_520_520" id="Footnote_520_520"></a><a href="#FNanchor_520_520">

<div class="sidenote"><p>Breach of
Treaty of
Peace.</p></div>

<p>§ 278. Just as is the performance, so is the breach
of peace treaties of great importance. A peace treaty
can be violated in its entirety or in one of its stipulations
only. Violation by one of the parties does not
<i>ipso facto</i> cancel the treaty, but the other party may
cancel it on the ground of violation. Just as in connection
with violation of treaties in general, so in
violations of treaties of peace, some publicists maintain
that a distinction must be drawn between essential
and non-essential stipulations, and that violation of
essential stipulations only creates a right of cancelling
the treaty of peace. It has been shown
above,<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#Vi547"> Vol. I. § 547</a>, that the majority of publicists rightly oppose
the distinction.</p>

<p>But a distinction must be made between violation
during the period in which the conditions of the peace
treaty have to be fulfilled, and violation after such
period. In the first case, the other party may at once
recommence hostilities, the war being considered not
to have terminated through the violated peace treaty.
The second case, which might happen soon or several
years after the period for the fulfilment of the peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
conditions, is in no way different from violation of any
treaty in general. And if a party cancels the peace
treaty and wages war against the offender who violated
it, this war is a new war, and in no way a continuation
of the previous war which was terminated by the
violated treaty of peace. It must, however, be specially
observed that, just as in case of violation of a treaty in
general, so in case of violation of a peace treaty, the
offended party who wants to cancel the treaty on the
ground of its violation must do this in reasonable time
after the violation has taken place, otherwise the treaty
remains valid, or at least the non-violated parts of it.
A mere protest neither constitutes a cancellation nor
reserves the right of cancellation.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception of Postliminium.</p></div>

<p>§ 279. The term "postliminium" is originally one
of Roman Law derived from <i>post</i> and <i>limen</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
boundary). According to Roman Law the relations
of Rome with a foreign State depended upon the
fact whether or not a treaty of friendship<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> existed.
If such a treaty was not in existence, Romans entering
the foreign State concerned could be enslaved, and
Roman goods taken there could be appropriated.
Now, <i>jus postliminii</i> denoted the rule, firstly, that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
an enslaved Roman, should he ever return into the
territory of the Roman Empire, became <i>ipso facto</i> a
Roman citizen again with all the rights he possessed
previous to his capture, and, secondly, that Roman
property, appropriated after entry into the territory of a
foreign State, should at once upon being taken back
into the territory of the Roman Empire <i>ipso facto</i> revert
to its former Roman owner. Modern International and
Municipal Law have adopted the term for the purpose
of indicating the fact that territory, individuals, and
property, after having come in time of war under the
sway of the enemy, return either during the war or
with the end of the war under the sway of their original
Sovereign. This can occur in different ways. An
occupied territory can voluntarily be evacuated by the
enemy and then at once be reoccupied by the owner.
Or it can be reconquered by the legitimate Sovereign.
Or it can be reconquered by a third party and restored
to its legitimate owner. Conquered territory can also
be freed through a successful levy <i>en masse</i>. Property
seized by the enemy can be retaken, but it can also be
abandoned by the enemy and subsequently revert to
the belligerent from whom it was taken. And, further,
conquered territory can in consequence of a treaty of
peace be restored to its legitimate Sovereign. In all
cases concerned, the question has to be answered what
legal effects the postliminium has in regard to the
territory, the individuals thereon, or the property concerned.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_522_522" id="Footnote_522_522"></a><a href="#FNanchor_522_522"><span class="label">[522]</span></a> See
 above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#To40">vol. I. § 40</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Postliminium according to International Law, in
contradistinction to Postliminium according to Municipal Law.</p></div>

<p>§ 280. Most writers confound the effects of postliminium
according to Municipal Law with those
according to International Law. For instance:
whether a private ship which is recaptured reverts
<i>ipso facto</i> to its former owner;<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> whether the former laws
of a reconquered State revive <i>ipso facto</i> by the reconquest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
whether sentences passed on criminals during
the time of an occupation by the enemy should be
annulled&mdash;these and many similar questions treated
in books on International Law have nothing at all to do
with International Law, but have to be answered exclusively
by the Municipal Law of the respective States.
International Law can deal only with such effects of
postliminium as are international. These international
effects of postliminium may be grouped under the
following heads: revival of the former condition of
things, validity of legitimate acts, invalidity of illegitimate
acts.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_523_523" id="Footnote_523_523"></a><a href="#FNanchor_523_523"><span class="label">[523]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#A_prize_is_lost196">196</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Revival of the Former Condition of Things.</p></div>

<p>§ 281. Although a territory and the individuals
thereon come through military occupation in war
under the actual sway of the enemy, neither such
territory nor such individuals, according to the rules of
International Law of our times, fall under the sovereignty
of the invader. They rather remain, if not acquired by
the conqueror through subjugation, under the sovereignty
of the other belligerent, although the latter is in
fact prevented from exercising his supremacy over them.
Now, the moment the invader voluntarily evacuates
such territory, or is driven away by a levy <i>en masse</i>,
or by troops of the other belligerent or of his ally,
the former condition of things <i>ipso facto</i> revives; the
territory and individuals concerned being at once, so
far as International Law is concerned, considered to
be again under the sway of their legitimate Sovereign.
For all events of international importance taking
place on such territory the legitimate Sovereign is
again responsible towards third States, whereas during
the time of occupation the occupant was responsible
for such events.</p>

<p>But it must be specially observed that the case in
which the occupant of a territory is driven out of it
by the forces of a third State not allied with the legitimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Sovereign of such territory is not a case of postliminium,
and that consequently the former state of
things does not revive, unless the new occupant hands
the territory over to the legitimate Sovereign. If this
is not done, the military occupation of the new occupant
takes the place of that of the previous occupant.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Validity
of Legitimate
Acts.</p></div>

<p>§ 282. Postliminium has no effect upon such acts
of the former military occupant connected with the
occupied territory and the individuals and property
thereon as were legitimate acts of warfare. On the
contrary, the State into whose possession such territory
has reverted must recognise all such legitimate acts of
the former occupant, and the latter has by International
Law a right to demand such recognition. Therefore,
if the occupant has collected the ordinary taxes, has
sold the ordinary fruits of immoveable property, has
disposed of such moveable state property as he was
competent to appropriate, or has performed other acts
in conformity with the laws of war, this may not be
ignored by the legitimate Sovereign after he has again
taken possession of the territory.</p>

<p>However, only those consequences of such acts
must be recognised which have occurred during the
occupation. A case which illustrates this happened
after the Franco-German War. In October 1870,
during occupation by German troops of the <i>Départements
de la Meuse</i> and <i>de la Meurthe</i>, a Berlin firm entered
into a contract with the German Government to fell
15,000 oak trees in the State forests of these <i>départements</i>,
paying in advance £2250. The Berlin firm sold the
contract rights to others, who felled 9000 trees and sold,
in March 1871, their right to fell the remaining 6000
trees to a third party. The last-named felled a part
of these trees during the German occupation, but,
when the French Government again took possession
of the territory concerned, the contractors were without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
indemnity prevented from further felling of trees.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
The question whether the Germans had a right at all
to enter into the contract is doubtful. But even if
they had such right, it covered the felling of trees during
their occupation only, and not afterwards.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_524_524" id="Footnote_524_524"></a><a href="#FNanchor_524_524"><span class="label">[524]</span></a> The Protocol of Signature added to the Additional
Convention to the Peace Treaty of Frankfort, signed on December 11,
1871&mdash;see Martens, <i>N.R.G.</i> XX. p. 868&mdash;comprises a declaration stating
the fact that the French Government does not recognise any liability to
pay indemnities to the contractors concerned.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Invalidity of Illegitimate Acts.</p></div>

<p>§ 283. <a name="If_the_occupant283" id="If_the_occupant283"></a>If the occupant has performed acts which are
not legitimate acts of warfare, postliminium makes
their invalidity apparent. Therefore, if the occupant
has sold immoveable State property, such property
may afterwards be claimed from the acquirer, whoever
he is, without any indemnity. If he has given office
to individuals, they may afterwards be dismissed. If
he has appropriated and sold such private or public
property as may not legitimately be appropriated by a
military occupant, it may afterwards be claimed from
the acquirer without payment of damages.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>No Postliminium
after
Interregnum.</p></div>

<p>§ 284. Cases of postliminium occur only when a conquered
territory comes either during or at the end
of the war again into the possession of the legitimate
Sovereign. No case of postliminium arises when a
territory, ceded to the enemy by the treaty of peace
or conquered and annexed without cession at the end
of a war which was terminated through simple cessation
of hostilities,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> later on reverts to its former owner State,
or when the whole of the territory of a State which was
conquered and subjugated regains its liberty and becomes
again the territory of an independent State.
Such territory has actually been under the sovereignty
of the conqueror; the period between the conquest and
the revival of the previous condition of things was not
one of mere military occupation during war, but one of
interregnum during time of peace, and therefore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
revival of the former condition of things is not a case
of postliminium. An illustrative instance of this is
furnished by the case of the domains of the Electorate
of Hesse-Cassel.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> This hitherto independent State was
subjugated in 1806 by Napoleon and became in 1807
part of the Kingdom of Westphalia constituted by
Napoleon for his brother Jerome, who governed it up
to the end of 1813, when, with the downfall of Napoleon,
the Kingdom of Westphalia fell to pieces and the former
Elector of Hesse-Cassel was reinstated. Jerome had
during his reign sold many of the domains of Hesse-Cassel.
The Elector, however, on his return, did not
recognise these contracts, but deprived the owners of
their property without indemnification, maintaining
that a case of postliminium had arisen, and that Jerome
had no right to sell the domains. The Courts of the
Electorate pronounced against the Elector, denying
that a case of postliminium had arisen, since Jerome,
although a usurper, had been King of Westphalia during
an interregnum, and since the sale of the domains was
therefore no wrongful act. But the Elector, who was
absolute in the Electorate, did not comply with the
verdict of his own courts, and the Vienna Congress,
which was approached in the matter by the unfortunate
proprietors of the domains, refused its intervention,
although Prussia strongly took their part. It is generally
recognised by all writers on International Law that
this case was not one of postliminium, and the attitude
of the Elector cannot therefore be defended by appeal
to International Law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality not practised in Ancient Times.</p></div>

<p>§ 285. Since in antiquity there was no notion of
an International Law,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> it is not to be expected that
neutrality as a legal institution should have existed
among the nations of old. Neutrality did not exist
even in practice, for belligerents never recognised an
attitude of impartiality on the part of other States.
If war broke out between two nations, third parties
had to choose between the belligerents and become
allies or enemies of one or other. This does not mean
that third parties had actually to take part in the
fighting. Nothing of the kind was the case. But they
had, if necessary, to render assistance; for example,
to allow the passage of belligerent forces through their
country, to supply provisions and the like to the party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
they favoured, and to deny all such assistance to the
enemy. Several instances are known of efforts<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> on
the part of third parties to take up an attitude of
impartiality, but belligerents never recognised such
impartiality.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality during the Middle Ages.</p></div>

<p>§ 286. During the Middle Ages matters changed in
so far only as, in the latter part of this period, belligerents
did not exactly force third parties to a choice;
but legal duties and rights connected with neutrality
did not exist. A State could maintain that it was no
party to a war, although it furnished one of the belligerents
with money, troops, and other kinds of assistance.
To prevent such assistance, which was in no
way considered illegal, treaties were frequently concluded,
during the latter part of the Middle Ages, for
the purpose of specially stipulating that the parties
were not to assist each other's enemies in any way
during time of war, and were to prevent their subjects
from rendering such assistance. Through the influence
of such treaties the difference between a really and
feigned impartial attitude of third States during war
became recognised, and neutrality, as an institution
of International Law, gradually developed during the
sixteenth century.</p>

<p>Of great importance was the fact that the Swiss
Confederation, in contradistinction to her policy during
former times, made it a matter of policy from the end
of the sixteenth century always to remain neutral
during wars between other States. Although this
former neutrality of the Swiss can in no way be compared
with modern neutrality, since Swiss mercenaries
for centuries afterwards fought in all European wars,
the Swiss Government itself succeeded in each instance
in taking up and preserving such an attitude of impartiality
as complied with the current rules of neutrality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p>It should be mentioned that the collection of rules
and customs regarding Maritime Law which goes under
the name of <i>Consolato del Mare</i> made its appearance
about the middle of the fourteenth century. One of
the rules there laid down, that in time of war enemy
goods on neutral vessels may be confiscated, but that,
on the other hand, neutral goods on enemy vessels
must be restored, became of great importance, since
Great Britain acted accordingly from the beginning of
the eighteenth century until the outbreak of the Crimean
War in 1854.<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_529_529" id="Footnote_529_529"></a><a href="#FNanchor_529_529"><span class="label">[529]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality during the Seventeenth Century.</p></div>

<p>§ 287. At the time of Grotius, neutrality was recognised
as an institution of International Law, although
such institution was in its infancy only and
needed a long time to reach its present range. Grotius
did not know, or at any rate did not make use of, the
term neutrality.<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> He treats neutrality in the very
short seventeenth chapter of the Third Book on the
Law of War and Peace, under the head <i>De his, qui in bello
medii sunt</i>, and establishes in § 3 two doubtful rules
only. The first is that neutrals shall do nothing which
may strengthen a belligerent whose cause is unjust, or
which may hinder the movements of a belligerent whose
cause is just. The second rule is that in a war in which
it is doubtful whose cause is just, neutrals shall treat
both belligerents alike, in permitting the passage of
troops, in supplying provisions for the troops, and in
not rendering assistance to persons besieged.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_530_530" id="Footnote_530_530"></a><a href="#FNanchor_530_530"><span class="label">[530]</span></a> That the term was known at the time of Grotius may be
inferred from the fact that Neumayr de Ramsla in 1620 published his work
<i>Von der Neutralität und Assistenz ... in Kriegszeiten</i>; see Nys in
<i>R.I.</i> XVII. (1885), p. 78.</p></div>

<p>The treatment of neutrality by Grotius shows, on
the one hand, that apart from the recognition of the
fact that third parties could remain neutral, not many
rules regarding the duties of neutrals existed, and, on
the other hand, that the granting of passage to troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
of belligerents and the supply of provisions to them
was not considered illegal. And the practice of the
seventeenth century furnishes numerous instances of
the fact that neutrality was not really an attitude
of impartiality, and that belligerents did not respect
the territories of neutral States. Thus, although
Charles I. remained neutral, the Marquis of Hamilton
and six thousand British soldiers were fighting in 1631
under Gustavus Adolphus. "In 1626 the English
captured a French ship in Dutch waters. In 1631 the
Spaniards attacked the Dutch in a Danish port; in
1639 the Dutch were in turn the aggressors, and attacked
the Spanish Fleet in English waters; again, in 1666
they captured English vessels in the Elbe...; in
1665 an English fleet endeavoured to seize the Dutch
East India Squadron in the harbour of Bergen, but
were beaten off with the help of the forts; finally, in
1693, the French attempted to cut some Dutch ships
out of Lisbon, and on being prevented by the guns of
the place from carrying them off, burnt them in the
river."<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Progress of Neutrality during the Eighteenth Century.</p></div>

<p>§ 288. <a name="It_was_not_until288" id="It_was_not_until288"></a>It was not until the eighteenth century
that theory and practice agreed upon the duty of
neutrals to remain impartial, and the duty of belligerents
to respect the territories of neutrals. Bynkershoek
and Vattel formulated adequate conceptions
of neutrality. Bynkershoek<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> does not use the term
"neutrality," but calls neutrals <i>non hostes</i>, and he
describes them as those who are of neither party&mdash;<i>qui
neutrarum partium sunt</i>&mdash;in a war, and who do not,
in accordance with a treaty, give assistance to either
party. Vattel (III. § 103), on the other hand, makes
use of the term "neutrality," and gives the following
definition:&mdash;"Neutral nations, during a war, are those
who take no one's part, remaining friends common to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
both parties, and not favouring the armies of one of
them to the prejudice of the other." But although
Vattel's book appeared in 1758, twenty-one years
after that of Bynkershoek, his doctrines are in some
ways less advanced than those of Bynkershoek. The
latter, in contradistinction to Grotius, maintained that
neutrals had nothing to do with the question as to
which party to a war had a just cause; that neutrals,
being friends to both parties, have not to sit as judges
between these parties, and, consequently, must not
give or deny to one or other party more or less in
accordance with their conviction as to the justice or
injustice of the cause of each. Vattel, however, teaches
(III. § 135) that a neutral, although he may generally
allow the passage of troops of the belligerents through
his territory, may refuse this passage to such belligerent
as is making war for an unjust cause.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_532_532" id="Footnote_532_532"></a><a href="#FNanchor_532_532"><span class="label">[532]</span></a> <i>Quaest. jur. publ.</i> I. c. 9.</p></div>

<p>Although the theory and practice of the eighteenth
century agreed upon the duty of neutrals to remain
impartial, the impartiality demanded was not at all
a strict one. For, firstly, throughout the greater part
of the century a State was considered not to violate
neutrality in case it furnished one of the belligerents
with such limited assistance as it had previously
promised by treaty.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> In this way troops could be
supplied by a neutral to a belligerent, and passage
through neutral territory could be granted to his
forces. And, secondly, the possibility existed for
either belligerent to make use of the resources of
neutrals. It was not considered a breach of neutrality
on the part of a State to allow one or both belligerents
to levy troops on its territory, or to grant Letters of
Marque to vessels belonging to its commercial fleet.
During the second half of the eighteenth century, theory
and practice became aware of the fact that neutrality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
was not consistent with these and other indulgences.
But this only led to the distinction between neutrality
in the strict sense of the term and an imperfect neutrality.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_533_533" id="Footnote_533_533"></a><a href="#FNanchor_533_533"><span class="label">[533]</span></a> See examples in Hall, § 211.</p></div>

<p>As regards the duty of belligerents to respect neutral
territory, progress was also made in the eighteenth
century. Whenever neutral territory was violated, reparation
was asked and made. But it was considered
lawful for the victor to pursue the vanquished army
into neutral territory, and, likewise, for a fleet to pursue<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
the defeated enemy fleet into neutral territorial waters.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>First Armed Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 289. <a name="Whereas_on_the_whole289" id="Whereas_on_the_whole289"></a>Whereas, on the whole, the duty of neutrals
to remain impartial and the duty of belligerents to
respect neutral territory became generally recognised
during the eighteenth century, the members of the
Family of Nations did not come to an agreement during
this period regarding the treatment of neutral vessels
trading with belligerents. It is true that the right of
visit and search for contraband of war and the right to
seize the latter was generally recognised, but in other
respects no general theory and practice was agreed
upon. France and Spain upheld the rule that neutral
goods on enemy ships as well as neutral ships carrying
enemy goods could be seized by belligerents. Although
England granted from time to time, by special treaties
with special States, the rule "Free ship, free goods,"
her general practice throughout the eighteenth century
followed the rule of the <i>Consolato del Mare</i>, according
to which enemy goods on neutral vessels may be confiscated,
whereas neutral goods on enemy vessels must
be restored. England, further, upheld the principle
that the commerce of neutrals should in time of war
be restricted to the same limits as in time of peace, since
most States in time of peace reserved cabotage and
trade with their colonies to vessels of their own merchant
marine. It was in 1756 that this principle first came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
into question. In this year, during war with England,
France found that on account of the naval superiority
of England she was unable to carry on her colonial
trade by her own merchant marine, and she, therefore,
threw open this trade to vessels of the Netherlands,
which had remained neutral. England, however,
ordered her fleet to seize all such vessels with their
cargoes on the ground that they had become incorporated
with the French merchant marine, and had
thereby acquired enemy character. From this time
the above principle is commonly called the "rule<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>
of 1756." England, thirdly, followed other Powers in
the practice of declaring enemy coasts to be blockaded
and condemning captured neutral vessels for breach of
blockade, although the blockades were by no means
always effective.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_535_535" id="Footnote_535_535"></a><a href="#FNanchor_535_535"><span class="label">[535]</span></a> See Phillimore, III. §§ 212-222; Hall, § 234; Manning, pp.
260-267; Westlake, II. p. 254; Moore, VII. § 1180; Boeck, No. 52:
Dupuis, Nos. 131-133. Stress must be laid on the fact that the original
meaning of the rule of 1756 is different from the meaning it received by
its extension in 1793. From that year onwards England not only
considered those neutral vessels which embarked upon the French coasting
and colonial trade thrown open to them during the war with England, as
having acquired enemy character, but likewise those neutral vessels
which carried neutral goods from neutral ports to ports of a French
colony. This extension of the rule of 1756 was clearly unjustified, and
it is not possible to believe that it will ever be revived.</p></div>

<p>As privateering was legitimate and in general
use, neutral commerce was considerably disturbed
during every war between naval States. Now in 1780,
during war between Great Britain, her American
colonies, France, and Spain, Russia sent a circular<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
to England, France, and Spain, in which she proclaimed
the following five principles: (1) That neutral
vessels should be allowed to navigate from port to port
of belligerents and along their coasts; (2) that enemy
goods on neutral vessels, contraband excepted, should
not be seized by belligerents; (3) that, with regard to
contraband, articles 10 and 11 of the treaty of 1766<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
between Russia and Great Britain should be applied in
all cases; (4) that a port should only be considered
blockaded if the blockading belligerent had stationed
vessels there, so as to create an obvious danger for
neutral vessels entering the port; (5) that these principles
should be applied in the proceedings and judgments
on the legality of prizes. In July and August
1780, Russia<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> entered into a treaty, first with Denmark
and then with Sweden, for the purpose of enforcing
those principles by equipping a number of men-of-war.
Thus the "Armed Neutrality" made its appearance.
In 1781, the Netherlands, Prussia, and Austria, in 1782
Portugal, and in 1783 the Two Sicilies joined the league.
France, Spain, and the United States of America accepted
the principles of the league without formally
joining. The war between England, the United States,
France, and Spain was terminated in 1783, and the war
between England and the Netherlands in 1784, but in
the treaties of peace the principles of the "Armed
Neutrality" were not mentioned. This league had no
direct practical consequences, since England retained
her former standpoint. Moreover, some of the States
that had joined the league acted contrary to some of
its principles when they themselves went to war&mdash;as
did Sweden during her war with Russia 1788-1790, and
France and Russia in 1793&mdash;and some of them concluded
treaties in which were stipulations at variance
with those principles. Nevertheless, the First Armed
Neutrality has proved of great importance, because its
principles have furnished the basis of the Declaration
of Paris of 1856.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The French Revolution and the Second Armed Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 290. <a name="The_wars_of_the_French_Revolution290" id="The_wars_of_the_French_Revolution290"></a>The wars of the French Revolution showed
that the time was not yet ripe for the progress aimed
at by the First Armed Neutrality. Russia, the very
same Power which had initiated the Armed Neutrality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
in 1780 under the Empress Catharine II. (1762-1796),
joined Great Britain in 1793 in order to interdict all
neutral navigation into ports of France, with the intention
of subduing France by famine. Russia and
England justified their attitude by the exceptional
character of their war against France, which country
had proved to be the enemy of the security of all other
nations. The French Convention answered with an
order to the French fleet to capture all neutral ships
carrying provisions to enemy ports or carrying enemy
goods.</p>

<p>But although Russia herself had acted in defiance
of the principles of the First Armed Neutrality, she
called a second into existence in 1800, during the
reign of the Emperor Paul. The Second Armed
Neutrality was caused by the refusal of England to
concede immunity from visit and search to neutral
merchantmen under convoy.<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Sweden was the first
to claim in 1653, during war between Holland and
Great Britain, that the belligerents should not visit
and search Swedish merchantmen under convoy of
Swedish men-of-war, provided a declaration was made
by the men-of-war that the merchantmen had no
contraband on board. Other States later raised the
same claim, and many treaties were concluded which
stipulated the immunity from visit and search of neutral
merchantmen under convoy. But Great Britain refused
to recognise the principle, and when, in July 1800, a
British squadron captured a Danish man-of-war and
her convoy of several merchantmen for having resisted
visit and search, Russia invited Sweden, Denmark, and
Prussia to renew the "Armed Neutrality," and to add
to its principles the further one, that belligerents should
not have a right of visit and search in case the commanding
officer of the man-of-war, under whose convoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
neutral merchantmen were sailing, should declare that
the convoyed vessels did not carry contraband of war.
In December 1800 Russia concluded treaties with
Sweden, Denmark, and Prussia consecutively, by
which the "Second Armed Neutrality" became a fact.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
But it lasted only a year on account of the assassination
of the Emperor Paul of Russia on March 23, and the
defeat of the Danish fleet by Nelson on April 2, 1801,
in the battle of Copenhagen. Nevertheless, the Second
Armed Neutrality likewise proved of importance, for it
led to a compromise in the "Maritime Convention"
concluded by England and Russia under the Emperor
Alexander I. on June 17, 1801, at St. Petersburg.<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
By article 3 of this treaty, England recognised, as far as
Russia was concerned, the rules that neutral vessels
might navigate from port to port and on the coasts
of belligerents, and that blockades must be effective.
But in the same article England enforced recognition by
Russia of the rule that enemy goods on neutral vessels
may be seized, and she did not recognise the immunity
of neutral vessels under convoy from visit and search,
although, by article 4, she conceded that the right of
visit and search should be exercised only by men-of-war,
and not by privateers, in case the neutral vessels concerned
sailed under convoy.</p>

<p>But this compromise did not last long. When in
November 1807 war broke out between Russia and
England, the former in her declaration of war<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> annulled
the Maritime Convention of 1801, proclaimed again
the principles of the First Armed Neutrality, and
asserted that she would never again drop these principles.
Great Britain proclaimed in her counter-declaration<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
her return to those principles against which the First
and the Second Armed Neutrality were directed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
she was able to point out that no Power had applied
these principles more severely than Russia under the
Empress Catharine II. after the latter had initiated the
First Armed Neutrality.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_541_541" id="Footnote_541_541"></a><a href="#FNanchor_541_541"><span class="label">[541]</span></a> Martens, <i>R.</i> VIII. p. 706.</p></div>

<p>Thus all progress made by the Maritime Convention
of 1801 fell to the ground. Times were not favourable
to any progress. After Napoleon's Berlin decrees in
1806 ordering the boycott of all English goods, England
declared all French ports and all the ports of the allies
of France blockaded, and ordered her fleet to capture
all ships destined to these ports. And Russia, which
had in her declaration of war against England in 1807
solemnly asserted that she would never again drop
the principles of the First Armed Neutrality, by
article 2 of the Ukase<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> published on August 1, 1809,
violated one of the most important of these principles
by ordering that neutral vessels carrying enemy
(English) goods were to be stopped, the enemy goods
seized, and the vessels themselves seized if more than
the half of their cargoes consisted of enemy goods.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality during the Nineteenth Century.</p></div>

<p>§ 291. <a name="The_development291" id="The_development291"></a>The development of the rules of neutrality
during the nineteenth century was due to four factors.</p>

<p>(1) The most prominent and influential factor is
the attitude of the United States of America towards
neutrality from 1793 to 1818. When in 1793 England
joined the war which had broken out in 1792 between
the so-called First Coalition and France, Genêt, the
French diplomatic envoy accredited to the United
States, granted Letters of Marque to American merchantmen
manned by American citizens in American
ports. These privateers were destined to cruise against
English vessels, and French Prize Courts were set up
by the French Minister in connection with French consulates
in American ports. On the complaint of Great
Britain, the Government of the United States ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
these privateers to be disarmed and the French Prize
Courts to be disorganised.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> As the trial of Gideon
Henfield,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> who was acquitted, proved that the Municipal
Law of the United States did not prohibit the
enlistment of American citizens in the service of a
foreign belligerent, Congress in 1794 passed an Act
temporarily forbidding American citizens to accept
Letters of Marque from a foreign belligerent and to
enlist in the army or navy of a foreign State, and forbidding
the fitting out and arming of vessels intended
as privateers for foreign belligerents. Other Acts were
passed from time to time. Finally, on April 20, 1818,
Congress passed the Foreign Enlistment Act, which
deals definitely with the matter, and is still in force,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
and which afforded the basis of the British Foreign
Enlistment Act of 1819. The example of the United
States initiated the present practice, according to
which it is the duty of neutrals to prevent the fitting
out and arming on their territory of cruisers for belligerents,
to prevent enlistment on their territory for
belligerents, and the like.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_544_544" id="Footnote_544_544"></a><a href="#FNanchor_544_544"><span class="label">[544]</span></a> See Wharton, III. §§ 395-396.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_545_545" id="Footnote_545_545"></a><a href="#FNanchor_545_545"><span class="label">[545]</span></a> Concerning this trial, see Taylor, § 609.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_546_546" id="Footnote_546_546"></a><a href="#FNanchor_546_546"><span class="label">[546]</span></a> See Wheaton, §§ 434-437; Taylor, § 610; Lawrence, § 223.</p></div>

<p>(2) Of great importance for the development of
neutrality during the nineteenth century became the
permanent neutralisation of Switzerland and Belgium.
These States naturally adopted and retained throughout
every war an exemplary attitude of impartiality
towards the belligerents. And each time war broke
out in their vicinity they took effectual military
measures for the purpose of preventing belligerents
from making use of their neutral territory and
resources.</p>

<p>(3) The third factor is the Declaration of Paris of
1856, which incorporated into International Law the
rule "Free ship, free goods," the rule that neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
goods on enemy ships cannot be appropriated, and
the rule that blockade must be effective.</p>

<p>(4) The fourth and last factor is the general development
of the military and naval resources of all
members of the Family of Nations. As all the larger
States were, during the second half of the nineteenth
century, obliged to keep their armies and navies at
every moment ready for war, it followed as a consequence
that, whenever war broke out, each belligerent
was anxious not to injure neutral States in order to
avoid their taking the part of the enemy. On the
other hand, neutral States were always anxious to
fulfil the duties of neutrality for fear of being drawn
into the war. Thus the general rule, that the development
of International Law has been fostered by the
interests of the members of the Family of Nations,
applies also to the special case of neutrality. But for
the fact that it is to the interest of belligerents to
remain during war on good terms with neutrals, and
that it is to the interest of neutrals not to be drawn
into war, the institution of neutrality would never have
developed so favourably as it actually did during the
nineteenth century.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality in the Twentieth Century.</p></div>

<p>§ 292. And this development has continued during
the first decade of the twentieth century. The South
African and Russo-Japanese wars produced several
incidents which gave occasion for the Second Peace
Conference of 1907 to take the matter of neutrality
within the range of its deliberations and to agree upon
the Convention (V.) concerning the rights and duties of
neutral Powers and persons in war on land, as well as
upon the Convention (XIII.) concerning the rights and
duties of neutral Powers in maritime war. And some
of the other Conventions agreed upon at this Conference,
although they do not directly concern neutral Powers,
are indirectly of great importance to them. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Convention (VII.) respecting the conversion of merchantmen
into men-of-war indirectly concerns neutral
trade as well as the Convention (VIII.) respecting the
laying of submarine mines, and the Convention (XI.)
concerning restrictions on the exercise of the right of
capture. Of the greatest importance, however, is the
fact that by the as yet unratified Convention XII. the
Conference agreed upon the establishment of an International
Prize Court to serve as a Court of Appeal in
such prize cases decided by the Prize Courts of either
belligerent as concern the interests of neutral Powers or
their subjects. To enable this proposed Court to find
its verdicts on the basis of a generally accepted prize
law the Naval Conference of London met in 1908 and
produced, in 1909, the Declaration of London concerning
the laws of naval war, which represents a code
comprising the rules respecting blockade, contraband,
unneutral service, destruction of neutral prizes, transfer
to neutral flag, enemy character, convoy, resistance to
search, and compensation. Although the Declaration
of London has been signed by only ten Powers, none
of which has as yet ratified,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> there is no doubt that
sooner or later, perhaps with some slight modifications,
it will either be <i>expressly</i> ratified, or become customary
law by the fact that maritime Powers which go to war
will carry out its rules.<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> Be that as it may, the Declaration
of London is a document of epoch-making
character and the future historian of International Law
will reckon its development from the Declaration of
Paris (1856) to the Declaration of London<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> (1909).</p>

Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 293. <a name="Such_States293" id="Such_States293"></a>Such States as do not take part in a war
between other States are neutrals.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> The term
"neutrality" is derived from the Latin <i>neuter</i>. Neutrality
may be defined as <i>the attitude of impartiality
adopted by third States towards belligerents and recognised
by belligerents, such attitude creating rights and duties
between the impartial States and the belligerents</i>. Whether
or not a third State will adopt and preserve an attitude
of impartiality during war is not a matter for International
Law but for International Politics. Therefore,
unless a previous treaty stipulates it expressly, no duty
exists for a State, according to International Law, to
remain neutral in war. On the other hand, it ought
not to be maintained, although this is done by some
writers,<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> that every State has by the Law of Nations a
right not to remain neutral. The fact is that every
Sovereign State, as an independent member of the
Family of Nations, is master of its own resolutions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
that the question of remaining neutral or not is, in
absence of a treaty stipulating otherwise, one of policy
and not of law. However, all States which do not
expressly declare the contrary by word or action, are
supposed to be neutral, and the rights and duties
arising from neutrality come into and remain in
existence through the mere fact that a State takes up
and preserves an attitude of impartiality and is not
drawn into the war by the belligerents themselves. A
special assertion of intention to remain neutral is not
therefore legally necessary on the part of neutral States,
although they often expressly and formally proclaim<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>
their neutrality.</p>

 below, § <a href="#Neutrality_being309">309</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality an Attitude of Impartiality.</p></div>

<p>§ 294. Since neutrality is an attitude of impartiality,
it excludes such assistance and succour to one
of the belligerents as is detrimental to the other, and,
further, such injuries to the one as benefit the other.
But it requires, on the other hand, active measures
from neutral States. For neutrals must prevent belligerents
from making use of their neutral territories
and of their resources for military and naval purposes
during the war. This concerns not only actual fighting
on neutral territories, but also transport of troops,
war materials, and provisions for the troops, the fitting
out of men-of-war and privateers, the activity of Prize
Courts, and the like.</p>

<p>But it is important to remember that the necessary
attitude of impartiality is not incompatible with
sympathy with one and antipathy against the other
belligerent, so long as such sympathy and antipathy
are not realised in actions violating impartiality.
Thus, not only public opinion and the Press of a neutral
State, but also the Government,<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> may show their sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
to one party or another without thereby violating
neutrality. And it must likewise be specially observed
that acts of humanity on the part of neutrals and their
subjects, such as the sending of doctors, medicine, provisions,
dressing material, and the like, to military
hospitals, and the sending of clothes and money to
prisoners of war, can never be construed as acts of
partiality, although these comforts are provided for
the wounded and the prisoners of one of the belligerents
only.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_553_553" id="Footnote_553_553"></a><a href="#FNanchor_553_553"><span class="label">[553]</span></a> See, however, Geffcken in Holtzendorff, IV. p. 656, and
Frankenbach, <i>Die Rechtsstellung von neutralen Staatsangehörigen in

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality an Attitude creating Rights and Duties.</p></div>

<p>§ 295. Since neutrality is an attitude during the
condition of war only, this attitude calls into existence
special rights and duties which do not generally
obtain. They come into existence by the fact that the
outbreak of war has been notified or has otherwise<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
unmistakably become known to third States who take
up an attitude of impartiality, and they expire <i>ipso
facto</i> by the termination of the war.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_554_554" id="Footnote_554_554"></a><a href="#FNanchor_554_554"><span class="label">[554]</span></a> See article 2 of Convention III. of the Second Peace
Conference.</p></div>

<p>Rights and duties deriving from neutrality do not
exist before the outbreak of war, although such outbreak
may be expected every moment. Even so-called
neutralised States, as Switzerland and Belgium, have
during time of peace no duties connected with neutrality,
although as neutralised States they have even in time
of peace certain duties. These duties are not duties
connected with neutrality, but duties imposed upon
the neutralised States as a condition of their neutralisation.
They include restrictions for the purpose of safeguarding
the neutralised States from being drawn into
war.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality an Attitude of States.</p></div>

<p>§ 296. <a name="As_International_Law296" id="As_International_Law296"></a>As International Law is a law between
States only and exclusively, neutrality is an attitude
of impartiality on the part of States, and not on the
part of individuals.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Individuals derive neither rights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
nor duties, according to International Law, from the
neutrality of those States whose subjects they are.
Neutral States are indeed obliged by International Law
to prevent their subjects from committing certain acts,
but the duty of these subjects to comply with such
injunctions of their Sovereigns is a duty imposed upon
them by Municipal, not by International Law. Belligerents,
on the other hand, are indeed permitted by
International Law to punish subjects of neutrals for
breach of blockade, for carriage of contraband and for
rendering unneutral service to the enemy; but the
duty of subjects of neutrals to comply with these
injunctions of belligerents is a duty imposed upon them
by these very injunctions of the belligerents, and not by
International Law. Although as a rule a State has
no jurisdiction over foreign subjects on the Open Sea,<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>
either belligerent has, exceptionally, by International
Law, the right to punish foreign subjects by confiscation
of cargo, and eventually of the vessel itself, in
case their vessels break blockade, carry contraband, or
render unneutral service to the enemy; but punishment
is threatened and executed by the belligerents,
not by International Law. Therefore, if neutral merchantmen
commit such acts, they neither violate
neutrality nor do they act against International Law,
but they simply violate injunctions of the belligerents
concerned. If they choose to run the risk of punishment
in the form of losing their property, this is their
own concern, and their neutral home State need not
prevent them from doing so. But to the right of
belligerents to punish subjects of neutrals for the acts
specified corresponds the duty of neutral States to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
acquiesce on their part in the exercise of this right by
either belligerent.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_556_556" id="Footnote_556_556"></a><a href="#FNanchor_556_556"><span class="label">[556]</span></a> It should be specially observed that it is an inaccuracy of
language to speak (as is commonly done in certain cases) of individuals
as being neutral. Thus, article 16 of Convention V. of the Second Peace
Conference designates the nationals of a State which is not taking part
in a war as "neutrals." Thus, further, belligerents occupying enemy
territory frequently make enemy individuals who are not members of the
armed forces of the enemy take a so-called oath of neutrality.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_557_557" id="Footnote_557_557"></a><a href="#FNanchor_557_557"><span class="label">[557]</span></a> See

<p>Moreover, apart from carriage of contraband, breach
of blockade, and unneutral service to the enemy, which
a belligerent may punish by capturing and confiscating
the vessels or goods concerned, subjects of neutrals are
perfectly unhindered in their movements, and neutral
States have in especial no duty to prevent their subjects
from selling arms, munitions, and provisions to
a belligerent, from enlisting in his forces, and the like.</p>

involves the duty of abstaining from assisting either
belligerent either actively or passively, but it does not
include the duty of breaking off all intercourse with the
belligerents. Apart from certain restrictions necessitated
by impartiality, all intercourse between belligerents
and neutrals takes place as before, a condition
of peace prevailing between them in spite of the war
between the belligerents. This applies particularly to
the working of treaties, to diplomatic intercourse, and
to trade. But indirectly, of course, the condition of
war between belligerents may have a disturbing influence
upon intercourse between belligerents and
neutrals. Thus the treaty-rights of a neutral State
may be interfered with through occupation of enemy
territory by a belligerent; its subjects living on such
territory bear in a sense enemy character; its subjects
trading with the belligerents are hampered by the right
of visit and search, and the right of the belligerents to
capture blockade-runners and contraband of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality an Attitude during War (Neutrality in Civil War).</p></div>

<p>§ 298. <a name="Since_neutrality298" id="Since_neutrality298"></a>Since neutrality is an attitude during war,
the question arises as to the necessary attitude of
foreign States during civil war. As civil war becomes
real war through recognition<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> of the insurgents as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
belligerent Power, a distinction must be made as to
whether recognition has taken place or not. There is no
doubt that a foreign State commits an international
delinquency by assisting insurgents in spite of its
being at peace with the legitimate Government. But
matters are different after recognition. The insurgents
are now a belligerent Power, and the civil war is now
real war. Foreign States can either become a party
to the war or remain neutral, and in the latter case
all duties and rights of neutrality devolve upon them.
Since, however, recognition may be granted by foreign
States independently of the attitude of the legitimate
Government, and since recognition granted by the
latter is not at all binding upon foreign Governments,
it may happen that insurgents are granted recognition
on the part of the legitimate Government, whereas
foreign States refuse it, and <i>vice versa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> In the first
case, the rights and duties of neutrality devolve upon
foreign States as far as the legitimate Government is
concerned. Men-of-war of the latter may visit and
search merchantmen of foreign States for contraband;
a blockade declared by the legitimate Government is
binding upon foreign States, and the like. But no
rights and duties of neutrality devolve upon foreign
States as regards the insurgents. A blockade declared
by them is not binding, their men-of-war may not
visit and search merchantmen for contraband. On
the other hand, if insurgents are recognised by a foreign
State but not by the legitimate Government, such
foreign State has all rights and duties of neutrality
so far as the insurgents are concerned, but not so
far as the legitimate Government is concerned.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
practice, however, recognition of insurgents on the
part of foreign States will, if really justified, always
have the effect of causing the legitimate Government
to grant its recognition also.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality to be recognised by the Belligerents.</p></div>

<p>§ 299. <a name="Just_as_third_States299" id="Just_as_third_States299"></a>Just as third States have no duty to remain
neutral in a war, so they have no right<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> to demand
that they be allowed to remain neutral. History
reports many cases in which States, although they
intended to remain neutral, were obliged by one or
both belligerents to make up their minds and choose
the belligerent with whom they would throw in their
lot. For neutrality to come into existence it is, therefore,
not sufficient for a third State at the outbreak of
war to take up an attitude of impartiality, but it is also
necessary that the belligerents recognise this attitude
by acquiescing in it and by not treating such third
State as a party to the war. This does not mean, as
has been maintained,<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> that neutrality is based on a
contract concluded either <i>expressis verbis</i> or by unmistakable
actions between the belligerents and third
States, and that, consequently, a third State might at
the outbreak of war take up the position of one which
is neither neutral nor a party to the war, reserving
thereby for itself freedom in its future resolutions and
actions. Since the normal relation between members of
the Family of Nations is peace, the outbreak of war
between some of the members causes the others to
become neutrals <i>ipso facto</i> by their taking up an attitude
of impartiality and by their not being treated by the
belligerents as parties to the war. Thus, it is not a
contract that calls neutrality into existence, but this
condition is rather a legal consequence of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
attitude on the part of third States at the outbreak of
war, on the one hand, and, on the other, on the part of
the belligerents themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Perpetual
Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 300. The very first distinction to be made between
different kinds of neutrality is that between perpetual
or other neutrality. Perpetual or permanent
is the neutrality of States which are neutralised by
special treaties of the members of the Family of Nations,
as at the present time that of Switzerland, Belgium, and
Luxemburg. Apart from duties arising from the fact of
their neutralisation which are to be performed in time
of peace as well as in time of war, the duties and rights
of neutrality are the same for neutralised as for other
States. It must be specially observed that this concerns
not only the obligation not to assist either belligerent,
but likewise the obligation to prevent them
from making use of the neutral territory for their
military purposes. Thus, Switzerland in 1870 and
1871, during the Franco-German War, properly prevented
the transport of troops, recruits, and war
material of either belligerent over her territory, disarmed
the French army which had saved itself by
crossing the Swiss frontier, and detained the members
of this army until the conclusion of peace.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_563_563" id="Footnote_563_563"></a><a href="#FNanchor_563_563"><span class="label">[563]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>General
and
Partial
Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 301. The distinction between general and partial
neutrality derives from the fact that a part of the
territory of a State may be neutralised,<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> as are, for
instance, the Ionian Islands of Corfu and Paxo, which
are now a part of the territory of the Kingdom of
Greece. Such State has the duty to remain always
partially neutral&mdash;namely, as far as its neutralised
part is concerned. In contradistinction to such partial
neutrality, general neutrality is the neutrality of States
no part of whose territory is neutralised by treaty.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_564_564" id="Footnote_564_564"></a><a href="#FNanchor_564_564"><span class="label">[564]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#Although_the_Open_Sea72">72</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Voluntary and Conventional Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 302. A third distinction is that between voluntary
and conventional neutrality. Voluntary (or simple or
natural) is the neutrality of such State as is not bound
by a general or special treaty to remain neutral in a
certain war. Neutrality is in most cases voluntary,
and States whose neutrality is voluntary may at any
time during the war give up their attitude of impartiality
and take the part of either belligerent. On
the other hand, the neutrality of such State as is by
treaty bound to remain neutral in a war is conventional.
Of course, the neutrality of neutralised States is in
every case conventional. Yet not-neutralised States
can likewise by treaty be obliged to remain neutral in
a certain war, just as in other cases they can by treaty
of alliance be compelled not to remain neutral, but to
take the part of one of the belligerents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Armed
Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 303. One speaks of an armed neutrality when a
neutral State takes military measures for the purpose
of defending its neutrality against possible or probable
attempts of either belligerent to make use of the neutral
territory. Thus, the neutrality of Switzerland during
the Franco-German War was an armed neutrality. In
another sense of the term, one speaks of an armed
neutrality when neutral States take military measures
for the purpose of defending the real or pretended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
rights of neutrals against threatening infringements on
the part of either belligerent. The First and Second
Armed Neutrality<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> of 1780 and 1800 were armed
neutralities in the latter sense of the term.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_565_565" id="Footnote_565_565"></a><a href="#FNanchor_565_565"><span class="label">[565]</span></a> Se

<div class="sidenote"><p>Benevolent
Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 304. Treaties stipulating neutrality often stipulate
a "benevolent" neutrality of the parties regarding
a certain war. The term is likewise frequently used
during diplomatic negotiations. However, at present
there is no distinction between benevolent neutrality
and neutrality pure and simple. The idea dates from
earlier times, when the obligations imposed by neutrality
were not so stringent, and neutral States could
favour one of the belligerents in many ways without
thereby violating their neutral attitude. If a State
remained neutral in the then lax sense of the term,
but otherwise favoured a belligerent, its neutrality was
called benevolent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Perfect
and Qualified
Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 305. <a name="A_distinction_of305" id="A_distinction_of305"></a>A distinction of great practical importance
was in former times that between perfect, or absolute,
and qualified, or imperfect, neutrality. The neutrality
of a State was qualified if it remained neutral on the
whole, but actively or passively, directly or indirectly,
gave some kind of assistance to one of the belligerents in
consequence of an obligation entered into by a treaty
previous to the war, and not for the special war exclusively.
On the other hand, a neutrality was termed
perfect if a neutral State neither actively nor passively,
and neither directly nor indirectly, favoured either
belligerent. There is no doubt that in the eighteenth
century, when it was recognised that a State could be
considered neutral, although it was by a previous
treaty bound to render more or less limited assistance
to one of the belligerents, this distinction between
neutrality perfect and qualified was justified. But
during the second half of the nineteenth century it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
became controversial whether a so-called qualified
neutrality was neutrality at all, and whether a State,
which, in fulfilment of a treaty obligation, rendered
some assistance to one of the belligerents, violated its
neutrality. The majority of modern writers<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> maintained,
correctly I think, that a State was either neutral
or not, and that a State violated its neutrality in case
it rendered any assistance whatever to one of the
belligerents from any motive whatever. For this
reason, a State which had entered into such obligations
as those just mentioned would in time of war frequently
be in a conflict of duties. For, in fulfilling its treaty
obligations, it would frequently be obliged to violate its
duty of neutrality, and <i>vice versa</i>. Several writers,<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
however, maintained that such fulfilment of treaty
obligations would not contain a violation of neutrality.
All doubt in the matter ought now to be removed, since
article 2 of Convention V. of the Second Peace Conference
categorically enacts that "belligerents are forbidden
to move across the territory of a neutral Power troops
or convoys either of munitions of war or of supplies."
The principle at the back of this enactment no doubt is
that a qualified neutrality has no longer any <i>raison d'être</i>,
and that neutrality must in every case be perfect.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

passage of troops). Phillimore, III. § 138, goes with the majority of
publicists, but in § 139 he thinks that it would be too rigid to
consider acts of "minor" partiality which are the result of conventions
previous to the war as violations of neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 306. <a name="For_the_purpose_of306" id="For_the_purpose_of306"></a>For the purpose of illustration the following
instances of qualified neutrality may be mentioned:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) By a treaty of amity and commerce concluded
in 1778 between the United States of America and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
France, the former granted for the time of war to
French privateers and their prizes the right of admission
to American ports, and entered into the obligation
not to admit the privateers of the enemies of
France. When subsequently, in 1793, war was waged
between England and France, and England complained
of the admission of French privateers to American ports,
the United States met the complaint by advancing their
treaty obligations.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>(2) Denmark had by several treaties, especially by
one of 1781, undertaken the obligation to furnish
Russia with a certain number of men-of-war and
troops. When, in 1788, during war between Russia
and Sweden, Denmark fulfilled her obligations towards
Russia, she nevertheless declared herself neutral. And
although Sweden protested against the possibility of such
qualified neutrality, she acquiesced in the fact and did
not consider herself to be at war with Denmark.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>(3) In 1848, during war between Germany and
Denmark, Great Britain, fulfilling a treaty obligation

to Germany, whereas such exportation to Denmark
remained undisturbed.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality commences with Knowledge of the War.</p></div>

<p>§ 307. <a name="Since_neutrality307" id="Since_neutrality307"></a>Since neutrality is an attitude of impartiality
deliberately taken up by a State not implicated in a
war, neutrality cannot begin before the outbreak of
war becomes known. It is only then that third States
can make up their minds whether or not they intend to
remain neutral. They are supposed to remain neutral,
and the duties deriving from neutrality are incumbent
upon them so long as they do not <i>expressis verbis</i> or by
unmistakable acts declare that they will be parties to
the war. It had long been the usual practice on the
part of belligerents to notify the outbreak of war to
third States for the purpose of enabling them to take
up the necessary attitude of impartiality, but such
notification was not formerly in strict law necessary.
The mere fact of the knowledge of the outbreak of war
which had been obtained in any way gave a third State
an opportunity of making up its mind regarding the
attitude which it intended to take up, and, if it remained
neutral, its neutrality was to be dated from the time
of its knowledge of the outbreak of war. But it is
apparent that an immediate notification of the war on the
part of belligerents is of great importance, as thereby
all doubt and controversy regarding the knowledge of
the outbreak of war are excluded. For the fact must
always be remembered that a neutral State may in no
way be made responsible for acts of its own or of its
subjects which have been performed before it knew
of the war, although the outbreak of war might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
expected. For this reason article 2 of Convention III.
of the Second Peace Conference enacts that belligerents
must without delay send a notification of the outbreak
of war, which may even be made by telegraph, to
neutral Powers, and that the condition of war shall not
take effect in regard to neutral Powers until after receipt
of a notification, unless it be established beyond doubt
that they were in fact aware of the outbreak of war.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Commencement of Neutrality in Civil War.</p></div>

<p>§ 308. As civil war becomes real war through recognition
of the insurgents as a belligerent Power,
neutrality during a civil war begins for every foreign
State from the moment recognition is granted. That
recognition might be granted or refused by foreign
States independently of the attitude of the legitimate
Government has been stated above in § <a href="#Since_neutrality298">298</a>, where
also an explanation is given of the consequences of
recognition granted either by foreign States alone or
by the legitimate Government alone.</p>

<p>§ 309. <a name="Neutrality_being309" id="Neutrality_being309"></a>Neutrality being an attitude of States
creating rights and duties, active measures on the part
of a neutral state are required for the purpose of preventing
its officials and subjects from committing
acts incompatible with its duty of impartiality. Now,
the manifesto by which a neutral State orders its
organs and subjects to comply with the attitude of
impartiality adopted by itself is called a declaration of
neutrality in the special sense of the term. Such declaration
of neutrality must not, however, be confounded,
on the one hand, with manifestoes of the
belligerents proclaiming to neutrals the rights and
duties devolving upon them through neutrality, or, on
the other hand, with the assertions made by neutrals
to belligerents or <i>urbi et orbi</i> that they will remain
neutral, although these manifestoes and assertions are
often also called declarations of neutrality.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Municipal
Neutrality
Laws.</p></div>

<p>§ 310. International Law leaves the provision of
necessary measures for the establishment of neutrality
to the discretion of each State. Since in constitutional
States the powers of Governments are frequently so
limited by Municipal Law that they may not take
adequate measures without the consent of their Parliaments,
and since it is, so far as International Law is
concerned, no excuse for a Government if it is by its
Municipal Law prevented from taking adequate measures,
several States have once for all enacted so-called
Neutrality Laws, which prescribe the attitude to be taken
up by their officials and subjects in case the States
concerned remain neutral in a war. These Neutrality
Laws are latent in time of peace, but their provisions
become operative <i>ipso facto</i> by the respective States
making a declaration of neutrality to their officials and
subjects.</p>

<p>§ 311. After the United States of America had on
April 20, 1818, enacted<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> a Neutrality Law, Great

Act, "equipping" includes "the furnishing of a ship with any tackle,
apparel, furniture, provisions, arms, munitions, or stores, or any other
thing which is used in or about a ship for the purpose of fitting or
adapting her for the sea or for naval service." It is, therefore, not
lawful for British ships, in case Great Britain is neutral, to supply a
belligerent fleet direct with coal, a point which became of interest
during the Russo-Japanese War. German steamers laden with coal followed
the Russian fleet on her journey to the Far East, and British shipowners
were prevented from doing the same by the Foreign Enlistment Act. And it
was in application of this Act that the British Government ordered, in
1904, the detention of the German steamer <i>Captain W. Menzel</i>, which
took in Welsh coal at Cardiff for the purpose of carrying it to the
Russian fleet <i>en route</i> to the Far East. See below, § <a href="#In_contradistinction350">350</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_580_580" id="Footnote_580_580"></a><a href="#FNanchor_580_580"><span class="label">[580]</span></a> An interesting case which ought here to be mentioned
occurred in October 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War. Messrs. Yarrow
&amp; Co., the shipbuilders, possessed a partly completed vessel, the
<i>Caroline</i>, which could be finally fitted up either as a yacht or as a
torpedo-boat. In September 1904, a Mr. Sinnet and the Hon. James Burke
Roche called at the shipbuilding yard of Messrs. Yarrow, bought the
<i>Caroline</i>, and ordered her to be fitted up as a high-speed yacht. The
required additions were finished on October 3. On October 6 the vessel
left Messrs. Yarrow's yard and was navigated by a Captain Ryder, <i>via</i>
Hamburg, to the Russian port of Libau, there to be altered into a
torpedo-boat. That section 8 of the Foreign Enlistment Act applies to
this case there is no doubt. But there is no doubt either that it is
this Act, and not the rules of International Law, which required the
prosecution of Messrs. Sinnet and Roche on the part of the British
Government. For, if viewed from the basis of International Law, the case
is merely one of contraband. See below, §§ <a href="#If_a_State_remains321">321</a>, <a href="#Whereas_a_neutral334">334</a>, and <a href="#A_neutral_vessel397">397</a>.</p></div>

<p>It must be specially observed that the British
Foreign Enlistment Act goes beyond the requirements
of International Law in so far as it tries to prohibit
and penalises a number of acts which, according to the
present rules of International Law, a neutral State is not
required to prohibit and penalise. Thus, for instance,
a neutral State need not prohibit its private subjects
from enlisting in the service of a belligerent; from
supplying coal, provisions, arms, and ammunition direct
to a belligerent fleet, provided such fleet is not within
or just outside the territorial waters of the neutral
concerned; from selling ships to a belligerent although
it is known that they will be converted into cruisers or
used as transport ships. For article 7 of Convention
VII. as well as of Convention XIII. of the Second Peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
Conference categorically enacts that "a neutral Power
is not bound to prevent the export or transit, on behalf
of either belligerent, of arms, munitions of war, or, in
general, of anything which could be of use to an army
or fleet."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>End of
Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 312. <a name="Neutrality_ends_with312" id="Neutrality_ends_with312"></a>Neutrality ends with the war, or through
the commencement of war by a hitherto neutral State
against one of the belligerents, or through one of the
belligerents commencing war against a hitherto neutral
State. Since, apart from a treaty obligation, no State
has by International Law the duty to remain neutral in
a war between other States,<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> or, if it is a belligerent, to
allow a hitherto neutral State to remain neutral,<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> it does
not constitute a violation of neutrality on the part of a
hitherto neutral to declare war against one of the
belligerents, and on the part of a belligerent to declare
war against a neutral. Duties of neutrality exist so
long only as a State remains neutral. They come to an
end <i>ipso facto</i> by a hitherto neutral State throwing up
its neutrality, or by a belligerent beginning war against a
hitherto neutral State. But the ending of neutrality
must not be confounded with violation of neutrality.
Such violation does not <i>ipso facto</i> bring neutrality to an
end, as will be shown below in § <a href="#Violation_of_neutrality358">358</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conduct in General of Neutrals and Belligerents.</p></div>

<p>§ 313. Neutrality can be carried out only if neutrals
as well as belligerents follow a certain line of conduct
in their relations with one another. It is for this
reason that from neutrality derive rights and duties,
as well for belligerents as for neutrals, and that, consequently,
neutrality can be violated as well by belligerents
as by neutrals. These rights and duties are
correspondent: the duties of neutrals correspond to
the rights of either belligerent, and the duties of either
belligerent correspond to the rights of the neutrals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What Rights and Duties of Neutrals and of Belligerents there
are.</p></div>

<p>§ 314. <a name="There_are_two_rights314" id="There_are_two_rights314"></a>There are two rights and two duties deriving
from neutrality for neutrals, and likewise two for
belligerents.</p>

<p>Duties of neutrals are, firstly, to act toward
belligerents in accordance with their attitude of
impartiality; and, secondly, to acquiesce in the exercise
of either belligerent's right to punish neutral
merchantmen for breach of blockade, carriage of contraband,
and rendering unneutral service to the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
and, accordingly, to visit, search, and eventually
capture them.</p>

<p>The duties of either belligerent are, firstly, to act
towards neutrals in accordance with their attitude of
impartiality; and, secondly, not to suppress their
intercourse, and in especial their commerce, with the
enemy.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_583_583" id="Footnote_583_583"></a><a href="#FNanchor_583_583"><span class="label">[583]</span></a> All writers on International Law resolve the duty of
impartiality incumbent upon neutrals into many several duties, and they
do the same as regards the duty of belligerents&mdash;namely, to act toward
neutrals in accordance with the latter's impartiality. In this way quite
a large catalogue of duties and corresponding rights are produced, and
the whole matter is unnecessarily complicated.</p></div>

<p>Either belligerent has a right to demand impartiality
from neutrals, whereas, on the other hand, neutrals
have a right to demand such behaviour from either
belligerent as is in accordance with their attitude of
impartiality. Neutrals have a right to demand that
their intercourse, and in especial their commerce, with
the enemy shall not be suppressed; whereas, on the
other hand, either belligerent has the right to punish
subjects of neutrals for breach of blockade, carriage
of contraband, and unneutral service, and, accordingly,
to visit, search, and capture neutral merchantmen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Rights and Duties of Neutrals contested.</p></div>

<p>§ 315. Some writers<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> maintain that no rights
derive from neutrality for neutrals, and, consequently,
no duties for belligerents, because everything which
must be left undone by a belligerent regarding his
relations with a neutral must likewise be left undone
in time of peace. But this opinion has no foundation.
Indeed, it is true that the majority of the acts which
belligerents must leave undone in consequence of their
duty to respect neutrality must likewise be left undone
in time of peace in consequence of the territorial
supremacy of every State. However, there are several
acts which do not belong to this class&mdash;for instance,
the non-appropriation of enemy goods on neutral vessels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
And those acts which do belong to this class fall nevertheless
at the same time under another category.
Thus, a violation of neutral territory on the part of a
belligerent for military and naval purposes of the war
is indeed an act prohibited in time of peace, because
every State has to respect the territorial supremacy of
other States; but it is at the same time a violation of
neutrality, and therefore totally different from other
violations of foreign territorial supremacy. This becomes
quite apparent when the true inwardness of such
acts is regarded. For every State has a right to demand
reparation for an ordinary violation of its territorial
supremacy, but it need not take any notice of it,
and it has no duty to demand reparation. Yet in case
a violation of its territorial supremacy constitutes at
the same time a violation of its neutrality, the neutral
State has not only a right to demand reparation, but
has a duty<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> to do so. For, if it did not, this would
contain a violation of its duty of impartiality, because
it would be favouring one belligerent to the detriment
of the other.<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

Second Peace Conference, which enacts:&mdash;"When a ship has been captured
in the territorial waters of a neutral Power, such Power must, if the
prize is still within its jurisdiction, employ the means at its disposal
to release the prize with its officers and crew, and to intern the prize
crew. If the prize is not within the jurisdiction of the neutral Power,
the captor Government, on the demand of that Power, must liberate the
prize with its officers and crew."</p></div>

 below, § <a href="#It_is_entirely360">360</a>.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, it has been asserted<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> that,
apart from conventional neutrality, from which treaty
obligations arise, it is incorrect to speak of duties deriving
from neutrality, since at any moment during
the war neutrals could throw up neutrality and become
parties to the war. I cannot agree with this opinion
either. That a hitherto neutral can at any moment
throw up neutrality and take part in the war, is just as
true as that a belligerent can at any moment during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
the war declare war against a hitherto neutral State.
Yet this only proves that there is no duty to remain
neutral, and no duty for a belligerent to abstain from
declaring war against a hitherto neutral State. This is
a truism which ought not to be doubted, and is totally
different from the question as to what duties derive
from neutrality so long as a certain State remains
neutral at all. The assertion that such duties derive
from neutrality is in no way inconsistent with the fact
that neutrality itself can at any moment during the war
come to an end through the beginning of war by either
a neutral or a belligerent. This assertion only states
the fact that, so long as neutrals intend neutrality and
so long as belligerents intend to recognise such neutrality
of third States, duties derive from neutrality for both
belligerents and neutrals.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_587_587" id="Footnote_587_587"></a><a href="#FNanchor_587_587"><span class="label">[587]</span></a> See Gareis, § 88.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Contents
of Duty
of Impartiality.</p></div>

<p>§ 316. It has already been stated above, in § 294, that
impartiality <i>excludes</i> such assistance and succour to
one of the belligerents as is detrimental to the other,
and, further, such injuries to one of the belligerents as
benefit the other, and that it <i>includes</i> active measures
on the part of neutrals for the purpose of preventing
belligerents from making use of neutral territories and
neutral resources for their military and naval purposes.
But all this does not exhaust the contents of the duty
of impartiality.</p>

<p>It must, on the one hand, be added that according
to the present strict conception of neutrality the duty
of impartiality of a neutral <i>excludes</i> all facilities whatever
for military and naval operations of the belligerents,
even if granted to both belligerents alike. In former
times assistance was not considered a violation of
neutrality, provided it was given to both belligerents
in the same way, and States were considered neutral
although they allowed an equal number of their troops
to fight on the side of each belligerent. To-day this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
could no longer happen. From Conventions V. and
XIII. of the Second Peace Conference, which deal with
neutrality in land and sea warfare respectively, it
becomes quite apparent that any facility whatever
directly concerning military or naval operations, even
if it consists only in granting passage over neutral
territory to belligerent forces, is illegal, although granted
to both belligerents alike. <i>The duty of impartiality
to-day comprises abstention from any active or passive
co-operation with belligerents.</i></p>

<p>On the other hand, it must be added that the duty
of impartiality <i>includes</i> the equal treatment of both
belligerents regarding such facilities as do not directly
concern military or naval operations, and which may,
therefore, be granted or not to belligerents, according
to the discretion of a neutral. If a neutral grants such
facilities to one belligerent, he must grant them to the
other in the same degree. If he refuses them to the
one, he must likewise refuse them to the other.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Thus,
since it does not, according to the International Law
of the present day, constitute a violation of neutrality
if a neutral allows his subjects to supply either belligerent
with arms and ammunition in the ordinary way
of trade, it would constitute a violation of neutrality
to prohibit the export of arms destined for one of the
belligerents only. Thus, further, if a neutral allows
men-of-war of one of the belligerents to bring their
prizes into neutral ports, he must grant the same facility
to the other belligerent.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_588_588" id="Footnote_588_588"></a><a href="#FNanchor_588_588"><span class="label">[588]</span></a> See articles 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, of Convention V., and

Peace Conference.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Duty of Impartiality continuously growing more intense.</p></div>

<p>§ 317. Although neutrality has already for centuries
been recognised as an attitude of impartiality, it has
taken two hundred years for the duty of impartiality
to attain its present range and intensity. Now this
continuous development has by no means ceased. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
is slowly and gradually going on, and there is no doubt
that during the twentieth century the duty of impartiality
will become much more intense than it is at
present. The fact that the intensity of this duty is
the result of gradual development bears upon many
practical questions regarding the conduct of neutrals.
It is therefore necessary to discuss separately the
relations between neutrals and belligerents in order to
ascertain what line of conduct must be followed by
neutrals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutrality Conventions of the Second Peace Conference.</p></div>

<p>Both Conventions deal comprehensively with the
rights and duties of neutrals, but it is not convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
in a treatise on International Law either to treat
separately of the duties of neutrals in war on land and
on sea, or to dispense with any distinction in the treatment
of the several points concerned. The arrangement
of topics in the sections of this chapter will, therefore,
be independent of the arrangement of topics in the two
Conventions, and will be as follows:&mdash;Neutrals and
Military Operations (§§ <a href="#The_duty_of_impartiality320">320</a>-328); Neutrals and Military
Preparations (§§ <a href="#Although_according329">329</a>-335); Neutral Asylum to Soldiers

<p>§ 318. Whereas the relations between neutrals
and belligerents require detailed discussion with regard
to the duty of impartiality incumbent upon neutrals,
the contents of the duty of belligerents to treat neutrals
in accordance with their impartiality are so manifest
that elaborate treatment is unnecessary. Such duty
<i>excludes</i>, firstly, any violation of neutral territory for
military or naval purposes of the war;<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> and, secondly,
the appropriation of neutral goods, contraband excepted,
on enemy vessels.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> On the other hand, such
duty <i>includes</i>, firstly, due treatment of neutral diplomatic
envoys accredited to the enemy and found on
occupied enemy territory; and, secondly, due treatment
of neutral subjects and neutral property on
enemy territory. A belligerent who conquers enemy
territory must at least grant to neutral envoys accredited
to the enemy the right to quit the occupied
territory unmolested.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> And such belligerent must likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
abstain from treating neutral subjects and property
established on enemy territory more harshly than the
laws of war allow; for, although neutral subjects and
property have, by being established on enemy territory,
acquired enemy character, they have nevertheless not
lost the protection of their neutral home State.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> And
such belligerent must, lastly, pay full damages in case
he makes use of his right of angary<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> against neutral

and the Enemy.</p></div>

<p>§ 319. <a name="The_duty_of_either319" id="The_duty_of_either319"></a>The duty of either belligerent not to suppress
intercourse of neutrals with the enemy requires no
detailed discussion either. It is a duty which is in
accordance with the development of the institution of
neutrality. It is of special importance with regard to
commerce of subjects of neutrals with belligerents, since
formerly attempts were frequently made to intercept
all neutral trade with the enemy. A consequence of
the now recognised freedom of neutral commerce with
either belligerent is, firstly, the rule, enacted by the
Declaration of Paris of 1856, that enemy goods, with the
exception of contraband, on neutral vessels on the
Open Sea or in enemy territorial waters may not be
appropriated by a belligerent,<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> and, secondly, the rule,
enacted by article 1 of Convention XI. of the Second
Peace Conference, that the postal correspondence of
neutrals or belligerents, except correspondence destined
for or proceeding from a blockaded port, which may
be found on a neutral or enemy vessel, is inviolable.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
But the recognised freedom of neutral commerce
necessitates, on the other hand, certain measures on
the part of belligerents. It would be unreasonable to
impose on a belligerent a duty not to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
subjects of neutrals from breaking a blockade, from
carrying contraband, and, lastly, from rendering unneutral
service to the enemy. International Law gives,
therefore, a right to either belligerent to forbid all such
acts to neutral merchantmen, and, accordingly, to
visit, search, capture, and punish them.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Hostilities
by and
against
Neutrals.</p></div>

<p>§ 320. <a name="The_duty_of_impartiality320" id="The_duty_of_impartiality320"></a>The duty of impartiality incumbent upon a
neutral must obviously prevent him from committing
hostilities against either belligerent. This would need
no mention were it not for the purpose of distinction
between hostilities on the one hand, and, on the other,
military or naval acts of force by a neutral for the
purpose of repulsing violations of his neutrality committed
by either belligerent. Hostilities of a neutral
are acts of force performed for the purpose of attacking
a belligerent. They are acts of war, and they create
a condition of war between such neutral and the belligerent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
concerned. If, however, a neutral does not
attack a belligerent, but only repulses him by force
when he violates or attempts to violate the neutrality of
the neutral, such repulse does not comprise hostilities.
Thus, if men-of-war of a belligerent attack an enemy
vessel in a neutral port and are repulsed by neutral
men-of-war, or if belligerent forces try to make their
way through neutral territory and are forcibly prevented
by neutral troops, no hostilities have been
committed by the neutral, who has done nothing else
than fulfil his duty of impartiality. Article 10 of
Convention V. enacts categorically that "the fact of
a neutral Power repelling, even by force, attacks on
its neutrality, cannot be considered as a hostile act."
And stress must be laid on the fact that it is no longer
legitimate for a belligerent to pursue<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> military or naval
forces who take refuge on neutral territory; should,
nevertheless, a belligerent do this, he must, if possible,
be repulsed by the neutral.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_600_600" id="Footnote_600_600"></a><a href="#FNanchor_600_600"><span class="label">[600]</span></a> See
 above, § <a href="#It_was_not_until288">288</a>, p. 352, and below, § <a href="#Asylum_can4of347">347 (4)</a>, p. 422.</p></div>

<p>It is, on the other hand, likewise obvious that
hostilities against a neutral on the part of either belligerent
are acts of war, and not mere violations of
neutrality. If, however, belligerent forces attack
enemy forces which have taken refuge on neutral
territory or which are there for other purposes, such
acts are not hostilities against the neutral, but mere
violations of neutrality which must be repulsed or for
which reparation must be made, as the case may be.</p>

<p>Quite a peculiar condition arose at the outbreak of
and during the Russo-Japanese War. The ends for
which Japan went to war were the expulsion of the
Russian forces from the Chinese Province of Manchuria
and the liberation of Korea, which was at the
time an independent State, from the influence of
Russia. Manchuria and Korea became therefore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
theatre of war, although both were neutral territories
and although neither China nor Korea became parties
to the war. The hostilities which occurred on these
neutral territories were in no wise directed against the
neutrals concerned. This anomalous condition of
matters arose out of the inability of both China and
Korea to free themselves from Russian occupation and
influence. And Japan considered her action, which
must be classified as an intervention, justified on
account of her vital interests. The Powers recognised
this anomalous condition by influencing China not to
take part in the war, and by influencing the belligerents
not to extend military operations beyond the borders
of Manchuria. Manchuria and Korea having become
the theatre of war,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> the hostilities committed there by
the belligerents against one another cannot be classified
as a violation of neutrality. The case of the <i>Variag</i>
and the <i>Korietz</i> on the one hand, and, on the other, the
case of the <i>Reshitelni</i>, may illustrate the peculiar condition
of affairs:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) On February 8, 1904, a Japanese squadron
under Admiral Uriu entered the Korean harbour of
Chemulpo and disembarked Japanese troops. The
next morning Admiral Uriu requested the commanders
of two Russian ships in the harbour of Chemulpo, the
<i>Variag</i> and the <i>Korietz</i>, to leave the harbour and engage
him in battle outside, threatening attack inside the
harbour in case they would not comply with his request.
But the Russian ships did comply, and the battle took
place outside the harbour, but within Korean territorial
waters.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> The complaint made by Russia, that in this
case the Japanese violated Korean neutrality, would
seem to be unjustified, since Korea fell within the
region and the theatre of war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) The Russian destroyer <i>Reshitelni</i>, one of the
vessels that escaped from Port Arthur on August 10,
1904, took refuge in the Chinese harbour of Chifu.
On August 12, two Japanese destroyers entered the
harbour, captured the <i>Reshitelni</i>, and towed her away.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
There ought to be no doubt that this act of the Japanese
comprises a violation of neutrality,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> since Chifu does
not belong to the part of China which fell within the
region of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Furnishing Troops and Men-of-War to Belligerents.</p></div>

<p>§ 321. <a name="If_a_State_remains321" id="If_a_State_remains321"></a>If a State remains neutral, it violates its
impartiality by furnishing a belligerent with troops
or men-of-war. And it matters not whether a neutral
renders such assistance to one of the belligerents or to
both alike. Whereas Convention V. does not mention
the furnishing of troops to belligerents on the part of
neutrals, article 6 of Convention XIII. enacts that
"the supply, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by
a neutral Power to a belligerent Power, of warships,
ammunition, or war material of any kind whatever, is
forbidden."</p>

<p>However, the question is controversial as to whether a
neutral State, which in time of peace concluded a treaty
with one of the belligerents to furnish him in case of
war with a limited number of troops, would violate its
neutrality by fulfilling its treaty obligation. Several
writers<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> have answered the question in the negative,
and there is no doubt that during the eighteenth century
such cases happened. But no case happened during
the nineteenth century, and there ought to be no doubt
that nowadays the answer must be in the affirmative,
since a qualified neutrality<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> is no longer admissible.</p>

<p>As regards furnishing men-of-war to belligerents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
the question arose during the Russo-Japanese War as
to whether a neutral violates his duty of impartiality
by not preventing his national steamship companies
from selling to a belligerent such of their liners as are
destined in case of war to be incorporated as cruisers
in the national navy. The question was discussed on
account of the sale to Russia of the <i>Augusta Victoria</i>
and the <i>Kaiserin Maria Theresia</i> by the North German
Lloyd, and the <i>Fürst Bismarck</i> and the <i>Columbia</i> by the
Hamburg-American Line, vessels which were at once
enrolled in the Russian Navy as second-class cruisers,
re-named as the <i>Kuban</i>, <i>Ural</i>, <i>Don</i>, and <i>Terek</i>. Had
these vessels, according to an arrangement with the
German Government, really been auxiliary cruisers to
the German Navy, and had the German Government
given its consent to the transaction, a violation of
neutrality would have been committed by Germany.
But the German Press maintained that these vessels
had not been auxiliary cruisers to the Navy, and
Japan did not lodge a protest with Germany on account
of the sale. If these liners were not auxiliary cruisers
to the German Navy, their sale to Russia was a legitimate
sale of articles of contraband.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

and the United States of America, by their Municipal
Law prohibit their subjects from enlisting in the military
or naval service of belligerents, the duty of impartiality
incumbent upon neutrals does not at present include
any necessity for such prohibition, provided the individuals
concerned cross the frontier singly<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> and not
in a body. But a neutral must recall his military and
naval officers who may have been serving in the army
or navy of either belligerent before the outbreak of
war. A neutral must, further, retain military and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
naval officers who want to resign their commissions for
the obvious purpose of enlisting in the service of either

Russian and entered the Servian Army as volunteers
with permission of the Russian Government, there was
a violation of the duty of impartiality on the part of
neutral Russia.</p>

<p>§ 323. <a name="In_contradistinction323" id="In_contradistinction323"></a>In contradistinction to the practice of the
eighteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> it is now generally recognised that
a violation of the duty of impartiality is involved when
a neutral allows a belligerent the passage of troops or the
transport of war material over his territory.<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> And it
matters not whether a neutral gives such permission to
one of the belligerents only, or to both alike. The
practice of the eighteenth century was a necessity, since
many German States consisted of parts distant one from
another, so that their troops had to pass through other
Sovereigns' territories for the purpose of reaching
outlying parts. At the beginning of the nineteenth
century the passing of belligerent troops through
neutral territory still occurred. Prussia, although she
at first repeatedly refused it, at last entered in 1805
into a secret convention with Russia granting Russian
troops passage through Silesia during war with France.
On the other hand, even before Russia had made use
of this permission, Napoleon ordered Bernadotte to
march French troops through the then Prussian territory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
of Anspach without even asking the consent of Prussia.
In spite of the protest of the Swiss Government, Austrian
troops passed through Swiss territory in 1813, and
when in 1815 war broke out again through the escape
of Napoleon from the Island of Elba and his return to
France, Switzerland granted to the allied troops passage
through her territory.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> But since that time it has
become universally recognised that all passage of belligerent
troops through neutral territory must be prohibited,
and the Powers declared <i>expressis verbis</i> in the
Act of November 20, 1815, which neutralised Switzerland,
and was signed at Paris,<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> that "no inference
unfavourable to the neutrality and inviolability of
Switzerland can and must be drawn from the facts
which have caused the passage of the allied troops
through a part of the territory of the Swiss Confederation."
The few instances<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> in which during the
nineteenth century States pretended to remain neutral,
but nevertheless allowed the troops of one of the belligerents
passage through their territory, led to war
between the neutral and the other belligerent.</p>

<p>However, just as in the case of furnishing troops
so in the case of passage, it is a moot point whether
passage of troops can be granted without thereby
violating the duty of impartiality incumbent upon a
neutral, in case a neutral is required to grant it in consequence
of an existing State-servitude or of a treaty
previous to the war. There ought to be no doubt that,
since nowadays a qualified neutrality is no longer admissible,
the question must be answered in the negative.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>§ 324. The passage of wounded soldiers is different
from that of troops. If a neutral allows the passage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
wounded soldiers, he certainly does not render direct
assistance to the belligerent concerned. But it may well
be that indirectly it is of assistance on account of the
fact that a belligerent, thereby relieved from transport
of his wounded, can now use the lines of communication
for the transport of troops, war material, and provisions.
Thus, when in 1870 after the battles of Sedan and Metz,
Germany applied to Belgium and Luxemburg to allow her
wounded to be sent through their territories, France
protested on the ground that the relief thereby created
to the lines of communication in the hands of the
Germans would be an assistance to the military operations
of the German Army. Belgium, on the advice
of Great Britain, did not grant the request made by
Germany, but Luxemburg granted it.<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>

<p>According to article 14 of Convention V. a neutral
Power <i>may</i> grant the passage of wounded or sick to a
belligerent. If he does grant it, the trains bringing
them must carry neither combatants nor war material,
and those of the wounded and sick who belong to the
army of the other belligerent must remain on the
neutral territory concerned, must there be guarded
by the neutral Government, and must, after having
recovered, be prevented from returning to their home
State and rejoining their corps. By the stipulation of
article 14 it is left to the consideration of a neutral
whether or no he will allow the passage of wounded and
sick to a belligerent; he will, therefore, have to investigate
every case and come to a conclusion according
to its merits. It should be stated that, according to
article 15 of Convention V., the "Geneva Convention
applies to the sick and wounded interned in neutral
territory."</p>

<p>§ 325. In contradistinction to passage of troops
through his territory, the duty of impartiality incumbent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
upon a neutral does not require him to forbid
the passage of belligerent men-of-war through the
maritime belt forming part of his territorial waters.
Article 10 of Convention XIII. categorically enacts that
"the neutrality of a Power is not violated (<i>n'est pas
compromise</i>) by the mere passage of belligerent men-of-war
and their prizes." Since, as stated above in
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#Although_the_maritime188">Vol. I. § 188</a>, every littoral State may even in time of
peace prohibit the passage of foreign men-of-war
through its maritime belt provided such belt does not
form a part of the highways for international traffic, it
may certainly prohibit the passage of belligerent men-of-war
in time of war. However, no duty exists for a
neutral to prohibit such passage in time of war, and
he need not exclude belligerent men-of-war from his
ports either, although he may do this likewise. The
reason is that such passage and such admittance into
ports contain very little assistance indeed, and are
justified by the character of the sea as an international
high road. But it is, on the other hand, obvious that
belligerent men-of-war must not commit any hostilities
against enemy vessels during their passage, and must
not use the neutral maritime belt and neutral ports as a
basis for their operations against the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Prize Courts on Neutral Territory.</p></div>

<p>§ 327. <a name="It_has_long_been_universally_recognised327" id="It_has_long_been_universally_recognised327"></a>It has long been universally recognised that the
duty of impartiality must prevent a neutral from permitting
a belligerent to set up Prize Courts on neutral
territory. The intention of a belligerent in setting
up a court on neutral territory can only be to facilitate
the plundering by his men-of-war of the commerce of
the enemy. A neutral tolerating such Prize Courts
would, therefore, indirectly assist the belligerent in his
naval operations. During the eighteenth century it
was not considered illegitimate on the part of neutrals to
allow the setting up of Prize Courts on their territory.
The <i>Règlement du Roi de France concernant les prises
qui seront conduites dans les ports étrangers, et des
formalités que doivent remplir les Consuls de S.M. qui y
sont établis</i> of 1779, furnishes a striking proof of it.
But since in 1793 the United States of America disorganised
the French Prize Courts set up by the French
envoy Genêt on her territory,<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> it became recognised
that such Prize Courts are inconsistent with the duty
of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral, and article 4
of Convention XIII. enacts this formerly customary
rule.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_621_621" id="Footnote_621_621"></a><a href="#FNanchor_621_621"><span class="label">[621]</span></a> See

<p>§ 328. <a name="It_would_no_doubt328" id="It_would_no_doubt328"></a>It would, no doubt, be an indirect assistance
to the naval operations of a belligerent if a neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
allowed him to organise on neutral territory the safekeeping
of prizes or their sale.</p>

<p>But the case of a temporary stay of a belligerent
man-of-war with her prize in a neutral port is different.
Neutral Powers may&mdash;although most maritime States
no longer do it&mdash;allow prizes to be brought temporarily
into their ports. Articles 21 and 22 of Convention XIII.
lay down the following rules in the matter: A prize
may only be brought into a neutral port on account of
unseaworthiness, stress of weather, or want of fuel or
provisions; it must leave as soon as the circumstances
which justified its entry are at an end, and if it does
not, the neutral Power must order it to leave at once and
must, in case of disobedience, employ the means at
disposal to release the prize with its officers and crew,
and to intern the prize-crew; a prize brought into a
neutral port for reasons other than unseaworthiness,
stress of weather, or want of fuel or provisions, must
forthwith be released by the respective neutral Power.</p>

<p>The question requires attention as to whether a
prize whose unseaworthiness is so great that it cannot
be repaired, may be allowed to remain in the neutral
port and be there sold<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> after the competent Prize
Court has condemned it. Since article 21 enacts that
an admitted prize must leave the neutral port as soon
as the circumstances which justified its entry are at an
end, there is no doubt that it may remain if it cannot
by repair be made seaworthy. And there ought,
consequently, to be no objection to its sale in the neutral
port, provided it has previously been condemned by the
proper Prize Court.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_622_622" id="Footnote_622_622"></a><a href="#FNanchor_622_622"><span class="label">[622]</span></a> See Kleen, vol. I. § 115.</p></div>

<p>While the stipulation of article 21 cannot meet with
any objection, the stipulation of article 23 of Convention
XIII. is of a very doubtful character. This article
enacts that a neutral Power may allow prizes to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
its ports, whether under convoy or not, when they are
brought there to be sequestrated pending the decision of
a Prize Court. And it is of importance to state the fact
that the restriction of article 21 does not apply to
prizes brought into a neutral port under the rule of
article 23. This rule actually enables a belligerent to
safeguard all his prizes against recapture, and a neutral
Power which allows belligerent prizes access to its ports
under the rule of article 23 would indirectly render
assistance to the naval operations of the belligerent
concerned. For this reason, Great Britain as well as
Japan and Siam entered a reservation against article 23.
Be that as it may, those Powers which have accepted
article 23 will not, I believe, object to the sale in the
neutral port concerned of such sequestrated prizes,
provided they have previously been condemned by the
proper Prize Court.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Levy of Troops, and the like.</p></div>

<p>§ 330. <a name="In_former_centuries330" id="In_former_centuries330"></a>In former centuries neutrals were not required
to prevent belligerents from levying troops on their
neutral territories, and a neutral often used to levy
troops himself on his territory for belligerents without
thereby violating his duty of impartiality as understood
in those times. In this way the Swiss Confederation
frequently used to furnish belligerents, and often both
parties, with thousands of recruits, although she herself
always remained neutral. But at the end of the
eighteenth century a movement was started which
tended to change this practice. In 1793 the United
States of America interdicted the levy of troops on her
territory for belligerents, and by-and-by many other
States followed the example. During the nineteenth
century the majority of writers maintained that the
duty of impartiality must prevent a neutral from
allowing the levy of troops. The few<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> writers who
differed made it a condition that a neutral, if he allowed
such levy at all, must allow it to both belligerents alike.
The controversy is now finally settled, for articles 4
and 5 of Convention V. lay down the rules that corps
of combatants may not be formed, nor recruiting offices
opened, on the territory of a neutral Power, and that
neutral Powers must not allow these acts.</p>

<p>A pendant to the levy of troops on neutral territory
was the granting of Letters of Marque to vessels belonging

may be treated as a pirate, I cannot agree. See
 above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#Private_vessels273">vol. I. § 273</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Passage of Bodies of Men intending to Enlist.</p></div>

<p>§ 331. A neutral is not obliged by his duty of impartiality
to interdict passage through his territory
to men either singly or in numbers who intend to enlist.
Thus in 1870 Switzerland did not object to Frenchmen
travelling through Geneva for the purpose of reaching
French corps or to Germans travelling through Basle
for the purpose of reaching German corps, under the
condition, however, that these men travelled without
arms and uniform. On the other hand, when France
during the Franco-German War organised an office<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> in
Basle for the purpose of sending bodies of Alsatian
volunteers through Switzerland to the South of France,
Switzerland correctly prohibited this on account of the
fact that this <i>official</i> organisation of the passage of whole
bodies of volunteers through her neutral territory was
more or less equal to a passage of troops.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_629_629" id="Footnote_629_629"></a><a href="#FNanchor_629_629"><span class="label">[629]</span></a> See Bluntschli, § 770.</p></div>

<p>The Second Peace Conference has sanctioned this
distinction, for article 6 of Convention V. enacts that
"the responsibility of a neutral Power is not involved
by the mere fact that persons cross the frontier individually
(<i>isolément</i>) in order to offer their services to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
one of the belligerents." An <i>argumentum e contrario</i>
justifies the conclusion that the responsibility of a
neutral <i>is</i> involved in case it does allow men to cross
the frontier in a body in order to enlist in the forces
of a belligerent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Organisation of Hostile Expeditions.</p></div>

<p>§ 332. If the levy and passage of troops, and the
forming of corps of combatants, must be prevented by
a neutral, he is all the more required to prevent the
organisation of a hostile expedition from his territory
against either belligerent. Such organisation takes
place when a band of men combine under a commander
for the purpose of starting from the neutral territory
and joining the belligerent forces. The case, however,
is different, if a number of individuals, not organised
into a body under a commander, start in company from
a neutral State for the purpose of enlisting with one
of the belligerents. Thus in 1870, during the Franco-German
War, 1200 Frenchmen started from New York
in two French steamers for the purpose of joining the
French Army. Although the vessels carried also
96,000 rifles and 11,000,000 cartridges, the United States
did not interfere, since the men were not organised in
a body, and since, on the other hand, the arms and
ammunition were carried in the way of ordinary commerce.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Use of Neutral Territory as Base of Naval Operations.</p></div>

<p>§ 333. <a name="Although_a_neutral333" id="Although_a_neutral333"></a>Although a neutral is not required by his
duty of impartiality to prohibit<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> the passage of belligerent
men of-war through his maritime belt, or the
temporary stay of such vessels in his ports, it is universally
recognised that he must not allow admitted
vessels to make the neutral maritime belt and neutral
ports the base of their naval operations against the
enemy. And article 5 of Convention XIII. enacts that
"belligerents are forbidden to use neutral ports and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
waters as a base of naval operations against their
adversaries." The following rules may be formulated as
emanating from the principle:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A neutral must, so far as is in his power, prevent
belligerent men-of-war from cruising within his portion
of the maritime belt for the purpose of capturing enemy
vessels as soon as they leave this belt. It must, however,
be specially observed that a neutral is not required
to prevent this beyond his power. It is absolutely impossible
to prevent such cruising under all circumstances
and conditions, especially in the case of neutrals who
own possessions in distant parts of the globe. How many
thousands of vessels would be necessary, if Great Britain,
for instance, were unconditionally obliged to prevent
such cruising in every portion of the maritime belt of
all her numerous possessions scattered over all parts
of the globe?</p>

<p>(2) A neutral must prevent a belligerent man-of-war
from leaving a neutral port at the same time as an
enemy man-of-war or an enemy merchantman, or must
make other arrangements which prevent an attack so
soon as both reach the Open Sea.<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Article 16 of Convention
XIII. enacts that there must be an interval
of at least twenty-four hours between the departure of
a belligerent warship and a ship of the other belligerent.</p>

<p>(3) <a name="A_neutral_must3of333" id="A_neutral_must3of333"></a>A neutral must prevent a belligerent man-of-war,
whose crew is reduced from any cause whatever,
from enrolling sailors in his neutral ports, with the
exception of such few hands as are necessary for the
purpose of safely navigating the vessel to the nearest
port of her home State.<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>

<p>(4) A neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war
admitted to his ports or maritime belt from taking
in such a quantity of provisions and coal as would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
enable them to continue their naval operations, for
otherwise he would make it possible for them to cruise
on the Open Sea near his maritime belt for the purpose
of attacking enemy vessels.</p>

<p>There is, however, no unanimity of the Powers
concerning the quantity of provisions and coal which
belligerent men-of-war may be allowed to take in.
Articles 19 and 20 of Convention XIII. of the Second
Peace Conference enact the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Article 19: "Belligerent war-ships may only revictual
in neutral ports or roadsteads to bring up their
supplies to the peace standard. Similarly these vessels
may only ship sufficient fuel to enable them to reach
the nearest port in their own country. They may, on
the other hand, fill up their bunkers built to carry fuel,
when in neutral countries which have adopted this
method of determining the amount of fuel to be supplied.
If in accordance with the law of the neutral
Power, the ships are not supplied with coal within
twenty-four hours of their arrival, the duration of their
permitted stay is extended by twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>Article 20: "Belligerent war-ships which have
shipped fuel in a port belonging to a neutral Power
may not within the succeeding three months replenish
their supply in a port of the same Power."</p>

<p>Great Britain, Japan, and Siam, while they have
accepted article 20,<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> have entered a reservation against
article 19. Great Britain upholds her rule that belligerent
warships shall not be allowed to take in more
provisions and fuel in neutral ports than is necessary
to bring them safely to the nearest port of their own
country.</p>

<p>While, therefore, the matter is not settled, it is agreed
that it makes no difference whether the man-of-war
concerned intends to buy provisions and coal on land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
or to take them in from transport vessels which accompany
or meet her in neutral waters.</p>

<p>(5) A neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war
admitted into his ports or maritime belt from replenishing
with ammunition and armaments, and from
adding to their armaments, as otherwise he would
indirectly assist them in preparing for hostilities
(article 18 of Convention XIII.). And it makes no
difference whether the ammunition and armaments are
to come from the shore or are to be taken in from
transport vessels.</p>

<p>Similarly a neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war
in his ports and roadsteads from carrying out such
repairs as would add in any manner whatever to their
fighting force. The local authorities of the neutral
Power must decide what repairs are absolutely necessary
to make these vessels seaworthy, and such repairs are
allowed, but they must be carried out with the least
possible delay (article 17 of Convention XIII.).</p>

<p>(6) A neutral must prevent belligerent men-of-war
admitted into his ports from remaining there longer
than is necessary for ordinary and legitimate purposes.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
It cannot be said that the rule adopted in 1862 by
Great Britain, and followed by some other maritime
States, not to allow a longer stay than twenty-four
hours, is a rule of International Law. It is left to the
consideration of neutrals to adopt by their Municipal
Law any rule they think fit so long as the admitted
men-of-war do not prolong their stay for any other than
ordinary and legitimate purposes. Article 12 of Convention
XIII. prescribes the twenty-four hours rule
only for those neutral countries which have not special
provisions to the contrary in their Municipal Laws.<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
But it is agreed&mdash;and article 14 of Convention XIII.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
enacts it&mdash;that belligerent men-of-war, except those
exclusively for the time devoted to religious, scientific,
or philanthropic purposes, must not prolong their stay
in neutral ports and waters beyond the time permitted,
except on account of damage or stress of weather. A
neutral would certainly violate his duty of impartiality
if he were to allow belligerent men-of-war to winter in
his ports or to stay there for the purpose of waiting for
other vessels of the fleet or transports.</p>

<p>The rule that a neutral must prevent belligerent
men-of-war from staying too long in his ports or waters,
became of considerable importance during the Russo-Japanese
War, when the Russian Baltic Fleet was on
its way to the Far East. Admiral Rojdestvensky is
said to have stayed in the French territorial waters of
Madagascar from December 1904 till March 1905, for
the purpose of awaiting there a part of the Baltic Fleet
that had set out at a later date. The Press likewise
reported a prolonged stay by parts of the Baltic Fleet
during April 1905 at Kamranh Bay and Hon-kohe Bay
in French Indo-China. Provided the reported facts be
true, France would seem to have violated her duty of
impartiality by not preventing such an abuse of her
neutral ports.</p>

<p>(7) A neutral must prevent more than three men-of-war
belonging to the same belligerent from being
simultaneously in one of his ports or roadsteads unless
his Municipal Law provides the contrary (article 15 of
Convention XIII.).</p>

<p>(8) At the outbreak of war a neutral must warn
all belligerent men-of-war which were in his ports or
roadsteads or in his territorial waters before the outbreak
of war, to depart within twenty-four hours or
within such time as the local law prescribes (article 13<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
of Convention XIII.).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Building and Fitting-out of Vessels intended for Naval
Operations.</p></div>

<p>§ 334. <a name="Whereas_a_neutral334" id="Whereas_a_neutral334"></a>Whereas a neutral is in no<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> wise obliged by
his duty of impartiality to prevent his subjects from
selling armed vessels to the belligerents, such armed
vessels being merely contraband of war, a neutral is
bound to employ the means at his disposal to prevent
his subjects from building, fitting out, or arming, to the
order of either belligerent, vessels intended to be used
as men-of-war, and to prevent the departure from his
jurisdiction of any vessel which, by order of either
belligerent, has been adapted to warlike use.<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> The
difference between selling armed vessels to belligerents,
on the one hand, and building them to order, on the
other hand, is usually defined in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p>An armed ship, being contraband of war, is in no
wise different from other kinds of contraband, provided
she is not manned in a neutral port so that she
can commit hostilities at once after having reached the
Open Sea. A subject of a neutral who builds an armed
ship or arms a merchantman, not to order of a belligerent
but intending to sell her to a belligerent, does
not differ from a manufacturer of arms who intends to
sell them to a belligerent. There is nothing to prevent
a neutral from allowing his subjects to sell armed vessels,
and to deliver them to belligerents, either in a neutral
port or in a port of the belligerent. In the case of the
<i>La Santissima Trinidad</i><a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> (1822), as in that of the

<p>On the other hand, if a subject of a neutral builds
armed ships to order of a belligerent, he prepares
the means of naval operations, since the ships on
sailing outside the territorial waters of the neutral
and taking in a crew and ammunition can at once
commit hostilities. Thus, through carrying out the
order of the belligerent, the neutral territory concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
has been made the base of naval operations.
And as the duty of impartiality includes the obligation of
the neutral to prevent either belligerent from making
neutral territory the base of military or naval operations,
a neutral violates his neutrality by not preventing
his subjects from carrying out an order of a belligerent
for the building and fitting out of men-of-war.</p>

<p>This distinction, although of course logically correct,
is hair-splitting. It only shows that neutral States
ought<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> to be required to prevent their subjects from
supplying arms, ammunition, and the like, to belligerents.
But so long as this progress is not made, the
above distinction will probably continue to be drawn,
in spite of its hair-splitting character.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The <i>Alabama</i> Case and the Three Rules of Washington.</p></div>

<p>§ 335. <a name="The_movement_for335" id="The_movement_for335"></a>The movement for recognition of the fact
that the duty of impartiality requires a neutral to
prevent his subjects from building and fitting out to
order of belligerents vessels intended for naval operations,
began with the famous case of the <i>Alabama</i>. It is
not necessary to go into all the details<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> of this case. It
suffices to say that in 1862, during the American Civil
War, the attention of the British Government was drawn
by the Government of the United States to the fact that
a vessel for warlike purposes was built in England to
order of the insurgents. This vessel, afterwards called
the <i>Alabama</i>, left Liverpool in July 1862 unarmed,
but was met at the Azores by three other vessels, also
coming from England, which supplied her with guns and
ammunition, so that she could at once begin to prey
upon the merchantmen of the United States. On the
conclusion of the Civil War, the United States claimed
damages from Great Britain for the losses sustained by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
her merchant marine through the operations of the
<i>Alabama</i> and other vessels likewise built in England.
Negotiations went on for several years, and finally the
parties entered, on May 8, 1871, into the Treaty of
Washington<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> for the purpose of having their difference
settled by arbitration, five arbitrators to be nominated&mdash;Great
Britain, the United States, Brazil, Italy, and
Switzerland, each choosing one. The treaty contained
three rules, since then known as "The Three Rules
of Washington," to be binding upon the arbitrators,
namely:<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>"A neutral Government is bound&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Firstly.</i> To use due diligence to prevent the fitting
out, arming, or equipping within its jurisdiction, of
any vessel which it has reasonable ground to believe
is intended to cruise or carry on war against a Power

to prevent the departure from its jurisdiction of any
vessel intended to cruise or carry on war as above,
such vessel having been specially adapted in whole or
in part, within such jurisdiction, to warlike use.</p>

<p>"<i>Secondly.</i> Not to permit or suffer either belligerent
to make use of its ports or waters as the base of

<p>In consenting that these rules should be binding
upon the arbitrators, Great Britain expressly declared
that, in spite of her consent, she maintained that these
rules were not recognised rules of International Law
at the time when the case of the <i>Alabama</i> occurred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>

<p>The appointed arbitrators<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> met at Geneva in 1871,

Great Britain never consented. Thus, Great Britain
and the United States, although they agreed upon
the three rules, did not at all agree upon the interpretation
thereof, and they could, therefore, likewise
not agree upon the contents of the communication to
other maritime States stipulated by the Treaty of
Washington. It ought not, therefore, to be said that
the Three Rules of Washington<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> have literally become
universal rules of International Law. Nevertheless,
they were the starting-point of the movement for the
universal recognition of the fact that the duty of impartiality
obliges neutrals to prevent their subjects from
building and fitting out, to order of belligerents, vessels
intended for warlike purposes, and to prevent the departure
from their jurisdiction of any vessel, which, by
order of a belligerent, has been adapted to warlike use.
Particular attention must be paid to the fact that,
although article 8 of Convention XIII. in other respects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
copies almost verbally the first of the Three Rules of
Washington, it differs from it in so far as it replaces
the words "to use due diligence" by "to employ the
means at its disposal." For this reason the construction
put by the Geneva arbitrators upon the term <i>due
diligence</i> cannot find application to the rule of article 8,
the employment of the means at the disposal of a
neutral to prevent the acts concerned being a mere
question of fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>On Neutral Asylum in general.</p></div>

<p>§ 336. <a name="Neutral_territory336" id="Neutral_territory336"></a>Neutral territory, being outside the region
of war,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> offers an asylum to members of belligerent
forces, to the subjects of the belligerents and their
property, and to war material of the belligerents.
Since, according to the present rules of International
Law, the duty of either belligerent to treat neutrals
according to their impartiality must&mdash;the case of
extreme necessity for self-preservation excepted&mdash;prevent
them from violating the territorial supremacy of
neutrals, enemy persons as well as enemy goods are
perfectly safe on neutral territory. It is true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
neither belligerent has a right to demand from a neutral<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
such asylum for his subjects, their property, and his
State property. But neither has he, on the other hand,
any right to demand that a neutral refuse such asylum
to the enemy. The territorial supremacy of the neutral
enables him to use his discretion, and either to grant
or to refuse asylum. However, the duty of impartiality
incumbent upon him must induce a neutral granting
asylum to take all such measures as are necessary to
prevent his territory from being used as a base of hostile
operations.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_651_651" id="Footnote_651_651"></a><a href="#FNanchor_651_651"><span class="label">[651]</span></a> See above, §§ <a href="#Region_of_war70">70</a> and <a href="#The_region_of_war71">71</a>.</p></div>

temporary hospitality in his ports to vessels in distress of either
belligerent is an exception to be discussed below in § 344.</p></div>

<p>Now, neutral territory may be an asylum, first, for
private enemy property; secondly, for public enemy
property, especially war material, cash, and provisions;
thirdly, for private subjects of the enemy; fourthly,
for enemy land forces; and, fifthly, for enemy naval
forces. Details, however, need only be given with
regard to asylum to land forces, war material, and naval
forces. For with regard to private property and private
subjects it need only be mentioned that private war
material brought into neutral territory stands on the
same footing as public war material of a belligerent
brought there, and, further, that private enemy subjects
are safe on neutral territory even if they are claimed
by a belligerent for the committal of war crimes.</p>

<p>Only asylum to land forces and war material will
be discussed here in §§ <a href="#Neutral_territory337">337</a>-341, asylum to naval forces
being reserved for separate discussion in §§ <a href="#Whereas_asylum342">342</a>-348.
As regards asylum to land forces, a distinction must be
made between (1) prisoners of war, (2) single fugitive
soldiers, and (3) troops or whole armies pursued by the
enemy and thereby induced to take refuge on neutral
territory.</p>

of war of either belligerent in so far as they become
free <i>ipso facto</i> by their coming into neutral territory.
And it matters not in which way they come there,
whether they escape from a place of detention and
take refuge on neutral territory, or whether they are
brought as prisoners into such territory by enemy
troops who themselves take refuge there.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

which enters a neutral port is different; see below, § <a href="#The_exterritoriality345">345</a>.</p></div>

<p>The principle that prisoners of war regain their
liberty by coming into neutral territory has been
generally recognised for centuries. An illustration
occurred in 1558, when several Turkish and Barbary
captives escaped from one of the galleys of the Spanish
Armada which was wrecked near Calais, and, although
the Spanish Ambassador claimed them, France considered
them to be freed by the fact of their coming
on her territory, and sent them to Constantinople.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
But has the neutral on whose territory a prisoner has
taken refuge the duty to retain such fugitives and thereby
prevent them from rejoining the enemy army?
Formerly this question was not settled. In 1870,
during the Franco-German War, Belgium answered
the question in the affirmative, and detained a French
non-commissioned officer who had been a prisoner in
Germany and had escaped into Belgian territory with
the intention of rejoining at once the French forces.
Whereas this case was controversial,<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> all writers agreed
that the case was different if escaped prisoners wanted
to remain on the neutral territory. As such refugees
might at any subsequent time wish to rejoin their forces,
the neutral was by his duty of impartiality considered
to be obliged to take adequate measures to prevent their
so doing. There was likewise no unanimity regarding
prisoners brought into neutral territory by enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
forces taking refuge there. It was agreed that such
prisoners became free by being brought into neutral
territory; but whereas some writers<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> maintained that
they could not be detained in case they intended at
once to leave the neutral territory, others asserted that
they must always be detained and that they must
comply with such measures as the neutral considers
necessary to prevent them from rejoining their forces.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_654_654" id="Footnote_654_654"></a><a href="#FNanchor_654_654"><span class="label">[654]</span></a> See Hall, § 226, p. 641, note 1.</p></div>

<p>Article 13 of Convention V. settles the controversy
by enacting that a neutral who receives prisoners of
war who have escaped or who are brought there by troops
of the enemy taking refuge on neutral territory, shall
leave them at liberty, but that, if he allows them to
remain on his territory, he <i>may</i>&mdash;he need not!&mdash;assign
them a place of residence so as to prevent them from
rejoining their forces. Since, therefore, everything is left
to the discretion of the neutral, he will have to take into
account the merits and needs of every case and to take
such steps as he thinks adequate. But so much is
certain that a belligerent may not in every case categorically
demand from a neutral who receives escaped
prisoners, or such as have been brought there by troops
who take refuge, that he should detain them.</p>

<p>The case of prisoners who, with the consent of the
neutral, are transported through neutral territory is
different. Such prisoners do not become free on
entering the neutral territory, but there is no doubt that
a neutral, by consenting to the transport, violates his
duty of impartiality, because such transport is equal
to passage of troops through neutral territory (article 2
of Convention V.).</p>

<p>Attention must, lastly, be drawn to the case where
enemy soldiers are amongst the wounded whom a
belligerent is allowed by a neutral to transport through
neutral territory. Such wounded prisoners become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
free, but they must, according to article 14 of Convention
V., be guarded by the neutral so as to insure
their not again taking part in military operations.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Fugitive Soldiers on Neutral Territory.</p></div>

<p>§ 338. A neutral may grant asylum to single soldiers
of belligerents who take refuge on his territory, although
he need not do so, and may at once send them back to
the place they came from. If he grants such asylum,
his duty of impartiality obliges him to disarm the
fugitives and to take such measures as are necessary
to prevent them from rejoining their forces. But it
must be emphasised that it is practically impossible for
a neutral to be so watchful as to detect every single
fugitive who enters his territory. It will always
happen that such fugitives steal into neutral territory
and leave it again later on to rejoin their forces without
the neutral being responsible. And, before he can
incur responsibility for not doing so, a neutral must
actually be in a position to detain such fugitives. Thus
Luxemburg, during the Franco-German War, could
not prevent hundreds of French soldiers, who, after the
capitulation of Metz, fled into her territory, from rejoining
the French forces; because, according to the
condition<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> of her neutralisation, she is not allowed to
keep an army, and therefore, in contradistinction to
Switzerland and Belgium, was unable to mobilise troops
for the purpose of fulfilling her duty of impartiality.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_658_658" id="Footnote_658_658"></a><a href="#FNanchor_658_658"><span class="label">[658]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutral Territory and Fugitive Troops.</p></div>

<p>§ 339. <a name="On_occasions_during339" id="On_occasions_during339"></a>On occasions during war large bodies of
troops, or even a whole army, are obliged to cross
the neutral frontier for the purpose of escaping captivity.
A neutral need not permit this, and may repulse
them on the spot, but he may also grant asylum.
It is, however, obvious that the presence of such troops
on neutral territory is a danger for the other party.
The duty of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
obliges him, therefore, to disarm such troops at once,
and to guard them so as to insure their not again performing
military acts against the enemy during the
war. Convention V. enacts the following rules:&mdash;</p>

<p>Article 11: "A neutral Power which receives in its
territory troops belonging to the belligerent armies
shall detain them, if possible, at some distance from
the theatre of war. It may keep them in camps, and even
confine them in fortresses or localities assigned for the
purpose. It shall decide whether officers are to be left
at liberty on giving their parole that they will not leave
the neutral territory without authorisation."</p>

<p>Article 12: "In the absence of a special Convention,
the neutral Power shall supply the interned with the
food, clothing, and relief which the dictates of humanity
prescribe. At the conclusion of peace, the expenses
caused by internment shall be made good."</p>

<p>It is usual for troops who are not actually pursued
by the enemy&mdash;for if pursued they have no time for it&mdash;to
enter through their commander into a convention
with the representative of the neutral concerned,
stipulating the conditions upon which they cross the
frontier and give themselves into the custody of the
neutral. Such conventions are valid without needing
ratification, provided they contain only such stipulations
as do not disagree with International Law and as
concern only the requirements of the case.</p>

<p>Stress must be laid on the fact that, although the
detained troops are not prisoners of war captured
by the neutral, they are nevertheless in his custody,
and therefore under his disciplinary power, just as
prisoners of war are under the disciplinary power of
the State which keeps them in captivity. They do
not enjoy the exterritoriality&mdash;see
above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#Wh445">Vol. I. § 445</a>&mdash;due
to armed forces abroad because they are disarmed.
As the neutral is required to prevent them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
escaping, he must apply stern measures, and he may
punish severely every member of the detained force
who attempts to frustrate such measures or does not
comply with the disciplinary rules regarding order,
sanitation, and the like.</p>

<p>The most remarkable instance known in history is
the asylum granted by Switzerland during the Franco-German
War to a French army of 85,000 men with
10,000 horses which crossed the frontier on February 1,
1871.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> France had, after the conclusion of the war,
to pay about eleven million francs for the maintenance
of this army in Switzerland during the rest of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutral Territory and Non-combatant Members of Belligerent

<p>§ 340. The duty of impartiality incumbent upon a

mention any rule concerning this matter.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Neutral Territory and War Material of Belligerents.</p></div>

<p>§ 341. It can happen during war that war material
belonging to one of the belligerents is brought into
neutral territory for the purpose of saving it from
capture by the enemy. Such war material can be
brought by troops crossing the neutral frontier for
the purpose of evading captivity, or it can be purposely
sent there by order of a commander. Now, a neutral
is by no means obliged to admit such material, just as he
is not obliged to admit soldiers of belligerents. But if
he admits it, his duty of impartiality obliges him to
seize and retain it till after the conclusion of peace.
War material includes, besides arms, ammunition, provisions,
horses, means of military transport such as carts
and the like, and everything else that belongs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
equipment of troops. But means of military transport
belong to war material only so far as they are the
property of a belligerent. If they are hired or requisitioned
from private individuals, they may not be
detained by the neutral.</p>

<p>It can likewise happen during war that war material,
originally the property of one of the belligerents but
seized and appropriated by the enemy, is brought by
the latter into neutral territory. Does such material,
through coming into neutral territory, become free,
and must it be restored to its original owner, or must
it be retained by the neutral and after the war be restored
to the belligerent who brought it into the neutral
territory? In analogy with prisoners of war who become
free through being brought into neutral territory,
it is maintained<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> that such war material becomes free
and must be restored to its original owner. To this
however, I cannot agree.<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Since war material becomes
through seizure by the enemy his property and remains
his property unless the other party re-seizes and thereby
re-appropriates it, there is no reason for its reverting to
its original owner upon transportation into neutral
territory.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

a certain hospitality of ports to vessels of all nations a
necessity. Thus the rules of International Law regarding
asylum of neutral ports to men-of-war of belligerents
have developed on somewhat different lines from the
rules regarding asylum to land forces. But the rule,
that the duty of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral
must prevent him from allowing belligerents to use
his territory as a base of operations of war, is nevertheless
valid regarding asylum granted to their men-of-war.</p>

<p>§ 343. Although a neutral may grant asylum to
belligerent men-of-war in his ports, he has no duty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
do so. He may prohibit all belligerent men-of-war
from entering any of his ports, whether these vessels are
pursued by the enemy or desire to enter for other reasons.
However, his duty of impartiality must prevent him
from denying to the one party what he grants to the
other, and he may not, therefore, allow entry to men-of-war
of one belligerent without giving the same permission
to men-of-war of the other belligerent (article
9 of Convention XIII.). Neutrals as a rule admit
men-of-war of both parties, but they frequently exclude
all men-of-war of both parties from entering certain
ports. Thus Austria prohibited during the Crimean
War all belligerent men-of-war from entering the port
of Cattaro. Thus, further, Great Britain prohibited
during the American Civil War the access of all belligerent
men-of-war to the ports of the Bahama Islands,
the case of stress of weather excepted.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, since a neutral must prevent belligerents
from making his territory the base of military
operations, he must not allow an unlimited number of
men-of-war belonging to one of the belligerents to stay
simultaneously in one of his ports. Article 15 of
Convention XIII. limits the number of such men-of-war
to three, unless there are special provisions
to the contrary in the Municipal Law of the neutral
concerned.</p>

<p>§ 344. To the rule that a neutral need not admit
men-of-war of the belligerents to neutral ports there
is no exception in strict law. However, there is an
international usage that belligerent men-of-war in
distress should never be prevented from making for
the nearest port. In accordance with this usage vessels
in distress have always been allowed entry even to
such neutral ports as were totally closed to belligerent
men-of-war. There are even instances known of

<p>Special provision is made by article 24 of Convention
XIII. for the case of a belligerent man-of-war which
refuses to leave a neutral port. This article enacts:&mdash;"If,
notwithstanding the notification of the neutral
Power, a belligerent ship of war does not leave a port
where it is not entitled to remain, the neutral Power
is entitled to take such measures as it considers necessary
to render the ship incapable of putting to sea so long
as the war lasts, and the commanding officer of the
ship must facilitate the execution of such measures.
When a belligerent ship is detained by a neutral Power,
the officers and crew are likewise detained. The officers
and crew so detained may be left in the ship or kept
either on another vessel or on land, and may be subjected
to such measures of restriction as it may appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
necessary to impose upon them. A sufficient number
of men must, however, be always left on board for
looking after the vessel. The officers may be left at
liberty on giving their word not to quit neutral territory
without permission."</p>

<p>If a vessel is granted asylum for the whole time of
the war&mdash;see below, § <a href="#It_would_be_easy347">347</a> (3 and 4)&mdash;and is, therefore,
dismantled, she loses the character of a man-of-war,
no longer enjoys the privilege of exterritoriality due
to men-of-war in foreign waters, and prisoners on board
become free, although they must be detained by the
neutral concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Abuse of
Asylum to
be prohibited.</p></div>

<p>§ 347. <a name="It_would_be_easy347" id="It_would_be_easy347"></a>It would be easy for belligerent men-of-war
to which asylum is granted in neutral ports to abuse
such asylum if neutrals were not required to prohibit
such abuse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) <a name="A_belligerent1of347" id="A_belligerent1of347"></a>A belligerent man-of-war can abuse asylum,
firstly, by ascertaining whether and what kind of
enemy vessels are in the same neutral port, accompanying
them when they leave, and attacking them
immediately they reach the Open Sea. To prevent
such abuse, in the eighteenth century several neutral
States arranged that, if belligerent men-of-war or
privateers met enemy vessels in a neutral port, they
were not to be allowed to leave together, but an interval
of at least twenty-four hours was to elapse between the
sailing of the vessels. During the nineteenth century
this so-called twenty-four hours rule was enforced by
the majority of States, and the Second Peace Conference,
by article 16 of Convention XIII., has made it a general
rule<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> by enacting:&mdash;"When war-ships belonging to
both belligerents are present simultaneously in a neutral
port or roadstead, a period of not less than twenty-four
hours must elapse between the departure of the ship
belonging to one belligerent and the departure of the
ship belonging to the other. The order of departure is
determined by the order of arrival, unless the ship which
arrived first is so circumstanced that an extension of
its stay is permissible. A belligerent war-ship may
not leave a neutral port or roadstead until twenty-four
hours after the departure of a merchant ship flying the
flag of its adversary."</p>

<p>(2) Asylum can, secondly, be abused by wintering
in a port in order to wait for other vessels of the same
fleet, or by similar intentional delay. There is no
doubt that neutrals must prohibit this abuse by ordering
such belligerent men-of-war to leave the neutral
ports. Following the example set by Great Britain in
1862,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> several maritime States have adopted the rule
of not allowing a belligerent man-of-war to stay in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
neutral ports for more than twenty-four hours, except
on account of damage or stress of weather. Other
States, such as France, do not, however, object to a
more prolonged stay in their ports. Article 12 of
Convention XIII. prescribes the twenty-four hours rule
only for those neutral countries which have not special
provisions to the contrary in their Municipal Laws.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>

<p>(3) <a name="Asylum_can3of347" id="Asylum_can3of347"></a>Asylum can, thirdly, be abused by repairing
a belligerent man-of-war which has become unseaworthy.
Although small repairs are allowed,<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> a neutral
would violate his duty of impartiality by allowing such
repairs as would make good the unseaworthiness of a
belligerent man-of-war. During the Russo-Japanese
War this was generally recognised, and the Russian
men-of-war <i>Askold</i> and <i>Grossovoi</i> in Shanghai, the
<i>Diana</i> in Saigon, and the <i>Lena</i> in San Francisco had
therefore to be disarmed and detained. The crews of
these vessels had likewise to be detained for the time of
the war.</p>

<p>(4) <a name="Asylum_can4of347" id="Asylum_can4of347"></a>Asylum can, lastly, be abused by remaining in a
neutral port an undue length of time in order to escape
attack and capture by the other belligerent. Neutral
territorial waters are in fact an asylum for men-of-war
which are pursued by the enemy, but, since nowadays
a right of pursuit into neutral waters, as asserted by
Bynkershoek,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> is no longer recognised, it would be an
abuse of asylum if the escaped vessel were allowed to
make a prolonged stay in the neutral waters. A neutral
who allowed such abuse of asylum would violate his
duty of impartiality, for he would assist one of the
belligerents to the disadvantage of the other.<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
when after the battle off Port Arthur in August
1904 the Russian battleship <i>Cesarewitch</i>, the cruiser
<i>Novik</i>, and three destroyers escaped, and took refuge in
the German port of Tsing-Tau in Kiao-Chau, the <i>Novik</i>,
which was uninjured, had to leave the port after a few
hours,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> whereas the other vessels, which were too
damaged to leave the port, were disarmed and, together
with their crews, detained till the conclusion of peace.
And when, at the end of May 1905, after the battle
of Tsu Shima, three injured Russian men-of-war, the
<i>Aurora</i>, <i>Oleg</i>, and <i>Jemchug</i>, escaped into the harbour
of Manila, the United States of America ordered them
to be disarmed and, together with their crews, to be
detained during the war.</p>

became generally recognised, and article 24 of Convention XIII. places
it beyond all doubt. Until the Russo-Japanese War it was still a
controverted question whether a neutral is obliged either to dismiss or
to disarm and detain such men-of war as had fled into his ports for the
purpose of escaping attack and capture. See Hall, § 231, p. 651, and
Perels, § 39, p. 213, in contradistinction to Fiore, III. No. 1578. The
"Règlement sur le régime légal des navires et de leurs équipages dans
les ports étrangers," adopted by the Institute of International Law in
1898 at its meeting at the Hague&mdash;see <i>Annuaire</i>, XVII. (1898), p.
273&mdash;answers (article 42) the question in the affirmative.</p></div>

neutrals as regards asylum to land and naval forces. Whereas land forces
crossing neutral frontiers must either be at once repulsed or detained,
men-of-war may be granted the right to stay for some limited time within
neutral harbours and to leave afterwards unhindered; see above, § <a href="#Whereas_asylum342">342</a>.
The supply of a small quantity of coal to the <i>Novik</i> in Tsing-Tau was
criticised by writers in the Press, but unjustly. For&mdash;see above, § <a href="#A_belligerent346">346</a>&mdash;a
 neutral may allow a belligerent man-of-war in his port to take in
so much coal as is necessary to navigate her to her nearest home port.</p></div>

<p>§ 348. <a name="It_can_happen348" id="It_can_happen348"></a>It can happen during war that neutral men-of-war
pick up and save from drowning soldiers and
sailors of belligerent men-of-war sunk by the enemy,

asylum for the rescued marines, the question has arisen
whether such rescued marines must be given up to the
enemy, or must be detained during the war, or may be
brought to their home country. Two cases are on
record which illustrate this matter.</p>

<p>(1) At the beginning of the Chino-Japanese War,

soldiers who clung to the mast of the sinking ship were
rescued by the French gunboat <i>Lion</i> and brought to
the Korean harbour of Chemulpo. Hundreds of others
saved themselves on some islands near the spot where
the incident occurred, and 120 of these were taken on
board the German man-of-war <i>Iltis</i> and brought back
to the Chinese port of Tientsin.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

<p>(2) At the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War,
on February 9, 1904, after the Russian cruisers <i>Variag</i>

and returned, crowded with wounded, to Chemulpo,
the British cruiser <i>Talbot</i>, the French <i>Pascal</i>, and the
Italian <i>Elba</i> received large numbers of the crews of the
disabled Russian cruisers. The Japanese demanded
that the neutral ships should give up the rescued men

question, for article 13 of Convention X. enacts:&mdash;"If

<p>§ 349. <a name="The_duty_of_impartiality349" id="The_duty_of_impartiality349"></a>The duty of impartiality must prevent a
neutral from supplying belligerents with arms, ammunition,
vessels, and military provisions.<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> And it matters
not whether such supply takes place for money or
gratuitously. A neutral who sold arms and ammunition
to a belligerent at a profit would violate his duty of
impartiality as also would one who transferred such
arms and ammunition to a belligerent as a present.
This is a settled rule so far as direct transactions regarding
such supply between belligerents and neutrals
are concerned. The case is different where a neutral
does not directly and knowingly deal with a belligerent,
although he may, or ought to, be aware that he is indirectly
supplying a belligerent. Different States have
during neutrality taken up different attitudes regarding
such cases. Thus in 1825, during the War of
Independence which the Spanish South American
Colonies waged against their mother country, the
Swedish Government sold three old men-of-war, the
<i>Försigtigheten</i>, <i>Euridice</i>, and <i>Camille</i> to two merchants,
who on their part sold them to English merchants,
representatives of the Government of the Mexican insurgents.
When Spain complained, Sweden rescinded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
the contract.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> Further, the British Government in 1863,
during the American Civil War, after selling an old
gunboat, the <i>Victor</i>, to a private purchaser and subsequently
finding that the agents of the Confederate States
had obtained possession of her, gave the order that
during the war no more Government ships should be
sold.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> On the other hand, the Government of the
United States of America, in pursuance of an Act passed
by Congress in 1868 for the sale of arms which the end
of the Civil War had rendered superfluous, sold in 1870,
notwithstanding the Franco-German War, thousands
of arms and other war material which were shipped
to France.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> This attitude of the United States is now
generally condemned, and article 6 of Convention XIII.
may be quoted against a repetition of such a practice
on the part of a neutral State. This article prohibits
the supply in any manner, directly or <i>indirectly</i>, by a
neutral to a belligerent, of warships, ammunition, or
war material of any kind whatever.</p>

<p>§ 350. <a name="In_contradistinction350" id="In_contradistinction350"></a>In contradistinction to supply to belligerents
by neutrals, such supply by subjects of neutrals is
lawful, and neutrals are not, therefore, obliged according
to their duty of impartiality to prevent such supply.
Article 7 of Convention V. and article 7 of Convention
XIII. concur in enacting the old customary rule that
"A neutral Power is not bound to prevent the export
or transit, on behalf of one or other of the belligerents,
of arms, munitions of war, or, in general, of anything
which can be of use to an army or fleet." And article 18<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
of Convention V. recognises the fact that the furnishing
of supplies to a belligerent by such subjects of neutrals
as do not live on the territory of the other party, or on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
the territory occupied by that party, does not invest these
individuals with enemy character. When in August
1870, during the Franco-German War, Germany lodged
complaints with the British Government for not prohibiting
its subjects from supplying arms and ammunition
to the French Government, Great Britain correctly
replied that she was not by International Law under
the obligation to prevent her subjects from committing
such acts. Of course, such neutral as is anxious to
avoid all controversy and friction can by his Municipal
Law order his subjects to abstain from such acts, as
for instance Switzerland and Belgium did during the
Franco-German War. But such injunctions arise from
political prudence, and not from any obligation imposed
by International Law.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_689_689" id="Footnote_689_689"></a><a href="#FNanchor_689_689"><span class="label">[689]</span></a> That Great Britain has entered a reservation against
article 18, and the portent of this reservation, has been pointed out
above, in § <a href="#Footnote_143_143">88, p. 109, note 1</a>.</p></div>

<p>The endeavour to make a distinction between
supply in single cases and on a small scale on the one
hand, and, on the other, supply on a large scale, and
to consider only the former lawful,<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> has neither in
theory nor in practice found recognition. As International
Law stands, belligerents may make use of visit,
search, and seizure to protect themselves against conveyance
of contraband by sea to the enemy by subjects
of neutrals. But so far as their neutral home State is
concerned, such subjects may, at the risk of having
their property seized during such conveyance, supply
either belligerent with any amount of arms, ammunition,
coal, provisions, and even with armed ships,<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>
provided always that they deal with the belligerents in
the ordinary way of commerce.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_690_690" id="Footnote_690_690"></a><a href="#FNanchor_690_690"><span class="label">[690]</span></a> See Bluntschli, § 766.</p></div>

 above, § <a href="#Whereas_a_neutral334">334</a>, and below, § <a href="#A_neutral_vessel397">397</a>.</p></div>

<p>The case is different when there is no ordinary commerce
with a belligerent Government and when subjects
of neutrals directly supply a belligerent army or navy,
or parts of them. If, for instance, a belligerent fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
is cruising outside the maritime belt of a neutral, the
latter must prevent vessels of his subjects from bringing
coal, arms, ammunition, and provisions to that
fleet, for otherwise he would allow the belligerent to
make use of neutral resources for naval operations.<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>
But he need not prevent vessels of his subjects from
bringing coal, arms, ammunition, and provisions to
belligerent ports, although the supply is destined for
the navy and the army of the belligerent. He need
not prevent belligerent merchantmen from coming
into his ports and carrying arms and the like, bought
from his subjects, over to the ports of their home State.
And he need not prevent vessels of his subjects from
following a belligerent fleet and supplying it <i>en route</i><a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
with coal, ammunition, provisions, and the like, provided
such supply does not take place in the neutral
maritime belt.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_692_692" id="Footnote_692_692"></a><a href="#FNanchor_692_692"><span class="label">[692]</span></a> See

<p>There is no doubt that, as the law stands at present,
neutrals need not prevent their subjects from supplying
belligerents with arms and ammunition. Yet, on the
other hand, there is no doubt either that such supply
is apt to prolong a war which otherwise would come to
an end at an earlier date. But it will be a long time,
if ever it happens, before it is made a duty of neutrals
to prevent such supply as far as is in their power, and to
punish such of their subjects as engage in it. The profit
derived from such supply being enormous, the members
of the Family of Nations are not inclined to cripple the
trade of their subjects by preventing it. And belligerents
want to have the opportunity of replenishing
with arms and ammunition if they run short of them
during war. The question is merely one of the standard
of public morality.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> If this standard rises, and it becomes
the conviction of the world at large that supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
of arms and ammunition by subjects of neutrals is apt
to lengthen wars, the rule will appear that neutrals must
prevent such supply.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Loans and Subsidies on the part of Neutrals.</p></div>

<p>§ 351. His duty of impartiality must prevent a
neutral from granting a loan to either belligerent.
Vattel's (III. § 110) distinction between such loans as
are granted on interest and such as are not so granted,
and his assertion that loans on the part of neutrals are
lawful if they are granted on interest with the pure
intention of making money, have not found favour
with other writers. Nor do I know any instance of such
loan on interest having occurred during the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>What is valid regarding a loan is all the more valid
regarding subsidies in money granted to a belligerent
on the part of a neutral. Through the granting of
subsidies a neutral becomes as much the ally of the
belligerent as he would by furnishing him with a number
of troops.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Loans and Subsidies on the part of Subjects of Neutrals.</p></div>

<p>§ 352. <a name="It352" id="It352"></a>It was formerly a moot point in the theory
of International Law whether a neutral is obliged by
his duty of impartiality to prevent his subjects from
granting subsidies and loans to belligerents for the
purpose of enabling them to continue the war. Several
writers<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> maintained either that a neutral was obliged
to prevent such loans and subsidies altogether, or at
least that he must prohibit a public subscription on
neutral territory for such loans and subsidies. On the
other hand, a number of writers asserted that, since
money is just as much an article of commerce as goods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
a neutral was in no wise obliged to prevent on his
territory public subscription by his subjects to loans
for the belligerents. In contradistinction to the theory
of International Law, the practice of the States has
beyond doubt established the fact that neutrals need
not prevent on their territory subscription to loans
for belligerents. Thus in 1854, during the Crimean
War, France protested in vain against a Russian loan
being raised in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Hamburg. In
1870, during the Franco-German War, a French loan
was raised in London. In 1877, during the Russo-Turkish
War, no neutral prevented his subjects from
subscribing to the Russian loan. Again, in 1904, during
the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese loans were raised
in London and Berlin, and Russian loans in Paris and
Berlin. The Second Peace Conference, by enacting in
article 7 of Convention V. that a neutral is not bound
to prevent the export ... of anything which can be
of use to an army or fleet, has indirectly recognised
that a neutral need not prevent the subscription on
his territory to loans for belligerents.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_696_696" id="Footnote_696_696"></a><a href="#FNanchor_696_696"><span class="label">[696]</span></a> See Phillimore, III. § 151; Bluntschli, § 768; Heffter, §
148; Kleen, I. § 68. The case of <i>De Wütz</i> v. <i>Hendricks</i> (9 Moore, 586)
quoted by Phillimore in support of his assertion that neutrals must
prevent their subjects from subscribing to a loan for belligerents, is
not decisive, for Lord Chief Justice Best declared only "that it was
contrary to the Law of Nations for persons residing in this country to
enter into any agreements to raise money by way of a loan for the
purpose of <i>supporting subjects of a foreign State in arms against a
Government in alliance with our own</i>."</p></div>

<p>But matters differ somewhat in regard to subsidies
to belligerents by subjects of neutrals. A neutral is
not indeed obliged to prevent individual subjects from
granting subsidies to belligerents, just as he is not
obliged to prevent them from enlisting with either
belligerent. But if he were to allow on his territory a
public appeal for subscriptions to such subsidy, he
would certainly violate his duty of impartiality; for
loans are a matter of commerce, subsidies are not.
It must, however, be emphasised that public appeals
for subscriptions of money for charitable purposes in
favour of the wounded, the prisoners, and the like,
need not be prevented, even if they are only made in
favour of one of the belligerents.</p>

<p>The distinction between loans and subsidies is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
certainly correct as the law stands at present. But
there is no doubt that the fact of belligerents having
the opportunity of getting loans from subjects of neutrals
is apt to lengthen wars. The Russo-Japanese War, for
instance, would have come to an end much sooner if
either belligerent could have been prevented from
borrowing money from subjects of neutrals. Therefore,
what has been said above in § <a href="#In_contradistinction350">350</a> with regard to the
supply of arms and ammunition on the part of subjects
of neutrals applies likewise to loans: they will no
longer be considered lawful when the standard of public
morality rises.</p>

<p>§ 353. <a name="Since_pilots_are353" id="Since_pilots_are353"></a>Since pilots are in the service of littoral
States the question as to whether neutrals may permit
their pilots to render services to belligerent men-of-war
and transport vessels, is of importance. Article 11<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
of Convention XIII. enacts that "a neutral Power may
allow belligerent war-ships to employ its licensed
pilots." Since, therefore, everything is left to the
discretion of neutrals, they will have to take the merits
and needs of every case into account. There would
certainly be no objection to a neutral allowing belligerent
vessels to which asylum is legitimately granted, to be
piloted into his ports, and likewise such vessels to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
piloted through his maritime belt if their passage is not
prohibited. But a belligerent might justly object to
the men-of-war of his adversary being piloted on the
Open Sea by pilots of a neutral Power, except in a case
of distress.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_697_697" id="Footnote_697_697"></a><a href="#FNanchor_697_697"><span class="label">[697]</span></a> Germany has entered a reservation against article 11.</p></div>

<p>It is worth mentioning that Great Britain during
the Franco-German War in 1870, prohibited her pilots
from conducting German and French men-of-war which
were outside the maritime belt, except when in distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Transport
on the
part of
Neutrals.</p></div>

<p>§ 354. It is generally recognised that the duty
of impartiality incumbent upon a neutral obliges
him to prevent his men-of-war and other public vessels
from rendering transport services to either belligerent.
Therefore, such vessels must neither carry soldiers nor
sailors belonging to belligerent forces, nor their prisoners
of war, nor ammunition, military or naval provisions,
nor despatches. The question as to how far such vessels
are prevented from carrying enemy subjects other than
members of the forces depends upon the question whether
by carrying those individuals they render such service
to one of the belligerents as is detrimental to the other.
Thus, when the Dutch Government in 1901, during the
South African War, intended to send a man-of-war,
the <i>Gelderland</i>, to President Kruger for the purpose of
conveying him to Europe, they made sure in advance
that Great Britain did not object.</p>

<p>The question has been raised<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> as to whether a
neutral whose rolling stock runs on the railway lines
of a belligerent, may continue to leave such rolling
stock there although it is being used for the transport
of troops, war material, and the like. The answer, I
believe, ought to be in the negative, for there is no doubt
that, if the rolling stock remains on the railway lines of
a belligerent, the neutral concerned is indirectly rendering
transport services to the belligerent. It is for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
this reason that article 19 of Convention V. enacts
that railway material coming from the territory of
neutrals shall not be requisitioned or used by a belligerent
except in the case and to the extent required by
absolute necessity.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Transport on the part of Neutral Merchantmen and by neutral
rolling stock.</p></div>

<p>§ 355. Just as a neutral is not obliged to prevent
his merchantmen from carrying contraband, so he is
not obliged to prevent them from rendering services
to belligerents by carrying in the way of trade enemy
troops, and the like, and enemy despatches. Neutral
merchantmen rendering such services to belligerents
do so at their own risk, for these are unneutral services
for which the merchantmen may be punished<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> by the
belligerents, but for which the neutral State under
whose flag such merchantmen sail bears no responsibility
whatever.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_700_700" id="Footnote_700_700"></a><a href="#FNanchor_700_700"><span class="label">[700]</span></a> See below, §§ <a href="#Before_the_Declaration407">407</a>-413.</p></div>

<p>And the same is valid with regard to rolling stock
belonging to private railway companies of a neutral
State. That such rolling stock may not, without the
consent of the companies owning it, be made use of by
a belligerent for the transport of troops, war material,
and the like, except in the case of and to the extent
required by absolute necessity, follows from article 19
of Convention V. But, if a private railway company
gives its consent, and if its rolling stock is made use
of for warlike purposes, it acquires enemy character,
article 19 of Convention V. does not apply, and the

<div class="sidenote"><p>Information regarding Military and Naval Operations.</p></div>

<p>§ 356. <a name="Information_regarding356" id="Information_regarding356"></a>Information regarding military and naval
operations may be given and obtained in so many
various ways that several cases must be distinguished:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) It is obvious that the duty of impartiality incumbent
upon a neutral obliges him to prevent his men-of-war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
from giving any information to a belligerent concerning
naval operations of the other party. But a
neutral bears no responsibility whatever for private
vessels sailing under his flag which give such information.
Such vessels run, however, the risk of being
punished for rendering unneutral service.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_702_702" id="Footnote_702_702"></a><a href="#FNanchor_702_702"><span class="label">[702]</span></a> See below, §§ <a href="#Either_belligerent409">409</a> and <a href="#In_contradistinction410">410</a>, and articles 45, Nos. 1 and 2,
and 46, No. 4, of the Declaration of London.</p></div>

<p>(2) It is likewise obvious that his duty of impartiality
must prevent a neutral from giving information
concerning the war to a belligerent through his diplomatic
envoys, couriers, and the like. But the question
has been raised as to whether a neutral is obliged to
prevent couriers<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> from carrying despatches for a
belligerent over his neutral territory. I believe the
answer must be in the negative, at least so far as those
couriers in the service of diplomatic envoys and such
agents as carry despatches from a State to its head or
to diplomatic envoys abroad are concerned. Since
they enjoy&mdash;as stated
 above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#To405">Vol. I. §§ 405</a>
and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#In457">457</a>&mdash;inviolability
for their persons and official papers, a
neutral cannot interfere and find out whether these
individuals carry information to the disadvantage of
the enemy.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_703_703" id="Footnote_703_703"></a><a href="#FNanchor_703_703"><span class="label">[703]</span></a> See Calvo, § 2640.</p></div>

<p>(3) According to article 8 of Convention V. "a
neutral Power is not bound to forbid or restrict the
employment, on behalf of belligerents, of telegraph or
telephone cables, or of wireless telegraphy apparatus
whether belonging to it, or to companies, or to private
individuals." Since, therefore, everything is left to
the discretion of the neutral concerned, he will have
to take the merits and needs of every case into consideration,
and act accordingly. But so much is
certain that a belligerent may not categorically request
neutrals to forbid or restrict such employment of their
telegraph wires and the like on the part of his adversary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>The case is different when a belligerent intends to
arrange the transmitting of messages through a submarine
cable purposely laid over neutral territory
or through telegraph and telephone wires purposely
erected on neutral territory. This would seem to be
an abuse of neutral territory, and the neutral must
prevent it. Accordingly, when in 1870, during the
Franco-German War, France intended to lay a telegraph
cable from Dunkirk to the North of France,
the cable to go across the Channel to England and
from there back to France, Great Britain refused her
consent on account of her neutrality. And again in
1898, during war between Spain and the United States
of America, when the latter intended to land at Hong
Kong a cable proposed to be laid from Manila, Great
Britain refused her consent.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_704_704" id="Footnote_704_704"></a><a href="#FNanchor_704_704"><span class="label">[704]</span></a> See Lawrence, <i>War</i>, p. 219.</p></div>

<p>The case is likewise different when a belligerent
intends to erect in a neutral country, or in a neutral
port or neutral waters, a wireless telegraphy station or
any apparatus intended as a means of communication
with belligerent forces on land or sea, or to make use
of any installation of this kind established by him before
the outbreak of war for purely military purposes, and
not previously opened for the service of the public
generally. According to articles 3 and 5 of Convention
V. and article 5 of Convention XIII., a neutral is bound
to prohibit this. The case which occurred in 1904,
during the Russo-Japanese War and the siege of Port
Arthur, when the Russians installed an apparatus for
wireless telegraphy in Chifu and communicated thereby
with the besieged, constituted a violation of neutrality.</p>

<p>(4) It is obvious that his duty of impartiality must
prevent a neutral from allowing belligerents to establish
intelligence bureaux on his territory. On the other
hand, a neutral is not obliged to prevent his subjects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
from giving information to belligerents, be it by letter,
telegram, telephone, or wireless telegraphy. In especial
a neutral is not obliged to prevent his subjects from
giving information to belligerents by wireless telegraphy
apparatus installed on a neutral merchantman. Such
individuals run, however, the risk of being punished as
spies, provided they act clandestinely or under false
pretences, and the vessel concerned is subject to the
risk of being captured and confiscated for rendering
unneutral service.</p>

<p>Stress must be laid on the fact that newspaper
correspondents making use of wireless telegraphy from
on board neutral merchantmen for the purpose of
sending news to their papers,<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> may not be treated as
spies, and the merchantmen concerned may not be confiscated,
although belligerents need by no means allow
the presence of such vessels at the seat of war. Thus,
during the Russo-Japanese War, the <i>Haimun</i>, a vessel
fitted with a wireless telegraphy apparatus for the
service of the <i>Times</i>, was ordered away by the Japanese.
But, of course, an individual can at the same time be a
correspondent for a neutral newspaper and a spy, and
he may then be punished for espionage.</p>

and in

the Term.</p></div>

<p>§ 357. <a name="Many_writers_who357" id="Many_writers_who357"></a>Many writers who speak of violation of
neutrality treat under this head only of violations of
the duty of impartiality incumbent upon neutrals.
And indeed such violations only are meant, if one
speaks of violation of neutrality in the narrower sense
of the term. However, it is necessary for obvious
reasons to discuss not only violations of the duty of
impartiality of neutrals, but violations of all duties
deriving from neutrality, whether they are incumbent
upon neutrals or upon belligerents. In the wider
sense of the term violation of neutrality comprises,
therefore, every performance or omission of an act
contrary to the duty of a neutral towards either belligerent
as well as contrary to the duty of either belligerent
towards a neutral. Everywhere in this treatise
the term is used in its wider sense.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that violations of
neutrality on the part of belligerents must not be confounded
with violations of the laws of war by which
subjects of neutral States suffer damage. If, for instance,
an occupant levies excessive contributions from
subjects of neutral States domiciled in enemy country
in contravention of article 49 of the Hague Regulations,
this is a violation of the Laws of War, for which, according
to article 3 of Convention IV., the belligerent concerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
must pay compensation, but it is not a violation
of neutrality.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Violation

Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 358. <a name="Violation_of_neutrality358" id="Violation_of_neutrality358"></a>Violation of neutrality must not be confounded
with the ending of neutrality,<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> for neither a
violation on the part of a neutral<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> nor a violation on
the part of a belligerent brings <i>ipso facto</i> neutrality to
an end. If correctly viewed, the condition of neutrality
continues to exist between a neutral and a belligerent
in spite of a violation of neutrality. It must be emphasised
that a violation of neutrality contains nothing
more than a breach of a duty deriving from the condition
of neutrality. This applies not only to violations
of neutrality by negligence, but also to those by intention.
Even in an extreme case in which the violation
of neutrality is so great that the offended party
considers war the only adequate measure in answer to
it, it is not the violation which brings neutrality to an
end, but the determination of the offended party. For
there is no violation of neutrality so great as to oblige
the offended party to make war in answer to it, such
party having always the choice whether it will keep
up the condition of neutrality or not.</p>

between the violation of the duty of impartiality incumbent upon
neutrals on the one hand, and on the other, the ending of neutrality, is
usually not made.</p></div>

<p>But this applies only to mere violations of neutrality,
and not to hostilities. The latter are acts of war and
bring neutrality to an end; they have been characterised
in contradistinction to mere violations above in

<div class="sidenote"><p>Consequences

<p>§ 359. Violations of neutrality, whether committed
by a neutral against a belligerent or by a belligerent
against a neutral, are international delinquencies.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>
They may at once be repulsed, the offended party
may require the offender to make reparation, and, if
this is refused, it may take such measures as it thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
adequate to exact the necessary reparation.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> If the
violation is only slight and unimportant, the offended
State will often merely complain. If, on the other hand,
the violation is very substantial and grave, the offended
State will perhaps at once declare that it considers
itself at war with the offender. In such case it is not
the violation of neutrality which brings neutrality to
an end, but the declaration of the offended State that
it considers the violation of so grave a character as to
oblige it to regard itself at war with the offender.</p>

<p>That a violation of neutrality can only, like any
other international delinquency, be committed by malice
or culpable negligence,<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> and that it can be committed
through a State's refusing to comply with the consequences
of its "vicarious" responsibility for acts of
its agents or subjects,<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> is a matter of course. Thus,
if a belligerent fleet attacks enemy vessels in neutral
territorial waters without an order from its Government,
the latter bears "vicarious" responsibility for this
violation of neutral territory on the part of its fleet.
If the Government concerned refuses to disown the
act of its fleet and to make the necessary reparation,
this "vicarious" responsibility turns into "original"
responsibility, for a case of violation of neutrality and
an international delinquency has then arisen. And
the same is valid if an agent of a neutral State without
an order of his Government commits such an act as
would constitute a violation of neutrality in case it
were ordered by the Government; for instance, if
the head of a province of a neutral, without thereto
being authorised by his Government, allows forces of a
belligerent to march through this neutral territory.</p>

<p>§ 360. <a name="It_is_entirely360" id="It_is_entirely360"></a>It is entirely within the discretion of a belligerent
whether he will acquiesce in a violation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
neutrality committed by a neutral in favour of the other
belligerent. On the other hand, a neutral may not
exercise the same discretion regarding a violation of
neutrality committed by one belligerent and detrimental
to the other. His duty of impartiality rather
obliges him in the first instance to prevent, with the
means at his disposal, the belligerent concerned from
committing such violation; for instance, to repulse
an attack of men-of-war of a belligerent on enemy
vessels in neutral ports. Thus article 3 of Convention
XIII. enacts:&mdash;"When a ship has been captured in the
territorial waters of a neutral Power, such Power must,
if the prize is still within its jurisdiction, employ the
means at its disposal to release the prize with its officers
and crew, and to intern the prize crew." And in case
he could not prevent and repulse a violation of his
neutrality, the same duty obliges him to exact due
reparation from the offender,<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> for otherwise he would
favour the one party to the detriment of the other. If
a neutral neglects this obligation, he is thereby committing
a violation of neutrality on his part for which
he may be made responsible by such belligerent as has
suffered through the violation of neutrality committed
by the other belligerent and acquiesced in by the
neutral. For instance, if belligerent men-of-war seize
enemy vessels in ports of a neutral, and if the neutral,
who could not or did not prevent this, exacts no reparation
from the belligerent concerned, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
party may make the neutral responsible for the losses
sustained.</p>

nowadays universally recognised, but before the nineteenth century it
did not exist, although the rule that belligerents must not commit
hostilities on neutral territory, and in especial in neutral ports and
waters, was well recognised. That in spite of its recognition this rule
was in the eighteenth century frequently infringed by commanders of
belligerent fleets, may be illustrated by many cases. Thus, for
instance, in 1793, the French frigate <i>Modeste</i> was captured in the
harbour of Genoa by two British men-of-war (see Hall, § 220). And in
1801, during war against Sweden, a British frigate captured the <i>Freden</i>
and three other Swedish vessels in the Norwegian harbour of Oster-Risoer
(see Ortolan, II. pp. 413-418).</p></div>

<p>§ 361. <a name="Some361" id="Some361"></a>Some writers<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> maintain that a neutral is
freed from responsibility for a violation of neutrality
through a belligerent attacking enemy forces in neutral
territory, in case the attacked forces, instead of trusting
for protection or redress to the neutral, defend themselves
against the attack. This rule is adopted from
the arbitral award in the case of the <i>General Armstrong</i>.
In 1814, during war between Great Britain and the
United States of America, the American privateer
<i>General Armstrong</i>, lying in the harbour of Fayal,
an island belonging to the Portuguese Azores, defended
herself against an attack of an English squadron, but
was nevertheless captured. The United States claimed
damages from Portugal because the privateer was
captured in a neutral Portuguese port. Negotiations
went on for many years, and the parties finally agreed
in 1851 upon arbitration to be given by Louis Napoleon,
then President of the French Republic. In 1852
Napoleon gave his award in favour of Portugal, maintaining
that, although the attack on the privateer in
neutral waters comprised a violation of neutrality,
Portugal could not be made responsible, on account of
the fact that the attacked privateer chose to defend
herself instead of demanding protection from the
Portuguese authorities.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> It is, however, not at all

<div class="sidenote"><p>Mode of exacting Reparation from Belligerents for Violations
of Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 362. It is obvious that the duty of a neutral not
to acquiesce in violations of neutrality committed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
one belligerent to the detriment of the other obliges
him to repair, so far as he can, the result of such wrongful
acts. Thus, he must liberate<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> a prize taken in his
neutral waters, or prisoners made on his territory, and
the like. In so far, however, as he cannot, or not
sufficiently, undo the wrong done, he must exact reparation
from the offender. Now, no general rule can
be laid down regarding the mode of exacting such reparation,
since everything depends upon the merits of
the individual case. Only as regards capture of enemy
vessels in neutral waters has a practice grown up,
which must be considered binding, and according to
which the neutral must claim the prize, and eventually
damages, from the belligerent concerned, and must
restore her to the other party. Thus in 1800, during
war between Great Britain and the Netherlands,
Prussia claimed before the British Prize Court the
<i>Twee Gebroeders</i>,<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> a Dutch vessel captured by the
British cruiser <i>L'Espiègle</i> in the neutral maritime belt
of Prussia. Sir William Scott ordered restoration of
the vessel, yet he refused costs and damages, because
the captor had not violated Prussian neutrality intentionally
but only by mistake and misapprehension.
Thus again, in 1805, during war between Great Britain
and Spain, the United States claimed before the British
Prize Court the <i>Anna</i>,<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> a Spanish vessel captured by
the English privateer <i>Minerva</i> within their neutral
maritime belt. Thus, further, in 1864, during the
American Civil War, when the Confederate cruiser
<i>Florida</i> was captured by the Federal cruiser <i>Wachuset</i>
in the neutral Brazilian port of Bahia, Brazil claimed
the prize. As the latter had sunk while at anchor in
Hampton Roads, she could not be restored, but the

<p>§ 363. <a name="Apart_from_intentional363" id="Apart_from_intentional363"></a>Apart from intentional violations of neutrality,
a neutral can be made responsible only for such
acts favouring or damaging a belligerent as he could
by due diligence have prevented, and which by culpable
negligence he failed to prevent. It is by no means
obligatory for a neutral to prevent such acts under all
circumstances and conditions. This is in fact impossible,
and it becomes more obviously so the larger
a neutral State, and the longer its boundary lines. So
long as a neutral exercises due diligence for the purpose
of preventing such acts, he is not responsible in case
they are nevertheless performed. However, the term
<i>due diligence</i> has become controversial through the
definition proffered by the United States of America
in interpreting the Three Rules of Washington, and
through the Geneva Court of Arbitration adopting such
interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> According to this interpretation the
<i>due diligence</i> of a neutral <i>must be in proportion to the
risks to which either belligerent may be exposed from
failure to fulfil the obligations of neutrality on his part</i>.
Had this interpretation been generally accepted, the
most oppressive obligations would have become incumbent
upon neutrals. But no such general acceptance
has taken place. The fact is that <i>due diligence</i>
in International Law can have no other meaning than
it has in Municipal Law. It means <i>such diligence as can
reasonably be expected when all the circumstances and
conditions of the case are taken into consideration</i>.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the Second Peace Conference has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
taken a step which certainly excludes for the future
the continuation of the controversy regarding the
interpretation of <i>due diligence</i>, for articles 8 and 25 of
Convention XIII., instead of stipulating due diligence
on the part of neutrals, stipulate <i>the employment of
the means at their disposal</i>.</p>

<p>§ 363<i>a</i>. <a name="In_order_to_defend363a" id="In_order_to_defend363a"></a>In order to defend themselves against
possible violations of their neutral territory, neutrals
may lay automatic contact mines off their coasts. If
they do this, they must, according to article 4 of
Convention VIII., observe the same rules and take the
same precautions as are imposed upon belligerents,
and as have been expounded above, § 182<i>a</i>. Moreover
they must, according to paragraph 2 of article 4 of

<p>Convention VIII. is quite as unsatisfactory in its
rules concerning mines laid by neutrals as in its rules
concerning mines laid by belligerents, and the danger
to neutral shipping created by mines laid by neutrals
is very great, all the more as the laying of mines by
neutrals is not restricted to their maritime belt. For
article 4 of Convention VIII. speaks of the laying of
contact mines on the part of neutral Powers <i>off their
coasts</i>, without limiting the laying within the three-mile
wide maritime belt as was proposed at the Second
Peace Conference, and as article 6<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> of the <i>Règlementation

Right
of Angary.</p></div>

<p>§ 364. <a name="Under_the364" id="Under_the364"></a>Under the term <i>jus angariae</i><a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> many writers
on International Law place the right, often claimed
and practised in former times, of a belligerent deficient
in vessels to lay an <i>embargo</i> on and seize neutral merchantmen
in his harbours, and to compel them and
their crews to transport troops, ammunition, and
provisions to certain places on payment of freight in
advance.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> This practice arose in the Middle Ages,<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>
and was made much use of by Louis XIV. of France.
To save the vessels of their subjects from seizure under
the right of angary, States began in the seventeenth
century to conclude treaties by which they renounced
such right with regard to each other's vessels. Thereby
the right came into disuse during the eighteenth century.
Many writers<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> assert, nevertheless, that it is not obsolete,
and might be exercised even to-day. But I doubt
whether the Powers would concede to one another the
exercise of such a right. The facts that no case happened
in the nineteenth century and that International
Law with regard to rights and duties of neutrals has
become much more developed during the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
and nineteenth centuries, would seem to justify the
opinion that such angary is now probably obsolete,<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Modern Right of Angary.</p></div>

<p>§ 365. <a name="In_contradistinction365" id="In_contradistinction365"></a>In contradistinction to this probably obsolete
right to compel neutral ships and their crews to render
certain services, the modern right of angary consists
in the right of belligerents to make use of, or destroy
in case of necessity, <i>for the purpose of offence and
defence</i>, neutral property on their own or on enemy
territory or on the Open Sea. In case property of
subjects of neutral States is vested with enemy character,<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>
it is not neutral property in the strict sense of
the term neutral, and all rules respecting appropriation,
utilisation, and destruction of enemy property obviously
apply to it. The object of the right of angary
is <i>such property of subjects of neutral States as retains
its neutral character from its temporary position on belligerent
territory and which therefore is not vested with
enemy character</i>. All sorts of neutral property, whether
it consists of vessels or other<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> means of transport, or
arms, ammunition, provisions, or other personal property,
may be the object of the right of angary, provided
the articles concerned are serviceable to military ends
and wants. The conditions under which the right may
be exercised are the same as those under which private
enemy property may be utilised or destroyed, but in
every case the neutral owner must be fully indemnified.<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_728_728" id="Footnote_728_728"></a><a href="#FNanchor_728_728"><span class="label">[728]</span></a> See above, § <a href="#Page_90">90</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_729_729" id="Footnote_729_729"></a><a href="#FNanchor_729_729"><span class="label">[729]</span></a> Thus in 1870, during the Franco-German War, the Germans
seized hundreds of Swiss and Austrian railway carriages in France and
made use of them for military purposes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_730_730" id="Footnote_730_730"></a><a href="#FNanchor_730_730"><span class="label">[730]</span></a> See article 6 of U.S. Naval War Code:&mdash;"If military
necessity should require it, neutral vessels found within the limits of
belligerent authority may be seized and destroyed, or otherwise used for
military purposes, but in such cases the owners of the neutral vessels
must be fully recompensed. The amount of the indemnity should, if
practicable, be agreed upon in advance with the owner or master of the
vessel; due regard must be had for treaty stipulations upon these
matters." See also Holland, <i>War</i>, No. 140.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p></div>

<p>A remarkable case<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> happened in 1871 during the
Franco-German War. The Germans seized some
British coal-vessels lying in the river Seine at Duclair,
and sank them for the purpose of preventing French
gunboats from running up the river. On the intervention
of the British Government, Count Bismarck
refused to recognise the duty of Germany to indemnify
the owners of the vessels sunk, although he agreed to
pay indemnities.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_731_731" id="Footnote_731_731"></a><a href="#FNanchor_731_731"><span class="label">[731]</span></a> See Albrecht, <i>op. cit.</i> pp. 45-48.</p></div>

<p>However, it may safely be maintained that a duty
to pay indemnities for any damage done by exercising
the right of angary must nowadays be recognised.
Article 53 of the Hague Regulations stipulates the
payment of indemnities for the seizure and utilisation
of all appliances adapted to the transport of persons or
goods which are the private property of inhabitants of
occupied enemy territory, and article 52 of the Hague
Regulations stipulates payment for requisitions; if,
thus, the immunity from confiscation of private property
of inhabitants is recognised, all the more must
that of private neutral property temporarily on occupied
enemy territory be recognised also.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Right of Angary concerning Neutral Rolling Stock.</p></div>

<p>§ 366. A special case of the right of angary has
found recognition by article 19 of Convention V. of
the Second Peace Conference enacting that railway
material coming from the territory of a neutral Power,
whether belonging to the neutral State or to companies
or private persons, shall not be requisitioned or utilised
by a belligerent, <i>except in the case of and to the extent
required by absolute necessity</i>, that it shall as soon as
possible be sent back to the country of origin, and that
compensation shall be paid for its use.<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> But it must
be mentioned that article 19 gives a right to a neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
Power, whose railway material has been requisitioned
by a belligerent, to retain and make use of, to a corresponding
extent, railway material coming from the
territory of the belligerent concerned.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_732_732" id="Footnote_732_732"></a><a href="#FNanchor_732_732"><span class="label">[732]</span></a> See Nowacki, <i>Die Eisenbahnen im Kriege</i> (1906), pp.
115-126, and Albrecht, <i>op. cit.</i> pp. 22-24.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Right of Angary not deriving from Neutrality.</p></div>

<p>§ 367. Whatever the extent of the right of angary
may be, it does not derive from the law of neutrality.
The correlative duty of a belligerent to indemnify the
neutral owner of property appropriated or destroyed
by the exercise of the right of angary does indeed derive
from the law of neutrality. But the right of angary
itself is rather a right deriving from the law of war.
As a rule this law gives, under certain circumstances
and conditions, the right to a belligerent to seize, make
use of, or destroy private property of inhabitants only
of occupied enemy territory, but under other circumstances
and conditions, and very exceptionally, it
likewise gives a belligerent the right to seize, use, or
destroy such neutral property as is temporarily on
occupied enemy territory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Definition
of
Blockade.</p></div>

<p>§ 368. <a name="Blockade_is_the_blocking368" id="Blockade_is_the_blocking368"></a>Blockade is the blocking by men-of-war<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> of
the approach to the enemy coast or a part of it for
the purpose of preventing ingress and egress of vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
of all nations. Blockade must not be confounded
with siege, although it may take place concurrently with
siege. Whereas siege aims at the capture of the besieged
place, blockade endeavours merely to intercept
all intercourse, and especially commercial intercourse,
by sea between the coast and the world at large.
Although blockade is, as shown above in §§ <a href="#The_purpose_of_war173">173</a> and
174, a means of warfare against the enemy, it concerns
neutrals as well, because the ingress and egress of
neutral vessels are thereby interdicted and may be
punished.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_733_733" id="Footnote_733_733"></a><a href="#FNanchor_733_733"><span class="label">[733]</span></a> When in 1861, during the American Civil War, the Federal
Government blocked the harbour of Charleston by sinking ships laden with
stone, the question arose whether a so-called stone-blockade is lawful.
There ought to be no doubt&mdash;see below, § <a href="#The_condition_of380">380</a>&mdash;that such a stone-blockade
is not a blockade in the ordinary sense of the term, and that neutral
ships may not be seized and confiscated for having attempted egress or
ingress. But, on the other hand, there ought to be no doubt either that
this mode of obstructing an enemy port is as lawful as any other means
of sea warfare, provided the blocking of the harbour is made known so
that neutral vessels can avoid the danger of being wrecked. See Wharton,
III. § 361<span class="smcap">A</span>; Fauchille, <i>Blocus</i>, pp. 143-145; Perels, § 35, p. 187.</p></div>

<p>Blockade in the modern sense of the term is an
institution which could not develop until neutrality
was in some form a recognised institution of the Law
of Nations, and until the freedom of neutral commerce
was in some form guaranteed. The institution of
blockade dates from the sixteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> but it has
taken several hundred years for the institution to
reach its present condition, since, until the beginning
of the nineteenth century, belligerents frequently made
use of so-called paper blockades, which are no longer

<p>It is on account of the practical importance of
blockade for the interests of neutrals that the matter
is more conveniently treated with neutrality than
with war. And it must be noted that blockade as a
means of warfare must not be confounded with so-called
pacific blockade, which is a means of compulsive
settlement of State differences.</p>

<p>Apart from the stipulation of the Declaration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
Paris that a blockade to be binding must be effective,
no conventional rules concerning blockade were in
existence until the Declaration of London, nor was the
practice of the States governed by common rules
covering all the points concerned. But articles 1-21
of the Declaration of London now offer a code of the
law of blockade and will, should this Declaration be
ratified, in time produce a common practice of all
maritime States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Blockade,
Strategic
and Commercial.</p></div>

<p>§ 369. A blockade is termed strategic if it forms
part of other military operations directed against the
coast which is blockaded, or if it be declared in order
to cut off supply to enemy forces on shore. In contradistinction
to blockade strategic, one speaks of a
commercial blockade, when a blockade is declared
simply in order to cut off the coast from intercourse
with the outside world, although no military operations
take place on shore. That blockades commercial
are, according to the present rules of International
Law, as legitimate as blockades strategic, is not generally
denied. But several writers<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> maintain that
blockades purely commercial ought to be abolished as
not in accordance with the guaranteed freedom of
neutral commerce during war.</p>

to be
Universal.</p></div>

<p>§ 370. <a name="A_blockade_is_really370" id="A_blockade_is_really370"></a>A blockade is really in being when vessels
of all nations are interdicted and prevented from
ingress or egress. Blockade as a means of warfare is
admissible only in the form of a <i>universal</i> blockade,
that is&mdash;as article 5 of the Declaration of London
stipulates&mdash;it "must be applied impartially to the
vessels of all nations." If the blockading belligerent
were to allow the ingress or egress of vessels of one
nation, no blockade would exist.<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

Spinks, 287. See also below, § <a href="#A_blockade_is_effective382">382</a>.</p></div>

<p>On the other hand, provided a blockade is universal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
a special licence of ingress or egress may be
given to a special vessel and for a particular purpose,<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>

to pass to and fro unhindered.<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Thus, when during
the American Civil War the Federal Government
blockaded the coast of the Confederate States, neutral
men-of-war were not prevented from ingress and egress.
But it must be specially observed that a belligerent has
a right to prevent neutral men-of-war from passing
through the line of blockade, and it is entirely within
his discretion whether or not he will admit or exclude
them; nor is he compelled to admit them all, even
though he has admitted one or more of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Blockade, Outwards and Inwards.</p></div>

<p>§ 371. As a rule a blockade is declared for the
purpose of preventing ingress as well as egress. But
sometimes only ingress or only egress is prevented. In
such cases one speaks of "Blockade inwards" and of
"Blockade outwards" respectively. Thus the blockade
of the mouth of the Danube declared by the Allies in
1854 during the Crimean War was a "blockade inwards,"
since the only purpose was to prevent supply
reaching the Russian Army from the sea.<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What Places can be Blockaded.</p></div>

<p>§ 372. In former times it was sometimes asserted
that only ports, or even only fortified<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> ports, could be
blockaded, but the practice of the States has always
shown that single ports and portions of an enemy coast as
well as the whole of the enemy coast may be blockaded.
Thus during the American Civil War the whole of the
coast of the Confederate States to the extent of about
2500 nautical miles was blockaded. And attention
must be drawn to the fact, that such ports of a belligerent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
as are in the hands of the enemy may be the
object of a blockade. Thus during the Franco-German
War the French blockaded<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> their own ports of Rouen,
Dieppe, and Fécamp, which were occupied by the
Germans. Article 1 of the Declaration of London
indirectly sanctions the practice of the States by enacting
that "a blockade must not extend beyond the ports
and coasts belonging to or occupied by the enemy."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_740_740" id="Footnote_740_740"></a><a href="#FNanchor_740_740"><span class="label">[740]</span></a> Napoleon I. maintained in his Berlin Decrees: "Le droit de

<div class="sidenote"><p>Blockade of International Rivers.</p></div>

<p>§ 373. It is a moot question whether the mouth of
a so-called international river may be the object of a
blockade, in case the riparian States are not all belligerents.
Thus, when in 1854, during the Crimean War,
the allied fleets of Great Britain and France blockaded
the mouth of the Danube, Bavaria and Württemberg,
which remained neutral, protested. When in 1870 the
French blockaded the whole of the German coast of
the North Sea, they exempted the mouth of the river
Ems, because it runs partly through Holland. And
when in 1863, during the blockade of the coast of the
Confederate States, the Federal cruiser <i>Vanderbilt</i>
captured the British vessel <i>Peterhoff</i><a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> destined for
Matamaros, on the Mexican shore of the Rio Grande,
the American Courts released the vessel on the ground
that trade with Mexico, which was neutral, could not
be prohibited.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_742_742" id="Footnote_742_742"></a><a href="#FNanchor_742_742"><span class="label">[742]</span></a> 5 Wallace, 49. See Fauchille, <i>Blocus</i>, pp. 171-183;
Phillimore, III. § 293<span class="smcap">A</span>; Hall, § 266; Rivier, II. p. 291.</p></div>

<p>The Declaration of London would seem to settle the
controversy only as regards one point. By enacting
that "the blockading forces must not bar access to
neutral ports or coasts," article 18 certainly prohibits
the blockade of the whole mouth of a boundary river
between a neutral and a belligerent State, as, for instance,
the River Rio Grande in case of war with the
United States of America, provided Mexico remained
neutral. But no provision is made for the case of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
blockade of the mouths of rivers, such as the Danube
or the Rhine, for example, which pass through several
States between their sources and their mouths at the
sea coast, if one or more upper riparian States remain
neutral.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Justification
of
Blockade.</p></div>

<p>§ 374. The question has been raised in what way
blockade, which vests a belligerent with a certain
jurisdiction over neutral vessels and which has detrimental
consequences for neutral trade, could be justified.<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
Several writers, following Hautefeuille,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> maintain
that the establishment of a blockade by a belligerent
stationing a number of men-of-war so as to block the
approach to the coast includes conquest of that part of
the sea, and that such conquest justifies a belligerent in
prohibiting ingress and egress of vessels of all nations.
In contradistinction to this artificial construction of
a conquest of a part of the sea, some writers<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> try to
justify blockade by the necessity of war. I think,
however, no special justification of blockade is necessary
at all. The fact is that the detrimental consequences
of blockade to neutrals stand in the same category as
the many other detrimental consequences of war to
neutrals. Neither the one nor the other need be
specially justified. A blockade interferes indeed with
the recognised principle of the freedom of the sea, and,
further, with the recognised freedom of neutral commerce.
But all three have developed together, and
when the freedom of the sea in time of peace and war,
and, further, when the freedom of neutral commerce
became generally recognised, the exceptional restrictions
of blockade became at the same time recognised as
legitimate.</p>

<p>§ 375. A declaration of blockade being "a high<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>
act of sovereignty" and having far-reaching consequences
upon neutral trade, it is generally recognised
not to be in the discretion of a commander of a naval
force to establish blockade without the authority of his
Government. Article 9 of the Declaration of London
precisely enacts that "a Declaration of blockade is
made by the blockading Power or by the naval authorities
acting in its name." The authority of his Government
to establish a blockade can be granted to a
commander of a naval force purposely for a particular
blockade, the Government ordering the commander of
a squadron to blockade a certain port or coast. Or
a Government can expressly delegate its power to
blockade to a commander for use at his discretion.
And if operations of war take place at great distance<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
from the seat of Government and a commander finds
it necessary to establish a blockade, the latter can
become valid through his Government giving its
immediate consent after being informed of the act of
the commander. And, further, the powers vested in
the hands of the supreme commander of a fleet are
supposed to include the authority to establish a blockade
in case he finds it necessary, provided that his Government
acquiesces as soon as it is informed of the establishment
of the blockade.<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>§ 376. <a name="A_blockade_is_not376" id="A_blockade_is_not376"></a>A blockade is not in being <i>ipso facto</i> by the
outbreak of war. And even the actual blocking of the
approach to an enemy coast by belligerent men-of-war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
need not by itself mean that the ingress and egress of
<i>neutral</i> vessels are to be prohibited, since it can take
place for the purpose of preventing the egress and
ingress of <i>enemy</i> vessels only. Continental writers,
therefore, have always considered notification to be
essential for the establishment of a blockade. English,
American, and Japanese writers, however, have not
hitherto held notification to be essential, although
they considered knowledge on the part of a neutral
vessel of an existing blockade to be necessary for her
condemnation for breach of blockade.<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a></p>

<p>But although Continental writers have always held
notification to be essential for the establishment of
blockade, they differed with regard to the kind of notification
that is necessary. Some writers<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> maintained that
three different notifications must take place&mdash;namely,
first, a local notification to the authorities of the
blockaded ports or coast; secondly, a diplomatic or
general notification to all maritime neutral States by the
blockading belligerent; and, thirdly, a special notification
to every approaching neutral vessel. Other
writers<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> considered only diplomatic and special
notification essential. Others again<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> maintained that
special notification to every approaching neutral vessel is
alone required, although they recommended diplomatic
notification as a matter of courtesy.</p>

Calvo, V. § 2846; Fauchille, pp. 219-221.</p></div>

<p>As regards the practice of States, it has always been
usual for the commander who established a blockade to
send a notification of the blockade to the authorities
of the blockaded ports or coast and the foreign consuls
there. It has, further, always been usual for the
blockading Government to notify the fact diplomatically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
to all neutral maritime States. And some States, as
France and Italy, have always ordered their blockading
men-of-war to board every approaching neutral vessel
and notify her of the establishment of the blockade.
But Great Britain, the United States of America, and
Japan did not formerly consider notification to be
essential for the institution of a blockade. They
held the simple fact that the approach was blocked,
and egress and ingress of neutral vessels actually prevented,
to be sufficient to make the existence of a
blockade known, and when no diplomatic notification
had taken place, they did not seize a vessel for breach
of blockade whose master had no actual notice of the
existence of the blockade. English,<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> American,<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and
Japanese<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> practice, accordingly, made a distinction

and, on the other, a notified blockade.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London, when ratified, will
create a common practice, for articles 8 to 12 represent
an agreement of the Powers on the following
points:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) There must be a <i>declaration</i> as well as a <i>notification</i>
in order to make a blockade binding (article 8).
If there is either no proper declaration or no proper
notification, the blockade is not binding.</p>

<p>(2) A <i>declaration</i> of blockade is made either by the
blockading Power or by the naval authorities acting
in its name. The declaration of blockade must specify
(<i>a</i>) the date when the blockade begins; (<i>b</i>) the geographical
limits of the coastline under blockade; and
(<i>c</i>) the period within which neutral vessels may come out
(article 9). If the commencement of the blockade or
its geographical limits are given inaccurately in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
declaration, or if no mention is made of the period within
which neutral vessels may come out, or if this period
is given inaccurately, the declaration is void, and a
new declaration is necessary in order to make the
blockade binding (article 10).</p>

<p>(3) <i>Notification</i> of the declaration of blockade must
at once be made. Two notifications are necessary
(article 11):&mdash;</p>

<p>The first notification must be made by the Government
of the blockading fleet to all neutral Governments
either through the diplomatic channel, or otherwise,
for instance by telegraph. The purpose of this notification
is to enable neutral Governments to inform merchantmen
sailing under their flag of the establishment
of a blockade.</p>

<p>The second notification must be made to the local
authorities by the officer commanding the blockading
force; these authorities have on their part to notify, as
soon as possible, the foreign consuls at the blockaded
port or coastline. The purpose of this notification is
to enable neutral merchantmen in the blockaded port
or ports to receive knowledge of the establishment of
the blockade and to prepare themselves to leave the
port within the period specified in the declaration of
blockade.</p>

<p>(4) The rules as to declaration and notification of
blockade apply to cases where the limits of a blockade
have been extended, or where a blockade is re-established
after having been raised (article 12).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Length of Time for Egress of Neutral Vessels.</p></div>

<p>§ 377. As regards <i>ingress</i>, a blockade becomes valid
the moment it is established; even vessels in ballast
have no right of ingress. As regards <i>egress</i>, it has
always been usual for the blockading commander to
grant a certain length of time within which neutral
vessels might leave the blockaded ports unhindered,
but no rule existed respecting the length of such time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
although fifteen days were frequently granted.<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> This
usage of granting to neutral vessels a period within
which they may leave the blockaded port, has been
made a binding rule by the Declaration of London.
For, since article 9 enacts that a declaration of blockade
must specify the period within which neutral vessels
may come out, it implicitly enacts that the granting of
such a period is compulsory, although it may only be
long enough to enable neutral vessels to make their
way out as quickly as possible.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_756_756" id="Footnote_756_756"></a><a href="#FNanchor_756_756"><span class="label">[756]</span></a> According to U.S. Naval War Code, article 43, thirty days

<div class="sidenote"><p>End of
Blockade.</p></div>

<p>§ 378. Apart from the conclusion of peace, a blockade
can come to an end in three different ways.</p>

<p>It may, firstly, be raised, or restricted in its limits,
by the blockading Power for any reason it likes. In
such a case it has always been usual to notify the end
of blockade to all neutral maritime States, and article
13 of the Declaration of London turns this usage into a
binding rule by enacting that the voluntary raising of
a blockade, as also any restrictions in its limits, must,
in the same way as the declaration of a blockade, be
notified to all neutral Governments by the blockading
Power, as well as to the local authorities by the officer
commanding the blockading fleet.</p>

<p>A blockade can, secondly, come to an end through
an enemy force driving off the blockading squadron or
fleet. In such case the blockade ends <i>ipso facto</i> by the
blockading squadron being driven away, whatever
their intention as to returning may be. Should the
squadron return and resume the blockade, it must be
considered as new, and not simply the continuation
of the former blockade, and another declaration and
notification are necessary (article 12 of the Declaration
of London).</p>

<p>The third ground for the ending of a blockade is its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
failure to be effective, a point which will be treated

<p>§ 379. The necessity for effectiveness in a blockade
by means of the presence of a blockading squadron
of sufficient strength to prevent egress and ingress of
vessels became gradually recognised during the first
half of the nineteenth century; it became formally
enacted as a principle of the Law of Nations through
the Declaration of Paris in 1856, and the Declaration of
London enacts it by article 2. Effective blockade is
the contrast to so-called fictitious or paper blockade,
which was frequently practised during the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and at the beginning of the nineteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> Fictitious blockade consists in the declaration
and notification that a port or a coast is blockaded
without, however, posting a sufficient number of men-of-war
on the spot to be really able to prevent egress
and ingress of every vessel. It was one of the principles
of the First and of the Second Armed Neutrality that
a blockade should always be effective, but it was not
till after the Napoleonic wars that this principle
gradually found universal recognition. During the
second half of the nineteenth century even those States
which had not acceded to the Declaration of Paris did
not dissent regarding the necessity for effectiveness of
blockade.</p>

<i>by such a force as is sufficient really to prevent
access to the coast</i>. But no unanimity exists respecting
what is required to constitute an effective blockade
according to this definition. Apart from differences
of opinion regarding points of minor interest, it may
be stated that in the main there are two conflicting
opinions.</p>

<p>According to one opinion, the definition of an
effective blockade pronounced by the First Armed
Neutrality of 1780 is valid, and a blockade is effective
only when the approach to the coast is barred by a
chain of men-of-war anchored on the spot and so
near to one another that the line cannot be passed
without obvious danger to the passing vessel.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> This
corresponds to the practice hitherto followed by
France.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_758_758" id="Footnote_758_758"></a><a href="#FNanchor_758_758"><span class="label">[758]</span></a> See Hautefeuille, II. p. 194; Gessner, p. 179; Kleen, I. §
129; Boeck, Nos. 676-681; Dupuis, Nos. 173-174; Fauchille, <i>Blocus</i>, pp.
110-142. Phillimore, III. § 293, takes up the same standpoint in so far
as a blockade <i>de facto</i> is concerned:&mdash;"A blockade <i>de facto</i> should be
effected by stationing a number of ships, and forming as it were an arch
of circumvallation round the mouth of the prohibited port, where, if the
arch fails in any one part, the blockade itself fails altogether."</p></div>

<p>According to another opinion, a blockade is effective
when the approach is watched&mdash;to use the words of
Dr. Lushington<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>&mdash;"by a force sufficient to render
the egress and ingress dangerous, or, in other words,
save under peculiar circumstances, as fogs, violent
winds, and some necessary absences, sufficient to
render the capture of vessels attempting to go in or
come out most probable." According to this opinion
there need be no chain of anchored men-of-war to
expose any vessels attempting to break the blockade
to a cross fire, but a real danger of capture suffices,
whether the danger is caused by cruising or anchored
men-of-war. This is the standpoint of theory and
practice of Great Britain and the United States, and
it seems likewise to be that of Germany and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
German writers.<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> The blockade during the American
War of the whole coast of the Confederate States to the
extent of 2500 nautical miles by four hundred Federal
cruisers could, of course, only be maintained by cruising
vessels; and the fact that all neutral maritime States
recognised it as effective shows that the opinion of
dissenting writers has more theoretical than practical
importance.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London has settled the controversy
in so far as article 3 enacts that "the question
whether a blockade is effective, is a question of fact."
Each case must, therefore, be judged according to its
merits, and the before mentioned decision of Dr.
Lushington would seem to have found implied recognition
by article 3.</p>

<p>The question of effectiveness being one of fact, and
the real danger to passing vessels being the characteristic
of effectiveness of blockade, it must be recognised that
in certain cases and in the absence of a sufficient number
of men-of-war a blockade may be made effective through
planting land batteries within range of any vessel
attempting to pass,<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> provided there be at least one
man-of-war on the spot. But a stone blockade,<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> so
called because vessels laden with stones are sunk in the
channel to block the approach, is not an effective
blockade.</p>

here also that according to article 2 of Convention VIII. "it is
forbidden to lay automatic contact mines off the ports and coasts of the
enemy, with the sole object of intercepting commercial navigation."</p></div>

<p>And it must, lastly, be mentioned that the distance
of the blockading men-of war from the blockaded
port or coast is immaterial so long as the circumstances
and conditions of the special case justify such distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
Thus during the Crimean War the port of Riga was
blockaded by a man-of-war stationed at a distance of
120 miles from the town, in the Lyser Ort, a channel
three miles wide forming the only approach to the
gulf.<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Amount of Danger which creates Effectiveness.</p></div>

<p>§ 381. It is impossible to state exactly what degree
of danger to a vessel attempting to pass is necessary
to prove an effective blockade. It is recognised that
a blockade does not cease to be effective in case now
and then a vessel succeeds in passing the line unhindered,
provided there was so much danger as to make her
capture probable. Dr. Lushington strikingly dealt
with the matter in the following words:<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>&mdash;"The
maintenance of a blockade must always be a question
of degree&mdash;of the degree of danger attending ships
going into or leaving a port. Nothing is further from
my intention, nor indeed more opposed to my notions,
than any relaxation of the rule that a blockade must
be sufficiently maintained; but it is perfectly obvious
that no force could bar the entrance to absolute certainty;
that vessels may get in and get out during the
night, or fogs, or violent winds, or occasional absence;
that it is most difficult to judge from numbers alone.
Hence, I believe that in every case the inquiry has been,
whether the force was competent and present, and, if
so, the performance of the duty was presumed; and I
think I may safely assert that in no case was a blockade
held to be void when the blockading force was on the
spot or near thereto on the ground of vessels entering
into or escaping from the port, where such ingress or
egress did not take place with the consent of the blockading
squadron."</p>

as attempt to pass the approach. A blockade, therefore,
ceases <i>ipso facto</i> by the absence of such danger,
whether the blockading men-of-war are driven away,
or are sent away for the fulfilment of some task which
has nothing to do with the blockade, or voluntarily
withdraw, or allow the passage of vessels in other cases
than those which are exceptionally admissible. Thus,
when in 1861, during the American Civil War, the
Federal cruiser <i>Niagara</i>, which blockaded Charleston,
was sent away and her place was taken after five days
by the <i>Minnesota</i>, the blockade ceased to be effective,
although the Federal Government refused to recognise
this.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> Thus, further, when during the Crimean War
Great Britain allowed Russian vessels to export goods
from blockaded ports, and accordingly the egress of
such vessels from the blockaded port of Riga was permitted,
the blockade of Riga ceased to be effective,
because it tried to interfere with neutral commerce
only; therefore, the capture of the Danish vessel
<i>Franciska</i><a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> for attempting to break the blockade was

hitherto differed with regard to the question at what

<p>It must be specially observed that the blockade-runner

knowledge on the part of a vessel of the existence of a

<p>It is for this reason that Continental theory and
practice have never considered a blockade established
without local and diplomatic notification, so that every
vessel might have, or might be supposed to have, notice
of the existence of a blockade. And for the same reason
some States, as France and Italy, have never considered
a vessel to have committed a breach of blockade unless
a special warning was given her before her attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>

<p>British, American, and Japanese practice regarding
the necessary knowledge of the existence of a blockade
on the part of a vessel has always made a distinction
between actual and constructive notice, no breach of
blockade having been held to exist without either the
one or the other.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Actual notice has been considered
knowledge acquired by a direct warning from one of
the blockading men-of-war or knowledge acquired
from any other public or private source of information.
Constructive knowledge has been presumed knowledge
of the blockade on the part of a vessel on the ground
either of notoriety or of diplomatic notification. The
existence of a blockade has always been presumed to
be notorious to vessels within the blockaded ports, but
it has been a question of fact whether it was notorious
to other vessels. And knowledge of the existence of a
blockade has always been presumed on the part of a
vessel in case sufficient time had elapsed after the home
State of the vessel had received diplomatic notification
of the blockade, so that it could inform thereof all
vessels sailing under its flag, whether or no they had
actually received, or taken notice of, the information.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>The Declaration of London follows, to a certain
extent, British, American, and Japanese practice, but
differs chiefly in the presumption that knowledge of a
blockade is never absolute, but may in every case be
rebutted. Article 14 enacts that "the liability of a
neutral vessel to capture for breach of blockade is contingent
on her knowledge, actual or presumptive, of the
blockade." Knowledge of the blockade is presumed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
<i>failing proof to the contrary</i>, in case the vessel has left
a neutral port subsequent to the notification of the
blockade to the Power to which such port belongs, and
provided that the notification was made in sufficient
time (article 15). But in case a neutral vessel <i>approaching</i>
a blockaded port has neither actual nor presumptive
knowledge of the blockade, she is not considered <i>in
delicto</i>, and notification must be made to her by recording
a warning on her log-book, stating the day and
hour and the geographical position of the vessel at the
time (article 16, first paragraph). Further, if a neutral
vessel is <i>coming out</i> of a blockaded port, she must be
allowed to pass free, in case, through the negligence of
the officer commanding the blockading fleet, no declaration
of blockade was notified to the local authorities,
or in case, in the declaration as notified, no
period was mentioned within which neutral vessels
might come out (article 16, second paragraph).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The former practice as to what constitutes an Attempt to
break Blockade.</p></div>

<p>§ 385. <a name="The_practice_of385" id="The_practice_of385"></a>The practice of States as well as the opinions
of writers have hitherto differed much regarding such
acts of a vessel as constitute an attempt to break
blockade.</p>

<p>(1) The Second Armed Neutrality of 1800 intended
to restrict an attempt to break blockade to the employment
of force or ruse by a vessel on the line of
blockade for the purpose of passing through. This
was, on the whole, the practice of France, which
moreover, as stated before, required that the vessel
should previous to the attempt have received special
warning from one of the blockading men-of-war. Many
writers<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> took the same standpoint.</p>

<p>(2) The practice of other States, as Japan, approved
by many writers,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> went beyond this and considered it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
an attempt to break blockade when a vessel, with or
without force or ruse, endeavoured to pass the line
of blockade. This practice frequently saw an attempt
complete in the fact that a vessel destined for a blockaded
place was found anchoring or cruising near the line of
blockade.</p>

<p>(3) The practice of Great Britain and the United
States of America went furthest, since it considered it
an attempted breach of blockade when a vessel, not
destined according to her ship papers for a blockaded
port, was found near it and steering for it; and,
further, when a vessel destined for a port, the blockade
of which was diplomatically notified, started on her
journey knowing that the blockade had not been
raised, except when the port from which the vessel
sailed was so distant from the scene of war as to justify
her master in starting for a destination known to be
blockaded, on the chance of finding that the blockade
had been removed, and with an intention of changing
her destination should that not prove to be the case.<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>
This practice, further, applied the doctrine of continuous
voyages<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> to blockade, for it considered an
attempt of breach of blockade to have been committed
by such vessel as, although ostensibly destined for a
neutral or an unblockaded port, is in reality intended,
after touching there, to go on to a blockaded port.<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a></p>

<p>(4) <a name="During_the_Civil_War4of385" id="During_the_Civil_War4of385"></a>During the Civil War the American Prize Courts
carried the practice further by condemning such vessels
for breach of blockade as knowingly carried to a neutral
port cargo ultimately destined for a blockaded port,
and by condemning for breach of blockade such cargo,
but not the vessel, as was ultimately destined for a
blockaded port, when the carrying vessel was ignorant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
of this ulterior destination of the cargo. Thus the
<i>Bermuda</i>,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> a British vessel with a cargo, part of which
was, in the opinion of the American Courts, ultimately
destined for the blockaded ports of the Confederate
States, was seized on her voyage to the neutral British
port of Nassau, in the Bahama Islands, and condemned
for breach of blockade by the American Courts. The
same happened to the British vessel <i>Stephen Hart</i>,<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
which was seized on her voyage to the neutral port of
Cardenas, in Cuba. And in the famous case of the
<i>Springbok</i>,<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> a British vessel also destined for Nassau,
in the Bahama Islands, which was seized on her voyage
to this neutral British port, the cargo alone was finally
condemned for breach of blockade, since, in the opinion
of the Court, the vessel was not cognisant that the
cargo was intended to reach a blockaded port. The
same happened to the cargo of the British vessel
<i>Peterhoff</i><a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> destined for the neutral port of Matamaros,
in Mexico. The British Government declined to intervene
in favour of the British owners of the respective
vessels and cargoes.<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What constitutes an Attempt to break Blockade according to
the Declaration of London.</p></div>

<p>§ 385<i>a</i>. The Declaration of London proposes a
settlement of this controversial matter by enacting in
article 17 that "neutral vessels may not be captured
for breach of blockade except within the area of operations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
of the men-of-war detailed to render the blockade
effective," and in article 19 that "whatever may be
the ulterior destination of a vessel or of her cargo, she
may not be captured for breach of blockade, if, at the
moment, she is on the way to a non-blockaded port."</p>

<p>Accordingly, a neutral vessel, to be guilty of an
attempt to break blockade, must actually have entered
the <i>area of operations</i> (<i>rayon d'action</i>) of the blockading
fleet. This <i>area of operations</i> is a question of fact in
each case of a blockade. "When a Government decides
to undertake blockading operations against some part
of the enemy coast it details a certain number of men-of-war
to take part in the blockade, and entrusts the
command to an officer whose duty it is to use them
for the purpose of making the blockade effective. The
commander of the naval force thus formed posts the
vessels at his disposal according to the line of the coast
and the geographical position of the blockaded places,
and instructs each vessel as to the part which she has
to play, and especially as to the zone which she is to
watch. All the zones watched taken together and so
organised as to make the blockade effective, form the
area of operations of the blockading force."<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_785_785" id="Footnote_785_785"></a><a href="#FNanchor_785_785"><span class="label">[785]</span></a> Report of the Drafting Committee on article 17.</p></div>

<p>But the fact alone that a neutral vessel has entered
the area of operations is not sufficient to justify her
capture, she must also be destined and be on her way to
the blockaded port. If she passes through the area of
operations without being destined and on her way to
the blockaded port, she is not attempting to break the
blockade. Even should the ulterior destination of a
vessel or her cargo be the blockaded port, she is not
considered to attempt to break the blockade, if, at the
moment of the visitation, she is really on her way to a
non-blockaded port (article 19). However, she must
really, and not only apparently, be on her way to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
non-blockaded port; if it can be proved that in reality
her immediate destination is the blockaded port and
that she only feigns to be destined for a non-blockaded
port, she may be captured, for she is actually attempting
to break the blockade.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a></p>

<p>From these stipulations of the Declaration of London
it becomes quite apparent that the application to
blockade of the doctrine of continuous voyage in any
form is not admissible.</p>

<p>According to the practice which has hitherto been

a breach of blockade. On the other hand, according

<p>The Declaration of London recognises that necessity
makes exceptions to the rule that vessels may not enter
a blockaded port. Article 7 enacts that "in circumstances
of distress, acknowledged by an officer of the
blockading force, a neutral vessel may enter a place under
blockade, and subsequently leave it, provided that she
has neither discharged nor shipped any cargo there."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
It has, however, to be kept in view that article 7, firstly,
does not define the term <i>circumstances of distress</i>, and,
secondly, makes it a condition that the circumstances
concerned must be acknowledged by an officer of the
blockading force. Everything is, therefore, <i>prima facie</i>
at any rate, left to the consideration of the respective
officer. A vessel in distress will have to signal to the
man-of-war of the blockading force which she meets
within the area of operations that she intends to enter
the blockaded port, and the commander of the man-of-war
will have to convince himself that circumstances
of distress really exist, and that no fraud is intended.
The commander may deny the condition of distress,
and then the vessel may not proceed, although the
State whose flag she flies may ask for indemnities in
case there really was distress and the vessel was lost
or damaged by not being allowed to enter the blockaded
port. On the other hand, when once the commander
of the man-of-war has acknowledged that the respective
vessel is in a condition of distress, it is not in his discretion,
but he is in duty bound,<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> to allow her to enter
the blockaded port.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London recognises by article 7&mdash;see
above, § <a href="#Although_blockade386">386</a>&mdash;that a vessel which, on account of
distress, entered a blockaded port, must be allowed
to leave it afterwards, provided she has neither discharged
nor shipped cargo there. And article 16,
second paragraph&mdash;see above, § <a href="#Since_breach_of384">384</a>&mdash;enacts that a
vessel coming out of a blockaded port must be allowed
to pass free, if, through the negligence of the commander
of the blockading fleet, no declaration of blockade has
been notified to the local authorities, or if, in the declaration
as notified, no period has been mentioned
within which neutral vessels might come out. But

<div class="sidenote"><p>Capture of
Blockade-running
Vessels.</p></div>

<p>§ 389. It is universally recognised that a vessel
may be captured for a breach of blockade <i>in delicto</i>
only, that means, during the time of an attempt to
break it, or of the breach itself. But here again
practice as well as theory hitherto have differed much,
since there has been no unanimity with regard to the
extent of time during which an attempt of breach and
the breach itself could be said to be actually continuing.</p>

<p>It has already been stated above in § <a href="#The_practice_of385">385</a> that
it has been a moot point from what moment a breach of
blockade could be said to have been attempted, and
that according to the practice of Great Britain and the
United States an attempt was to be found in the fact
that a vessel destined for a blockaded port was starting
on her voyage. It is obvious that the controversy
bore upon the question from what point of time a
blockade-running vessel must be considered <i>in delicto</i>.</p>

<p>But it has been likewise a moot point as to when the
period of time during which a blockade-running vessel
might be said to be <i>in delicto</i> came to an end. According
to Continental theory and practice, such vessel
was considered to be <i>in delicto</i> only so long as she was
actually on the line of blockade, or, having fled from
there, so long as she was pursued by one of the blockading
cruisers. On the other hand, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
practice of Great Britain<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> and the United States,<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> a
blockade-running vessel was held to be <i>in delicto</i> so
long as she <i>had not completed her voyage from the blockaded
port to the port of her destination and back to the port from
which she started originally</i>, the voyage out and home
being considered one voyage. But a vessel was held
to be <i>in delicto</i> so long only as the blockade continued,
capture being no longer admissible in case the blockade
had been raised or had otherwise come to an end.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London, when ratified, will
settle the controversy, for, according to article 20, a
vessel is <i>in delicto</i> so long only as she is pursued by a
man-of-war of the blockading force, and she may no
longer be captured if the pursuit is abandoned or if
the blockade is raised. Stress must be laid on two
points. Firstly, the pursuit must be carried out by a
man-of-war belonging to the blockading force, and not
by any other cruiser. Secondly, a blockade-breaking
vessel is liable to capture so long as the pursuit lasts,
whether or no she is still within the area of operations;
even if for a while she has taken refuge in a neutral
port, she may, on coming out, be captured, provided
the captor is one of the men-of-war of the blockading
force which pursued her and waited for her outside the
port of refuge.<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Penalty
for Breach
of
Blockade.</p></div>

<p>§ 390. Capture being effected, the blockade-runner
must be sent to a port to be brought before a Prize
Court. For this purpose the crew may be temporarily
detained, as they will have to serve as witnesses. In
former times the crew could be imprisoned, and it is
said that even capital<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> punishment could have been
pronounced against them. But since the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
century this practice of imprisoning the crew has been
abandoned, and nowadays the crew may not even be
made prisoners of war, but must be released as soon
as the Prize Court has pronounced its verdict.<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> The
only penalty which may be pronounced is confiscation
of the vessel and the cargo. But the practice<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> of the
several States has hitherto differed much concerning
the penalty for breach of blockade. According to
British and American practice, confiscation of both
vessel and cargo used to take place in case the owners
of the vessel were identical with those of the cargo.
In case vessel and cargo had not the same owners, confiscation
of both took place only when the cargo consisted
of contraband of war or the owners knew of the
blockade at the time the cargo was shipped for the
blockaded port.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> And it mattered not whether the
captured vessel which carried the cargo had herself
actually passed through the blockaded line, or the
breach of blockade was effected through a combined
action of lighters and the vessel, the lighters passing
the line and discharging the cargo into the vessel near
the line, or <i>vice versa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> The cargo alone was confiscated
according to the judgments of the American Prize
Courts during the Civil War in the case of the <i>Springbok</i>
and in similar cases<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> when goods ultimately destined
for a blockaded port were sent to a neutral port on
a vessel whose owners were ignorant of this ulterior
destination of the goods.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London settles the matter by
a very simple rule, for according to article 21 the penalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
for blockade-breaking is condemnation of the vessel in
all cases, and condemnation of the cargo also, unless
the owner proves that at the time of the shipment of
the goods the shipper <i>neither knew nor could have
known</i> of the intention of the vessel to break the
blockade. The case in which the whole or part of
the cargo consists of contraband, is not mentioned by
article 21, but its condemnation is a matter of course.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Definition
of Contraband
of
War.</p></div>

<p>§ 391. <a name="The_term_contraband391" id="The_term_contraband391"></a>The term contraband is derived from the
Italian "contrabbando," which, itself deriving from the
Latin "contra" and "bannum" or "bandum," means
"in defiance of an injunction." Contraband of war<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>
is the designation of such goods as by either belligerent
are forbidden to be carried to the enemy on the ground
that they enable the latter to carry on the war with
greater vigour. But this definition is only a formal
one, as it does not state what kinds of goods belong
to the class of contraband. This point was much
controverted before the Declaration of London.
Throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth
centuries the matter stood as Grotius had explained it.
Although he does not employ the term contraband, he
treats of the matter. He<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> distinguishes three different
kinds of articles. Firstly, those which, as arms for
instance, can only be made use of in war, and which
are, therefore, always contraband. Secondly, those, as
for example articles of luxury, which can never be made
use of in war and which, therefore, are never contraband.
Thirdly, those which, as money, provisions, ships, and
articles of naval equipment, can be made use of in war
as well as in peace, and which are on account of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
ancipitous use contraband or not according to the
circumstances of the case. In spite of Bynkershoek's
decided opposition<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> to this distinction by Grotius, the
practice of most belligerents until the beginning of the
twentieth century has been in conformity with it. A
great many treaties have from the beginning of the
sixteenth century been concluded between many States
for the purpose of fixing what articles belonging to the
class of ancipitous use should, and what should not, be
regarded between the parties as contraband, but these
treaties disagree with one another. And, so far as they
were not bound by a treaty, belligerents formerly
exercised their discretion in every war according to the
special circumstances and conditions in regarding or not
regarding certain articles of ancipitous use as contraband.
The endeavour of the First and the Second Armed
Neutrality of 1780 and 1800 to restrict the number and
kinds of articles that could be regarded as contraband
failed, and the Declaration of Paris of 1856 uses the
term contraband without any attempt to define it.</p>

contraband is a means of sea warfare against the enemy, it chiefly
concerns neutral commerce and is, therefore, more conveniently treated
with neutrality.</p></div>

tantum usum habent, ut arma: sunt quae in bello nullum habent usum, ut
quae voluptati inserviunt: sunt quae et in bello et extra bellum usum
habent, ut pecuniae, commeatus, naves, et quae navibus adsunt.... In
tertio illo genere usus ancipitis, distinguendus erit belli status...."</p></div>

<p>It is by the Declaration of London that the Powers
have, for the first time in history, come to an agreement
concerning what articles are contraband. The distinction
which Grotius made between three classes of
goods, while still recognised, has been merged by the
Declaration of London into the distinction between
articles of absolute contraband, articles of conditional
contraband, and such articles as may under no circumstances
or conditions be considered contraband. This
Declaration, moreover, has put the whole matter of
contraband upon a new basis, since the Powers have by
articles 22 to 44 agreed upon a common code of rules
concerning contraband.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Absolute and conditional Contraband, and free Articles.</p></div>

<p>§ 392. Apart from the distinction between articles
which can be made use of only in war and those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
ancipitous use, two different classes of contraband must
be distinguished.</p>

<p>There are, firstly, articles which by their very
character are destined to be made use of in war. In
this class are to be reckoned not only arms and ammunition,
but also such articles of ancipitous use as military
stores, naval stores, and the like. They are termed
absolute contraband.</p>

<p>There are, secondly, articles which by their very
character are not destined to be made use of in war,
but which under certain circumstances and conditions
can be of the greatest use to a belligerent for the continuation
of the war. To this class belong, for instance,
provisions, coal, gold, and silver. These articles are
termed conditional or relative contraband.</p>

<p>Although hitherto not all the States have made this
distinction, nevertheless they did make a distinction in
so far as they varied the list of articles which they
declared contraband in their different wars; certain
articles, as arms and ammunition, have always been
on the list, whilst other articles were only considered
contraband when the circumstances of a particular
war made it necessary. The majority of writers have
always approved of the distinction between absolute
and conditional contraband, although several insisted
that arms and ammunition only and exclusively could
be recognised as contraband, and that conditional
contraband did not exist.<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> The distinction would
seem to have been important not only regarding the
question whether or no an article was contraband, but
also regarding the consequences of carrying contraband.<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_816_816" id="Footnote_816_816"></a><a href="#FNanchor_816_816"><span class="label">[816]</span></a> See, for instance, Hautefeuille,
II. p. 157, and Kleen, I. § 90.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_817_817" id="Footnote_817_817"></a><a href="#FNanchor_817_817"><span class="label">[817]</span></a> See below, § <a href="#In_former_times_neither405">405</a>, p. 510.</p></div>

<p>The Declaration of London has adopted (articles 22
and 24) the distinction between absolute and conditional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
contraband, but it distinguishes, besides these
two classes of articles, a third class (article 27). To
this class belong all articles which are either not susceptible
of use in war, or the possibility of the use of
which in war is so remote as practically to make them
not susceptible of use in war. These articles are termed
<i>free articles</i>.<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_818_818" id="Footnote_818_818"></a><a href="#FNanchor_818_818"><span class="label">[818]</span></a> But there are a number of other free articles, although
they do not belong to the articles characterised above; see
below, § <a href="#Besides_the_seventeen396a">396<i>a</i></a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Articles absolutely Contraband.</p></div>

<p>§ 393. That absolute contraband cannot and need
not be restricted to arms and ammunition only and
exclusively becomes obvious, if the fact is taken into
consideration that other articles, although of ancipitous
use, can be as valuable and essential to a belligerent
for the continuance of the war as arms and ammunition.
The necessary machinery and material for the manufacture
of arms and ammunition are almost as valuable
as the latter themselves, and warfare on sea can as
little be waged without vessels and articles of naval
equipment as without arms and ammunition. But
formerly no unanimity existed with regard to such
articles of ancipitous use as had to be considered as
absolute contraband, and States, when they went to
war, increased or restricted, according to the circumstances
of the particular war, the list of articles they
considered absolute contraband.</p>

<p>According to the British practice<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> which has hitherto
prevailed&mdash;subject, however, to the prerogative of the
Crown to order alterations of the list during a war&mdash;the
following articles were considered absolute contraband:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">Arms of all kinds, and machinery for manufacturing arms;
ammunition, and materials for ammunition, including lead,
sulphate of potash, muriate of potash (chloride of potassium),
chlorate of potash, and nitrate of soda; gunpowder and its
materials, saltpetre and brimstone, also guncotton; military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
equipments and clothing; military stores; naval stores, such
as masts, spars, rudders, ship timbers, hemp and cordage, sail-cloth,
pitch and tar, copper for sheathing vessels, marine engines
and the component parts thereof (including screw propellers,
paddle-wheels, cylinders, cranks, shafts, boilers, tubes for
boilers, boiler-plates and fire bars), maritime cement and the
materials used for its manufacture (as blue lias and Portland
cement), iron in any of the following forms: anchors, rivet-iron,
angle-iron, round bars of from 3/4 to 5/8 of an inch diameter, rivets,
strips of iron, sheet plate-iron exceeding 1/4 of an inch, and Low
Moor and Bowling plates.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_819_819" id="Footnote_819_819"></a><a href="#FNanchor_819_819"><span class="label">[819]</span></a> See Holland, <i>Prize Law</i>, § 62.</p></div>

<p>By articles 22 and 23 of the Declaration of London
an agreement has been reached according to which two
classes of absolute contraband must be distinguished.
Article 22 enumerates eleven groups of articles which
may <i>always</i>, without special declaration and notice, be
treated as absolute contraband. These constitute the
first class. The second&mdash;see article 23&mdash;consists of
such articles exclusively used for war as are not
enumerated<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> amongst the eleven groups of the first
class; these may be treated as absolute contraband
also, but only <i>after special declaration and notification</i>.
Such declaration may be published during time of
peace, and notification thereof must then be addressed
to all other Powers; but if the declaration is published
after the outbreak of hostilities, a notification need only
be addressed to the neutral Powers. Should a Power&mdash;see
article 26&mdash;waive, so far as itself is concerned, the
right to treat as absolute contraband an article comprised
in the first class, notification thereof must be
made to the other Powers. The following are the groups
of articles comprised in the first class:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(1) Arms of all kinds, including arms for sporting purposes,

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_820_820" id="Footnote_820_820"></a><a href="#FNanchor_820_820"><span class="label">[820]</span></a> The Report of the Drafting Committee
on article 23 recognises that
at present it would be difficult to
mention any articles which could
under article 23 be declared absolute
contraband, but since future contingencies
cannot be foreseen, it was
considered necessary to stipulate the
possibility of increasing the list of
absolute contraband. That only
such additional articles could be
declared absolute contraband as by
their very character are destined to
be made use of in war, is a matter of
course.</p></div>

<p>It is apparent that this list embodies a compromise,
for it includes several articles&mdash;such as saddle, draught,
and pack animals suitable for use in war&mdash;which Great
Britain and other Powers formerly only considered as
conditional contraband.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Articles
conditionally
Contraband.</p></div>

<p>§ 394. There are many articles which are not by
their character destined to be made use of in war, but
which are nevertheless of great value to belligerents for
the continuance of war. Such articles are conditionally
contraband, which means that they are contraband
when it is clearly apparent&mdash;see below, § <a href="#Whatever_may_be395">395</a>&mdash;that they
are intended to be made use of for military or naval
purposes. This intention becomes apparent on considering
either the destination of the vessel carrying
the articles concerned, or the consignee of the articles.</p>

<p>Before the Declaration of London neither the practice
of States nor the opinion of writers agreed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
the matter, and it was in especial controversial<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a> whether
or no foodstuffs, horses and other beasts of burden, coal
and other fuel, money and the like, and cotton could
conditionally be declared contraband.</p>

<p>(1) That <i>foodstuffs</i> should not under ordinary circumstances
be declared contraband there ought to be
no doubt. There are even several<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> writers who emphatically
deny that foodstuffs could ever be conditional
contraband. But the majority of writers
has always admitted that foodstuffs destined for the
use of the enemy army or navy might be declared
contraband. This has been the practice of Great
Britain,<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a> the United States of America, and Japan.
But in 1885, during her hostilities against China,
France declared rice in general as contraband, on the
ground of the importance of this article to the Chinese
population. And Russia in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese
war, declared rice and provisions in general
as contraband; on the protest of Great Britain and
the United States of America, however, she altered her
decision and declared these articles conditional contraband
only.</p>

<p>(2) The importance of <i>horses and other beasts of
burden</i> for cavalry, artillery, and military transport
explains their frequently being declared as contraband
by belligerents. No argument against their character
as conditional contraband can have any basis. But
they were frequently declared absolute contraband, as,
for instance, by article 36 of the United States Naval
War Code of 1900. Russia, which during the Russo-Japanese
War altered the standpoint taken up at first
by her, and recognised the distinction between absolute
and conditional contraband, nevertheless maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
her declaration of horses and beasts of burden as
absolute contraband. The Declaration of London, by
article 22, No. 7, declares them as absolute contraband.</p>

<p>(3) Since men-of-war are nowadays propelled by
steam power, the importance of <i>coal</i>, and eventually
other fuel for waging war at sea is obvious. For this
reason, Great Britain has ever since 1854 maintained
that coal, if destined for belligerent men-of-war or
belligerent naval ports, is contraband. But in 1859
France and Italy did not take up the same standpoint.
Russia, although in 1885 she declared that she would
never consent to coal being regarded as contraband,
in 1904 declared coal, naphtha, alcohol, and every other
kind of fuel, absolute contraband. And she adhered to
this standpoint, although she was made to recognise
the distinction between absolute and conditional contraband.</p>

<p>(4) As regards <i>money</i>, unwrought precious metals
which may be coined into money, bonds and the
like, the mere fact that a neutral is prohibited by his
duty of impartiality from granting a loan to a belligerent
ought to bring conviction that these articles are contraband
if destined for the enemy State or its forces.
However, the case seldom happens that these articles
are brought by neutral vessels to belligerent ports,
since under the modern conditions of trade belligerents
can be supplied in other ways with the necessary
funds.</p>

<p>(5) As regards <i>raw cotton</i>, it is asserted<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> that in
1861, during the Civil War, the United States declared
it absolute contraband under quite peculiar circumstances,
since it took the place of money sent abroad
for the purpose of paying for vessels, arms, and ammunition.
But this assertion is erroneous.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Be that as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
may, raw cotton should not, under ordinary circumstances,
be able to be considered absolute contraband.
For this reason Great Britain protested when Russia,
in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War, declared
cotton in general as contraband; Russia altered her
standpoint and declared cotton conditional contraband
only.<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

which has hitherto prevailed&mdash;see
Holland, <i>Prize Law</i>, § 64&mdash;the list of
conditional contraband comprises:&mdash;Provisions
and liquors for the consumption
of army and navy; money,
telegraphic materials, such as wire,
porous cups, platina, sulphuric acid,
and zinc; materials for the construction
of a railway, as iron bars,
sleepers, and the like; coal, hay,
horses, rosin, tallow, timber. But it
always was in the prerogative of the
Crown to extend or reduce this list
during a war according to the requirements
of the circumstances.</p></div>

<p>By articles 24 to 28 of the Declaration of London an
agreement has been reached by the Powers according
to which two classes of conditional contraband must be
distinguished. Article 24 enumerates fourteen groups
of articles which may <i>always</i>, without special declaration
and notice, be treated as conditional contraband;
these constitute the first class. The second&mdash;see
article 25&mdash;consists of articles which are not enumerated
either amongst the eleven groups of absolute contraband
contained in article 22 or amongst the fourteen groups
of conditional contraband contained in article 24, but
which are nevertheless susceptible of use in war as well
as for purposes of peace; these may be treated as conditional
contraband also, but <i>only after special declaration
and notification</i>. Such declaration may be published
during time of peace, and notification thereof
must then be addressed to all other Powers; but if
the declaration is published after the outbreak of
hostilities a notification need be addressed to the
neutral Powers only. Should a Power&mdash;see article 26&mdash;waive,
so far as itself is concerned, the right to treat as
conditional contraband an article comprised in the
first class, notification thereof must be made to the
other Powers. But it is of course obvious, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
not specially stated in article 26, that a Power may
treat as conditional contraband any article belonging
either to the first or second class of absolute contraband;
in such a case, however, special declaration and notification
would seem to be necessary. The following are
the groups of articles comprised in the first class of
conditional contraband:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(1) Foodstuffs.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(2) Forage and grain, suitable for feeding animals.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(3) Clothing, fabrics for clothing, and boots and shoes,
suitable for use in war.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(4) Gold and silver in coin or bullion; paper money.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(5) Vehicles of all kinds available for use in war, and their
component parts.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(6) Vessels, craft, and boats of all kinds; floating docks,
parts of docks and their component parts.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(7) Railway material, both fixed and rolling-stock, and
material for telegraphs, wireless telegraphs, and telephones.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(8) Balloons and flying machines and their distinctive component
parts, together with accessories and articles recognisable
as intended for use in connection with balloons and flying
machines.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(9) Fuel; lubricants.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(10) Powder and explosives not specially prepared for use
in war.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(11) Barbed wire and implements for fixing and cutting the
same.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(12) Horseshoes and shoeing materials.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(13) Harness and saddlery.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(14) Field glasses, telescopes, chronometers, and all kinds of
nautical instruments.</p>

<p>This list represents a compromise, just as does the
list of absolute contraband of article 22. Those opponents
of the Declaration of London who object to
foodstuffs being on the list of conditional contraband
forget that several times in the past&mdash;see above, p. <a href="#Page_486">486</a> (1)&mdash;belligerents
have declared foodstuffs absolute contraband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Hostile
Destination
essential
to Contraband.</p></div>

<p>§ 395. <a name="Whatever_may_be395" id="Whatever_may_be395"></a>Whatever may be the nature of articles, they
are never contraband unless they are destined for the
use of a belligerent in war. Arms and ammunition
destined for a neutral are as little contraband as other
goods with the same destination. As this hostile
destination is essential even for articles which are
obviously used in war, such hostile destination is all the
more important for such articles of ancipitous use as
are only conditionally contraband. Thus, for instance,
provisions and coal are perfectly innocent and not at all
contraband if they are not purposely destined for
enemy troops and naval forces, but are destined for
use by a neutral. However, the destination of the
articles must not be confounded with the destination of
the vessel which carries them. For, on the one hand,
certain articles with a hostile destination are considered
contraband although the carrying vessel is destined for
a neutral port, and, on the other hand, certain articles,
although they are without a hostile destination, are
considered contraband because the carrying vessel is
to touch at an intermediate enemy port and is, therefore,
destined for such port, although her ultimate
destination is a neutral port.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London, by articles 30 to 36,
enacts very detailed rules with regard to hostile destination,
distinguishing clearly between the characteristics
of hostile destination of absolute contraband and those
of hostile destination of conditional contraband.</p>

<p>(1) The destination of articles of <i>absolute</i> contraband
is, according to article 30, to be considered hostile if it
be shown that they are being sent either to enemy
territory, or to territory occupied by the enemy, or,
further, to the armed forces of the enemy. And,
according to article 31, hostile destination of absolute
contraband is considered to be completely proved,
firstly, when the goods are consigned to an enemy port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
or to the armed forces of the enemy, and, secondly,
when the vessel is to call either at enemy ports only,
or when she is to touch at an enemy port or meet the
armed forces of the enemy before reaching the neutral
port to which the cargo concerned is consigned.</p>

<p>(2) The destination of articles of <i>conditional</i> contraband,
on the other hand, is, according to article 33,
considered to be hostile if they are intended for the use
of the armed forces or of a government department of
the enemy State, unless in this latter case the circumstances
show that the articles concerned cannot in fact
be used for warlike purposes. Gold and silver in coin
or bullion and paper money, however, are in every case
considered to have a hostile destination if intended for
a government department of the enemy State. And,
according to article 34, hostile destination of articles of
conditional contraband is, if the contrary be not proved,
presumed when the articles are consigned, firstly, to
enemy authorities or to an enemy contractor<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> established
in the enemy country, who as a matter of common
knowledge supplies articles of this kind to the enemy, or,
secondly, to a fortified place of the enemy or to another
place serving as a base<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a>&mdash;whether of operations or
supply&mdash;for the armed forces of the enemy. On the
other hand, if the articles are not so consigned and if
the contrary be not proved, their destination is presumed
to be non-hostile. And in the case of a merchantman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
which can herself be conditional contraband if bound
to a fortified place of the enemy or to another place
serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy, there
is no presumption of a hostile destination, but a direct
proof is necessary that she is destined for the use of the
armed forces or of a government department of the
enemy State.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_827_827" id="Footnote_827_827"></a><a href="#FNanchor_827_827"><span class="label">[827]</span></a> The French text of article 34
contains the words <i>à un commerçant
établi en pays ennemi et lorsqu'il est
notoire que ce commerçant fournit à
l'ennemi des objets et materiaux de cette
nature</i>. The translation <i>to an enemy
contractor</i> has been objected to by
opponents of the Declaration of
London, but it is absolutely correct
because it meets the meaning of the
French text.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_828_828" id="Footnote_828_828"></a><a href="#FNanchor_828_828"><span class="label">[828]</span></a> The Report of the Drafting Committee
on article 34 states that the
base concerned may be one of operations
or supply. Opponents of the
Declaration of London object to
article 34 on account of the alleged
ambiguity of the words <i>place serving
as a base for the armed forces of the
enemy</i>, and assert that all seaports of
Great Britain might be treated as
bases of supply for the armed forces
because railways connect them with
other places which actually serve as
bases of supply or operations. This
is surely erroneous, because the
doctrine of continuous voyages is not&mdash;see
article 35 in contradistinction
to article 30, and below, § <a href="#The_Declaration_of403a">403<i>a</i></a>&mdash;to
be applied to conditional contraband.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Free
Articles.</p></div>

<p>§ 396. It is obvious that such articles as are not
susceptible of use in war may never be declared
contraband, whether their destination be hostile
or not.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London, by article 27, expressly
recognises this and, in article 28&mdash;the so-called <i>free list</i>&mdash;enumerates
seventeen groups of articles which may
never be declared contraband in spite of their hostile
destination, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(1) Raw cotton, wool, silk, jute, flax, hemp, and other raw
materials of the textile industries, and yarns of the same.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(2) Oil seeds and nuts; copra.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(3) Rubber, resins, gums, and lacs; hops.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(4) Raw hides and horns, bones, and ivory.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(5) Natural and artificial manures, including nitrates and
phosphates for agricultural purposes.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(6) Metallic ores.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(7) Earths, clays, lime, chalk, stone, including marble,
bricks, slates, and tiles.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(8) Chinaware and glass.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(9) Paper and paper-making materials.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(10) Soap, paint and colours, including articles exclusively
used in their manufacture, and varnish.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(11) Bleaching powder, soda, ash, caustic soda, salt cake,
ammonia, sulphate of ammonia, and sulphate of copper.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(12) Agricultural, mining, textile, and printing machinery.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(13) Precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, mother-of-pearl,
and coral.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(14) Clocks and watches, other than chronometers.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(15) Fashion and fancy goods.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(16) Feathers of all kinds, hairs, and bristles.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(17) Articles of household furniture and decoration, office
furniture and requisites.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span></p>

<p>This free list is of great importance to neutral trade,
more particularly as it not only comprises such articles
as are not susceptible of use in war, but likewise a
number of articles, the possibility of the use of which
in war is so remote as practically to make them not
susceptible of use in war. The list guarantees to a
number of industries and trades of neutral States
freedom from interference on the part of belligerents,
and it is to be expected that in time the list will be
increased.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Articles
destined
for the use

Vessel, or
to aid the
Wounded.</p></div>

<p>§ 396<i>a</i>. <a name="Besides_the_seventeen396a" id="Besides_the_seventeen396a"></a>Besides the seventeen groups of articles contained
in the free list, there are two other groups of
free articles.</p>

<p>Firstly, those articles which serve exclusively to
aid the sick and wounded. They, according to article
29, No. 1, of the Declaration of London, may never be
treated as contraband even if their destination is hostile.
They may, however, in case of urgent military necessity
and, subject to the payment of compensation, be requisitioned
if they are destined to territory belonging
to or occupied by the enemy or to the armed forces of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Secondly, articles intended for the use of the vessel
in which they are found or for the use of her crew and
passengers during the voyage. Hostile destination
being essential before any kinds of articles may be
considered contraband, those articles which are carried
by a vessel evidently for her own use or for the use of
her crew and passengers can never be contraband, as is
now specially stipulated by article 29, No. 2, of the
Declaration of London. Merchantmen frequently carry
a gun and a certain amount of ammunition for the
purpose of signalling, and, if they navigate in parts of
the sea where there is danger of piracy, they frequently
carry a certain amount of arms and ammunition for
defence against an attack by pirates. It will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
be difficult either for the searching belligerent man-of-war
or for the Prize Court to ascertain whether or no
such arms and ammunition are carried <i>bona fide</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Contraband
Vessels.</p></div>

<p>§ 397. <a name="A_neutral_vessel397" id="A_neutral_vessel397"></a>A neutral vessel, whether carrying contraband
or not, can herself be contraband. Such is the case
when she has been built or fitted out for use in war and
is on her way to the enemy. Although it is the duty of
neutrals&mdash;see article 8 of Convention XIII., and above
§§ <a href="#Whereas_a_neutral334">334</a> and <a href="#In_contradistinction350">350</a>&mdash;to employ the means at their disposal
to prevent the fitting out, arming, or the departure of
any vessel within their jurisdiction, which they have
reason to believe is intended to cruise or to engage in
hostile operations against a belligerent, their duty of
impartiality does not compel them to prevent their
subjects from supplying a belligerent with vessels fit
for use in war except where the vessel concerned has
been built or fitted out by order of a belligerent. Subjects
of neutrals may therefore&mdash;unless prevented from
so doing by Municipal Law, as, for instance, subjects
of the British Crown by §§ 8 and 9 of the Foreign Enlistment
Act, 1870&mdash;by way of trade supply belligerents
with vessels of any kind, provided these vessels have not
been built or fitted out by order of the belligerent concerned.
According to the practice which has hitherto
prevailed, such vessels, being equivalent to arms, used
to be considered as absolute contraband.<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> And it
made no difference whether or no they were fit for use
as men-of-war, it sufficed that they were fit to be used
for the transport of troops and the like.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_829_829" id="Footnote_829_829"></a><a href="#FNanchor_829_829"><span class="label">[829]</span></a> The <i>Richmond</i> (1804), 5 C. Rob. 325. See also Twiss, II. § 148, and
Holland, <i>Prize Law</i>, § 86.</p></div>

<p>According to article 22, No. 10, article 24, No. 6,
and article 34 of the Declaration of London the law
concerning contraband vessels will be the following:&mdash;A
distinction is made between warships on the one
hand, and, on the other, vessels and the like generally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
According to article 22, No. 10, warships, including
their boats and their distinctive component parts of
such a nature that they can only be used on a vessel of
war, may be treated as absolute contraband without
notice. On the other hand, according to article 24,
No. 6, vessels, craft, and boats of all kinds, and, further,
floating docks, parts of docks and their component
parts may only be treated as conditional contraband,
but may be so treated without notice. And it must
be specially observed that whereas with regard to
articles of conditional contraband generally, there is a
legal presumption established as to their hostile destination
in case they are consigned to enemy authorities
or to a contractor established in the enemy
country, who, as a matter of common knowledge,
supplies articles of this kind to the enemy, article 34
expressly exempts merchant vessels from this presumption

<p>§ 398. <a name="The_guaranteed_freedom398" id="The_guaranteed_freedom398"></a>The guaranteed freedom of commerce making
the sale of articles of all kinds to belligerents by subjects
of neutrals legitimate, articles of conditional as well as
absolute contraband may be supplied by sale to either
belligerent by these individuals. And the carriage of
such articles by neutral merchantmen on the Open Sea
is, as far as International Law is concerned, quite as
legitimate as their sale. The carrier of contraband by
no means violates an injunction of the Law of Nations.
But belligerents have by the Law of Nations the right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
prohibit and punish the carriage of contraband by neutral
merchantmen, and the carrier of contraband
violates, for this reason, an injunction of the belligerent
concerned. It is not International Law, but the
Municipal Law of the belligerents, which makes carriage
of contraband illegitimate and penal.<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> The question
why the carriage of contraband articles may nevertheless
be prohibited and punished by the belligerents,
although it is quite legitimate so far as International
Law is concerned, can only be answered by a reference
to the historical development of the Law of Nations.
In contradistinction to former practice, which interdicted
all trade between neutrals and the enemy, the
principle of freedom of commerce between subjects
of neutrals and either belligerent has gradually become
universally recognised; but this recognition included
from the beginning the right of either belligerent to
punish carriage of contraband on the sea. And the
reason obviously is the necessity for belligerents in the
interest of self-preservation to prevent the import of
such articles as may strengthen the enemy, and to
confiscate the contraband cargo, and eventually the
vessel also, as a deterrent to other vessels.</p>

<p>The present condition of the matter of carriage
of contraband<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> is therefore a compromise. In the
interest of the generally recognised principle of freedom
of commerce between belligerents and subjects of
neutrals, International Law does not require neutrals
to prevent their subjects from carrying contraband;
on the other hand, International Law empowers either
belligerent to prohibit and punish carriage of contraband
just as it&mdash;see above, § <a href="#Breach_or_violation383">383</a>&mdash;empowers either
belligerent to prohibit and punish breach of blockade.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London has in no way altered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
the existing condition of the matter. The fact that
articles 22 and 24 give a list of articles which, without
special declaration and notice, may always be treated
as absolute and conditional contraband respectively,
does not involve the forbidding by International Law
of the carriage of the articles. Articles 22 and 24 are
certainly part of International Law, yet they merely
embody an agreement as to what goods may&mdash;but they
need not&mdash;be treated as contraband.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Direct
Carriage
of Contraband.</p></div>

<p>§ 399. Carriage of contraband commonly occurs
where a vessel is engaged in carrying to an enemy
port such goods as are contraband when they have
a hostile destination. In such cases it makes no
difference whether the fact that the vessel is destined
for an enemy port becomes apparent from her papers,
she being bound to such port, or whether she is found at
sea sailing on a course for an enemy port, although her
papers show her to be bound to a neutral port. And,
further, it makes no difference, according to the hitherto
prevailing practice of Great Britain and the United
States of America at any rate, that she is bound to
a neutral port and that the articles concerned are,
according to her papers, destined for a neutral port,
if only she is to call at an intermediate enemy port or
is to meet enemy naval forces at sea in the course of
her voyage to the neutral port of destination;<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> for
otherwise the door would be open to deceit, and it
would always be pretended that goods which a vessel
is engaged in carrying to such intermediate enemy
places were intended for the neutral port of ultimate
destination. For the same reason a vessel carrying
such articles as are contraband when they have a
hostile destination is considered to be carrying contraband
if her papers show that her destination is dependent
upon contingencies under which she may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
to call at an enemy port, unless she proves that she
has abandoned the intention of eventually calling
there.<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<p>The Declaration of London distinguishes between
carriage of absolute and conditional contraband:&mdash;</p>

<p>As regards <i>absolute</i> contraband, a vessel is, according
to article 32, considered to be carrying contraband
whether the fact that she is destined for an enemy port
becomes evident from her papers, she being bound for
such port, or whether she is found at sea sailing for an
enemy port, although her papers show her to be bound for
a neutral port. And, according to article 31, No. 2, it
makes no difference that the vessel is bound for a neutral
port and that the articles concerned are, according to
her papers, destined for a neutral port, if only she is to
touch at an intermediate enemy port or is to meet armed
forces of the enemy before reaching the neutral port
for which the goods in question are consigned.</p>

<p>As regards <i>conditional</i> contraband, a vessel is, according
to article 35, considered to be carrying contraband
whether her papers show her to be destined to an enemy
port, or, being clearly found out of the course to a
neutral port indicated by her papers, she is unable to
give adequate reasons to justify such deviation.</p>

<p>Article 32 as well as article 35 stipulates that ship
papers are conclusive proof as to the destination of the
vessel and of the cargo, unless the vessel is clearly found
out of the course indicated by her papers, but the
Report of the Drafting Committee of the Naval Conference
of London emphasises the fact that the rule of
the conclusiveness of ship papers must not be interpreted
too literally, since otherwise fraud would be
made easy. Ship papers are conclusive proof&mdash;says
the Report&mdash;<i>unless facts show their evidence to be false</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Circuitous
Carriage
of Contraband.</p></div>

<p>§ 400. On occasions a neutral vessel carrying such
articles as are contraband if they have a hostile destination
is, according to her papers, ostensibly bound
for a neutral port, but is intended, after having called
and eventually having delivered her cargo there, to
carry the same cargo from there to an enemy port.
There is, of course, no doubt that such vessels are
carrying contraband whilst engaged in carrying the
articles concerned from the neutral to the enemy port.
But during the American Civil War the question arose
whether they may already be considered to be carrying
contraband when on their way from the port of starting
to the neutral port from which they are afterwards to
carry the cargo to an enemy port, since they are really
intended to carry the cargo from the port of starting
to an enemy port, although not directly, but circuitously,
by a roundabout way. The American Prize Courts
answered the question in the affirmative by applying
to the carriage of contraband the principle of <i>dolus non
purgatur circuitu</i> and the so-called doctrine of continuous
voyages.<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> This attitude of the American Prize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
Courts has called forth protests from many authorities,<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a>
British as well as foreign, but Great Britain has not
protested, and from the attitude of the British Government
in the case of the <i>Bundesrath</i> and other vessels in
1900 during the South African War it could safely,
although indirectly only, be concluded that Great
Britain considered the practice of the American Prize
Courts correct and just, and that, when a belligerent,
she intended to apply the same principles. This could
also be inferred from § 71 of Holland's <i>Manual of Naval
Prize Law</i>, which established the rule: "The ostensible
destination of a vessel is sometimes a neutral port,
while she is in reality intended, after touching, and
even landing and colourably delivering over her cargo
there, to proceed with the same cargo to an enemy port.
In such a case the voyage is held to be 'continuous,'
and the destination is held to be hostile throughout."
And provided that the intention of the vessel is really
to carry the cargo circuitously, by a roundabout way,
to an enemy port, and further provided, that a mere
suspicion is not held for a proof of such intention, I
cannot see why this application of the doctrine of continuous
voyages should not be considered reasonable,
just, and adequate.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_834_834" id="Footnote_834_834"></a><a href="#FNanchor_834_834"><span class="label">[834]</span></a> The so-called doctrine of continuous voyages dates from the
time of the Anglo-French wars at the end of the eighteenth century, and
is connected with the application of the so-called rule of 1756. (See
above, § <a href="#Whereas_on_the_whole289">289</a>.) Neutral vessels engaged in French and Spanish colonial
trade, thrown open to them during the war, sought to evade seizure by
British cruisers and condemnation by British Prize Courts, according to
the rule of 1756, by taking their cargo to a neutral port, landing it
and paying import duties there, and then re-lading it and carrying it to
the mother country of the respective colony. Thus in the case of the
<i>William</i> (1806), 5 C. Rob. 385, it was proved that this neutral vessel
took a cargo from the Spanish port La Guira to the port of Marblehead in
Massachusetts&mdash;the United States being neutral&mdash;landed the cargo, paid
import duties there, then took in the chief part of this cargo besides
other goods, and sailed after a week for the Spanish port of Bilbao. In
all such cases the British Prize Courts considered the voyages from the
colonial port to the neutral port and from there to the enemy port as
one continuous voyage and confirmed the seizure of the ships concerned.
See Remy, <i>Théorie de la continuauté du voyage en matière de blocus et
de contrebande</i> (1902); Hansemann, <i>Die Lehre von der einheitlichen
Reise im Rechte der Blockade und Kriegskonterbande</i> (1910), and
Fauchille in <i>R.G.</i> IV. (1897), pp. 297-323. The American Courts have
applied the doctrine of continuous voyages not only to carriage of
contraband but also to blockade; see above, <a href="#During_the_Civil_War4of385">§ 385 (4)</a>, where the cases
of the <i>Bermuda</i> and the <i>Stephen Hart</i> are quoted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_835_835" id="Footnote_835_835"></a><a href="#FNanchor_835_835"><span class="label">[835]</span></a> See, for instance, Hall, § 247. But Phillimore, III. § 227,
p. 391, says of the judgments of the Supreme Court of the United States
in the cases of the <i>Bermuda</i> and the <i>Peterhoff</i>, that they "contain
very valuable and sound expositions of the law, professedly, and for the
most part really, in harmony with the earlier decisions of English Prize
Courts." On the other hand, Phillimore, III. § 298, p. 490, disagrees
with the American Courts regarding the application of the doctrine of
continuous voyages to breach of blockade, and reprobates the decision in
the case of the <i>Springbok</i>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Indirect Carriage of Contraband (Doctrine of Continuous
Transports).</p></div>

<p>§ 401. It also happens in war that neutral vessels
carry to neutral ports such articles as are contraband
if bound for a hostile destination, the vessel being
cognisant or not of the fact that arrangements have
been made for the articles to be afterwards brought
by land or sea into the hands of the enemy. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
the question has arisen whether such vessels on their
voyage to the neutral port may be considered to be
carrying contraband of war.<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> As early as 1855, during
the Crimean War, the French Conseil-Général des Prises,
in condemning the cargo of saltpetre of the Hanoverian
neutral vessel <i>Vrow Houwina</i>, answered the question
in the affirmative;<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> but it was not until the American
Civil War that the question was decided on principle.
Since from the British port of Nassau, in the Bahamas,
and from other neutral ports near the coast of the Confederate
States, goods, first brought to these nearer
neutral ports by vessels coming from more distant
neutral ports were carried to the blockaded coast of
the Southern States, Federal cruisers seized several
vessels destined and actually on their voyage to Nassau
and other neutral ports because all or parts of their
cargoes were ultimately destined for the enemy. And
the American Courts considered those vessels to be carrying
contraband, although they were sailing from one
neutral port to another, on clear proof that the goods
concerned were destined to be transported by land or
sea from the neutral port of landing into the enemy
territory. The leading cases are those of the <i>Springbok</i>
and <i>Peterhoff</i>, which have been mentioned above in
<a href="#During_the_Civil_War4of385">§ 385 (4)</a>, for the Courts found the seizure of these and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
other vessels justified on the ground of carriage of
contraband as well as on the ground of breach of
blockade. Thus, another application of the doctrine
of continuous voyages came into existence, since vessels
whilst sailing between two neutral ports could only be
considered to be carrying contraband when the transport
first from one neutral port to another and afterwards
from the latter to the enemy territory had been regarded
as one continuous voyage. This application of the
doctrine of continuous voyages is fitly termed "doctrine
of continuous transports."</p>

the <i>Bundesrath</i>, in two able articles in <i>The Law Quarterly Review</i>,
XVII. (1901), under the titles "The Seizure of the <i>Bundesrath</i>" (Mr. I.
Dundas White) and "Contraband Goods and Neutral Ports" (Mr. E. L. de
Hart). See also Baty, <i>International Law in South Africa</i> (1900), pp.
1-44.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_837_837" id="Footnote_837_837"></a><a href="#FNanchor_837_837"><span class="label">[837]</span></a> See Calvo, V. § 2767, p. 52. The case of the Swedish
neutral vessel <i>Commercen</i>, which occurred in 1814, and which is
frequently quoted with that of the <i>Vrow Houwina</i> (1 Wheaton, 382), is
not a case of indirect carriage of contraband. The <i>Commercen</i> was on
her way to Bilbao, in Spain, carrying a cargo of provisions for the
English army in Spain, and she was captured by a privateer commissioned
by the United States of America, which was then at war with England.
When the case, in 1816, came before Mr. Justice Story, he reprobated the
argument that the seizure was not justified because a vessel could not
be considered to be carrying contraband when on her way to a neutral
port, and he asserted that the hostile destination of goods was
sufficient to justify the seizure of the vessel.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>The Case of the <i>Bundesrath</i>.</p></div>

<p>§ 402. This application of the doctrine of continuous
voyages under the new form of continuous transports
has likewise been condemned by many British and
foreign authorities; but Great Britain did not protest
in this case either&mdash;on the contrary, as was mentioned
above in <a href="#During_the_Civil_War4of385">§ 385 (4)</a>, she declined to interfere in favour of
the British owners of the vessels and cargoes concerned.
And that she really considered the practice of the
American Courts just and sound became clearly apparent
by her attitude during the South African War. When,
in 1900, the <i>Bundesrath</i>, <i>Herzog</i>, and <i>General</i>, German
vessels sailing from German neutral ports to the Portuguese
neutral port of Lorenzo Marques in Delagoa Bay,
were seized by British cruisers under the suspicion
of carrying contraband, Germany demanded their
release, maintaining that no carriage of contraband
could be said to take place by vessels sailing from one
neutral port to another. But Great Britain refused
to admit this principle, maintaining that articles
ultimately destined for the enemy were contraband,
although the vessels carrying them were bound for a
neutral port.<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a></p>

Correspondence respecting the action of H.M.'s naval authorities with
regard to certain foreign vessels.</p></div>

<p>There is no doubt that this attitude of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
Government was contrary to the opinion of the prominent
English<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> writers on International Law. Even
the <i>Manual of Naval Prize Law</i>, edited by Professor
Holland<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> in 1888, and "issued by authority of the
Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty," reprobated
the American practice, for in § 72 it lays down the
following rule: "... If the destination of the vessel
be neutral, then the destination of the goods on board
should be considered neutral, notwithstanding it may
appear from the papers or otherwise that the goods
themselves have an ulterior destination by transhipment,
overland conveyance, or otherwise." And the
practice of British Prize Courts in the past would seem
to have been in accordance with this rule. In 1798,
during war between England and the Netherlands, the
neutral ship <i>Imina</i>,<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> which had left the neutral port of
Dantzig for Amsterdam carrying ship's timber, but on
hearing of the blockade of Amsterdam by the British
had changed her course for the neutral port of Emden,
was seized on her voyage to Emden by a British cruiser;
she was, however, released by Sir William Scott because
she had no intention of breaking blockade, and because
a vessel could only be considered as carrying contraband
whilst on a voyage to an enemy port. "The rule
respecting contraband, as I have always understood
it, is that the articles must be taken <i>in delicto</i>, in the
actual prosecution of the voyage to an enemy port,"
said Sir William Scott.<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a></p>

Westlake shows that this is not the case. See Westlake's Introduction in

<div class="sidenote"><p>Continental
support
to the
Doctrine
of Continuous
Transports.</p></div>

<p>§ 403. Although the majority of Continental writers
condemn the doctrine of continuous transports, several
eminent Continental authorities support it. Thus,
Gessner (p. 119) emphatically asserts that the destination
of the carrying vessel is of no importance compared
with the destination of the carried goods themselves.
Bluntschli, although he condemns in § 835 the American
practice regarding breach of blockade committed by a
vessel sailing from one neutral port to another, expressly
approves in § 813 of the American practice
regarding carriage of contraband by a vessel sailing
between two neutral ports, yet carrying goods with a
hostile destination. Kleen (I. § 95, p. 388) condemns
the rule that the neutral destination of the vessel makes
the goods appear likewise neutral, and defends seizure
in the case of a hostile destination of the goods on a
vessel sailing between two neutral ports; he expressly
states that such goods are contraband from
the moment the carrying vessel leaves the port of
loading. Fiore (III. No. 1649) reprobates the theory
of continuous voyages as applied by British and
American Courts, but he asserts nevertheless that the
hostile destination of certain goods carried by a vessel
sailing to a neutral port justifies the vessel being regarded
as carrying contraband, and the seizure thereof. Bonfils
(No. 1569) takes up the same standpoint as Bluntschli,
admitting the application of the theory of continuous
voyages to carriage of contraband, but reprobating its
application to breach of blockade. And the Institute
of International Law adopted the rule:<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> "<i>La destination
pour l'ennemi est présumée lorsque le transport va
à l'un de ses ports, ou bien à un port neutre qui, d'après</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
<i>des preuves évidentes et de fait incontestable, n'est qu'une
étape pour l'ennemi, comme but final de la même opération
commerciale.</i>" Thus this representative body of authorities
of all nations has fully adopted the American
application of the doctrine of continuous voyages to
contraband, and thereby recognised the possibility of
circuitous as well as indirect carriage of contraband.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_843_843" id="Footnote_843_843"></a><a href="#FNanchor_843_843"><span class="label">[843]</span></a> See § 1 of the <i>Règlementation
internationale de la contrebande de
guerre</i>, <i>Annuaire</i>, XV. (1896), p. 230.</p></div>

<p>And it must be mentioned that the attitude of
several Continental States has hitherto been in favour of
the American practice. Thus, according to §§ 4 and 6
of the Prussian Regulations of 1864 regarding Naval
Prizes, it was the hostile destination of the goods or the
destination of the vessel to an enemy port which made
a vessel appear as carrying contraband and which
justified her seizure. In Sweden the same was valid.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>
Thus, further, an Italian Prize Court during the war with
Abyssinia in 1896 justified the seizure in the Red Sea
of the Dutch vessel <i>Doelwijk</i>,<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> which sailed for the
neutral French port of Djibouti, carrying a cargo of
arms and ammunition destined for the Abyssinian
army and to be transported to Abyssinia after having
been landed at Djibouti.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Partial Recognition by the Declaration of London of the
Doctrine of Continuous Voyages.</p></div>

<p>§ 403<i>a</i>. <a name="The_Declaration_of403a" id="The_Declaration_of403a"></a>The Declaration of London offers a compromise
in order to settle the controversy respecting the application
of the doctrine of continuous voyages to the
carriage of contraband, whether circuitous or indirect
carriage be concerned.</p>

<p>(1) On the one hand, article 30 recognises with regard
to <i>absolute</i> contraband the application of the doctrine
of continuous voyages&mdash;both to circuitous and indirect
carriage of contraband&mdash;by enacting that: "absolute
contraband is liable to capture if it is shown to be
destined to territory belonging to or occupied by the
enemy or to the armed forces of the enemy. <i>It is</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
<i>immaterial whether the carriage of the goods is direct or
entails transhipment or a subsequent transport by land.</i>"</p>

<p>(2) On the other hand, article 35 categorically
rejects the doctrine of continuous voyages with regard to
<i>conditional</i> contraband by enacting that "conditional
contraband is not liable to capture except when found
on board a vessel bound for territory belonging to or
occupied by the enemy, or for the armed forces of the
enemy,<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> and when it is not to be discharged in an intervening
neutral port."</p>

<p>(3) However, in cases where the enemy country has
no seaboard, article 36&mdash;in contradistinction to the
provisions of article 35&mdash;expressly recognises the doctrine
of continuous voyages for <i>conditional</i> contraband also
by enacting that "notwithstanding the provisions of
article 35, conditional contraband, if shown to have the
destination referred to in article 33, is liable to capture
in cases where the enemy country has no seaboard."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_846_846" id="Footnote_846_846"></a><a href="#FNanchor_846_846"><span class="label">[846]</span></a> The rule of article 35 came into question for the first
time during the Turco-Italian war. In January 1912, the <i>Carthage</i>, a
French mail-steamer plying between Marseilles and Tunis, was captured
for carriage of contraband by an Italian torpedo-boat and taken to
Cagliari, because she had an aeroplane destined for Tunis on board. As
the destination of the vessel was neutral, and as, according to article
24, No. 8, of the Declaration of London aeroplanes are conditional
contraband, France protested against the capture of the vessel, Italy
agreed to release her, and the parties arranged to have the question as
to whether the capture of the vessel was justified settled by the
Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Capture for Carriage of Contraband.</p></div>

<p>§ 404. <a name="It_has_always_been404" id="It_has_always_been404"></a>It has always been universally recognised by
theory and practice that a vessel carrying contraband
may be seized by the cruisers of the belligerent concerned.
But seizure is allowed only so long as a vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
is <i>in delicto</i>, which commences when she leaves the port
of starting and ends when she has deposited the contraband
goods, whether with the enemy or otherwise.
The rule is generally recognised, therefore, that a vessel
which has deposited her contraband may not be seized
on her return voyage. British and American practice,
however, has hitherto admitted one exception to this
rule&mdash;namely, in the case in which a vessel has carried
contraband on her outward voyage with simulated and
false papers.<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> But no exception has been admitted by
the practice of other countries. Thus, when in 1879,
during war between Peru and Chili, the German vessel
<i>Luxor</i>, after having carried a cargo of arms and ammunition
from Monte Video to Valparaiso, was seized in the
harbour of Callao, in Peru, and condemned by the
Peruvian Prize Courts for carrying contraband, Germany
interfered and succeeded in getting the vessel
released.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_847_847" id="Footnote_847_847"></a><a href="#FNanchor_847_847"><span class="label">[847]</span></a> The <i>Nancy</i> (1800), 3 C. Rob. 122; the <i>Margaret</i> (1810), 1
Acton, 333. See Holland, <i>Prize Law</i>, § 80. Wheaton, I. § 506, note 2,
condemns this practice; Hall, § 247, p. 696, calls it "undoubtedly
severe"; Halleck, II. p. 220, defends it. See also Calvo, V. §§
2756-2758.</p></div>

<p>It must be specially observed that seizure for carriage
of contraband is only admissible on the Open Sea and
in the maritime territorial belts of the belligerents.
Seizure within the maritime belt of neutrals would be
a violation of neutrality.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London entirely confirms these
old customary rules, but does not recognise the above-mentioned
British exception. Article 37 enacts that
a vessel carrying goods liable to capture as absolute or
conditional contraband may be captured on the high
seas or in the territorial waters of the belligerents
throughout the whole of her voyage even if she is to
touch at a port of call before reaching the hostile destination.
Article 38 enacts that a vessel may not be
captured on the ground that she has carried contraband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
on a previous occasion if such carriage is in point of fact
at an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Penalty for Carriage of Contraband according to the Practice
hitherto prevailing.</p></div>

<p>§ 405. <a name="In_former_times_neither405" id="In_former_times_neither405"></a>In former times neither in theory nor in
practice have similar rules been recognised with regard
to the penalty of carriage of contraband. The penalty
was frequently confiscation not only of the contraband
cargo itself, but also of all other parts of the cargo,
together with the vessel. Only France made an exception,
since according to an <i>ordonnance</i> of 1584 she
did not even confiscate the contraband goods themselves,
but only seized them against payment of their value,
and it was not until 1681 that an <i>ordonnance</i> proclaimed
confiscation of contraband, but with exclusion of the
vessel and the innocent part of the cargo.<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> During the
seventeenth century this distinction between contraband
on the one hand, and, on the other, the innocent goods
and the vessel was clearly recognised by Zouche and
Bynkershoek, and confiscation of the contraband only
became more and more the rule, certain cases excepted.
During the eighteenth century the right to confiscate
contraband was frequently contested, and it is remarkable
as regards the change of attitude of some States
that by article 13 of the Treaty of Friendship and
Commerce<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> concluded in 1785 between Prussia and
the United States of America all confiscation was
abolished. This article provided that the belligerent
should have the right to stop vessels carrying contraband
and to detain them for such length of time as might be
necessary to prevent possible damage by them, but such
detained vessels should be paid compensation for the
arrest imposed upon them. It further provided that
the belligerent could seize all contraband against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
payment of its full value, and that, if the captain of a
vessel stopped for carrying contraband should deliver
up all contraband, the vessel should at once be set free.
I doubt whether any other treaty of the same kind was
entered into by either Prussia or the United States.<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a>
And it is certain that, if any rule regarding penalty
for carriage of contraband was generally recognised
at all, it was the rule that contraband goods could be
confiscated. But there always remained the difficulty
that it was controversial what articles were contraband,
and that the practice of States varied much regarding
the question as to whether the vessel herself and innocent
cargo carried by her could be confiscated. For beyond
the rule that absolute contraband could be confiscated,
there was no unanimity regarding the fate of the vessel
and the innocent part of the cargo. Great Britain and
the United States of America hitherto confiscated the
vessel when the owner of the contraband was also the
owner of the vessel; they also confiscated such part
of the innocent cargo as belonged to the owner of the
contraband goods; they, lastly, confiscated the vessel,
although her owner was not the owner of the contraband,
provided he knew of the fact that his vessel was
carrying contraband, or provided the vessel sailed with
false or simulated papers for the purpose of carrying
contraband.<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> Some States allowed such vessel carrying
contraband as was not herself liable to confiscation to
proceed with her voyage on delivery of her contraband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
goods to the seizing cruiser,<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> but Great Britain<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> and
other States insisted upon the vessel being brought
before a Prize Court in every case.</p>

<p>As regards conditional contraband, those States
which made any distinction at all between absolute
and conditional contraband, as a rule confiscated
neither the conditional contraband nor the carrying
vessel, but seized the former and paid for it. According
to British practice<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> hitherto prevailing, freight
was paid to the vessel, and the usual compensation
for the conditional contraband was the cost price
plus 10 per cent. profit. States acting in this way
asserted a right to confiscate conditional contraband,
but exercised pre-emption in mitigation of such a right.
Those Continental writers who refused to recognise the
existence of conditional contraband, denied, consequently,
that there was a right to confiscate articles
not absolutely contraband, but they maintained that
every belligerent had, according to the so-called right
of angary,<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> a right to stop all such neutral vessels
as carried provisions and other goods with a hostile
destination of which he might have made use and to
seize such goods against payment of their full value.</p>

exercised pre-emption instead of confiscation with regard to such
absolute contraband as was in an unmanufactured condition and was at the
same time the produce of the country exporting it.</p></div>

<p>The Institute of International Law, whose rules
regarding contraband, adopted at its meeting at Venice
in 1896, restrict contraband to arms, ammunition,
articles of military equipment, vessels fitted for naval
operations, and instruments for the immediate fabrication
of ammunition, proposed a compromise regarding
articles of ancipitous use. Although the rules state
that those articles may not be considered contraband,
they nevertheless give the choice to a belligerent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
either exercising pre-emption or seizing and temporarily
retaining such articles against payment of indemnities.<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

internationale de la contrebande de guerre</i> adopted by the Institute of
International Law (<i>Annuaire</i>, XV. [1896] p. 230):&mdash;
</p><p>
§ 1. Sont articles de contrebande de guerre: (1) les armes de toute
nature; (2) les munitions de guerre et les explosifs; (3) le matériel
militaire (objets d'équipement, affûts, uniformes, etc.); (4) les
vaisseaux équipés pour la guerre; (5) les instruments spécialement faits
pour la fabrication immédiate des munitions de guerre; lorsque ces
divers objets sont transportés par mer pour le compte ou à la
destination d'un belligérant.
</p><p>
La destination pour l'ennemi est présumée lorsque le transport va à l'un
de ses ports, ou bien à un port neutre qui, d'après des preuves
évidentes et de fait incontestable, n'est qu'une étape pour l'ennemi,
comme but final de la même opération commerciale.
</p><p>
§ 2. Sous la dénomination de <i>munitions de guerre</i> doivent être compris
les objets qui, pour servir immédiatement à la guerre, n'exigent qu'une
simple réunion ou juxtaposition.
</p><p>
§ 3. Un objet ne saurait être qualifié de contrebande à raison de la
seule intention de l'employer à aider ou favoriser un ennemi, ni par
cela seul qu'il pourrait être, dans un but militaire, utile à un ennemi
ou utilisé par lui, ou qu'il est destiné à son usage.
</p><p>
§ 4. Sont et demeurent abolies les prétendues contrebandes désignées
sous les noms soit de contrebande <i>relative</i>, concernant des articles
(<i>usus ancipitis</i>) susceptibles d'être utilisés par un belligérant dans
un but militaire, mais dont l'usage est essentiellement pacifique, soit
de contrebande <i>accidentelle</i>, quand lesdits articles ne servent
spécialement aux buts militaires que dans une circonstance particulière.
</p><p>
§ 5. Néanmoins le belligérant a, à son choix et à charge d'une équitable
indemnité, le droit de séquestre ou de préemption quant aux objets qui,
en chemin vers un port de son adversaire, peuvent également servir à
l'usage de la guerre et à des usages pacifiques.
</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>§ 9. En cas de saisies ou répressions non justifiées pour cause de
contrebande ou de transport, l'État du capteur sera tenu aux
dommages-intérêts et à la restitution des objets.
</p><p>
§ 10. Un transport parti avant la déclaration de la guerre et sans
connaissance obligée de son imminence n'est pas punissable.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Penalty according to the Declaration of London for Carriage
of Contraband.</p></div>

<p>§ 406. The Declaration of London offers by articles
39 to 44 a settlement of the controversy respecting the
penalty for carriage of contraband which represents a
fair compromise.</p>

<p>The chief rule is (article 39) that contraband goods,
whether absolute or conditional contraband, may be
confiscated. The carrying vessel may (article 40)
likewise be confiscated if the contraband reckoned
either by value, weight, volume, or freight, forms more
than half the cargo. If the latter be not the case, and
if the carrying vessel be therefore released, she may
(article 41) be condemned to pay the costs and expenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
incurred by the captor in respect of the proceedings in
the national Prize Court and the custody of the ship
and cargo during the proceedings. But whatever be
the proportion between contraband and innocent goods
on a vessel, innocent goods (article 42) which belong to
the owner of the contraband and are on board the
same carrying vessel, may be confiscated.</p>

<p>If a vessel carrying contraband sails before the outbreak
of war (article 43), or is unaware of a declaration
of contraband which applies to her cargo, or has no
opportunity of discharging her cargo after receiving
such knowledge, the contraband may only be confiscated
on payment of compensation, and the vessel herself
and her innocent cargo may not be confiscated nor may
the vessel be condemned to pay any costs and expenses
incurred by the captor.<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> But there is a presumption
which is not rebuttable with regard to the <i>mens rea</i>
of the vessel. For according to the second paragraph
of article 43 a vessel is considered to have knowledge
of the outbreak of war or of a declaration of contraband
if she leaves an enemy port after the outbreak of hostilities,
or if she leaves a neutral port subsequent to the
notification of the outbreak of hostilities or of the declaration
of contraband to the Power to which such
port belongs, provided such notification was made in
sufficient time.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_857_857" id="Footnote_857_857"></a><a href="#FNanchor_857_857"><span class="label">[857]</span></a> It is obvious that the vessel must be brought into a port
and before a Prize Court if the captor desires to seize the contraband
against compensation. The question as to whether article 44 applies to
such a case, and whether, therefore, the neutral vessel may be allowed
to continue her voyage if the master is willing to hand over the
contraband to the captor, must be answered in the affirmative, provided
that the contraband, reckoned either by value, weight, volume, or
freight, forms less than half the cargo. For article 44 precisely treats
of a case in which the vessel herself is not liable to condemnation <i>on
account of the proportion of the contraband on board</i> (see article 40).</p></div>

<p>The question of pre-emption of conditional contraband
is not mentioned by the Declaration of London. There
is, however, nothing to prevent the several maritime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
Powers from exercising pre-emption in mitigation of
their right of confiscation; the future must show
whether or no they will be inclined to do this.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Seizure of Contraband without Seizure of the Vessel.</p></div>

<p>§ 406<i>a</i>. Hitherto the practice of the several States
has differed&mdash;see above, § <a href="#In_former_times_neither405">405</a>&mdash;with regard to the
question as to whether a vessel which was not herself
liable to condemnation might be allowed to proceed on
her voyage on condition that she handed over the contraband
carried by her to the captor. Great Britain
and some other States answered it in the negative, but
several States in the affirmative. The Declaration of
London, although it upholds the general rule that,
whatever may be the ultimate fate of the vessel, she
must be taken into a port of a Prize Court, admits two
exceptions to the rule:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) According to article 44, a vessel which has been
stopped for carrying contraband and which is not
herself liable to be confiscated on account of the proportion
of contraband on board, may&mdash;not must&mdash;when
the circumstances permit it, be allowed to continue
her voyage in case she hands over the contraband cargo
to the captor. In such a case the captor is at liberty
to destroy the contraband handed over to him. But
the matter must in any case be brought before a Prize
Court. The captor must therefore enter the delivery
of the contraband on the log-book of the vessel so
stopped, and the master of the latter must give duly
certified copies of all relevant papers to the captor.</p>

<p>(2) According to article 54, the captor may&mdash;see
below, § <a href="#That_as_a_rule431">431</a>&mdash;exceptionally, in case of necessity, demand
the handing over, or may proceed himself to the destruction,
of any absolute or conditional contraband
goods found on a vessel which is not herself liable to
condemnation, if the taking of the vessel into the port
of a Prize Court would involve danger to the safety of the
capturing cruiser or to the success of the operations in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
which she is engaged at the time. But the captor
must, nevertheless, bring the case before a Prize Court.
He must, therefore, enter the captured goods on the
log-book of the stopped vessel, and must obtain duly
certified copies of all relevant papers. If the captor
cannot establish the fact before the Prize Court that
he was really compelled to abandon the intention of
bringing in the carrying vessel, he must be condemned
(see article 51) to pay the value of the goods to their
owners if the goods were contraband or if they were
not. And the same is valid in case (article 52) the
seizure or destruction of the goods is held by the Prize
Court to have been justifiable, but not the capture
itself of the carrying vessel.</p>

<p>§ 407. <a name="Before_the_Declaration407" id="Before_the_Declaration407"></a>Before the Declaration of London the term
<i>unneutral service</i> was used by several writers with
reference to the carriage of certain persons and despatches
for the enemy on the part of neutral vessels.
The term has been introduced in order to distinguish
the carriage of persons and despatches for the enemy
from the carriage of contraband, as these were often
confounded with each other. Since contraband consists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
of certain goods only and never of persons or despatches,
a vessel carrying persons and despatches for the enemy
is not thereby actually carrying contraband.<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> And
there is another important difference between the two.
Carriage of contraband need not necessarily, and in most
cases actually does not, take place in the direct service
of the enemy. On the other hand, carriage of persons
and despatches for the enemy always takes place in the
direct service of the enemy, and, consequently, represents
a much more intensive assistance of, and a much
more intimate connection with, the enemy than carriage
of contraband. For these reasons a distinct treatment
of carriage of contraband, on the one hand, and carriage
of persons and despatches, on the other, was certainly
considered desirable by many publicists. Those writers
who did not adopt the term <i>unneutral service</i>, on
account of its somewhat misleading character, preferred<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a>
the expression <i>analogous of contraband</i>, because
in practice maritime transport for the enemy was always
treated in analogy with, although not as, carriage of
contraband.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_858_858" id="Footnote_858_858"></a><a href="#FNanchor_858_858"><span class="label">[858]</span></a> This was recognised in the case of the <i>Yangtsze Insurance
Association</i> v. <i>Indemnity Mutual Marine Assurance Company</i>, L.R.
(1908), 1 K.B. 910 and 2 K.B. 504.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_859_859" id="Footnote_859_859"></a><a href="#FNanchor_859_859"><span class="label">[859]</span></a> It was also preferred in the first edition of this work.
But it was necessary to abandon further resistance on account of the
fact that after the official adoption, in the translation of the
Declaration of London, of the term <i>unneutral service</i> it was useless to
oppose it.</p></div>

<p>The Declaration of London puts the whole matter
upon a new and very much enlarged basis, for Chapter
III. treats in articles 45 to 47, under the heading <i>De
l'assistance hostile</i>&mdash;the official English translation of
which is <i>unneutral service</i>&mdash;not only of the carriage of
persons for the enemy on the part of a neutral vessel,
but also of the transmission of intelligence in the interest
of the enemy, the taking of a direct part in the hostilities,
and a number of other acts on the part of a
neutral vessel. Accordingly the Declaration of London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
makes a distinction between two kinds of unneutral
service, meting out for the one a treatment analogous
in a general way to contraband, and for the other a
treatment analogous to that of enemy merchant vessels.
Carriage of individual members of the armed forces of
the enemy and a certain case of transmission of intelligence
in the interest of the enemy constitute the first
kind, and four groups of acts creating enemy character
for the vessel concerned constitute the second kind.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_860_860" id="Footnote_860_860"></a><a href="#FNanchor_860_860"><span class="label">[860]</span></a> Although&mdash;see above, §§ <a href="#The_purpose_of_war173">173</a> and <a href="#As_regards_means174">174</a>&mdash;prevention of
unneutral service to the enemy is a means of sea warfare, it chiefly
concerns neutral commerce, and is, therefore, more conveniently treated
with neutrality.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Carriage of Persons for the Enemy.</p></div>

<p>§ 408. Either belligerent may punish neutral vessels
for carrying, in the service of the enemy, certain
persons.</p>

<p>Such persons included, according to the customary
rules of International Law hitherto prevailing, not
only members of the armed forces of the enemy, but
also individuals who were not yet members of the
armed forces but who would have become so as soon as
they reached their place of destination, and, thirdly,
non-military individuals in the service of the enemy
either in such a prominent position that they could be
made prisoners of war, or who were going abroad as
agents for the purpose of fostering the cause of the
enemy. Thus, for instance, if the head of the enemy
State or one of his cabinet ministers fled the country
to avoid captivity, the neutral vessel that carried him
could have been punished, as could also the vessel
carrying an agent of the enemy sent abroad to negotiate
a loan and the like. However, the mere fact that
enemy persons were on board a neutral vessel did not
in itself prove that these persons were carried by the
vessel for the enemy and in his service. This was the
case only when either the vessel knew of the character
of the persons and nevertheless carried them, thereby
acting in the service of the enemy, or when the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
was directly hired by the enemy for the purpose of
transport of the individuals concerned. Thus, for
instance, if able-bodied men booked their passages on
a neutral vessel to an enemy port with the secret intention
of enlisting in the forces of the enemy, the
vessel could not be considered as carrying persons for
the enemy; but she could be so considered if an agent
of the enemy openly booked their passages. Thus,
further, if the fugitive head of the enemy State booked
his passage under a false name, and concealed his
identity from the vessel, she could not be considered
as carrying a person for the enemy; but she could be so
considered if she knew whom she was carrying, because
she was then aware that she was acting in the service
of the enemy. As regards a vessel directly hired by
the enemy, there could be no doubt that she was acting
in the service of the enemy. Thus the American vessel
<i>Orozembo</i><a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a> was in 1807, during war between England
and the Netherlands, captured and condemned, because,
although chartered by a merchant in Lisbon
ostensibly to sail in ballast to Macao and to take from
there a cargo to America, she received by order of the
charterer three Dutch officers and two Dutch civil
servants, and sailed, not to Macao, but to Batavia.
And the American vessel <i>Friendship</i><a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> was likewise in
1807, during war between England and France, captured
and condemned, because she was hired by the French
Government to carry ninety shipwrecked officers and
sailors home to a French port.</p>

<p>According to British practice hitherto prevailing, a
neutral vessel was considered as carrying persons in
the service of the enemy even if she were, through the
application of force, constrained by the enemy to carry
the persons, or if she were in <i>bona-fide</i> ignorance of the
status of her passengers. Thus, in 1802, during war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
between Great Britain and France, the Swedish vessel
<i>Carolina</i><a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> was condemned by Sir William Scott for
having carried French troops from Egypt to Italy,
although the master endeavoured to prove that the
vessel was obliged by force to render the transport
service. And the above-mentioned vessel <i>Orozembo</i>
was condemned<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> by Sir William Scott, although her
master was ignorant of the service for the enemy on
which he was engaged: "... In cases of <i>bona-fide</i>
ignorance there may be no actual delinquency; but
if the service is injurious, that will be sufficient to give
the belligerent a right to prevent the thing from being
done or at least repeated," said Sir William Scott.<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a></p>

Holland, <i>Prize Law</i>, §§ 90-91. Hall,
§ 249, p. 700, note 2, reprobates the
British practice. During the Russo-Japanese
War only one case of condemnation
of a neutral vessel for
carrying persons for the enemy is
recorded, that of the <i>Nigretia</i>, a vessel
which endeavoured to carry into
Vladivostock the escaped captain and
lieutenant of the Russian destroyer
<i>Ratzoporni</i>; see Takahashi, pp. 639-641.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_865_865" id="Footnote_865_865"></a><a href="#FNanchor_865_865"><span class="label">[865]</span></a> It should be mentioned that,
according to the customary law
hitherto prevailing, the case of
diplomatic agents sent by the enemy
to neutral States was an exception
to the rule that neutral vessels may
be punished for carrying agents sent
by the enemy. The importance of
this exception became apparent in
the case of the <i>Trent</i> which occurred
during the American War. On
November 8, 1861, the Federal cruiser
<i>San Jacinto</i> stopped the British mail
steamer <i>Trent</i> on her voyage from
Havana to the British port of Nassau,
in the Bahamas, forcibly took off
Messrs. Mason and Slidell, together
with their secretaries, political agents
sent by the Confederate States to
Great Britain and France, and then
let the vessel continue her voyage.
Great Britain demanded their immediate
release, and the United
States at once granted this, although
the ground on which release was
granted was not identical with the
ground on which release was demanded.
The Government of the
United States maintained that the
removal of these men from the vessel
without bringing her before a Prize
Court for trial was irregular, and,
therefore, not justified, whereas release
was demanded on the ground
that a neutral vessel could not be
prevented from carrying diplomatic
agents sent by the enemy to neutrals.
Now diplomatic agents in the proper
sense of the term these gentlemen
were not, because although they were
sent by the Confederate States, the
latter were not recognised as such,
but only as a belligerent Power. Yet
these gentlemen were political agents
of a quasi-diplomatic character, and
the standpoint of Great Britain was
for this reason perhaps correct. The
fact that the Governments of France,
Austria, and Prussia protested through
their diplomatic envoys in Washington
shows at least that neutral vessels
may carry unhindered diplomatic
agents sent by the enemy to neutrals,
however doubtful it may be whether
the same is valid regarding agents
with a quasi-diplomatic character.

<p>According to the Declaration of London neutral
merchantmen may, apart from the case of the carriage
of persons who in the course of the voyage directly
assist the operations of the enemy, only be considered
to render unneutral service by carrying such enemy
persons as are actually already members of the armed
forces of the enemy. Article 45 makes it quite apparent,
through using the words "<i>embodied</i> in the armed
forces," that reservists and the like who are on their
way to the enemy country for the purpose of there
joining the armed forces, do not belong to such enemy
persons as a neutral vessel may not carry without
exposing herself to punishment for rendering unneutral
service to the enemy. And four different cases
of carrying enemy persons must be distinguished according
to the Declaration of London, namely: that of
a neutral vessel exclusively engaged in the transport
of enemy troops; that of a vessel transporting a military
detachment of the enemy; that of a vessel transporting
one or more persons who in the course of the voyage
directly assist the operations of the enemy; that of a
vessel transporting, on a voyage specially undertaken,
individual members of the armed forces of the enemy.</p>

<p>(1) According to article 46, No. 4, a neutral vessel
exclusively intended at the time for the transport of
enemy troops acquires thereby enemy character. This
case will be considered with others of the same kind
below in § <a href="#In_contradistinction410">410</a>.</p>

<p>(2) In case a vessel, although she is not exclusively
therefor destined, and although she is not on a voyage
specially undertaken for that purpose, transports, to
the knowledge of either the owner or the charterer or
the master, a military detachment of the enemy, she
is, according to article 45, No. 2, considered to render
unneutral service for which she may be punished.
Accordingly, if to the knowledge of either the owner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
or the charterer or the master, a neutral vessel <i>in the
ordinary course of her voyage</i> carries a military detachment
of the enemy, she is liable to be seized for unneutral
service.</p>

<p>(3) In case a neutral vessel, to the knowledge of
either the owner or the charterer or the master, carries
one or more persons&mdash;subjects of one of the belligerents
or of a neutral Power&mdash;who in the course of the voyage
directly assist the operations of the enemy in any way,
for instance by signalling or sending message by wireless
telegraphy, she is, according to article 45, No. 2, likewise
liable to seizure for rendering unneutral service.</p>

<p>(4) In case a neutral vessel carries individual members
of the armed forces of the enemy, she is, according to
article 45, No. 1, then only liable to seizure if she is on
a voyage specially undertaken for such transport, that
means, if she has been turned from her ordinary course
and has touched at a port outside her ordinary course
for the purpose of embarking, or is going to touch at a
port outside her ordinary course for the purpose of
disembarking, the enemy persons concerned. A liner,
therefore, carrying individual members of the armed
forces of the enemy in the ordinary course of her voyage
may not be considered to be rendering unneutral service
and may not be seized. However, according to article 47,
a neutral vessel carrying members of the armed forces
of the enemy while pursuing her ordinary course, may
be stopped for the purpose of taking off such enemy
persons and making them prisoners of war (see below,
§ <a href="#According_to_the413">413</a>).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Transmission

<p>§ 409. <a name="Either_belligerent409" id="Either_belligerent409"></a>Either belligerent may punish neutral merchantmen
for transmission of intelligence to the enemy.</p>

<p>According to customary rules hitherto in force,
either belligerent might punish neutral vessels for the
carriage of political despatches from or to the enemy,
and especially for such despatches as were in relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
the war. But to this rule there were two exceptions.
Firstly, on the ground that neutrals have a right to
demand that their intercourse with either belligerent
be not suppressed: a neutral vessel might not, therefore,
be punished for carrying despatches from the
enemy to neutral Governments, and <i>vice versa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> and,
further, despatches from the enemy Government to its
diplomatic agents and consuls abroad in neutral States,
and <i>vice versa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> Secondly, on account of article 1 of
Convention XI., by which postal correspondence is
inviolable, except in the case of violation of blockade,
the correspondence destined for, or proceeding from,
the blockaded port. However, the mere fact that a
neutral vessel had political despatches to or from the
enemy on board did not by itself prove that she was
carrying them <i>for and in the service of the enemy</i>. Just
as in the case of certain enemy persons on board, so in
the case of despatches, the vessel was only considered
to be carrying them in the service of the enemy if either
she knew of their character and had nevertheless taken
them on board, or if she was directly hired for the purpose
of carrying them. Thus, the American vessel <i>Rapid</i>,<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a>
which was captured in 1810 during the war between
Great Britain and the Netherlands, on her voyage from
New York to Tonningen, for having on board a despatch
for a Cabinet Minister of the Netherlands hidden under
a cover addressed to a merchant at Tonningen, was
released by the Prize Court. On the other hand, the
<i>Atalanta</i>,<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a> which carried despatches in a tea chest
hidden in the trunk of a supercargo, was condemned.<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

whether the vessel must know of the character of the despatch which she
is carrying. In spite of the case of the <i>Rapid</i>, quoted above, Holland,
<i>Prize Law</i>, § 100, maintains that ignorance of the master of the vessel
is no excuse, and Phillimore, III. § 272, seems to be of the same
opinion.</p></div>

<p>According to the Declaration of London the carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
of despatches for the enemy may only be punished in
case it falls under the category of transmitting intelligence
to the enemy on the part of a neutral vessel. Two
kinds of such transmission of intelligence must be
distinguished:&mdash;</p>

<p>Firstly, according to article 46, No. 4, a neutral
vessel exclusively intended for the transmission of
intelligence to the enemy acquires thereby enemy
character; this will be considered with other cases of
the same kind below in § <a href="#In_contradistinction410">410</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, according to article 45, No. 1, a neutral
vessel may be seized for transmitting intelligence to the
enemy if she is on a voyage specially undertaken for
such transmission, that is to say, if she has been turned
from her ordinary course and has touched or is going
to touch at a port outside her ordinary course for the
purpose of transmitting intelligence to the enemy. A
liner, therefore, transmitting intelligence to the enemy
in the ordinary course of her voyage may not be considered
to be rendering unneutral service and may not
be punished. However, self-preservation would in a
case of necessity justify a belligerent in temporarily
detaining such a liner for the purpose of preventing
the intelligence from reaching the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_871_871" id="Footnote_871_871"></a><a href="#FNanchor_871_871"><span class="label">[871]</span></a> See
 below, § <a href="#According_to_the413">413</a>.</p></div>

<p>The conception "transmission of intelligence" is
not defined by the Declaration of London. It certainly
means not only oral transmission of intelligence, but
also the transmission of despatches containing intelligence.
The transmission of any political intelligence
of value to the enemy, whether or no the intelligence is
in relation to the war, must be considered unneutral
service, the case excepted in which intelligence is transmitted
from the enemy to neutral Governments, and
vice versa, and, further, from the enemy Government to
its diplomatic agents and consuls abroad in neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
States. And it must be emphasised that, although a
vessel may be seized and punished for unneutral service,
according to article 1 of Convention XI. of the Second
Hague Peace Conference the postal correspondence of
neutrals or belligerents, whatever its character, found
on board is inviolable.</p>

<p>§ 410. <a name="In_contradistinction410" id="In_contradistinction410"></a>In contradistinction to cases of unneutral
service which are similar to carriage of contraband, the
Declaration of London enumerates in article 46 four
cases of such kinds of unneutral service as vest neutral
vessels with enemy character.<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a></p>

<p>(1) There is, firstly, the case of a neutral merchantman
taking a direct part in the hostilities. This may
occur in several ways, but such vessel in every case
loses her neutral and acquires enemy character, just
as a subject of a neutral Power who enlists in the ranks
of the enemy armed forces. But a distinction must be
made between taking a direct part in the hostilities,
for instance rendering assistance to the enemy fleet
during battle, on the one hand, and, on the other, acts
of a piratical character. If a neutral merchantman&mdash;see
above, §§ <a href="#In_a_sense_the_crews85">85</a>, 181, and <a href="#Since_International_Law254">254</a>&mdash;without Letters of
Marque during war and from hatred of one of the
belligerents, were to attack and sink merchantmen of
such belligerent, she would have to be considered, and
could therefore be treated as, a pirate.</p>

<p>(2) There is, secondly, the case of a neutral vessel
which sails under the orders or the control of an agent
placed on board by the enemy Government. The
presence of such agent, and the fact that the vessel
sails under his orders or control shows clearly that she
is really for all practical purposes part and parcel of
the enemy forces.</p>

<p>(3) There is, thirdly, the case of a neutral vessel in
the exclusive employment of the enemy. This may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
occur in two different ways: either the vessel may be
rendering a specific service in the exclusive employment
of the enemy, as, for instance, did those German merchantmen
during the Russo-Japanese War which acted
as colliers for the Russian fleet <i>en route</i> for the Far
East; or the vessel may be chartered by the enemy so
that she is entirely at his disposal for any purpose he
may choose, whether such purpose is or is not connected
with the war.<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a></p>

<p>(4) There is, fourthly and lastly, the case of a neutral
merchantman exclusively intended at the time either
for the transport of enemy troops or for the transmission
of intelligence for the enemy. This case is different
from the case&mdash;provided for by article 45, No. 1&mdash;of a
vessel on a voyage specially undertaken with a view to
the carriage of individual members of the armed forces
of the enemy. Whereas the latter is a case of unneutral
service rendered by a vessel which turns from
her course for the purpose of rendering specific service,
the former is a case in which the vessel is exclusively
and for the time being permanently intended and
devoted to the rendering of unneutral service. For
the time being she is, therefore, actually part and
parcel of the enemy marine. For this reason she is
considered to be rendering unneutral service, and to
have lost her neutral character, even if, at the moment
an enemy cruiser searches her, she is engaged neither in
the transport of troops nor in the transmission of
intelligence. The fact is decisive that she is for the
time being exclusively intended for such unneutral
service, whether or no she is at every moment really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
engaged in rendering such service. And it makes no
difference, whether the vessel is engaged by the enemy
and paid for the transport of troops or the transmission
of intelligence, or whether she renders the service<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a>
gratuitously.</p>

Russo-Japanese War. The <i>Industrie</i>, a German vessel, and the
<i>Quang-nam</i>, a French vessel, were captured and condemned by the
Japanese for being in the employ of Russia as reconnoitring vessels,
although the former pretended to collect news in the service of the
Chefoo <i>Daily News</i>, and the latter pretended to be a cargo vessel
plying between neutral ports. See Takahashi, pp. 732 and 735.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Capture for Unneutral Service.</p></div>

<p>§ 411. <a name="According_to411" id="According_to411"></a>According to customary rules hitherto prevailing,
as well as according to the Declaration of
London, a neutral vessel may be captured if visit or
search establish the fact, or grave suspicion of the fact,
that she is rendering unneutral service to the enemy.
And such capture may take place anywhere throughout
the range of the Open Sea and the territorial maritime
belt of either belligerent.</p>

<p>Stress must be laid on the fact that mail steamers
are on principle not exempt from capture for unneutral
service. Although, according to article 1 of Convention
XI., the postal correspondence of belligerents as well
as of neutrals, whatever its official or private character,
found on board a vessel on the sea is inviolable,<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> and a
vessel may never, therefore, be considered to be rendering
unneutral service by carrying amongst her postal
correspondence despatches containing intelligence for
the enemy, a mail steamer is nevertheless&mdash;see article
2 of Convention XI.&mdash;not exempt from the laws and
customs of naval war respecting neutral merchantmen.
A mail boat is, therefore, quite as much as any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
merchantman, exposed to capture for rendering unneutral
service.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_875_875" id="Footnote_875_875"></a><a href="#FNanchor_875_875"><span class="label">[875]</span></a> See above, §§ <a href="#No_general_rule191">191</a> and <a href="#The_duty_of_either319">319</a>.</p></div>

<p>However this may be, capture is allowed only so
long as the vessel is <i>in delicto</i>, that is during the time
in which she is rendering the unneutral service concerned
or immediately afterwards while she is being
chased for having rendered unneutral service. A
neutral vessel may not, therefore, be captured after
the completion of a voyage specially undertaken for the
purpose of transporting members of the armed forces
of the enemy, or of transmitting intelligence for the
enemy, or after having disembarked the military detachment
of the enemy and the persons directly assisting
the operations of the enemy in the course of the
voyage whom she was transporting. And it must be
specially emphasised that even such neutral vessel as
had acquired&mdash;see article 46 of the Declaration of
London&mdash;enemy character by rendering unneutral
service, ceases to be <i>in delicto</i> after her unneutral
service has come to an end. Thus, for instance, a
neutral vessel which took a direct part in hostilities<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a>
may not afterwards be captured, nor may a vessel
which has disembarked the agent of the enemy Government
under whose orders or control she was navigating.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_876_876" id="Footnote_876_876"></a><a href="#FNanchor_876_876"><span class="label">[876]</span></a> Provided she did not&mdash;see
above, § <a href="#In_contradistinction410">410</a> (1)&mdash;commit acts of a piratical
character; for such acts she may
always be punished.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Penalty
for Unneutral
Service.</p></div>

<p>§ 412. <a name="According_to412" id="According_to412"></a>According to the practice hitherto prevailing,
a neutral vessel captured for carriage of persons or
despatches in the service of the enemy could be confiscated.
Moreover, according to British<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> practice, such
part of the cargo as belonged to the owner of the vessel
was likewise confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_878_878" id="FNanchor_878_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> And if the vessel was not
found guilty of carrying persons or despatches in the
service of the enemy, and was not therefore condemned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
the Government of the captor could nevertheless detain
the persons as prisoners of war and confiscate the
despatches, provided the persons and despatches concerned
were in any way of such a character as to make
a vessel, which was cognisant of this character, liable
to punishment for transporting them for the enemy.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_877_877" id="Footnote_877_877"></a><a href="#FNanchor_877_877"><span class="label">[877]</span></a> The <i>Friendship</i> (1807), 6 C. Rob.

C. Rob. 463, note.</p></div>

<p>The Declaration of London recognises these three
rules. Articles 45 and 46 declare any vessel rendering
any kind of unneutral service to the enemy liable to
confiscation, and likewise declare such part of the cargo
as belongs to the owner of the confiscated vessel liable
to confiscation. And article 47 enacts that, although
a neutral vessel may not be condemned because there
are no grounds for her capture, the capturing State may
nevertheless detain as prisoners of war any members of
the armed forces of the enemy who were found on board
the vessel. The case of despatches found on board is
not mentioned by article 47, but there ought to be no
doubt&mdash;see
 below, § <a href="#According_to_the413">413</a>&mdash;that the old customary rule
that, although the vessel may not be condemned because
there is no ground for capture, any despatches for the
enemy found on board may, in analogy with article 47,
be confiscated, provided such despatches are not part of
the postal correspondence carried on board.</p>

<p>It must be emphasised that the mere fact that a
neutral vessel is rendering unneutral service, is not
sufficient for her condemnation; for in addition <i>mens rea</i>
is required. Now as regards the four kinds of unneutral
service which create enemy character, <i>mens rea</i>
is obviously always in existence, and therefore always
presumed to be present. For this reason article 46, in
contradistinction to article 45, does not mention anything
concerning the knowledge by the vessel of the
outbreak of hostilities. But as regards the other cases
of unneutral service, article 45 provides that the vessel
may not be confiscated if the vessel is encountered at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
sea while unaware of the outbreak of hostilities, or if
the master, after becoming aware of the outbreak of
hostilities, has had no opportunity of disembarking
the passengers concerned. On the other hand, a vessel
is deemed, according to article 45, to be aware of the
existence of a state of war if she left an enemy port
subsequent to the outbreak of hostilities, or a neutral
port subsequent to the notification of the outbreak of
hostilities to the Power to which such port belongs,
provided that such notification was made in sufficient
time.</p>

<p>Although the Declaration of London metes out the
same punishment for the several kinds of unneutral
service which it enumerates, it nevertheless makes a
distinction, apart from the penalty, with regard to the
treatment of the vessels captured for rendering unneutral
service.</p>

<p>Article 45 provides for a neutral vessel captured for
having rendered either of the two kinds of unneutral
service mentioned in this article a treatment which is,
in a general way, the same as that for a neutral vessel
captured for the carriage of contraband. This means
that the vessel does not lose her neutral character, and
must under all circumstances and conditions be taken
before a Prize Court, unless&mdash;see article 49 of the
Declaration of London&mdash;the taking of her into a port
of the capturing State would involve danger to the
safety of the capturing vessel or to the success of the
military operations in which she is engaged at the time.
And an appeal from the national Prize Courts may be
brought to the International Prize Court.</p>

<p>Article 46, on the other hand, provides, apart
from the penalty, a treatment for a vessel captured
for having rendered any of the four kinds of unneutral
service enumerated in this article which, in a general
way, is the same as that for a captured enemy merchantman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
This means that such vessel acquires enemy
character. Accordingly (see above, § <a href="#The_general_rule89">89</a>) all enemy
goods on the vessel may be seized, all goods on board
will be presumed to be enemy goods, and the owners
of neutral goods on board will have to prove the neutral
character of their goods. Further, the rules of articles
48 and 49 of the Declaration of London concerning the
destruction of neutral vessels do not apply. Again, no
appeal may be brought from the national Prize Courts
to the International Prize Court by the owner of the
ship except concerning the one question only, namely,
whether the act of which she is accused has the character
of unneutral service.<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_879_879" id="Footnote_879_879"></a><a href="#FNanchor_879_879"><span class="label">[879]</span></a> The question as to whether, if the vessel has been
destroyed by the captor, the innocent owners of the neutral goods on
board may claim compensation, has to be decided in the same way as the
question as to whether the owners of neutral goods on a destroyed enemy
merchantman have a claim to compensation; see above, § <a href="#Since_through_adjudication194">194</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Seizure of Enemy Persons and Despatches without Seizure of
Vessel.</p></div>

<p>§ 413. <a name="According_to_the413" id="According_to_the413"></a>According to the British<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> and American
practice, as well as that of some other States, which
has hitherto prevailed, whenever a neutral vessel was
stopped for carrying persons or despatches for the
enemy, these could not be seized unless the vessel were
seized at the same time. The release, in 1861, during
the American Civil War, of Messrs. Mason<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> and Slidell,
who had been forcibly taken off the <i>Trent</i>, while the
ship herself was allowed to continue her voyage, was
based, by the United States, on the fact that the
seizure of these men without the seizure of the vessel
was illegal. Since, according to the Declaration of
London, a neutral vessel rendering unneutral service
of any kind is liable to be confiscated, it is evident that
in such a case the enemy persons and despatches concerned
may not be taken off the vessel unless the vessel
herself is seized and brought into a port of a Prize Court.
However, article 47 provides that any member of the
armed forces of the enemy found on board a neutral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
merchant vessel may be taken off and made a prisoner
of war, although there may be no ground for the capture
of the vessel. Therefore, if a vessel carries individual
members of the armed forces of the enemy in the
ordinary course of her voyage,<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a> or if she transports a
military detachment of the enemy and the like without
being aware of the outbreak of hostilities, the members
of the armed forces of the enemy on board may be
seized, although the vessel herself may not be seized, as
she is not rendering unneutral service.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_880_880" id="Footnote_880_880"></a><a href="#FNanchor_880_880"><span class="label">[880]</span></a> See Holland, <i>Prize Law</i>, § 104.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_881_881" id="Footnote_881_881"></a><a href="#FNanchor_881_881"><span class="label">[881]</span></a> See
above, § <a href="#Footnote_865_865">408, p. 519, note 3</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_882_882" id="Footnote_882_882"></a><a href="#FNanchor_882_882"><span class="label">[882]</span></a> Accordingly, in January 1912, during the Turco-Italian War,
the Italian gunboat <i>Volturno</i>, after having overhauled, in the Red Sea,
the British steamer <i>Africa</i> going from Hodeida to Aden, took off and
made prisoners of war Colonel Riza Bey and eleven other Turkish
officers. Although the Declaration of London is not yet ratified by
Great Britain, she did not protest. The case of the <i>Manouba</i> ought
likewise to be mentioned here. This French steamer, which plies between
Marseilles and Tunis, was stopped on January 16, 1912, by an Italian
cruiser in the Mediterranean, and twenty-nine Turkish passengers, who
were supposed to be Turkish officers on their way to the theatre of war,
were forcibly taken off and made prisoners. On the protest of France,
the captives were handed over to her in order to ascertain whether they
were members of the Turkish forces, and it was agreed between the
parties that the case should be settled by an arbitral award of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, Italy asserting that she
had only acted in accordance with article 47 of the Declaration of
London.</p></div>

<p>The Declaration of London does not mention the
case of enemy despatches embodying intelligence found
on board such a neutral vessel as may not herself be
captured for such carriage. For instance, in the case
of a mail steamer pursuing her ordinary course and
carrying a despatch of the enemy not in her mail bags
but separately, the vessel may not, according to article 45,
be seized. In this, and similar cases, may despatches
be seized without the seizure of the vessel? It has
been pointed out above, § <a href="#Either_belligerent409">409</a>, that, in a case of necessity,
self-preservation would justify a belligerent in
temporarily detaining such a liner for the purpose of
preventing the intelligence from reaching the enemy.
This certainly fits the case of a vessel transmitting oral
intelligence. But if a vessel carried despatches, the
necessity of detaining her ceases through seizure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
despatches themselves. The question&mdash;see above,
§ <a href="#According_to412">412</a>&mdash;as to whether in such cases the despatches may
be seized without seizure of the vessel ought, therefore,
in analogy with article 47 of the Declaration of London,
to be answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Quite different from the case of seizure of such
enemy persons and despatches as a vessel cannot carry
without exposing herself to punishment, is the case<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a>
where a vessel has such enemy persons and despatches
on board as she is allowed to carry, but whom a belligerent
believes it to be necessary in the interest of
self-preservation to seize. Since necessity in the interest
of self-preservation is, according to International
Law, an excuse<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> for an illegal act, a belligerent may
seize such persons and despatches, provided that such
seizure is not merely desirable, but absolutely necessary<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a>
in the interest of self-preservation, as, for instance, in
the case where an Ambassador of the enemy on board
a neutral vessel is on the way to submit to a neutral a
draft treaty of alliance injurious to the other belligerent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Conception

Right of
Visitation.</p></div>

<p>§ 414. Right of visitation<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> is the right of belligerents
to visit and eventually search neutral merchantmen
for the purpose of ascertaining whether these vessels
really belong to the merchant marine of neutrals, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
if this is found to be the case, whether they are attempting
to break a blockade, or carry contraband, or render
unneutral service to the enemy. The right of visit
and search was already mentioned in the <i>Consolato del
Mare</i>, and although it has often<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> been contested, its
<i>raison d'être</i> is so obvious that it has long been universally
recognised in practice. It is indeed the only means by
which belligerents are able to ascertain whether neutral
merchantmen intend to bring assistance to the enemy
and to render him unneutral services.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_886_886" id="Footnote_886_886"></a><a href="#FNanchor_886_886"><span class="label">[886]</span></a> It must be borne in mind that this right of visitation is
not an independent right but is involved in the right of either
belligerent&mdash;see above, § <a href="#There_are_two_rights314">314</a>&mdash;to punish neutral vessels breaking
blockade, carrying contraband, and rendering unneutral service.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_887_887" id="Footnote_887_887"></a><a href="#FNanchor_887_887"><span class="label">[887]</span></a> See, for instance, Hübner, <i>De la saisie des bâtiments

des prises maritimes</i>, adopted at Heidelberg in 1887 by the Institute of
International Law; §§ 1-29 regulate visit and search. See <i>Annuaire</i>,
IX. (1888), p. 202.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Right of Visitation, by whom, when, and where exercised.</p></div>

<p>§ 415. The right of visit and search may be exercised
by all warships<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> of belligerents. But since it is a
belligerent right, it may, of course, only be exercised
after the outbreak and before the end of war. The
right of visitation on the part of men-of-war of all
nations in time of peace in a case of suspicion of piracy&mdash;see
above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#Ve2of266">vol. I. § 266 (2)</a>&mdash;has nothing to do with
the right of visit and search on the part of belligerents.
And since an armistice does not bring war to an end,
and since, on the other hand, the exercise of the right of
visitation is not an act of warfare, this right may be
exercised during the time of a partial as well as of a
general armistice.<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> The region where the right may be
exercised is the maritime territorial belt of either
belligerent, and, further, the Open Sea, but not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
maritime territorial belt of neutrals. Whether the
part of the Open Sea in which a belligerent man-of-war
meets with a neutral merchantman is near or far
away from that part of the world where hostilities are
actually taking place makes no difference so long as
there is suspicion against the vessel. The question as
to whether the men-of-war of a belligerent may exercise
the right of visitation in the maritime territorial belt
of an ally is one between the latter and the belligerent
exclusively, provided such an ally is already a belligerent.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_889_889" id="Footnote_889_889"></a><a href="#FNanchor_889_889"><span class="label">[889]</span></a> It should be mentioned that privateers could also exercise
the right of visit and search. But since even such States as have not
acceded to the Declaration of Paris in practice no longer issue Letters
of Marque, such a case will no longer occur.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_890_890" id="Footnote_890_890"></a><a href="#FNanchor_890_890"><span class="label">[890]</span></a> But this is not universally recognised. Thus, Hautefeuille,
III. p. 91, maintains that during a general armistice the right of
visitation may not be exercised, and § 5 of the <i>Règlement international
des prises maritimes</i> of the Institute of International Law takes up the
same attitude. It ought, likewise, to be mentioned that in strict law
the right of visit and search may be exercised even after the conclusion
of peace before the treaty of peace is ratified. But the above-mentioned
§ 5 of the <i>Règlement international des prises maritimes</i> declares this
right to cease "avec les préliminaires de la paix." See below, § <a href="#It_is_a_moot_question436">436</a>.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Only Private Vessels may be Visited.</p></div>

<p>§ 416. During the nineteenth century it became
universally recognised that neutral men-of-war are not
objects of the right of visit and search of belligerents.<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
And the same is valid regarding public neutral vessels
which sail in the service of armed forces, such as
transport vessels, for instance. Doubt exists as to the
position of public neutral vessels which do not sail in
the service of armed forces, but sail for other purposes,
as, for instance, mail-boats belonging to a neutral
State. It is asserted<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> that, if commanded by an
officer of the Navy, they must be treated in the same
way as men-of-war, but that it is desirable to ask the
commanders to give their word of honour assuring the
absence of contraband and unneutral service.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Vessels

<p>§ 417. <a name="Sweden_in417" id="Sweden_in417"></a>Sweden in 1653, during war between Great
Britain and the Netherlands, claimed that the belligerents
ought to waive their right of visitation over
Swedish merchantmen if the latter sailed under the
convoy of a Swedish man-of-war whose commander
asserted the absence of contraband on board the convoyed
vessels. The Peace of Westminster in 1654
brought this war to an end, and in 1756 the Netherlands,
then neutral, claimed the right of convoy. But it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
not until the last quarter of the eighteenth century that
the right of convoy was more and more insisted upon
by Continental neutrals. During the American War
of Independence in 1780, the Netherlands again claimed
that right, and when they themselves in 1781 waged
war against Great Britain, they ordered their men-of-war
and privateers to respect the right of convoy.
Between 1780 and 1800 treaties were concluded, in
which Russia, Austria, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden,
France, the United States of America, and other States
recognised that right. But Great Britain always
refused to recognise it, and in July 1800 the action of a
British squadron in capturing a Danish man-of-war
and her convoy of six merchantmen for resistance to
visitation called the Second Armed Neutrality into
existence. Yet Great Britain still resisted, and by
article 4 of the "Maritime Convention" of St. Petersburg
of June 17, 1801, she conceded to Russia only that
vessels under convoy should not be visited by privateers.
During the nineteenth century more and more treaties
stipulating the right of convoy were concluded, but
this right was not mentioned in the Declaration of
Paris of 1856, and Great Britain refused to recognise
it throughout the century. However, Great Britain
abandoned her opposition at the Naval Conference of
London of 1908-9, and the Declaration of London
proposes to settle the matter by articles 61 and 62 in
the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p>Neutral vessels under the convoy of a man-of-war
flying the same flag are exempt from search and may
not be visited if the commander of the convoy, at the
request of the commander of the belligerent cruiser
which desires to visit, gives, in writing, all information
as to the character of the convoyed vessels and their
cargoes which could be obtained by search. Should
the commander of the belligerent man-of-war have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
reason to suspect that the confidence of the commander
of the convoy has been abused, he may not
himself resort to visit and search, but must communicate
with the commander of the convoy. The latter must
investigate the matter, and must record the result of
his investigation in a report, a copy of which must be
given to the commander of the belligerent cruiser.
Should, in the opinion of the commander of the convoy,
the facts stated in the report justify the capture of one
or more of the convoyed vessels, he must withdraw
protection from the offending vessels, and the belligerent
cruiser may then capture them.</p>

<p>In case a difference of opinion arises between the
commander of the convoy and the commander of the
belligerent cruiser&mdash;for instance, with regard to the
question as to whether certain goods are absolute or
conditional contraband or as to whether the port of
destination of a convoyed vessel is an ordinary commercial
port or a port which serves as a base of supply
for the armed forces of the enemy and the like&mdash;the
commander of the belligerent cruiser has no power of
overruling the decision of the commander of the convoy.
He can only protest and report the case to his
Government, which will settle the matter by means
of diplomacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>No Universal Rules regarding Mode of Visitation.</p></div>

<p>§ 418. There are no rules of International Law
which lay down all the details of the formalities of
the mode of visitation. A great many treaties regulate
them as between the parties, and all maritime nations
have given instructions to their men-of-war regarding
these formalities. Thereby uniform formalities are
practised with regard to many points, but regarding
others the practice of the several States differs. Article
17 of the Peace Treaty of the Pyrenees of 1659 has
served as a model of many of the above-mentioned
treaties regulating the formalities of visitation: "Les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
navires d'Espagne, pour éviter tout désordre, n'approcheront
pas de plus près les Français que la portée
du canon, et pourront envoyer leur petite barque ou
chaloupe à bord des navires français et faire entrer
dedans deux ou trois hommes seulement, à qui seront
montrés les passeports par le maître du navire français,
par lesquels il puisse apparoir, non seulement de la
charge, mais aussi du lieu de sa demeure et résidence,
et du nom tant du maître ou patron que du navire
même, afin que, par ces deux moyens, on puisse connaître,
s'il porte des marchandises de contrebande; et qu'il
apparaisse suffisamment tant de la qualité du dit navire
que de son maître ou patron; auxquelles passeports on
devra donner entière foi et créance."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Stopping of Vessels for the Purpose of Visitation.</p></div>

<p>§ 419. A man-of-war which wishes to visit a neutral
vessel must stop her or make her bring to. Although
the chasing of vessels may take place under false
colours, the right colours must be shown when vessels
are stopped.<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> The order for stopping can be given<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a>
by hailing or by firing one or two blank cartridges from
the so-called affirming gun, and, if necessary, by firing
a shot across the bows of the vessel. If nevertheless
the vessel does not bring to, the man-of-war is justified
in using force to compel her to bring to. Once the
vessel has been brought to, the man-of-war also brings to,
keeping a reasonable distance. With regard to this distance,
treaties very often stipulate either the range of a
cannon shot or half such width or even a range beyond
a cannon shot; but all this is totally impracticable.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a>
The distance must vary according to the requirements
of the case, and according to wind and weather.</p>

Perels, § 53, pp. 284, 285.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Visit.</p></div>

<p>§ 420. The vessel, having been stopped or brought
to, is visited<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> by one or two officers sent in a boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
from the man-of-war. These officers examine the
papers of the vessel to ascertain her nationality, the
character of her cargo and passengers, and, lastly,
the ports from and to which she is sailing. Instead of
visiting the merchantman and inspecting her papers
on board, the practice is followed, by the men-of-war
of some States, of summoning the master of the merchantman
with his papers on board the former and
examining the papers there.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_896_896" id="Footnote_896_896"></a><a href="#FNanchor_896_896"><span class="label">[896]</span></a> See

195-216.</p></div>

<p>If everything is found in order and there is no
suspicion of fraud, the vessel is allowed to continue
her course, a memorandum of the visit having been
entered in her log-book. On the other hand, if the
inspection of the papers shows that the vessel is carrying
contraband or rendering unneutral service, or that she
is for another reason liable to capture, she is at once
seized. But it may be that, although ostensibly everything
is in order, there is nevertheless grave suspicion
of fraud against the vessel. In such case she may be
searched.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Search.</p></div>

<p>§ 421. Search is effected<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> by one or two officers,
and eventually a few men, in presence of the master
of the vessel. Care must be taken not to damage the
vessel or the cargo, and no force whatever must be
applied. No lock must be forcibly broken open by
the search party, but the master is to be required to
unlock it. If he fails to comply with the demand he
is not to be forced thereto, since the master's refusal
to assist the search in general, or that of a locked part
of the vessel or of a locked box in particular, is at once
sufficient cause for seizing the vessel. Search being
completed, everything removed has to be replaced with
care. If the search has satisfied the searching officers
and dispelled all suspicion, a memorandum is entered
in the log-book of the vessel, and she is allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
continue her voyage. On the other hand, if search
brought contraband or another cause for capture to
light, the vessel is seized. But since search can never
take place so thoroughly on the sea as in a harbour,
it may be that, although search has disclosed no proof
to bear out the suspicion, grave suspicion still remains.
In such case she may be seized and brought into a port
for the purpose of being searched there as thoroughly
as possible. But the commander of a man-of-war
seizing a vessel in such case must bear in mind that full
indemnities must be paid to the vessel for loss of time
and other losses sustained if finally she is found innocent.
Therefore, after a search at sea has brought nothing to
light against the vessel, seizure should take place only
in case of grave suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Consequences of Resistance to Visitation.</p></div>

<p>§ 422. <a name="If_a_neutral422" id="If_a_neutral422"></a>If a neutral merchantman resists visit or
search, she is at once captured, and may be confiscated.
The question as to whether the vessel only, or also her
cargo, could be confiscated for resistance has hitherto
been controversial. According to British<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> and
American theory and practice, the cargo as well as the
vessel was liable to confiscation. But Continental<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a>
writers emphatically argued against this and maintained
that the vessel only was liable to confiscation.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_898_898" id="Footnote_898_898"></a><a href="#FNanchor_898_898"><span class="label">[898]</span></a> The <i>Maria</i> (1799), 1 C. Rob. 340.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_899_899" id="Footnote_899_899"></a><a href="#FNanchor_899_899"><span class="label">[899]</span></a> See Gessner, pp. 318-321.</p></div>

<p>According to article 63 of the Declaration of London,
resistance to the legitimate exercise of the right of visit,
search, and capture involves in all cases the confiscation
of the vessel, which by her forcible resistance has
acquired enemy character (see above, § <a href="#The_general_rule89">89</a>). For this
reason such goods on board as belong to the master
or owner of the vessel are treated as enemy goods and
may be confiscated. Enemy goods on board may now
likewise be confiscated, although when they were first
shipped the vessel bore neutral character. Further, all
goods on board are now presumed to be enemy goods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
and the owners of neutral goods on board will have to
prove the neutral character of their goods. Lastly, no
appeal may be brought from the National Prize Courts
to the International Prize Court by the owner of the
ship except concerning the one question only, namely,
as to whether there was justification for capturing her
on the grounds of forcible resistance.</p>

<p>It must be emphasised that visit and search do
not take place after a vessel has been captured for
resistance, for the mere fact of resisting has imposed
enemy character upon her, and the question is now
irrelevant whether visit and search would show her to
be guilty or innocent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>What constitutes Resistance.</p></div>

<p>§ 423. <a name="According_to423" id="According_to423"></a>According to the practice hitherto prevailing,<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a>
and also according to the Declaration of London, a mere
attempt on the part of a neutral merchantman to
escape visitation does not in itself constitute resistance.
Such vessel may be chased and compelled by force to
bring to, and she cannot complain if, in the endeavour
forcibly to compel her to bring to, she is damaged or
accidentally sunk. If, after the vessel has been compelled
to bring to, visit and search show her to be
innocent, she must be allowed to proceed on her
course.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_900_900" id="Footnote_900_900"></a><a href="#FNanchor_900_900"><span class="label">[900]</span></a> The <i>Maria</i> (1799), 1 C. Rob. 340.</p></div>

<p>Resistance to be penal must be <i>forcible</i> resistance.
It constitutes resistance, therefore, if a vessel applies
force in resisting any legitimate action by the belligerent
cruiser which requires her to stop and to be
visited and searched. The term <i>forcible resistance</i> is
not defined in detail by article 63 of the Declaration
of London. It is, consequently, not certain whether
the actual application of force only, or also the refusal,
on the part of the master, to show the ship papers or to
open locked parts of the vessel or locked boxes, and
similar acts, constitutes forcible resistance. The International<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
Prize Court, if established, would have to
develop a practice which would decide these points.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Sailing under Enemy Convoy equivalent to Resistance.</p></div>

<p>§ 424. Wheaton excepted, all writers would seem
to agree that the fact of neutral merchantmen sailing
under a convoy of enemy men-of-war is equivalent to
forcible resistance on their part, whether they themselves
intend to resist by force or not. But the Government
of the United States of America in 1810 contested
this principle. In that year, during war between
Great Britain and Denmark, many American vessels
sailing from Russia used to seek protection under the
convoy of British men-of-war, whereupon Denmark
declared all such American vessels to be good and
lawful prizes. Several were captured without making
any resistance whatever, and were condemned by
Danish Prize Courts. The United States protested,
and claimed indemnities from Denmark, and in 1830
a treaty between the parties was signed at Copenhagen,<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a>
according to which Denmark had to pay 650,000 dollars
as indemnity. But in article 5 of this treaty the parties
"expressly declare that the present convention is only
applicable to the cases therein mentioned, and, having
no other object, may never hereafter be invoked by one
party or the other as a precedent or a rule for the
future."<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a></p>

was the negotiator of this treaty on the part of the United
States.&mdash;With the case of neutral merchantmen sailing under enemy
convoy, the other case&mdash;see above, § 185&mdash;in which neutral goods are
placed on board an armed enemy vessel is frequently confused. In the
case of the <i>Fanny</i> (1814), 1 Dodson, 443, Sir William Scott condemned
neutral Portuguese property on the ground that placing neutral property
on board an armed vessel was equal to resistance against visitation. But
the Supreme Court of the United States of America, in the of the
<i>Nereide</i> (1815), 9 Cranch, 388, held the contrary view. The Court was

from the majority and considered the British practice correct. See
Phillimore, III. § 341, and Wheaton, § 529.</p></div>

<p>Article 63 of the Declaration of London does not&mdash;as
was pointed out
 above in § <a href="#According_to423">423</a>&mdash;define the term
forcible resistance, but it is to be expected that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
practice of the International Prize Court would consider
the sailing under enemy convoy equivalent to forcible
resistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Resistance by Neutral Convoy.</p></div>

<p>§ 425. Since Great Britain did not, before agreeing
to the Declaration of London, recognise the right of
convoy and had always insisted upon the right of
visitation to be exercised over neutral merchantmen
sailing under the convoy of neutral men-of-war, the
question has arisen as to whether such merchantmen
are considered resisting visitation in case the convoying
men-of-war only, and not the convoyed vessels themselves,
offer resistance. British practice has answered
the question in the affirmative. The rule was laid down
in 1799<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> and in 1804<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> by Sir William Scott in the cases
of Swedish vessels captured while sailing under the
convoy of a Swedish man-of-war.</p>

<p>Since Great Britain&mdash;see above, § <a href="#Sweden_in417">417</a>&mdash;has abandoned
her opposition to the right of convoy and has
agreed to articles 61 and 62 of the Declaration of
London which lay down rules concerning the matter,
the resistance by a neutral convoy to visitation may not,
under ordinary circumstances, be considered to be resistance
on the part of the convoyed neutral merchantman.
If, however, the commander of a convoy, after
having refused to give the written information mentioned
in article 61 or to allow the investigation mentioned
in article 62, forcibly resists visitation of the
convoyed merchantmen by a belligerent cruiser, the
question as to whether resistance by a convoy is equivalent
to resistance by a convoyed vessel, may even
under the Declaration of London arise.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Deficiency
of Papers.</p></div>

<p>§ 426. <a name="Since_the_purpose426" id="Since_the_purpose426"></a>Since the purpose of visit is to ascertain
the nationality of a vessel, the character of her cargo
and passengers, and the ports from and to which she is
sailing, it is obvious that this purpose cannot be realised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
in case the visited vessel is deficient in her papers. As
stated
 above in <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#Al262">Vol. I. § 262</a>, every merchantman ought
to carry the following papers: (1) A certificate of
registry or a sea-letter (passport); (2) the muster-roll;
(3) the log-book; (4) the manifest of cargo; (5) bills
of lading, and (6) if chartered, the charter-party. Now,
if a vessel is visited and cannot produce one or more
of the papers mentioned, she is suspect. Search is,
of course, admissible for the purpose of verifying the
suspicion, but it may be that, although search has
not produced any proof of guilt, the suspicion is not
dispelled. In such case she may be seized and brought
to a port for thorough examination. But, with the
exception of the case that she cannot produce either
certificate of registry or a sea-letter (passport), she
ought not to be confiscated for deficiency in papers
only. Yet, if the cargo is also suspect, or if there are
other circumstances which increase the suspicion, confiscation
would be, I believe, in the discretion of the
Prize Court.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London does not mention the
point, and the International Prize Court would, therefore,
have to evolve a system of rules to be applied in
cases concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Spoliation, Defacement, and Concealment of Papers.</p></div>

<p>§ 427. Mere deficiency of papers does not arouse
the same suspicion which a vessel incurs if she destroys<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
or throws overboard any of her papers, defaces
them or conceals them, and in especial in case the
spoliation of papers takes place at the time when the
visiting vessel comes in sight. Whatever her cargo
may be, a vessel may at once be seized without further
search so soon as it becomes apparent that spoliation,
defacement, or concealment of papers has taken place.
The practice of the several States has hitherto differed
with regard to other consequences of spoliation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>

in case other circumstances increase the

<p>The Declaration of London does not mention the
case of spoliation of papers, and it would therefore be
the task of the International Prize Court to evolve a

<div class="sidenote"><p>Double and False Papers.</p></div>

<p>§ 428. The highest suspicion is aroused through the
fact that a visited vessel carries double papers, or false<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a>
papers, and such vessel may certainly be seized. But
the practice of the several States has hitherto differed
with regard to the question whether confiscation is
admissible for the mere fact of carrying double or
false papers. Whereas the practice of some States, as
Russia and Spain, answered the question in the affirmative,
British<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> and American<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> practice took a more
lenient view, and condemned such vessels only on a
clear inference that the false or double papers were
carried for the purpose of deceiving the belligerent by
whom the capture was made, but not in other cases.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Grounds and Mode of Capture.</p></div>

<p>§ 429. From the statements given above in §§
368-428 regarding blockade, contraband, unneutral
service, and visitation, it is obvious that capture may
take place either because the vessel, or the cargo, or
both, are liable to confiscation, or because grave suspicion
demands a further inquiry which can be carried
out in a port only. Both cases are alike so far as all
details of capture are concerned, and in the latter case
Prize Courts may pronounce capture to be justified,
although no ground for confiscation of either vessel or
cargo, or both, has been detected.</p>

<p>The mode of capture is the same as described
above in § 184 regarding capture of enemy vessels.<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Effect of Capture of Neutral Vessels, and their Conduct to
Port.</p></div>

<p>§ 430. The effect of capture of neutral vessels is in
every way different from the effect of capture of enemy
vessels,<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a> since the purpose of capture differs in these
two cases. Capture of enemy vessels is made for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
purpose of appropriating them in the exercise of the
right of belligerents to appropriate all enemy property
found on the Open Sea or in the maritime territorial
belt of either belligerent. On the other hand, neutral
merchantmen are captured for the purpose of confiscation
of vessel or cargo, or both, as punishment for
certain special acts, the punishment to be pronounced
by a Prize Court after a thorough investigation into
all the circumstances of the special case. Therefore,
although the effect of capture of neutral vessels is that
the vessels, the individuals, and the goods thereon are
placed under the captor's authority, her officers and
crew never become prisoners of war. They are indeed
to be detained as witnesses for the trial of the vessel
and cargo, but nothing stands in the way of releasing
such of them as are not wanted for that purpose. As
regards passengers, if any, they have to be released as
soon as possible, with the exception of those enemy
persons who may be made prisoners of war.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_912_912" id="Footnote_912_912"></a><a href="#FNanchor_912_912"><span class="label">[912]</span></a> See above, § <a href="#The_effect_of_seizure185">185</a>.</p></div>

<p>Regarding the conduct of captured neutral vessels
to a port of a Prize Court, the same is valid as regards
conduct of captured enemy vessels<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> to such port.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Destruction of Neutral Prizes.</p></div>

<p>§ 431. <a name="That_as_a_rule431" id="That_as_a_rule431"></a>That as a rule captured neutral vessels
may not be sunk, burned, or otherwise destroyed has
always been universally recognised just as that captured
enemy merchantmen may not as a rule be destroyed.
But up to the time of the agreement on the Declaration
of London it was a moot question whether the destruction
of captured neutral vessels was likewise
exceptionally allowed instead of bringing them before a
Prize Court. British<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> practice did not, as regards the
neutral owner of the vessel, hold the captor justified in
destroying a vessel, however exceptional the case may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
have been, and however meritorious the destruction
of the vessel may have been from the point of view of
the Government of the captor. For this reason, should
a captor, for any motive whatever, have destroyed a
neutral prize, full indemnities had to be paid to the
owner, although, if brought into a port of a Prize Court,
condemnation of vessel and cargo would have been
pronounced beyond doubt. The rule was, that a
neutral prize must be abandoned in case it could not,
for any reason whatever, be brought to a port of a
Prize Court. But the practice of other States did not
recognise this British rule. The question became of
great importance in 1905, during the Russo-Japanese
War, when Russian cruisers sank the British vessels
<i>Knight Commander</i>, <i>Oldhamia</i>, <i>Icona</i>, <i>St. Kilda</i>, and
<i>Hipsang</i>, the German vessels <i>Thea</i>, and <i>Tetardos</i>, and
the Danish vessel <i>Princesse Marie</i>. Russia paid damages
to the owners of the vessels <i>Icona</i>, <i>St. Kilda</i>, <i>Thea</i>,
<i>Tetardos</i>, and <i>Princesse Marie</i>, because her Prize Courts
declared that the capture of these vessels was not
justified, but she refused to pay damages to the owners
of the other vessels destroyed, because her Prize Courts
considered them to have been justly captured.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_914_914" id="Footnote_914_914"></a><a href="#FNanchor_914_914"><span class="label">[914]</span></a> The <i>Actaeon</i> (1815), 2 Dodson, 48; the <i>Felicity</i> (1819),
2 Dodson, 381; the <i>Leucade</i> (1855), Spinks, 217. See Phillimore, III. §
333; Twiss, II. § 166; Hall, § 77; Holland, <i>Letters to the "Times" upon
War and Neutrality</i> (1909), pp. 140-150.</p></div>

<p>The Declaration of London proposes to settle the
matter by a compromise. Recognising that neutral
prizes may not as a rule be destroyed, and admitting
only one exception to the rule, it empowers the captor
under certain circumstances and conditions to demand
the handing over, or to proceed himself to the destruction,
of contraband carried by a neutral prize
which he is compelled to abandon.</p>

<p>The very first rule of Chapter IV. of the Declaration
of London, headed "Destruction of Neutral Prizes,"
is that of article 48, according to which, as a matter
of principle, captured neutral vessels may not be destroyed,
but must be taken into a port of a Prize Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
However, article 49 permits, as an exception to the
rule, the destruction of such a captured neutral vessel
as would herself be liable to condemnation, if the taking
of the vessel into a port of a Prize Court would involve
danger to the safety of the capturing cruiser, or to the
success of the operations in which she is at the time
of capture engaged.</p>

<p>There is, therefore, no doubt that a neutral prize
may no longer be destroyed because the captor cannot
spare a prize crew or because a port of a Prize Court is
too far distant, or the like. The only justification for
destruction of a neutral prize is danger to the captor
or his operations at the time of capture. As regards
the degree of danger required, it cannot be denied that
the wording of article 49 does not provide any clue for a
restrictive interpretation. But considering that article
51 speaks of an "exceptional necessity," it is hoped
and to be expected that the International Prize Court
would give such an interpretation to article 49 as would
permit a resort to the sinking of neutral prizes in cases
of absolute necessity only. Be that as it may, according
to article 49 only such neutral prizes may be sunk as
would be liable to confiscation if brought before a
Prize Court. Sinking of captured neutral vessels&mdash;apart
from neutral vessels which have acquired enemy
character and may for this reason be sunk under the
same conditions as enemy vessels&mdash;is, therefore, chiefly
admitted in three<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a> cases, namely: (1) When&mdash;see
article 40 of the Declaration of London&mdash;the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
carries contraband the value of which forms more than
half the value of the cargo; (2) when a vessel has been
captured for rendering those kinds of unneutral service
which are enumerated by article 45 of the Declaration
of London; (3) when&mdash;see article 21 of the Declaration
of London&mdash;a vessel has been captured for breach of
blockade. In no case, however, in which she is not
liable to confiscation, may a neutral vessel under any
circumstances and conditions be destroyed; she must
always be abandoned if the capturing cruiser cannot
take her into a port of a Prize Court.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_915_915" id="Footnote_915_915"></a><a href="#FNanchor_915_915"><span class="label">[915]</span></a> Only such cases of possible confiscation of a neutral
vessel are mentioned in the text as are in accordance with the
Declaration of London. The practice of some States has hitherto admitted
confiscation in other cases also, for instance, in case of deficiency,
spoliation, or defacement of ship papers, and in case of double and
false papers; see above, §§ <a href="#Since_the_purpose426">426</a>-428. It will be the task of the
International Prize Court to evolve a uniform practice with regard to
such cases. Likewise the text does not enumerate the cases in which the
sinking of a neutral vessel is permissible because she previously
acquired enemy character; concerning this, see above, § <a href="#The_general_rule89">89</a>.</p></div>

<p>However this may be, when the captor feels compelled
to resort to the destruction of a neutral prize, he
must place in safety all persons found on the captured
vessel, and he must take on board all the captured ship's
papers which are relevant for the purpose of deciding
the validity of the capture (article 50). And (article 51)
if the captor fails to establish the fact before the Prize
Court that he destroyed the prize in the face of an
exceptional necessity, the owners of the vessel and
cargo must receive full compensation without any
examination of, and any regard to, the question as to
whether or no the capture itself was justifiable. Compensation
must likewise be paid in case the capture is
held by the Prize Court to be invalid, although the act
of destruction has been held to be justifiable (article 52).
And in any case, the owners of neutral goods not liable
to condemnation which have been destroyed with the
vessel, may always and under all circumstances and
conditions claim damages (article 53).</p>

<p>Thus many safeguards have been established against
arbitrariness in resorting to the destruction of neutral
prizes. On the other hand, it would seem to be going
too far to insist on the captor letting the prize go with
her contraband on board, if he be compelled to abandon
the prize. For this reason article 54 empowers the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
captor of a neutral vessel herself not liable to confiscation,
to demand the handing over, or to proceed
himself to the destruction, of any goods liable to confiscation
found on board, if the taking of the vessel
into a port of a Prize Court would involve danger to
the captor or to the success of the operations in which
he is at the time of capture engaged. Details concerning
such destruction have been given above in
§ 406<i>a</i> (2).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Ransom and Recapture of Neutral Prizes.</p></div>

<p>§ 432. Regarding ransom of captured neutral vessels,
the same is valid as regards ransom of captured enemy

<p>As regards recapture of neutral prizes,<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> the rule
ought to be that <i>ipso facto</i> by recapture the vessel
becomes free without payment of any salvage. Although
captured, she was still the property of her
neutral owners, and if condemnation had taken place
at all, it would have been a punishment, and the recapturing
belligerent has no interest whatever in the
punishment of a neutral vessel by the enemy.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_917_917" id="Footnote_917_917"></a><a href="#FNanchor_917_917"><span class="label">[917]</span></a> See Hautefeuille, III. pp. 366-406;

<p>But the matter of recapture of neutral prizes is
not settled, no rule of International Law and no uniform
practice of the several States being formulated regarding
it. Very few treaties touch upon it, and the
municipal regulations of the different States regarding
prizes seldom mention it. According to British
practice,<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> the recaptor of a neutral prize is entitled to

reason or another be brought into a port, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
cases in which they are released without a trial. The
rule is that a captured neutral vessel is to be tried by a
Prize Court in case the captor asserts her to be suspicious
or guilty. But it may happen that all suspicion is
dispelled even before the trial, and then the vessel is
to be released at once. For this reason article 246 of
Holland's <i>Prize Law</i> lays down the rule: "If, after
the detention of the vessel, there should come to the
knowledge of the commander any further acts tending
to show that the vessel has been improperly detained,
he should immediately release her...." Even after
she has been brought into the port of a Prize Court,
release can take place without a trial. Thus the
German vessels <i>Bundesrath</i> and <i>Herzog</i>, which were
captured in 1900 during the South African War and
taken to Durban, were, after search had dispelled all
suspicion, released without trial.</p>

<p>That the released vessel may claim damages is a
matter of course, and article 64 of the Declaration of
London precisely enacts it. But it should be mentioned
that, since Convention XII. stipulates only
appeals against judgments of National Prize Courts,
the International Prize Court would not have jurisdiction
in a case of the release of a vessel without trial,
and that the question of compensation could, therefore,
be settled through the diplomatic channel only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 434. <a name="Although_belligerents434" id="Although_belligerents434"></a>Although belligerents have, under certain
circumstances, according to International Law, the
right to capture neutral vessels, and although they have
the duty to bring these vessels for trial before a Prize
Court, such trials are in no way an international matter.
Just as Prize Courts&mdash;apart from the proposed International
Prize Court&mdash;are municipal<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> institutions, so
trials of captured neutral vessels by these Prize Courts
are municipal matters. The neutral home States of
the vessels are not represented and, directly at any
rate, not concerned in the trial. Nor is, as commonly
maintained, the law administered by Prize Courts
International Law. These Courts apply the law of
their country. The best proof of this is the fact that
the practice of the Prize Courts of the several countries
has hitherto differed in many points. Thus, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
the question what is and what is not contraband,
and, further, the question when an attempt to break
blockade begins and when it ends, have hitherto
been differently answered by the practice of different
States.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_919_919" id="Footnote_919_919"></a><a href="#FNanchor_919_919"><span class="label">[919]</span></a> See above, § <a href="#It_has_already192">192</a>. The matter is regulated so far as Great
Britain is concerned by the Naval Prize Act, 1864 (27 and 28 Vict. ch.
25) and the Prize Courts Act, 1894 (57 and 58 Vict. ch. 39). The
<i>Règlement international des prises maritimes</i>, adopted in 1887 at
Heidelberg by the Institute of International Law, provides in §§ 63-118
detailed rules concerning the organisation of Prize Courts and the
procedure before them; see <i>Annuaire</i>, IX. (1888), p. 208.</p></div>

<p>Many writers, however, maintain that Prize Courts
are International Courts, and that the law administered
by these courts is International Law. Lord Stowell
again and again<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> emphatically asserted it, and the
vast majority of English and American writers<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> follow
him. But it is to be expected that the recognition
of the difference between Municipal and International
Law, as expounded
 above, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41046/41046-h/41046-h.htm#Th20">Vol. I., §§ 20</a>-25, and of the
fact that States only, and neither their Courts nor
officials nor citizens, are subjects of International
Law, will lead to the general recognition of the fact
that the law applied by National Prize Courts is
not and cannot be International Law.</p>

<i>Conferences</i>, p. 467, distinctly agree with me.</p></div>

<p>And matters will remain as they are even after
the establishment of the International Prize Court
and ratification of the Declaration of London. The
law of this Declaration is certainly International Law,
but it will be binding only upon the States, and they,
on their part, must embody it in their Municipal Law
so that their Prize Courts are obliged to administer such
a law in prize cases as is in conformity with the Declaration
of London. It will be the task of the International
Prize Court<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a> to control the National Prize
Courts in that direction. A State which is a party to
the Declaration and would nevertheless order its Prize
Courts to apply a law which is in opposition to the
Declaration of London, would commit an international<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
delinquency, but its Prize Courts would be obliged to
apply such law.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_922_922" id="Footnote_922_922"></a><a href="#FNanchor_922_922"><span class="label">[922]</span></a> Trial before this Court is, of course, an international

<div class="sidenote"><p>Result of Trial.</p></div>

<p>§ 435. The trial of a captured neutral ship can
have one or more of five results:&mdash;vessel and cargo
can be condemned,<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> or the vessel alone, or the cargo
alone; and the vessel and cargo can be released
either with or without costs and damages. Costs and
damages must be allowed when capture was not
justified, and, after the ratification of the Declaration
of London and the establishment of the International
Prize Court, an appeal may, according to article 64 of
the Declaration of London and article 4 of Convention
XII., be brought before the International Prize Court if
costs and damages are refused or inadequately allowed
by a Prize Court. But it must be emphasised that
capture might be justified, as, for instance, in the case
of spoliation of papers, although the Prize Court did
not condemn the vessel, and, further, that costs and
damages are never allowed in case a part only of the
cargo is condemned, although the vessel herself and the
greater part of the cargo are released. That, in case
the captor is unable to pay the costs and damages
allowed to a released neutral vessel, his Government
has to indemnify the vessel, there ought to be no doubt,
for a State bears "vicarious" responsibility<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a> for internationally
injurious acts of its naval forces.</p>

involves the loss of the vessel at the date of capture; see <i>Andersen</i>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_924_924" id="Footnote_924_924"></a><a href="#FNanchor_924_924"><span class="label">[924]</span></a> See

<div class="sidenote"><p>Trial after
Conclusion
of
Peace.</p></div>

<p>§ 436. <a name="It_is_a_moot_question436" id="It_is_a_moot_question436"></a>It is a moot question whether neutral vessels
captured before conclusion of peace may be tried after
the conclusion of peace.<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> I think that the answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
must be in the affirmative, even if a special clause is
contained in the Treaty of Peace, which stipulates that
captured but not yet condemned vessels of the belligerents
shall be released. A trial of neutral prizes is in
any case necessary for the purpose of deciding the
question whether capture was justified or not, and
whether, should condemnation not be justified, the
neutral vessels may claim costs and indemnities.
Thus, after the conclusion of the Abyssinian War, in
December 1896, the Italian Prize Commission, in the
case of the <i>Doelwijk</i>,<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> claimed the right to try the vessel
in spite of the fact that peace had been concluded
between the time of capture and trial, declared the
capture of the vessel and cargo to have been justified,
but pronounced that, peace having been concluded,
confiscation of vessel and cargo would no longer be
lawful.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_925_925" id="Footnote_925_925"></a><a href="#FNanchor_925_925"><span class="label">[925]</span></a> See Perels, § 57, p. 309, in contradistinction to
Bluntschli, § 862. But there is, of course, no doubt that a belligerent
can exercise an act of grace and release such prizes. Thus, in November
1905, at the end of the Russo-Japanese War, the Mikado proclaimed the
unconditional release of all neutral prizes captured after the signing
but before the ratification of the Peace of Portsmouth. Thereby, three
German vessels, two English, and one Norwegian escaped confiscation,
which in strict law&mdash;see above, <a href="#Footnote_890_890">p. 534, note 4</a>&mdash;would have been
justified.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_926_926" id="Footnote_926_926"></a><a href="#FNanchor_926_926"><span class="label">[926]</span></a> See Martens, <i>N.R.G.</i> 2nd Ser. XXVIII. pp. 66-90.</p></div>

<p>Different from the question whether neutral prizes
may be tried after the conclusion of peace is the other
question whether they may be condemned to be confiscated.
In the above-mentioned case of the <i>Doelwijk</i>
the question was answered in the negative, but I believe
it ought to have been answered in the affirmative.
Confiscation of vessel and cargo having the character
of a punishment, it would seem that the punishment
may be inflicted after the conclusion of peace provided
the criminal act concerned was consummated before
peace was concluded. But nothing, of course, stands
in the way of a belligerent taking a more lenient view
and ordering his Prize Courts not to pronounce confiscation
of neutral vessels after the conclusion of
peace.</p>

<p>The Declaration of London does not settle either
the former or the latter question, and it would therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
be the task of the International Prize Court to evolve
a uniform practice in the cases concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Protests and Claims of Neutrals after Trial.</p></div>

<p>§ 437. <a name="Hitherto_if_a_trial437" id="Hitherto_if_a_trial437"></a>Hitherto, if a trial led to condemnation, and if
the latter was confirmed by the Court of Appeal, the
matter as between the captor and the owner of the
captured vessel and cargo was finally settled. But the
right of protection,<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> which a State exercises over its
subjects and their property abroad, may nevertheless
have been the cause of diplomatic protests and claims
on the part of the neutral home State of a condemned
vessel or cargo, in case the verdict of the Prize Courts
was considered to be not in accordance with International
Law or formally or materially unjust. It is
through such protests and claims that the matter,
which was hitherto a mere municipal one, became of
<i>international</i> importance. And history records many
instances of cases of interposition of neutral States
after trials of vessels which had sailed under their
flags. Thus, for instance, in the famous case of the
Silesian Loan,<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> it was the fact that Frederick II. of
Prussia considered the procedure of British Prize
Courts regarding a number of Prussian merchantmen
captured during war between Great Britain and France
in 1747 and 1748 as unjust, which made him in 1752
resort to reprisal and cease the payment of the interest
of the Silesian Loan. The matter was settled<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> in 1756,
through the payment of £20,000 as indemnity by
Great Britain. Thus, further, after the American
Civil War, articles 12-17 of the Treaty of Washington<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a>
provided the appointment of three Commissioners for
the purpose, amongst others, of deciding all claims
against verdicts of the American Prize Courts. And
when in 1879, during war between Peru and Chili, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
German vessel <i>Luxor</i> was condemned by the

<p>§ 438. Numerous inconveniences must naturally
result from a condition of International Law which has
hitherto prevailed and according to which the Courts
of the belligerent whose forces had captured neutral
vessels exercised jurisdiction without any control by
neutrals. Although, as shown above in § <a href="#Hitherto_if_a_trial437">437</a>, neutrals
frequently interfered after a trial and succeeded in
obtaining recognition for their claims in face of the
verdicts of Prize Courts, great dissatisfaction has long
been felt at the condition of matters hitherto obtaining,
and proposals have been made for so-called mixed
Prize Courts.</p>

<p>The first proposal of this kind was made in 1759 by
Hübner,<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> who suggested a Prize Court composed of
judges nominated by the belligerent and of consuls or
councillors nominated by the home State of the captured
neutral merchantmen.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_932_932" id="Footnote_932_932"></a><a href="#FNanchor_932_932"><span class="label">[932]</span></a> <i>De la saisie des bâtiments neutres</i> (1759), vol. II. p. 21.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span></p></div>

<p>A somewhat similar proposal was made by Tetens<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a>
in 1805.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_933_933" id="Footnote_933_933"></a><a href="#FNanchor_933_933"><span class="label">[933]</span></a> <i>Considérations sur les droits réciproques des puissances
belligérantes et des puissances neutres sur mer, avec les principes du
droit de guerre en général</i> (1805), p. 163.</p></div>

<p>Other proposals followed until the Institute of International
Law took up the matter in 1875, appointing,
on the suggestion of Westlake, at its meeting at the
Hague, a Commission for the purpose of drafting a
<i>Projet d'organisation d'un tribunal international des
prises maritimes</i>. In the course of time there were
mainly two proposals before the Institute, Westlake's
and Bulmerincq's.</p>

<p>Westlake proposed<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> that Courts of Appeal should
be instituted in each case of war, and each Court should
consist of three judges&mdash;one to be nominated by the
belligerent concerned, another by the home State of
the neutral prizes concerned, and the third by a neutral
Power not interested in the case. According to Westlake's
proposal there would therefore have to be instituted
in every war as many Courts of Appeal as
neutrals concerned.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_934_934" id="Footnote_934_934"></a><a href="#FNanchor_934_934"><span class="label">[934]</span></a> See <i>Annuaire</i>, II. (1878), p. 114.</p></div>

<p>Bulmerincq proposed<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> that two Courts should be
instituted in each war for all prize cases, the one to act
as Prize Court of the First Instance, the other to act as
Prize Court of Appeal; each Court to consist of three
judges, one judge to be appointed by each belligerent,
the third judge to be appointed in common by all
neutral maritime Powers.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_935_935" id="Footnote_935_935"></a><a href="#FNanchor_935_935"><span class="label">[935]</span></a> See
 <i>R.I.</i> XI. (1879), pp. 191-194.</p></div>

<p>Finally, the Institute agreed, at its meeting at
Heidelberg in 1887, upon the following proposal,
which is embodied in §§ 100-109 of the <i>Règlement
international des prises maritimes</i>:<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a>&mdash;At the beginning
of a war each belligerent institutes a Court of Appeal
consisting of five judges, the president and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
other judges to be appointed by the belligerent, the three
remaining to be nominated by three neutral Powers,

<p>No further step was taken in the matter during the
nineteenth century. But, during the South African
War, the conviction became general that the exclusive
jurisdiction of belligerents over captured neutral vessels
is incompatible with the modern condition of the oversea
commerce of neutrals. At the Second Peace
Conference of 1907, therefore, Germany, as well as
Great Britain, brought forward a project for real International
Prize Courts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>German
Project of
1907.</p></div>

<p>§ 439. The German project<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> was embodied in a
draft of thirty-one articles dealing in three chapters
with "Competence in Prize Cases," "Organisation of
the International Prize Court," and "Procedure before
the International Prize Court," and made the following
proposals:&mdash;National Prize Courts should only be competent
in the first instance, every appeal to go to the
International Prize Court, and the latter to be competent
not only in case of capture of neutral vessels, but in
every case of capture of merchantmen. At the beginning
of every war an International Prize Court
should be established, but, in case there were more
than two parties to a war, as many International Prize
Courts should be established as there were couples of
States fighting against each other. Each Court every
time it sat should consist of five judges, three of whom
should be members of the Permanent Court of Arbitration
at the Hague, and two should be admirals. The
admirals should belong to the navies of the belligerents,
but the three members of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration should be chosen by neutral Powers, each
belligerent authorising one neutral Power to select one
member, and these two neutrals to appoint a third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
neutral Power which would select the third member.
The Court should sit at the Hague, have its first meeting
when the first appeal case arose, and be dissolved after
the conclusion of peace. The International Bureau of
the Permanent Court of Arbitration should serve as
the Registry of every International Prize Court. Each
belligerent and the owners of the captured vessels or
cargoes should have the right to bring an appeal before
the International Prize Court.</p>

of sixteen articles, and made the following proposals:&mdash;The
International Prize Court should be competent in
such cases only as directly concerned a neutral Power
or its subjects, an appeal to be brought before the
International Court only after the case had been decided
by the highest National Prize Court of the belligerent
concerned. Neutral Powers only, and not their subjects,
should have the right to enter an appeal, and each
neutral Power should represent its subjects concerned
in a prize case. In contradistinction to the German
project, the British draft proposed the establishment
once for all of a Permanent International Prize Court,
each Power whose mercantile marine at the date of
the signature of the proposed convention exceeded a
total of 800,000 tons, should, within three months from
the date of ratification, nominate a prominent jurist as
a member of the Court, and another as his deputy.
The President of the Court should be nominated by the
signatory Powers in their alphabetical order, should
remain in office one year only, and should have a casting
vote. If a legal question were to be decided which had
already been provided for in a convention between
the parties in dispute, the Court should base its decision
on such convention. In the absence of such a convention,
and if all civilised nations were agreed on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
point of legal interest, the Court should base its decision
thereon, otherwise the Court should decide according
to the principles of International Law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Convention
XII.
of the
Second
Peace
Conference.</p></div>

<p>§ 441. The Second Peace Conference, after having
studied and discussed the German and the British
projects, produced the "Convention (XII.) respecting
the establishment of an International Prize Court"
which, on the whole, follows more closely the lines of
the British project, but includes several features of the
German, and others which originate neither with the
British nor the German project. It comprises fifty-seven
articles and is divided into four parts headed
respectively "General Provisions" (articles 1-9), "Constitution
of the International Prize Court" (articles
10-27), "Procedure in the International Prize Court"
(articles 28-50), and "Final Provisions" (articles 51-57).
The Convention was signed by all the Powers represented
at the Conference, except Brazil, China, Domingo,
Greece, Luxemburg, Montenegro, Nicaragua, Roumania,
Russia, Servia, and Venezuela. Ten States&mdash;namely,
Chili, Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Persia, Salvador,
Siam, Turkey, and Uruguay&mdash;entered a reservation
against article 15 of the Convention because they did
not agree with the principle of the composition of the
Court embodied in this article.</p>

<p>As eleven States did not sign the Convention and
ten of the signatory States refused to accept the composition
of the Court as regulated by article 15, it
cannot be said that the Convention is based on universal
agreement. Yet the fact that, with the exception of
Russia, all the Great Powers and a great number of the
minor Powers have signed it without a reservation,
offers sufficient guarantee for the success of the Court
when once established. Nothing prevents a future
Peace Conference from making such alterations in the
Convention as would meet the wishes of the Powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
which at present refuse to sign the Convention or to
accept article 15.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that, according to article 55,
the Convention remains in force for twelve years from
the date it comes into force, and is to be tacitly renewed
for six years, unless denounced one year at least before
the expiry of the period for which it is in force. And
article 57 stipulates that two years before the expiration
of the period for which it is in force, any contracting
Power may demand a modification of the provisions
concerning its own participation in the composition of
the Court. The demand must be addressed to the
Administrative Council which, on its part, must examine
it and submit proposals as to the measures to be
adopted to all the contracting Powers. These Powers
must, with the least possible delay, inform the Administrative
Council of their decision. The result is
at once, or at any rate one year and thirty days before
the expiry of the period of two years, to be communicated
to the Power which made the demand for a
modification of the provisions concerning its participation
in the composition of the Court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span></p>

<p>§ 442. <a name="The_International_Prize442" id="The_International_Prize442"></a>The International Prize Court consists of
judges and deputy judges, a judge who is absent or
prevented from sitting being replaced by a deputy
(article 14). The judges and the deputies are appointed
by the contracting Powers from among jurists
of known proficiency in maritime International Law, and
of the highest moral reputation, each Power appointing
one judge and one deputy for a period of six years
(articles 10 and 11). The judges are all of equal rank
and have precedence according to the date of the
notification of their appointment to the Administrative
Council of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the
Hague, but, if they sit by rota in conformity with
article 15, paragraph 2, they have precedence according
to the date on which they entered upon their duties,
and, when the date is the same, the senior takes precedence;
deputies rank after the judges (article 12).
The judges&mdash;and the deputies when taking the places
of judges&mdash;must, when outside their own country, be
granted diplomatic privileges and immunities in the
performance of their duties; they must, before taking
their seats, take an oath, or make a solemn affirmation,
before the Administrative Council, that they will discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
their duties impartially and conscientiously
(article 13). No judge or deputy judge may, during
the tenure of his office, appear as agent or advocate
before the International Prize Court, nor act for one
of the parties in any capacity whatever (article 17).</p>

<p>Attention should be drawn to the fact that the
Court, if once established, will be permanent, and the
judges, if once appointed, will always be at hand,
although in time of peace they will not sit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Deciding
Tribunal.</p></div>

<p>§ 443. The judges appointed by the contracting
Powers do not, as a body, decide the appeal cases brought
before the Court. From among the great number of
judges appointed, a deciding tribunal is formed which
is composed of fifteen judges, nine of whom constitute
a quorum; and a judge who is absent or prevented
from sitting is replaced by a deputy (article 14). The
judges appointed by Great Britain, Germany, the
United States of America, Austria-Hungary, France,
Italy, Japan, and Russia are always summoned to
sit, but the judges appointed by the remaining contracting
Powers are only in rotation summoned to sit,
and their duties may successively be performed by the
same person, since the same individual may be appointed
as judge by several of these Powers (article 15).
If a belligerent Power has, according to the rota, no
judge sitting in the deciding tribunal, it has a right to
demand that the judge appointed by it shall take part
in the settlement of all cases arising from the war,
and lots shall then be drawn to decide which of the
judges entitled to sit by rota shall withdraw, but the
judge of the other belligerent party does not take part
in the drawing of lots (article 16). No judge may sit
who has been a party, in any way whatever, to the
sentence pronounced by the National Prize Court
against which the appeal has been made, or who has
taken part in the case as counsel or advocate for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
of the parties (article 17). The summoning by rota
of the judges appointed by the minor Powers takes
place according to the following list:&mdash;</p>

<p>The deciding tribunal elects its President and Vice-President
by an absolute majority of the votes cast, but
after two ballots the election is made by a bare majority,
and, in case the votes are equal, by lot (article 19).</p>

<p>The judges&mdash;as well as the deputies when they sit&mdash;receive,
while carrying out their duties, a salary of
one hundred Netherland florins (about £8, 4s.) <i>per diem</i>,
besides travelling expenses. The salaries and travelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
expenses are to be paid by the International Bureau of
the Permanent Court of Arbitration, and the judges
must not receive any other remuneration either from
their own Government or from any other Power
(article 20).</p>

<p>The belligerent captor, as well as a neutral Power
which is herself, or whose national is, a party, may
appoint a naval officer of high rank to sit as <i>Assessor</i>,
but he has no voice in the decision. If more than one
neutral Power is concerned in a case, they must agree
among themselves, if necessary by lot, on the naval
officer to be appointed as Assessor (article 18).</p>

<p>The seat<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> of the deciding tribunal is at the Hague,
and it may not, except in the case of <i>force majeure</i>,
be transferred elsewhere without the consent of both
belligerents (article 21). When the Court is not sitting,
the duties conferred on it by certain articles of Convention
XII. are discharged by a delegation of three
judges appointed by the Court; this delegation comes
to a decision by a majority of votes, and its members
must, of course, reside at the Hague while they fulfil
their duties (article 48).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_939_939" id="Footnote_939_939"></a><a href="#FNanchor_939_939"><span class="label">[939]</span></a> The working-order (<i>ordre intérieur</i>) of the International
Prize Court is to be drawn up by the Court itself; see details in
article 49.</p></div>

<p>The deciding tribunal determines what language it
will itself use and what languages may be used before
it, but in all cases the official language of the National
Courts which have had cognisance of the case may be
used before it (article 24).</p>

<p>For all notices to be served, in particular on the
parties, witnesses, or experts, the deciding tribunal
may apply direct to the Government of the State on
whose territory the service is to be carried out. The
same rule applies in the case of steps to be taken to
procure evidence. The Court is equally entitled to
act through the Power on whose territory it holds its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>

who are parties to Convention XII. shall be members
of it (article 22).</p>

<p>The International Bureau of the Permanent Court
of Arbitration acts as Registry of the International

the archives and carries out the administrative work,
and its General Secretary acts as Registrar of the

<p>Private individuals concerned in a case are compelled
to be represented before the Court by an Attorney,
who must either be an Advocate qualified to plead before
a Court of Appeal or a High Court of one of the contracting

higher teaching centres of those countries (article 26).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Competence.</p></div>

<p>§ 446. The general principle underlying the rules of
Convention XII. concerning the competence of the
International Prize Court is that on the whole, <i>although
not exclusively</i>, the Court is competent in cases where
neutrals are directly or indirectly concerned. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
International Prize Court is, as a rule, a Court of Appeal,
all prize cases must, in the first instance, be decided by
a National Prize Court of the captor, although the
Municipal Law of the country concerned may provide
that a first appeal must likewise be decided by a
National Prize Court. The second appeal may never
by decided by a National, but must always be decided
by the International Prize Court. However, should the
National Court of the First Instance or the National
Court of Appeal fail to give final judgment within two
years from the date of capture, the case may be
carried direct to the International Prize Court (articles
2 and 6).</p>

<p>An appeal against the judgments of National Prize
Courts may be brought before the International Court:
(1) when the judgment concerns the property of a
neutral Power or a neutral individual;<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> (2) when the
judgment concerns enemy property and relates to (<i>a</i>)
cargo on board a neutral vessel, (<i>b</i>) an enemy vessel
captured in the territorial waters of a neutral Power,
provided such Power has not made the capture the
subject of diplomatic claim, and (<i>c</i>) a claim based upon
the allegation that the seizure has been effected in
violation, either of the provisions of a convention in
force between the belligerent Powers, or of an enactment
issued by the belligerent captor. In any case,
the appeal may be based on the ground that the judgment
was wrong either in fact or in law (article 3).</p>

to bring an appeal before the International Prize

<p>(1) Neutral Powers, if the judgment injuriously
affects their property or the property of their subjects,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
or if the capture is alleged to have taken place in the
territorial waters of such Powers (article 4, No. 1).</p>

<p>(2) Neutral individuals,<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> if the judgment injuriously

or itself undertake the proceedings in his place (article 4,
No. 2).</p>

<p>(3) Subjects of the enemy, if the judgment injuriously
affects their cargoes on neutral vessels, or if
it injuriously affects their property in case the seizure
is alleged to have been effected in violation, either of
the provisions of a convention in force between the
belligerent Powers, or of an enactment issued by the
belligerent captor (article 4, No. 3).</p>

<p>(4) Subjects of neutral Powers or of the enemy
deriving rights from the rights of such individuals as
are themselves qualified to bring an appeal before the
International Prize Court, provided they have intervened
in the proceedings of the National Court or
Courts concerned. Individuals so entitled may appeal
separately to the extent of their interests (article 5, first
paragraph).</p>

<p>(5) Subjects of neutral Powers or of the enemy
deriving rights from the rights of a neutral Power whose

<div class="sidenote"><p>What
Law to be
applied.</p></div>

<p>§ 447. As regards the law to be applied by the
International Prize Court, article 7 of Convention XII.
contains the following provisions and distinctions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) If a question of law to be decided be covered by
a treaty in force between the belligerent captor and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
Power which is itself, or whose subject is, a party to
the proceedings, the Court must apply the provisions
of such treaty.</p>

<p>(2) In absence of such provisions, the Court must
apply the rules of International Law.</p>

<p>(3) If there be no generally recognised rules of
International Law which could be applied, the Court
must base its decision on the general principles of
justice and equity.</p>

<p>(4) If&mdash;see article 3, No. 2 (<i>c</i>) of Convention XII.&mdash;the
ground of appeal be the violation of an enactment
issued by the belligerent captor, the Court must apply
such enactment.</p>

<p>(5) The Court is empowered to disregard failure,
on the part of an appellant, to comply with the procedure
laid down by the Municipal Law of the belligerent
captor, if it is of opinion that the consequences of such
Municipal Law are unjust or inequitable.</p>

<p>The very wide powers of the International Prize
Court with regard to the law to be applied by it, have
been considerably narrowed down by the fact that the
Declaration of London provides a code of Prize Law,
which in time will be universally accepted, but those
powers are still very wide.</p>


<h4>
<span class="larger">III</span>
<span class="smaller">PROCEDURE IN THE INTERNATIONAL PRIZE COURT</span>
</h4>


<p class="indh1">See the literature quoted above at the commencement of § <a href="#The_International_Prize442">442</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Entering
of Appeal.</p></div>

<p>§ 448. As a rule there are two ways of entering an
appeal against the judgment of a National Prize Court,
namely, either by a written declaration made in the
National Court against whose judgment the appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
is directed, or by a written or telegraphic declaration
addressed to the International Bureau. In either case
the appeal must be entered within one hundred and
twenty days from the day the judgment was delivered
or notified (article 28). But the appeal must be addressed
to the International Bureau only, if a party
intends to carry a case direct to the International Prize
Court on account of the National Courts having failed
to give final judgment within two years from the date
of capture, and in such case the appeal must be entered
within thirty days from the expiry of the period of
two years (article 30).</p>

<p>If the appeal has been entered in the National Court,
this Court must, without considering the question as
to whether the appeal was entered in time, transmit
within seven days the record of the case to the International
Bureau. On the other hand, if the declaration
of appeal has been sent to the International Bureau,
this Bureau must immediately, if possible by telegraph,
send information to the National Court concerned
which must within seven days transmit the record of
the case to the Bureau. And should the appeal be
entered by a neutral individual, the International
Bureau must immediately by telegraph inform the
Government of the respective individual in order to
enable such Government to come to a decision as to
whether it will&mdash;see article 4, No. 2&mdash;prevent the individual
from going on with the appeal, or will undertake
proceedings in his stead (article 29).</p>

<p>If the appeal has not been entered in time, the
Court must reject it without discussion of the merits
of the case. But the Court may grant relief from the
effect of this rule and admit the appeal, if the appellant
is able to show that he was prevented by <i>force majeure</i>
from entering the appeal in time, and that he has
entered the appeal within sixty days after the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
which prevented him from entering it earlier
ceased to operate (article 31).</p>

<p>If the appeal has been entered in time, a certified
copy of the notice of appeal must officially be transmitted
to the respondent by the Court; if the Court
is not sitting, its delegation of three judges must act
for it (articles 32 and 48). If in addition to the parties
who are before the Court through an appeal having
been entered, there are other parties concerned who are
entitled to appeal, or if in the case referred to in article
29, third paragraph, the Government which has received
notice of an appeal has not announced its decision,
the Court may not deal with the case until either
the period of one hundred and twenty days from the
day the judgment of the National Prize Court has been
delivered or notified, or the period of thirty days from
the expiry of two years from the date of capture has
expired (article 31).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Pleadings
and Discussion.</p></div>

<p>§ 449. The procedure, which follows the entry of an
appeal and the preliminary steps in consequence thereof,
comprises two distinct phases, namely, written pleadings
and oral discussion.</p>

<p>(1) The written <i>pleadings</i> consist of the deposit and
exchange of cases, counter-cases, and, if necessary, of
replies, the order of which, as also the periods within
which they must be delivered, must be fixed by the
Court or its delegation of three judges (article 48), and
to which all papers and documents the parties intend
to make use of must be annexed. The Court must
communicate a certified copy of every document produced
by one party to the other party (article 34).</p>

<p>(2) After the close of the pleadings the Court must
fix a day for a public sitting on which the <i>discussion</i> is
to take place (article 35). The discussion is under the
direction of the President or Vice-President, or, in
case both of these are absent or cannot act, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
senior judge present; but the judge appointed by a
belligerent party may never preside (article 38). The
discussion takes place with open doors, but a Government
which is a party may demand that the discussion
take place with closed doors. In any case minutes
must be taken and must be signed by the President
and Registrar, and these minutes alone have an
authentic character (article 39). During the discussion
the parties state their views of the case both as to the
law and as to the facts, but the Court may at any stage
suspend the speeches of counsel in order that supplementary
evidence may be obtained (article 35). The
Court may order the supplementary evidence to be
taken, either in the manner provided for by article 27,
or before itself, or before one or more members of the
Court provided it can be done without compulsion or
intimidation; if steps are taken by members of the
Court outside the territory where it is sitting, the
consent of the foreign Government must be obtained
(article 36). The parties must be summoned to take
part in all stages of the taking of supplementary
evidence, and they must receive certified copies of the
minutes (article 37). If a party does not appear in
spite of having been duly summoned, or if a party fails
to comply with some step within the period fixed by
the Court, the case proceeds without that party and
the Court makes its decision on the basis of the material
at its disposal, but the Court must officially notify to
the parties all decisions or orders made in their absence
(article 40).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Judgment.</p></div>

<p>§ 450. After the discussion follows the judgment of
the Court.</p>

<p>The deliberation of the Court in order to agree upon
the judgment takes place in private and must remain
secret. The Court must take into consideration all
the documents, evidence, and oral statements. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
questions are decided by a majority of the judges
present; if the number of the judges is even and is
equally divided, the vote of the junior judge in the
order of precedence is not counted (articles 42 and 43).
The judgment must be taken down in writing, state the
reasons upon which it is based, give the names of the
judges taking part in it and of the assessors, if any,
and must be signed by the President and Registrar.</p>

<p>The pronouncement of the judgment of the Court
takes place in public, the parties being present or
having been duly summoned to attend. The judgment
must be officially communicated to the parties. After
this communication has been made, the Court must
transmit to the National Prize Court concerned the
record of the case, together with copies of the various
decisions arrived at and of the minutes of the proceedings
(article 45).</p>

<p>If the Court pronounces the capture of a vessel or
cargo to be valid, they may be disposed of in accordance
with the Municipal Law of the belligerent captor.
If the Court pronounces the capture to be invalid,
restitution of the vessel or cargo must be ordered, and
the amount of damages, if any, must be fixed, especially
in case the vessel or cargo has been sold or destroyed.
If the National Prize Court has already declared the
capture to be invalid, the International Prize Court
must decide on an appeal concerning the damages due
to the owner of the captured vessel or cargo (article 8).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Expenses
and Costs.</p></div>

<p>§ 451. The <i>general expenses</i> of the International
Prize Court are borne by the contracting Powers in
proportion to their share in the composition of the
Court as laid down in article 15 of Convention XII.;
the appointment of deputy judges does not involve
any contribution (article 47).</p>

<p>As regards <i>costs</i>, each party pays its own, but the
party against whom the Court has given its decision,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
must bear the costs of the trial and, in addition, must
pay one per cent. of the value of the subject matter
of the case as a contribution to the general expenses
of the International Prize Court. The amount of the
payments must be fixed in the judgment of the Court
(article 46, first and second paragraphs). If the appeal
is brought by an individual, he must, after having
entered the appeal, furnish the International Bureau
with security to an amount fixed by the Court or&mdash;see
article 48&mdash;by its delegation (article 46, third paragraph).</p>



<h4>
<span class="larger">IV</span>
<span class="smaller">ACTION IN DAMAGES INSTEAD OF APPEAL</span>
</h4>


<p class="indh1">Scott in <i>A.J.</i> V. (1911), pp. 302-324.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p>Reason for Action in Damages instead of Appeal.</p></div>

<p>§ 452. According to the Constitution of the United
States of America, and probably that of some other
States, no appeal may be brought against a judgment
of their Highest Courts. These States could not,
therefore, ratify Convention XII. and take part in the
establishment of the International Prize Court without
previously having altered their Constitution. As such
alteration would be a very complicated and precarious
matter, the Naval Conference of London of 1908-9
included in the Final Protocol of the Conference the
following <i>v&oelig;u</i>:&mdash;"The Delegates of the Powers represented
at the Naval Conference and which have signed
or have expressed their intention to sign the Hague
Convention of October 18, 1907, concerning the establishment
of an International Prize Court, considering
the constitutional difficulties which, in certain States,
stand in the way of the ratification of that Convention
in its actual form, agree to call the attention of their
Governments to the advantage of concluding an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
arrangement according to which the said States would, in
depositing their ratifications, have the power to add
thereto a reservation to the effect that the right of recourse
to the International Prize Court in connection
with decisions of their National Courts, shall take the
form of a direct action for damages, provided, however,
that the effect of this reservation shall not be such as
to impair the rights guaranteed by the said Convention
to private individuals as well as to Governments, and
that the terms of the reservation shall form the subject
of a subsequent understanding between the signatory
Powers of the same Convention."</p>

<p>To carry out this recommendation, Great Britain,
Germany, the United States of America, Argentina,
Austria-Hungary, Chili, Denmark, Spain, France, Japan,
Norway, Holland, and Sweden signed on September 19,
1910, at the Hague the "Additional Protocol to the
Convention relative to the establishment of an International
Prize Court" which comprises nine articles,
is (article 8) considered to be an integral part of that
Convention, and which will be ratified at the same time
as the Convention, accession to the Convention being
subordinated (article 9) to accession to the Protocol.<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a></p>


<div class="footnote"><p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_943_943" id="Footnote_943_943"></a><a href="#FNanchor_943_943"><span class="label">[943]</span></a> There is no doubt that, should
the International Prize Court be
established, all the contracting
Powers of Convention XII. would
accede to this additional protocol.</p></div>


<div class="sidenote"><p>Procedure
if Action
for
Damages
is brought.</p></div>

<p>§ 453. According to article 1 of the Protocol, those
signatory or acceding Powers of Convention XII.
which are prevented by difficulties of a constitutional
nature from accepting the Convention in its unaltered
form, have, in ratifying the Convention or acceding to
it, the right to declare that in prize cases over which
their National Courts have jurisdiction, recourse to the
International Prize Court may only be had in the form
of an action in damages for the injury caused by the
capture. In consequence thereof the procedure in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
International Prize Court, as described above, §§ 448-451,
takes place with the following modifications:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The action for damages may only be brought
before the International Prize Court by means of a
written or telegraphic declaration addressed to the
International Bureau (article 5). This Bureau must
directly notify, if possible by telegraph, the Government
of the belligerent captor, which, without considering
whether the prescribed periods of time have been
observed, must within seven days of the receipt of
the notification, transmit to the International Bureau
the case and a certified copy of the decision, if any,
rendered by the National Prize Court (article 6).</p>

<p>(2) The International Prize Court does not, as in
Appeal Cases, pronounce upon the validity or nullity
of the capture concerned, nor confirm or reverse the
judgment of the National Prize Court, but simply fixes
the amount of damages to be allowed, if any, to the
plaintiff, if the capture is considered to be illegal
(article 3).</p>

<p>(3) After having delivered judgment, the International
Prize Court does not transmit the record of
the case, the various decisions arrived at, and the
minutes, to the National Prize Court, but directly to
the Government of the belligerent captor (article 7).</p>

<p>Les Plénipotentiaires qui ont signé
le Traité de Paris du trente mars, mil
huit cent cinquante-six, réunis en Conférence,&mdash;</p>

<p>Considérant:</p>

<p>Que le droit maritime, en temps de
guerre, a été pendant longtemps l'objet
de contestations regrettables;</p>

<p>Que l'incertitude du droit et des devoirs
en pareille matière, donne lieu,
entre les neutres et les belligérants, à
des divergences d'opinion qui peuvent
faire naître des difficultés sérieuses et
même des conflits;</p>

<p>Qu'il y a avantage, par conséquent, à
établir une doctrine uniforme sur un
point aussi important;</p>

<p>Que les Plénipotentiaires assemblés
au Congrès de Paris ne sauraient mieux
répondre aux intentions, dont leurs
Gouvernements sont animés, qu'en
cherchant à introduire dans les rapports
internationaux des principes fixes
à cet égard;</p>

<p>Dûment autorisés, les susdits Plénipotentiaires
sont convenus de se concerter
sur les moyens d'atteindre ce
but; et étant tombés d'accord ont
arrêté la Déclaration solennelle ci-après:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. La course est et demeure abolie;</p>

<p>2. Le pavillon neutre couvre la marchandise
ennemie, à l'exception de la
contrebande de guerre;</p>

<p>3. La marchandise neutre, à l'exception
de la contrebande de guerre,
n'est pas saisissable sous pavillon
ennemi;</p>

<p>4. Les blocus, pour être obligatoires,
doivent être effectifs, c'est-à-dire, maintenus
par une force suffisante pour interdire
réellement l'accès du littoral de
l'ennemi.</p>

<p>Les Gouvernements des Plénipotentiaires

cette Déclaration à la connaissance des
États, qui n'ont pas été appelés à participer
au Congrès de Paris, et à les
inviter à y accéder.</p>

<p>Convaincus qui les maximes qu'ils
viennent de proclamer ne sauraient
être accueillies qu'avec gratitude par

efforts de leurs Gouvernements pour
en généraliser l'adoption ne soient

<p>Sur la proposition du Cabinet Impérial
de Russie, une Commission Militaire
Internationale ayant été réunie à
Saint-Pétersbourg, afin d'examiner la
convenance d'interdire l'usage de certains
projectiles en temps de guerre
entre les nations civilisées, et cette
Commission ayant fixé d'un commun
accord les limites techniques où les
nécessités de la guerre doivent s'arrêter
devant les exigences de l'humanité, les
Soussignés sont autorisés par les ordres
de leurs Gouvernements à déclarer ce
qui suit:</p>

<p>Considérant que les progrès de la
civilisation doivent avoir pour effet
d'atténuer autant que possible les
calamités de la guerre;</p>

<p>Que le seul but légitime que les États
doivent se proposer durant la guerre
est l'affaiblissement des forces militaires
de l'ennemi;</p>

<p>Qu'à cet effet, il suffit de mettre hors
de combat le plus grand nombre d'hommes
possible;</p>

<p>Que ce but serait dépassé par l'emploi
d'armes qui aggraveraient inutilement
les souffrances des hommes mis hors de
combat, ou rendraient leur mort inévitable;</p>

<p>Que l'emploi de pareilles armes serait
dès lors contraire aux lois de l'humanité;</p>

<p>Les Parties Contractantes s'engagent
à renoncer mutuellement, en cas de
guerre entre elles, à l'emploi par leurs
troupes de terre ou de mer, de tout
projectile d'un poids inférieur à 400
grammes, qui serait ou explosible ou
chargé de matières fulminantes ou
inflammables.</p>

<p>Elles inviteront tous les États, qui
n'ont pas participé par l'envoi de Délégués
aux délibérations de la Commission
Militaire Internationale réunie à
Saint-Pétersbourg, à accéder au présent
engagement.</p>

<p>Cet engagement n'est obligatoire que
pour les Parties Contractantes ou
Accédantes en cas de guerre entre
deux ou plusieurs d'entre elles: il
n'est pas applicable vis-à-vis de Parties
non-Contractantes ou qui n'auraient
pas accédé.</p>

<p>Il cesserait également d'être obligatoire
du moment où, dans une guerre
entre Parties Contractantes ou Accédantes,
une partie non-Contractante,
ou qui n'aurait pas accédé, se joindrait
à l'un des belligérants.</p>

<p>Les Parties Contractantes ou Accédantes
se réservent de s'entendre ultérieurement
toutes les fois qu'une proposition
précise serait formulée en vue
des perfectionnements à venir que la
science pourrait apporter dans l'armement
des troupes, afin de maintenir les
principes, qu'elles ont posés et de concilier

<span class="larger">APPENDIX V</span>
<span>GENEVA CONVENTION OF 1906</span>
</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre Premier.</span>&mdash;<i>Des Blessés
et Malades.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article premier.</p>

<p>Les militaires et les autres personnes
officiellement attachées aux armées,
qui seront blessés ou malades, devront
être respectés et soignés, sans distinction
de nationalité, par le belligérant
qui les aura en son pouvoir.</p>

<p>Toutefois, le belligérant, obligé d'abandonner
des malades ou des blessés
à son adversaire, laissera avec eux,
autant que les circonstances militaires
le permettront, une partie de son personnel
et de son matériel sanitaires
pour contribuer à les soigner.</p>

<p class="center">Article 2.</p>

<p>Sous réserve des soins à leur fournir
en vertu de l'article précédent, les
blessés ou malades d'une armée tombés
au pouvoir de l'autre belligérant sont
prisonniers de guerre et les règles
générales du droit des gens concernant
les prisonniers leur sont applicables.</p>

<p>Cependant, les belligérants restent
libres de stipuler entre eux, à l'égard
des prisonniers blessés ou malades,
telles clauses d'exception ou de faveur
qu'ils jugeront utiles; ils auront, notamment,
la faculté de convenir:</p>

<p>De se remettre réciproquement, après
un combat, les blessés laissés sur le
champ de bataille;</p>

<p>De renvoyer dans leur pays, après
les avoir mis en état d'être transportés
ou après guérison, les blessés ou
malades qu'ils ne voudront pas garder
prisonniers;</p>

<p>De remettre à un État neutre, du
consentement de celui-ci, des blessés ou
malades de la partie adverse, à la
charge par l'État neutre de les interner
jusqu'à la fin des hostilités.</p>

<p class="center">Article 3.</p>

<p>Après chaque combat, l'occupant du
champ de bataille prendra des mesures
pour rechercher les blessés et pour les
faire protéger, ainsi que les morts,
contre le pillage et les mauvais traitements.</p>

<p>Il veillera à ce que l'inhumation ou
l'incinération des morts soit précédée
d'un examen attentif de leurs cadavres.</p>

<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p>Chaque belligérant enverra, dès qu'il
sera possible, aux autorités de leur pays
ou de leur armée les marques ou pièces
militaires d'identité trouvées sur les
morts et l'état nominatif des blessés ou
malades recueillis par lui.</p>

<p>Les belligérants se tiendront réciproquement
au courant des internements
et des mutations, ainsi que
des entrées dans les hôpitaux et des
décès survenus parmi les blessés et
malades en leur pouvoir. Ils recueilleront
tous les objets d'un usage personnel,
valeurs, lettres, etc., qui seront
trouvés sur les champs de bataille ou
délaissés par les blessés ou malades décédés
dans les établissements et formations
sanitaires, pour les faire transmettre
aux intéressés par les autorités
de leur pays.</p>

<p class="center">Article 5.</p>

<p>L'autorité militaire pourra faire appel
au zèle charitable des habitants pour
recueillir et soigner, sous son contrôle,
des blessés ou malades des armées, en
accordant aux personnes ayant répondu
à cet appel une protection spéciale et
certaines immunités.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre II.</span>&mdash;<i>Des Formations et
Établissements Sanitaires.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 6.</p>

<p>Les formations sanitaires mobiles
(c'est-à-dire celles qui sont destinées à
accompagner les armées en campagne)
et les établissements fixes du service de
santé seront respectés et protégés par
les belligérants.</p>

<p class="center">Article 7.</p>

<p>La protection due aux formations
et établissements sanitaires cesse si
l'on en use pour commettre des actes
nuisibles à l'ennemi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">Article 8.</p>

<p>Ne sont pas considérés comme étant
de nature à priver une formation ou
un établissement sanitaire de la protection
assurée par l'article 6:</p>

<p>1<span class="topnum">o</span>. Le fait que le personnel de la
formation ou de l'établissement est
armé et qu'il use de ses armes pour sa
propre défense ou celle de ses malades
et blessés;</p>

<p>2<span class="topnum">o</span>. Le fait qu'à défaut d'infirmiers
armés, la formation ou l'établissement
est gardé par un piquet ou des sentinelles
munis d'un mandat régulier;</p>

<p>3<span class="topnum">o</span>. Le fait qu'il est trouvé dans la
formation ou l'établissement des armes
et cartouches retirées aux blessés et
n'ayant pas encore été versées au service
compétent.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre III.</span>&mdash;<i>Du Personnel.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 9.</p>

<p>Le personnel exclusivement affecté
à l'enlèvement, au transport et au
traitement des blessés et des malades,
ainsi qu'à l'administration des formations
et établissements sanitaires, les
aumôniers attachés aux armées, seront
respectés et protégés en toute circonstance;
s'ils tombent entre les mains
de l'ennemi, ils ne seront pas traités
comme prisonniers de guerre.</p>

<p>Ces dispositions s'appliquent au personnel
de garde des formations et établissements
sanitaires dans le cas prévu
à l'article 8, n<span class="topnum">o</span> 2.</p>

<p class="center">Article 10.</p>

<p>Est assimilé au personnel visé à
l'article précédent le personnel des
Sociétés de secours volontaires dûment
reconnues et autorisées par leur Gouvernement,
qui sera employé dans les
formations et établissements sanitaires
des armées, sous la réserve que ledit
personnel sera soumis aux lois et règlements
militaires.</p>

<p>Chaque État doit notifier à l'autre
soit dès le temps de paix, soit à l'ouverture
ou au cours des hostilités, en tout
cas avant tout emploi effectif, les noms
des Sociétés qu'il a autorisées à prêter
leur concours, sous sa responsabilité,
au service sanitaire officiel de ses
armées.</p>

<p class="center">Article 11.</p>

<p>Une Société reconnue d'un pays
neutre ne peut prêter le concours de
ses personnels et formations sanitaires
à un belligérant qu'avec l'assentiment
préalable de son propre Gouvernement
et l'autorisation du belligérant lui-même.</p>

<p>Le belligérant qui a accepté le secours
est tenu, avant tout emploi, d'en
faire la notification à son ennemi.</p>

<p class="center">Article 12.</p>

<p>Les personnes désignées dans les
articles 9, 10 et 11 continueront, après
qu'elles seront tombées au pouvoir de
l'ennemi, à remplir leurs fonctions sous
sa direction.</p>

<p>Lorsque leur concours ne sera plus
indispensable, elles seront renvoyées à
leur armée ou à leur pays dans les délais
et suivant l'itinéraire compatibles avec
les nécessités militaires.</p>

<p>Elles emporteront, alors, les effets,
les instruments, les armes et les chevaux
qui sont leur propriété particulière.</p>

<p class="center">Article 13.</p>

<p>L'ennemi assurera au personnel visé
par l'article 9, pendant qu'il sera en
son pouvoir, les mêmes allocations et
la même solde qu'au personnel des
mêmes grades de son armée.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Du Matériel.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 14.</p>

<p>Les formations sanitaires mobiles
conserveront, si elles tombent au pouvoir
de l'ennemi, leur matériel, y compris
les attelages, quels que soient les
moyens de transport et le personnel
conducteur.</p>

<p>Toutefois, l'autorité militaire compétente
aura la faculté de s'en servir
pour les soins des blessés et malades;
la restitution du matériel aura lieu
dans les conditions prévues pour le personnel
sanitaire, et, autant que possible,
en même temps.</p>

<p class="center">Article 15.</p>

<p>Les bâtiments et le matériel des
établissements fixes demeurent soumis
aux lois de la guerre, mais ne pourront
être détournés de leur emploi, tant
qu'ils seront nécessaires aux blessés et
aux malades.</p>

<p>Toutefois, les commandants des
troupes d'opérations pourront en disposer,
en cas de nécessités militaires
importantes, en assurant au préalable
le sort des blessés et malades qui s'y
trouvent.</p>

<p class="center">Article 16.</p>

<p>Le matériel des Sociétés de secours,
admises au bénéfice de la Convention
conformément aux conditions déterminées
par celle-ci, est considéré comme
propriété privée et, comme tel, respecté
en toute circonstance, sauf le droit de
réquisition reconnu aux belligérants
selon les lois et usages de la guerre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre V.</span>&mdash;<i>Des Convois
d'Évacuation.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 17.</p>

<p>Les convois d'évacuation seront
traités comme les formations sanitaires
mobiles, sauf les dispositions spéciales
suivantes:</p>

<p>1<span class="topnum">o</span>. Le belligérant interceptant un
convoi pourra, si les nécessités militaires
l'exigent, le disloquer en se
chargeant des malades et blessés qu'il
contient.</p>

<p>2<span class="topnum">o</span>. Dans ce cas, l'obligation de renvoyer
le personnel sanitaire, prévue à
l'article 12, sera étendue à tout le personnel
militaire préposé au transport
ou à la garde du convoi et muni à cet
effet d'un mandat régulier.</p>

<p>L'obligation de rendre le matériel
sanitaire, prévue à l'article 14, s'appliquera
aux trains de chemins de fer et
bateaux de la navigation intérieure
spécialement organisés pour les évacuations,
ainsi qu'au matériel d'aménagement
des voitures, trains et bateaux
ordinaires appartenant au service de
santé.</p>

<p>Les voitures militaires, autres que
celles du service de santé, pourront
être capturées avec leurs attelages.</p>

<p>Le personnel civil et les divers moyens
de transport provenant de la
réquisition, y compris matériel de
chemin de fer et les bateaux utilisés
pour les convois, seront soumis aux
règles générales du droit des gens.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Du Signe Distinctif.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 18.</p>

<p>Par hommage pour la Suisse, le signe
héraldique de la croix rouge sur fond
blanc, formé par interversion des couleurs
fédérales, est maintenu comme
emblème et signe distinctif du service
sanitaire des armées.</p>

<p class="center">Article 19.</p>

articles 9, alinéa 1<span class="topnum">er</span>, 10 et 11 porte,
fixé au bras gauche, un brassard avec
croix rouge sur fond blanc, délivré et
timbré, par l'autorité militaire compétente,
accompagné d'un certificat
d'identité pour les personnes rattachées
au service de santé des armées et qui
n'auraient pas d'uniforme militaire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 21.</p>

<p>Le drapeau distinctif de la Convention
ne peut être arboré que sur les
formations et établissements sanitaires
qu'elle ordonne de respecter et avec le
consentement de l'autorité militaire.
Il devra être accompagné du drapeau
national du belligérant dont relève la
formation ou l'établissement.</p>

<p>Toutefois, les formations sanitaires
tombées au pouvoir de l'ennemi n'arboreront
pas d'autre drapeau que celui
de la Croix-Rouge, aussi longtemps
qu'elles se trouveront dans cette
situation.</p>

<p class="center">Article 22.</p>

<p>Les formations sanitaires des pays
neutres qui, dans les conditions prévues
par l'article 11, auraient été autorisées

drapeau national du belligérant dont
elles relèvent.</p>

<p>Les dispositions du deuxième alinéa
de l'article précédent leur sont applicables.</p>

<p class="center">Article 23.</p>

<p>L'emblème de la Croix-Rouge sur fond
blanc et les mots <i>Croix-Rouge</i> ou <i>Croix

de guerre, que pour protéger ou désigner
les formations et établissements
sanitaires, le personnel et le matériel
protégés par la Convention.</p>

l'Exécution de la Convention.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 24.</p>

<p>Les dispositions de la présente Convention
ne sont obligatoires que pour
les Puissances contractantes, en cas de
guerre entre deux ou plusieurs d'entre
elles. Ces dispositions cesseront d'être
obligatoires du moment où l'une des
Puissances belligérantes ne serait pas
signataire de la Convention.</p>

<p class="center">Article 25.</p>

<p>Les commandants en chef des armées
belligérantes auront à pourvoir

temps l'emploi, par des particuliers ou
par des sociétés autres que celles y
ayant droit en vertu de la présente
Convention, de l'emblème ou de la
dénomination de <i>Croix-Rouge</i> ou <i>Croix

commercial, par le moyen de marques
de fabrique ou de commerce.</p>

<p>L'interdiction de l'emploi de l'emblème
ou de la dénomination dont il
s'agit produira son effet à partir de
l'époque déterminée par chaque législation
et, au plus tard, cinq ans après
la mise en vigueur de la présente Convention.
Dès cette mise en vigueur,
il ne sera plus licite de prendre une
marque de fabrique ou de commerce
contraire à l'interdiction.</p>

<p class="center">Article 28.</p>

<p>Les Gouvernements signataires s'engagent

<p>Les autres Puissances pourront demander
à adhérer dans la même forme,

<h3>
<span class="larger">APPENDIX VI</span>
<span>FINAL ACT OF THE SECOND PEACE CONFERENCE</span>
<span class="smaller"><i>Signed at the Hague, October 18, 1907</i></span>
</h3>


<p>La Deuxième Conférence Internationale
de la Paix, proposée d'abord
par Monsieur le Président des États-Unis
d'Amérique, ayant été, sur l'invitation
de Sa Majesté l'Empereur de
Toutes les Russies, convoquée par Sa
Majesté la Reine des Pays-Bas, s'est
réunie le 15 juin 1907 à La Haye, dans la
Salle des Chevaliers, avec la mission de
donner un développement nouveau au
principes humanitaires qui ont servi de
base à l'&oelig;uvre de la Première Conférence
de 1899.</p>

<p>Les Puissances, dont l'énumeration
suit, ont pris part à la Conférence, pour
laquelle Elles avaient désigné les Délégués
nommés ci-après:</p>

<p>[Here follow names.]</p>

<p>Dans une série de réunions, tenues
du 15 juin au 18 octobre 1907, où les
Délégués précités ont été constamment
animés du désir de réaliser, dans la
plus large mesure possible, les vues
généreuses de l'Auguste Initiateur de
la Conférence et les intentions de leurs
Gouvernements, la Conférence a arrêté,
pour être soumis à la signature des
Plénipotentiaires, le texte des Conventions
et de la Déclaration énumérées
ci-après et annexées au présent Acte:</p>

<p>I. Convention pour le règlement
pacifique des conflits internationaux.</p>

<p>II. Convention concernant la limitation
de l'emploi de la force pour le recouvrement
de dettes contractuelles.</p>

<p>III. Convention relative à l'ouverture
des hostilités.</p>

<p>IV. Convention concernant les lois
et coutumes de la guerre sur terre.</p>

<p>V. Convention concernant les droits
et les devoirs des Puissances et des
personnes neutres en cas de guerre sur
terre.</p>

<p>VI. Convention relative au régime
des navires de commerce ennemis au
début des hostilités.</p>

<p>VII. Convention relative à la transformation
des navires de commerce en
bâtiments de guerre.</p>

<p>VIII. Convention relative à la pose
de mines sous-marines automatiques
de contact.</p>

<p>IX. Convention concernant le bombardement
par des forces navales en
temps de guerre.</p>

<p>X. Convention pour l'adaptation à
la guerre maritime des principes de la
Convention de Genève.</p>

<p>XI. Convention relative à certaines
restrictions à l'exercice du droit de
capture dans la guerre maritime.</p>

<p>XII. Convention relative à l'établissement
d'une Cour internationale des
prises.</p>

<p>XIII. Convention concernant les
droits et les devoirs des Puissances
neutres en cas de guerre maritime.</p>

<p>XIV. Déclaration relative à l'interdiction
de lancer des projectiles et des
explosifs du haut de ballons.</p>

<p>Ces Conventions et cette Déclaration
formeront autant d'actes séparés. Ces
actes porteront la date de ce jour et
pourront être signés jusqu'au 30 juin
1908 à La Haye par les Plénipotentiaires
des Puissances représentées à la
Deuxième Conférence de la Paix.</p>

<p>La Conférence, se conformant à
l'esprit d'entente et de concessions
réciproques qui est l'esprit même de
ses délibérations, a arrêté la déclaration
suivante qui, tout en réservant à
chacune des Puissances représentées le
bénéfice de ses votes, leur permet à
toutes d'affirmer les principes qu'Elles
considèrent comme unanimement reconnus:</p>

<p>Elle est unanime,</p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span>. A reconnaître le principe de
l'arbitrage obligatoire;</p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span>. A déclarer que certains différends,
et notamment ceux relatifs à
l'interprétation et à l'application des
stipulations conventionnelles internationales,
sont susceptibles d'être
soumis à l'arbitrage obligatoire sans
aucune restriction.</p>

<p>Elle est unanime enfin à proclamer
que, s'il n'a pas été donné de conclure
dès maintenant une Convention en ce
sens, les divergences d'opinion qui se
sont manifestées n'ont pas dépassé les
limites d'une controverse juridique, et
qu'en travaillant ici ensemble pendant
quatre mois, toutes les Puissances du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
monde, non seulement ont appris à se
comprendre et à se rapprocher davantage,
mais ont su dégager, au cours de
cette longue collaboration, un sentiment
très élevé du bien commun de
l'humanité.</p>

<p>En outre, la Conférence a adopté à
l'unanimité la Résolution suivante:</p>

<p>La Deuxième Conférence de la Paix
confirme la Résolution adoptée par la
Conférence de 1899 à l'égard de la
limitation des charges militaires; et,
vu que les charges militaires se sont
considérablement accrues dans presque
tous les pays depuis ladite année, la
Conférence déclare qu'il est hautement
désirable de voir les Gouvernements
reprendre l'étude sérieuse de cette
question.</p>

<p>Elle a, de plus, émis les V&oelig;ux
suivants:</p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span>. La Conférence recommande
aux Puissances signataires l'adoption
du projet ci-annexé de Convention
pour l'établissement d'une Cour
de Justice arbitrale, et sa mise en
vigueur dès qu'un accord sera intervenu
sur le choix des juges et la
constitution de la Cour.</p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span>. La Conférence émet le v&oelig;u
qu'en cas de guerre, les autorités
compétentes, civiles et militaires, se
fassent un devoir tout spécial d'assurer
et de protéger le maintien des
rapports pacifiques et notamment
des relations commerciales et industrielles
entre les populations des
États belligérants et les pays neutres.</p>

<p class="blockquot">3<span class="topnum">o</span>. La Conférence émet le v&oelig;u
que les Puissances règlent, par des
Conventions particulières, la situation,
au point de vue des charges
militaires, des étrangers établis sur
leurs territoires.</p>

<p class="blockquot">4<span class="topnum">o</span>. La Conférence émet le v&oelig;u
que l'élaboration d'un règlement
relatif aux lois et coutumes de la guerre
maritime figure au programme de la
prochaine Conférence et que, dans
tous les cas, les Puissances appliquent,
autant que possible, à la
guerre sur mer, les principes de la
Convention relative aux lois et coutumes
de la guerre sur terre.</p>

<p>Enfin, la Conférence recommande
aux Puissances la réunion d'une troisième
Conférence de la Paix qui pourrait
avoir lieu, dans une période analogue
à celle qui s'est écoulée depuis la
précédente Conférence, à une date à
fixer d'un commun accord entre les
Puissances, et elle appelle leur attention
sur la nécessité de préparer les
travaux de cette troisième Conférence
assez longtemps à l'avance pour que
ses délibérations se poursuivent avec
l'autorité et la rapidité indispensables.</p>

<p>Pour atteindre à ce but, la Conférence
estime qu'il serait très désirable
que environ deux ans avant l'époque
probable de la réunion, un Comité
préparatoire fût chargé par les Gouvernements
de recueillir les diverses
propositions à soumettre à la Conférence,
de rechercher les matières
susceptibles d'un prochain règlement
international et de préparer un programme
que les Gouvernements arrêteraient
assez tôt pour qu'il pût être
sérieusement étudié dans chaque pays.
Ce Comité serait, en outre, chargé, de
proposer un mode d'organisation et de
procédure pour la Conférence elle-même.</p>

<p>En foi de quoi, les Plénipotentiaires
ont signé le présent acte et y ont
apposé leurs cachets.</p>

<p>Fait à La Haye, le dix-huit octobre
mil neuf cent sept, en un seul exemplaire
qui sera déposé dans les archives
du Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et
dont les copies, certifiées conformes,
seront délivrées à toutes les Puissances
représentées à la Conférence.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Titre I.&mdash;Du maintien de la paix
générale.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article premier.</p>

<p>En vue de prévenir autant que possible
le recours à la force dans les rapports
entre les États, les Puissances
contractantes conviennent d'employer
tous leurs efforts pour assurer le règlement
pacifique des différends internationaux.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Titre II.&mdash;Des bons offices et de la
médiation.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 2.</p>

<p>En cas de dissentiment grave ou de
conflit, avant d'en appeler aux armes,
les Puissances contractantes conviennent
d'avoir recours, en tant que les
circonstances le permettront, aux bons
offices ou à la médiation d'une ou de
plusieurs Puissances amies.</p>

<p class="center">Article 3.</p>

<p>Indépendamment de ce recours, les
Puissances contractantes jugent utile
et désirable qu'une ou plusieurs Puissances
étrangères au conflit offrent de
leur propre initiative, en tant que les
circonstances s'y prêtent, leurs bons
offices ou leur médiation aux Etats en
conflit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span></p>

<p>Le droit d'offrir les bons offices ou la
médiation appartient aux Puissances
étrangères au conflit, même pendant le
cours des hostilités.</p>

<p>L'exercice de ce droit ne peut jamais
être considéré par l'une ou l'autre des
Parties en litige comme un acte peu
amical.</p>

<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p>Le rôle du médiateur consiste à concilier
les prétentions opposées et à
apaiser les ressentiments qui peuvent
s'être produits entre les États en conflit.</p>

<p class="center">Article 5.</p>

<p>Les fonctions du médiateur cessent
du moment où il est constaté, soit
par l'une des Parties en litige, soit par
le médiateur lui-même, que les moyens
de conciliation proposés par lui ne
sont pas acceptés.</p>

<p class="center">Article 6.</p>

<p>Les bons offices et la médiation, soit
sur le recours des Parties en conflit,
soit sur l'initiative des Puissances
étrangères au conflit, ont exclusivement
le caractère de conseil et n'ont
jamais force obligatoire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 7.</p>

<p>L'acceptation de la médiation ne
peut avoir pour effet, sauf convention
contraire, d'interrompre, de retarder
ou d'entraver la mobilisation et autres
mesures préparatoires à la guerre.</p>

<p>Si elle intervient après l'ouverture
des hostilités, elle n'interrompt pas,
sauf convention contraire, les opérations
militaires en cours.</p>

<p class="center">Article 8.</p>

<p>Les Puissances contractantes sont
d'accord pour recommander l'application,
dans les circonstances qui le
permettent, d'une médiation spéciale
sous la forme suivante.</p>

<p>En cas de différend grave compromettant
la paix, les États en conflit
choisissent respectivement une Puissance
à laquelle ils confient la mission
d'entrer en rapport direct avec la
Puissance choisie d'autre part, à l'effet
de prévenir la rupture des relations
pacifiques.</p>

<p>Pendant la durée de ce mandat dont
le terme, sauf stipulation contraire,
ne peut excéder trente jours, les États
en litige cessent tout rapport direct au
sujet du conflit, lequel est considéré
comme déféré exclusivement aux Puissances
médiatrices. Celles-ci doivent
appliquer tous leurs efforts à régler le
différend.</p>

<p>En cas de rupture effective des relations
pacifiques, ces Puissances demeurent
chargées de la mission commune
de profiter de toute occasion
pour rétablir la paix.</p>

<p class="center1"><i>Titre III.&mdash;Des Commissions internationales
d'enquête.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 9.</p>

<p>Dans les litiges d'ordre international
n'engageant ni l'honneur ni des intérêts
essentiels et provenant d'une
divergence d'appréciation sur des
points de fait, les Puissances contractantes
jugent utile et désirable que les
Parties qui n'auraient pu se mettre
d'accord par les voies diplomatiques
instituent, en tant que les circonstances
le permettront, une Commission
internationale d'enquête chargée de
faciliter la solution de ces litiges en
éclaircissant, par un examen impartial
et consciencieux, les questions de fait.</p>

<p class="center">Article 10.</p>

<p>Les Commissions internationales
d'enquête sont constituées par convention
spéciale entre les Parties en
litige.</p>

<p>La convention d'enquête précise les
faits à examiner; elle détermine le
mode et le délai de formation de la
Commission et l'étendue des pouvoirs
des commissaires.</p>

<p>Elle détermine également, s'il y a
lieu, le siège de la Commission et la
faculté de se déplacer, la langue dont
la Commission fera usage et celles dont
l'emploi sera autorisé devant elle, ainsi
que la date à laquelle chaque Partie
devra déposer son exposé des faits,
et généralement toutes les conditions
dont les Parties sont convenues.</p>

<p>Si les Parties jugent nécessaire de
nommer des assesseurs, la convention
d'enquête détermine le mode de leur
désignation et l'étendue de leurs pouvoirs.</p>

<p class="center">Article 11.</p>

<p>Si la convention d'enquête n'a pas
désigné le siège de la Commission,
celle-ci siégera à La Haye.</p>

<p>Le siège une fois fixé ne peut être
changé par la Commission qu'avec
l'assentiment des Parties.</p>

<p>Si la convention d'enquête n'a pas
déterminé les langues à employer, il
en est décidé par la Commission.</p>

<p class="center">Article 12.</p>

<p>Sauf stipulation contraire, les Commissions
d'enquête sont formées de la
manière déterminée par les articles 45
et 57 de la présente Convention.</p>

<p class="center">Article 13.</p>

<p>En cas de décès, de démission ou
d'empêchement, pour quelque cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
que ce soit, de l'un des commissaires,
ou éventuellement de l'un des assesseurs,
il est pourvu à son remplacement
selon le mode fixé pour sa nomination.</p>

<p>Les Parties ont le droit de nommer
auprès de la Commission d'enquête des
agents spéciaux avec la mission de Les
représenter et de servir d'intermédiaires
entre Elles et la Commission.</p>

<p>Elles sont, en outre, autorisées à
charger des conseils ou avocats nommés
par elles, d'exposer et de soutenir leurs
intérêts devant la Commission.</p>

<p class="center">Article 15.</p>

<p>Le Bureau International de la Cour
permanente d'arbitrage sert de greffe
aux Commissions qui siègent à La
Haye, et mettra ses locaux et son organisation
à la disposition des Puissances
contractantes pour le fonctionnement
de la Commission d'enquête.</p>

<p class="center">Article 16.</p>

<p>Si la Commission siège ailleurs qu'à
La Haye, elle nomme un Secrétaire
Général dont le bureau lui sert de greffe.</p>

<p>Le greffe est chargé, sous l'autorité
du Président, de l'organisation matérielle
des séances de la Commission,
de la rédaction des procès-verbaux et,
pendant le temps de l'enquête, de la
garde des archives qui seront ensuite
versées au Bureau International de La
Haye.</p>

<p class="center">Article 17.</p>

<p>En vue de faciliter l'institution et
le fonctionnement des Commissions
d'enquête, les Puissances contractantes
recommandent les règles suivantes
qui seront applicables à la
procédure d'enquête en tant que les
Parties n'adopteront pas d'autres
règles.</p>

<p class="center">Article 18.</p>

<p>La Commission réglera les détails de
la procédure non prévus dans la convention
spéciale d'enquête ou dans la
présente Convention, et procédera à
toutes les formalités que comporte
l'administration des preuves.</p>

<p class="center">Article 19.</p>

<p>L'enquête a lieu contradictoirement.</p>

<p>Aux dates prévues, chaque Partie
communique à la Commission et à
l'autre Partie les exposés des faits, s'il
y a lieu, et, dans tous les cas, les actes,
pièces et documents qu'Elle juge utiles
à la découverte de la vérité, ainsi que
la liste des témoins et des experts
qu'elle désire faire entendre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 20.</p>

<p>La Commission a la faculté, avec
l'assentiment des Parties, de se transporter
momentanément sur les lieux
où elle juge utile de recourir à ce moyen
d'information ou d'y déléguer un ou
plusieurs de ses membres. L'autorisation
de l'État sur le territoire duquel
il doit être procédé à cette information
devra être obtenue.</p>

<p class="center">Article 21.</p>

<p>Toutes constatations matérielles, et
toutes visites des lieux doivent être
faites en présence des agents et conseils
des Parties ou eux dûment appelés.</p>

<p class="center">Article 22.</p>

<p>La Commission a le droit de solliciter
de l'une ou l'autre Partie telles explications
ou informations qu'elle juge
utiles.</p>

<p class="center">Article 23.</p>

<p>Les Parties s'engagent à fournir à la
Commission d'enquête, dans la plus
large mesure qu'Elles jugeront possible,
tous les moyens et toutes les facilités
nécessaires pour la connaissance complète
et l'appréciation exacte des faits
en question.</p>

<p>Elles s'engagent à user des moyens
dont Elles disposent d'après leur législation
intérieure, pour assurer la comparution
des témoins ou des experts
se trouvant sur leur territoire et cités
devant la Commission.</p>

<p>Si ceux-ci ne peuvent comparaître
devant la Commission, Elles feront
procéder à leur audition devant leurs
autorités compétentes.</p>

<p class="center">Article 24.</p>

<p>Pour toutes les notifications que la
Commission aurait à faire sur le territoire
d'une tierce Puissance contractante,
la Commission s'adressera directement
au Gouvernement de cette
Puissance. Il en sera de même s'il
s'agit de faire procéder sur place à
l'établissement de tous moyens de
preuve.</p>

<p>Les requêtes adressées à cet effet
seront exécutées suivant les moyens
dont la Puissance requise dispose
d'après Sa législation intérieure. Elles
ne peuvent être refusées que si cette
Puissance les juge de nature à porter
atteinte à Sa souveraineté ou à Sa
sécurité.</p>

<p>La Commission aura aussi toujours
la faculté de recourir à l'intermédiaire
de la Puissance sur le territoire de
laquelle elle a son siège.</p>

<p class="center">Article 25.</p>

<p>Les témoins et les experts sont
appelés à la requête des Parties ou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
d'office par la Commission, et, dans
tous les cas, par l'intermédiaire du
Gouvernement de l'État sur le territoire
duquel ils se trouvent.</p>

<p>Les témoins sont entendus, successivement
et séparément, en présence
des agents et des conseils et dans un
ordre à fixer par la Commission.</p>

<p class="center">Article 26.</p>

<p>L'interrogatoire des témoins est conduit
par le Président.</p>

<p>Les membres de la Commission
peuvent néanmoins poser à chaque
témoin les questions qu'ils croient
convenables pour éclaircir ou compléter
sa déposition, ou pour se renseigner
sur tout ce qui concerne le
témoin dans les limites nécessaires à la
manifestation de la vérité.</p>

<p>Les agents et les conseils des Parties
ne peuvent interrompre le témoin
dans sa déposition, ni lui faire aucune
interpellation directe, mais peuvent
demander au Président de poser au
témoin telles questions complémentaires
qu'ils jugent utiles.</p>

<p class="center">Article 27.</p>

<p>Le témoin doit déposer sans qu'il lui
soit permis de lire aucun projet écrit.
Toutefois, il peut être autorisé par le
Président à s'aider de notes ou documents
si la nature des faits rapportés
en nécessite l'emploi.</p>

<p class="center">Article 28.</p>

<p>Procès-verbal de la déposition du
témoin est dressé séance tenante et
lecture en est donnée au témoin. Le

<p>Lecture faite au témoin de l'ensemble
de sa déposition, le témoin est

<p>Les agents sont autorisés, au cours

<p class="center">Article 31.</p>

<p>Les séances de la Commission ne

des Parties.</p>

<p class="center">Article 32.</p>

<p>Les Parties ayant présenté tous les
éclaircissements et preuves, tous les
témoins ayant été entendus, le Président
prononce la clôture de l'enquête

et rédiger son rapport.</p>

<p class="center">Article 33.</p>

<p class="center">Article 35.</p>

<p>Le rapport de la Commission, limité

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre I.</span>&mdash;<i>De la Justice arbitrale.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 37.</p>

<p>L'arbitrage international a pour
objet le règlement de litiges entre les
États par des juges de leur choix et
sur la base du respect du droit.</p>

<p>Le recours à l'arbitrage implique
l'engagement de se soumettre de bonne
foi à la sentence.</p>

<p class="center">Article 38.</p>

<p>Dans les questions d'ordre juridique,
et en premier lieu, dans les questions
d'interprétation ou d'application des
Conventions internationales, l'arbitrage
est reconnu par les Puissances
contractantes comme le moyen le plus
efficace et en même temps le plus
équitable de régler les litiges qui n'ont
pas été résolus par les voies diplomatiques.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span></p>

<p>En conséquence, il serait désirable
que, dans les litiges sur les questions
susmentionnées, les Puissances contractantes
eussent, le cas échéant, recours
à l'arbitrage, en tant que les
circonstances le permettraient.</p>

<p class="center">Article 39.</p>

<p>La Convention d'arbitrage est conclue
pour des contestations déjà nées
ou pour des contestations éventuelles.</p>

<p>Elle peut concerner tout litige ou
seulement les litiges d'une catégorie
déterminée.</p>

<p class="center">Article 40.</p>

<p>Indépendamment des Traités généraux
ou particuliers qui stipulent
actuellement l'obligation du recours à
l'arbitrage pour les Puissances contractantes,
ces Puissances se réservent
de conclure des accords nouveaux,
généraux ou particuliers, en vue
d'étendre l'arbitrage obligatoire à tous
les cas qu'Elles jugeront possible de
lui soumettre.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre II.</span>&mdash;<i>De la Cour permanente

<p class="center">Article 41.</p>

<p>Dans le but de faciliter le recours
immédiat à l'arbitrage pour les différends
internationaux qui n'ont pu être
réglés par la voie diplomatique, les
Puissances contractantes s'engagent à
maintenir, telle qu'elle a été établie par
la Première Conférence de la Paix, la
Cour permanente d'arbitrage, accessible
en tout temps et fonctionnant,
sauf stipulation contraire des Parties,
conformément aux règles de procédure
insérées dans la présente Convention.</p>

<p class="center">Article 42.</p>

<p>La Cour permanente est compétente
pour tous les cas d'arbitrage, à moins
qu'il n'y ait entente entre les Parties
pour l'établissement d'une juridiction
spéciale.</p>

<p class="center">Article 43.</p>

<p>La cour permanente a son siège à
La Haye.</p>

<p>Un Bureau International sert de
greffe à la Cour; il est l'intermédiaire
des communications relatives aux réunions
de celle-ci; il a la garde des
archives et la gestion de toutes les
affaires administratives.</p>

<p>Les Puissances contractantes s'engagent
à communiquer au Bureau,
aussitôt que possible, une copie certifiée
conforme de toute stipulation d'arbitrage
intervenue entre Elles et de
toute sentence arbitrale Les concernant
et rendue par des juridictions spéciales.</p>

<p>Elles s'engagent à communiquer de
même au Bureau les lois, règlements et
documents constatant éventuellement
l'exécution des sentences rendues par
la Cour.</p>

<p class="center">Article 44.</p>

<p>Chaque Puissance contractante désigne
quatre personnes au plus, d'une
compétence reconnue dans les questions
de droit international, jouissant
de la plus haute considération morale
et disposées à accepter les fonctions
d'arbitre.</p>

<p>Les personnes ainsi désignées sont
inscrites, au titre de Membres de la
Cour, sur une liste qui sera notifiée à
toutes les Puissances contractantes par
les soins du Bureau.</p>

<p>Toute modification à la liste des
arbitres est portée, par les soins du
Bureau, à la connaissance des Puissances
contractantes.</p>

<p>Deux ou plusieurs Puissances peuvent
s'entendre pour la désignation en
commun d'un ou de plusieurs Membres.</p>

<p>La même personne peut être désignée
par des Puissances différentes.</p>

<p>Les Membres de la Cour sont
nommés pour un terme de six ans.
Leur mandat peut être renouvelé.</p>

<p>En cas de décès ou de retraite d'un
Membre de la Cour, il est pourvu à
son remplacement selon le mode fixé
pour sa nomination, et pour une nouvelle
période de six ans.</p>

<p class="center">Article 45.</p>

<p>Lorsque les Puissances contractantes
veulent s'adresser à la Cour permanente
pour le règlement d'un différend
survenu entre Elles, le choix des
arbitres appelés à former le Tribunal
compétent pour statuer sur ce différend,
doit être fait dans la liste générale des
Membres de la Cour.</p>

<p>A défaut de constitution du Tribunal
arbitral par l'accord des Parties, il est
procédé de la manière suivante:</p>

<p>Chaque Partie nomme deux arbitres,
dont un seulement peut être son
national ou choisi parmi ceux qui ont
été désignés par Elle comme Membres
de la Cour permanente. Ces arbitres
choisissent ensemble un surarbitre.</p>

<p>En cas de partage des voix, le choix
du surarbitre est confié à une Puissance
tierce, désignée de commun
accord par les Parties.</p>

<p>Si l'accord ne s'établit pas à ce sujet,
chaque Partie désigne une Puissance
différente et le choix du surarbitre est
fait de concert par les Puissances ainsi
désignées.</p>

<p>Si, dans un délai de deux mois, ces
deux Puissances n'ont pu tomber
d'accord, chacune d'Elles présente
deux candidats pris sur la liste des
Membres de la Cour permanente, en
dehors des Membres désignés par les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
Parties et n'étant les nationaux d'aucune
d'Elles. Le sort détermine lequel
des candidats ainsi présentés sera le
surarbitre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 46.</p>

<p>Dès que le Tribunal est composé, les
Parties notifient au Bureau leur décision
de s'adresser à la Cour, le texte
de leur compromis, et les noms des
arbitres.</p>

<p>Le Bureau communique sans délai
à chaque arbitre le compromis et les
noms des autres Membres du Tribunal.</p>

<p>Le Tribunal se réunit à la date fixée
par les Parties. Le Bureau pourvoit
à son installation.</p>

<p>Les Membres du Tribunal, dans
l'exercice de leurs fonctions et en dehors
de leur pays, jouissent des privilèges
et immunités diplomatiques.</p>

<p class="center">Article 47.</p>

<p>Le Bureau est autorisé à mettre ses
locaux et son organisation à la disposition
des Puissances contractantes pour
le fonctionnement de toute juridiction
spéciale d'arbitrage.</p>

<p>La juridiction de la Cour permanente
peut être étendue, dans les conditions
prescrites par les règlements, aux litiges
existant entre des Puissances non contractantes
ou entre des Puissances contractantes
et des Puissances non contractantes,
si les Parties sont convenues
de recourir à cette juridiction.</p>

<p class="center">Article 48.</p>

<p>Les Puissances contractantes considèrent
comme un devoir, dans le cas
où un conflit aigu menacerait d'éclater
entre deux ou plusieurs d'entre Elles,
de rappeler à celles-ci que la Cour permanente
leur est ouverte.</p>

<p>En conséquence, Elles déclarent que
le fait de rappeler aux Parties en conflit
les dispositions de la présente Convention,
et le conseil donné, dans l'intérêt
supérieur de la paix, de s'adresser à la
Cour permanente, ne peuvent être
considérés que comme actes de bons
offices.</p>

<p>En cas de conflit entre deux Puissances,
l'une d'Elles pourra toujours
adresser au Bureau International une
note contenant sa déclaration qu'Elle
serait disposée à soumettre le différend
à un arbitrage.</p>

<p>Le Bureau devra porter aussitôt la
déclaration à la connaissance de l'autre
Puissance.</p>

<p class="center">Article 49.</p>

<p>Le Conseil administratif permanent,
composé des Représentants diplomatiques
des Puissances contractantes
accrédités à La Haye et du Ministre des
Affaires Étrangères des Pays-Bas, qui
remplit les fonctions de Président, a la
direction et le contrôle du Bureau
International.</p>

<p>Le Conseil arrête son règlement
d'ordre ainsi que tous autres règlements
nécessaires.</p>

<p>Il décide toutes les questions administratives
qui pourraient surgir
touchant le fonctionnement de la Cour.</p>

<p>Il a tout pouvoir quant à la nomination,
la suspension ou la révocation des
fonctionnaires et employés du Bureau.</p>

<p>Il fixe les traitements et salaires, et
contrôle la dépense générale.</p>

<p>La présence de neuf membres dans
les réunions dûment convoquées suffit
pour permettre au Conseil de délibérer
valablement. Les décisions
sont prises à la majorité des voix.</p>

<p>Le Conseil communique sans délai
aux Puissances contractantes les règlements
adoptés par lui. Il Leur présente
chaque année un rapport sur les
travaux de la Cour, sur le fonctionnement
des services administratifs et sur
les dépenses. Le rapport contient
également un résumé du contenu
essentiel des documents communiqués
au Bureau par les Puissances en vertu

<p class="center">Article 51.</p>

<p>En vue de favoriser le développement
de l'arbitrage, les Puissances
contractantes ont arrêté les règles
suivantes qui sont applicables à la
procédure arbitrale, en tant que les
Parties ne sont pas convenues d'autres
règles.</p>

<p class="center">Article 52.</p>

<p>Les Puissances qui recourent à
l'arbitrage signent un compromis dans
lequel sont déterminés l'objet du litige,
le délai de nomination des arbitres, la
forme, l'ordre et les délais dans lesquels
la communication visée par l'article 63
devra être faite, et le montant de la
somme que chaque Partie aura à déposer
à titre d'avance pour les frais.</p>

<p>Le compromis détermine également,
s'il y a lieu, le mode de nomination des
arbitres, tous pouvoirs spéciaux éventuels
du Tribunal, son siège, la langue
dont il fera usage et celles dont l'emploi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span>
sera autorisé devant lui, et généralement
toutes les conditions dont les
Parties sont convenues.</p>

<p class="center">Article 53.</p>

<p>La Cour permanente est compétente
pour l'établissement du compromis, si
les Parties sont d'accord pour s'en
remettre à elle.</p>

<p>Elle est également compétente,
même si la demande est faite seulement
par l'une des Parties, après qu'un
accord par la voie diplomatique a été
vainement essayé, quand il s'agit:</p>

<p>1<span class="topnum">o</span>. d'un différend rentrant dans un
Traité d'arbitrage général conclu ou
renouvelé après la mise en vigueur de
cette Convention et qui prévoit pour
chaque différend un compromis et
n'exclut pour l'établissement de ce
dernier ni explicitement ni implicitement
la compétence de la Cour. Toutefois,
le recours à la Cour n'a pas lieu
si l'autre Partie déclare qu'à son avis
le différend n'appartient pas à la catégorie
des différends à soumettre à un
arbitrage obligatoire, à moins que le
Traité d'arbitrage ne confère au Tribunal
arbitral le pouvoir de décider
cette question préalable;</p>

<p>2<span class="topnum">o</span>. d'un différend provenant de
dettes contractuelles réclamées à une
Puissance par une autre Puissance
comme dues à ses nationaux, et pour la
solution duquel l'offre d'arbitrage a
été acceptée. Cette disposition n'est
pas applicable si l'acceptation a été
subordonnée à la condition que le
compromis soit établi selon un autre
mode.</p>

<p class="center">Article 54.</p>

<p>Dans les cas prévus par l'article précédent,
le compromis sera établi par
une commission composée de cinq
membres désignés de la manière prévue
à l'article 45 alinéas 3 à 6.</p>

<p>Le cinquième membre est de droit
Président de la commission.</p>

<p class="center">Article 55.</p>

<p>Les fonctions arbitrales peuvent être
conférées à un arbitre unique ou à
plusieurs arbitres désignés par les
Parties à leur gré, ou choisis par Elles
parmi les Membres de la Cour permanente
d'arbitrage établie par la présente
Convention.</p>

<p>A défaut de constitution du Tribunal
par l'accord des Parties, il est procédé
de la manière indiquée à l'article 45
alinéas 3 à 6.</p>

<p class="center">Article 56.</p>

<p>Lorsqu'un Souverain ou un Chef
d'Etat est choisi pour arbitre, la procédure
arbitrale est réglée par Lui.</p>

<p class="center">Article 57.</p>

<p>Le surarbitre est de droit Président
du Tribunal.</p>

<p>Lorsque le Tribunal ne comprend
pas de surarbitre, il nomme lui-même
son Président.</p>

<p class="center">Article 58.</p>

<p>En cas d'établissement du compromis
par une commission, telle qu'elle
est visée à l'article 54, et sauf stipulation
contraire, la commission elle-même
formera le Tribunal d'arbitrage.</p>

<p class="center">Article 59.</p>

<p>En cas de décès, de démission ou
d'empêchement, pour quelque cause
que ce soit, de l'un des arbitres, il est
pourvu à son remplacement selon le
mode fixé pour sa nomination.</p>

<p class="center">Article 60.</p>

<p>A défaut de désignation par les
Parties, le Tribunal siège à La Haye.</p>

<p>Le Tribunal ne peut siéger sur le territoire
d'une tierce Puissance qu'avec
l'assentiment de celle-ci.</p>

<p>Le siège une fois fixé ne peut être
changé par le Tribunal qu'avec l'assentiment
des Parties.</p>

<p class="center">Article 61.</p>

<p>Si le compromis n'a pas déterminé
les langues à employer, il en est décidé
par le Tribunal.</p>

<p class="center">Article 62.</p>

<p>Les Parties ont le droit de nommer
auprès du Tribunal des agents spéciaux,
avec la mission de servir d'intermédiaires
entre Elles et le Tribunal.</p>

<p>Elles sont en outre autorisées à
charger de la défense de leurs droits et
intérêts devant le Tribunal, des conseils
ou avocats nommés par Elles à cet effet.</p>

<p>Les Membres de la Cour permanente
ne peuvent exercer les fonctions
d'agents, conseils ou avocats, qu'en
faveur de la Puissance qui les a
nommés Membres de la Cour.</p>

<p class="center">Article 63.</p>

<p>La procédure arbitrale comprend en
règle générale deux phases distinctes:
l'instruction écrite et les débats.</p>

<p>L'instruction écrite consiste dans la
communication faite par les agents
respectifs, aux membres du Tribunal
et à la Partie adverse, des mémoires,
des contre-mémoires et, au besoin, des
répliques; les Parties y joignent toutes
pièces et documents invoqués dans la
cause. Cette communication aura lieu,
directement ou par l'intermédiaire du
Bureau International, dans l'ordre et
dans les délais déterminés par le compromis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span></p>

<p>Les délais fixés par le compromis
pourront être prolongés de commun
accord par les Parties, ou par le Tribunal
quand il le juge nécessaire pour
arriver à une décision juste.</p>

<p>Les débats consistent dans le développement
oral des moyens des
Parties devant le Tribunal.</p>

<p class="center">Article 64.</p>

<p>Toute pièce produite par l'une des
Parties doit être communiquée, en
copie certifiée conforme, à l'autre
Partie.</p>

<p class="center">Article 65.</p>

<p>A moins de circonstances spéciales,
le Tribunal ne se réunit qu'après la
clôture de l'instruction.</p>

<p class="center">Article 66.</p>

<p>Les débats sont dirigés par le Président.</p>

<p>Ils ne sont publics qu'en vertu d'une
décision du Tribunal, prise avec l'assentiment
des Parties.</p>

<p>Ils sont consignés dans des procès-verbaux
rédigés par des secrétaires que
nomme le Président. Ces procès-verbaux
sont signés par le Président et
par un des secrétaires; ils ont seuls
caractère authentique.</p>

<p class="center">Article 67.</p>

<p>L'instruction étant close, le Tribunal
a le droit d'écarter du débat
tous actes ou documents nouveaux
qu'une des Parties voudrait lui soumettre
sans le consentement de l'autre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 68.</p>

<p>Le Tribunal demeure libre de prendre
en considération les actes ou documents
nouveaux sur lesquels les agents ou
conseils des Parties appelleraient son
attention.</p>

<p>En ce cas, le Tribunal a le droit de
requérir la production de ces actes ou
documents, sauf l'obligation d'en
donner connaissance à la Partie adverse.</p>

<p class="center">Article 69.</p>

<p>Le Tribunal peut, en outre, requérir
des agents des Parties la production de
tous actes et demander toutes explications
nécessaires. En cas de refus, le
Tribunal en prend acte.</p>

<p class="center">Article 70.</p>

<p>Les agents et les conseils des Parties
sont autorisés à présenter oralement au
Tribunal tous les moyens qu'ils jugent
utiles à la défense de leur cause.</p>

<p class="center">Article 71.</p>

<p>Ils ont le droit de soulever des exceptions
et des incidents. Les décisions
du Tribunal sur ces points sont
définitives et ne peuvent donner lieu
à aucune discussion ultérieure.</p>

<p class="center">Article 72.</p>

<p>Les membres du Tribunal ont le
droit de poser des questions aux agents

demander des éclaircissements sur les
points douteux.</p>

<p>Ni les questions posées, ni les observations
faites par les membres du
Tribunal pendant le cours des débats
ne peuvent être regardées comme l'expression
des opinions du Tribunal en
général ou de ses membres en particulier.</p>

<p class="center">Article 73.</p>

<p>Le Tribunal est autorisé à déterminer
sa compétence en interprétant le
compromis ainsi que les autres Traités
qui peuvent être invoqués dans la
matière, et en appliquant les principes
du droit.</p>

<p class="center">Article 74.</p>

<p>Le Tribunal a le droit de rendre des
ordonnances de procédure pour la
direction du procès, de déterminer les
formes, l'ordre et les délais dans
lesquels chaque Partie devra prendre
ses conclusions finales, et de procéder
à toutes les formalités que comporte
l'administration des preuves.</p>

<p class="center">Article 75.</p>

<p>Les Parties s'engagent à fournir au

<p class="center">Article 76.</p>

<p>Pour toutes les notifications que le
Tribunal aurait à faire sur le territoire
d'une tierce Puissance contractante, le
Tribunal s'adressera directement au
Gouvernement de cette Puissance. Il
en sera de même s'il s'agit de faire
procéder sur place à l'établissement de
tous moyens de preuve.</p>

<p>Les requêtes adressées à cet effet
seront exécutées suivant les moyens
dont la Puissance requise dispose
d'après sa législation intérieure. Elles
ne peuvent être refusées que si cette
Puissance les juge de nature à porter
atteinte à sa souveraineté ou à sa
sécurité.</p>

<p>Le Tribunal aura aussi toujours la
faculté de recourir à l'intermédiaire de
la Puissance sur le territoire de laquelle
il a son siège.</p>

<p>Tout différend qui pourrait surgir

<p class="center">Article 83.</p>

<p>Les Parties peuvent se réserver dans
le compromis de demander la révision
de la sentence arbitrale.</p>

<p>Dans ce cas, et sauf stipulation
contraire, la demande doit être adressée
au Tribunal qui a rendu la sentence.
Elle ne peut être motivée que par la
découverte d'un fait nouveau qui eût
été de nature à exercer une influence
décisive sur la sentence et qui, lors de
la clôture des débats, était inconnu du
Tribunal lui-même et de la Partie qui
a demandé la révision.</p>

<p>La procédure de révision ne peut
être ouverte que par une décision du
Tribunal constatant expressément l'existence
du fait nouveau, lui reconnaissant
les caractères prévus par le paragraphe
précédent et déclarant à ce
titre la demande recevable.</p>

<p>Le compromis détermine le délai
dans lequel la demande de révision
doit être formée.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre I.</span>&mdash;<i>De la qualité de
belligérant.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article premier.</p>

<p>Les lois, les droits et les devoirs de la
guerre ne s'appliquent pas seulement à
l'armée, mais encore aux milices et aux
corps de volontaires réunissant les conditions
suivantes:</p>

<p>1<span class="topnum">o</span>. d'avoir à leur tête une personne
responsable pour ses subordonnés;</p>

<p>2<span class="topnum">o</span>. d'avoir un signe distinctif fixe et

et</p>

aux lois et coutumes de la guerre.</p>

<p>Dans les pays où les milices ou des
corps de volontaires constituent l'armée
ou en font partie, ils sont compris sous
la dénomination d'<i>armée</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Article 2.</p>

<p>La population d'un territoire non
occupé qui, à l'approche de l'ennemi,
prend spontanément les armes pour
combattre les troupes d'invasion sans
avoir eu le temps de s'organiser conformément
à l'article premier, sera
considérée comme belligérante si elle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
porte les armes ouvertement et si elle
respecte les lois et coutumes de la
guerre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 3.</p>

<p>Les forces armées des parties belligérantes
peuvent se composer de combattants
et de non-combattants. En
cas de capture par l'ennemi, les uns et
les autres ont droit au traitement des
prisonniers de guerre.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre II.</span>&mdash;<i>Des prisonniers
de guerre.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p>Les prisonniers de guerre sont au
pouvoir du Gouvernement ennemi,
mais non des individus ou des corps
qui les ont capturés.</p>

<p>Ils doivent être traités avec humanité.</p>

<p>Tout ce qui leur appartient personnellement,
excepté les armes, les
chevaux et les papiers militaires, reste
leur propriété.</p>

<p class="center">Article 5.</p>

<p>Les prisonniers de guerre peuvent
être assujettis à l'internement dans une
ville, forteresse, camp ou localité quelconque,
avec obligation de ne pas s'en
éloigner au delà de certaines limites
déterminées; mais ils ne peuvent être
enfermés que par mesure de sûreté
indispensable, et seulement pendant la
durée des circonstances qui nécessitent
cette mesure.</p>

<p class="center">Article 6.</p>

<p>L'État peut employer, comme travailleurs,
les prisonniers de guerre,
selon leur grade et leurs aptitudes, à
l'exception des officiers. Ces travaux
ne seront pas excessifs et n'auront
aucun rapport avec les opérations de
la guerre.</p>

<p>Les prisonniers peuvent être autorisés
à travailler pour le compte d'administrations
publiques ou de particuliers,
ou pour leur propre compte.</p>

<p>Les travaux faits pour l'État sont
payés d'après les tarifs en vigueur pour
les militaires de l'armée nationale exécutant
les mêmes travaux, ou, s'il n'en
existe pas, d'après un tarif en rapport
avec les travaux exécutés.</p>

<p>Lorsque les travaux ont lieu pour le
compte d'autres administrations publiques
ou pour des particuliers, les conditions
en sont réglées d'accord avec
l'autorité militaire.</p>

<p>Le salaire des prisonniers contribuera
à adoucir leur position, et le surplus
leur sera compté au moment de leur
libération, sauf défalcation des frais
d'entretien.</p>

<p class="center">Article 7.</p>

<p>Le Gouvernement au pouvoir duquel
se trouvent les prisonniers de guerre
est chargé de leur entretien.</p>

<p>A défaut d'une entente spéciale entre
les belligérants, les prisonniers de
guerre seront traités pour la nourriture,
le couchage et l'habillement, sur le
même pied que les troupes du Gouvernement
qui les aura capturés.</p>

<p class="center">Article 8.</p>

<p>Les prisonniers de guerre seront
soumis aux lois, règlements et ordres en
vigueur dans l'armée de l'État au pouvoir
duquel ils se trouvent. Tout acte
d'insubordination autorise, à leur égard,
les mesures de rigueur nécessaires.</p>

<p>Les prisonniers évadés, qui seraient
repris avant d'avoir pu rejoindre leur
armée ou avant de quitter le territoire
occupé par l'armée qui les aura capturés,
sont passibles de peines disciplinaires.</p>

<p>Les prisonniers qui, après avoir
réussi à s'évader, sont de nouveau
faits prisonniers, ne sont passibles
d'aucune peine pour la fuite antérieure.</p>

<p class="center">Article 9.</p>

<p>Chaque prisonnier de guerre est tenu
de déclarer, s'il est interrogé à ce sujet,
ses véritables noms et grade et, dans le
cas où il enfreindrait cette règle, il
s'exposerait à une restriction des avantages
accordés aux prisonniers de guerre
de sa catégorie.</p>

<p class="center">Article 10.</p>

<p>Les prisonniers de guerre peuvent
être mis en liberté sur parole, si les lois
de leur pays les y autorisent, et, en pareil
cas, ils sont obligés, sous la garantie de
leur honneur personnel, de remplir
scrupuleusement, tant vis-à-vis de leur
propre Gouvernement que vis-à-vis de
celui qui les a faits prisonniers, les
engagements qu'ils auraient contractés.</p>

<p>Dans le même cas, leur propre
Gouvernement est tenu de n'exiger ni
accepter d'eux aucun service contraire
à la parole donnée.</p>

<p class="center">Article 11.</p>

<p>Un prisonnier de guerre ne peut être
contraint d'accepter sa liberté sur
parole; de même le Gouvernement
ennemi n'est pas obligé d'accéder à la
demande du prisonnier réclamant sa
mise en liberté sur parole.</p>

<p class="center">Article 12.</p>

<p>Tout prisonnier de guerre, libéré
sur parole et repris portant les armes
contre le Gouvernement envers lequel
il s'était engagé d'honneur, ou contre
les alliés de celui-ci, perd le droit au<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
traitement des prisonniers de guerre et
peut être traduit devant les tribunaux.</p>

<p class="center">Article 13.</p>

<p>Les individus qui suivent une armée
sans en faire directement partie, tels
que les correspondants et les reporters
de journaux, les vivandiers, les fournisseurs,
qui tombent au pouvoir de
l'ennemi et que celui-ci juge utile de
détenir, ont droit au traitement des
prisonniers de guerre, à condition
qu'ils soient munis d'une légitimation
de l'autorité militaire de l'armée qu'ils
accompagnaient.</p>

<p class="center">Article 14.</p>

<p>Il est constitué, dès le début des hostilités,
dans chacun des États belligérants,
et, le cas échéant, dans les pays
neutres qui auront recueilli des belligérants
sur leur territoire, un bureau de
renseignements sur les prisonniers de
guerre. Ce bureau, chargé de répondre
à toutes les demandes qui les
concernent, reçoit des divers services
compétents toutes les indications relatives
aux internements et aux mutations,
aux mises en liberté sur parole,
aux échanges, aux évasions, aux
entrées dans les hôpitaux, aux décès,
ainsi que les autres renseignements
nécessaires pour établir et tenir à jour
une fiche individuelle pour chaque
prisonnier de guerre. Le bureau devra
porter sur cette fiche le numéro matricule,
les nom et prénom, l'âge, le lieu
d'origine, le grade, le corps de troupe,
les blessures, la date et le lieu de la
capture, de l'internement, des blessures
et de la mort, ainsi que toutes les observations
particulières. La fiche individuelle
sera remise au Gouvernement
de l'autre belligérant après la conclusion
de la paix.</p>

<p>Le bureau de renseignements est
également chargé de recueillir et de
centraliser tous les objets d'un usage
personnel, valeurs, lettres, etc., qui
seront trouvés sur les champs de
bataille ou délaissés par des prisonniers
libérés sur parole, échangés, évadés ou
décédés dans les hôpitaux et ambulances,
et de les transmettre aux intéressés.</p>

<p class="center">Article 15.</p>

<p>Les sociétés de secours pour les
prisonniers de guerre, régulièrement
constituées selon la loi de leur pays et
ayant pour objet d'être les intermédiaires
de l'action charitable, recevront,
de la part des belligérants, pour elles
et pour leurs agents dûment accrédités,
toute facilité, dans les limites tracées
par les nécessités militaires et les règles
administratives, pour accomplir efficacement
leur tâche d'humanité. Les
délégués de ces sociétés pourront être
admis à distribuer des secours dans les
dépôts d'internement, ainsi qu'aux
lieux d'étape des prisonniers rapatriés,
moyennant une permission personnelle
délivrée par l'autorité militaire, et en
prenant l'engagement par écrit de se
soumettre à toutes les mesures d'ordre
et de police que celle-ci prescrirait.</p>

<p class="center">Article 16.</p>

<p>Les bureaux de renseignements jouissent
de la franchise de port. Les
lettres, mandats et articles d'argent,
ainsi que les colis postaux destinés aux
prisonniers de guerre ou expédiés par
eux, seront affranchis de toutes les
taxes postales, aussi bien dans les pays
d'origine et de destination que dans
les pays intermédiaires.</p>

<p>Les dons et secours en nature destinés
aux prisonniers de guerre seront
admis en franchise de tous droits
d'entrée et autres, ainsi que des taxes
de transport sur les chemins de fer
exploités par l'État.</p>

<p class="center">Article 17.</p>

<p>Les officiers prisonniers recevront la
solde à laquelle ont droit les officiers
de même grade du pays où ils sont
retenus, à charge de remboursement
par leur Gouvernement.</p>

<p class="center">Article 18.</p>

<p>Toute latitude est laissée aux prisonniers
de guerre pour l'exercice de
leur religion, y compris l'assistance aux
offices de leur culte, à la seule condition
de se conformer aux mesures d'ordre
et de police prescrites par l'autorité
militaire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 19.</p>

<p>Les testaments des prisonniers de
guerre sont reçus ou dressés dans les
mêmes conditions que pour les militaires
de l'armée nationale.</p>

<p>On suivra également les mêmes
règles en ce qui concerne les pièces
relatives à la constatation des décès,
ainsi que pour l'inhumation des prisonniers
de guerre, en tenant compte
de leur grade et de leur rang.</p>

<p class="center">Article 20.</p>

<p>Après la conclusion de la paix, le
rapatriement des prisonniers de guerre
s'effectuera dans le plus bref délai
possible.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre III.</span>&mdash;<i>Des malades et des
blessés.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 21.</p>

<p>Les obligations des belligérants concernant
le service des malades et des
blessés sont régies par la Convention
de Genève.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg 607]</a></span></p>

<p class="center1">SECTION II.&mdash;DES HOSTILITÉS.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre I.</span>&mdash;<i>Des moyens de nuire à
l'ennemi, des sièges et des bombardements.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 22.</p>

<p>Les belligérants n'ont pas un droit
illimité quant au choix des moyens de
nuire à l'ennemi.</p>

<p class="center">Article 23.</p>

<p>Outre les prohibitions établies par
des conventions spéciales, il est notamment
interdit:</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>a</i>) d'employer du poison ou des
armes empoisonnées;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>b</i>) de tuer ou de blesser par trahison
des individus appartenant à la
nation ou à l'armée ennemie;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>c</i>) de tuer ou de blesser un ennemi
qui, ayant mis bas les armes ou
n'ayant plus les moyens de se défendre,
s'est rendu à discrétion;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>d</i>) de déclarer qu'il ne sera pas
fait de quartier;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>e</i>) d'employer des armes, des projectiles
ou des matières propres à
causer des maux superflus;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>f</i>) d'user indûment du pavillon
parlementaire, du pavillon national
ou des insignes militaires et de l'uniforme
de l'ennemi, ainsi que des
signes distinctifs de la Convention de
Genève;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>g</i>) de détruire ou de saisir des
propriétés ennemies, sauf les cas où ces
destructions ou ces saisies seraient
impérieusement commandées par les
nécessités de la guerre;</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>h</i>) de déclarer éteints, suspendus
ou non recevables en justice, les
droits et actions des nationaux de
la Partie adverse.</p>

<p>Il est également interdit à un belligérant
de forcer les nationaux de la
Partie adverse à prendre part aux
opérations de guerre dirigées contre
leur pays, même dans le cas où ils
auraient été à son service avant le
commencement de la guerre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 24.</p>

<p>Les ruses de guerre et l'emploi des
moyens nécessaires pour se procurer
des renseignements sur l'ennemi et sur
le terrain sont considérés comme licites.</p>

<p class="center">Article 25.</p>

<p>Il est interdit d'attaquer ou de bombarder,
par quelque moyen que ce soit
des villes, villages, habitations ou
bâtiments qui ne sont pas défendus.</p>

<p class="center">Article 26.</p>

<p>Le commandant des troupes assaillantes,
avant d'entreprendre le bombardement,
et sauf le cas d'attaque de
vive force, devra faire tout ce qui dépend
de lui pour en avertir les autorités.</p>

<p class="center">Article 27.</p>

<p>Dans les sièges et bombardements,
toutes les mesures nécessaires doivent
être prises pour épargner, autant que
possible, les édifices consacrés aux
cultes, aux arts, aux sciences et à la
bienfaisance, les monuments historiques,
les hôpitaux et les lieux de
rassemblement de malades et de
blessés, à condition qu'ils ne soient pas
employés en même temps à un but
militaire.</p>

<p>Le devoir des assiégés est de désigner
ces édifices ou lieux de rassemblement
par des signes visibles spéciaux
qui seront notifiés d'avance à l'assiégeant.</p>

<p class="center">Article 28.</p>

<p>Il est interdit de livrer au pillage
une ville ou localité même prise
d'assaut.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre II.</span>&mdash;<i>Des espions.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 29.</p>

<p>Ne peut être considéré comme
espion que l'individu qui, agissant
clandestinement ou sous de faux prétextes,
recueille ou cherche à recueillir
des informations dans la zone d'opérations
d'un belligérant, avec l'intention
de les communiquer à la partie adverse.</p>

<p>Ainsi les militaires non déguisés qui
ont pénétré dans la zone d'opérations
de l'armée ennemie, à l'effet de recueillir
des informations, ne sont pas
considérés comme espions. De même,
ne sont pas considérés comme espions:
les militaires et les non militaires, accomplissant
ouvertement leur mission,
chargés de transmettre des dépêches
destinées, soit à leur propre armée,
soit à l'armée ennemie. A cette catégorie
appartiennent également les individus
envoyés en ballon pour transmettre
les dépêches, et, en général,
pour entretenir les communications
entre les diverses parties d'une armée
ou d'un territoire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 30.</p>

<p>L'espion pris sur le fait ne pourra
être puni sans jugement préalable.</p>

<p class="center">Article 31.</p>

<p>L'espion qui, ayant rejoint l'armée à
laquelle il appartient, est capturé plus
tard par l'ennemi, est traité comme
prisonnier de guerre et n'encourt aucune
responsabilité pour ses actes
d'espionnage antérieurs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre III.</span>&mdash;<i>Des parlementaires.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 32.</p>

<p>Est considéré comme parlementaire
l'individu autorisé par l'un des belligérants
à entrer en pourparlers avec
l'autre et se présentant avec le drapeau
blanc. Il a droit à l'inviolabilité ainsi
que le trompette, clairon ou tambour,
le porte-drapeau et l'interprète qui
l'accompagneraient.</p>

<p class="center">Article 33.</p>

<p>Le chef auquel un parlementaire est
expédié n'est pas obligé de le recevoir
en toutes circonstances.</p>

<p>Il peut prendre toutes les mesures
nécessaires afin d'empêcher le parlementaire
de profiter de sa mission pour
se renseigner.</p>

<p>Il a le droit, en cas d'abus, de retenir
temporairement le parlementaire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 34.</p>

<p>Le parlementaire perd ses droits
d'inviolabilité, s'il est prouvé, d'une
manière positive et irrécusable, qu'il a
profité de sa position privilégiée pour
provoquer ou commettre un acte de
trahison.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Des capitulations.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 35.</p>

<p>Les capitulations arrêtées entre les
parties contractantes doivent tenir
compte des règles de l'honneur militaire.</p>

<p>Une fois fixées, elles doivent être
scrupuleusement observées par les
deux parties.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre V.</span>&mdash;<i>De l'armistice.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre I</span><span class="topnum">er</span>.&mdash;<i>Du bombardement des
ports, villes, villages, habitations ou
bâtiments non défendus.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article premier.</p>

<p>Il est interdit de bombarder, par des
forces navales, des ports, villes, villages,
habitations ou bâtiments, qui ne sont
pas défendus.</p>

<p>Une localité ne peut pas être bombardée
à raison du seul fait que, devant
son port, se trouvent mouillées des
mines sous-marines automatiques de
contact.</p>

<p class="center">Article 2.</p>

<p>Toutefois, ne sont pas compris dans
cette interdiction les ouvrages militaires,
établissements militaires ou
navals, dépôts d'armes ou de matériel
de guerre, ateliers et installations
propres à être utilisés pour les besoins
de la flotte ou de l'armée ennemie, et
les navires de guerre se trouvant dans
le port. Le commandant d'une force
navale pourra, après sommation avec
délai raisonnable, les détruire par
le canon, si tout autre moyen est
impossible et lorsque les autorités
locales n'auront pas procédé à cette
destruction dans le délai fixé.</p>

<p>Il n'encourt aucune responsabilité
dans ce cas pour les dommages involontaires,
qui pourraient être occasionnés
par le bombardement.</p>

<p>Si des nécessités militaires, exigeant
une action immédiate, ne permettaient
pas d'accorder de délai, il reste entendu
que l'interdiction de bombarder la
ville non défendue subsiste comme dans
le cas énoncé dans l'alinéa 1<span class="topnum">er</span> et que le
commandant prendra toutes les dispositions
voulues pour qu'il en résulte
pour cette ville le moins d'inconvénients
possible.</p>

<p class="center">Article 3.</p>

<p>Il peut, après notification expresse,
être procédé au bombardement des
ports, villes, villages, habitations ou
bâtiments non défendus, si les autorités
locales, mises en demeure par une
sommation formelle, refusent d'obtempérer
à des réquisitions de vivres
ou d'approvisionnements nécessaires au
besoin présent de la force navale qui se
trouve devant la localité.</p>

<p>Ces réquisitions seront en rapport
avec les ressources de la localité. Elles
ne seront réclamées qu'avec l'autorisation
du commandant de ladite force
navale et elles seront, autant que
possible, payées au comptant; sinon
elles seront constatées par des reçus.</p>

<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p>Est interdit le bombardement, pour
le non paiement des contributions en
argent, des ports, villes, villages, habitations
ou bâtiments, non défendus.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre II.</span>&mdash;<i>Dispositions générales.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 5.</p>

<p>Dans le bombardement par des
forces navales, toutes les mesures
nécessaires doivent être prises par le
commandant pour épargner, autant
que possible, les édifices consacrés aux
cultes, aux arts, aux sciences et à la
bienfaisance, les monuments historiques,
les hôpitaux et les lieux de
rassemblement de malades ou de
blessés, à condition qu'ils ne soient pas
employés en même temps à un but
militaire.</p>

<p>Le devoir des habitants est de désigner
ces monuments, ces édifices ou
lieux de rassemblement, par des signes
visibles, qui consisteront en grands
panneaux rectangulaires rigides, partagés,
suivant une des diagonales, en
deux triangles de couleur, noire en
haut et blanche en bas.</p>

<p class="center">Article 6.</p>

<p>Sauf le cas où les exigences militaires
ne le permettraient pas, le
commandant de la force navale assaillante
doit, avant d'entreprendre le
bombardement, faire tout ce qui dépend
de lui pour avertir les autorités.</p>

<p class="center">Article 7.</p>

<p>Il est interdit de livrer au pillage
une ville ou localité même prise
d'assaut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span></p>

<p>Les bâtiments hospitaliers, équipés
en totalité ou en partie aux frais des
particuliers ou des sociétés officiellement
reconnues de pays neutres, sont
respectés et exempts de capture, à
condition qu'ils se soient mis sous la
direction de l'un des belligérants, avec
l'assentiment préalable de leur propre
Gouvernement et avec l'autorisation
du belligérant lui-même et que ce

tout emploi.</p>

<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p>Les bâtiments qui sont mentionnés

<p>Les Gouvernements s'engagent à
n'utiliser ces bâtiments pour aucun but

viennent d'être mentionnés, comme les
petits bâtiments qui pourront être
affectés au service hospitalier, se distingueront

croix-rouge prévu par la Convention de
Genève et, en outre, s'ils ressortissent

qu'ils accompagnent, à prendre les
mesures nécessaires pour que la peinture
qui les caractérise soit suffisamment
apparente.</p>

au zèle charitable des commandants de
bâtiments de commerce, yachts ou
embarcations neutres, pour prendre à
bord et soigner des blessés ou des
malades.</p>

<p>Les bâtiments qui auront répondu à<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[Pg 619]</a></span>
cet appel ainsi que ceux qui spontanément
auront recueilli des blessés, des
malades ou des naufragés, jouiront
d'une protection spéciale et de certaines
immunités. En aucun cas, ils
ne pourront être capturés pour le fait
d'un tel transport; mais, sauf les
promesses qui leur auraient été faites,
ils restent exposés à la capture pour les
violations de neutralité qu'ils pourraient
avoir commises.</p>

<p class="center">Article 10.</p>

<p>Le personnel religieux, médical et
hospitalier de tout bâtiment capturé
est inviolable et ne peut être fait
prisonnier de guerre. Il emporte, en
quittant le navire, les objets et les
instruments de chirurgie qui sont sa
propriété particulière.</p>

<p>Ce personnel continuera à remplir
ses fonctions tant que cela sera nécessaire
et il pourra ensuite se retirer,
lorsque le commandant en chef le
jugera possible.</p>

<p>Les belligérants doivent assurer à
ce personnel tombé entre leurs mains,
les mêmes allocations et la même solde
qu'au personnel des mêmes grades de
leur propre marine.</p>

<p class="center">Article 11.</p>

<p>Les marins et les militaires embarqués,
et les autres personnes officiellement
attachées aux marines ou
aux armées, blessés ou malades, à
quelque nation qu'ils appartiennent,
seront respectés et soignés par les
capteurs.</p>

<p class="center">Article 12.</p>

<p>Tout vaisseau de guerre d'une partie
belligérante peut réclamer la remise des
blessés, malades ou naufragés, qui sont
à bord de bâtiments-hôpitaux militaires,
de bâtiments hospitaliers de
société de secours ou de particuliers,
de navires de commerce, yachts et
embarcations, quelle que soit la nationalité
de ces bâtiments.</p>

<p class="center">Article 13.</p>

<p>Si des blessés, malades ou naufragés
sont recueillis à bord d'un vaisseau de
guerre neutre, il devra être pourvu,
dans la mesure du possible, à ce qu'ils
ne puissent pas de nouveau prendre
part aux opérations de la guerre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 14.</p>

<p>Sont prisonniers de guerre les naufragés,
blessés ou malades d'un belligérant,
qui tombent au pouvoir de
l'autre. Il appartient à celui-ci de
décider, suivant les circonstances, s'il
convient de les garder, de les diriger
sur un port de sa nation, sur un port
neutre ou même sur un port de l'adversaire.
Dans ce dernier cas, les
prisonniers ainsi rendus à leur pays ne
pourront servir pendant la durée de la
guerre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 15.</p>

<p>Les naufragés, blessés ou malades,
qui sont débarqués dans un port
neutre, du consentement de l'autorité
locale, devront, à moins d'un arrangement
contraire de l'État neutre avec
les États belligérants, être gardés par
l'État neutre de manière qu'ils ne
puissent pas de nouveau prendre part
aux opérations de la guerre.</p>

<p>Les frais d'hospitalisation et d'internement
seront supportés par l'État
dont relèvent les naufragés, blessés ou
malades.</p>

<p class="center">Article 16.</p>

<p>Après chaque combat, les deux
Parties belligérantes, en tant que les
intérêts militaires le comportent, prendront
des mesures pour rechercher les
naufragés, les blessés et les malades et
pour les faire protéger, ainsi que les
morts, contre le pillage et les mauvais
traitements.</p>

<p>Elles veilleront à ce que l'inhumation,
l'immersion ou l'incinération des morts
soit précédée d'un examen attentif de
leurs cadavres.</p>

<p class="center">Article 17.</p>

<p>Chaque belligérant enverra, dès qu'il
sera possible, aux autorités de leur
pays, de leur marine ou de leur armée,
les marques ou pièces militaires d'identité
trouvées sur les morts et l'état
nominatif des blessés ou malades recueillis
par lui.</p>

<p>Les belligérants se tiendront réciproquement
au courant des internements
et des mutations, ainsi que des entrées
dans les hôpitaux et des décès survenus
parmi les blessés et malades en leur
pouvoir. Ils recueilleront tous les objets
d'un usage personnel, valeurs,
lettres, etc. qui seront trouvés dans les
vaisseaux capturés, ou délaissés par les
blessés ou malades décédés dans les
hôpitaux, pour les faire transmettre

<p class="center">Article premier.</p>

<p>La correspondance postale des
neutres ou des belligérants, quel que

trouvée en mer sur un navire neutre

saisie du navire, elle est expédiée avec

<p>L'inviolabilité de la correspondance

<p>Cette exemption cesse de leur être

<p>Les Puissances contractantes s'interdisent

<p>Il en est de même du capitaine et des

<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Titre I.</span>&mdash;<i>Dispositions générales.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article premier.</p>

<p>La validité de la capture d'un navire
de commerce ou de sa cargaison est,
s'il s'agit de propriétés neutres ou ennemies,
établie devant une juridiction
des prises conformément à la présente
Convention.</p>

<p class="center">Article 2.</p>

<p>La juridiction des prises est exercée
d'abord par les tribunaux de prises du
belligérant capteur.</p>

<p>Les décisions de ces tribunaux sont
prononcées en séance publique ou
notifiées d'office aux parties neutres ou
ennemies.</p>

<p class="center">Article 3.</p>

<p>Les décisions des tribunaux de prises
nationaux peuvent être l'objet d'un
recours devant la Cour internationale
des prises:</p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span>. lorsque la décision des tribunaux
nationaux concerne les propriétés
d'une Puissance ou d'un

des propriétés ennemies et qu'il
s'agit:</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>a</i>) de marchandises chargées sur
un navire neutre,</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>b</i>) d'un navire ennemi, qui
aurait été capturé dans les eaux
territoriales d'une Puissance
neutre, dans le cas où cette Puissance
n'aurait pas fait de cette
capture l'objet d'une réclamation
diplomatique,</p>

<p class="blockquot">(<i>c</i>) d'une réclamation fondée
sur l'allégation que la capture
aurait été effectuée en violation,
soit d'une disposition conventionnelle
en vigueur entre les Puissances
belligérantes, soit d'une
disposition légale édictée par le
belligérant capteur.</p>

<p>Le recours contre la décision des
tribunaux nationaux peut être fondé
sur ce que cette décision ne serait pas
justifiée, soit en fait, soit en droit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p>Le recours peut être exercé:</p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span>. par une Puissance neutre, si
la décision des tribunaux nationaux
a porté atteinte à ses propriétés ou
à celles de ses ressortissants (article
3&mdash;1<span class="topnum">o</span>) ou s'il est allégué que la capture
d'un navire ennemi a eu lieu
dans les eaux territoriales de cette
Puissance (article 3&mdash;2<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>b</i>);</p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span>. par un particulier neutre, si la
décision des tribunaux nationaux a
porté atteinte à ses propriétés (article
3&mdash;1<span class="topnum">o</span>), sous réserve toutefois du
droit de la Puissance dont il relève,
de lui interdire l'accès de la Cour ou
d'y agir elle-même en ses lieu et
place;</p>

<p class="blockquot">3<span class="topnum">o</span>. par un particulier relevant de
la Puissance ennemie, si la décision

atteinte à ses propriétés dans les
conditions visées à l'article 3&mdash;2<span class="topnum">o</span>, à
l'exception du cas prévu par
l'alinéa <i>b</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Article 5.</p>

<p>Le recours peut aussi être exercé,
dans les mêmes conditions qu'à l'article
précédent, par les ayants-droit, neutres
ou ennemis, du particulier auquel le
recours est accordé, et qui sont intervenus
devant la juridiction nationale.
Ces ayants-droit peuvent exercer individuellement
le recours dans la
mesure de leur intérêt.</p>

<p>Il en est de même des ayants-droit,
neutres ou ennemis, de la Puissance
neutre dont la propriété est en cause.</p>

<p class="center">Article 6.</p>

<p>Lorsque, conformément à l'article 3
ci-dessus, la Cour internationale est
compétente, le droit de juridiction des
tribunaux nationaux ne peut être
exercé à plus de deux degrés. Il appartient
à la législation du belligérant
capteur de décider si le recours est
ouvert après la décision rendue en
premier ressort ou seulement après la
décision rendue en appel ou en cassation.</p>

<p>Faute par les tribunaux nationaux
d'avoir rendu une décision définitive
dans les deux ans à compter du jour
de la capture, la Cour peut être saisie
directement.</p>

<p class="center">Article 7.</p>

<p>Si la question de droit à résoudre est
prévue par une Convention en vigueur
entre le belligérant capteur et la Puissance
qui est elle-même partie au litige
ou dont le ressortissant est partie au
litige, la Cour se conforme aux stipulations
de ladite Convention.</p>

<p>A défaut de telles stipulations, la
Cour applique les règles du droit international.
Si des règles généralement
reconnues n'existent pas, la Cour statue
d'après les principes généraux de la
justice et de l'équité.</p>

<p>Les dispositions ci-dessus sont également
applicables en ce qui concerne
l'ordre des preuves ainsi que les moyens
qui peuvent être employés.</p>

<p>Si, conformément à l'article 3&mdash;2<span class="topnum">o</span> c,
le recours est fondé sur la violation
d'une disposition légale édictée par le
belligérant capteur, la Cour applique
cette disposition.</p>

<p>La Cour peut ne pas tenir compte
des déchéances de procédure édictées
par la législation du belligérant capteur,
dans les cas où elle estime que les
conséquences en sont contraires à la
justice et à l'équité.</p>

<p class="center">Article 8.</p>

<p>Si la Cour prononce la validité de
la capture du navire ou de la cargaison,
il en sera disposé conformément aux
lois du belligérant capteur.</p>

<p>Si la nullité de la capture est prononcée,
la Cour ordonne la restitution
du navire ou de la cargaison et fixe,
s'il y a lieu, le montant des dommages-intérêts.
Si le navire ou la cargaison
ont été vendus ou détruits, la Cour
détermine l'indemnité à accorder de ce
chef au propriétaire.</p>

<p>Si la nullité de la capture avait été
prononcée par la juridiction nationale,
la Cour n'est appelée à statuer que sur
les dommages et intérêts.</p>

2), d'après la date de leur entrée en
fonctions. La préséance appartient au
plus âgé, au cas où la date est la même.</p>

<p>Les juges suppléants sont, dans
l'exercice de leurs fonctions, assimilés
aux juges titulaires. Toutefois ils
prennent rang après ceux-ci.</p>

<p class="center">Article 13.</p>

<p>Les juges jouissent des privilèges et
immunités diplomatiques dans l'exercice
de leurs fonctions et en dehors de

<p>Avant de prendre possession de leur
siège, les juges doivent, devant le
Conseil administratif, prêter serment
ou faire une affirmation solennelle
d'exercer leurs fonctions avec impartialité
et en toute conscience.</p>

<p class="center">Article 14.</p>

<p>La Cour fonctionne au nombre de

le quorum nécessaire.</p>

<p>Le juge absent ou empêché est
remplacé par le suppléant.</p>

<p class="center">Article 15.</p>

<p>Les juges nommés par les Puissances

<p class="center">Article 16.</p>

<p>Si une Puissance belligérante n'a
pas, d'après le tour de rôle, un juge
siégeant dans la Cour, elle peut demander
que le juge nommé par elle
prenne part au jugement de toutes les
affaires provenant de la guerre. Dans
ce cas, le sort détermine lequel des
juges siégeant en vertu du tour de rôle
doit s'abstenir. Cette exclusion ne

<p>Aucun juge, titulaire ou suppléant,
ne peut intervenir comme agent ou

La même faculté appartient à la Puissance
neutre, qui est elle-même partie
au litige, ou à la Puissance dont le ressortissant

par application de cette dernière disposition,
plusieurs Puissances intéressées,
elles doivent se concerter, au besoin
par le sort, sur l'officier à désigner.</p>

<p class="center">Article 19.</p>

<p>La Cour élit son Président et son
Vice-Président à la majorité absolue

<p>Ces allocations, comprises dans les
frais généraux de la Cour prévus par

<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Titre III.</span>&mdash;<i>Procédure devant la Cour
internationale des prises.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 28.</p>

<p>Le recours devant la Cour internationale
des prises est formé au
moyen d'une déclaration écrite, faite
devant le tribunal national qui a statué,
ou adressée au Bureau international;
celui-ci peut être saisi même par télégramme.</p>

<p>Le délai du recours est fixé à cent
vingt jours à dater du jour où la décision
a été prononcée ou notifiée
(article 2 alinéa 2).</p>

<p class="center">Article 29.</p>

<p>Si la déclaration de recours est faite
devant le tribunal national, celui-ci,
sans examiner si le délai a été observé,
fait, dans les sept jours qui suivent,
expédier le dossier de l'affaire au
Bureau international.</p>

<p>Si la déclaration de recours est adressée
au Bureau international, celui-ci
en prévient directement le tribunal
national, par télégramme s'il est possible.
Le tribunal transmettra le
dossier comme il est dit à l'alinéa
précédent.</p>

<p>Lorsque le recours est formé par un
particulier neutre, le Bureau international
en avise immédiatement par
télégramme la Puissance dont relève
le particulier, pour permettre à cette
Puissance de faire valoir le droit que
lui reconnaît l'article 4&mdash;2<span class="topnum">o</span>.</p>

<p class="center">Article 30.</p>

<p>Dans le cas prévu à l'article 6 alinéa
2, le recours ne peut être adressé qu'au
Bureau international. Il doit être introduit
dans les trente jours qui suivent
l'expiration du délai de deux ans.</p>

<p class="center">Article 31.</p>

<p>Faute d'avoir formé son recours dans
le délai fixé à l'article 28 ou à l'article
30, la partie sera, sans débats, déclarée
non recevable.</p>

<p>Toutefois, si elle justifie d'un empêchement
de force majeure et si elle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
a formé son recours dans les soixante
jours qui ont suivi la cessation de cet
empêchement, elle peut être relevée de
la déchéance encourue, la partie adverse
ayant été dûment entendue.</p>

<p class="center">Article 32.</p>

<p>Si le recours a été formé en temps
utile, la Cour notifie d'office et sans
délai à la partie adverse une copie
certifiée conforme de la déclaration.</p>

<p class="center">Article 33.</p>

<p>Si, en dehors des parties qui se sont
pourvues devant la Cour, il y a d'autres
intéressés ayant le droit d'exercer le
recours, ou si, dans le cas prévu à
l'article 29 alinéa 3, la Puissance qui
a été avisée, n'a pas fait connaître sa
résolution, la Cour attend, pour se saisir
de l'affaire, que les délais prévus à
l'article 28 ou à l'article 30 soient
expirés.</p>

<p class="center">Article 34.</p>

<p>La procédure devant la Cour internationale
comprend deux phases distinctes:
l'instruction écrite et les
débats oraux.</p>

<p>L'instruction écrite consiste dans le
dépôt et l'échange d'exposés, de contre-exposés
et, au besoin, de répliques dont
l'ordre et les délais sont fixés par la
Cour. Les parties y joignent toutes
pièces et documents dont elles comptent
se servir.</p>

<p>Toute pièce, produite par une partie,
doit être communiquée en copie certifiée
conforme à l'autre partie par
l'intermédiaire de la Cour.</p>

<p class="center">Article 35.</p>

<p>L'instruction écrite étant terminée,
il y a lieu à une audience publique,
dont le jour est fixé par la Cour.</p>

<p>Dans cette audience, les parties exposent
l'état de l'affaire en fait et en
droit.</p>

<p>La Cour peut, en tout état de cause,
suspendre les plaidoiries, soit à la demande
d'une des parties, soit d'office,
pour procéder à une information complémentaire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 36.</p>

<p>La Cour internationale peut ordonner
que l'information complémentaire aura
lieu, soit conformément aux dispositions
de l'article 27, soit directement
devant elle ou devant un ou plusieurs
de ses membres en tant que cela peut
se faire sans moyen coercitif ou comminatoire.</p>

<p>Si des mesures d'information doivent
être prises par des membres de la Cour
en dehors du territoire où elle a son
siège, l'assentiment du Gouvernement
étranger doit être obtenu.</p>

<p class="center">Article 37.</p>

<p>Les parties sont appelées à assister
à toutes mesures d'instruction. Elles
reçoivent une copie certifiée conforme
des procès-verbaux.</p>

<p class="center">Article 38.</p>

<p>Les débats sont dirigés par le Président
ou le Vice-Président et, en cas
d'absence ou d'empêchement de l'un
et de l'autre, par le plus ancien des
juges présents.</p>

<p>Le juge nommé par une partie belligérante
ne peut siéger comme Président.</p>

<p class="center">Article 39.</p>

<p>Les débats sont publics sauf le droit
pour une Puissance en litige de demander
qu'il y soit procédé à huis clos.</p>

<p>Ils sont consignés dans des procès-verbaux,
que signent le Président et le
greffier et qui seuls ont caractère
authentique.</p>

<p class="center">Article 40.</p>

<p>En cas de non comparution d'une
des parties, bien que régulièrement
citée, ou faute par elle d'agir dans les
délais fixés par la Cour, il est procédé
sans elle et la Cour décide d'après les
éléments d'appréciation qu'elle a à sa
disposition.</p>

<p class="center">Article 41.</p>

<p>La Cour notifie d'office aux parties
toutes décisions ou ordonnances prises
en leur absence.</p>

<p class="center">Article 42.</p>

<p>La Cour apprécie librement l'ensemble
des actes, preuves et déclarations
orales.</p>

<p class="center">Article 43.</p>

<p>Les délibérations de la Cour ont lieu
à huis clos et restent secrètes.</p>

<p>Toute décision est prise à la majorité
des juges présents. Si la Cour siège en
nombre pair et qu'il y ait partage des
voix, la voix du dernier des juges dans
l'ordre de préséance établi d'après
l'article 12 alinéa 1 n'est pas comptée.</p>

<p>L'arrêt de la Cour doit être motivé.
Il mentionne les noms des juges qui y
ont participé, ainsi que les noms des
assesseurs, s'il y a lieu; il est signé par
le Président et par le greffier.</p>

<p class="center">Article 45.</p>

<p>L'arrêt est prononcé en séance publique,

parties.</p>

<p>Cette notification une fois faite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[Pg 627]</a></span>
la Cour fait parvenir au tribunal
national des prises le dossier de
l'affaire en y joignant une expédition
des diverses décisions intervenues ainsi
qu'une copie des procès-verbaux de
l'instruction.</p>

<p class="center">Article 46.</p>

<p>Chaque partie supporte les frais
occasionnés par sa propre défense.</p>

<p>La partie qui succombe supporte, en
outre, les frais causés par la procédure.
Elle doit, de plus, verser un centième
de la valeur de l'objet litigieux à titre
de contribution aux frais généraux de
la Cour internationale. Le montant
de ces versements est déterminé par
l'arrêt de la Cour.</p>

<p>Si le recours est exercé par un particulier,
celui-ci fournit au Bureau
international un cautionnement dont
le montant est fixé par la Cour et qui
est destiné à garantir l'exécution éventuelle
des deux obligations mentionnées
dans l'alinéa précédent. La Cour peut
subordonner l'ouverture de la procédure
au versement du cautionnement.</p>

<p class="center">Article 47.</p>

<p>Les frais généraux de la Cour internationale
des prises sont supportés par
les Puissances contractantes dans la
proportion de leur participation au
fonctionnement de la Cour telle qu'elle
est prévue par l'article 15 et par le
tableau y annexé. La désignation des
juges suppléants ne donne pas lieu à
contribution.</p>

<p>Le Conseil administratif s'adresse
aux Puissances pour obtenir les fonds
nécessaires au fonctionnement de la
Cour.</p>

<p class="center">Article 48.</p>

<p>Quand la Cour n'est pas en session,
les fonctions qui lui sont conférées par
l'article 32, l'article 34 alinéas 2 et 3,
l'article 35 alinéa 1 et l'article 46
alinéa 3, sont exercées par une Délégation
de trois juges désignés par la
Cour. Cette Délégation décide à la
majorité des voix.</p>

<p class="center">Article 49.</p>

<p>La Cour fait elle-même son règlement

<p>Dans l'année de la ratification de la

pour élaborer ce règlement.</p>

<p class="center">Article 50.</p>

<p>La Cour peut proposer des modifications
à apporter aux dispositions de la
présente Convention qui concernent la
procédure. Ces propositions sont communiquées,
par l'intermédiaire du

contractantes qui se concerteront
sur la suite à y donner.</p>

<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Titre IV.</span>&mdash;<i>Dispositions finales.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 51.</p>

<p>La présente Convention ne s'applique
de plein droit que si les Puissances belligérantes
sont toutes parties à la Convention.</p>

<p>Il est entendu, en outre, que le
recours devant la Cour internationale
des prises ne peut être exercé que par
une Puissance contractante ou le ressortissant
d'une Puissance contractante.</p>

<p>Dans les cas de l'article 5, le recours
n'est admis que si le propriétaire et
l'ayant-droit sont également des Puissances
contractantes ou des ressortissants
de Puissances contractantes.</p>

<p class="center">Article 52.</p>

<p>La présente Convention sera ratifiée
et les ratifications en seront déposées
à La Haye dès que toutes les Puissances
désignées à l'article 15 et dans son
annexe seront en mesure de le faire.</p>

<p>Le dépôt des ratifications aura lieu
en tout cas, le 30 juin 1909, si les
Puissances prêtes à ratifier peuvent
fournir à la Cour neuf juges et neuf
juges suppléants, aptes à siéger effectivement.
Dans le cas contraire, le
dépôt sera ajourné jusqu'au moment
où cette condition sera remplie.</p>

<p>Il sera dressé du dépôt des ratifications
un procès-verbal dont une copie,
certifiée conforme, sera remise par la
voie diplomatique à chacune des Puissances
désignées à l'alinéa premier.</p>

<p class="center">Article 53.</p>

<p>Les Puissances désignées à l'article 15
et dans son annexe sont admises à
signer la présente Convention jusqu'au
dépôt des ratifications prévu par
l'alinéa 2 de l'article précédent.</p>

<p>Après ce dépôt, elles seront toujours
admises à y adhérer, purement et simplement.
La Puissance qui désire
adhérer notifie par écrit son intention
au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas en lui
transmettant, en même temps, l'acte
d'adhésion qui sera déposé dans les
archives dudit Gouvernement. Celui-ci
enverra, par la voie diplomatique,
une copie certifiée conforme de la notification
et de l'acte d'adhésion à toutes
les Puissances désignées à l'alinéa précédent,
en leur faisant savoir la date où
il a reçu la notification.</p>

<p class="center">Article 54.</p>

<p>La présente Convention entrera en

ratifications prévu par l'article 52
alinéas 1 et 2.</p>

<p>Les adhésions produiront effet soixante
jours après que la notification en
aura été reçue par le Gouvernement
des Pays-Bas et, au plus tôt, à l'expiration
du délai prévu par l'alinéa
précédent.</p>

<p>Toutefois, la Cour internationale aura
qualité pour juger les affaires de prises
décidées par la juridiction nationale à
partir du dépôt des ratifications ou de
la réception de la notification des adhésions.
Pour ces décisions, le délai
fixé à l'article 28 alinéa 2, ne sera
compté que de la date de la mise en
vigueur de la Convention pour les
Puissances ayant ratifié ou adhéré.</p>

<p class="center">Article 55.</p>

<p>La présente Convention aura une
durée de douze ans à partir de sa mise
en vigueur, telle qu'elle est déterminée
par l'article 54 alinéa 1, même pour les
Puissances ayant adhéré postérieurement.</p>

<p>Elle sera renouvelée tacitement de
six ans en six ans sauf dénonciation.</p>

<p>La dénonciation devra être, au moins
un an avant l'expiration de chacune
des périodes prévues par les deux
alinéas précédents, notifiée par écrit
au Gouvernement des Pays-Bas qui
en donnera connaissance à toutes les
autres Parties contractantes.</p>

<p>La dénonciation ne produira ses effets
qu'à l'égard de la Puissance qui l'aura
notifiée. La Convention subsistera
pour les autres Puissances contractantes,
pourvu que leur participation à
la désignation des juges soit suffisante
pour permettre le fonctionnement de
la Cour avec neuf juges et neuf juges
suppléants.</p>

<p class="center">Article 56.</p>

<p>Dans le cas où la présente Convention
n'est pas en vigueur pour toutes
les Puissances désignées dans l'article
15 et le tableau qui s'y rattache, le
Conseil administratif dresse, conformément
aux dispositions de cet article et de
ce tableau, la liste des juges et des juges
suppléants pour lesquels les Puissances
contractantes participent au fonctionnement
de la Cour. Les juges appelés
à siéger à tour de rôle seront, pour le
temps qui leur est attribué par le
tableau susmentionné, répartis entre les
différentes années de la période de six
ans, de manière que, dans la mesure du
possible, la Cour fonctionne chaque
année en nombre égal. Si le nombre
des juges suppléants dépasse celui des
juges, le nombre de ces derniers pourra
être complété par des juges suppléants
désignés par le sort parmi celles des
Puissances qui ne nomment pas de
juge titulaire.</p>

<p>La liste ainsi dressée par le Conseil
administratif sera notifiée aux Puissances
contractantes. Elle sera révisée
quand le nombre de celles-ci sera
modifié par suite d'adhésions ou de
dénonciations.</p>

<p>Le changement à opérer par suite
d'une adhésion ne se produira qu'à
partir du 1<span class="topnum">er</span> janvier qui suit la date à
laquelle l'adhésion a son effet, à moins
que la Puissance adhérente ne soit une
Puissance belligérante, cas auquel elle
peut demander d'être aussitôt représentée
dans la Cour, la disposition de
l'article 16 étant du reste applicable,
s'il y a lieu.</p>

<p>Quand le nombre total des juges est
inférieur à onze, sept juges constituent
le quorum nécessaire.</p>


<p class="center">Article 57.</p>

<p>Deux ans avant l'expiration de
chaque période visée par les alinéas
1 et 2 de l'article 55, chaque Puissance
contractante pourra demander une
modification des dispositions de l'article
15 et du tableau y annexé, relativement
à sa participation au fonctionnement
de la Cour. La demande sera
adressée au Conseil administratif qui
l'examinera et soumettra à toutes les
Puissances des propositions sur la suite
à y donner. Les Puissances feront,
dans le plus bref délai possible, connaître
leur résolution au Conseil administratif.
Le résultat sera immédiatement,
et au moins un an et trente
jours avant l'expiration dudit délai de
deux ans, communiqué à la Puissance
qui a fait la demande.</p>

<p>Le cas échéant, les modifications
adoptées par les Puissances entreront
en vigueur dès le commencement de
la nouvelle période.</p>

<h4>
<span>CONVENTION XIII.</span>
<span class="smcap">Convention concerning the Rights and duties
 of Neutral Powers in Maritime War.</span>
</h4>

<p class="center">Article premier.</p>

<p>Les belligérants sont tenus de respecter
les droits souverains des Puissances
neutres et de s'abstenir, dans le
territoire ou les eaux neutres, de tous
actes qui constitueraient de la part
des Puissances qui les toléreraient un
manquement à leur neutralité.</p>


<p class="center">Article 2.</p>

<p>Tous actes d'hostilité, y compris la
capture et l'exercice du droit de visite,
commis par des vaisseaux de guerre
belligérants dans les eaux territoriales
d'une Puissance neutre, constituent
une violation de la neutralité et sont
strictement interdits.</p>


<p class="center">Article 3.</p>

<p>Quand un navire a été capturé dans
les eaux territoriales d'une Puissance
neutre, cette Puissance doit, si la prise
est encore dans sa juridiction, user des
moyens dont elle dispose pour que la
prise soit relâchée avec ses officiers et
son équipage, et pour que l'équipage
mis à bord par le capteur soit interné.</p>

<p>Si la prise est hors de la juridiction
de la Puissance neutre, le Gouvernement
capteur, sur la demande de celle-ci,
doit relâcher la prise avec ses officiers
et son équipage.</p>

<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p>Aucun tribunal des prises ne peut
être constitué par un belligérant sur
un territoire neutre ou sur un navire
dans des eaux neutres.</p>

<p class="center">Article 5.</p>

<p>Il est interdit aux belligérants de
faire des ports et des eaux neutres la
base d'opérations navales contre leurs
adversaires, notamment d'y installer
des stations radio-télégraphiques ou
tout appareil destiné à servir comme
moyen de communication avec des
forces belligérantes sur terre ou sur mer.</p>

<p class="center">Article 6.</p>

<p>La remise à quelque titre que ce soit,
faite directement ou indirectement par
une Puissance neutre à une Puissance
belligérante, de vaisseaux de guerre,
de munitions, ou d'un matériel de
guerre quelconque, est interdite.</p>

<p class="center">Article 7.</p>

<p>Une Puissance neutre n'est pas tenue
d'empêcher l'exportation ou le transit,
pour le compte de l'un ou de l'autre des
belligérants, d'armes, de munitions, et,
en général, de tout ce qui peut être
utile à une armée ou à une flotte.</p>

<p class="center">Article 8.</p>

<p>Un Gouvernement neutre est tenu
d'user des moyens dont il dispose pour
empêcher dans sa juridiction l'équipement
ou l'armement de tout navire,
qu'il a des motifs raisonnables de
croire destiné à croiser ou à concourir
à des opérations hostiles contre une
Puissance avec laquelle il est en paix.
Il est aussi tenu d'user de la même
surveillance pour empêcher le départ
hors de sa juridiction de tout navire
destiné à croiser ou à concourir à des
opérations hostiles, et qui aurait été,
dans ladite juridiction, adapté en tout
ou en partie à des usages de guerre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 9.</p>

<p>Une Puissance neutre doit appliquer
également aux deux belligérants les
conditions, restrictions ou interdictions,
édictées par elle pour ce qui concerne
l'admission dans ses ports, rades ou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[Pg 630]</a></span>
eaux territoriales, des navires de guerre
belligérants ou de leurs prises.</p>

<p>Toutefois, une Puissance neutre peut
interdire l'accès de ses ports et de ses
rades au navire belligérant qui aurait
négligé de se conformer aux ordres et
prescriptions édictés par elle ou qui
aurait violé la neutralité.</p>

<p class="center">Article 10.</p>

<p>La neutralité d'une Puissance n'est
pas compromise par le simple passage
dans ses eaux territoriales de navires
de guerre et des prises des belligérants.</p>

<p class="center">Article 11.</p>

<p>Une Puissance neutre peut laisser les
navires de guerre des belligérants se
servir de ses pilotes brevetés.</p>

<p class="center">Article 12.</p>

<p>A défaut d'autres dispositions spéciales
de la législation de la Puissance
neutre, il est interdit aux navires de
guerre des belligérants de demeurer
dans les ports et rades ou dans les eaux
territoriales de ladite Puissance, pendant
plus de 24 heures, sauf dans les
cas prévus par la présente Convention.</p>

<p class="center">Article 13.</p>

<p>Si une Puissance avisée de l'ouverture
des hostilités apprend qu'un
navire de guerre d'un belligérant se
trouve dans un de ses ports et rades
ou dans ses eaux territoriales, elle doit
notifier audit navire qu'il devra partir
dans les 24 heures ou dans le délai
prescrit par la loi locale.</p>

<p class="center">Article 14.</p>

<p>Un navire de guerre belligérant ne
peut prolonger son séjour dans un port
neutre au delà de la durée légale que
pour cause d'avaries ou à raison de
l'état de la mer. Il devra partir dès
que la cause du retard aura cessé.</p>

<p>Les règles sur la limitation du séjour
dans les ports, rades et eaux neutres,
ne s'appliquent pas aux navires de
guerre exclusivement affectés à une
mission religieuse, scientifique ou philanthropique.</p>

<p class="center">Article 15.</p>

<p>A défaut d'autres dispositions spéciales
de la législation de la Puissance
neutre, le nombre maximum des navires
de guerre d'un belligérant qui pourront
se trouver en même temps dans un de
ses ports ou rades, sera de trois.</p>

<p class="center">Article 16.</p>

<p>Lorsque des navires de guerre des
deux parties belligérantes se trouvent
simultanément dans un port ou une
rade neutres, il doit s'écouler au moins
24 heures entre le départ du navire
d'un belligérant et le départ du navire
de l'autre.</p>

<p>L'ordre des départs est déterminé
par l'ordre des arrivées, à moins que
le navire arrivé le premier ne soit dans
le cas où la prolongation de la durée
légale du séjour est admise.</p>

<p>Un navire de guerre belligérant ne
peut quitter un port ou une rade
neutres moins de 24 heures après le
départ d'un navire de commerce portant
le pavillon de son adversaire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 17.</p>

<p>Dans les ports et rades neutres, les
navires de guerre belligérants ne peuvent
réparer leurs avaries que dans la
mesure indispensable à la sécurité de
leur navigation et non pas accroître,
d'une manière quelconque, leur force
militaire. L'autorité neutre constatera
la nature des réparations à effectuer qui
devront être exécutées le plus rapidement
possible.</p>

<p class="center">Article 18.</p>

<p>Les navires de guerre belligérants ne
peuvent pas se servir des ports, rades
et eaux territoriales neutres, pour renouveler
ou augmenter leurs approvisionnements
militaires ou leur armement
ainsi que pour compléter leurs
équipages.</p>

<p class="center">Article 19.</p>

<p>Les navires de guerre belligérants ne
peuvent se ravitailler dans les ports et
rades neutres que pour compléter leur
approvisionnement normal du temps
de paix.</p>

<p>Ces navires ne peuvent, de même,
prendre du combustible que pour gagner
le port le plus proche de leur propre
pays. Ils peuvent, d'ailleurs, prendre
le combustible nécessaire pour compléter
le plein de leurs soutes proprement
dites, quand ils se trouvent dans
les pays neutres qui ont adopté ce mode
de détermination du combustible à
fournir.</p>

<p>Si, d'après la loi de la Puissance
neutre, les navires ne reçoivent du
charbon que 24 heures après leur arrivée,
la durée légale de leur séjour est
prolongée de 24 heures.</p>

<p class="center">Article 20.</p>

<p>Les navires de guerre belligérants,
qui ont pris du combustible dans le
port d'une Puissance neutre, ne peuvent
renouveler leur approvisionnement
qu'après trois mois dans un port
de la même Puissance.</p>

<p class="center">Article 21.</p>

<p>Une prise ne peut être amenée dans
un port neutre que pour cause d'innavigabilité,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[Pg 631]</a></span>
de mauvais état de la
mer, de manque de combustible ou de
provisions.</p>

<p>Elle doit repartir aussitôt que la
cause qui en a justifié l'entrée a cessé.
Si elle ne le fait pas, la Puissance
neutre doit lui notifier l'ordre de partir
immédiatement; au cas où elle ne s'y
conformerait pas, la Puissance neutre
doit user des moyens dont elle dispose
pour la relâcher avec ses officiers et son
équipage et interner l'équipage mis à
bord par le capteur.</p>

<p class="center">Article 22.</p>

<p>La Puissance neutre doit, de même,
relâcher la prise qui aurait été amenée
en dehors des conditions prévues par
l'article 21.</p>

<p class="center">Article 23.</p>

<p>Une Puissance neutre peut permettre
l'accès de ses ports et rades aux prises
escortées ou non, lorsqu'elles y sont
amenées pour être laissées sous séquestre
en attendant la décision du
tribunal des prises. Elle peut faire
conduire la prise dans un autre de ses
ports.</p>

<p>Si la prise est escortée par un navire
de guerre, les officiers et les hommes
mis à bord par le capteur sont autorisés
à passer sur le navire d'escorte.</p>

<p>Si la prise voyage seule, le personnel
placé à son bord par le capteur est
laissé en liberté.</p>

<p class="center">Article 24.</p>

<p>Si, malgré la notification de l'autorité
neutre, un navire de guerre belligérant
ne quitte pas un port dans lequel il n'a
pas le droit de rester, la Puissance
neutre a le droit de prendre les mesures
qu'elle pourra juger nécessaires pour
rendre le navire incapable de prendre la
mer pendant la durée de la guerre et
le commandant du navire doit faciliter
l'exécution de ces mesures.</p>

<p>Lorsqu'un navire belligérant est retenu
par une Puissance neutre, les
officiers et l'équipage sont également
retenus.</p>

<p>Les officiers et l'équipage ainsi retenus
peuvent être laissés dans le navire
ou logés, soit sur un autre navire, soit
à terre, et ils peuvent être assujettis
aux mesures restrictives qu'il paraîtrait
nécessaire de leur imposer. Toutefois,
on devra toujours laisser sur le navire
les hommes nécessaires à son entretien.</p>

<p>Les officiers peuvent être laissés
libres en prenant l'engagement sur
parole de ne pas quitter le territoire
neutre sans autorisation.</p>

<p class="center">Article 25.</p>

<p>Une Puissance neutre est tenue
d'exercer la surveillance, que comportent
les moyens dont elle dispose, pour
empêcher dans ses ports ou rades et
dans ses eaux toute violation des dispositions
qui précèdent.</p>

<p class="center">Article 26.</p>

<p>L'exercice par une Puissance neutre
des droits définis par la présente Convention
ne peut jamais être considéré
comme un acte peu amical par l'un ou
par l'autre belligérant qui a accepté les
articles qui s'y réfèrent.</p>

<p class="center">Article 27.</p>

<p>Les Puissances contractantes se communiqueront
réciproquement, en temps
utile, toutes les lois, ordonnances et
autres dispositions réglant chez elles le
régime des navires de guerre belligérants
dans leurs ports et leurs eaux, au
moyen d'une notification adressée au
Gouvernement des Pays-Bas et transmise
immédiatement par celui-ci aux
autres Puissances contractantes.</p>

<p class="center">Article 28.</p>

<p>Les dispositions de la présente Convention
ne sont applicables qu'entre les
Puissances contractantes et seulement
si les belligérants sont tous parties à la
Convention.</p>

aussitôt que possible.</p>

<p>Les ratifications seront déposées à

pour une période allant jusqu'à
la fin de la troisième Conférence de la
Paix, à l'interdiction de lancer des

de ballons ou par d'autres modes analogues
nouveaux.</p>

<p>La présente Déclaration n'est obligatoire
que pour les Puissances contractantes,
en cas de guerre entre deux
ou plusieurs d'entre elles.</p>

<p>Elle cessera d'être obligatoire du
moment où, dans une guerre entre des
Puissances contractantes, une Puissance
non contractante se joindrait à
l'un des belligérants.</p>

<p>La présente Déclaration sera ratifiée
dans le plus bref délai possible.</p>

<p class="center1"><span class="smcap">Titre I.</span>&mdash;<i>Organisation de la Cour
de justice arbitrale.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article premier.</p>

<p>Dans le but de faire progresser la cause
de l'arbitrage, les Puissances contractantes
conviennent d'organiser, sans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
porter atteinte à la Cour permanente
d'arbitrage, une Cour de justice arbitrale,
d'un accès libre et facile, basée sur
l'égalité juridique des États, réunissant
des juges représentant les divers systèmes
juridiques du monde, et capable
d'assurer la continuité de la jurisprudence
arbitrale.</p>


<p class="center">Article 2.</p>

<p>La Cour de justice arbitrale se compose
de juges et de juges suppléants
choisis parmi les personnes jouissant
de la plus haute considération morale
et qui tous devront remplir les conditions
requises, dans leurs pays respectifs,
pour l'admission dans la haute
magistrature ou être des jurisconsultes
d'une compétence notoire en matière
de droit international.</p>

<p>Les juges et les juges suppléants de
la Cour sont choisis, autant que possible,
parmi les membres de la Cour
permanente d'arbitrage. Le choix
sera fait dans les six mois qui suivront
la ratification de la présente Convention.</p>


<p class="center">Article 3.</p>

<p>Les juges et les juges suppléants sont
nommés pour une période de douze ans
à compter de la date où la nomination
aura été notifiée au Conseil administratif
institué par la Convention pour
le règlement pacifique des conflits
internationaux. Leur mandat peut
être renouvelé.</p>

<p>En cas de décès ou de démission d'un
juge ou d'un juge suppléant, il est
pourvu à son remplacement selon le
mode fixé pour sa nomination. Dans
ce cas, la nomination est faite pour une
nouvelle période de douze ans.</p>


<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p>Les juges de la Cour de justice arbitrale
sont égaux entre eux et prennent
rang d'après la date de la notification
de leur nomination. La préséance appartient
au plus âgé, au cas où la date
est la même.</p>

<p>Les juges suppléants sont, dans
l'exercice de leurs fonctions, assimilés
aux juges titulaires. Toutefois, ils
prennent rang après ceux-ci.</p>


<p class="center">Article 5.</p>

<p>Les juges jouissent des privilèges et
immunités diplomatiques dans l'exercice
de leurs fonctions et en dehors de
leurs pays.</p>

<p>Avant de prendre possession de leur
siège, les juges et les juges suppléants
doivent, devant le Conseil administratif,
prêter serment ou faire une
affirmation solennelle d'exercer leurs
fonctions avec impartialité et en toute
conscience.</p>


<p class="center">Article 6.</p>

<p>La Cour désigne annuellement trois
juges qui forment une Délégation
spéciale et trois autres destinés à les
remplacer en cas d'empêchement. Ils
peuvent être réélus. L'élection se fait
au scrutin de liste. Sont considérés
comme élus ceux qui réunissent le
plus grand nombre de voix. La Délégation
élit elle-même son Président,
qui, à défaut d'une majorité, est désigné
par le sort.</p>

<p>Un membre de la Délégation ne peut
exercer ses fonctions quand la Puissance
qui l'a nommé, ou dont il est le
national, est une des Parties.</p>

<p>Les membres de la Délégation terminent
les affaires qui leur ont été
soumises, même au cas où la période
pour laquelle ils ont été nommés juges
serait expirée.</p>


<p class="center">Article 7.</p>

<p>L'exercice des fonctions judiciaires
est interdit au juge dans les affaires au
sujet desquelles il aura, à un titre
quelconque, concouru à la décision d'un
Tribunal national, d'un Tribunal d'arbitrage
ou d'une Commission d'enquête,
ou figuré dans l'instance comme
conseil ou avocat d'une Partie.</p>

<p>Aucun juge ne peut intervenir
comme agent ou comme avocat devant
la Cour de justice arbitrale ou la Cour
permanente d'arbitrage, devant un
Tribunal spécial d'arbitrage ou une
Commission d'enquête, ni y agir pour
une Partie en quelque qualité que ce
soit, pendant toute la durée de son
mandat.</p>


<p class="center">Article 8.</p>

<p>La Cour élit son Président et son
Vice-Président à la majorité absolue
des suffrages exprimés. Après deux
tours de scrutin, l'élection se fait à la
majorité relative et, en cas de partage

<p>Disposition Préliminaire.</p>

<p><i>Les Puissances Signataires sont d'accord
pour constater que les règles contenues
dans les Chapitres suivants répondent,
en substance, aux principes
généralement reconnus du droit international.</i></p>

<p>Cette disposition domine toutes les
règles qui suivent. L'esprit en a été
indiqué dans les considérations générales
placées en tête de ce Rapport.
La Conférence a eu surtout en vue de
constater, de préciser, de compléter au
besoin, ce qui pouvait être considéré
comme un droit coutumier.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre Premier.</span>&mdash;<i>Du blocus en
temps de guerre.</i></p>

<p>Le blocus est envisagé ici uniquement
comme opération de guerre, et
l'on n'a entendu en rien toucher à ce
qu'on appelle le <i>blocus pacifique</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Article 1.</p>

<p><i>Le blocus doit être limité aux ports et
aux côtes de l'ennemi ou occupés par lui.</i></p>

<p>Le blocus, opération de guerre, ne
peut être dirigé par un belligérant que
contre son adversaire. C'est la règle
très simple qui est posée tout d'abord.
Elle n'a toute sa portée que si on la
rapproche de l'article 18.</p>

<p class="center">Article 2.</p>

<p><i>Conformément à la Déclaration de
Paris de 1856, le blocus, pour être obligatoire,
doit être effectif, c'est-à-dire
maintenu par une force suffisante pour
interdire réellement l'accès du littoral ennemi.</i></p>

<p>La première condition pour qu'un
blocus soit obligatoire est qu'il soit
effectif. Il y a longtemps que tout le
monde est d'accord à ce sujet. Quant
à la définition du blocus effectif, nous
avons pensé que nous n'avions qu'à
nous approprier celle qui se trouve dans
la Déclaration de Paris du 16 avril
1856, qui lie conventionnellement un
grand nombre d'États et qui est acceptée
de fait par les autres.</p>

<p class="center">Article 3.</p>

<p><i>La question de savoir si le blocus est
effectif est une question de fait.</i></p>

<p>On comprend que souvent des difficultés
s'élèvent sur le point de savoir
si un blocus est ou non effectif;
il y a en jeu des intérêts opposés. Le
belligérant bloquant veut limiter son
effort, et les neutres désirent que leur
commerce soit le moins gêné possible.
Des protestations diplomatiques ont été
parfois formulées à ce sujet. L'appréciation
peut être délicate, parce qu'il
n'y a pas de règle absolue à poser sur
le nombre et la situation des navires
de blocus. Tout dépend des circonstances
de fait, des conditions géographiques.
Suivant les cas, un navire
suffira pour bloquer un port aussi efficacement
que possible, alors qu'une
flotte pourra être insuffisante pour empêcher
réellement l'accès d'un ou de
plusieurs ports déclarés bloqués. C'est
donc essentiellement une <i>question de
fait</i>, à trancher dans chaque espèce,
et non d'après une formule arrêtée à
l'avance. Qui la tranchera? L'autorité
judiciaire. Ce sera d'abord le tribunal
national appelé à statuer sur la validité
de la prise, et auquel le navire capturé
pour violation de blocus pourra demander
de déclarer la nullité de la prise,
parce que le blocus, n'ayant pas été effectif,
n'était pas obligatoire. Ce recours
a toujours existé; il pouvait ne pas
donner une satisfaction suffisante aux
Puissances intéressées, parce qu'elles
pouvaient estimer que le tribunal national
était assez naturellement porté
à considérer comme effectif le blocus déclaré
tel par son Gouvernement. Mais,
quand la Convention sur la Cour Internationale
des Prises entrera en vigueur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
il y aura une juridiction absolument
impartiale à laquelle les neutres pourront
s'adresser et qui décidera si, dans
tel cas, le blocus était effectif ou
non. La possibilité de ce recours,
outre qu'elle permettra de réparer certaines
injustices, aura vraisemblablement
un effet préventif, en ce qu'un
Gouvernement se préoccupera d'établir
ses blocus de telle façon que l'effet ne
puisse pas en être annulé par des décisions
qui lui causeraient un grand préjudice.
L'article 3 a donc toute sa
portée, si on l'entend en ce sens que la
question prévue doit être tranchée judiciairement.
C'est pour écarter toute
équivoque que l'explication précédente
est insérée dans le Rapport à la demande
de la Commission.</p>

<p class="center">Article 4.</p>

<p><i>Le blocus n'est pas considéré comme
levé si, par suite du mauvais temps, les
forces bloquantes se sont momentanément
éloignées.</i></p>

<p>Il ne suffit pas que le blocus soit
établi; il faut qu'il soit maintenu.
S'il vient à être levé, il pourra être
repris, mais alors il exigera les mêmes
formalités que s'il était établi pour la
première fois. Traditionnellement, on
ne considère pas le blocus comme levé,
lorsque c'est par suite du mauvais
temps que les forces bloquantes se sont
momentanément éloignées. C'est ce
que dit l'article 4. Il doit être tenu
pour limitatif en ce sens que le mauvais
temps est le seul cas de force majeure
qui puisse être allégué. Si les forces
bloquantes s'éloignaient pour toute
autre cause, le blocus serait considéré
comme levé, et, au cas où il viendrait à
être repris, les articles 12 <i>in fine</i> et 13
seraient applicables.</p>

<p class="center">Article 5.</p>

<p><i>Le blocus doit être impartialement appliqué
aux divers pavillons.</i></p>

<p>Le blocus, opération de guerre légitime,
doit être respecté par les neutres
en tant qu'il reste vraiment une opération
de guerre ayant pour but d'interrompre
toutes les relations commerciales
du port bloqué. Ce ne peut être un
moyen pour un belligérant de favoriser
certains pavillons en les laissant passer.
C'est ce qu'indique l'article 5.</p>

<p class="center">Article 6.</p>

<p><i>Le commandant de la force bloquante
peut accorder à des navires de guerre la
permission d'entrer dans le port bloqué
et d'en sortir ultérieurement.</i></p>

<p>L'interdiction qui s'applique à tous
les navires de commerce, s'applique-t-elle
aussi aux navires de guerre? Il
n'y a pas de réponse absolue à faire.
Le commandant des forces de blocus
peut estimer qu'il a avantage à intercepter
toute communication de la place
bloquée, et refuser l'accès aux navires
de guerre neutres; rien ne lui est imposé.
S'il accorde l'entrée, c'est affaire
de courtoisie. Si on a consacré une
règle pour dire simplement cela, c'est
pour qu'on ne puisse pas prétendre que
le blocus a cessé d'être effectif par suite
de la permission accordée à tels et tels
navires de guerre neutres.</p>

<p>Le commandant du blocus doit agir
impartialement, comme il est dit dans
l'article 5. Toutefois, par cela seul
qu'il a laissé entrer un navire de guerre,
il ne peut être obligé de laisser passer
tous les navires de guerre neutres qui
se présenteront. C'est une question
d'appréciation. La présence d'un navire
de guerre neutre dans un port
bloqué peut ne pas avoir les mêmes
conséquences à toutes les phases du
blocus, et le commandant doit être
laissé maître de juger s'il peut être
courtois sans rien sacrifier de ses intérêts
militaires.</p>

<p class="center">Article 7.</p>

<p><i>Un navire neutre, en cas de détresse
constatée par une autorité des forces bloquantes,
peut pénétrer dans la localité
bloquée et en sortir ultérieurement à la
condition de n'y avoir laissé ni pris aucun
chargement.</i></p>

<p>La détresse peut expliquer l'entrée
d'un navire neutre dans la localité
bloquée. C'est, par exemple, un navire
qui manque de vivres ou d'eau, qui
a besoin d'une réparation immédiate.
Sa détresse une fois constatée par une
autorité de la force bloquante, il <i>peut</i>
franchir la ligne de blocus; ce n'est pas
une faveur qu'il ait à solliciter de l'humanité
ou de la courtoisie de l'autorité
bloquante. Celle-ci peut contester
l'état de détresse, mais, l'état une fois
vérifié, la conséquence suit d'elle-même.
Le navire qui aura ainsi pénétré dans le
port bloqué ne sera pas obligé d'y rester
tout le temps que durera le blocus; il
pourra en sortir quand il sera en état
de le faire, quand il se sera procuré les
vivres ou l'eau qui lui sont nécessaires,
quand il aura été réparé. Mais la permission
qui lui a été accordée n'a pu
servir de prétexte à des opérations commerciales;
c'est pour cela qu'on exige
qu'il n'ait laissé ou pris aucun chargement.</p>

<p>Il va sans dire que l'escadre de blocus,
qui voudrait absolument empêcher de
passer, pourrait le faire, si elle mettait
à la disposition du navire en détresse
les secours dont il a besoin.</p>

<p class="center">Article 8.</p>

<p><i>Le blocus, pour être obligatoire, doit
être déclaré conformément à l'article 9 et
notifié conformément aux articles 11 et 16.</i></p>

<p>Indépendamment de la condition
d'effectivité formulée par la Déclaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[Pg 639]</a></span>
de Paris, un blocus, pour être obligatoire,
doit être <i>déclaré</i> et <i>notifié</i>.
L'article 8 se borne à poser le principe qui
est appliqué par les articles suivants.</p>

<p>Il suffit, pour éviter toute équivoque,
d'indiquer nettement le sens des deux
expressions qui vont être fréquemment
employées. La <i>déclaration de blocus</i> est
l'acte de l'autorité compétente (Gouvernement
ou chef d'escadre), constatant
qu'un blocus est établi ou va
l'être dans des conditions qui doivent
être précisées (article 9). La <i>notification</i>
est le fait de porter à la connaissance
des Puissances neutres ou de
certaines autorités la déclaration de
blocus (article 11).</p>

<p>Le plus souvent, ces deux choses&mdash;la
déclaration et la notification&mdash;auront
lieu préalablement à l'application des
règles du blocus, c'est-à-dire, à l'interdiction
réelle du passage. Toutefois,
comme on le verra plus loin, il est parfois
possible que le passage soit interdit
à raison du fait même du blocus qui est
porté à la connaissance d'un navire approchant
d'un port bloqué, au moyen
d'une <i>notification</i> qui est <i>spéciale</i>, tandis
que la notification qui vient d'être définie,
et dont il est parlé à l'article 11,
a un caractère général.</p>

<p class="center">Article 9.</p>

<p><i>La déclaration de blocus est faite, soit
par la Puissance bloquante, soit par les
autorités navales agissant en son nom.</i></p>

<p><i>Elle précise:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>La date du commencement du
blocus;</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Les limites géographiques du
littoral bloqué;</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">3<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Le délai de sortie à accorder aux
navires neutres.</i></p>

<p>La déclaration de blocus émane le plus
souvent du Gouvernement belligérant
lui-même. Le Gouvernement peut
avoir laissé au commandant de ses
forces navales la faculté de déclarer lui-même
un blocus selon les circonstances.
Cette latitude aura peut-être lieu de
s'appliquer moins souvent qu'autrefois
à raison de la facilité et de la rapidité
des communications. Cela importe
peu: il y a là une question d'ordre
intérieur.</p>

<p>La déclaration de blocus doit préciser
certains points que les neutres ont intérêt
à connaître pour se rendre compte
de l'étendue de leurs obligations. Il
faut que l'on sache exactement quand
commence l'interdiction de communiquer
avec la localité bloquée. Il importe,
pour l'obligation du bloquant
comme pour l'obligation des neutres,
qu'il n'y ait pas d'incertitude sur les
points réellement bloqués. Enfin, depuis
longtemps, s'est établi l'usage de
laisser sortir les navires neutres qui
sont dans le port bloqué. On confirme
ici cet usage en ce sens que le bloquant
<i>doit accorder</i> un délai de sortie; on ne
fixe pas la durée de ce délai, parce que
cette durée est évidemment subordonnée
aux circonstances très variables.
Il a été seulement entendu qu'il y aurait
un délai <i>raisonnable</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Article 10.</p>

<p><i>Si la Puissance bloquante ou les autorités
navales agissant en son nom ne se
conforment pas aux mentions qu'en exécution
de l'article 9&mdash;1<span class="topnum">o</span> et 2<span class="topnum">o</span>, elles ont dû
inscrire dans la déclaration de blocus,
cette déclaration est nulle, et une nouvelle
déclaration est nécessaire pour que le
blocus produise ses effets.</i></p>

<p>Cet article a pour but d'assurer l'observation
de l'article 9. La déclaration
de blocus contient des mentions
qui ne correspondent pas à la réalité
des faits; elle indique que le blocus a
commencé ou commencera tel jour, et,
en fait, il n'a commencé que plusieurs
jours après. Les limites géographiques
sont exactement tracées; elles sont
plus étendues que celles dans lesquelles
opèrent les forces de blocus. Quelle
sera la sanction? La nullité de la déclaration
de blocus, ce qui fait que cette
déclaration ne produira aucun effet. Si,
donc, en pareil cas, un navire neutre est
saisi pour violation de blocus, il pourra
opposer la nullité de la saisie en se fondant
sur la nullité de la déclaration de
blocus; si son moyen est repoussé par
le tribunal national, il pourra se pourvoir
devant la Cour Internationale.</p>

<p>Il faut remarquer la portée de la
disposition pour qu'il n'y ait pas de
surprise. La déclaration porte que le
blocus commence le 1<span class="topnum">er</span> février; en fait,
il n'a commencé que le 8. Il va sans
dire que la déclaration n'a produit
aucun effet du 1<span class="topnum">er</span> au 8, puisqu'à ce
moment-là, il n'y avait pas de blocus
du tout; la déclaration constate un
fait, mais n'en tient pas lieu. La règle
va plus loin: la déclaration ne produira
pas même effet à partir du 8;
elle est nulle définitivement, et il faut
en faire une autre.</p>

<p>Il n'est pas parlé ici du cas où
l'article 9 aurait été méconnu, en ce
qu'aucun délai de sortie n'aurait été
accordé aux navires neutres se trouvant
dans le port bloqué. La sanction
ne saurait être la même. Il n'y a pas
de raison d'annuler la déclaration en ce
qui touche les bâtiments neutres voulant
pénétrer dans le porte bloqué. Il
faut une sanction spéciale, qui est indiquée
dans l'article 16, alinéa 2.</p>

<p class="center">Article 11.</p>

<p><i>La déclaration de blocus est notifiée</i>:</p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Aux Puissances neutres, par
la Puissance bloquante, au moyen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span>
d'une communication adressée aux Gouvernements
eux-mêmes ou à leurs représentants
accrédités auprès d'elle;</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Aux autorités locales, par le commandant
de la force bloquante. Ces
autorités, de leur côté, en informeront,
aussitôt que possible, les consuls
étrangers qui exercent leurs fonctions
dans le port ou sur le littoral bloqués.</i></p>

<p>La déclaration de blocus ne vaut que
si elle est notifiée. On ne peut exiger
l'observation d'une règle que de ceux
qui ont été en mesure de la connaître.</p>

<p>Il y a deux notifications à faire:</p>

<p class="blockquot">1. La première est adressée aux
Puissances neutres par la Puissance
belligérante, qui la communique aux
Gouvernements eux-mêmes ou à
leurs représentants accrédités auprès
d'elle. La communication aux Gouvernements
se fera le plus souvent au
moyen des agents diplomatiques: il
pourrait arriver qu'un belligérant ne
fût pas en rapports diplomatiques
avec un pays neutre; il s'adressera
directement au Gouvernement de ce
pays, ordinairement par la voie télégraphique.
C'est aux Gouvernements
neutres avisés de la déclaration
de blocus à prendre les mesures
nécessaires pour en faire parvenir la
nouvelle sur les divers points de leur
territoire, spécialement dans leurs
ports.</p>

<p class="blockquot">2. La seconde notification est faite
par le commandant de la force bloquante
aux autorités locales. Celles-ci
doivent informer, aussitôt que possible,
les consuls étrangers qui résident
dans la place ou sur le littoral
bloqués. Ces autorités engageraient
leur responsabilité en ne s'acquittant
pas de cette obligation. Les neutres
pourraient éprouver un préjudice du
fait de n'avoir pas été prévenus du
blocus en temps utile.</p>

<p class="center">Article 12.</p>

<p><i>Les règles relatives à la déclaration et
à la notification de blocus sont applicables
dans le cas où le blocus serait étendu ou
viendrait à être repris après avoir été levé.</i></p>

<p>Un blocus est étendu au-delà de ses
limites primitives; c'est, pour la partie
nouvelle, un blocus nouveau et, par
suite, les règles de la déclaration et de
la notification doivent s'y appliquer.
Il en est de même dans le cas où, après
avoir été levé, un blocus est repris; il
n'y a pas à tenir compte du fait qu'un
blocus a déjà existé pour la même
localité.</p>

<p class="center">Article 13.</p>

<p><i>La levée volontaire du blocus, ainsi que
toute restriction qui y serait apportée, doit
être notifiée dans la forme prescrite par
l'article 11.</i></p>

<p>S'il est indispensable de connaître
l'établissement d'un blocus, il serait
utile que le public fût renseigné sur la
levée du blocus, puisqu'elle fait cesser
l'entrave apportée aux relations des
neutres avec le port bloqué. Aussi
a-t-on jugé à propos de demander à la
Puissance qui lève un blocus de le faire
savoir dans la forme où elle a notifié
l'établissement du blocus (article 11).
Seulement, il y a lieu de remarquer que
la sanction ne saurait être la même dans
les deux cas. Pour la notification de
la déclaration de blocus, il y a une
sanction directe, adéquate: le blocus
non notifié n'est pas obligatoire. Pour
la levée, il ne saurait y avoir rien d'analogue.
Le public profitera, en fait, de
cette levée, quand même on ne la lui
aurait pas fait connaître officiellement.
La Puissance bloquante qui n'aurait
pas notifié la levée s'exposerait à des
réclamations diplomatiques motivées
par l'inaccomplissement d'un devoir
international. Cet inaccomplissement
aura des conséquences plus ou moins
graves suivant les circonstances. Parfois,
la levée du blocus aura été, en fait,
immédiatement connue, et la notification
officielle n'ajouterait rien à cette
publicité effective.</p>

<p>Il va sans dire qu'il ne s'agit que
de la levée <i>volontaire</i> du blocus; si le
bloquant a été chassé par l'arrivée de
forces ennemies, il ne peut être tenu de
faire connaître sa défaite, que son adversaire
se chargera d'annoncer sans
retard. Au lieu de lever un blocus, un
belligérant peut se contenter de le restreindre;
il ne bloque plus qu'un port
au lieu de deux. Pour le port qui cesse
d'être compris dans le blocus, c'est
comme s'il y avait levée volontaire; en
conséquence, la même règle s'applique.</p>

<p class="center">Article 14.</p>

<p><i>La saisissabilité d'un navire neutre
pour violation de blocus est subordonnée à
la connaissance réelle ou présumée du
blocus.</i></p>

<p>Pour qu'un navire soit saisissable
pour violation de blocus, la première
condition est qu'il ait eu connaissance
du blocus, parce qu'il n'est pas juste
de punir quelqu'un pour inobservation
d'une règle qu'il aurait ignorée. Toutefois,
il est des circonstances où, même
en l'absence d'une connaissance réelle
prouvée, on peut présumer cette connaissance,
sauf à réserver à l'intéressé
la faculté de démentir la présomption
(article 15).</p>

<p class="center">Article 15.</p>

<p><i>La connaissance du blocus est, sauf
preuve contraire, présumée, lorsque le
navire a quitté un port neutre postérieurement
à la notification, en temps utile, du
blocus à la Puissance dont relève ce port.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span></p>

<p>Un navire a quitté un port neutre
postérieurement à la notification du
blocus faite à la Puissance dont relève
le port. Cette notification avait-elle
été faite en temps utile, c'est-à-dire de
manière à parvenir dans le port même
où elle a dû être divulguée par les autorités
du port? C'est une question
de fait à examiner. Si elle est résolue
affirmativement, il est naturel de supposer
que le navire avait eu, lors de son
départ, connaissance du blocus. Cette
présomption n'est pourtant pas absolue
et la preuve contraire est réservée. Ce
sera au navire inculpé à la fournir, en
justifiant de l'existence de circonstances
qui expliquent son ignorance.</p>

<p class="center">Article 16.</p>

<p><i>Si le navire qui approche du port
bloqué n'a pas connu ou ne peut être présumé
avoir connu l'existence du blocus,
la notification doit être faite au navire
même par un officier de l'un des bâtiments
de la force bloquante. Cette notification
doit être portée sur le livre de bord
avec indication de la date et de l'heure,
ainsi que de la position géographique du
navire à ce moment.</i></p>

<p><i>Le navire neutre qui sort du port bloqué,
alors que, par la négligence du commandant
de la force bloquante, aucune déclaration
de blocus n'a été notifiée aux autorités
locales ou qu'un délai n'a pas été indiqué
dans la déclaration notifiée, doit être
laissé libre de passer.</i></p>

<p>On suppose un navire approchant du
port bloqué sans qu'on puisse dire qu'il
connaît ou qu'il est présumé connaître
l'existence du blocus; il n'a été touché
par aucune notification dans le sens de
l'article 11. Dans ce cas, une notification
spéciale est nécessaire pour faire
connaître régulièrement le fait du
blocus au navire. Cette notification
est faite au navire même par un officier
de l'un des bâtiments de la force bloquante
et portée sur le livre de bord;
elle peut être faite aux navires d'une
flotte convoyée par un vaisseau de
guerre neutre, grâce à l'intermédiaire
du commandant du convoi qui en donne
reçu et qui prend les mesures nécessaires
pour l'inscription de la notification
sur le livre de bord de chaque
navire. Elle mentionne les circonstances
de temps et de lieu dans lesquelles
elle est faite, ainsi que les lieux
bloqués. Le navire est empêché de
passer, ce qui fait que le blocus est
<i>obligatoire</i> pour lui, bien que n'ayant
pas été <i>préalablement</i> notifié; c'est
pour cela que cet adverbe a été omis
dans l'article 8. Il n'est pas admissible
qu'un navire de commerce ait la
prétention de ne pas tenir compte d'un
blocus réel et de forcer le blocus, par
cette seule raison qu'il n'en avait pas
personnellement connaissance. Seulement,
s'il peut être empêché de passer
il ne peut être saisi que lorsqu'il essaie
de forcer le blocus après avoir reçu la
notification. Comme on le voit, cette
notification spéciale joue un rôle très
restreint, et ne doit pas être confondue
avec la notification spéciale exigée
d'une manière absolue dans la pratique
de certaines marines.</p>

<p>Ce qui vient d'être dit se réfère au
navire venant du large. Il faut aussi
s'occuper du navire sortant du port
bloqué. Si une notification régulière
du blocus a été faite aux autorités
locales (article 11&mdash;2<span class="topnum">o</span>), la situation est
simple: le navire connaît, ou est présumé
connaître, le blocus, et s'expose
donc à la saisie dans le cas où il n'a pas
observé le délai donné par le bloquant.
Mais il peut arriver qu'aucune déclaration
de blocus n'ait été notifiée aux
autorités locales ou que cette déclaration
ait été muette au sujet du délai de
sortie, malgré la prescription de l'article
9&mdash;3<span class="topnum">o</span>. La sanction de la faute du bloquant
est que le navire doit être laissé
libre de passer. C'est une sanction
énergique qui correspond exactement à
la nature de la faute commise, et sera
le meilleur moyen d'empêcher de la
commettre.</p>

<p>Il va sans dire que cette disposition
ne concerne que les navires auxquels le
délai de sortie avait dû profiter&mdash;c'est-à-dire,
les navires neutres qui étaient
dans le port au moment de l'établissement
du blocus; elle est absolument
étrangère aux navires qui seraient
dans le port après avoir forcé le
blocus.</p>

<p>Le commandant de l'escadre de
blocus est toujours à même de réparer
son omission ou son erreur, de faire une
notification du blocus aux autorités
locales ou de compléter celle qu'il aurait
déjà faite.</p>

<p>Comme on le voit par ces explications,
on suppose le cas le plus ordinaire,
celui où l'absence de notification implique
une négligence du commandant
des forces de blocus. La situation se
trouve évidemment tout à fait changée,
si le commandant a fait tout ce qui dépendait
de lui pour faire la notification
et s'il en a été empêché par le mauvais
vouloir des autorités locales qui ont intercepté
toute communication avec le
dehors. Dans ce cas, il ne peut être
forcé de laisser passer les navires qui
veulent sortir et qui, en l'absence de la
notification exigée et de la connaissance
présumée du blocus, sont dans une situation
analogue à celle qui est prévue par
l'article 16, alinéa 1<span class="topnum">er</span>.</p>

<p class="center">Article 17.</p>

<p><i>La saisie des navires neutres pour violation
de blocus ne peut être effectuée que
dans le rayon d'action des bâtiments de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span>
guerre chargés d'assurer l'effectivité du
blocus.</i></p>

<p>L'autre condition de la saisissabilité
du navire est que celui-ci se trouve dans
le rayon d'action des bâtiments de
guerre chargés d'assurer l'effectivité du
blocus: il ne suffit pas qu'il soit en
route pour le port bloqué.</p>

<p>Quant à ce qui constitue le <i>rayon
d'action</i>, il a été fourni une explication
qui a été universellement acceptée, et qui
est reproduite ici comme le meilleur
commentaire de la règle de l'article 17:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Lorsqu'un Gouvernement décide
d'entreprendre une opération de
blocus contre une partie quelconque
de côte ennemie, il désigne un certain
nombre de navires de guerre qui devront
participer au blocus, et il en
confie le commandement à un officier
qui aura pour mission d'assurer par
leur moyen l'effectivité du blocus. Le
commandant de la force navale ainsi
constituée repartit les navires mis à
sa disposition suivant la configuration
de la côte et la situation géographique
des points bloqués, et
donne à chacun d'eux des instructions
sur le rôle qu'il aura à remplir,
et en particulier sur la zone confiée à
sa surveillance. C'est l'ensemble de
ces zones de surveillance, organisées
de telle manière que le blocus soit
effectif, qui forme le rayon d'action de
la force navale bloquante.</p>

<p>"Le rayon d'action ainsi compris
est étroitement lié à l'effectivité du
blocus et aussi au nombre des bâtiments
qui y sont affectés.</p>

<p>"Il peut se présenter des cas où
un seul navire suffira pour maintenir
un blocus effectif&mdash;par exemple, à
l'entrée d'un port ou à l'embouchure
d'un fleuve dont l'estuaire est peu
étendu&mdash;à la condition que les circonstances
permettent au bloqueur
de se tenir suffisamment rapproché
de l'entrée. Dans ce cas, le rayon
d'action est lui-même rapproché de
la côte. Mais, si les circonstances le
forcent, au contraire, à se tenir
éloigné, il pourra se faire que le navire
soit insuffisant pour assurer l'effectivité,
et il deviendra alors nécessaire
de lui adjoindre d'autres navires
pour la maintenir. De ce fait le
rayon d'action devient plus étendu
et plus éloigné de la côte. Il pourra
donc varier suivant les circonstances
et suivant le nombre des navires
bloqueurs, mais sera toujours limité
par la condition que l'effectivité soit
assurée.</p>

<p>"Il ne semble pas possible d'assigner
au rayon d'action des limites
en chiffres fixes et invariables, pas
plus qu'il n'est possible de fixer à
l'avance et invariablement le nombre
des bâtiments nécessaires pour assurer
l'effectivité de tout blocus.
Ces éléments doivent être déterminés,
suivant les circonstances, pour
chaque cas particulier de blocus;
peut-être pourrait-on le faire au
moment de la déclaration.</p>

<p>"Il est évident qu'un blocus ne
sera pas établi de la même façon pour
une côte sans défense et pour une
côte possédant tous les moyens modernes
de défense. Il ne saurait être
question dans ce dernier cas d'appliquer
une règle telle que celle qui
exigeait autrefois des vaisseaux arrêtés
et suffisamment proches des
points bloqués; la situation serait
trop dangereuse pour les navires de
la force bloquante qui, par ailleurs,
possèdent aujourd'hui des moyens
plus puissants leur permettant de surveiller
d'une façon effective une zone
beaucoup plus étendue que jadis.</p>

<p>"Le rayon d'action d'une force
navale bloquante pourra s'étendre
assez loin, mais, comme il dépend du
nombre des bâtiments concourant à
l'effectivité du blocus, et comme il
reste toujours limité par la condition
d'effectivité, il n'atteindra jamais des
mers éloignées sur lesquelles naviguent
des navires de commerce, peut-être
destinés aux ports bloqués, mais
dont la destination est subordonnée
aux modifications que les circonstances
sont susceptibles d'apporter
au blocus au cours du voyage. En
résumé, l'idée de rayon d'action liée
à celle d'effectivité telle que nous
avons essayé de la définir, c'est-à-dire,
comprenant la zone d'opérations
des forces bloquantes, permet
au belligérant d'exercer d'une manière
efficace le droit de blocus qui lui
est reconnu, et, d'un autre côté, elle
évite aux neutres d'être exposés à
grande distance aux inconvénients
du blocus, tout en leur laissant courir
les dangers auxquels ils s'exposent
sciemment en s'approchant des
points dont l'accès est interdit par le
belligérant."</p>

<p class="center">Article 18.</p>

<p><i>Les forces bloquantes ne doivent pas
barrer l'accès aux ports et aux côtes
neutres.</i></p>

<p>Cette règle a été jugée nécessaire
pour mieux sauvegarder les intérêts
commerciaux des pays neutres; elle
complète l'article 1<span class="topnum">er</span>, d'après lequel un
blocus doit être limité aux ports et
côtes de l'ennemi, ce qui implique que,
puisque c'est une opération de guerre,
il ne saurait être dirigé contre un port
neutre, malgré l'intérêt que pourrait y
avoir un belligérant à raison du rôle de
ce port neutre pour le ravitaillement de
son adversaire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">Article 19.</p>

<p><i>La violation du blocus est insuffisamment
caractérisée pour autoriser la saisie
du navire, lorsque celui-ci est actuellement
dirigé vers un port non bloqué, quelle
que soit la destination ultérieure du navire
ou de son chargement.</i></p>

<p>C'est la destination réelle du navire
qui doit être envisagée, quand il s'agit
de violation de blocus, et non la destination
ultérieure de la cargaison.
Cette destination prouvée ou présumée
ne peut donc suffire à autoriser la saisie,
pour violation de blocus, d'un navire
actuellement destiné à un port non
bloqué. Mais le croiseur pourrait toujours
établir que cette destination à
un port non bloqué est apparente et
qu'en réalité, la destination immédiate
du navire est bien le port bloqué.</p>

<p class="center">Article 20.</p>

<p><i>Le navire qui, en violation du blocus,
est sorti du port bloqué ou a tenté d'y
entrer, reste saisissable tant qu'il est
poursuivi par un bâtiment de la force
bloquante. Si la chasse en est abandonnée
ou si le blocus est levé, la saisie
n'en peut plus être pratiquée.</i></p>

<p>Un navire est sorti du port bloqué
ou a tenté d'y entrer. Sera-t-il indéfiniment
saisissable? L'affirmative
absolue serait excessive. Ce navire
doit rester saisissable tant qu'il est
poursuivi par un bâtiment de la force
bloquante; il ne suffirait pas qu'il fût
rencontré par un croiseur de l'ennemi
bloquant qui ne ferait pas partie de
l'escadre de blocus. La question de
savoir si la chasse est ou non abandonnée
est une question de fait; il ne
suffit pas que le navire se soit réfugié
dans un port neutre. Le navire qui
le poursuit peut attendre sa sortie, de
telle sorte que la chasse est forcément
suspendue, mais non abandonnée. La
saisie n'est plus possible quand le blocus
a été levé.</p>

<p class="center">Article 21.</p>

<p><i>Le navire reconnu coupable de violation
de blocus est confisqué. Le chargement
est également confisqué, à moins
qu'il soit prouvé qu'au moment où la
marchandise a été embarquée, le chargeur
n'a ni connu ni pu connaître l'intention
de violer le blocus.</i></p>

<p>Le navire est confisqué dans tous les
cas. Le chargement est aussi confisqué
en principe, mais on laisse à l'intéressé
la possibilité d'exciper de sa bonne foi,
c'est-à-dire, de prouver que, lors de
l'embarquement de la marchandise, le
chargeur ne connaissait pas et ne pouvait
connaître l'intention de violer le blocus.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre II.</span>&mdash;<i>De la contrebande
de guerre.</i></p>

<p>Ce chapitre est l'un des plus importants,
sinon le plus important, de la
Déclaration. Il traite d'une matière
qui a parfois provoqué de graves conflits
entre les belligérants et les neutres.
Aussi a-t-on souvent réclamé d'une
manière pressante un règlement qui
établirait d'une manière précise les
droits et devoirs de chacun. Le commerce
pacifique pourra être reconnaissant
de la précision qui, pour la première
fois, est apportée à ce sujet, qui
l'intéresse au plus haut point.</p>

<p>La notion de contrebande de guerre
comporte deux éléments: il s'agit
d'objets d'une certaine espèce et d'une
certaine destination. Des canons, par
exemple, sont transportés sur un navire
neutre. Sont-ils de la contrebande?
Cela dépend: non, s'ils sont destinés à
un Gouvernement neutre; oui, s'ils
sont destinés à un Gouvernement ennemi.
Le commerce de certains objets
n'est nullement interdit d'une manière
générale pendant la guerre; c'est le
commerce de ces objets avec l'ennemi
qui est illicite et contre lequel le belligérant,
au détriment duquel il se fait,
peut se protéger par les mesures qu'admet
le droit des gens.</p>

<p>Les articles 22 et 24 énumèrent les
objets et matériaux qui sont susceptibles
de constituer de la contrebande
de guerre et qui en constituent effectivement,
quand ils ont une certaine
destination, qui est déterminée par les
articles 30 et 33. La distinction traditionnelle
de la contrebande <i>absolue</i> et
de la contrebande <i>conditionnelle</i> est
maintenue: à la première se réfèrent
les articles 22 et 30, à la seconde les
articles 24 et 33.</p>

<p class="center">Article 22.</p>

<p><i>Sont de plein droit considérés comme
contrebande de guerre les objets et matériaux
suivants, compris sous le nom
de contrebande absolue, savoir:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Les armes de toute nature, y

<p>Cette liste est celle qui avait été arrêtée
à la Deuxième Conférence de la
Paix par le Comité chargé d'étudier
spécialement la question de la contrebande.
Elle était le résultat de concessions
mutuelles, et il n'a pas paru
sage de rouvrir les discussions à ce
sujet, soit pour retrancher, soit pour
ajouter des articles.</p>

<p>Les mots <i>sont de plein droit</i> veulent
dire que la disposition produit son effet,
par le fait même de la guerre, et qu'aucune
déclaration des belligérants n'est
nécessaire. Le commerce est averti
dès le temps de paix.</p>

<p class="center">Article 23.</p>

<p><i>Les objets et matériaux qui sont exclusivement

être ajoutés à la liste de contrebande absolue
au moyen d'une déclaration notifiée.</i></p>

<p><i>La notification est adressée aux Gouvernements
des autres Puissances ou à
leurs représentants accrédités auprès de
la Puissance qui fait la déclaration. La
notification faite après l'ouverture des
hostilités n'est adressée qu'aux Puissances
neutres.</i></p>

<p>Certaines découvertes ou inventions
pourraient rendre insuffisante la liste
de l'article 22. Une addition pourra y
être faite à condition qu'il s'agisse
d'objets et matériaux <i>qui sont exclusivement
employés à la guerre</i>. Cette addition
doit être notifiée aux autres
Puissances, qui prendront les mesures
nécessaires pour la faire connaître à
leurs nationaux. Théoriquement, la
notification peut se faire en temps de
paix ou en temps de guerre. Sans
doute, le premier cas se présentera rarement,
parce qu'un État faisant une
pareille notification pourrait être soupçonné
de songer à une guerre; cela aurait
néanmoins l'avantage de renseigner
le commerce à l'avance. Il n'y avait
pas de raison d'en exclure la possibilité.</p>

<p>On a trouvé excessive la faculté accordée
à une Puissance de faire une
addition à la liste en vertu de sa simple
déclaration. Il est à remarquer que
cette faculté ne présente pas les dangers
qu'on lui suppose. D'abord, bien entendu,
la déclaration ne produit d'effet
que pour celui qui la fait, en ce sens
que l'article ajouté ne sera de la contrebande
que pour lui, en tant que belligérant;
les autres États pourront
d'ailleurs faire une déclaration analogue.
L'addition ne peut concerner
que des objets <i>exclusivement employés à
la guerre</i>; actuellement il serait difficile
d'indiquer de tels objets ne rentrant
pas dans la liste. L'avenir est réservé.
Si une Puissance avait la prétention
d'ajouter à la liste de contrebande absolue
des articles non exclusivement
employés à la guerre, elle pourrait
s'attirer des réclamations diplomatiques,
puisqu'elle méconnaîtrait une
règle acceptée. De plus, il y aurait un
recours éventuel devant la Cour Internationale
des Prises. On peut supposer
que la Cour estime que l'objet
mentionné dans la déclaration de contrebande
absolue y figure à tort, parce
qu'il n'est pas exclusivement employé
à la guerre, mais qu'il aurait pu rentrer
dans une déclaration de contrebande
conditionnelle. La confiscation pourra
se justifier si la saisie a été faite dans les
conditions prévues pour cette espèce de
contrebande (articles 33 à 35), qui
diffèrent de celles qu'on applique à la
contrebande absolue (article 30).</p>

<p>Il avait été suggéré que, dans l'intérêt
du commerce neutre, un délai devrait
s'écouler entre la notification et son application.
Mais cela aurait été très
préjudiciable au belligérant qui veut
précisément se protéger, puisque, pendant
le délai, le commerce des articles
jugés par lui dangereux aurait été libre,
et que l'effet de sa mesure aurait été
manqué. Il a été tenu compte, sous une
autre forme, des considérations d'équité
qui avaient été invoquées (voir article
43).</p>

le commerce de tel article rentrant

Il est à désirer qu'il fasse connaître
son intention à ce sujet, et il est
probable qu'il le fera pour avoir le
mérite de la mesure. S'il ne le fait pas,
et s'il se contente de donner des instructions
à ses croiseurs, les navires visités
seront agréablement surpris si le visiteur
ne leur reproche pas de transporter

<p><i>Les objets et matériaux qui ne sont pas

<p>L'existence d'une liste dite <i>libre</i>

que les objets qui ne sont pas susceptibles

<p>C'est pour diminuer les inconvénients
de la guerre pour le commerce qu'il a
été jugé utile de dresser cette <i>liste</i> dite
<i>libre</i>, ce qui ne veut pas dire, comme il
a été expliqué plus haut, que tous les
objets restés en dehors pourraient être
déclarés contrebande de guerre.</p>

<p>Les <i>minerais</i> sont les produits des
mines servant à obtenir des métaux
(<i>metallic ores</i>).</p>

<p>On avait demandé de faire rentrer
dans le 10<span class="topnum">o</span> les <i>produits tinctoriaux</i>;
cela a paru trop général; il y a des matières
d'où on tire des couleurs, comme
le charbon, mais qui servent aussi à
d'autres usages. Les produits qui ne
sont utilisés que pour obtenir des couleurs
bénéficient de l'exemption.</p>

<p>Les "articles de Paris" dont tout le
monde comprend la signification rentrent
dans le 15<span class="topnum">o</span>.</p>

<p>Dans le 16<span class="topnum">o</span>, il s'agit des soies de certains
animaux comme les porcs et les
sangliers.</p>

<p>Les tapis et les nattes rentrent dans
les objets d'ameublement et d'ornement
(17<span class="topnum">o</span>).</p>

<p class="center">Article 29.</p>

<p><i>Ne peuvent non plus être considérés
comme contrebande de guerre:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Les objets et matériaux servant
exclusivement à soigner les malades et
les blessés. Toutefois, ils peuvent, en
cas de nécessité militaire importante,
être réquisitionnés, moyennant une indemnité,
lorsqu'ils ont la destination
prévue à l'article 30.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Les objets et matériaux destinés
à l'usage du navire où ils sont trouvés,
ainsi qu'à l'usage de l'équipage et des
passagers de ce navire pendant la
traversée.</i></p>

<p>Si les objets énumérés dans l'article
29 ne sont pas non plus considérés
comme contrebande de guerre, c'est
pour des motifs autres que ceux qui
ont fait admettre la liste de l'article 28.</p>

<p>Des raisons d'humanité ont fait
écarter les objets et matériaux servant
exclusivement à soigner les malades et
les blessés, ce qui comprend naturellement
les drogues et les divers médicaments.
Il ne s'agit pas des bateaux
hospitaliers, pour lesquels une immunité
spéciale est assurée par la Convention
de La Haye du 18 octobre 1907,
mais de navires de commerce ordinaires
dont le chargement comprendrait des
objets de la nature indiquée. Le croiseur
a toutefois le droit, en cas de
nécessité importante, de réquisitionner
ces objets pour les besoins de son équipage
ou de sa flotte; cette réquisition
ne peut être faite que moyennant indemnité.
Mais il faut remarquer que
ce droit de réquisition ne peut s'exercer
dans tous les cas. Les objets dont il
s'agit doivent avoir la destination
prévue à l'article 30, c'est-à-dire, la
destination ennemie. Autrement le
droit commun reprend son empire:
un belligérant ne saurait avoir le droit
de réquisition à l'égard des navires
neutres en pleine mer.</p>

<p>On ne peut non plus considérer
comme contrebande les objets et matériaux
destinés à l'usage du navire et
qui pourraient, en eux-mêmes et par
leur nature, constituer de la contrebande
de guerre, par exemple les armes
destinées à défendre le navire contre
les pirates ou à faire des signaux. Il
en est de même de ce qui est destiné à
l'usage de l'équipage et des passagers
pendant la traversée; l'équipage comprend
ici tout le personnel du navire en
général.</p>

<p><i>De la destination de la contrebande.</i>&mdash;Comme
il a été dit, le deuxième élément
de la notion de contrebande est <i>la destination</i>.
De grandes difficultés se sont
produites à ce sujet et se symbolisent
dans la <i>théorie du voyage continu</i>, souvent
combattue ou invoquée sans que
l'on se rende bien compte de son exacte
signification. Il faut envisager simplement
les situations en elles-mêmes et
voir comment elles doivent être réglées
de manière à ne pas tracasser inutilement
les neutres et à ne pas sacrifier
les droits légitimes des belligérants.</p>

<p>Pour amener un rapprochement entre
des théories et des pratiques contraires,
on a séparé, à ce point de vue, la contrebande
absolue de la contrebande conditionnelle.</p>

<p>A la contrebande absolue se rapportent
les articles 30 à 32, à la contrebande
conditionnelle les articles 33 à 36.</p>

<p class="center">Article 30.</p>

<p><i>Les articles de contrebande absolue sont
saisissables, s'il est établi qu'ils sont destinés
au territoire de l'ennemi ou à un
territoire occupé par lui ou à ses forces
armées. Peu importe que le transport de
ces objets se fasse directement ou exige,
soit un transbordement, soit un trajet par
terre.</i></p>

<p>Les objets compris dans la liste de
l'article 22 constituent de la contrebande
absolue, quand ils sont destinés
à un territoire de l'ennemi ou à un
territoire occupé par lui ou à ses forces
armées de terre ou de mer. Ces objets
sont saisissables, du moment qu'une<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
pareille destination finale peut être
établie par le capteur. Ce n'est donc
pas la destination du navire qui est
décisive, c'est la destination de la marchandise.
Celle-ci a beau être à bord
d'un navire qui doit la débarquer dans
un port neutre; du moment que le
capteur est à même d'établir que cette
marchandise doit, de là, être transportée
en pays ennemi par voie maritime
ou terrestre, cela suffit pour justifier
la saisie et ensuite la confiscation de
la cargaison. C'est le principe même
du voyage continu qui est ainsi consacré,
pour la contrebande absolue, par
l'article 30. On regarde comme ne
faisant qu'un tout le trajet suivi par
la marchandise.</p>

<p class="center">Article 31.</p>

<p><i>La destination prévue à l'article 30
est définitivement prouvée dans les cas
suivants:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Lorsque la marchandise est
documentée pour être débarquée dans
un port de l'ennemi ou pour être livrée
à ses forces armées.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Lorsque le navire ne doit aborder
qu'à des ports ennemis, ou lorsqu'il
doit toucher à un port de l'ennemi ou
rejoindre ses forces armées, avant
d'arriver au port neutre pour lequel la
marchandise est documentée.</i></p>

<p>Comme il a été dit, c'est au capteur
qu'incombe l'obligation de prouver que
la marchandise de contrebande a bien
la destination prévue par l'article 30.
Dans certains cas prévus par l'article
31, cette destination est <i>définitivement</i>
prouvée, c'est-à-dire que la preuve
contraire n'est pas admise.</p>

<p><i>Premier Cas.</i>&mdash;La marchandise est
<i>documentée</i> pour être débarquée dans
un port ennemi, c'est-à-dire que,
d'après les papiers de bord qui se réfèrent
à cette marchandise, elle doit bien
y être débarquée. Il y a alors un véritable
aveu, de la part des intéressés eux-mêmes,
de la destination ennemie.</p>

<p><i>Deuxième Cas.</i>&mdash;Le navire ne doit
aborder qu'à des ports ennemis ou bien
il doit toucher à un port ennemi avant
d'arriver au port neutre pour lequel la
marchandise est documentée. Ainsi
cette marchandise doit bien, d'après
les papiers qui la concernent, être débarquée
dans un port neutre, mais le
navire qui la porte doit, avant d'arriver
à ce port, toucher à un port
ennemi. Elle sera saisissable et on
ne réserve pas la possibilité de prouver
que la destination neutre est réelle
et conforme aux intentions des intéressés.
La circonstance que, avant
de parvenir à cette destination, le navire
touchera à un port ennemi, ferait
naître un trop grand risque pour le belligérant
dont le croiseur visite le navire.
Sans supposer même une fraude préméditée,
il pourrait y avoir, pour le
capitaine du navire de commerce, une
forte tentation de débarquer la contrebande
dont il trouverait un prix avantageux,
et, pour l'autorité locale, la
tentation de réquisitionner cette marchandise.</p>

<p>Le cas où le navire, avant d'arriver
au port neutre, doit rejoindre les forces
armées de l'ennemi, est identique.</p>

<p>Pour simplifier, la disposition ne parle
que d'un <i>port ennemi</i>; il va de soi qu'il
faut lui assimiler le <i>port occupé par
l'ennemi</i>, comme cela résulte de la
règle générale de l'article 30.</p>

<p class="center">Article 32.</p>

<p><i>Les papiers de bord font preuve complète
de l'itinéraire du navire transportant
de la contrebande absolue, à moins que
le navire soit rencontré ayant manifestement
dévié de la route qu'il devrait suivre
d'après ses papiers de bord et sans pouvoir
justifier d'une cause suffisante de
cette déviation.</i></p>

<p>Les papiers de bord font donc preuve
complète de l'itinéraire du navire, à
moins que ce navire soit rencontré dans
des circonstances qui montrent que l'on
ne peut se fier à leurs allégations. Voir,
d'ailleurs, les explications données à
propos de l'article 35.</p>

<p class="center">Article 33.</p>

<p><i>Les articles de contrebande conditionnelle
sont saisissables, s'il est établi qu'ils
sont destinés à l'usage des forces armées
ou des administrations de l'État ennemi,
à moins, dans ce dernier cas, que les circonstances
établissent qu'en fait ces
articles ne peuvent être utilisés pour la
guerre en cours; cette dernière réserve
ne s'applique pas aux envois visés par
l'article 24&mdash;4<span class="topnum">o</span>.</i></p>

<p>Les règles qui concernent la contrebande
conditionnelle diffèrent de celles
qui ont été posées pour la contrebande
absolue, à un double point de vue: 1<span class="topnum">o</span>
il ne s'agit pas d'une destination à
l'ennemi en général, mais d'une destination
à l'usage de ses forces armées
ou de ses administrations; 2<span class="topnum">o</span> la doctrine
du voyage continu est écartée.
A la première idée correspondent les
articles 33 et 34; à la seconde correspond
l'article 35.</p>

<p>Les objets compris dans la liste de la
contrebande conditionnelle peuvent
servir à des usages pacifiques comme à
des emplois hostiles. Si, d'après les
circonstances, l'emploi pacifique est
certain, la saisie ne se justifie pas; il
en est autrement si l'emploi hostile doit
se supposer, ce qui arrive, par exemple,
s'il s'agit de vivres destinés à une armée
ou à une flotte de l'ennemi, de charbon
destiné à une flotte ennemie. En cas
pareil, il n'y a évidemment pas de
doute. Mais que faut-il décider quand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span>
c'est à l'usage des administrations
civiles d'État ennemi que les objets
sont destinés? C'est de l'argent qui
est envoyé à une administration civile
et qui doit être employé au paiement
du salaire de ses agents, des rails de
chemin de fer qui sont expédiés à une
administration des travaux publics. Il
y aura, dans ces cas, <i>destination ennemie</i>
rendant la marchandise saisissable
d'abord et confiscable ensuite. Cela
s'explique pour des raisons à la fois
juridiques et pratiques. L'État est un,
quoique les fonctions nécessaires à son
action soient confiées à diverses administrations.
Si une administration
civile peut recevoir librement des vivres
ou de l'argent, cela ne profite pas à elle
seule, mais à l'État tout entier, y compris
l'administration militaire, puisque
les ressources générales de l'État augmentent
ainsi. Il y a plus: ce que
reçoit une administration civile peut
être jugé plus nécessaire à l'administration
militaire et attribué directement
à celle-ci. L'argent ou les vivres
réellement destinés à une administration
civile peuvent se trouver ainsi
directement employés aux besoins de
l'armée. Cette possibilité, qui existe
toujours, explique pourquoi la destination
aux administrations de l'État
ennemi est assimilée à la destination
aux forces armées.</p>

<p>Il s'agit des <i>administrations de l'État</i>,
qui sont des dépendances du pouvoir
central, et non de toutes les administrations
qui peuvent exister dans l'État
ennemi; les administrations locales,
municipales, par exemple, n'y rentrent
pas, et ce qui serait destiné à leur usage
ne constituerait pas de la contrebande.</p>

<p>La guerre peut se poursuivre dans des
circonstances telles que la destination
à l'usage d'une administration civile ne
puisse être suspectée et ne puisse, par
conséquent, donner à la marchandise
le caractère de contrebande. Par exemple,
une guerre existe en Europe et
les colonies des pays belligérants ne
sont pas, en fait, atteintes par la guerre.
Les vivres ou autres objets de la liste de
contrebande conditionnelle qui seraient
destinés à l'usage d'une administration
civile coloniale ne seraient pas réputés
contrebande de guerre, parce que les
considérations invoquées plus haut ne
s'appliquent pas dans l'espèce; il ne
peut y avoir emprunt pour les besoins
de la guerre des ressources de l'administration
civile. Exception est faite
pour l'or et l'argent ou les papiers
représentatifs de la monnaie, parce
qu'une somme d'argent peut facilement
se transmettre d'un bout du monde à
l'autre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 34.</p>

<p><i>Il y a présomption de la destination
prévue à l'article 33, si l'envoi est adressé
aux autorités ennemies, ou à un commerçant
établi en pays ennemi et lorsqu'il est
notoire que ce commerçant fournit à l'ennemi
des objets et matériaux de cette
nature. Il en est de même si l'envoi est
à destination d'une place fortifiée ennemie,
ou d'une autre place servant de
base aux forces armées ennemies; toutefois,
cette présomption ne s'applique point
au navire de commerce lui-même faisant
route vers une de ces places et dont on
entend établir le caractère de contrebande.</i></p>

<p><i>A défaut des présomptions ci-dessus,
la destination est présumée innocente.</i></p>

<p><i>Les présomptions établies dans le présent
article admettent la preuve contraire.</i></p>

<p>Ordinairement les articles de contrebande
ne seront pas expressément adressés
aux autorités militaires ou aux
administrations de l'État ennemi. On
dissimulera plus ou moins la destination
véritable; c'est au capteur à
l'établir pour justifier la saisie. Mais
on a cru raisonnable d'établir des présomptions,
soit à raison de la qualité
du destinataire, soit à raison du caractère
de la place à laquelle sont destinés
les objets. C'est une autorité ennemie
ou un commerçant établi en pays ennemi,
qui est le fournisseur notoire du
Gouvernement ennemi pour les articles
dont il s'agit. C'est une place fortifiée
ennemie ou une place servant de base
aux forces armées ennemies, que ce
soit une base d'opérations ou une base
de ravitaillement.</p>

<p>Cette présomption générale ne saurait
s'appliquer au navire de commerce lui-même
qui se dirigerait vers une place
fortifiée et qui peut bien, par lui-même,
constituer de la contrebande relative,
mais à la condition que sa destination
à l'usage des forces armées ou des administrations
de l'État ennemi soit
directement prouvée.</p>

<p>A défaut des présomptions précédentes,
la destination est présumée
innocente. C'est le droit commun,
d'après lequel le capteur doit prouver
le caractère illicite de la marchandise
qu'il prétend saisir.</p>

<p>Enfin, toutes les présomptions ainsi
établies dans l'intérêt du capteur ou
contre lui admettent la preuve contraire.
Les tribunaux nationaux d'abord,
la Cour Internationale ensuite, apprécieront.</p>

<p class="center">Article 35.</p>

<p><i>Les articles de contrebande conditionnelle
ne sont saisissables que sur le navire
qui fait route vers le territoire de l'ennemi
ou vers un territoire occupé par lui ou vers
ses forces armées et que ne doit pas les décharger
dans un port intermédiaire neutre.</i></p>

<p><i>Les papiers de bord font preuve complète
de l'itinéraire du navire ainsi que
du lieu de déchargement des marchandises,
à moins que ce navire soit rencontré
ayant manifestement dévié de la route<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>
qu'il devrait suivre d'après ses papiers
de bord et sans pouvoir justifier d'une
cause suffisante de cette déviation.</i></p>

<p>Comme il a été dit plus haut, la doctrine
du voyage continu a été écartée
pour la contrebande conditionnelle.
Celle-ci n'est donc saisissable que si
elle doit être débarquée dans un port
ennemi. Du moment que la marchandise
est documentée pour être débarquée
dans un port neutre, elle ne
peut constituer de la contrebande, et il
n'y a pas à rechercher si, de ce port
neutre, elle doit être expédiée à l'ennemi
par mer ou par terre. C'est la
différence essentielle avec la contrebande
absolue.</p>

<p>Les papiers de bord font preuve
complète de l'itinéraire du navire et du
lieu de déchargement de la cargaison;
il en serait autrement si le navire était
rencontré ayant manifestement dévié
de la route qu'il devrait suivre d'après
ses papiers et sans pouvoir justifier
d'une cause suffisante de cette déviation.</p>

<p>Cette règle sur la preuve fournie par
les papiers de bord a pour but d'écarter
des prétentions élevées à la légère par un
croiseur et amenant des saisies injustifiées.
Elle ne doit pas être entendue
d'une manière trop absolue qui faciliterait
toutes les fraudes. Ainsi elle
n'est pas maintenue quand le navire
est rencontré en mer ayant manifestement
dévié de la route qu'il aurait dû
suivre et sans pouvoir justifier de cette
déviation. Les papiers de bord sont
alors contredits par la réalité des faits
et perdent toute force probante; le
croiseur se décidera librement suivant
les cas. De même, la visite du navire
peut permettre de constater des faits
qui prouvent d'une manière irréfutable
que la destination du navire ou le lieu
de déchargement de la marchandise
sont faussement indiqués dans les
papiers de bord. Le croiseur apprécie
alors librement les circonstances et
saisit ou non le navire suivant cette
appréciation. En résumé, les papiers
de bord font preuve, à moins que la
fausseté de leurs indications ne soit
démontrée par les faits. Cette restriction
de la force probante des papiers de
bord a paru aller de soi et ne pas avoir
besoin d'être expressément mentionnée.
On n'a pas voulu avoir l'air de diminuer
la force de la règle générale, qui est une
garantie pour le commerce neutre.</p>

<p>De ce qu'une indication est reconnue
fausse, il ne résulte pas que la force probante
des papiers de bord soit infirmée
dans son ensemble. Les indications pour
lesquelles aucune allégation de fausseté
ne peut être vérifiée conservent leur
valeur.</p>

<p class="center">Article 36.</p>

<p><i>Par dérogation à l'article 35, si le
territoire de l'ennemi n'a pas de frontière
maritime, les articles de contrebande conditionnelle
sont saisissables, lorsqu'il est
établi qu'ils ont la destination prévue à
l'article 33.</i></p>

<p>Le cas prévu est assurément rare,
mais cependant il s'est présenté dans
des guerres récentes. Pour la contrebande
absolue, il n'y a pas de difficulté,
puisque la destination à l'ennemi peut
toujours être prouvée, quel que soit
l'itinéraire à suivre par la marchandise
(article 30). Il en est autrement pour
la contrebande conditionnelle, et une
dérogation doit être apportée à la règle
générale de l'article 35, alinéa 1<span class="topnum">er</span>, de
manière à permettre au capteur
d'établir que la marchandise suspecte
a bien la destination spéciale prévue à
l'article 33, sans qu'on puisse objecter
le fait du déchargement dans un port
neutre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 37.</p>

<p><i>Le navire transportant des articles, qui
sont saisissables comme contrebande absolue
ou conditionnelle, peut être saisi,
en haute mer ou dans les eaux des belligérants,
pendant tout le cours de son voyage,
même s'il a l'intention de toucher à un
port d'escale avant d'atteindre la destination
ennemie.</i></p>

<p>Le navire peut être saisi pour cause
de contrebande pendant tout le cours
de son voyage, pourvu qu'il soit dans
des eaux où un acte de guerre est licite.
Le fait qu'il aurait l'intention de
toucher à un port d'escale avant d'atteindre
la destination ennemie n'empêche
pas la saisie, du moment que,
dans l'espèce, la destination ennemie
est établie conformément aux règles
établies par les articles 30 à 32 pour la
contrebande absolue, par les articles
33 à 35 pour la contrebande conditionnelle,
et sous la réserve de l'exception
de l'article 36.</p>

<p class="center">Article 38.</p>

<p><i>Une saisie ne peut être pratiquée en
raison d'un transport de contrebande
antérieurement effectué et actuellement
achevé.</i></p>

<p>Un navire est saisissable quand il
transporte de la contrebande, mais non
pour en avoir transporté.</p>

<p class="center">Article 39.</p>

<p><i>Les articles de contrebande sont sujets
à confiscation.</i></p>

<p>Cela ne présente aucune difficulté.</p>

<p class="center">Article 40.</p>

<p><i>La confiscation du navire transportant
de la contrebande est permise, si cette contrebande
forme, soit par sa valeur, soit
par son poids, soit par son volume, soit
par son fret, plus de la moitié de la cargaison.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span></p>

<p>Tout le monde admettait bien que,
dans certains cas, la confiscation de la
contrebande ne suffit pas et que la confiscation
doit atteindre le navire lui-même,
mais les opinions différaient sur
la détermination de ces cas. On s'est
arrêté à une certaine proportion à
établir entre la contrebande et l'ensemble
de la cargaison. Mais la question
se subdivise: 1<span class="topnum">o</span> Quelle sera cette
proportion? La solution adoptée tient
le milieu entre les solutions proposées,
qui allaient du quart aux trois quarts.
2<span class="topnum">o</span> Comment sera calculée cette proportion?
La contrebande devra-t-elle
former plus de la moitié de la cargaison
en volume, en poids, en valeur, en fret?
L'adoption d'un critérium déterminé
prête à des objections théoriques et facilite
aussi des pratiques destinées à éviter
la confiscation du navire malgré l'importance
de la cargaison. Si on prend
le volume ou le poids, le capitaine prendra
des marchandises licites assez volumineuses
ou pesantes pour que le
volume ou le poids de la contrebande
soit inférieur. Une observation analogue
peut être faite en ce qui concerne
la valeur ou le fret. La conséquence
est qu'il suffit, pour justifier la confiscation,
que la contrebande forme plus
de la moitié de la cargaison à l'un quelconque
des points de vue indiqués.
Cela peut paraître sévère; mais, d'une
part, en procédant autrement, on faciliterait
des calculs frauduleux, et
d'autre part, il est permis de dire que
la confiscation du navire est justifiée,
lorsque le transport de la contrebande
était une partie notable de son trafic,
ce qui est vrai pour chacun des cas
prévus.</p>

<p class="center">Article 41.</p>

<p><i>Si le navire transportant de la contrebande
est relâché, les frais occasionnés au
capteur par la procédure devant la juridiction
nationale des prises ainsi que par
la conservation du navire et de sa cargaison
pendant l'instruction sont à la
charge du navire.</i></p>

<p>Il n'est pas juste que, d'une part, le
transport de contrebande au-delà d'une
certaine proportion entraîne la confiscation
du navire, tandis qu'au-dessous
de cette proportion, il n'y a que la
confiscation de la contrebande, ce qui
souvent n'est pas une perte pour le
capitaine, le fret de cette contrebande
ayant été payé à l'avance. N'y a-t-il
pas là un encouragement à la contrebande,
et ne conviendrait-il pas de faire
subir une certaine peine pour le transport
inférieur à la proportion requise
pour la confiscation? On avait proposé
une espèce d'amende qui aurait
pu être en rapport avec la valeur des
articles de contrebande. Des objections
d'ordre divers ont été formulées
contre cette proposition, bien que le
principe d'une perte pécuniaire infligée
à raison du transport de la contrebande
eût paru justifié. On est arrivé au
même but d'une autre façon en disposant
que les frais occasionnés au capteur
par la procédure devant la juridiction
nationale des prises, comme par la conservation
du navire et de sa cargaison
pendant l'instruction, sont à la charge
du navire; les frais de conservation du
navire comprennent, le cas échéant, les
frais d'entretien du personnel du navire
capturé. Il convient d'ajouter que le
dommage causé au navire par sa conduite
et son séjour dans un port de
prise est de nature à produire l'effet
préventif le plus sérieux en ce qui concerne
le transport de la contrebande.</p>

<p class="center">Article 42.</p>

<p><i>Les marchandises qui appartiennent
au propriétaire de la contrebande et qui
se trouvent à bord du même navire sont
sujettes à confiscation.</i></p>

<p>Le propriétaire de la contrebande est
puni d'abord par la confiscation de sa
propriété illicite; il l'est ensuite par la
confiscation des marchandises, même
licites, qu'il peut avoir sur le même
navire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 43.</p>

<p><i>Si un navire est rencontré en mer naviguant
dans l'ignorance des hostilités ou de
la déclaration de contrebande applicable
à son chargement, les articles de contrebande
ne peuvent être confisqués que
moyennant indemnité; le navire et le
surplus de la cargaison sont exempts de
la confiscation et des frais prévus par
l'article 41. Il en est de même si le
capitaine, après avoir eu connaissance de
l'ouverture des hostilités ou de la déclaration
de contrebande, n'a pu encore décharger
les articles de contrebande.</i></p>

<p><i>Le navire est réputé connaître l'état de
guerre ou la déclaration de contrebande,
lorsqu'il a quitté un port neutre, après
que la notification de l'ouverture des hostilités
ou de la déclaration de contrebande
a été faite, en temps utile, à la Puissance
dont relève ce port. L'état de guerre est,
en outre, réputé connu par le navire
lorsqu'il a quitté un port ennemi après
l'ouverture des hostilités.</i></p>

<p>La disposition a pour but de ménager
les neutres qui, en fait, transporteraient
de la contrebande, mais auxquels on ne
pourrait rien reprocher, ce qui peut se
présenter dans deux cas. Le premier
est celui où ils ne connaissent pas l'ouverture
des hostilités; le second est
celui où, tout en connaissant cette
ouverture, ils ignorent la déclaration
de contrebande qu'a faite un belligérant
conformément aux articles 23 et
25, et qui est précisément applicable à
tout ou partie du chargement. Il
serait injuste de saisir le navire et de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
confisquer la contrebande; d'autre
part, le croiseur ne peut être obligé de
laisser aller à l'ennemi des produits
propres à la guerre et dont celui-ci peut
avoir grand besoin. Les intérêts en
présence sont conciliés en ce sens
qu'alors la confiscation ne peut avoir
lieu que moyennant indemnité (voir,
dans un ordre d'idées analogue, la
Convention du 18 octobre 1907, sur le
régime des navires de commerce ennemis
au début des hostilités).</p>

<p class="center">Article 44.</p>

<p><i>Le navire arrêté pour cause de contrebande
et non susceptible de confiscation à
raison de la proportion de la contrebande
peut être autorisé, suivant les circonstances,
à continuer sa route, si le capitaine
est prêt à livrer la contrebande au
bâtiment belligérant.</i></p>

<p><i>La remise de la contrebande est mentionnée
par le capteur sur le livre de bord
du navire arrêté, et le capitaine de ce
navire doit remettre au capteur copie
certifiée conforme de tous papiers utiles.</i></p>

<p><i>Le capteur a la faculté de détruire la
contrebande qui lui est ainsi livrée.</i></p>

<p>Un navire neutre est arrêté pour
cause de contrebande. Il n'est pas
susceptible de confiscation, parce que
la contrebande n'atteint pas la proportion
prévue par l'article 40. Il peut
néanmoins être conduit dans un port
de prise pour qu'il y ait un jugement
relatif à la contrebande. Ce droit du
capteur paraît excessif dans certains
cas, si on compare le peu d'importance
que peut avoir la contrebande (une
caisse de fusils ou de revolvers, par
exemple) et le grave préjudice qu'entraînent
pour le navire ce détournement
de sa route et sa retenue pendant
le temps de l'instruction. Aussi s'est-on
demandé s'il n'était pas possible de
reconnaître au navire neutre le droit de
continuer sa route moyennant la remise
des objets de contrebande au
capteur qui, de son côté, n'aurait pu
les refuser que pour des motifs suffisants,
par exemple, le mauvais état de
la mer, qui rend le transbordement impossible
ou difficile, des soupçons fondés
au sujet de la quantité véritable de contrebande
que porte le navire de commerce,
la difficulté de loger les objets à
bord du navire de guerre, etc. Cette
proposition n'a pas réuni les suffrages
suffisants. On a prétendu qu'il était
impossible d'imposer une pareille obligation
au croiseur pour lequel cette remise
présenterait presque toujours des
inconvénients. Si, par hasard, il n'y
en a pas, le croiseur ne la refusera pas,
parce qu'il aura lui-même avantage à
ne pas être détourné de sa route par la
nécessité de conduire le navire dans un
port. Le système de l'obligation étant
ainsi écarté, on a décidé de réglementer
la remise facultative qui, espère-t-on,
sera pratiquée toutes les fois que ce sera
possible, au grand avantage des deux
parties. Les formalités prévues sont
très simples et n'exigent pas d'explication.</p>

<p>Un jugement du tribunal des prises
devra intervenir au sujet de la marchandise
ainsi remise. C'est pour cela
que le capteur doit se munir des papiers
nécessaires. On pourrait concevoir
qu'il y eût doute sur le caractère de
certains objets que le croiseur prétend
être de contrebande; le capitaine du
navire de commerce conteste, mais il
préfère les livrer pour avoir la faculté
de continuer sa route. Il n'y a là
qu'une saisie devant être confirmée par
la juridiction des prises.</p>

<p>La contrebande livrée par le navire
de commerce peut embarrasser le croiseur
qui doit être laissé libre de la détruire
au moment même de la remise
ou postérieurement.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre III.</span>&mdash;<i>De l'assistance hostile.</i></p>

<p>D'une manière générale, on peut dire
que le navire de commerce qui manque
à la neutralité, soit en transportant de
la contrebande de guerre, soit en violant
un blocus, fournit une assistance à
l'ennemi, et c'est à ce titre que le belligérant
au préjudice duquel il agit peut
lui faire subir certaines pertes. Mais
il y a des cas où cette assistance hostile
est particulièrement caractérisée et
qu'on a jugé nécessaire de prévoir
spécialement. On en a fait deux catégories
d'après la gravité du fait reproché
au navire neutre.</p>

<p>Dans les cas qui rentrent dans la
première catégorie (article 45), le navire
est confisqué, et on lui applique le
traitement du navire sujet à confiscation
pour transport de contrebande.
Cela signifie que le navire ne perd pas
sa qualité de neutre et a droit aux
garanties admises pour les navires
neutres; par exemple, il ne pourrait
être détruit par le capteur que dans les
conditions établies pour les navires
neutres (articles 48 et suivants); la
règle <i>le pavillon couvre la marchandise</i>
s'applique en ce qui concerne la marchandise
qui se trouve à bord.</p>

<p>Dans les cas plus graves qui appartiennent
à la seconde catégorie (article
46), le navire est encore confisqué; de
plus, il n'est pas traité seulement
comme un navire confiscable comme
porteur de contrebande, mais comme
un navire de commerce ennemi, ce qui
entraîne certaines conséquences. Le
règlement sur la destruction des prises
neutres ne s'applique pas au navire, et,
celui-ci devenant navire ennemi, ce
n'est plus la seconde, mais c'est la
troisième règle de la Déclaration de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>
Paris qui est applicable. La marchandise
qui sera à bord sera présumée
ennemie; les neutres auront le droit de
réclamer leur propriété en justifiant de
leur neutralité (article 59). Il ne faut
cependant pas exagérer jusqu'à penser
que le caractère neutre originaire du
navire est complètement effacé, de telle
sorte qu'il doive être traité comme s'il
avait toujours été ennemi. Le navire
peut soutenir que la prétention élevée
contre lui n'est pas fondée, que l'acte
qui lui est reproché n'a pas le caractère
d'une assistance hostile. Il a donc le
droit de recourir à la juridiction internationale
en vertu des dispositions qui
protègent les propriétés neutres.</p>

<p class="center">Article 45.</p>

<p><i>Un navire neutre est confisqué et, d'une
manière générale, passible du traitement
que subirait un navire neutre sujet à confiscation
pour contrebande de guerre:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Lorsqu'il voyage spécialement en
vue du transport de passagers individuels
incorporés dans la force armée
de l'ennemi, ou en vue de la transmission
de nouvelles dans l'intérêt de
l'ennemi.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Lorsqu'à la connaissance soit du
propriétaire, soit de celui qui a affrété
le navire en totalité, soit du capitaine,
il transporte un détachement militaire
de l'ennemi ou une ou plusieurs personnes
qui, pendant le voyage, prêtent
une assistance directe aux opérations
de l'ennemi.</i></p>

<p><i>Dans les cas visés aux numéros précédents,
les marchandises appartenant au
propriétaire du navire sont également
sujettes à confiscation.</i></p>

<p><i>Les dispositions du présent article ne
s'appliquent pas si, lorsque le navire est
rencontré en mer, il ignore les hostilités, ou
si le capitaine, après avoir appris l'ouverture
des hostilités, n'a pu encore débarquer
les personnes transportées. Le
navire est réputé connaître l'état de guerre
lorsqu'il a quitté un port ennemi après
l'ouverture des hostilités ou un port neutre
postérieurement à la notification en temps
utile de l'ouverture des hostilités à la
Puissance dont relève ce port.</i></p>

<p>Le premier cas suppose des passagers
voyageant <i>individuellement</i>; le cas
d'un <i>détachement militaire</i> est visé ci-après.
Il s'agit d'individus <i>incorporés</i>
dans la force armée de terre ou de mer
de l'ennemi. Il y a eu quelque hésitation
sur le sens de l'<i>incorporation</i> qui
est prévue. Comprend-elle seulement
les individus qui, appelés à servir en
vertu de la loi de leur pays, ont effectivement
rejoint le corps dont ils doivent
faire partie? ou comprend-elle
même ces individus dès qu'ils sont
appelés et avant qu'ils aient rejoint leur
corps? La question a une grande importance
pratique. Que l'on suppose
des individus originaires d'un pays de
l'Europe continentale et établis en
Amérique; ces individus sont tenus à
des obligations militaires envers leur
pays d'origine; ils doivent, par exemple,
faire partie de la réserve de
l'armée active de ce pays. Leur patrie
étant en guerre, ils s'embarquent pour
aller faire leur service. Seront-ils considérés
comme <i>incorporés</i> pour l'application
de la disposition dont nous nous
occupons? Si on s'attachait à la
législation intérieure de certains pays,
l'affirmation pourrait être soutenue.
Mais, indépendamment des raisons
purement juridiques, l'opinion contraire
a paru plus conforme aux nécessités
pratiques et, dans un esprit de
conciliation, elle a été acceptée par
tous. Il serait difficile, ou peut-être
même impossible, de distinguer, sans
des mesures vexatoires que les Gouvernements
neutres n'accepteraient
pas, entre les passagers d'un navire,
ceux qui sont tenus d'un service militaire,
et qui voyagent pour y satisfaire.</p>

<p>La transmission de nouvelles dans
l'intérêt de l'ennemi est assimilée au
transport de passagers incorporés dans
sa force armée. On parle du navire
qui voyage <i>spécialement</i> pour indiquer
qu'il ne s'agit pas du service normal du
navire. Il s'est détourné de sa route;
il a relâché dans un port où il ne s'arrête
pas ordinairement, pour effectuer le
transport en question. Il n'est pas
nécessaire qu'il soit <i>exclusivement</i>
affecté au service de l'ennemi; ce
dernier cas rentrerait dans la seconde
catégorie, article 56, 4<span class="topnum">o</span>.</p>

<p>Dans les deux hypothèses dont il
vient d'être parlé, il s'agit d'une opération
isolée faite par le navire; il a
été chargé d'effectuer tel transport ou
de transmettre telles nouvelles; il
n'est pas attaché d'une manière continue
au service de l'ennemi. Il en
résulte qu'il peut bien être saisi pendant
le voyage où il se livre à l'opération
qui lui est confiée; ce voyage
terminé, tout est fini en ce sens qu'il
ne pourrait être saisi pour avoir fait
l'opération prévue; c'est analogue à
ce qui est admis en matière de contrebande
(article 38).</p>

<p>Le deuxième cas se subdivise également.</p>

<p>Transport d'un détachement militaire
de l'ennemi ou transport d'une
ou de plusieurs personnes qui, pendant
le voyage, prêtent une assistance directe
aux opérations de l'ennemi, par exemple
en faisant des signaux. S'il
s'agit de militaires ou de marins en
uniforme, il n'y a pas de difficulté: le
navire est évidemment confiscable.
S'il s'agit de militaires ou de marins en
costume civil pouvant être pris pour
des passagers ordinaires, on exige la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span>
connaissance du capitaine ou du propriétaire,
celui qui a affrété le navire
en totalité étant assimilé au propriétaire.
La règle est la même pour
l'hypothèse des personnes prêtant une
assistance directe à l'ennemi pendant
le voyage.</p>

<p>Dans ces cas, si le navire est confisqué
à raison de son assistance hostile, l'on
doit confisquer également les marchandises
appartenant au propriétaire du
navire.</p>

<p>Ces dispositions supposent que l'état
de guerre était connu du navire qui se
livre aux opérations prévues; cette
connaissance motive et justifie la confiscation.
La situation est tout autre
lorsque le navire ignore l'ouverture des
hostilités, de telle sorte qu'il s'est
chargé de l'opération en temps normal.
Il a pu apprendre en mer l'ouverture
des hostilités, mais sans pouvoir débarquer
les personnes transportées.
La confiscation serait alors injuste, et
la règle équitable qui a été adoptée est
d'accord avec les dispositions déjà acceptées
dans d'autres matières. Si le
navire a quitté un port ennemi après
l'ouverture des hostilités, ou un port
neutre après que l'ouverture des hostilités
avait été notifiée à la Puissance
d'où relève ce port, la connaissance de
l'état de guerre sera présumée.</p>

<p>Il n'est question ici que d'empêcher
la confiscation du navire. Les personnes
trouvées à bord et qui font
partie des forces armées de l'ennemi
pourront être prises par le croiseur
comme prisonniers de guerre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 46.</p>

<p class="blockquot">4<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Lorsqu'il est actuellement et exclusivement
affecté, soit au transport de
troupes ennemies, soit à la transmission
de nouvelles dans l'intérêt de
l'ennemi.</i></p>

<p><i>Dans les cas visés par le présent article,
les marchandises appartenant au propriétaire
du navire sont également sujettes à
confiscation.</i></p>

<p>Les cas prévus ici sont plus graves
que ceux de l'article 45, ce qui justifie
le traitement plus sévère infligé au
navire, ainsi qu'il a été expliqué plus
haut.</p>

<p><i>Premier cas.</i>&mdash;Le navire prend une
part directe aux hostilités. Cela peut
se présenter sous diverses formes. Il
va sans dire que, s'il y a lutte armée,
le navire est exposé à tous les risques
d'une pareille lutte. On suppose qu'il
est tombé au pouvoir de l'ennemi qu'il
combattait, et qui est autorisé à le
traiter comme un navire de commerce
ennemi.</p>

<p><i>Deuxième cas.</i>&mdash;Le navire est sous les
ordres ou sous le contrôle d'un agent
placé à bord par le Gouvernement ennemi.
Cette présence caractérise le
lien qui existe entre l'ennemi et le
navire. Dans d'autres circonstances,
le navire peut bien avoir un lien avec
l'ennemi; mais pour être sujet à la
confiscation, il faudrait alors qu'il
rentrât dans le troisième cas.</p>

<p><i>Troisième cas.</i>&mdash;Le navire est affrété
en totalité par le Gouvernement ennemi.
Il est donc complètement à la
disposition de ce Gouvernement, qui
peut s'en servir pour des buts divers se
rattachant plus ou moins directement
à la guerre, notamment pour effectuer
des transports; c'est la situation de
navires charbonniers qui accompagnent
une flotte belligérante. Souvent
il y aura une charte-partie entre le
Gouvernement belligérant et le propriétaire
ou le capitaine du navire;
mais il n'y a là qu'une question de
preuve. Le fait de l'affrètement en
totalité suffit, de quelque façon qu'il
soit établi.</p>

<p><i>Quatrième cas.</i>&mdash;Le navire est actuellement
et exclusivement affecté, soit
au transport de troupes ennemies, soit
à la transmission de nouvelles dans
l'intérêt de l'ennemi. A la différence
des cas visés dans l'article 45, il s'agit
ici d'un service permanent auquel est
affecté le navire. Aussi faut-il décider
que, tant que l'affectation dure, le
navire est saisissable, encore qu'au moment
où un croiseur ennemi visite le
navire, celui-ci ne transporte pas de
troupes ou ne serve pas à la transmission
de nouvelles.</p>

<p>Comme pour les cas de l'article 45,
et par les mêmes raisons, les marchandises
appartenant au propriétaire du
navire, et qui pourraient se trouver à
bord, sont également sujettes à confiscation.</p>

<p>On avait proposé de considérer
comme navire de commerce ennemi le
navire neutre faisant actuellement et
avec l'autorisation du Gouvernement
ennemi un trajet auquel il n'a été
autorisé qu'après l'ouverture des hostilités
ou dans les deux mois qui l'ont
précédée. Cela se serait appliqué notamment
aux navires de commerce
neutres qui seraient admis par un belligérant
à une navigation réservée en
temps de paix à la marine nationale de
ce belligérant&mdash;par exemple, au cabotage.
Plusieurs Délégations ont repoussé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
formellement cette proposition,
de sorte que la question ainsi soulevée
est restée entière.</p>

<p class="center">Article 47.</p>

<p><i>Tout individu incorporé dans la force
armée de l'ennemi et qui sera trouvé à
bord d'un navire de commerce neutre,
pourra être fait prisonnier de guerre,
quand même il n'y aurait pas lieu de
saisir ce navire.</i></p>

<p>Des individus incorporés dans les
forces armées de terre ou de mer d'un
belligérant peuvent se trouver à bord
d'un navire de commerce neutre visité.
Si le navire est sujet à confiscation, le
croiseur le saisira et le conduira dans
un de ses ports avec les personnes qui
se trouvent à bord. Évidemment les
militaires ou marins de l'État ennemi
ne seront pas laissés libres, mais seront
considérés comme prisonniers de guerre.
Il peut arriver que l'on ne soit pas dans
le cas de saisir le navire&mdash;par exemple,
parce que le capitaine ne connaissait
pas la qualité d'un individu qui s'était
présenté comme un simple passager.
Faut-il alors laisser libre le ou les militaires
qui sont sur le navire? Cela n'a
pas paru admissible. Le croiseur belligérant
ne peut être contraint de laisser
libres des ennemis actifs qui sont matériellement
en son pouvoir et qui sont
plus dangereux que tels et tels articles
de contrebande; naturellement il doit
agir avec une grande discrétion, et c'est
sous sa responsabilité qu'il exige la remise
de ces individus, mais son droit
existe; aussi a-t-il été jugé nécessaire
de s'expliquer sur ce point.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre IV.</span>&mdash;<i>De la destruction des
prises neutres.</i></p>

<p>La destruction des prises neutres était
à l'ordre du jour de la Deuxième Conférence
de la Paix et n'a pu y être réglée.
Elle se retrouve à l'ordre du jour de la
présente Conférence et, cette fois, un
accord a été possible. Il y a lieu de
s'applaudir d'un pareil résultat qui témoigne
d'un sincère désir d'entente de
la part de tous. On a constaté ici, une
fois de plus, que des formules tranchantes
et opposées ne répondent pas
toujours à la réalité et que, si on veut
descendre dans le détail et arriver aux
applications précises, on aura souvent
à peu près la même manière de faire,
quoiqu'on ait paru se réclamer d'opinions
tout à fait contraires. Pour s'accorder,
il faut d'abord se bien comprendre,
ce qui n'est pas toujours le
cas. Ainsi, on a constaté que ceux qui
proclamaient le droit de détruire les
prises neutres, ne prétendaient pas
user de ce droit capricieusement et à
tout propos, mais seulement d'une
manière exceptionnelle, et qu'à l'inverse,
ceux qui affirmaient le principe
de l'interdiction de la destruction, admettaient
que ce principe devait céder
dans des cas exceptionnels. Il s'agissait
donc de s'entendre sur ces cas exceptionnels
auxquels, dans les deux opinions,
devait se borner le droit de destruction.
Ce n'était pas tout: il
fallait aussi une garantie contre les abus
dans l'exercice de ce droit; l'arbitraire
dans l'appréciation des cas exceptionnels
devait être diminué au moyen
d'une responsabilité effective imposée
au capteur. C'est ici qu'est intervenu,
dans le règlement de l'affaire, un élément
nouveau, grâce auquel l'accord a
pu se faire. L'intervention possible de
la justice fera réfléchir le capteur en
même temps qu'elle assurera une réparation
dans le cas d'une destruction
sans motif.</p>

<p>Tel est l'esprit général des dispositions
de ce chapitre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 48.</p>

<p><i>Un navire neutre saisi ne peut être détruit
par le capteur, mais il doit être conduit
dans tel port qu'il appartiendra pour
y être statué ce que de droit sur la validité
de la capture.</i></p>

<p>Le principe général est très simple.
Un navire neutre saisi ne peut être
détruit par le capteur; cela peut être
admis par tout le monde, quelle que
soit la manière dont on envisage l'effet
de la saisie. Le navire doit être conduit
dans un port pour y être statué
sur la validité de la prise. Il sera ou
non amariné suivant les cas.</p>

<p class="center">Article 49.</p>

<p><i>Par exception, un navire neutre, saisi
par un bâtiment belligérant et qui serait
sujet à confiscation, peut être détruit, si
l'observation de l'article 48 peut compromettre
la sécurité du bâtiment de
guerre ou le succès des opérations dans
lesquelles celui-ci est actuellement engagé.</i></p>

<p>La première condition pour que le
navire saisi puisse être détruit est qu'il
soit susceptible de confiscation d'après
les circonstances. Si le capteur ne
peut pas même songer à obtenir la
confiscation du navire, comment pourrait-il
avoir la prétention de le détruire?</p>

<p>La seconde est que l'observation du
principe général soit de nature à compromettre
la sécurité du bâtiment de
guerre ou le succès des opérations dans
lesquelles il est actuellement engagé.
C'est la formule à laquelle on s'est
arrêté après quelques tâtonnements.
Il a été entendu que <i>compromettre la
sécurité</i> était synonyme de mettre en
danger la navire, et pourrait être
traduit en anglais par <i>involve danger</i>.
C'est naturellement au moment où a
lieu la destruction qu'il faut se placer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span>
pour voir si les conditions sont ou non
remplies. Le danger qui n'existait
pas au moment même de la saisie peut
s'être manifesté quelque temps après.</p>

<p class="center">Article 50.</p>

<p><i>Avant la destruction, les personnes qui
se trouvent à bord devront être mises en
sûreté, et tous les papiers de bord et autres
pièces, que les intéressés estimeront utiles
pour le jugement sur la validité de la
capture, devront être transbordés sur le
bâtiment de guerre.</i></p>

<p>La disposition prévoit des précautions
à prendre dans l'intérêt des personnes
et dans celui de l'administration
de la justice.</p>

<p class="center">Article 51.</p>

<p><i>Le capteur qui a détruit un navire
neutre doit, préalablement à tout jugement
sur la validité de la capture, justifier
en fait n'avoir agi qu'en présence d'une
nécessité exceptionnelle, comme elle est
prévue à l'article 49. Faute par lui de
ce faire, il est tenu à indemnité vis-à-vis
des intéressés, sans qu'il y ait à rechercher
si la capture était valable ou non.</i></p>

<p>Ce texte donne une garantie contre
la destruction arbitraire des prises par
l'établissement d'une responsabilité
effective du capteur qui a opéré la destruction.
Ce capteur doit, en effet,
avant tout jugement sur la validité de
la prise, justifier en fait qu'il était bien
dans un des cas exceptionnels qui sont
prévus. La justification sera faite contradictoirement
avec le neutre qui, s'il
n'est pas content de la décision du
tribunal national des prises, pourra se
pourvoir devant la juridiction internationale.
Cette justification est donc
une condition préalable à remplir par
le capteur. S'il ne le fait pas, il doit
indemniser les intéressés au navire et
au chargement, sans qu'il y ait à rechercher
si la prise était valable ou
nulle. Il y a donc là une sanction
sérieuse de l'obligation de ne détruire
la prise que dans des cas déterminés,
c'est une peine pécuniaire qui frappe
le capteur. Si, au contraire, la justification
est faite, le procès de prise se
suit comme à l'ordinaire; lorsque la
prise est déclarée valable, aucune indemnité
n'est due; quand elle est déclarée
nulle, les intéressés ont droit à
être indemnisés. Le recours devant la
Cour Internationale ne peut être formé
que quand la décision du tribunal des
prises est intervenue sur le fond et non
pas aussitôt après que la question préalable
a été jugée.</p>

<p class="center">Article 52.</p>

<p><i>Si la capture d'un navire neutre, dont
la destruction a été justifiée, est ensuite
déclarée nulle, le capteur doit indemniser
les intéressés en remplacement de la restitution
à laquelle ils auraient droit.</i></p>

<p class="center">Article 53.</p>

<p><i>Si des marchandises neutres qui
n'étaient pas susceptibles de confiscation
ont été détruites avec le navire, le propriétaire
de ces marchandises a droit à
une indemnité.</i></p>

<p>Le navire détruit contenait des marchandises
neutres non susceptibles de
confiscation; le propriétaire de ces
marchandises a, en tout cas, droit à
une indemnité, c'est-à-dire sans qu'il
y ait à distinguer suivant que la destruction
était ou non justifiée. C'est
équitable et c'est une garantie de plus
contre une destruction arbitraire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 54.</p>

<p><i>Le capteur a la faculté d'exiger la remise
ou de procéder à la destruction des
marchandises confiscables trouvées à bord
d'un navire qui lui-même n'est pas sujet
à confiscation, lorsque les circonstances
sont telles que, d'après l'article 49, elles
justifieraient la destruction d'un navire
passible de confiscation. Il mentionne
les objets livrés ou détruits sur le livre de
bord du navire arrêté et se fait remettre
par le capitaine copie certifiée conforme
de tous papiers utiles. Lorsque la remise
ou la destruction a été effectuée et
que les formalités ont été remplies, le
capitaine doit être autorisé à continuer
sa route.</i></p>

<p><i>Les dispositions des articles 51 et 52
concernant la responsabilité du capteur
qui a détruit un navire neutre sont
applicables.</i></p>

<p>Un croiseur rencontre un navire de
commerce neutre portant de la contrebande
dans une proportion inférieure à
celle qui est prévue par l'article 40. Il
peut amariner le navire et le conduire
dans un port pour y être jugé. Il peut,
conformément à ce qui est réglé par
l'article 44, accepter la remise de la
contrebande qui lui est offerte par le
navire arrêté. Mais, qu'arrivera-t-il si
aucune de ces solutions n'intervient?
Le navire arrêté n'offre pas de remettre
la contrebande et le croiseur n'est pas
en situation de conduire le navire dans
un de ses ports. Le croiseur est-il
obligé de laisser aller un navire neutre
avec la contrebande qu'il porte? Cela
a paru excessif, au moins dans certaines
circonstances exceptionnelles. Ce sont
celles-là mêmes qui justifieraient la destruction
du navire, s'il était susceptible
de confiscation. En pareil cas,
le croiseur pourra exiger la remise ou
procéder à la destruction des marchandises
confiscables. Les raisons qui ont
fait admettre la destruction du navire
pourront justifier la destruction des
marchandises de contrebande, d'autant
plus que les considérations d'humanité
qui peuvent être invoquées en cas de
destruction du navire sont écartées ici.
Contre une exigence arbitraire du croiseur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>
il y a les mêmes garanties qui ont
permis de reconnaître la faculté de
détruire le navire. Le croiseur doit
préalablement justifier qu'il se trouvait
bien dans les circonstances exceptionnelles
prévues; sinon, il est
condamné à la valeur des marchandises
livrées ou détruites, sans qu'il y
ait à rechercher si elles constituaient
ou non de la contrebande de guerre.</p>

<p>La disposition prescrit des formalités
qui sont nécessaires pour constater le
fait même et pour mettre la juridiction
des prises à même de statuer.</p>

<p>Naturellement, une fois que la remise
a été effectuée ou que la destruction
a été opérée et que les formalités
ont été remplies, le navire arrêté doit
être laissé libre de continuer sa route.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre V.</span>&mdash;<i>Du transfert de
pavillon.</i></p>

<p>Un navire de commerce ennemi est
sujet à capture, tandis qu'un navire de
commerce neutre est respecté. On
comprend, dès lors, qu'un croiseur belligérant,
rencontrant un navire de commerce
qui se réclame d'une nationalité
neutre, ait à rechercher si cette nationalité
a été légitimement acquise ou si
elle n'a pas eu pour but de soustraire
le navire aux risques auxquels il aurait
été exposé s'il avait gardé son ancienne
nationalité. La question se présente
naturellement quand le transfert est de
date relativement récente, au moment
où a lieu la visite, que ce transfert soit,
du reste, antérieur ou postérieur à l'ouverture
des hostilités. Elle est résolue
différemment suivant qu'on se place
plutôt au point de vue de l'intérêt du
commerce ou plutôt au point de vue
de l'intérêt des belligérants. Il est
heureux que l'on se soit entendu sur
un règlement qui concilie les deux
intérêts dans la mesure du possible et
qui renseigne les belligérants et le
commerce neutre.</p>

<p class="center">Article 55.</p>

<p><i>La transfert sous pavillon neutre d'un
navire ennemi, effectué avant l'ouverture
des hostilités, est valable à moins qu'il
soit établi que ce transfert a été effectué
en vue d'éluder les conséquences qu'entraîne
le caractère de navire ennemi. Il
y a néanmoins présomption de nullité si
l'acte de transfert ne se trouve pas à bord,
alors que le navire a perdu la nationalité
belligérante moins de soixante jours
avant l'ouverture des hostilités; la preuve
contraire est admise.</i></p>

<p><i>Il y a présomption absolue de validité
d'un transfert effectué plus de trente jours
avant l'ouverture des hostilités, s'il est
absolu, complet, conforme à la législation
des pays intéressés, et s'il a cet effet que
le contrôle du navire et le bénéfice de son
emploi ne restent pas entre les mêmes
mains qu'avant le transfert. Toutefois,
si le navire a perdu la nationalité belligérante
moins de soixante jours avant
l'ouverture des hostilités et si l'acte de
transfert ne se trouve pas à bord, la saisie
du navire ne pourra donner lieu à des
dommages et intérêts.</i></p>

<p>La règle générale, posée par l'alinéa
1<span class="topnum">er</span>, est que le transfert sous pavillon
neutre d'un navire ennemi est valable,
en supposant, bien entendu, que les
conditions juridiques ordinaires de validité
ont été remplies. C'est au capteur,
s'il veut faire annuler ce transfert, à
établir que le transfert a eu pour but
d'éluder les conséquences de la guerre
que l'on prévoyait. Il y a un cas considéré
comme suspect, celui dans lequel
l'acte de transfert ne se trouve pas à
bord, alors que le navire a changé de
nationalité moins de soixante jours
avant l'ouverture des hostilités. La
présomption de validité établie au
profit du navire par l'alinéa 1<span class="topnum">er</span> est
renversée au profit du capteur. Il y
a présomption de nullité du transfert,
mais la preuve contraire est admise.
Il peut être prouvé, pour l'écarter, que
le transfert n'a pas été opéré en vue
d'éluder les conséquences de la guerre;
il va sans dire que les conditions juridiques
ordinaires de validité doivent
avoir été remplies.</p>

<p>On a voulu donner au commerce
cette garantie que le droit de faire considérer
un transfert comme nul pour ce
motif qu'il aurait eu pour but d'éluder
les conséquences de la guerre ne s'étendrait
pas trop loin et ne comprendrait
pas une période trop étendue. En
conséquence, si le transfert a été
effectué plus de trente jours avant l'ouverture
des hostilités, il ne peut être
attaqué pour cette seule cause, et il est
considéré comme absolument valable,
s'il a été fait dans des conditions qui
en démontrent le caractère sérieux et
définitif et qui sont les suivantes: le
transfert doit être absolu, complet, et
conforme à la législation des pays intéressés
et il a pour effet de mettre le
contrôle et les bénéfices du navire entre
d'autres mains. Ces conditions établies,
le capteur n'est pas admis à prétendre
que le vendeur prévoyait la
guerre dans laquelle son pays allait
être engagé et voulait, par la vente, se
soustraire aux risques qu'elle lui aurait
fait courir pour les navires dont il
opérait le transfert. Si, même dans
cette hypothèse, le navire est rencontré
par un croiseur et qu'il n'ait pas l'acte
de transfert à bord, il pourra être saisi
lorsque le changement de nationalité
a eu lieu moins de soixante jours avant
l'ouverture des hostilités; cette circonstance
le rend suspect. Mais si,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>
devant la juridiction des prises, il fait
les justifications prévues par l'alinéa 2,
il doit être relâché; seulement il ne
pourra obtenir des dommages et intérêts,
attendu qu'il y avait eu motif
suffisant pour saisir le navire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 56.</p>

<p><i>Le transfert sous pavillon neutre d'un
navire ennemi, effectué après l'ouverture
des hostilités, est nul, à moins qu'il soit
établi que ce transfert n'a pas été effectué
en vue d'éluder les conséquences qu'entraîne
le caractère de navire ennemi.</i></p>

<p><i>Toutefois, il y a présomption absolue
de nullité:</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">1<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Si le transfert a été effectué pendant
que le navire est en voyage ou dans
un port bloqué.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">2<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>S'il y a faculté de réméré ou de
retour.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot">3<span class="topnum">o</span> <i>Si les conditions, auxquelles est
soumis le droit de pavillon d'après la
législation du pavillon arboré, n'ont
pas été observées.</i></p>

<p>Pour le <i>transfert postérieur à l'ouverture
des hostilités</i>, la règle est plus
simple: le transfert n'est valable que
s'il est établi qu'il n'a pas eu pour but
d'éluder les conséquences qu'entraîne le
caractère de navire ennemi. C'est la
solution inverse de celle qui est admise
pour le transfert antérieur à l'ouverture
des hostilités; présomption de
validité dans ce dernier, présomption
de nullité dans celui dont il s'agit
maintenant, sauf la possibilité de faire
la preuve contraire. Il pourrait être
établi, par exemple, que le transfert est
la suite d'une transmission héréditaire.</p>

<p>L'article 56 indique des cas dans
lesquels la présomption de nullité est
absolue pour des motifs qui se comprennent
aisément: dans le premier, le
lien entre le transfert et le risque de
guerre couru par le navire apparaît
clairement; dans le second, l'acquéreur
se présente comme un prête-nom devant
être considéré comme propriétaire
du navire pendant une période dangereuse,
après laquelle le vendeur reprendra
son navire; enfin, le troisième cas
aurait pu à la rigueur être sous-entendu,
le navire qui se réclame d'une nationalité
neutre devant naturellement justifier
qu'il a droit à cette nationalité.</p>

<p>On avait d'abord prévu le cas où le
navire est, après le transfert, maintenu
dans le service auquel il était affecté
auparavant. Il y a là une circonstance
suspecte au plus haut point; le transfert
paraît fictif, puisque rien n'est
changé dans le service du navire. Cela
s'applique, par exemple, au cas d'une
même ligne de navigation desservie par
le navire après et avant le transfert.
On a objecté que, parfois, la présomption
absolue serait trop rigoureuse, que
certains navires, comme les navires
pétroliers, ne pouvaient, à raison de
leur construction, être affectés qu'à un
service déterminé. Pour tenir compte
de cette observation, le mot <i>trajet</i> avait
été ajouté, de sorte qu'il aurait fallu
que le navire eût été maintenu <i>dans les
mêmes service et trajet</i>; il semblait que
l'on donnait, de cette façon, une satisfaction
suffisante à la réclamation.
Néanmoins, sur une insistance en vue
de la suppression du cas dans l'énumération,
cette suppression a été admise.
Il en résulte que le transfert rentre
alors dans l'application de la règle
générale; il est bien présumé nul, mais
la preuve contraire est admise.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre VI.</span>&mdash;<i>Du caractère ennemi.</i></p>

<p>La règle inscrite dans la Déclaration
de Paris, "le pavillon neutre couvre la
marchandise ennemie, à l'exception de
la contrebande de guerre," répond trop
au progrès des m&oelig;urs, a trop pénétré
l'opinion publique pour qu'en présence
d'une application si générale, on n'y
voie pas un principe de droit commun,
qu'il n'est plus même question de discuter.
Aussi le caractère neutre ou
ennemi des navires de commerce n'a-t-il
pas seulement pour conséquence de
décider de la validité de leur capture,
mais encore du sort des marchandises,
autres que la contrebande, qui sont
trouvées à leur bord. Une remarque
générale analogue peut être faite au
sujet du caractère neutre ou ennemi de
la marchandise. Personne ne songe à
contester aujourd'hui le principe d'après
lequel, "la marchandise neutre, à l'exception
de la contrebande de guerre, n'est
pas saisissable sous pavillon ennemi."
Ce n'est donc que dans le cas où elle
est trouvée à bord d'un navire ennemi,
que se pose la question de savoir si
une marchandise est neutre ou ennemie.</p>

<p>La détermination du caractère neutre
ou ennemi apparaît ainsi comme le développement
des deux principes consacrés
en 1856, ou mieux comme le
moyen d'en assurer la juste application
pratique.</p>

<p>L'utilité de dégager, à cet égard, des
pratiques des différents pays des règles
claires et simples n'a, pour ainsi dire,
pas besoin d'être démontrée. Pour le
commerce, l'incertitude des risques de
capture, si elle n'est pas une cause
d'arrêt total, est tout au moins la pire
des entraves. Le commerçant doit
savoir les risques qu'il court en chargeant
sur tel ou tel navire; l'assureur,
s'il ignore la gravité de ces risques, est
forcé d'exiger des primes de guerre souvent
exorbitantes ou insuffisantes.</p>

<p>Les règles qui forment ce chapitre ne
sont malheureusement pas complètes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
quelques points importants ont dû
être laissés de côté, comme on l'a déjà
vu par ce qui a été dit dans les explications
préliminaires et comme cela sera
précisé plus loin.</p>

<p class="center">Article 57.</p>

<p><i>Sous réserve des dispositions relatives
au transfert de pavillon, le caractère
neutre ou ennemi du navire est déterminé
par le pavillon qu'il a le droit de
porter.</i></p>

<p><i>Le cas où le navire neutre se livre à
une navigation réservée en temps de paix
reste hors de cause et n'est nullement visé
par cette règle.</i></p>

<p>Le principe est donc que <i>le caractère
neutre ou ennemi du navire est déterminé
par le pavillon qu'il a le droit de porter</i>.
C'est une règle simple qui paraît bien
répondre à la situation spéciale des
navires, si on les compare aux autres
biens meubles et notamment aux marchandises.
A plus d'un point de vue,
ils ont une sorte d'individualité; notamment
ils ont une nationalité, un
<i>caractère</i> national. Cette nationalité
est manifestée par le droit de pavillon;
elle place les navires sous la protection
et le contrôle de l'État dont ils relèvent;
elle les soumet à la souveraineté
et aux lois de cet État et, le cas échéant,
à ses réquisitions. C'est là le critérium
le plus sûr que le navire est bien un des
éléments de la force maritime marchande
d'un pays et, par conséquent,
le meilleur critérium pour déterminer
s'il est neutre ou ennemi. Aussi convient-il
de s'y attacher exclusivement
et d'écarter ce qui se rattache à la personnalité
du propriétaire.</p>

<p>Le texte dit: le pavillon que le
navire a le <i>droit de porter</i>; cela s'entend
naturellement du pavillon que le navire
est, s'il ne l'a fait, en droit d'arborer,
conformément aux lois qui régissent le
port de ce pavillon.</p>

<p>L'article 57 réserve les dispositions
relatives au transfert de pavillon pour
lesquelles il suffit de renvoyer aux
articles 55 et 56; il pourra se faire qu'un
navire ait bien le droit de porter un
pavillon neutre, au point de vue de la
législation du pays dont il se réclame,
mais soit considéré comme ennemi par
un belligérant, parce que le transfert à
la suite duquel il a porté le pavillon
neutre tombe sous le coup de l'article
55 ou de l'article 56.</p>

<p>Enfin, la question de savoir si un
navire perd son caractère neutre, lorsqu'il
effectue une navigation que l'ennemi
réservait avant la guerre aux seuls
navires nationaux a été soulevée. Une
entente n'a pu avoir lieu, comme cela
a été expliqué plus haut à propos du
chapitre sur <i>l'Assistance hostile</i>, et la
question est restée absolument entière,
comme l'alinéa 2 de l'article 57 prend
soin de le dire.</p>

<p class="center">Article 58.</p>

<p><i>Le caractère neutre ou ennemi des
marchandises trouvées à bord d'un navire
ennemi est déterminé par le caractère
neutre ou ennemi de leur propriétaire.</i></p>

<p>A la différence des navires, les marchandises
n'ont pas une individualité
propre; on fait dépendre leur caractère
neutre ou ennemi de la personnalité
de leur propriétaire. C'est ce
qui a prévalu après un examen approfondi
de diverses opinions tendant à
s'attacher à l'origine des marchandises,
à la personne du porteur de risques, du
réclamateur ou de l'expéditeur. Le
critérium adopté par l'article 58 paraît,
d'ailleurs, conforme aux termes de la
Déclaration de Paris comme à ceux de
la Convention de La Haye du 18
octobre 1907, sur l'établissement d'une
Cour Internationale des prises, où il est
parlé des <i>propriétés neutres ou ennemies</i>
(articles 1, 3, 4 et 8).</p>

<p>Mais il ne faut pas se dissimuler que
l'article 58 ne résout qu'une partie du
problème, la plus simple; c'est le
caractère neutre ou ennemi du propriétaire
qui détermine le caractère des
marchandises, mais à quoi s'attachera-t-on
pour déterminer le caractère neutre
ou ennemi du propriétaire? On ne le
dit pas, parce qu'il a été impossible
d'arriver à une entente sur ce point.
Les opinions ont été partagées entre le
<i>domicile</i> et la <i>nationalité</i>; il est inutile de
reproduire ici les arguments invoqués
dans les deux sens. On avait pensé à
une sorte de transaction ainsi formulée:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Le caractère neutre ou ennemi
des marchandises trouvées à bord
d'un navire ennemi est déterminé par
la nationalité neutre ou ennemie de
leur propriétaire et, en cas d'absence
de nationalité ou en cas de double
nationalité neutre et ennemie de leur
propriétaire, par le domicile de celui-ci
en pays neutre ou ennemi."</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Toutefois, les marchandises appartenant
à une société anonyme ou
par actions sont considérées comme
neutres ou ennemies selon que la
société a son siège social en pays
neutre ou ennemi."</p>

<p>L'unanimité n'a pu être obtenue.</p>

<p class="center">Article 59.</p>

<p><i>Si le caractère neutre de la marchandise
trouvée à bord d'un navire ennemi
n'est pas établi, la marchandise est présumée
ennemie.</i></p>

<p>L'article 59 formule la règle traditionnelle
d'après laquelle la marchandise
trouvée à bord d'un navire ennemi est
présumée ennemie sauf la preuve contraire;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>
ce n'est qu'une présomption
simple laissant au revendiquant le droit,
mais la charge de prouver ses droits.</p>

<p class="center">Article 60.</p>

<p><i>Le caractère ennemi de la marchandise
chargée à bord d'un navire ennemi subsiste
jusqu'à l'arrivée à destination, nonobstant
un transfert intervenu pendant le
cours de l'expédition, après l'ouverture
des hostilités.</i></p>

<p><i>Toutefois, si, antérieurement à la capture,
un précédent propriétaire neutre
exerce, en cas de faillite du propriétaire
ennemi actuel, un droit de revendication
légale sur la marchandise, celle-ci reprend
le caractère neutre.</i></p>

<p>Cette disposition envisage le cas où
une marchandise, étant propriété ennemie
au moment de son départ, a été
l'objet d'une vente ou d'un transfert
pendant le cours du voyage. La
facilité qu'il y aurait à garantir, au
moyen d'une vente, la marchandise
ennemie contre l'exercice du droit de
capture, sauf à s'en faire rétrocéder la
propriété à l'arrivée, a toujours conduit
à ne pas tenir compte de ces transferts;
le caractère ennemi subsiste.</p>

<p>Au point de vue du moment à partir
duquel une marchandise doit être considérée
comme devant prendre et conserver
le caractère ennemi de son propriétaire,
le texte est inspiré du même
esprit d'équité qui a présidé à la Convention
de La Haye sur le régime des
bâtiments de commerce au début des
hostilités, et du même désir de garantir
les opérations entreprises dans la confiance
du temps de paix. C'est seulement
lorsque le transfert a lieu après
l'ouverture des hostilités qu'il est,
jusqu'à l'arrivée, inopérant au point de
vue de la perte du caractère ennemi.
Ce qu'on considère ici, c'est la date du
transfert, et non la date du départ du
navire. Car, bien que le navire parti
avant la guerre, et resté peut-être dans
l'ignorance de l'ouverture des hostilités,
jouisse de ce chef d'une certaine exemption,
la marchandise peut cependant
avoir le caractère ennemi; le propriétaire
ennemi de cette marchandise est
à même de connaître la guerre, et c'est
précisément pour cela qu'il cherchera
à échapper à ses conséquences.</p>

<p>On a cru, toutefois, devoir ajouter
sinon une restriction, du moins un
complément jugé nécessaire. Dans un
grand nombre de pays, le vendeur non
payé a, en cas de faillite de l'acheteur, un
droit de revendication légale (<i>stoppage
in transitu</i>) sur les marchandises déjà
devenues la propriété de l'acheteur,
mais non encore parvenues jusqu'à lui.
En pareil cas la vente est résolue, et,
par l'effet de sa revendication, le vendeur
reprend sa marchandise, sans être
réputé avoir jamais cessé d'être propriétaire.
Il y a là pour le commerce
neutre, en cas de faillite non simulée,
une garantie trop précieuse pour être
sacrifiée, et le deuxième alinéa de
l'article 60 a pour but de la sauvegarder.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre VII.</span>&mdash;<i>Du convoi.</i></p>

<p>La pratique du convoi a, dans le
passé, soulevé parfois de graves difficultés
et même des conflits. Aussi
peut-on constater avec satisfaction l'accord
intervenu pour la régler.</p>

<p class="center">Article 61.</p>

<p><i>Les navires neutres sous convoi de leur
pavillon sont exempts de visite. Le commandant
du convoi donne par écrit, à la
demande du commandant d'un bâtiment
de guerre belligérant, sur le caractère des
navires et sur leur chargement, toutes informations
que la visite servirait à obtenir.</i></p>

<p>Le principe posé est simple: un
navire neutre convoyé par un navire de
guerre de sa nation est exempt de visite.
Le motif en est que le croiseur belligérant
doit trouver dans les affirmations
du commandant du convoi la garantie
que lui procurerait l'exercice même du
droit de visite; il ne peut, en effet,
révoquer en doute ces affirmations,
données par l'agent officiel d'un Gouvernement
neutre, sans manquer à la
courtoisie internationale. Si les Gouvernements
neutres laissent les belligérants
visiter les navires portant
leur pavillon, c'est qu'ils ne veulent
pas prendre la charge de la surveillance
de ces navires, et qu'alors ils permettent
aux belligérants de se protéger eux-mêmes.
La situation change quand un
Gouvernement neutre entend prendre
cette charge; le droit de visite n'a plus
la même raison d'être.</p>

<p>Mais il résulte de l'explication de la
règle donnée pour le convoi que le Gouvernement
neutre s'engage à donner
aux belligérants toute garantie que les
navires convoyés ne profitent pas de la
protection qui leur est assurée pour agir
contrairement à la neutralité&mdash;par exemple,
pour transporter de la contrebande
de guerre, pour fournir à un belligérant
une assistance hostile, pour
tenter de violer un blocus. Il faudra
donc une surveillance sérieuse exercée
au départ sur les navires devant être
convoyés, et cette surveillance devra se
poursuivre au cours du voyage. Le
Gouvernement devra procéder avec
vigilance pour empêcher tout abus du
convoi, et il donnera en ce sens des
instructions précises à l'officier chargé
de commander un convoi.</p>

<p>Un croiseur belligérant rencontre un
convoi: il s'adresse au commandant de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>
ce convoi, qui doit, sur sa demande, lui
donner par écrit toutes les informations
utiles sur les navires qui sont sous sa
protection. On exige une déclaration
écrite, parce qu'elle empêche les équivoques
et les malentendus, qu'elle engage
plus la responsabilité du commandant.
Cette déclaration a pour but de
rendre la visite inutile par le fait même
qu'elle procure au croiseur les renseignements
que la visite elle-même
lui aurait fournis.</p>

<p class="center">Article 62.</p>

<p><i>Si le commandant du bâtiment de
guerre belligérant a lieu de soupçonner
que la religion du commandant du convoi
a été surprise, il lui communique ses
soupçons. C'est au commandant du
convoi seul qu'il appartient en ce cas de
procéder à une vérification. Il doit constater
le résultat de cette vérification par
un procès-verbal dont une copie est remise
à l'officier du bâtiment de guerre. Si
des faits ainsi constatés justifient, dans
l'opinion du commandant du convoi, la
saisie d'un ou de plusieurs navires, la
protection du convoi doit leur être retirée.</i></p>

<p>Le plus souvent le croiseur s'en
tiendra à la déclaration que lui aura
donnée le commandant du convoi, mais
il peut avoir de sérieuses raisons de
croire que la religion de ce commandant
a été surprise, qu'un navire convoyé
dont les papiers paraissent en
règle, et ne présentent rien de suspect,
transporte, en fait, de la contrebande
adroitement dissimulée. Le croiseur
peut communiquer ses soupçons au
commandant du convoi. Une vérification
peut être jugée nécessaire. Elle
est faite par le commandant du convoi;
c'est lui seul qui exerce l'autorité sur
les navires placés sous sa protection.
Il a paru toutefois que l'on éviterait
souvent bien des difficultés, s'il était
permis au belligérant d'assister à cette
vérification; autrement il lui serait
toujours possible de suspecter, sinon
la bonne foi, du moins la vigilance ou
la perspicacité du visiteur. Mais on
n'a pas cru devoir imposer au commandant
du convoi l'obligation de
laisser l'officier du croiseur assister à
la vérification. Il agira comme il le
jugera bon: s'il accepte l'assistance
d'un officier du croiseur, ce sera un
acte de courtoisie ou de bonne politique.
Il devra, dans tous les cas,
dresser un procès-verbal de la vérification
et en donner une copie à l'officier
du croiseur.</p>

<p>Des divergences peuvent s'élever
entre les deux officiers, spécialement à
propos de la contrebande conditionnelle.
Le caractère du port auquel
sont destinés des blés peut être contesté;
est-ce un port de commerce
ordinaire? est-ce un port qui sert de
base de ravitaillement pour les forces
armées? La situation de fait produite
par le convoi doit être, en ce cas, maintenue.
Il pourra seulement y avoir
une protestation de la part de l'officier
du croiseur, et la difficulté sera réglée
par la voie diplomatique.</p>

<p>La situation est tout autre si un
navire convoyé est trouvé porteur de
contrebande sans qu'une contestation
puisse s'élever. Le navire n'a plus
droit à la protection, parce que la condition
à laquelle cette protection était
subordonnée n'a pas été remplie. Il
a trompé son propre Gouvernement
d'abord et essayé de tromper un belligérant.
Il doit alors être traité comme
un navire de commerce neutre qui, dans
les circonstances ordinaires, rencontre
un croiseur belligérant et est visité par
lui. Il ne peut se plaindre d'être ainsi
traité rigoureusement, parce qu'il y a
dans son cas une aggravation de la
faute commise par un transporteur de
contrebande.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre VIII.</span>&mdash;<i>De la résistance
à la visite.</i></p>

<p>Le sujet traité dans ce chapitre n'est
pas mentionné dans le programme
soumis en février 1908 par le Gouvernement
Britannique; il se rattache
étroitement à plusieurs des questions
de ce programme, aussi s'est-il naturellement
présenté à l'esprit au cours
des discussions, et il a paru nécessaire
de poser une règle sur laquelle on s'est
facilement accordé.</p>

<p>Un croiseur belligérant rencontre un
navire de commerce et le somme de
s'arrêter pour qu'il soit procédé à la
visite. Le navire sommé ne s'arrête
pas et essaie de se soustraire à la visite
par la fuite. Le croiseur peut employer
la force pour l'arrêter, et le navire de
commerce, s'il est avarié ou coulé, n'a
pas le droit de se plaindre, puisqu'il a
contrevenu à une obligation imposée
par le droit des gens. S'il est arrêté
et s'il est établi que c'est seulement
pour éviter les ennuis de la visite qu'il
avait recouru à la fuite, qu'il n'avait
d'ailleurs commis aucun acte contraire
à la neutralité, il ne sera pas puni pour
sa tentative. S'il est constaté, au
contraire, que le navire a de la contrebande
à bord ou qu'il a, d'une façon
quelconque, violé ses devoirs de neutre,
il subira les conséquences de son infraction
à la neutralité, mais il ne
subira non plus aucune peine pour
avoir tenté la fuite. Certains pensaient,
au contraire, que le navire
devrait être puni pour une tentative
de fuite caractérisée comme pour une
résistance violente. La possibilité de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span>
la confiscation engagerait, disait-on, le
croiseur à ménager, dans la mesure du
possible, le navire en fuite. Mais cette
idée n'a pas prévalu.</p>

<p class="center">Article 63.</p>

<p><i>La résistance opposée par la force à
l'exercice légitime du droit d'arrêt, de
visite et de saisie, entraîne, dans tous
les cas, la confiscation du navire. Le
chargement est passible du même traitement
que subirait le chargement d'un
navire ennemi; les marchandises appartenant
au capitaine ou au propriétaire du
navire sont considérées comme marchandises
ennemies.</i></p>

<p>La situation est différente s'il y a
résistance violente à l'action légitime
du croiseur. Le navire commet un
acte d'hostilité et doit, dès lors, être
traité en ennemi; il sera donc soumis
à confiscation, quand même la visite ne
révélerait aucun fait contraire à la neutralité,
et cela semble ne pouvoir soulever
aucune difficulté.</p>

<p>Que faut-il décider du chargement?
La formule qui a semblé la meilleure
est celle d'après laquelle ce chargement
sera traité comme celui qui serait à
bord d'un navire ennemi. Cette assimilation
entraîne les conséquences
suivantes: le navire neutre qui a résisté
devenant navire ennemi, la marchandise
se trouvant à bord est présumée
ennemie. Les neutres intéressés
pourront réclamer leur propriété, conformément
à la 3<span class="topnum">e</span> règle de la Déclaration
de Paris, mais la marchandise ennemie
sera confisquée parce que la règle
<i>le pavillon couvre la marchandise</i> ne peut
plus être invoquée, le navire saisi sur
lequel elle se trouve étant considéré
comme ennemi. On remarquera que
le droit de réclamer la marchandise est
reconnu à tous les neutres, même à
ceux qui ont la nationalité du navire
saisi; il paraîtrait excessif de les faire
souffrir de l'acte du capitaine. Il y a
toutefois une exception à l'égard des
marchandises appartenant au propriétaire
du navire. Il semble naturel qu'il
supporte les conséquences des actes de
son agent. Sa propriété à bord du
navire sera donc traitée en marchandise
ennemie. A plus forte raison, en
est-il de même de la marchandise appartenant
au capitaine.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chapitre IX.</span>&mdash;<i>Des dommages
et intérêts.</i></p>

<p>Ce chapitre a une portée très générale,
puisque la disposition qu'il contient
trouve son application dans les
cas nombreux où un croiseur peut
saisir un navire ou des marchandises.</p>

<p class="center">Article 64.</p>

<p><i>Si la saisie du navire ou des marchandises
n'est pas validée par la juridiction
des prises ou si, sans qu'il y ait eu de
mise en jugement, la saisie n'est pas
maintenue, les intéressés ont droit à des
dommages et intérêts, à moins qu'il y ait
eu des motifs suffisants de saisir le navire
ou les marchandises.</i></p>

<p>Un croiseur a saisi un navire neutre,
par exemple, pour transport de contrebande
ou violation de blocus. Le tribunal
des prises relâche le navire en
annulant la saisie. Cela ne suffit évidemment
pas à dédommager les intéressés
de la perte éprouvée par suite
de la saisie, et cette perte a pu être
considérable, puisque le navire a été,
pendant un temps souvent très long,
empêché de se livrer à son trafic ordinaire.
Peuvent-ils demander à être indemnisés
de ce préjudice? Rationnellement
il faut admettre l'affirmative, si
ce préjudice est immérité, c'est-à-dire
si la saisie n'a pas été amenée par leur
faute. Il peut arriver, en effet, que la
saisie ait été motivée, parce que le
capitaine du navire visité n'a pas produit
des justifications qui devaient se
trouver normalement à sa disposition
et qui ont été fournies plus tard. Dans
ce cas, il serait injuste que des dommages
et intérêts fussent accordés. A
l'inverse, s'il y a eu vraiment faute du
croiseur, s'il a saisi dans un cas où il
n'y avait pas de motifs suffisants de le
faire, il est juste que des dommages et
intérêts soient alloués.</p>

<p>Il peut arriver aussi qu'un navire
saisi et conduit dans un port ait été
relaxé par voie administrative sans intervention
d'un tribunal de prises. En
pareil cas, la pratique varie: dans
certains pays, la juridiction des prises
n'intervient que dans le cas d'une capture
et ne pourrait statuer sur une demande
de dommages-intérêts fondée
sur ce que la saisie aurait été injustifiée;
dans d'autres, la juridiction des prises
serait compétente pour une demande
de ce genre. Il y a là une inégalité peu
équitable et il convient d'établir une
règle qui produise le même effet dans
tous les pays. Il est raisonnable que
toute saisie pratiquée sans motifs suffisants
donne droit à des dommages-intérêts
au profit des intéressés, sans
qu'il y ait à distinguer suivant que la
saisie a été ou non suivie d'une décision
du tribunal des prises, et d'autant plus
que c'est quand la saisie aura été le
moins justifiée, que le navire pourra
être relaxé par voie administrative. On
a donc employé une formule générale
pouvant comprendre tous les cas de
saisie.</p>

<p>Il convient de remarquer que la
question de savoir si les tribunaux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>
nationaux de prises sont compétents
pour statuer sur les dommages-intérêts
n'est pas visée dans le texte. En tant
qu'il y a un procès sur les propriétés
saisies, aucun doute n'est possible.
Dans la procédure engagée sur la validité
de la capture, les intéressés auront
l'occasion de faire valoir leur droit à
une indemnité, et, si la décision du
tribunal national ne leur donne pas
satisfaction, ils pourront se pourvoir
devant la Cour Internationale des
prises. Si, au contraire, l'action du
belligérant s'est bornée à une saisie,
la législation du belligérant capteur décide
si des tribunaux sont compétents
pour connaître d'une demande en indemnité
et, en cas d'affirmative, quels
tribunaux sont compétents dans l'espèce;
la Cour Internationale n'a, dans
ce cas, aucune compétence d'après la
Convention de La Haye. Au point de
vue international, la voie diplomatique
est la seule ouverte pour faire valoir la
réclamation, qu'il s'agisse de se plaindre
d'une décision effectivement rendue ou
de suppléer à l'absence de juridiction.</p>

<p>On a posé la question de savoir s'il
y avait lieu de distinguer les dommages
directs et les dommages indirects subis
par le navire ou la marchandise. Il a
semblé qu'il valait mieux laisser la
juridiction des prises libre d'apprécier
le dédommagement dû, qui variera
suivant les circonstances et dont le
montant ne peut être déterminé à
l'avance par des règles trop minutieuses.</p>

<p>Il n'a été parlé que du navire pour
simplifier; mais ce qui a été dit s'applique
naturellement à la cargaison
saisie, puis relâchée. Ainsi la marchandise
innocente, se trouvant à bord du
navire saisi, subit tous les inconvénients
de la saisie du navire. S'il y a
eu des motifs suffisants de saisir le
navire, que cette saisie soit maintenue
ou non, les propriétaires de la cargaison
n'ont aucun droit à des dommages
et intérêts.</p>

<p>Il peut être utile d'indiquer certains
cas dans lesquels la saisie du navire
serait justifiée, quelle que pût être la
décision du tribunal des prises. C'est
notamment celui de jet, de suppression
ou de destruction volontaire de
tout ou partie des papiers de bord,
provenant du fait du capitaine, de
quelqu'un de l'équipage ou des passagers.
Il y a là quelque chose qui
justifie tous les soupçons et qui explique
que le navire soit saisi, sauf au
capitaine à rendre compte de sa conduite
devant le tribunal des prises.
Même si ce tribunal acceptait les explications
données et ne trouvait pas de
causes suffisantes de confiscation, les
intéressés ne pourraient songer à réclamer
des dommages-intérêts.</p>

<p>Un cas analogue serait celui où l'on
trouverait à bord des papiers doubles,
faux, ou falsifiés, alors que cette irrégularité
se rattache à des circonstances
de nature à influer sur la saisie
du navire.</p>

<p>Il a semblé suffisant que ces cas où
la saisie s'expliquerait raisonnablement
fussent mentionnés dans le
Rapport sans faire l'objet d'une disposition
expresse, et cela parce que
l'indication de deux cas particuliers
aurait pu faire croire que c'étaient les
seuls dans lesquels la saisie se justifierait.</p>

<p>Tels sont les principes de droit international
que la Conférence Navale
s'est efforcée de reconnaître comme
propres à régir pratiquement les rapports
des peuples dans d'importantes
matières pour lesquelles des règles précises
faisaient jusqu'à présent défaut.
Elle a continué ainsi l'&oelig;uvre de codification
commencée par la Déclaration
de Paris de 1856. Elle a travaillé dans
le même esprit que la Deuxième Conférence
de la Paix et, profitant des
travaux faits à La Haye, elle a pu résoudre
un certain nombre de problèmes
que, faute de temps, cette Conférence
avait dû laisser sans solution. Souhaitons
que l'on puisse dire que ceux
qui ont élaboré la Déclaration de
Londres de 1909 n'ont pas été trop
indignes de leurs prédécesseurs de
1856 et de 1907.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dispositions Finales.</span></p>

<p>Ces dispositions ont trait à diverses
questions qui touchent à l'effet de la

<p class="center">Article 65.</p>

<p><i>Les dispositions de la présente Déclaration
forment un ensemble indivisible.</i></p>

<p>Cet article est très important et conforme
à ce qui avait été admis pour la
Déclaration de Paris.</p>

<p>Les règles contenues dans la présente
Déclaration touchent à des points très
importants et très différents. Elles
n'ont pas toutes été acceptées avec le
même empressement par toutes les
Délégations; des concessions ont été
faites sur un point en vue de concessions
obtenues sur un autre. L'ensemble
a été, tout balancé, reconnu
satisfaisant. Une attente légitime serait
trompée, si une Puissance pouvait
faire des réserves à propos d'une règle
à laquelle une autre Puissance attache
une importance particulière.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[Pg 663]</a></span></p>

à leurs autorités et à leurs
forces armées les instructions nécessaires

pour en garantir l'application par leurs

<p>D'après l'engagement qui résulte de
cet article, la Déclaration s'applique
dans les rapports entre les Puissances
Signataires, quand les belligérants sont
également parties à la Déclaration.</p>

<p>Ce sera à chaque Puissance à prendre
les mesures nécessaires pour assurer
l'observation de la Déclaration. Ces
mesures pourront varier suivant les
pays, exiger ou non l'intervention du
pouvoir législatif. C'est une affaire
d'ordre intérieur.</p>

<p>Il faut remarquer que les Puissances
neutres peuvent être aussi dans le cas

<p><i>Les Puissances représentées à la Conférence
Navale de Londres, attachant un
prix particulier à la reconnaissance
générale des règles adoptées par elles,
expriment l'espoir que les Puissances qui

la présente Déclaration. Elles prient le
Gouvernement Britannique de vouloir
bien les inviter à le faire.</i></p>

<p><i>La Puissance qui désire adhérer

<p><i>Ce Gouvernement transmettra immédiatement
à toutes les autres Puissances

la notification. L'adhésion produira
effet soixante jours après cette date.</i></p>

<p><i>La situation des Puissances adhérentes
sera, en tout ce qui concerne cette
Déclaration, assimilée à la situation des
Puissances Signataires.</i></p>

<p>La Déclaration de Paris contenait
déjà une invitation adressée aux Puissances
non représentées, à l'effet d'adhérer
à la Déclaration. L'invitation officielle,
au lieu d'être faite individuellement
par chacune des Puissances représentées
à la Conférence, sera plus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>
aisément faite par la Grande-Bretagne
agissant au nom de toutes.</p>

<p>Les formes de l'adhésion sont très
simples. L'assimilation des Puissances
adhérentes aux Puissances Signataires
entraîne naturellement pour les premières
l'observation de l'article 65;
on ne peut adhérer à une partie de la
Déclaration, mais seulement à l'ensemble.</p>

<p class="center">Article 71.</p>

<p><i>La présente Déclaration, qui portera
la date du 26 février 1909, pourra être
signée à Londres, jusqu'au 30 juin 1909,

<p>Comme à La Haye, on a tenu compte
des convenances de certaines Puissances
dont les Représentants peuvent
ne pas être en situation de signer dès
à présent la Déclaration et qui cependant
veulent être considérées comme des
Puissances Signataires, non comme des
Puissances adhérentes.</p>

<p>Il va sans dire que les <i>Plénipotentiaires
des Puissances</i> dont il est parlé
à l'article 71 ne sont pas nécessairement
ceux qui avaient été délégués
comme tels à la Conférence Navale.</p>

<p><i>En foi de quoi, les Plénipotentiaires
ont revêtu la présente Déclaration de leurs
signatures et y ont apposé leurs cachets.</i></p>

Power of

State or
Chief
Executive
Authority
to detain
Ship.</p></div>

<p>23. If the Secretary of State or the
chief executive authority is satisfied
that there is a reasonable and probable
cause for believing that a ship within
Her Majesty's dominions has been or
is being built, commissioned, or
equipped contrary to this Act, and is
about to be taken beyond the limits of
such dominions, or that a ship is about
to be despatched contrary to this Act,
such Secretary of State or chief executive
authority shall have power to
issue a warrant stating that there is
reasonable and probable cause for believing
as aforesaid, and upon such
warrant the local authority shall have
power to seize and search such ship,
and to detain the same until it has been
either condemned or released by process
of law, or in manner herein-after
mentioned.</p>

<p>The owner of the ship so detained,
or his agent, may apply to the Court of
Admiralty for its release, and the court
shall as soon as possible put the matter
of such seizure and detention in course
of trial between the applicant and the
Crown.</p>

<p>If the applicant establish to the
satisfaction of the court that the ship
was not and is not being built, commissioned,
or equipped or intended to
be despatched contrary to this Act,
the ship shall be released and restored.</p>

<p>If the applicant fail to establish to
the satisfaction of the court that the
ship was not and is not being built,
commissioned, or equipped, or intended
to be despatched contrary to this Act,
then the ship shall be detained till released
by order of the Secretary of
State or chief executive authority.</p>

<p>The court may in cases where no
proceedings are pending for its condemnation
release any ship detained
under this section on the owner giving
security to the satisfaction of the court
that the ship shall not be employed
contrary to this Act, notwithstanding
that the applicant may have failed to
establish to the satisfaction of the
court that the ship was not and is not
being built, commissioned, or intended
to be despatched contrary to this Act.
The Secretary of State or the chief
executive authority may likewise release
any ship detained under this
section on the owner giving security
to the satisfaction of such Secretary of
State or chief executive authority that
the ship shall not be employed contrary
to this Act, or may release the
ship without such security if the Secretary
of State or chief executive authority
think fit so to release the same.</p>

<p>If the court be of opinion that there
was not reasonable and probable cause
for the detention, and if no such cause
appear in the course of the proceedings,
the court shall have power to declare
that the owner is to be indemnified by
the payment of costs and damages in
respect of the detention, the amount
thereof to be assessed by the court,
and any amount so assessed shall be
payable by the Commissioners of the
Treasury out of any moneys legally
applicable for that purpose. The
Court of Admiralty shall also have
power to make a like order for the
indemnity of the owner, on the application
of such owner to the court, in a
summary way, in cases where the ship
is released by the order of the Secretary
of State or the chief executive
authority, before any application is
made by the owner or his agent to the
court for such release.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section contained
shall affect any proceedings instituted
or to be instituted for the condemnation
of any ship detained under this section
where such ship is liable to forfeiture
subject to this provision, that if such
ship is restored in pursuance of this
section all proceedings for such condemnation
shall be stayed; and where
the court declares that the owner is to
be indemnified by the payment of costs
and damages for the detainer, all costs,
charges, and expenses incurred by such
owner in or about any proceedings for
the condemnation of such ship shall
be added to the costs and damages
payable to him in respect of the detention
of the ship.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section contained
shall apply to any foreign non-commissioned
ship despatched from any
part of Her Majesty's dominions after
having come within them under stress
of weather or in the course of a peaceful
voyage, and upon which ship no fitting
out or equipping of a warlike character
has taken place in this country.</p>

<div class="sidenote1"><p>Special Power of Local Authority to detain Ship.</p></div>

<p>24. Where it is represented to any
local authority, as defined by this Act,
and such local authority believes the
representation, that there is a reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
and probable cause for believing
that a ship within Her Majesty's dominions
has been or is being built, commissioned,
or equipped contrary to this
Act, and is about to be taken beyond
the limits of such dominions, or that a
ship is about to be despatched contrary
to this Act, it shall be the duty
of such local authority to detain such
ship, and forthwith to communicate the
fact of such detention to the Secretary
of State or chief executive authority.</p>

<p>Upon the receipt of such communication
the Secretary of State or chief
executive authority may order the
ship to be released if he thinks there is
no cause for detaining her, but if satisfied
that there is reasonable and probable
cause for believing that such ship
was built, commissioned, or equipped
or intended to be despatched in contravention
of this Act, he shall issue his
warrant stating that there is reasonable
and probable cause for believing
as aforesaid, and upon such warrant
being issued further proceedings shall
be had as in cases where the seizure or
detention has taken place on a warrant
issued by the Secretary of State without
any communication from the local
authority.</p>

<p>Where the Secretary of State or
chief executive authority orders the
ship to be released on the receipt of a
communication from the local authority
without issuing his warrant,
the owner of the ship shall be indemnified
by the payment of costs and damages
in respect of the detention upon
application to the Court of Admiralty
in a summary way in like manner as he
is entitled to be indemnified where the
Secretary of State having issued his
warrant under this Act releases the
ship before any application is made by
the owner or his agent to the court for
such release.</p>

in the naval or military service
of any foreign state at war with a

<span class="smaller">1 &amp; 2 GEO. 5, CHAPTER 20</span>
</h3>

<p class="center">An Act to make such amendments in
the Law as are necessary to enable
certain reserved provisions of the
Second Geneva Convention to be
carried into effect.<br />
[<i>18th August 1911.</i>]
</p><br />

<p>Whereas His Majesty has ratified,
with certain reservations, the Convention
for the amelioration of the condition
of the wounded and sick of armies
in the field, drawn up in Geneva in the
year one thousand nine hundred and
six, and it is desirable, in order that
those reservations may be withdrawn,
that such amendments should be made
in the law as are in this Act contained:</p>

<p>Be it therefore enacted by the King's
most Excellent Majesty, by and with
the advice and consent of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons
in this present Parliament assembled,
and by the authority of the same, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote1"><p>Prohibition
of use of
emblem of
red cross on
white
ground, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>1.&mdash;(1) As from the commencement
of this Act it shall not be lawful for
any person to use for the purposes of
his trade or business, or for any other
purpose whatsoever, without the authority
of the Army Council, the heraldic
emblem of the red cross on a
white ground formed by reversing the
Federal colours of Switzerland, or the
words "Red Cross" or "Geneva
Cross," and, if any person acts in contravention
of this provision, he shall
be guilty of an offence against this Act,
and shall be liable on summary conviction
to a fine not exceeding ten
pounds, and to forfeit any goods upon
or in connection with which the emblem
or words were used.</p>

<p>(2) Where a company or society is
guilty of any such contravention, without
prejudice to the liability of the
company or society, every director,
manager, secretary, and other officer
of the company or society who is knowingly
a party to the contravention shall
be guilty of an offence against this Act
and liable to the like penalty.</p>

<p>(3) Nothing in this section shall
affect the right (if any) of the proprietor
of a trade mark registered before the
passing of this Act, and containing any
such emblem or words, to continue to
use such trade mark for a period of
four years from the passing of this Act,
and, if the period of the registration or
of the renewal of registration of any
such trade mark expires during those
four years, the registration thereof may
be renewed until the expiration of those
four years, but without payment of
any fee.</p>

<p>(4) Proceedings under this Act shall
not in England or Ireland be instituted
without the consent of the Attorney-General.</p>

<p>(5) This Act shall extend to His
Majesty's possessions outside the United
Kingdom, subject to such necessary
adaptations as may be made by
Order in Council.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
