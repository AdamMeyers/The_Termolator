<P>
A: (Imperial English): The neutral-animate pronoun.  Emperor Chang
disliked the fact that there was no good Standard English pronoun that
referred to a single individual of unknown sex, or where sex was
immaterial, so he made use of the Celtic "a", often written with an
accent mark (á) by those who use Standard, to distinguish it from the
indefinite article (@ is sometimes used when the printing/writing
device cannot show accent marks).  In Imperial English orthography, the
Cyrillic "ya" (reversed R) is used.

ACADEMY: The Imperial Military Academy or Imperial Administrative
Academy.  Both are headquartered in and have their most prestigious

<P>
ALANNA, Dana Dru-:  Originally Dana Manfredi.  A Terran woman who swore
personal fealty to Richard Jason.  When Jason repudiated her after
trying to kill her, Dana asked the Alanna clan-chief's help in making
atonement for allowing him to accept an unworthy thakur-na.  After
seeing the evidence, the Alanna instead asked Clan Miklos to convene a
planet-wide conference, and asked Clan Vader to rule on both Dana's and
Jason's actions.  The decision was that Dana had acted properly and
Jason had not; the Alanna then offered her his clan's countenance
(essentially adoption), and when she accepted, claimed Chief's Right on
her behalf.  The conference agreed with that, banning Jason from any
business in Subsector Sandeman, declaring his property forfeit, and
giving him a day to get off-world or be killed by the first warrior who
saw him.  It also named Dana to the warrior caste and gave her the
right to wear honor-black.  ("Thakur-Na")

<P>
ALTERNATE UNIVERSES:  Until the first ship from a provably alternate
universe appeared in the Empire, these were thought to be mathematical
abstractions.  Afterward, however, they were accepted as fact.  That
first confirmed inter-universe transition, like most, was the result of
a drive malfunction, and led to the further discovery that if the drive
was repairable, the ship's next hyper-transition would take it away
(from what happened to Imperial ships, return it to its own universe).
If the drive could not be repaired, the transferees had to remain.
</P>

<P>
That, at least, was and is the official story.  In actuality,
controlled inter-universe transition exists, but is a
strictly-controlled secret.  There are several reasons for this, but
the primary two are the Ravagers and the fact that, although the time
rate is constant, the apparent time ranges from megayears in the "past"
to megayears in the "future".

ANTI-AGATHIC:  A drug developed in 2113 which greatly extends the
lifespan of humans, both standard and variant.  Begun immediately after
adolescence, it will approximately double expectable lifespan; begun
later, the effect is less dramatic but still appreciable.  Biological

ANTI-INTERROGATION CONDITIONING:  A total memory erasure triggered by a

tape made then, and memory after the conditioning is triggered is
retained; the interval between is lost.

the level of the jurisdiction issuing the arms: green for the Empire,
white for a Sector, yellow for a Subsector, orange for a system, red
for a planet, and black for any lesser jurisdiction.  The baldric may
be fringed in silver or green, depending on the baldric's color.

  General: The entire population is male.  Some are semi-androgynous,
    known as gynandri (singular gynandra), genetically engineered to be
    able to carry children.  These are not numerous (most children are
    gestated in artificial wombs; all are products of cloning or
    laboratory gene-splicing), and they require considerable medical help
    to carry the baby to term once the embryo is implanted.  While the
    genetic engineering that creates the gynandri is contrary to Imperial
    law, the reason was because the Arriani wanted to retain the closest
    approximation they could manage to natural reproduction, so until
    research can provide a way for women to live on Arrian, the
    engineering of gynandri is excepted.  The Arriani, however, do not
    realize this; as far as they are concerned, they have managed to
    keep the gynandri a precious secret of their way of life.

BATTLE-COMPANION: (Sandeman)  One who has fought beside another for
some time, or done a combat-related service for the other deserving
such recognition.  Battle-companions are usually warriors/w'women, but
Others are acknowledged as such occasionally.  Under highly unusual
circumstances, even an enemy may become a battle-companion, at which
point @ is no longer an enemy.  Battle-companions will give each other
Last Gift without question if asked, and when using High War Speech,
employ the familiar mode.
</P>

<P>
BATTLEPREP: (Sandeman)  A combat-oriented form of need, induced by
mental and physical concentration.  Unlike the sexual form of induced
need, which will subside on its own with no more effect than a slight
shortening of the warrior's cycle, battleprep involves the entire body;
unless the warrior goes into demanding combat within an hour or two, he
will go into overload and die.  As this is well known, a warrior will
prep only when combat is imminent.
</P>

<P>
Battleprep is often referred to as a berserker state, but that is only
partially correct.  The prepped warrior is only marginally, if at all,
aware of pain and wounds; blood clots quickly to minimize loss; speed
and strength are heightened on the same order as that of someone of
average strength who can suddenly lift a car to save an infant.  Beyond
this, however, the berserker analogy breaks down, because the warrior
retains his full intelligence and judgement.  This combination makes a
battleprepped warrior one of the most dangerous beings in the known
universe.

BLACK LORD, The:  Sandeman term for Lord Darth Vader, generally
regarded as villain of the classic Star Wars film trilogy.  The
Sandemans see him as a symbol of their race: held in thrall by another
(Palpatine/the Shapers), but maintaining all honor possible during that
thralldom and eventually throwing it off to regain (or gain) full honor
for himself and his family (or the Sandeman race).  Clan Vader, the
first clan formed after Overthrow, was named for him and is the arbiter
for the most delicate questions of honor.  The ceremonial garb called
honor-black is derived directly from the Black Lord's armor and robes.

<P>
BLOODMATE:  A strong, possibly latent empath who has been changed by
the nosferatu pseudo-virus to an extremely capable blood donor, able to
supply all a Kin's needs.  The primary adaptation is bone marrow
hyperactivity, which permits loss of blood with no harm to the
Bloodmate beyond fatigue and increased appetite.  Other changes include
increased physical strength, though not to the extent of a Kin's, along
with heightened empathy and endurance, both of which exceed a Kin's.
</P>

<P>
Although Bloodmates appeared at the same time as Kins, their lack of
visible change meant that for more than two years they were thought to
be no more than unusually capable Donors.  That changed when Marine
Captain Jase Thompson, who was extremely susceptible to the virus, was
changed and it was discovered that he literally had to donate at daily
intervals to remain physically and emotionally healthy.  ["Teams"]
This allowed testing of the other unusually capable donors, and led to
the discovery that the approximate 10% who went through change with no
apparent effect had actually become Bloodmates.
</P>

<P>
BOND:  A close physical/emotional tie between a Kin and a Bloodmate.
It is involuntary, very fast, and takes place when a Kin feeds on a
Bloodmate who is @'s complement.  The empathic link between them is so
strong that each is always aware of the other's physical and emotional
state.  This is usually quite pleasant, but if one is severely hurt or
killed, the other will suffer psychological and physical pain and
illness, sometimes fatal.

Its primary targets, until the Empire's arrival in 2572, were Royal
Enforcement Service troopers; at that point, Imperial personnel took
priority.  Other than those two groups, the Brotherhood's targets are
places which will cause the most distress: schools, hospitals,
churches, and such are attacked at random, the people there killed with
the maximum amount of violence. It is these terror raids which inspired
the formation of the Strike Force section of the RES.

CHANG, Cheong: (2050-2149)  First Sovereign of the Terran Empire.
Retired from the USMC as a Major General in 2097.  Became acquainted
with Reinhard Nannstein, an acquaintanceship that became a close
friendship.  At Nannstein's urging, Chang entered Solar Federation
politics, rapidly earning a reputation for outstanding statesmanship
and unyielding integrity.  Elected President of the Federation in 2124,
he was aware that his friend's work on gravitics (and the high
probability that faster-than-light travel would soon follow) would
require some drastic changes, and he began laying the groundwork for
them.  In 2125, Nannstein invented hyperdrive; as humanity exploded
away from Terra, Chang and Nannstein acted.  Democratic government,
even as loose as the Federation's, had become so obviously
impractical--and Chang was so highly regarded--that they were able to
persuade the Federation Congress to pass a constitutional amendment
dissolving the Federation and establishing the Terran Empire--on the
condition that Chang agree to be Emperor.  One of his first acts on
assuming the Throne was to create the Rangers and nobility; another was
to direct the regularization of English.  His alphabet and some of his
other linguistic changes caught on; some did not.  He died seconds
after midnight, 1 January 2149.

CIRCLE OF LORDS:  The Traiti deities, three females and nine males--one
of whom, Lord Esteban the Peacelord, is a human.  All were planned for
and then influenced, to a greater or lesser degree, by the psionic
computer called Godhome--which had been left behind for that task when
the Others departed to continue their development on another plane of
existence.  Once those who were to become Lords agreed to serve,
Godhome forced them into full intellectual and emotional maturity;
although they have powers generally thought of as godlike, they think
of themselves as parents.  Their aim, over millennia, is to bring all
intelligence to their level; their philosophy is that
self-responsibility is essential to natural maturation, so they
intervene only when, and only as much as, absolutely unavoidable for
racial survival.

CLAN NAMES, TRAITI:  Naming convention is one or two letters, an

Clan names probably had meaning when the clans were originally

CLOUDCATS:  Inhabitants of Ondrian, moved there by the Others about
8000 BCE because their original sun was about to go nova.
</P>

<P>
They resemble Terran mountain lions in size and shape, though because
of their preference for cold climates, their fur is thick and white.
They are highly intelligent, although the first colonists thought them
wild animals; they communicate and manipulate objects with a pair of
tentacular Y-shaped "tongues" that retract into cheek pouches when not
in use.
</P>

<P>
Cloudcats are solitary hunters, living in mountain caves the Others
provided with psionically-operated survival aids; although the closest
world to their native one, Ondrian is enough harsher that, without the
survival aids, cloudcat art and philosophy would have suffered, perhaps
died.  Most are involved with one or the other, many with both, and the
tapestries they weave from their shed fur are in great demand
throughout the Empire.  Although most cloudcats never leave their home
territory, some do take advantage of their right (granted in return for
the colonists' free use of the equatorial zone) to travel at will on
Imperial ships.
</P>

<P>
CLOUD-SILK:  A soft, light, tough luxury fabric made from a plant that

CODES, COLOR:  (Stories)  Generally seen on military uniforms in the

Imperial forces have no collar tabs; Sector-level have white,
Subsector-level have yellow, System-level have orange, and
Planetary-level have red.
</P>

<P>
(TE Society)  These are the ones on the badges, intended to simplify
mutual identification, especially when not in uniform or regalia.  No
color band means no Imperial rank (except for brown, which indicates a
local noble; technically, they have no Imperial standing, but are
generally given the courtesy title of "Excellency").  Green indicates
the Sovereign (wide) and Rangers (2 narrow); white is for Dukes, yellow
for Earls, orange for Counts, and red for Barons (in all of these a
wide band is for a Life Noble, two narrow for a Ruling Noble and @'s
Consort and Heir, one narrow for a Life Noble's spouse and a Ruling
Noble's younger children).  Black indicates Marines, blue Navy, with
wide band for Imperial regulars, two narrows for Imperial reservists,
and one narrow for local forces.
</P>

<P>
CODES, IDENT:  (Stories)  Only S and R indicate status in this group
(Sovereign and Rangers, respectively); with the first and last letters
of the individual's name, these form a three-letter prefix.  All others
have a five-letter prefix, with the first three being a home-planet
identifier (preferably the first three letters in the Imperial English
alphabet, but modified where necessary to prevent duplication), again
with the first and last letters of the individual's name.  The prefix
is followed by an eight-digit number that precisely identifies the
individual.
</P>

<P>
(TE Society)  These were set up to allow computer separation, if it
ever becomes necessary, by Imperial status; the first letter indicates
that with S for Sovereign, R for Ranger, N for Imperial noble, C for
citizens derived (or derivable) from the original TE stories, and E for
citizens of extra-universal origin.  TE is simply for Terran Empire,
and the numbering is consecutive, assigned when enough information is
available to do so--usually when the Admin Service has a persona form
to work from.

COLD PEAK RANGE:  A Sandeman mountain range, mostly on Clan Torrance

pseudo-virus prevents @ from becoming a Bloodmate.  Donating or not is
an individual decision, as is the method.  While most choose to Donate
directly and get the pleasure the Kin feels and projects to @'s Donor
while feeding this way, some people prefer to Donate indirectly,
through a medical unit; that blood is used for Kins who for some reason
or other cannot or choose not to feed normally.  This is not usual,
though; "bottled" blood is, rather like WWII C-rations, life-sustaining

fictional and real Draculas, synthesizing that knowledge with what she
somehow sensed (or knew through Talent) she was becoming, and the
virus' essential benevolence.  Her colony of virus, even though it was
centuries from true consciousness or self-awareness, picked up the
image, possibly as a rudimentary identification, and passed it along as
other colonies reached a level that changed their hosts.

EMPIRE, TERRAN: Founded by Cheong Chang in 2128, the Empire is an
umbrella government with functions limited to defense of the Empire as
a whole, peacekeeping (primarily between Sectors, though occasionally
if necessary between lesser fiefs as well), and inter-cultural
relations that cannot be handled at a lower level.  Its normal method
of operation is that of minimum intervention, to encourage maximum
diversity (within limits; neither anarchy nor Balkanization are seen as
desirable).
</P>

<P>
As a safeguard, although going to the appropriate noble is generally
preferable, all Imperial citizens have the right of direct appeal to
the Throne, and if circumstances warrant (normally determined by an
Evaluation Team investigation), the Empire will act.
</P>

<P>
The Empire is based firmly on the principle of enlightened
self-interest, making it the most thoroughly pragmatic government
humans have ever developed.  Ninety-nine-plus percent of the time, this
means demonstrating an integrity pre-Empire Terran politicians would
believe undesirable to impossible, probably both.
</P>

<P>
However, there is that other fractional percent of a time.  Even the
greatest idealists realize that from time to time, any government is
going to need to use unpleasant, unethical, and possibly even illegal
means to achieve something vital.  For these times, as well as for more

IntelDiv field agents, as well as the rumored Shadow Fleet.

EXOTIC:  Xanaden term for genetically engineered human variants,
specifically those originally intended as sexual objects.
</P>

<P>
Although major genetic engineering of humans was outlawed in 2310, it
has been impossible to completely suppress.  It has, however, been
driven into secrecy, with the result that most such engineering is done
by or for the rich and powerful who have grown bored with legal
diversions.  This in turn means that most subjects of such engineering
have had their sexuality enhanced for their creators' entertainment,
often with other changes being made as well.
</P>

<P>
Most of the Empire's more detailed knowledge of Exotics comes from
those who disliked and were able to escape from those who engineered
them.  Of these, most gravitate to Xanadu and the Amators' Guild, where
they can make profitable use of the engineering carried out on them (or
on their forebears).  It is not known how many either do not rebel or
are unsuccessful in their escape attempts, but it seems reasonable to
assume this number to be far greater than the escapees'.
</P>

<P>
While the details of the various Exotic types vary considerably, the
basics of most are quite consistent, which is to be expected given the
purpose of such engineering.  An Exotic is always responsive, in some
degree, to sexual stimuli, is capable of what seems to non-Exotics like
incredible sexual endurance, and most begin sexual activity during or
immediately after adolescence.  (It must be noted, of course, that any
or all of the above does on occasion occur to a non-engineered human
and cannot be considered proof of engineering; genetic analysis is the
only way to be certain.)
</P>

<P>
In some cases, enhancement of the sexual drive is the only change made.
In most, however, physical changes have been made as well, though not
all are visible (for instance, the Ishtar variants are characterized by
sensory nerves lining the vaginal canal, usually leading to the brain's
pleasure center).  The changes which are visible also vary, from
relatively minor (such as the Tingler's tentacles around his penis) to
near-total alteration (such as the Elf variant's small, slender build
and delicate features emphasized by pointed ears and slanted eyes).

FAMILY (capitalized): The extended family structure recently introduced
in the Kingdom Systems, primarily as a socially-acceptable means of
dealing with the satyr virus and the physiological changes it produces.
As a side effect, it also provides a family structure stable enough
that Special Operations personnel may now marry and are no longer
required to be sterile.  The new Families, the first and best known of
which is Family Cortin, consist of several spouses--ideally, but not
necessarily, half male and half female--with any children.  (As an
example Family Cortin, at this point [2572], consists of Colonel Cortin
herself, who is Family head but not a spouse, two wives, five husbands,
and three children, with a fourth on the way.  It may become more
balanced in the future, since it began as a mostly-male Strike Force
team and has as yet had little opportunity to court more than one
civilian wife.)
</P>

<P>
FEALTY, CONDITIONAL: (Sandeman)  An oath to someone in return for a
consideration, unknown until Gaelan DarShona talked some of the
warriors on the guardian fleet around Mjolnir into taking service in
Planetary Security in exchange for Imperial credits.  Such an oath is
considered void if payment in wilfully withheld (inability to pay is
negotiable) or if the one to whom such an oath is taken attempts to
injure the oath-taker, at which point the one taking the oath may feel
free to take appropriate action against the false acceptor.
</P>

<P>
FEALTY, PERSONAL: (Sandeman)  An oath of absolute personal loyalty and
obedience.  Theoretically, anyone may swear such fealty to anyone, but
in practice it is almost exclusively warriors swearing to Warleaders or
other high-status warriors.
</P>

<P>
It is an honor either to be offered such fealty or to have it accepted.
The one giving fealty (thakur-na) becomes, to the best of his ability,
an extension of the one accepting it (thakur).  The only acceptable
reasons for disobeying a thakur's will are to preserve his honor or his
life, with the thakur's honor taking precedence.  This relationship is
most obvious to non-Sandemans in the custom that any children a 'na
fathers are considered the thakur's, and their use of the familiar mode
of High War Speech.
</P>

<P>
The 'na has his right cheek tattooed with a mark of his thakur's
choice.  Although in theory, since a 'na does swear absolute obedience
and perfect fidelity, there is no need to acknowledge even the greatest
of such service, the Sandemans are realists; if a 'na gives greater
service or does a deed more heroic than may be reasonably expected, his
thakur will have the tattoo circled and allow his 'na to use his name
hyphenated with the 'na's own.  If the 'na outlives his thakur, his
tattoo is barred with black to show honorable completion of service; if
it works out the other way, his thakur will see to honorable burial, if
possible at one of their clanhomes.
</P>

<P>
Although those are by far the commonest ways of ending the
relationship, two others are possible.  If the 'na commits a serious
offense, the thakur may dismiss him by telling him something like,
"Leave me; I no longer need you."  The real meaning is "You have
dishonored me"; the 'na is expected to atone by a painful death at
either his own or his clan-chief's hands.  The other, since Dana
DruAlanna's case in 2624, is for the thakur to dismiss without offense,
in which case the 'na's tattoo is barred with black and service is
honorably terminated for both parties.

Fiefs cannot be combined.  If the heir to a fief marries a ruling
noble, @ forfeits all claim to the fief @ was to inherit, and the next
oldest child becomes heir.  If one heir or ruling noble marries
another, the Sovereign decides which forfeits @'s fief (usually the
lower-ranking, if they are of different levels) and who is to succeed
(usually the next oldest child).

FIELD AGENT:  An IntelDiv officer with special training in covert
intelligence gathering.  Although they often work openly, sometimes
even in uniform, they are not identified as field agents and are always
assigned to cases where their special skills (such as reading the
subtleties of body language, some of them with near-telepathic
accuracy) are needed.
</P>

<P>
When working under an assumed identity, a field agent will use whatever
means are available and most effective for getting the information a
needs or otherwise accomplishing @'s mission.  While this is recognized
as necessary under such circumstances, it is not something the Empire
takes pride in or wishes publicized.  It is also unfortunate that at
times former field agents revert to this end-over-means philosophy,
though if they have left the Service, there is seldom any harm done,
and very little the Empire can do unless the person has broken a law as
well.

HERALDRY, IMPERIAL:  Although the idea of coats of arms in an
interstellar society with numerous other means of identification seems
redundant to some, that purpose became a minor one long before the
Empire.  Arms are a tradition Emperor Chang thought would serve a
unifying purpose, provide continuity, and give an incentive for service
beyond the expectable but not sufficient to earn a Life Nobility.
</P>

<P>
While derived from traditional heraldry and having much in common with
it, Imperial heraldry has the advantage of hindsight, which has led to
several improvements.  The primary one is in descriptions, where
English replaces Old French, making them understandable to those who
are not specialists in the field.  Some traditional terminology has
been retained, either because it is generally understandable or because
there is no reasonably concise English equivalent.  Most terms,
however, translated without difficulty; the slightly longer
descriptions are acceptable because of the greatly increased clarity.
The only exception to this is in the actual Grant of Arms itself, where
the traditional blazoning is still used (though an English translation
is provided on a separate sheet).
</P>

<P>
The heraldic colors remain predominantly the bright primary ones:
silver (now platinum) or white, and gold or yellow, called metals;
black, blue, green, and red, called colors.  Less-used colors are
orange, purple, brown, and "flesh tone".  Taken together, colors and
metals are referred to as tinctures.  Anything described as "proper" is
shown in its normal coloring.  Only two of the numerous traditional
heraldic "furs" are in Imperial use, ermine (white with black spots)
and counter-ermine (black with white spots).  As a rule, metal should
not be placed on metal or color on color, although exceptions--mostly
in the case of charges described as "proper"--do occur.
</P>

<P>
As in traditional heraldry, the field is described first, by color and
any divisions, with the color on the bearer's right or at the shield's
top mentioned first.  Left and right, in all cases, refer to the point
of view of the person supposedly carrying the shield.

Charges may be (and usually are) placed on the field, and cover any
divisions.  The major geometric charges (ordinaries) are mentioned
first, if any appear.  They generally take up approximately a third of

they have other charges upon them.  Note that the vertical and

<P>
Diminutives (except for the quarter) are one-half normal width,
prefixed "demi-", or one-quarter normal width, prefixed "quadri-" and
usually borne paired.  The quarter's only diminutive is the canton,
taking up an eighth of the shield.  If these charges do not extend to
the shield edges, they are described as "clipped".
</P>

<P>
Minor geometric charges (subordinaries) are those which (except for the
border) do not reach the edge of the shield; if used with an ordinary,
the subordinary is placed on top.  The names of these generally remain
the same as in traditional heraldry, as most have no reasonable English
equivalent.  These are the inescutcheon, orle, lozenge, fusil, and
border (formerly bordure).  Two new ones are the hex and pentagon,
while the circle (once called a roundel, bezant, plate, torteau, hurt,
etc., depending on its color) is simply called a circle with the
correct color named.
</P>

<P>
The same principle applies to other charges, such as animals and
people.  "Affronte" becomes "looking outward", "regardant" becomes
"looking backward", and "rampant", which is easily understandable,
remains the same.  Charges are not restricted to the medieval ones,
though many of those are used.  Modern charges include things like
planets, computers, stylized atoms, and spacecraft--although some of
those, particularly military models, can be confused with simple
circles.
</P>

<P>
Ruling nobles' arms, and those of most lower jurisdictions, do not
indicate rank or anything other than perhaps the bearer's reason for
being awarded them; Rangers', Life Nobles', and knights' arms, however,
clearly indicate their rank.  Rangers' arms, since 2243, have been ones
used by previous Rangers; they are distinguished by a green canton with
a platinum Ranger's star.  Life Nobles' arms are bordered in the metal
or color of the noble's level (platinum for dukes, gold for earls,
orange for counts, red for barons) and have a black canton with the
Imperial Arms.  Knights' arms are distinguished by a platinum and green
border, one tincture inside the other.  If the field is a color, the
platinum is inside; if a metal, the green.
</P>

<P>
Use of Imperial arms is restricted, for ruling nobles, to the noble,
@'s spouse, and @'s heir.  This eliminates the need for an elaborate
system of cadency, though to prevent confusion, the spouse's and heir's
arms are differenced.  The differences are a label with two points for
the spouse, a label with three points for the heir.  Should the ruler
retire, both @ and @'s spouse add a true-lover's knot (as the spouse
also does if @ survives the ruler) to indicate dower status.
</P>

<P>
For Life Nobles and knights, only the person originally granted the
arms bears them undifferenced.  A's spouse adds a label with three
points; the oldest child does the same, with @'s label having a star on
each point, and the arms are passed down to each oldest child in this
form.
</P>

<P>
Marshalling (combining two or more coats of arms to create a new one)
exists, but is limited to marriage between two people entitled to arms,
and only for the length of that marriage.  If both spouses are the same
rank, the arms are impaled, with the original bearer's arms on the
right.  If one spouse dies, the other may, but need not, ask the Chief
Herald for permission to continue using the marshalled arms.  The
original coats go to the eldest child of each sex.  If the spouses are
of different ranks, the impalement has the senior's arms on the right,
and the eldest child assumes those arms while the next eldest assumes
those of the lower-ranking parent.

<P>
HERALDRY, SANDEMAN:  Since Annexation, Subsector arms are granted by
Ruling Earl Klaes, and described in English like Imperial arms.
However, as is standard whenever possible with any already-established
custom, the Earl follows the Shaper-established system of granting
arms, in three forms, to clans rather than to individuals.  The warrior
caste bears them color-on-metal, with the clan-chief (always a warrior)
adding a chief of the main color.   The non-warrior caste (Others) bear
the arms metal-on-color.  To take the Clan Leras arms as an example:

retain the full tails and all the coloration of their forbears, they
have beards and, from approximately three months old, a spiral bone

IRSCHCHANS: Felinoids averaging 158 cm in height, 50-52 kilos in

sexes apart--especially since their enthusiastic adoption of kilts
within days after MacLeod's arrival.  They were scarcely less
enthusiastic about joining the Empire, and except for an abortive
rebellion, have been good citizens.
</P>

<P>
The rebellion was motivated by the fact that Irschchans have and use
Talent, which in humans at the time was untrained at best and thought
to be imaginary at worst.  The Irschchans have recognized and used it
for approximately 5,600 years, with the best becoming members of what
they considered a natural ruling elite, the White Order.  That Talent
seemed to make them equally-natural rulers of the Empire, and in 2569
the White Order, led by its High Adept (who was also the Planetary
Baron) rebelled.  The rebellion was stopped thanks primarily to one of
High Adept Thark's students, Corina Losinj, who was persuaded to become
the first non-human Ranger in the process--thus removing the reason for
the rebellion.

KINDRED OF THE DRAGON:  Kins and Bloodmates, those susceptible to and
changed by the nosferatu pseudo-virus.  They are classed as
human-variant, due to the extent of changes made by the virus.  They
are Narvon System's local nobility, and since 2280 all Imperial ruling
nobles in the system are required to be Kindred.  Susceptibility tends
to run in families, though that is not always the case.  Slightly over
half the children who become Kindred have at least one Kindred parent.
</P>

<P>
Contrary to popular belief when the Kins appeared, the Kindred are
neither predatory nor violent; their empathy prevents both, in many
cases to the point where some Kindred have difficulty defending
themselves.  Because of this, they welcome the Imperial military, and
many areas of all three Narvonese planets have Sandeman police forces.
Violent sports are frowned on, considered in bad taste if not actually
obscene.
</P>

<P>
Despite (or perhaps because of) this pacifism, most Kindred who feel
capable of it spend some time in the Imperial military.  Of these, most
serve in the Navy's Chaplain or Medical Corps, though some are
engineers or technicians.  On rare occasion one will join the Marines;
so far all of these have gone to IntelDiv.

KINGDOM SYSTEMS:  Twelve planets in nine systems.  The first, St.
Thomas, was settled in 2158.  The Systems' founders were Catholics who
disagreed with the Roman Church on a number of matters and either
separated themselves or were excommunicated, depending on point of
view, when they persisted in acting on their beliefs.  They appealed to
the Empire, which refused to intervene in a religious dispute.  The
dissidents then fled, claiming persecution, in three small,
barely-spaceworthy craft.  When contact was lost and the Rescue Service
was unable to find them, they were listed as missing and presumed dead.
</P>

<P>
Instead, they had gone well beyond what would be Imperial space for the
next several centuries.  Limited resources and numerous plagues made
their growth slow, but it was steady, and by the time St. Michael was
settled in 2180, the monarchial system was well established, the Royal
Enforcement Service was in place and operating, and the Church had its
own Pope.

KINS:  The majority (90%) of those susceptible to and changed by the

laboratory accident.  Kins develop great physical strength and
projective empathy, as well as the elongated canines that are the
visible evidence of their change.  This change also restricts their
diet to blood, preferably fresh from a human donor.  As a rule, they
have no difficulty finding donors; their projective empathy allows them
to share their feeding-pleasure with the donor.  Attempts by Kins to

LADY OF LOVE:  The Arriani deity, depicted as an attractive human
female but of no other set appearance.  Although not specifically a sex

off-planet and able, with a woman).

LANDER:  The smallest of the Imperial spacegoing craft. It is shaped
rather like a streamlined bus, and is about that size, so small it is

its name), but it is also useful for suborbital flights.  While the

LANGUAGE, Traiti:  A tonal language that gives their Imperial English a
pleasant lilt.  Like German, it combines small words to make larger

Imperial English, though primarily used only in the Traiti Sector, are

</P>

<P>
LANGUAGES, Sandeman:  Pre-Empire English, called Standard, and a
modified version of Classical Russian, called High War Speech.  Since
the Shapers left Terra before Imperial English was widely accepted,
they retained the old alphabet and irregularities (mostly in plurals).
Standard is the Sandeman common speech used by both castes.
</P>

<P>
The purpose of High War Speech, as far as the Shapers were concerned,
was another way to set the warrior caste apart.  By Annexation, it was
less exclusive; most Others had learned at least a little, and as long
as they used formal mode to warriors, no one objected.  (Familiar mode
is restricted to battle-companions, lovers, and one's thakur or 'na.)
There is a technical combat vocabulary, however, that remains mostly
restricted to warriors since they are the only ones with a real use for
it.
</P>

<P>
LAST GIFT: (Sandeman)  The gift of a swift death, asked when a person
(usually a Sandeman) has been too seriously wounded, or is too ill, for
medical aid to do more than prolong death.  Between Sandeman's
overthrow of the Shapers and its annexation by the Empire, their
medicine was primitive enough that this was seen as an unpleasant
necessity to prevent further suffering.  As Imperial medical personnel
have said repeatedly, Sandeman medicine then was little more than first
aid; even something as minor as an abdominal wound was normally fatal.
</P>

<P>
LAWS, IMPERIAL:  The Empire has few laws, but the ones that do exist

LERAS, Nevan Dar-:  SNDNS-6894-7693 (7 Jul 2547-24 Jun 2855)  Graduated
ITMA 2569, first in class; commissioned into SecuDiv and assigned to
IBC Emperor Chang.  Awarded Sovereign's Medal, merit promotion to 1Lt,
and choice of assignment for his actions in the Palace assault that
ended the White Order rebellion.  Graduated IntelDiv Field Agent
School, 2570, again first in class, for which he was given a merit
promotion to Captain.  He was then assigned to investigate the Melgarie
pirate fleet, but went beyond a simple investigation; in 2572 he was
able, with the unwilling aid of Melgarie's lover Neyse Greenfield, to
arrange the fleet's destruction.  For this he received a second
Sovereign's Medal and promotion to Major.
</P>

<P>
In 2574, he swore personal fealty to Ranger Corina Losinj.  On an
assignment for her in 2578 (checking the security protecting IntelDiv
field agents while attempting to deliver the personal weapons his
father Kelly had bequeathed to one who had saved his life), he met and
rapidly became close friends with his "target", Kiyoshi Owajima.
</P>

<P>
When Empress Losinj died in 2624, Nevan technically reverted to his
status as an IntelDiv Major, though one with a grace-and-favor
apartment in the Imperial Palace and a lifetime income independent of
Corps salary.  However, the new Sovereign, Jasmine Wang, asked him to
continue his special services to the Sovereign without the oath of
fealty.  Since he was positive his thakur would have wished that, even
though she had not asked it of him, he agreed; as a result, until his
death in 2855, the various Sovereigns had a personal special agent who,
until his fealty oath, had been the best field agent in IntelDiv.

in the Saga, it is a large hilt containing the powerpack and other

beam "blade".  It first came to Imperial attention in 2542, when Leigh
DarVader bequeathed his to Ranger James Medart as a death-gift.  At
that time the powerpack would support less than five minutes' blade
activation, making the saber impressive but of little or no practical
use.  Within two years, however, Imperial scientists were able to
develop a powerpack that lasted over half an hour, making the saber a
practical hand-to-hand combat weapon.  With distance weapons far more
popular with most Imperial citizens, however, they are still seldom
seen outside Subsector Sandeman.
</P>

<P>
The Vader clan's development of controlled-length laser beams, though
made specifically for the saber, has proven to be a significant one in
other fields as well, leading to numerous improvements in technologies
from medicine to heavy equipment manufacture.  It has also, since
Ranger Medart assisted them in obtaining an Imperial patent on the

when she reported the White Order's impending rebellion.  In the course
of stopping that rebellion, she and Medart experienced pattern rapport,
which revealed that he possessed a strong Talent, including a healing
aspect she had not previously encountered.  She helped him train it as
much as possible during the trip to Terra, completing it after the
rebellion was over.  Testing then showed the Sovereign and other
Rangers also had strong Talent, and Losinj trained them as well.  That
degree of Talent, regardless of its specific aspect, was immediately
added to Ranger qualifications.

She accepted Nevan DarLeras as thakur-na in 2574, was elected Successor

MARINE CORPS, IMPERIAL TERRAN:  The senior Imperial service, the ITMC
was founded by Emperor Chang on 10 November 2128, though he established
the Empire itself and took the Throne on 22 January.  The date was
deliberately chosen to coincide with the birthday, 353 years earlier,
of the United States Marine Corps; the Navy and the Administrative
Service were founded one week later, replacing Solar Federation
services which were then disbanded.
</P>

<P>
Emperor Chang had retired from the USMC at the rank of Major General
after twenty-five years' service, and thought it only fitting that the
ITMC--a great majority of whose first officers and NCOs came from the
USMC--continue the history and traditions he thought invaluable.  He
also instituted a new tradition at that time: at 1000 hours, Palace
Standard Time, on 10 November of every year, the Sovereign @self
publishes the Birthday Article to every Marine post and shipboard
detachment.  While there have been many changes, the ITMC retains
things like the dress blue uniform and Marine Emblem which make its
lineal descent from the USMC obvious.  The dress blue uniform (with the
USMC male version used by both sexes) is essentially unchanged; the
ITMC Emblem substitutes the Imperial stylized globe for the USMC's
Terran Western hemisphere.  (For non-humans, there are uniform
variations based on physical structure; Traiti, for instance, do not
wear headgear except for protection, and the Irschchans, since 2569,
wear a kilt version of any Imperial uniform.)

Imperial ships, 2532.  Called Mjolnir Conference, 2542, which resulted
in the end of the Sandeman War and the creation of Subsector 5-D,
Sandeman.  Recruited Ranger Corina Losinj, then helped her stop White
Order revolt, 2569; en route from Irschcha to Terra on this mission,
the two discovered and began to train his latent Talent.  To Ranger
Losinj's surprise, this included healing, an aspect that had not

Had Medart not been selected as a Ranger, he planned to specialize in

<P>
NEED, Sandeman Warriors':  The primary physiological change that
differentiates warriors from non-warriors.  It is controlled by a
ductlesss gland which secretes the hormone egerin, beginning at
puberty; this begins the need cycle, and increases the warrior's
endurance and healing speed beyond even the Sandeman norm.
</P>

<P>
There are three forms of need: cyclical, induced, and battleprep.
Cyclical is involuntary, caused by the normal buildup of egerin, since
that hormone cannot be metabolized alone.  A warrior's cycle length is
individual, and can vary from five to eight days.  If the egerin
buildup is not interrupted by combat or sex (both of which stimulate
adrenalin production to levels that allow interaction with egerin and
permit it to be metabolized), about two-thirds of the way through a
warrior's cycle he begins to experience heightened sensitivity, both
physical and mental.  This is the pre-need stage.  Need itself begins
as further-increased sensitivity that could be described as
irritability, at which point patience and self-control are not among
the warrior's strong points.  This stage, as a rule, lasts for about a
day; it is not dependent on the cycle length, and is what is called
active need.  If it is not satisfied, the warrior starts going into
overload; all body systems become hyperactive, and the effect is one of
multiple stress diseases.  Untreated overload lasts about two days.
</P>

<P>
The other two forms can be undertaken voluntarily at any stage short of
overload.  Induced need is the sexual form, stimulated by arousal and
manipulation of the need gland.  It results in heightened sexual
ability and greatly increased fertility; if the warrior's partner is in
her fertile period; conception is almost a certainty.  If induced need
is not resolved, it will abate on its own since it involves only the
reproductive organs, speeding the warrior's cycle slightly--though the
egerin fluctuations are quite uncomfortable to the warrior.  Its
resolution results in aftersleep, a near-comatose state that lasts for
several hours.
</P>

<P>
Battleprep is the combat-oriented form of need, induced by mental and
physical concentration.  Unlike induced need, battle-prep involves the
entire body; unless the warrior goes into demanding combat within an
hour or two, he will go into overload and die.  As this is well known,
a warrior will prep only when combat is imminent.
</P>

<P>
Battleprep is often referred to as a berserker state, but that is only
partially correct.  The prepped warrior is only marginally, if at all,
aware of pain and wounds; blood clots quickly to minimize loss; speed
and strength are heightened on the same order as that of someone of
average strength who can suddenly lift a car to save an infant.  Beyond
this, however, the berserker analogy breaks down, because the warrior
retains his full intelligence and judgement.  This combination makes a
battleprepped warrior one of the most dangerous beings in the known
universe.
</P>

<P>
At home, or on any Sandeman-controlled world, a warrior is in no danger
of overload unless very unusual circumstances arise.  There are always
warriors and w'women around.  And except in hostile-alien territory,
where need is a weakness that must be concealed, keeping even an enemy
warrior from dying in overload is as ingrained as their politeness.  It
is honorable to kill him, imprison him, even torture him for
information--but if he goes into active need, he gets treatment.  If no
w'woman is available or willing, there is a ritual offering of
non-hostile life-combat by one or more of the imprisoning clan's
warriors.
</P>

<P>
The need cycle can be disrupted by serious injury or illness; the
disruption will last from the time of the injury or illness until the
warrior regains near-normal health.
</P>

<P>
Shaper experiments show that the need cycle can be permanently ended by
removal of the need gland; this turns the warrior into an Other man
with combat skills but none of the other warrior advantages.
Naturally, Sandemans find this idea both repulsive and obscene.
</P>

<P>
NEEDLER:  Sandeman energy handgun.  Although it has less raw power than
a blaster, the beam is much more finely adjusted, so it has equal or
greater effective power.  While the narrower beam requires more careful
aim, Sandemans prefer its greater precision, most considering the
blaster's wider beam unacceptably sloppy.

These may be named by any ruling noble within @'s fief and will have

Inheritance of rule is by strict primogeniture, except in the few fiefs
where, by the Sovereign's dispensation, there is some other

is also possible, though rare, for a noble to ask the Sovereign to
disqualify @'s firstborn for cause, and confirm someone else as Heir.

Should a ruling noble die without an heir, the Heir to the next higher
fief takes over until the Sovereign can select a new ruler.  If the
fief left vacant is a Sector, a Ranger will take the position

NOSFERATU PSEUDO-VIRUS:  An organism resembling a virus more closely
than anything else its first investigators were aware of.  It is
capable of infecting approximately one percent of the inhabitants of
Narvon System and an unknown but much smaller percentage of Terrans;
all others are immune.  While very few Terrans are susceptible, that
small percentage is extremely so, and all so far known have become
Bloodmates.  Susceptibility is determined by high empathy, though it
may be mostly latent until the Change.  Narvonese research has shown
that a person with a certain rare "marker" gene configuration is
susceptible, but until nearly 2600, the reason is not known.  A
susceptible person subjected to severe weakening (due to illness or
trauma) after exposure will undergo physical and mental changes,
becoming a Kin or Bloodmate.

It is the degree of empathy which determines whether the Change is to
Kin or Bloodmate, with the more empathic becoming the Bloodmates.

OMNISM: (for Church of the Omniverse)  The commonest of the "new"

hyperdrive to be a success, and got a major boost the first time an
other-universe ship appeared in Imperial space.  (Dropped there by a
hyperdrive malfunction, the only publicly-known reason for
interuniverse transition.)
</P>

<P>
It is a highly syncretic religion which teaches that there is one
Creator of all the universes that form the Omniverse.  This Creator is
unknowable by finite intelligence, but some of A's attributes can be
deduced from what humans can understand of A's creations.  The main
parts are that all religions are true in part, with the gods being
those aspects of the Creator (some in body) sent to reveal what a given
society needs and can understand about the Creator.  (Everything in all
the universes is part of the Creator, of course, that being what A
created with.)  Sin is either failure to use, or the harmful use of,
the Creator's gifts.  Deliberately causing unnecessary harm/pain is the
greatest sin.

</PRE>

<P>
Cloudcats were moved here circa 8000 BCE because their sun was about to
go nova.  The cloudcats were established in the mountains, where
psionically activated survival aids left by the Others gave them the
comfort and leisure to develop their arts and philosophy.  Humans and
Irschchans founded a joint colony in 2532 to grow miracle-weed; they
believed the cats to be unintelligent predators until a young
Irschchan, lost in the mountains, was rescued and returned to the
colony by a cloudcat whose name translates to Starflower.
</P>

<P>
Rapid-heal was so valuable a medication that Emperor Yasunon sent
Ranger Medart to attempt negotiation with the cloudcats.  They proved
amenable, wanting little more than that the colonists leave them alone
unless they instituted the contact, and the right to travel on Imperial
vessels whenever they chose.  In return, they permitted the colonists
to occupy and farm the entire equatorial zone.

OWAJIMA, Kiyoshi:  Began his career as a Kai-school ninja, a mostly
hereditary group that provides the Nippon-Ni Shogun's secret police.
Like the others, he is honorable and idealistic, though his standards
do not necessarily match most Imperial citizens'; for instance, he
firmly believes the Kai school's teaching that some form of
well-trained, well-disciplined secret police is essential to the smooth
functioning of a society, able to unobtrusively remove disruptive
elements that the open police and courts cannot touch.  During this
period, his cover was that of an artist, and he was much admired for
the disciplined spareness of his work.  When he discovered the
existence of IntelDiv field agents, he decided his skills could be put
to excellent use as one of that group, and after Nevan DarLeras swore
fealty to Corina Losinj, was the top-rated field agent until his own
retirement.

PERIDOPICLES:  Ducal family, Sector 14.  Legend has it that this family
was cursed when the first Duke, Orion, defeated the "witch" Lilith and
destroyed the Blue Crystal from which she gained her powers.  As she
was dying, she pronounced the curse that death would visit Orion's
heirs through their children.  The line is, in fact, subject to a
genetic defect which is fatal to seventy-five percent of the children
and can, in a way that has not yet been determined, be passed on to the
pregnant mother, with a twenty-five percent fatality rate.
</P>

<P>
Historians believe the Blue Crystal was a psionic amplifier, and that
in destroying it, the Duke received a nonfatal dose of some unknown
radiation which caused a genetic mutation passed in the male line;
females who survive are invariably sterile.  Children have an unusually
high body radiation count, certain proof of parentage.  (Linda Gerhart)

POWER ARMOR:  Full-metal armor with force-field shielding, used in
initial assaults and intense firefights.  The force-field is the
armor's primary defense; the armor itself serves mostly as a weapons
platform, though if the force-field fails, it will sometimes provide
enough protection for the operator to reach safety.  In most cases,
however, force-field failure is due to overload by enemy fire, and the
ensuing suit failure and powerpack disruption cause total destruction
of armor and operator both.
</P>

<P>
The armor is so massive that the operator cannot move it without
assistance.  This is provided by internal sensors which amplify small
operator motions and transmit them to fusion-powered servos; these move
the armor itself.  Since delicacy of control is more important than
sheer strength, which the armor provides, most power-armor specialists

RANGERS, IMPERIAL:  Established by Emperor Chang in 2128, this group is

of qualities including (but not limited to) intelligence, common sense,
adaptability, realistic idealism, loyalty to the Empire, no close
personal ties, and--since 2569--Talent.  They are generally chosen
young, trained on the job for two or three years by another Ranger.
They are the Sovereign's personal representatives and troubleshooters,
doing what the Sovereign would if @ could be in ten places at once.
They have the right to wield Imperial power at need, though if time
permits, they will always consult with the Sovereign before doing so.
It is they who choose the Successor, in theory any qualified Imperial

technological and population level near the Empire's--devastate it and
proceed to another.  However, no Empire-level civilization is attacked
more than once, because a civilization at that stage can, and so far
always does, defeat them.  After such a defeat, the Ravagers retreat,
and it is several years before they attack again anywhere.  This is the

Empires or the equivalent in still other alternates.

RELIGION, Sandeman:  Created, like most of Sandeman culture, by the

duties in the sense of most Terrestrial pantheons; they are more of an

</P>

<P>
The RES is divided into the regular forces, who operate much like
police in the Empire, and Special Operations, which are most similar to
the ITMC's Special Forces.  Until recently, because of the dangers of

Special Operations has recently acquired a subdivision called the

  General:  The main differences from Terra are the higher average
    temperature and its concomitant, no real arctic areas.  Sandeman
    has eight continents, six of which have been explored fairly
    thoroughly; the northern one, Erewhon, and about two-thirds of the
    southerly shield-shaped one, Quivira, are too cold for Sandeman
    comfort.  The others are Camelot, Shangri-La, Arcadia, Eden, Canaan,
    and Eldorado.  Under the Shapers, these were divided into districts,
    but since Overthrow Day (7 Oct 2316), subdivision has been by clan
    areas instead; the districts no longer exist.
</PRE>

<P>
Another difference is Sandeman time.  Both day and year are somewhat
shorter than Terra's, but they use the Terran Standard system for
record-keeping, which leads to some interesting anomalies, such as the
last of the twenty-four hours being only forty-seven minutes long.
This means they have approximately 103 hours per Standard year
difference, relative to Terra.  Their year is also linked to Terra's in
a way different from most Imperial worlds', a way permitted by their
minimal axial tilt and accompanying barely-noticeable seasons: while
their physical year is 348 days, their calendar year is 368 1/4.
Because of the shorter day, they add four days (February 29-31 and
September 31; April 31 in leap years) so their calendar year ends up
quite close to the Standard one.

to the number and extent of changes made.  In dealings with Sandemans,
especially the warrior caste, it is essential to keep those changes,
and the fact of a culture designed in large part to enhance them, in
mind.  Sandemans are motivated primarily by honor, are intensely proud
and ethnocentric, and have an extreme privacy drive.  Courtesy is
deeply ingrained and they do not expect non-Sandemans to live up to
Sandeman standards even when visiting Sandeman worlds.  In most cases,
that means they will ignore even deliberate insults from
non-Sandemans--but not in all cases.  Touching one without permission
will get at least a verbal rebuke; attacking one will in all
probability result in the attacker's death.  In Subsector Sandeman, the
offender is at fault; elsewhere in the Empire, that is less automatic
but still the presumption.  To paraphrase then-Baron Klaes of Mjolnir,
the first Imperial world to have Sandemans as guests and protectors
instead of conquerors: These people are used to protecting themselves,
rather than relying on police.  Their reflexes are exceptionally fast
and strong, particularly if they are under attack; anyone assaulting a
Sandeman may expect to have @'s cause of death listed as suicide.
</P>

<P>
Sandemans are short and slender, the men averaging 160-165 cm and 62-67
kilos, the women 2-3 cm and kilos less.  Skin tones range from dark tan
to dark olive, hair from almost white to not quite light brown, mostly
straight though a few have wavy hair, even fewer curly.  Eyes are
pale-to-medium blue, green, or hazel.  Children are born covered in fur
resembling a kitten's; it is usually gone by three months of age.
</P>

<P>
Despite their small stature, Sandemans are stronger and faster than
their creators, with greater endurance and higher average intelligence.
Between twenty and fifty percent (up from about ten percent under the
Shapers) of the males, depending on the clan, are further modified
warriors, whose speed, strength and endurance are increased still
further.  (See also Warriors, Sandeman, and Need, Sandeman Warriors'.)
</P>

<P>
The basic Sandeman social structure is a two-caste clan, with the upper
warrior caste composed of the warriors and warriors'-women, the Other
caste being everyone else.  Caste may be determined by the clan-prefix
(warriors are Dar, w'women Dru, Others Den) and often by clothing; the
warrior caste usually wears subdued coveralls, the Others brighter
clothing.
</P>

<P>
As a rule, Others marry; warriors and w'women do not, fostering their
children with Other families to provide a stable home life.  Children
mingle freely regardless of caste, until at puberty the young student
warriors and w'women move into their rooms in the main clanhome, while
Other children remain with their parents until they marry or establish
their own homes.  Warriors and w'women maintain ties, often close ones,
with the families who raised them and will, in many cases, raise their
children.
</P>

<P>
Most traditional Sandeman names are Gaelic, Gaelic-flavored, or
Norse-Germanic.  There is no naming distinction between the castes
other than the clan-prefixes, or between the sexes except that names
ending in -a are female; anything else can be either.  Nicknames may be
proper names shortened to first or last syllable, or an occasional
positive-attributive descriptive nickname.  Full first names are always
proper usage, with 'the warrior' or 'the lady' added when speaking
about a warrior or w'woman, and 'warrior' or 'lady' may be used instead
of one's name when addressing @.

SATYR PLAGUE: (Kingdom Systems)  A mutant plague strain that appeared
on St.  Thomas in 2542.  Its "victims" (few of whom consider themselves
as such) develop an increased sexual drive and capacity, as well as
other minor enhancements.  Once its effects became known, it spread
rapidly throughout the Systems, and has caused a number of societal
changes, including the Families.  It is not contagious in normal
contact; the risk (or chance) of contagion otherwise depends on
intimacy of contact.

SCANLON, David Mark:  (2541-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) Captured during the Nemran Rebellion
(2555) shortly after his fourteenth birthday, he was helped to escape

Ranger Esteban Tarlac was taken prisoner.  He then rescued the Ranger,
who had been seriously injured, from the rebel camp, nursing and
guarding him until Imperial Marines landed with medical help.  For his
actions, he was created a Life Duke.

STINGWEED:  Nemran plant.  A low-growing shrub with silvery-green
three-lobed leaves and milky sap.  The sap contains something generally
described as a cross between a fungus and a bacterium, which is
harmless to intact skin, but is poisonous if introduced into a wound.
The first indication of poisoning, usually in less than an hour, is
that the wound begins to ooze a thick, greenish-yellow, foul-smelling
matter.  If the victim does not receive prompt treatment, a fever
develops, followed by delirium, coma, and death, the speed of progress
determined by the amount of poison absorbed.  It is dangerous for
anyone except a medic or physician with life support available to
attempt medicating a stingweed victim, since even something as normally

the Sovereign died to elect a new one, thus risking a period without a
ruler, the Conclave would elect a Successor as soon as the new
Sovereign ascended the Throne.  Acting on that, a Conclave to elect his
Successor was held a month later; that was Ranger Susan Lindner, who
followed his example, as has been done ever since.  See below for a

and (so far only in humans) healing. There may be other aspects also,
as yet undefined.  On Irschcha, it has been searched for and trained by

Ranger James Medart, in 2569.

Talent is uncommon among humans, only about half of one percent having
mind shields, though perhaps twice as many have the weaker screens.
Among Sandemans, Talent of shield level is fifty percent, ninety-five

Talent training, seeing it as a violation of privacy, so there is no

TARLAC, Esteban:  (2533-2568)  Imperial Ranger, 2553-2568.  His first

Tarlac's greatest accomplishment, though, was his almost single-handed
ending of the Traiti War.  He agreed to submit to the Traiti Ordeal of
Honor and succeeded, returning to Terra with the Traiti leaders, who
claimed their rightful place (thanks to their Terran origin) as
Imperial citizens.  Tarlac was assassinated during the ceremony, by a
Humanity First fanatic.  The Traiti maintain, however, that he actually
died of his Scarring seconds after completing the Ordeal, and became
the last member of the Circle of Lords, their gods; they revere him as

THARK:  (ISCTK-2395-8016)  High Adept of the White Order, 2540-2569.
Corina Losinj's teacher until she discovered his planned revolt against
the Empire.  His intent was to replace the unTalented (and therefore
unqualified, in his opinion) human rulers with the White Order.  When
he discovered that Losinj had become a Ranger, and was forced to
realize that some humans did indeed have Talent, his reason for revolt
was eliminated.  The same honor that had motivated him to start the
revolt then required that he halt it, surrender leadership of the White
Order, and accept punishment.  As part of that punishment, he destroyed
his soul-blade, which sent him into a permanent state of psychic shock.
Since he had ended the rebellion himself and imposed a part of the
punishment on himself, he was not executed; instead, he was placed in
the custody and care of Clan Ch'kara of the new Traiti Sector.

THOMPSON, Jase:  The first Bloodmate to be recognized as such, in 2277.
He was in command of the Evaluation Team sent in response to Archbishop
Klein's complaint about Narvonese turning into blood-drinking monsters.
When blood tests taken on landing showed him to be extremely
susceptible to the nosferatu pseudo-virus, Count Nilssun decided he
would be an ideal Imperial Liaison for the System if he became a Kin.
When he rejected the idea, she arranged for him to become infected,
then be weakened enough for the Change.  To her disappointment, he did
not appear to Change--but that night, it became obvious that he
literally had to feed a Kin at daily intervals; in so feeding Narvon
System's Chief of Detectives, Enna Kaufman, he Bonded to her.  When he
was questioned by Count Nilssun, he mentioned a dream of the Dragon
Prince, which led to the further discovery that a number of others who
had not appeared to Change had also had such a dream, and were also
able, but did not have, to supply a Kin's daily needs. ("Teams")

TORRANCE, Clan: (Sandeman) Clanhome is located on Quivira Continent.
Although its specialties are boating and seamanship, like most clans it
raises most of its own food; because of Quivira's topography and
relatively cold climate, it has more land than the average clan.  That
land includes most of the Cold Peak mountain range, which is popular
with tourists who can get the clan's permission to visit; the clan
hunts there, as well as harvesting ice-berries, most of which are
exported as a luxury item.
</P>

<P>
TORVA BUSH:  (Traiti)  Actually a low-growing tree.  Its tough inner
bark can be used as a substitute for rope or twine.

<P>
TRAITI: A cousin-race to humanity, having evolved on Terra from a
common ancestor, and removed by the Others about 35,000 BCE to insure
racial survival.  Although traces have been found on Terra, they were
not recognized as such until after contact was made; before that, such
finds were denounced as mistakes at best, frauds at worst.
</P>

<P>
Traiti males average about two meters in height and 250 kilos in mass,
with females somewhat smaller.  They are heavily built but not fat, due
to greater tissue density.  Their bodies are human-looking, as are the
hands (with the exception of semi-retractile claws instead of nails),
although their skin is medium gray in color and as tough as leather
armor despite its softness.  Heads are their least human-looking
feature, being ovoid and having the long axis approximately parallel to
the ground, with bulges along the top and sides.  The eyes are small;
the nose is barely noticeable except for slit nostrils, and the lipless
mouth has triangular, serrated teeth.  There are no external ears.
</P>

<P>
Much of Traiti society is influenced by their sexual imbalance and (on
human terms) severely limited fertility.  Only approximately
one-quarter of the Traiti race is female, leading to a custom (almost a
compulsion) requiring that females and younglings be protected.  (Note
that because of this, all Traiti fighters are male.)  Their "family"
structure is by clans ranging from 10,000 members up, with all adult
members of a clan acting as parents to all its younglings.
</P>

<P>
Custom restricts sexual activity to within a given clan, which is not,
thanks to occasional adoptions and a very stable gene pool, genetically
harmful to the race.  The general attitude is that sharing bodies is a
thing of goodness, between any two adult members of the clan.
Heterosex is preferable when available, because of the possibility
(however remote) of offspring, but because of the sexual imbalance, the
great majority of Traiti males are bisexual in orientation.
</P>

<P>
During peacetime, clans are led by the Ka'ruchaya consulting with the
senior fighter, always a Cor'naya; in combat, the senior Cor'naya takes
charge, consulting with the Ka'ruchaya.  Although she is not in any
formal position of authority, both listen to the clan's Speaker for the
Circle of Lords, who is their religious leader.  The race as a whole is
led by the male Supreme and the female First Speaker.

VADER, Clan (Sandeman):  The first clan founded after Overthrow.  Named
for the Saga's Black Lord, it is the arbiter of the most delicate
questions of honor.  It specializes in energy weapons, the development
of one of which, the lightsaber, required controlled-length laser

VERANOL:  Developed by Solar Federation researchers in 2096, Veranol is

accurate testimony until the mindprobe was developed in 2543.  Although
it is still used for that purpose when mindprobes are not available,
its primary use now is in the anti-interrogation conditioning given

WAR DOGS, Sandeman:  One of the two types of livestock modified by the
Shapers, of the wide variety they took with them.  These are Doberman
pinschers modified for size (averaging about 45 kilos), intelligence,
and speech.  Their intellectual ability is about that of a ten-year-old
human.  The speech modification was less successful; while they can be
understood, it takes either concentration or a practiced ear.  Clan
Shona is the primary breeder and trainer of these dogs, and tends to
consider them as members of the clan.
</P>

<P>
WARRIORS, Sandeman:  Males genetically modified even beyond the
Sandeman norm by addition of a gland which produces the hormone egerin.
Under the Shapers, warriors were about ten percent of the male
population.  This changed after Overthrow, when more warriors were seen
as vital to the defense of the race.  After Annexation, when the
benefits of warrior-police were seen on the worlds they had conquered,
other worlds began to hire them and warriors became an economic asset
to their clans.  Up to half of a modern clan's men may be warriors,
with many of them away from the clan in the Marines or on contract as
security forces.
</P>

<P>
Egerin is the primary part of a sex-linked recessive gene complex, and
is responsible for giving them speed, strength, and stamina well above
the Sandeman norm.  Although the psychological segment of the gene
complex is smaller, it is no less important: Sandeman warriors enjoy
fighting.
</P>

<P>
These physical and psychological traits are developed by training which
starts at age five.  The major emphasis, of course, is on combat and
related subjects, such as weapons, martial arts, High War Speech,
military and Sandeman history, and perhaps some spacecraft handling.
Other important subjects are customs and courtesies, need management,
the clan's specialty, and one or more personal interests, usually
including some form of handiwork.  When the young warriors move into
the main clanhome at puberty, they begin doing their own chores
(laundry, cleaning, etc.), including a share in cooking.
</P>

<P>
At approximately 18 years old, there is a graduation ceremony for the
new warriors and w'women, indicating that they now take their place in
the clan as adults.  There is no sharp division other than that an
adult will not fight or have sex (except for the instructors) with a
student; part of the post-graduation party is an adult inviting one of
the new graduates to one or the other.
</P>

<P>
Warriors have the typical Sandeman ethnocentrism, but to an even
greater degree.  The race was created to be better than its creators,
and the warriors are the best of the Sandemans.  Fortunately, they are
also more concerned with honor, propriety, and courtesy, and they are
thoroughly trained in "warrior restraint"; it is dishonorable to fight
Others who regard themselves as non-combatants, however great the
provocation, except in self-defense.  To a Sandeman warrior, the Marine
slogan "Death before dishonor" is a truism--and a probable reason most
warriors spend some time in that service.
</P>

<P>
Their physiology and training, however, make it unlikely that a warrior
will ever become a Ranger or Sovereign; they are temperamentally
unsuited to administering a civilian group larger than a clan.
</P>

<P>
WARRIORS'-WOMEN, Sandeman: (abbreviated w'women)  The female members of
the warrior caste, women trained in combat, medicine, and need
management.  They have no genetic modifications beyond those shared by
all Sandemans, so any girl-child who wants to take the training may do
so, and most warriors' daughters, particularly the eldest, at least
begin training; those who complete it successfully wear a gold-gemmed
ring (e.g., golden topaz) to mark their status.  Since they have no
special genetic alterations, however, any who decide they are not
suited to the life may quit at any time, during or after training.
</P>

<P>
Because of this, there are fewer w'women than warriors, though ideally
their numbers would be equal.  About the best ratio most clans can
expect is one w'woman for two to three warriors.
</P>

<P>
WEN: (Imperial English) Indefinite pronoun used either when sex is
unknown or irrelevant (e.g., crewwen) or referring to a group in which
both sexes are present (e.g., crewwens).
</P>

<P>
WHITE ORDER: (Irschchan)  The organization of Talented Irschchans that
has ruled that planet since approximately 3000 BCE, its most strongly
Talented member becoming the High Adept.  In keeping with the Empire's
policy regarding already-existing governments, this was modified only
in that the High Adept also becomes the Planetary Baron.

At initiation, a member drops @'s family name, using "of the White

and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the
General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and
distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the
PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a
registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks,
unless you receive specific permission. If you do not charge anything
for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may
use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative
works, reports, performances and research. They may be modified and
printed and given away--you may do practically ANYTHING with public
domain eBooks. Redistribution is subject to the trademark license,
especially commercial redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on
the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use
imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the
beginning of this work.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
