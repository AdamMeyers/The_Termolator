LITTLE MITCHELL

THE STORY OF A
MOUNTAIN SQUIRREL

I

LITTLE MITCHELL’S LADY COMES


Baby Mitchell was an August
squirrel. That is, he was born in the
month of August. His pretty gray
mother found a nice hole, high up in
the crotch of a tall chestnut tree, for
her babies’ nest; and I know she
lined it with soft fur plucked from
her own loving little breast,&mdash;for that
is the way the squirrel mothers do.

This chestnut tree grew on the side
of a steep mountain,&mdash;none other than
Mount Mitchell, the highest mountain
peak in all the eastern half of the
United States. It is in North Carolina,
where there are a great many beautiful[14]
mountains, but none of them more
beautiful than Mount Mitchell, with
the great forest trees on its slopes.

One of these forest trees was the
big chestnut where Baby Mitchell was
born. In the warm and lovely summer
he lay safe in his snug nest twenty
feet above the ground.

How many little brothers and sisters
there were, I do not know, for a very
sad thing happened, and all of them
died but Little Mitchell. I must tell
you what this sad thing was that happened
to the little squirrels.

There was a small log-cabin at the
foot of the mountain, and here lived
a father and mother and a very large
family of very small children. There
was no other house near; and the
father had to go a great many miles
through the woods to his work in a
saw-mill that some one had set up in
the mountains.

[15]


     
     Little Mitchell’s First Home
“A squirrel’s nest, in a nice hole, high up in the crotch of a
tall chestnut tree.” (Page 13)


[16]

And the children had to go such a
long way to school, over little rivers
that they crossed on narrow foot-logs;
and through deep shady woods, where
the sun could scarcely send a ray down
through the tops of the tall trees; and
under tangled rhododendron bushes
that were often like little trees they
were so large, and in the summer time
were covered with masses of splendid
white flowers.

Yes, it was a beautiful forest, though
it was very, very wild; but there were
no dangerous animals to hurt the children,
excepting once in a while a long
rattlesnake that wiggled out of the way
as fast as it could if anybody came
along.

The children loved their forest home,
and they could run across the foot-logs
without slipping into the little rivers,
for they had no shoes, and their pretty
bare feet had learned to cling to whatever[17]
they touched, like the feet of the
wild animals, and they, you know,
never tumble down or slip on a log.

When the children had run across
the foot-logs, and danced through the
dark woods, and skipped along under
the rhododendrons far enough, they
came to the schoolhouse.

You would be surprised to see this
schoolhouse, for it was only a little
log-hut with one room; and the seats
were just rough benches, and there
were no desks and no blackboards.

The schoolhouse stood on the bank
of a little river; and all the children
who lived “yon side” the river, as
they say there, had to come to school
over a long and narrow foot-log. But
this log had a railing to hold on by,
and the children did not mind going
over it any more than you mind walking
on the sidewalk. You see, they
had their bare feet to cling with.

[18]

But they did not have to cross the
log to go to the schoolhouse very
often, for it is almost always “vacation”
in the mountains. Sometimes
the children go to school three months
in the year, but very often there is
school for only six weeks at a time.
So they have to make the most of
the good times, when they all meet
together, and play with each other,
and learn to read a little.

It would be fun to tell you about
the little girls who came from ever
so far, barefooted and sunbonneted,
and the little boys who came from
ever so far, barefooted with ragged
caps on their heads, to this queer
school. And it would be fun to tell
of what they did in school, and of
the sport they had at recess, playing
in the river that ran so close to the
schoolhouse door, and in the woods,
all full of wild flowers, where the[19]
rabbits scampered under the trees,
showing nothing but a tuft of white
down which was their tail. But up
in the trees gray squirrels ran about,
with tails all big and bushy, and not
white at all. It would be fun to tell
about these things,&mdash;but there is
little Baby Mitchell waiting for us up
in the top of the chestnut tree, and we
must hurry and take him down.

But first we must go back to the
little log-cabin at the foot of the
mountain, and wait for the lady to
come along; because, you see, the story
all turns on the coming of the lady.

One August day, toward night,
when it began to get very cool at
the foot of the high mountain, the
mother of the little children who lived
in the log-cabin was very much astonished.
The little children were
very much astonished too. The dog
was so astonished that he forgot to[20]
bark; and the very cabbages and
cornstalks that grew in the clearing
in front of the cabin no doubt were
also very much astonished.

Such a thing had never happened
before; for coming along the path out
of the woods were two strangers,&mdash;a
lady from away off, and a mountain
man who was acting as her guide.

The lady, on her part, was very
much astonished too. She wanted to
climb to the top of Mount Mitchell;
and somebody had told somebody who
had told her that the shortest way up
was from a house at the foot, on the
east side of the mountain, and that this
house was a little hotel where strangers
usually went to spend the night before
starting up the high mountain.

So the lady came from away off,
until she got within a few miles of the
foot of the high mountain. Here she
spent the night in a farmhouse, and[21]
next morning took a mountain man
for a guide, who said he knew the
way; and they started to walk to the
little hotel, which she found was no
hotel at all, but only the tiny log-cabin
where the father and mother and their
children lived.

The lady had to walk, because that
was the only way to get there. There
was no road through the forest, only a
narrow path that went waggling along
over rocks and rivers and tangly tree-roots,
and nobody but a mountaineer
could have found it. The lady followed
her guide miles and miles, and
would have felt very tired, only the
air is so refreshing up by the big mountain
that you cannot feel very tired, not
if you walk ever so far.

The lady wore shoes, of course, and
she could not get through the woods
and over the foot-logs as easily as the
little barefooted children. But at last,[22]
just before dark, they crossed one more
stream over a particularly small and
wabbly foot-log, and there they were.

“That is the house,” said the guide,
as they came out into the clearing
where the cabbages and cornstalks
were growing.

“Where?” said the lady.

“There,” said the guide, pointing to
the cabin.

It was then that the lady felt very
much astonished.

Ladies always feel very much astonished
in these mountains, because
nothing ever turns out as they expect.

This lady had expected to find a
little hotel, you remember.

But where is Baby Mitchell all this
time? you are asking.

Oh, he is safe enough yet. Nothing
at all has happened to him, and you
must wait patiently until it is time for
something to happen.

[23]

The lady is very tired, remember,&mdash;or
at least as tired as anybody can be
in that enchanted forest; and she is
hungry, and must have her supper.

When the mother of the little children
saw the lady coming, she was
glad as well as astonished, and ran to
meet her.

“Law me! You must be plumb
tired out,” she said. “Come right along
in, and set down and rest yourself. We
hain’t got much, but what we have got
you’re welcome to.”

That is the way the mountain people
always talk. Their grammar is all
wrong, but their hearts are all right,&mdash;and
a good heart is worth a great deal
more than good grammar; don’t you
think so?

So the lady went in. There was
nothing else to do. She couldn’t possibly
have gone back all that way
through the forest and across the[24]
rivers at night, you know. And
though the log-house was so small
and so crowded, she felt that she was
not in the way, the mother and all the
little children looked so friendly at her.

She was quite a wonderful lady,&mdash;or
at least so thought that family in
the woods; for while the little children
stood looking at her, what do
you think?

There she sat&mdash;with a doll in her
hands!

It was a little doll, but it had real
hair, and when you laid it down it
shut its eyes.

The little children who lived in the
cabin had never seen a doll in their
long lives before,&mdash;never.

But they knew right away what it
was for. So did the lady. She knew
very well it was meant for children to
play with; and presently she laid it
in the arms of one of the little girls.[25]
And the little girl grabbed it tight
in both hands, as if she were afraid
it would run away. Then she laid
it up over her shoulder, with its curly
head in the hollow of her neck, just
as her mother held the baby, and she
patted it softly with a gentle motherly
touch of her chubby little hand, and,
oh, how her eyes did shine!

Then, wonder of wonders!&mdash;there
was another doll in the lady’s hand,
and she put it into the arms of another
little girl; and still another doll
came out of her pocket, or somewhere,
for the third little girl; and the three
dolls were all as much alike as two
peas.

It was all wonderful. The three
little girls would have thought Christmas
had come in the middle of the
summer, if they had known anything
about Christmas, which they did not.
Yet they were very good and pretty[26]
little girls, and they had lovely rivers
to play in, and a great splendid mountain
to look at all their lives.

Of course there were some boys,&mdash;three
of them; and they were about
as much interested in the wonderful
dolls as were their little sisters. That
is, they were until the lady took out
of the bag which the guide carried
a new jack-knife with two shiny
blades; then the boys’ eyes got very
shiny too. None of them had ever
owned a knife. Their father had one,
and when he was at home the boys
used to borrow it to whittle the ends
of sticks into brushes to kindle the
fire with; for there was never a scrap
of paper with which to start a fire.

You can imagine how those three
boys felt when the lady gave each of
them a new knife! You can imagine
how they felt, I say; but they could
not have told you. They really didn’t[27]
know themselves; for they had never
felt that way before.

What are you asking?&mdash;are we
never coming to Little Mitchell?

Yes; but we must have supper first.

What has supper to do with it?

Oh, everything. For now that the
lady is found, the whole story turns
on the supper.

If it hadn’t been for the supper,
the lady would not have found Little
Mitchell, and you would never have
known a thing about him.

You see, the people who lived in
the cabin had nothing to eat but corn-pone,
which is a kind of coarse cornbread
baked in the ashes; for they
had no stove,&mdash;nothing but a big
stone fireplace to do their cooking in.

There was nothing but corn-pone
and fried cabbage there to eat. So
when the lady came, the father took
his gun (he had just got home from[28]
the saw-mill) and went out to get
some meat for supper.

After a little while he came back with
a large gray squirrel; and pretty soon
they all had a nice hot supper of corn-pone,
fried cabbage, and squirrel-pie.

Now squirrel-pie is really no worse
than chicken-pie or veal-pie or mutton-pie;
but it sounds worse. And of
course nobody knew that the squirrel
that went into the pie was a poor little
mother bunny with a nestful of young
babies.

I should like to tell you how the
lady spent the night in the log-cabin,
which had only two rooms for its
eleven occupants, counting the lady
and her guide who were not expected,
and not counting the very littlest
baby and the next biggest baby and
the three-year old baby, who were all
tucked away somewhere&mdash;under one
of the beds, I think&mdash;before supper.

[29]


     
     The Log Schoolhouse
“The schoolhouse stood on the bank of a little river.” (Page 17)


[30]

I say I should like to tell you about
that strange night; only, of course, you
would not listen, with Baby Mitchell
waiting up in his tree to be rescued.

But I must say that many rooms do
not make kinder hearts or better manners
than the lady found in those two
crowded little rooms of the log-house.

The lady was not used to living as
her new friends had to live, and she
could not get used to it in time to go
to sleep that night. So when morning
came she should have felt very tired
after the long walk of the day before
and the sleepless night. But, remember,
she was in an enchanted forest,&mdash;that
is, it seemed to have enchanted
air, for the moment she got out in
the morning and breathed deep of the
pure high air she felt as fresh as she
ever felt in her life.

And the school-teacher did look so
fresh and pretty!

[31]

Who was the school-teacher?

Why, she was just the school-teacher.
She was young and pretty,
and the little children loved her, and
went to school every morning with her
through the deep woods and over the
many rivers.

She lived at their house during
term-time, and she had just come, for
school was to begin the next Monday.
Her own home was in another part of
the mountains.

When the lady asked her how she
liked living out in this wild and lonely
place, and teaching in the wild and
lonely schoolhouse, she smiled until
her pretty white teeth showed, and
said,&mdash;

“Oh, I like it splendid.”

So you see the little children had
good reason to love her.

II

LITTLE MITCHELL IS FOUND, AND
TAKES A STRANGE JOURNEY

When the little gray bunny mother
did not come home, the babies in the
crotch of the old chestnut tree got
very hungry, and I am sure they cried
all night.

No doubt they were cold too, for
they had no little furry mother to curl
herself about them and keep them
warm. Poor babies! I suppose they
cuddled as close together as they could,
and cried and cried, and wondered why
mother did not come home and take
care of them.

At last, when morning came, the
strongest one&mdash;that was our Little
Mitchell, you know&mdash;felt so desperate[33]
that, although he was only two or three
days old and had not got his eyes open
yet, he climbed up to the crotch of the
tree to find out what he could.

All he felt was the cold keen air of
the early morning; and then, being all
confused, I suppose, and not knowing
how high he was from the ground,&mdash;for
his eyes were tight shut, remember,&mdash;he
tried to walk out into space, and
down he fell,&mdash;not to the ground, oh
dear, no! If he had fallen to the
ground he would have been killed, and
this story would never have been told.

When he felt himself falling, he
caught at the tree-trunk with his little
claws, and managed to get hold of a
piece of loosened bark. Here he clung,
terribly frightened, and crying like a
little baby,&mdash;which, indeed, he was.

Perhaps it was a good thing for him
that his eyes were shut, for how frightened
he would have been to look down[34]
and see the earth so far below him!&mdash;such
a cold, unfriendly earth, too, with
nothing on it for a baby squirrel to eat.

I do not know how long he had been
clinging there and crying before the
lady came. For now it is time for his
lady to come along, and when she once
comes Little Mitchell will be in the
story every minute until it ends.

You see, as soon as breakfast was
over and they had all eaten all the
hot corn-pone and fried cabbage they
wanted, the lady was ready to start up
the mountain.

The little children and their mother
and the school-teacher were sorry to
see the lady go, and the father looked
anxious,&mdash;for Mount Mitchell is a very
wild mountain and a very big one, and
he was afraid they would get lost. He
offered to go and show them; but the
guide said no, he knew the way.

So the lady and her guide started on[35]
up the mountain in the cold morning
air, and it became so steep right away
that the lady had to keep stopping to
get her breath.

It was while she was stopping to
breathe that the guide said,&mdash;

“Listen! I hear a boomer, and I
would like to get to see it.”

“Boomer” is their name for the little
red squirrel, of which the mountaineers
are very fond, and which is not nearly
so common there as the big gray squirrel.
The people who live down below
call the mountain people “mountain
boomers,”&mdash;why, I do not know, unless
perhaps they think they live in the
mountains like squirrels.

Well, the guide began to look around
to find the boomer, and the lady looked
around too, and at last they spied a
little squirrel clinging to the bark of
a tall chestnut tree, twenty feet from
the ground, and crying very hard.

[36]

They soon found that it was no
boomer, but a tiny gray squirrel. The
guide threw up small sticks and bits of
bark to make him run; but he did not
stir, even when a bit of bark hit his
tail.

Then said the guide, “I’m going up
to get him.”

So up the tree he went, clinging
with arms and knees, for the tree-trunk
was so big his arms could not
reach half-way around it.

It was a very hard climb, but the
man got there at last, and, catching
the little fellow by the tail, came
sliding down, the little squirrel squeaking
frantically, for it was both frightened
and hurt at being handled in
that rough way. Its own little bunny
mother never picked it up by the tail,
you know.

The man put the little fellow in the
lady’s hand, and, to her surprise, she
saw it was a young gray squirrel with
its eyes not yet open.

[37]


     
     Little Mitchell’s First Meal
“The Lady dipped the end of her finger in the milk and put it in
Little Mitchell’s mouth.” (Page 52)


[38]

And now you know it was Little
Mitchell, who had fallen out of his
nest and was lying there in the lady’s
hand.

Such a funny little fellow as he
was!&mdash;all head and feet, with almost
no body at all, and a queer little stub
of a tail that was hardly as long as his
queer little body.

The lady laughed when she saw
him, and then she felt very sorry for
the helpless little one.

What could she do with him? She
could not lay him down on the cold
mountain and go away and leave him.
And yet he must just as surely die if
she took him, she thought, for she had
nothing with which to feed him.

He nosed around in her hand in
such a comical, helpless way, not crying
now, but whimpering like a very[39]
tired, worn-out little baby,&mdash;which,
you know, is just what he was.

Finally the lady started on with
him in her hand; but he squirmed and
whimpered so, she soon grew tired
of holding him&mdash;and then, what do
you think she did?

She had on a warm flannel waist
with a soft loose belt, and into the
waist she tucked him. In a moment
he had worked his way down under the
belt, where he snuggled up, stopped
crying, and went fast asleep.

You see, he was almost dead from
cold and weariness.

On went the lady, slowly climbing
up the steep mountain; and the
wonder is that Little Mitchell was
not squeezed to death under her belt.
But he slept on.

On through the great chestnut forest
went the lady and her guide,&mdash;on
past the handsome tulip trees, the[40]
great oaks, and all kinds of beautiful
forest trees.

The sun grew hot on the mountain
side, and the air became soft and
hazy,&mdash;a little too soft and hazy for
safety on that wild mountain, where
storms ride swiftly up like witches
from nowhere.

But on and up they went, until they
came out of the forest to a wide sloping
pasture,&mdash;a “bald” they call such
open places on the mountains.

Here they found the ground covered
thick with grass and flowers, and a
herd of cattle grazing. These half-wild
cattle raised their heads as the
lady and her guide came out of the
forest into their pasture, and some of
them shook their long horns and
began to step nearer. But the guide
shouted and waved a big stick at
them, and they went off.

And Baby Mitchell slept on.

[41]

When they were half-way across
the “bald” that sloped gently upward,
the lady turned around and looked
back over the tree-tops.

It was a wonderful view.

Below was the valley where stood
the log-cabin; but she could not see
the cabin, it was so close under the
mountain; and the valley itself looked
like a slit, it was so deep and narrow.

And now you know why the night
came on so soon, and why the morning
sun was so long in shining down
into the cabbage patch. The valley
was so deep and narrow that the sun
could not look into it until it was high
up in the sky.

Across the narrow valley, and right
in front, was a splendid tree-covered
spur of the Blue Ridge mountains;
and off a little to the left was the
queer-looking Table Mountain, stuck
up like a big hat set on the head[42]
of a mountain. Beyond were billows
upon billows of mountains; and beyond
them, far off in the distance, the
lowlands looked blue and level like
the sea.

The lady stood several minutes
looking at the grand and beautiful
view, with Baby Mitchell fast asleep
under her belt. Then she went on,
and at last they got to the top of the
“bald,” and, with a last look back at
the wide world below, the lady followed
her guide on into the black fir forest.

The black fir forest was very black
indeed, and the fir trees towered up
and up and up so high you could not
see their tops, and so thick you could
not see the sky through their branches.
Oh, but it was dark under them!&mdash;it
was like walking under thousands
of Christmas trees before the candles
and presents have been put on; only
these trees were ten times as big as[43]
Christmas trees. They were balsam
firs, the kind you get the sweet-smelling
needles from to put into sofa
pillows; only these were ten times
as big as the balsam firs that grow
in the North. But they smelled just as
sweet as those, and all the forest was
filled with the perfume of them. The
ground was covered ankle deep with
soft green moss that the lady’s feet
sank into as she walked.

And everywhere were the rhododendrons.
It was too late for them to be
in bloom; so they were not as lovely
as they are sometimes. When you
get into the rhododendrons, you cannot
see up into the tree branches, because
the rhododendron branches are tangled
about you and above you with their
stiff green leaves. They make the
woods seem dreadfully black and
gloomy; but when they are in bloom
it is another matter.

[44]

The lady and the guide went on
and on under the twisted rhododendrons,
and Baby Mitchell lay fast
asleep under the lady’s belt.

Then the guide lost the trail.

It was, in fact, a great deal easier
to lose it than to keep it. Indeed,
it could hardly be called a trail at
all, it was so little used, and one
had to know the mountain very well
indeed to get safely to the top.

Such a wild and lovely forest as
they found now, you never were in.
I do not believe such balsam firs grow
anywhere else in the world. Their
dark green tops make the mountains
look black, excepting when the
air is hazy and makes them look
faint and blue in the distance. But
when the air is clear the mountains
look black because of the fir trees
that grow all the way up to their
tops.

[45]

And when anybody asks, you can
tell them that is why the Black Mountains
got their name; and Mount
Mitchell, you know, is one of the
Black Mountains,&mdash;the very highest
one of all.

Well, they lost the trail, the lady
and her guide, and soon they had to
creep on their hands and knees under
the rhododendrons that twisted great
tangly arms about them and tripped
them up with roots that lay like giant
snakes upon the ground. And then
they came to awful precipices, and had
to creep back again. And sometimes
they had to climb over immense fallen
logs, slippery with a deep coat of
green moss.

The lady remembered Baby Mitchell
under her belt, and crept along as
carefully as she could; yet it is a
wonder he wasn’t squeezed to death.
But he was a good tired baby, that[46]
said never a word, but slept on, warm
and snug under the soft belt.

It was hard work for the lady, and
the air began to smell damp, and
sweeter than ever,&mdash;the way it does
before a rain.

And now and then they would get
glimpses through the forest to where
was a deep gorge with a tremendous
tree-clad spur beyond, and down into
this gorge went pouring what looked
like a river of white mist.

The lady was frightened now, for
she knew they were lost on the wild
mountain, and that the white river she
saw was the fog-clouds rolling in.

The fog-clouds sometimes shut down
on the mountains so thick and heavy
that you cannot see your way at all;
and then it is not safe to take so much
as a step.

[47]


     
     Little Mitchell Cries for More
“He had squirmed out of the blanket.” (Page 62)


[48]

But the guide struggled on as fast
as he could, and would not own that
they were lost, though his face was all
drawn with fear of the wild cloud-covered
mountain.

At last they reached a little icy
stream coming down the mountain and
began to climb up its bed, not minding
the cold water that soaked their feet.
Then on they went as fast as they
could struggle through the terrible
forest, and just as they got to a trail
that the guide knew would lead them
to the top the rain began to fall and
a cloud closed swiftly about them.
But they were on the right path now,
so they did not care for the creeping
cloud.

It was still a long, long walk to the
top,&mdash;for one thing that always astonishes
strangers who go to these
mountains is the way distances stretch
out. They tell you it is two miles
to a place, and when you have gone
two miles it is still two miles farther,&mdash;only[49]
sometimes when you have
gone the two miles it is four more
before you get there.

Well, they got to the top at last,
but by that time the rain was pouring
and the clouds had settled down over
everything. It was a terrible storm
they were in, and so icy cold.

But Little Mitchell slept on,&mdash;he
was so very, very tired, you see, and
then the lady had managed somehow
to keep him dry and warm.

You can see the whole world from
the top of Mount Mitchell,&mdash;well, no,
not really the whole world, but you
know what I mean,&mdash;you can see so
much it seems as if it must be the
whole world; and that is why the
lady had wanted to go there. But
for all she could see that day, she
might as well have stayed at home.

It is usually that way on Mount
Mitchell. No matter how clear it is[50]
when you start, there is a watchful
cloud that goes sneaking up after
you, or else comes sneaking down
from its hiding-place back of the sky
as soon as you come, and the first
thing you know it has folded itself
down over the mountain-top and
blotted out everything from sight.

There is a cave on the top of Mount
Mitchell, made by a large overhanging
rock. People generally go up
from the sensible side of the mountain,&mdash;which
is not the side the lady
went up, because she didn’t know
any better, you see.

The people who go up from the
sensible side take blankets and food
on the backs of mules, and stay all
night in the cave. That is good fun.

But the lady had no blankets and
no mule,&mdash;only a very tired guide,
who was so tired because he got
frightened on the mountain thinking[51]
he had lost the way, and a poor little
hungry baby squirrel fast asleep under
her belt.

The lady looked into the cave, and
what do you think she found?

A couch of balsam boughs; but
that doesn’t count.

An old coffee-pot; but that doesn’t
count.

A little can partly full of condensed
milk; and that does count,&mdash;for, you
see, it saved Baby Mitchell’s life.

Somebody had been camping there
sometime, and had left the can of
milk, and it had not turned sour because
it is so cold up there even in
midsummer.

While the guide was trying to make
a fire out of wet sticks, the lady took
Little Mitchell out from under her
belt,&mdash;and a very limp baby he was
by this time, for he was nearly starved
to death, of course.

[52]

She dipped the end of her finger
in the milk and put it in Little
Mitchell’s mouth. Perhaps you think
he wouldn’t eat condensed milk. You
should have seen him! He licked
every bit from the lady’s finger, and
then cried for more.

She fed him all she dared,&mdash;for
when you are almost starved it is
dangerous to eat too much at a time,
you know. When she would give
him no more, he cried very hard,&mdash;he
was such a hungry baby, and the
milk tasted so good. But pretty soon
he quieted down and went fast asleep
again, and was tucked back under
the soft belt.

The guide could not start a fire,&mdash;which
shows he was not a “truly”
guide, for a “truly” guide can make
a fire out of icicles, you know.

So, all wet and shivery, they sat
in the cave and ate some lunch out[53]
of the lady’s bag, which had been
carried by the guide.

They hardly dared to rest at all,
for they had to get to the foot of
the mountain before night; so in a
few minutes they started down.





[54]



III

LITTLE MITCHELL’S FIRST RIDE, AND
HOW HE AND HIS LADY GET HOME


Oh, no, indeed! They didn’t try
to go back the way they came up.
They went down the sensible side
of the mountain. The distance was
more than twice as great, but there
was a plain path all the way.

But first they stopped a minute to
look at the Mitchell monument. I
must tell you about this. It is made
of metal, and is fastened with four
strong wire cables, to keep it from
blowing down,&mdash;for there are terrible
winds on the top of Mount Mitchell.
The monument is placed over the
grave of Dr. Mitchell, for whom the
big mountain is named, because he[55]
loved it so, and went up to the top
of it a great many times, and measured
it to find out how high it is; but one
day the clouds came down, and he
stayed so long that he got lost on
his beautiful mountain, and died there.

So the mountain was named after
Dr. Mitchell; and Baby Mitchell, as
you have guessed long before this,
was named after the mountain, because
the lady found him on the side
of it.

Well, they started down in the rain,
and the path was plain enough, for
mules sometimes came up it as I have
told you. But it was a hard path to
walk in, for the roots of the big trees
that grew so close together had come
up out of the ground, as tree roots
do, and had twisted about everywhere.
Sometimes it was like going
down a flight of break-neck stairs, the
path was so steep, and the twisted[56]
roots made the steps. Besides, there
were deep holes full of water that your
feet kept sinking down into.

But in spite of all this, it was a
beautiful forest. And soon the lady
forgot how cold and tired she had
been, and went along as happy as
could be. You see, the forest was
so lovely, all dripping wet, and the
air was so fine, she had to feel happy.
The dampness made the moss like
king’s velvet, so soft and deep and
green.

And the great fir trees towered high
up toward the sky, and stood so close
together there was scarcely room to
pass between them; and it was all
dim and half dark, because of the
trees overhead, and the cloud over
the trees.

After a while they got out of the
firs into the briar patch; and here
the sun was trying to break through[57]
the clouds. And after the briar patch,
where it was not so steep, they came
into another kind of forest.

They had got below the fir trees,
and now went along under the broad-leaved
oaks, and chestnuts, and lindens,
and many other mountain
trees.

The path got smoother, excepting
where they had to cross the beds of
rocky streams, full and roaring from
the rain. It wound back and forth
on the mountain-side, and was not
so steep, and the lady kept on feeling
very happy, the forest was so lovely.

At last they got down the mountain
and came to a river that was hard to
cross. It went rushing along, and
they had to jump from rock to rock
to get over. But they managed it,
and then went on through more
lovely woods, till they got to Mr.
Dolph Wilson’s house.

[58]

This house had several rooms, and
the Wilsons were used to having
strangers come and stay with them
on their way to or from the mountain.
They had a mule named Belle, that
had been up,&mdash;oh, I don’t know how
many times,&mdash;and she could walk in
the holes between the tree roots on the
steep part, and over the rocky beds of
the streams, without tumbling down.

As soon as the lady got into the
house, she asked for some milk, which
she warmed over the kitchen stove,
not to drink herself,&mdash;oh dear, no,&mdash;but
for the poor little baby squirrel
that was lying all snuggled up asleep
under her belt.

At first he would not drink from the
spoon; it was hard and cold, and he
did not know how to drink in that
way. But presently he happened to
get the edge of it in his mouth, and
tasted the good warm milk. How he
did drink it then! He held the spoon
between his lips, and drank just as
you drink from a tumbler; and I don’t
suppose anything in the world ever
tasted better to any one than that
milk did to Baby Mitchell.

[59]


     
     Little Mitchell in His Lady’s Cap
“All curled up in a little round ball in his lady’s cap.” (Page 73)


[60]

Then the lady took a piece of soft
cloth for a blanket, and wrapped him
up in it, and took him to her bedroom,
where she put him to bed, and left
him while she got warm and dry and
had her supper.

Do you want to know about his
bed?

Well, you see, the mountain people
use feather-beds, and they have two
or three beds in one room. That is
the way they like to live,&mdash;a great
many people together in one room.

But the lady did not like this way,
so she had a room to herself, with two
big beds in it, and there was a thick
feather-bed on each of them. She[61]
punched her fists down into one of
the feather-beds until she had made
quite a deep hole, and in this she
buried Little Mitchell in his blanket.

You see, young squirrels, like other
babies, need to be kept warm.

So Baby Mitchell had a whole
feather-bed to himself that night, and
he slept without a sound until the lady
unrolled him the next morning.

She hardly expected to find him
alive, he was such a tender little thing
to undergo such hardships. Starving,
and sleeping under ladies’ belts, and
being carried in that way up a rough
mountain and then down again, and
fed on condensed milk and cow’s
milk, and put to sleep at last in a
feather-bed, one would think would
be enough to wear out any squirrel so
young it couldn’t open its eyes.

But it didn’t wear out Baby
Mitchell.

[62]

When the lady unrolled him, there
he was, as alive as could be and as
warm as a kitten. She laughed when
she saw him, he was so little and the
bed so big!

As soon as she unrolled him, he
lifted up his head, and then he opened
his mouth and screamed for his breakfast.
He was used to being cared for
earlier in the morning, in his home in
the tree, and he was starving hungry.

The lady hurried to give him some
warm milk, and when he had drunk it
he went fast asleep right away, and she
wrapped him up and put him in the
feather-bed again, and went off.

When she came back he had
squirmed out of the blanket and was
standing up as straight as he could on
his funny little legs, and holding up
his funny head, with his eyes still
tight shut. And he was screaming at
the top of his voice, “Oh, come and[63]
take me! come and take me!” At
least that is what the lady said he
meant, for the minute she put her
hand on him he stopped crying.

So of course she cuddled him up
against her cheek for a minute, and
talked to him, and comforted him, and
then gave him another drink of warm
milk.

You see, she had left him until he
got hungry, and then he had squirmed
out to look for his lady; and when he
could not find her he screamed and
cried. He always did make a great
fuss when he was hungry.

Little Mitchell and his lady were
comfortable enough at the home of
Mr. Dolph Wilson, who, you must
not forget, lives at the foot of the
sensible side of the great Mount
Mitchell; and if you ever decide to
go to the top of that mountain, that
is the very best way to go. Only it[64]
will take you a long time to get to
the Wilsons’ from anywhere,&mdash;almost
as long as it would take to go to the
moon if there were a rapid-transit
trolley up there.

But you will see a very lovely
valley if you do go,&mdash;not to the moon,
to Mr. Adolph Wilson’s, I mean,&mdash;and
a beautiful cold river with a
great many large smooth rocks in
its bottom, and as handsome a forest
as exists this side of the moon, or the
other side either, as far as I know.

Besides, there are the young Wilsons,
who will be glad to see you,
and who will show you over the
mountains round about; and, finally,
Mr. and Mrs. Wilson will take you
up Mount Mitchell on Belle, the mule,
if you want to go that way.

Mr. Dolph Wilson is the son of
“Big Tom,” the most famous bear-hunter
in these parts. It was he[65]
who found the body of Dr. Mitchell
when every one else had given up the
search. He loves to tell the story of
that search, and it would make you
cry, it is so sad,&mdash;for “Big Tom”
loved Dr. Mitchell. But if you want
to hear him tell the story, which is
well worth going a long distance for,
you will need to go soon, for “Big
Tom” is a very old man now, so old
that he cannot have a great many
more years to live.

Well, the lady had to get back
home; so the day after she got to
his house Mr. Dolph Wilson drove
her and the guide and Baby Mitchell,
in his carriage, with the two little,
lazy, long-eared mules, for ten miles.
They stopped at “Big Tom’s” log-cabin
to see him and hear him tell
his story, and then they went on.

Their way was over a rough mountain
road, where they had to ford a[66]
great many stony streams and a
shining river two or three times.

But Baby Mitchell did not care
anything about this, for he was asleep
in the guide’s hand. You see, at that
time of his life he did almost nothing
but sleep and eat, and he never
cried at all excepting when he was
hungry.

The big, kind-hearted guide looked
very funny holding Baby Mitchell so
carefully in one hand, and the little
can of condensed milk in the other,
while the carriage bumped and jerked
over the rough road. For of course
they had to take along the can of
milk for fear they might not be
able to get anything else for Baby
Mitchell’s dinner.

Mr. Dolph Wilson could take them
only ten miles on their way, because
he had to go back home and attend
to some men who had come from ever[67]
so far to go fishing for trout in the
river by his house.

But ten miles was enough, for the
lady could easily walk to her next
stopping-place, which she did, along
a lovely valley with the high mountains
on all sides of her; and she
carried Little Mitchell now, while the
guide took her bag and the can of
milk.

At noon she sat down under a tree
by the roadside. So few people live
along here that it was as quiet and
lonely where the lady stopped to rest
as though it had been in the midst
of the forest.

She unrolled Baby Mitchell and let
him lie and stretch his limbs in the
warm sun, which he did in a very
comical manner,&mdash;for all the world
like a nice, comfortable human baby.
Then she gave him some condensed
milk, and he had no sooner eaten it[68]
than he fell fast asleep again, and she
rolled him up in his blanket and laid
him on a stone while she ate her
lunch.

When she was rested, they went
on until they reached the place where
the lady was to spend the night. The
guide went home, and he wanted very
much to take Baby Mitchell for his
children to play with. But of course
the lady could not allow that. The
little fellow was altogether too young
and tender to be handled by careless
children who might not know how to
avoid hurting him. So she kept him
with her; and again he had good
warm milk for his supper, and was
put to sleep in a whole feather-bed.

The next morning Baby Mitchell
and the lady took another long drive.
This time they had to go in a lumber
wagon, over a road that was, oh, so
rough! Even Baby Mitchell kept
waking up, the wagon jolted so.
They forded deep rivers, and they
went down mountains and up mountains;
but by noon they got back to
the place where the lady started from
when she went ever so far to the foot
of Mount Mitchell.

[69]


     
     Little Mitchell Warming Himself
“He would flatten himself out and warm the under side of his
body before the fire.” (Page 77)


[70]

This place was a log-house, but it
was not like the log-houses of the
mountain people. It was a beautiful
house, and belonged to dear friends
of the lady. They had built it that
they might come deep into the mountains
to live every summer.

There were no feather-beds here,
and there were a number of cats.
But you will want to know more
about them, for they were very remarkable
cats.

The gentleman at this house where
Baby Mitchell’s lady was visiting gave
him a nice little wooden box, with a
great many holes bored in it to let in[71]
the air; and the gentleman’s wife gave
him some soft cotton for a bed. Then
Baby Mitchell’s lady, and the gentleman,
and the gentleman’s wife, all
looked at Baby Mitchell. His lady
had scarcely taken time for that before,
she was so occupied in getting
him safe through.

Such a funny Baby Mitchell! All
head and feet, you know, with the
queerest little fuzzy tail! And those
eyes tight shut! The gentleman said
he never would have any eyes; but
he only said that to tease the lady,
and the gentleman’s wife said, “Oh,
shame!” for she had quite fallen in
love with the ridiculous-looking little
furry baby.

Then the lady took Baby Mitchell
up to her own pretty room and laid
him on the bed, rolled up in his
blanket, while she went to eat her
supper. When she came back with[72]
a cup of warm milk for him, she took
up the little roll of blanket, and what
do you think!

It was empty. No Baby Mitchell
there!

The lady thought of the cats; but
the door was tight shut, and there
were screens in the windows. She
looked on the bed and on the floor,
but saw no Baby Mitchell. Then she
began, as well as she could, to make
the little noise that Baby Mitchell
made when he was hungry; and
presently, if you will believe it, she
heard something answer her. So she
kept calling, and Baby Mitchell kept
answering, until at last she found
him; and where do you think he
was?

He had managed to crawl out of his
blanket, and no doubt he felt very
lonely and tired and hungry, so he
started out to find his lady. He had[73]
scrambled down to the floor, and gone
across the room, and climbed upon a
low couch under the window; and on
the pillow of the couch was lying his
lady’s cap, where she had left it a few
minutes before. And here she found
him, all curled up into a little round
ball on the top of her cap. He must
have smelled it, and gone there.

So the lady said, “It is time now
for you to have a room of your own,
where you cannot get lost.”

Then she took the cotton that her
friend, the gentleman’s wife, had given
her, and put it into the box that her
friend the gentleman had bored full of
holes, and made a soft bed for Baby
Mitchell. Then she gave him a good
supper of warm milk, and put him to
bed in his box, and he went fast
asleep and slept soundly until the
next morning.

After breakfast next day the lady[74]
put Baby Mitchell on the couch while
she fixed his box, and when she went
to take him,&mdash;what do you think?
He had one round black eye wide
open! He didn’t seem to know he
had an open eye, though, and went
nosing about just as he did when he
had no eye at all.

Next day open came the other
round black eye, and then all at once
Baby Mitchell seemed to be able
to see. And if you will believe it,
he was now afraid of his lady! He
probably had not expected to open
his eyes on a lady instead of on a
furry little bunny mother; and so he
was as badly frightened as though he
had never licked condensed milk from
her finger, nor been taken care of by
her through more than half of his
short life.

[75]


     
     Little Mitchell’s First Chestnut
“He took it in his baby hands, and sat up, and looked around,
very wise indeed.” (Page 113)


[76]

No, not quite so badly frightened,
either; for when his lady caught himand covered up his bright eyes, he
smelled her hands and was not afraid,
and very soon he got to know her by
sight.

She used to give him warm milk
out of a spoon three or four times a
day, and every day he took a little
more, and every day he grew a little
larger. After he had eaten he would
climb all over his lady, and sit on her
shoulder or on her knee for a few
minutes; but he would soon get sleepy
and be glad to creep into his warm
nest, when his lady would shut the
box cover down tight over him&mdash;so
that if a cat should happen to get into
the room and find his box, and should
try ever so hard to get him out, she
could not do it.

Sometimes Baby Mitchell would
climb up on the wire screen that
stood before the fireplace; and in the
early morning, when the air was cool[77]
and there was a fire blazing in the
fireplace, he used to like to flatten
out on the screen and warm the little
white underside of his body. But
soon it would get too hot for him;
and then do you think he would climb
down again? Not at all. He would
look at his lady out of his big black
eyes, and nod his head at her as
much as to say, “Come and take me
down,”&mdash;which she always did.

So, you see, he was very much petted
and spoiled. Everybody in the house
petted and spoiled him&mdash;excepting
the cats, and they longed to pet him,
and I am perfectly sure that if they
had done so they would have completely
spoiled him.





[78]



IV

LITTLE MITCHELL’S CAT NEIGHBORS

Peterkin, Jack, Hallet, and Goliah,&mdash;these
were the cats. Peterkin and
the lady had been great friends.
Peterkin was a very proud cat and
a very handsome one, dark and tiger-striped.
He used to come into the
lady’s room a great deal, and sometimes
he would sleep all night on the
couch under the window.

When the lady got back from her
visit to Mount Mitchell, Peterkin was
glad, and ran up to her room; but, to
his amazement, she did not invite him
in. She even shut the door in his
face.

Peterkin walked off with his tail in
the air, and never came to see her[79]
again. She tried to explain, but it was
no use; Peterkin never forgave her.

He was a very wise cat, and likely
enough, if she had shown Baby Mitchell
to him, he would have understood
and been very good; but she was
afraid to risk it, for Baby Mitchell was
such a tender little dot that if Peterkin
had not understood, or had not understood
soon enough, there might have
been a sad ending to the little Black
Mountain baby. For, you see, no
matter how sorry Peterkin might have
been after it was all over, or no matter
how well he might have understood
after he had done it, that wouldn’t
have helped Baby Mitchell any after
he had been eaten up. So Peterkin
was gently but firmly refused admittance;
and, as I said, he never got
over it.

Peterkin was a wise cat, but not so
wise as his mother. Peterkin’s mother[80]
was called Grandma, and she was the
wisest cat I ever knew. She was a
little cat, striped like Peterkin, but not
handsome like him, for she had had a
very hard time when she was young,
and that perhaps is why she was so
wise.

She belonged to people who were
not kind to her, and they often teased
and hurt her, and they did not give
her enough to eat. So she did not
grow large nor handsome, because one
must have the right kind of food and
care when one is young in order to
grow properly.

But she learned a great deal about
people and how to look out for herself;
so when she came to live with the gentleman
and the gentleman’s wife and
catch mice for them, she was a wise
little cat as well as a homely one.

But they did not know she was
homely, for they found out what a[81]
loving little heart she had, and how
wise she was; and, you know, it
doesn’t matter at all how homely
you are if you are only loving and
thoughtful and quick and kind. Indeed,
you will seem quite beautiful to
those about you,&mdash;more beautiful than
if you looked prettier and were less
kind and loving.

So the little Grandma soon won
the hearts of her new friends. Jack
and Hallet were her grandchildren,
and fine fellows they were, so big and
black and striped,&mdash;real tiger-cats.

It was strange that such a little cat
as Grandma should have such large,
handsome children and grandchildren;
but then, you see, she might have
been large and handsome herself if she
had been properly cared for when she
was young.

Well, Grandma’s daughter Ann was
the mother of Jack and Hallet. Before[82]
Jack and Hallet were born their
mother Ann was in great trouble,
because every time before all but one
of her kittens had mysteriously disappeared,
and after a while that one
disappeared too.

She seemed to know that the gentleman
and the gentleman’s wife were
somehow to blame for this, for she
had always had her kittens in the
house, and had taken great pride in
showing them to her human friends as
soon as they were born. This time
she and Grandma were noticed having
a great consultation together; that
means, you know, that they seemed
to be talking it over. Finally, she and
Grandma went off, Grandma leading
the way.

The gentleman wondered what it
was all about, and watched them
without their knowing it. Grandma
led Lady Ann up the long hill back[83]
of the house to an old barn, way off
where hay was stored. Into this barn
they went, and in a nice soft bed of
hay Jack and Hallet were born; and
not a word did these two conspirators
say to their human friends about the
two handsome kits up in the old hay
barn.

But when the kittens were half
grown,&mdash;too big to disappear, you
know,&mdash;their mother proudly took
them home and showed them to the
gentleman and his wife, who were also
very proud of them, they were so
handsome.

Well, they were Jack and Hallet,
and they lived to be old and very
well behaved cats, and they were always
handsome. Little Goliah was
Grandma’s own child; but he never
was much of a kit, for Grandma was
very old&mdash;that is, old for a cat&mdash;when
he was born. She hid him[84]
away until he was a big kit, for she
wanted to save him from disappearing;
and because he was her youngest he
was also her favorite. Even after he
was grown up, she would wash his
face and brush his coat with her rough
tongue. She treated him as though
he were a little kitten until she died
of old age.

And Goliah was always a weak kit,
and not nearly as large nor as handsome
as the others, and not so very
wise. But the gentleman’s wife took
the best of care of him for Grandma’s
sake.

The very funniest, cunningest thing
Grandma ever did was to bring the
kit that sat on the sticky fly-paper to
her mistress. This happened before
Grandma got to be so old. The
kitten was very young, and it was her
grandchild, the child of her daughter
Sue.

[85]

One day the little fuzzy kit sat
down on the sticky fly-paper that the
girls who worked in the kitchen had
left lying around. They had been forbidden
to use it, for fear a kit might sit
on it; and how they got the fly-paper
anyway is a mystery. For the gentleman
and his wife had built their pretty
log-house away out in the mountains,
thirty or forty miles from a railroad,
and there were no shops in the mountains
where one could go to buy
things.

Probably the fly-paper had been
sent by mistake with the things
ordered from the far-away big city.
Things were always being sent by
mistake.

So the kit sat down on the fly-paper.
Then it rolled over on it, trying to get
loose.

The girls took it up as soon as they
saw it, but it was a dreadful-looking[86]
kitten by the time they got it free.
Its fur was all stuck together, and its
paws and its ears and everything were
terribly stuck up.

Then its mother and Grandma tried
to put it to rights, and they licked and
licked and licked, but the more they
licked the worse it looked. There
was no doing anything with it.

Finally the gentleman and his wife,
who were in the sitting-room, heard
Grandma crying very loudly at the
door. They wondered what had happened,
and opening the door saw
Grandma on the step. She was talking
very fast,&mdash;in her meow talk, you
know,&mdash;and behind her stood Mother
Sue with the kitten in her mouth.

They had done all they could, and
now they had come for help to the
gentleman and his wife.

[87]


     
     Little Mitchell Washes his Face
“Out there in the corn-field he climbed quickly up to her shoulder, and sat
there and washed his face with his little hands.” (Page 125)


[88]

The gentleman was very angry
when he saw the fix the kitten was
in, and the careless girls in the kitchen
got a good scolding, which I am sure
they deserved. But before he took
time to do any scolding, the gentleman
got something that would soften
the sticky stuff, and he and his wife
very carefully cleaned the baby kitten’s
fur, and then washed it with
warm water and soap, and rubbed it
dry. It was hours before they got
that kitten put to rights.

Well, those were the cats that lived
around Baby Mitchell; and if he had
only had a number of lives, no doubt
the kittens could have been taught,
after they had killed him a few times,
that they must not hurt him. But as
he had only one life, he couldn’t very
well spare that; and so the kits had to
be shut out of the room where he was.

I think they knew he was there, for
they used to smell about the door and
act as kits do when they think there[89]
is a mouse inside. Not that Baby
Mitchell smelled at all like a mouse,&mdash;indeed,
he was the sweetest, cleanest
little dot that ever wore a fur coat,&mdash;never
any unpleasant odor about him.
But kits can smell so much sharper
than we, that they no doubt knew
there was some little chap in there,
and they no doubt thought the little
stranger needed their attention. For
they were famous hunters, and caught
all the mice on the place, as well as
all the squirrels and birds they could,
and even the rabbits.

Of course it was too bad for them to
catch the birds and squirrels; but they
were not really to blame, for they did
not know any better. They thought
all little animals ought to be eaten up
by kits, if kits could catch them.

Not that they ever got very hungry,
for they always had enough, and more
than enough, in their plates around[90]
at the back of the kitchen. Every
morning and evening, when the man
brought the fresh milk, their dishes
were filled, and when they heard him
sing out, “Poos, p-ooo-s, p-ooo-s,”
they would come running out of the
woods, or from under the house, or off
the porch, or wherever they happened
to be,&mdash;for no matter how many mice
and squirrels and birds they had eaten
they were always able to drink a little
milk.

It was fun to see their heads close
together in the dish; only Goliah
would never eat with the others. He
had to have his dish separate, and
sometimes he would not eat at all
unless his mistress took him in the
house and let him sit by her chair.
He would not even eat the nice meat
and things the gentleman’s wife gave
the kits every day unless she fixed a
plate for him all by himself.

[91]

By this time you will have guessed
that the gentleman’s wife was fond
of kittens.

Long ago, when Grandma was
young, there were twenty kits to take
care of. They were all Grandma’s
children or grandchildren, and they accumulated
before the gentleman’s wife
could harden her heart enough to
cause some of them to disappear when
they were first born. Those were
great days for the cats! And it was
a sight to see them come running
when the man brought in the milk
and called “Poos, p-ooo-s, p-ooo-s.”

It was a sight, too, to see them go
walking with the family. When the
gentleman and his wife would start for
a walk in the cool of the evening, all
the kits would go tagging on behind,
with their tails in the air, as proud
as you please. But as years passed,
some of them died of old age or otherwise[92]
disappeared, until finally there
were only Peterkin, Jack, Hallet,
and Goliah left,&mdash;a very harmonious
family, all but Goliah, who was sometimes
cross to the other kits, and
would growl at them and slap their
faces, which seemed to astonish them
very much.

Peterkin, Jack, Hallet, and Goliah
were the only cats that belonged
there when Baby Mitchell appeared
upon the scene. Not that Baby
Mitchell was seen much, for he stayed
in his lady’s room, with the door shut,
all the time.

But Billy came every day to drink
the milk and eat the good things the
other cats had. Billy belonged to the
man who brought the milk, and he
had plenty to eat at home. Still, he
liked to come, and the gentleman’s
wife let him, because he was related to
Grandma too. He was a funny-looking[93]
cat, rather square in shape, and
he had a way of scratching with his
hind legs, like a dog. He was cross
to Goliah and would cuff him when he
got a chance.

Then there was Lady Jane. He
had one white eye and a torn ear.
He was a very dissipated-looking cat,
and he had evidently fought a great
many fights. Why he was called
Lady Jane, I am sure I do not know.
He was not related to Grandma, and
nobody knew where he came from.
He did not fight the kits that belonged
to the gentleman’s wife, at
least not when he came to get something
to eat. And though she did
not like his looks, the gentleman’s
wife was too kind-hearted to drive
him away.

When summer was over, the gentleman
and his wife went away to
their other home in a Northern city;[94]
but you must not suppose they left
their cats to suffer. No, indeed! The
kits had a warm house of their own
to sleep in, and there was a little
door left open at the back of it so that
they could go into the kitchen if they
wanted to. They were good neat cats,
that never abused this privilege.

Every day, all winter long, the man
came with fresh milk, night and
morning, and called “P-ooo-s, p-ooo-s,
p-ooo-s.” And two or three times a
week they had fresh meat, or, best of
all, canned salmon. The gentleman
left a whole case of salmon for them
every year, and they loved it better
than anything else,&mdash;for you know
cats are very fond of fish. Some cats
will even go fishing for themselves if
they live near the water.

[95]


     
     Little Mitchell Likes Chinkapins
“He sat on the Lady’s knee and cracked chinkapins, and would give the shells
a toss that sent them far away.” (Page 132)


[96]

Baby Mitchell’s lady once had a cat
whose name was Little Man Friday,
and he would catch his own fish out
of a little bayou that came up from
the Gulf of Mexico, on whose shore
the lady lived. For Little Man Friday
was a Florida cat, and perhaps some
day you may like to hear his story,
and how he got his name.

Grandma and the other kits knew
perfectly well when the gentleman
and his wife were packing their trunks
to go North, and it made the poor kits
very unhappy. It made Grandma so
dreadfully unhappy toward the end of
her life that they used to do it slyly,
and not let her see the preparations
for going away.

Well, there isn’t any more about
Peterkin, Jack, Hallet, and Goliah.
They came into the story only because
they lived in Baby Mitchell’s house&mdash;no,
Baby Mitchell lived in their house
a little while, and they didn’t eat
him up, although they were such near
neighbors.





[97]



V

LITTLE MITCHELL STARTS OUT TO
SEE THE WORLD


It was soon time for Little
Mitchell’s lady to go back to her
home in Boston.

“What are you going to do with
that little squirrel?” asked her friend
the gentleman in whose house she
stayed.

“I shall try to take him with me,”
said she.

“Of course you will,” said her friend
the gentleman’s wife. She knew how
it is about kittens, you see, and how
you get attached to them and do not
like to give them away to other people
who may not always remember to take
good care of them.

[98]

So the lady told Little Mitchell he
should go to Boston with her. He
didn’t say whether he wanted to go
or not, but of course he did want to
go,&mdash;for what could the little fellow
have done without his lady? He was
still such a baby, and slept more than
anything else, and still drank his milk
out of a spoon as you drink out of a
tumbler. But how he did hate to
have his mouth wiped! When he had
done drinking milk, his lady would
wipe his mouth off on a soft napkin,
and he never forgot to scream and
cry when she did it. He was like
some other naughty children.

Oh no, he didn’t like to have a
dirty face,&mdash;that wasn’t it. But he
liked to wipe his mouth himself, and
the trouble is he wouldn’t always wipe
it in the right place. Sometimes he
would wipe it on the napkin, like a
good little squirrel; but he preferred[99]
to squirm out of his lady’s hand and
wipe it on her dress, and of course she
did not like that.

She would often give him a drink
of cold water, and he seemed to enjoy
that almost as much as the milk,
though the gentleman said he ought
not to have it, for his own mother
would not have given him cold water.
But the lady only laughed, and said
the reason that mother squirrels did
not give their babies cold water was
because they had no tumblers in
which to carry it.

Anyway, he enjoyed the cold water,
and he grew fast, and seemed a very
healthy, happy little fellow; and if
he ever had a stomach-ache he said
nothing at all about it. So I do not
believe he ever had one, for if anything
was really the matter with him
he was quick enough to make a fuss.

The day came at last for the lady[100]
to say good-bye to her dear friends,
the gentleman and the gentleman’s
wife, and Peterkin, Jack, Hallet, and
Goliah, and Sally and Lenoir.

Who were Sally and Lenoir? Why,
don’t you know? Sally was the white
horse with the long mane, and when
the long forelock was parted down
over her face she looked just like the
beautiful picture of Rosa Bonheur’s
horse; and Lenoir was the black
horse, just as handsome as Sally, but
not so famous-looking.

The gentleman and the gentleman’s
wife said good-bye to Little
Mitchell; but Peterkin, Jack, Hallet,
and Goliah did not, for they were
not allowed to. The lady gave Peterkin
a kiss on the top of his head between
his ears, because she liked him
very much and felt sorry that he was
offended with her.

Then the man who was to drive her[101]
and Little Mitchell away in the carriage
snapped his whip, the two mules
started off at a trot down the driveway,
and Little Mitchell and the lady
were off,&mdash;not exactly for Boston, because
they had to go to a good many
places before they could get there.

And first, they had to go to Grandfather
Mountain.

Of course they took a long and
lovely drive that day, but there were
no deep rivers to cross, only some
dear little streams, all ripply and shiny
where the sun got through to them
under the tall trees.

After a while they came to a schoolhouse,
buried deep in the shady forest.
It was not vacation, and as it was recess,
all the little barefooted boys and
girls stood and looked at the carriage
and the lady and the driver.

It was not often that anybody passed
the schoolhouse on that lonely road,[102]
and they were very much interested.
The lady was very much interested
too. They were such bright, pretty
little barefooted people. So she got
out and spoke to the schoolmaster,
and to the children, who gathered
shyly about her and looked into her
face so sweetly that she wanted to
kiss them all.

After the lady and Little Mitchell
and the driver had gone ever so far
past the schoolhouse, they stopped for
dinner. The mules had some corn
and some dried corn-leaves to eat,
and the lady had sandwiches and
cake and jam and lots of other good
things out of a box that the gentleman’s
wife had given her; and the
driver had all he wanted too. But
of course Little Mitchell had condensed
milk again; the gentleman’s
wife had given the lady a nice fresh
can of it for him. When he had[103]
eaten his dinner, he stretched out on
his lady’s knee and took a sun-bath
and a nap while she read in a book.

Then he was put back in his little
box, and they all went on again,
through more lovely forests and over
the Blue Ridge Mountain, which is
not so very high along here. The
road was rather rough and steep in
places; but you know what a sleepy-head
Little Mitchell was, so the jolting
of the carriage did not wake him
up.

Well, toward night they got to a
little hotel near the beautiful Linville
Falls. Here they stayed until next
morning; but Little Mitchell did not
sleep in a feather-bed this time, because,
you know, he had his own little
box, with nice warm cotton to cuddle
down in.

Of course the children who lived
here had to have a peep at the funny[104]
little fellow. The children’s mother
gave him some milk for his supper,
and then the lady put him to bed.

Next morning the lady and Little
Mitchell and the driver went on, and
at noon they had their dinner again
by the roadside, and Little Mitchell
again had his condensed milk, and
screamed as naughty as could be
when his mouth was wiped, and
stretched himself on his lady’s knee
in the sun.

Toward night they climbed a long
sloping road up the side of the Grandfather
Mountain. It was a beautiful
smooth road, not at all jolty; and
soon they came to a white house on
the mountain side, the only house for
several miles.

Here the driver left them and returned
to his own home; but Little
Mitchell and the lady stayed there
several days.

[105]

Little Mitchell did not care about
the beauty of the mountains, but the
lady did. She used to go out and
walk, and leave him at home asleep.
Sometimes she walked up toward the
top of the great Grandfather Mountain,&mdash;that
rocky top, as black as
ink, which you can see miles and
miles away. It is black because the
sharp rocky ridge wears a dress of
lichens as black as coals. I don’t
know why such black lichens grow
all over Grandfather’s top, but they
do, and below the black rocks is a
wide belt of dark green balsam firs
that you know look black in the distance;
so it is a very stern-looking
Grandfather Mountain indeed.

Why is it called the Grandfather
Mountain?

Well, if you walk along a road that
is at the north side of it you will come
to a place where you can look across[106]
and see standing out from the side of
the mountain a great stone face, like
the face of an old, old man; and it is
from this profile the mountain gets its
name.

Where Little Mitchell’s lady walked
down in the woods below, it was not
black at all, but very bright and
sweet, with fine trees growing; for it
is only near the top that the balsam
firs are found.

Some of the forest leaves had already
changed their color; for it was
early fall now, and the woods were all
golden in the sunshine, and the yellow
witch hazel was everywhere in bloom.

Along the edges of the road were
little piles of acorn shells. These
were the work of the squirrel folk.
They had shelled out the green
acorns, and of course they must have
eaten the inside part, or kernel. Every
little pile of shells showed where a
squirrel had sat and eaten acorns, or
perhaps he had been on a limb of
the tree above and dropped the shells
down.

[107]


     
     Little Mitchell on a Frolic
“Hop, hop, went Little Mitchell, all up and down the room.” (Page 142)


[108]

The lady tasted one of the green
acorns, but it was so bitter and puckery
she made up a queer face over it.
But she put some of the acorns in
her pocket for Little Mitchell. Since
the other squirrels liked them so
much, she thought perhaps he would
like them too; but when she gave
them to him he only played with
them, and did not even try to eat
one.

It was about this time that Little
Mitchell began to sit up. Such a
funny, floppy sitting up as it was!
He did not hold his back up straight,
but got himself all into a queer little
heap, and the best he could do was to
keep from tumbling over. But no
doubt he felt very proud of himself,[109]
and imagined he was a big grown-up
squirrel.

He wasn’t, though, for he could not
crack even an acorn; and he still
drank milk, though he had learned to
love sugar cookies. His lady would
give him a little piece of one, and he
liked it so much he almost choked
himself to death trying to stuff it
down his throat too fast.

You may know what a baby he was
when I tell you how he ran into the
fireplace.

The first time he tried it, there was
no fire there, and he started to go up
the chimney, and his lady caught him
just in time and pulled him down all
black and sooty.

The next time there was a fire;
but that didn’t matter to Little
Mitchell. He ran right into it, and
burned the whiskers all off one side
of his face, and the lady snatched him[110]
out just in time to prevent his poor
little nose from getting burned too.
He was so surprised that he didn’t
even try to get out. You see, he was
such a baby!

Of course he slept in his little box
of cotton, and one cold night his lady
was awakened in the middle of the
night by a great commotion. She
heard something scratching frantically
somewhere, and Little Mitchell was
screaming and crying like everything.

She jumped up and got a light, and
there was Little Mitchell’s box wiggling
about as though bewitched. He
was inside, scratching and thumping
about and crying with all his might.
What could be the matter?

You remember it was a cold night,
and the lady concluded the little fellow
was cold, and so she took him
out. The moment he got into her
warm hand, he stopped crying; so,[111]
not knowing what else to do, she
took him to bed with her, and he
curled down at her side under her
hand and went to sleep like a good
little kitten.

When he woke up in the morning,
what do you think he did? He licked
his lady’s hand first; then he began to
play with her fingers, making believe
to bite them, and patting them with
his little paws and jumping away just
as a kitten does.

They had a real good frolic. Little
Mitchell would scamper down to the
foot of the bed under the covers, then
come creeping up until close to the
lady’s hand, when she would poke it
at him and he would scurry off again.

So he kept on playing until it was
time to get up; then the lady left him
alone, all covered up in the warm bed,
and he curled right up and went to
sleep until she was ready to go downstairs,[112]
when she put him in his little
box, which he didn’t like at all, you
may be sure. But there was a fire
now, so the room was warm; and soon
his lady brought him his breakfast of
warm milk and a little piece of sugar
cooky.

Of course the lady always remembered
the baby bunny asleep in his
nest at home, when she went out to
walk; and if she saw anything she
thought he would like, she brought it
home to him.

One day she brought him some
chestnuts. They were the very first
ones to get ripe. Indeed, they were
not ripe enough to fall out of their
burrs of themselves; but when their
burrs were pounded open with a stone,
out they slipped, fine, fat, shiny brown
ones. And so big they were! That
is because they grew on the dear and
lovely Grandmother Mountain, which[113]
you know is not so high as Grandfather
Mountain, but close to it, and
very beautiful, covered with all sorts
of delightful growths. And its chestnuts
are so big! They grow on little
low trees, so little you would hardly
expect to find any nuts on them;
but their tops are just covered with
big, round, splendid burrs full of big,
plump, brown nuts that are as sweet
as any nuts can be. The lady took
some of these nuts home, but she
did not give them to Little Mitchell
until she had roasted them in the hot
ashes and made them quite soft. Then
she gave him one, and the baby took
it in his hands, and sat up as well as
he could, and looked very wise indeed.
But he was just making believe, for he
didn’t know in the least what to do
with that nut. He sniffed at it, but
seemed to have no idea what was
inside, until the lady opened it for[114]
him. Then he ate a piece of it, gnawing
it with his four little front teeth,
and liked it very much.

Every day after that he had roasted
chestnuts with his milk.

Oh yes, indeed, he soon learned to
know them with the shell on, and to
take it off too. He would bite it loose,
and then give it a fling that sent it
ever so far.

Thus they lived and had good times
on the side of the beautiful Grandfather
Mountain for more than a week.
Then one day the lady’s trunk was
taken off by a mule team to Blowing
Rock; but she and Little Mitchell did
not go with it. They went around on
the other side of the mountain.





[115]



VI

LITTLE MITCHELL REFUSES TO LEAVE
HIS LADY

Little Mitchell in his box, and
the lady on her two feet, started off to
go to the other side of Grandfather
Mountain. They were on the south
side now, you know, and they wanted
to get to the north side.

The way is to go across a sheep
pasture, and climb a fence, and go
across an old garden, or what once
was a garden, and climb another fence,
and then you are in the wild woods,
with a pretty winding path in front of
you and service trees overhead dropping
down ripe red berries for you to
eat, if you go at the right time of
year. Little Mitchell and his lady
were too late for the berries, but[116]
they went along under the pretty service
trees.

Well, you go on down the path into
the deep, deep forest, with the big old
oaks and beeches and other trees about
you, and the sunbeams dancing in and
out, making the forest all motley like
the skin of a leopard.

You go down steeper and steeper,
until you come to the end of the path
and enter a road that runs at right
angles to it.

It is a fearful road, full of loose stones
and great rocks, such as you find in
the bed of a stream. Indeed, it is the
dry bed of a stream, and the stream
itself, in another bed near by, is the
very beginning of the Linville River,
and you keep having to cross over the
river any way you can, by jumping
from stone to stone, and sometimes
slipping off and getting wet.

Sometimes this queer road runs right[117]
up the river bed; and then you walk
along the edge of it, along a winding
path through the rhododendrons.

There were some mountain people
going along the road when Little
Mitchell and the lady got to it that
day. There were a man, a boy, a
horse and wagon, and two young
girls; and they were all walking, because
it was easier to walk than to go
tilting and jolting and jiggling over all
those stones. Besides, the horse was
not strong enough to pull anything but
the wagon over such a road, and so
they showed Little Mitchell’s lady how
to get across the young Linville by
jumping on the stones.

Little Mitchell was asleep in his box,
which of course the lady carried as
carefully as she could, so that he
didn’t know nor care anything about
all this.

They went gayly along together,[118]
until they got to the house where Little
Mitchell’s lady was to stop. It was
a wild place, close to the great Grandfather
Mountain; but it was very
sweet, with the fresh air and the tinkly
stream across the road in front of the
house.

The stream was not the Linville,&mdash;they
had left that behind. It was the
beginning of the Watauga River, that
flows in exactly the opposite direction
from the Linville, and has trout hiding
in its pools.

The house stands on such a steep
slope! You look out of the front windows
across the narrow Watauga
valley, which is nothing but a gorge
here, and see the Grandfather Mountain
rising up like a tremendous wall
all covered with trees.

[119]


     
     Little Mitchell in his Box
“There he lay on his back, like a hot, tired, human
little baby.” (Page 152)


[120]

But back of the house, where the
trees have been cut away, the steep
slopes are just covered with wild strawberries.
Such big, sweet berries!
Why, they are as big as your thumb;
mind, I say as big as your thumb, not
as big as mine, which is quite another
matter. But anyway they are big
enough. Of course there were none
then,&mdash;it was too late; but in the
early summer I should like to see you
climb that slope without wetting your
feet in strawberry juice! You couldn’t
do it, they are so thick. And sweet?&mdash;Well,
you should just taste them!

Little Mitchell and his lady stayed
all night in the house at the foot of
the strawberry slope, and the people
who lived there were pleased, for they
knew Little Mitchell’s lady, and were
glad to see him too. They thought
him the cunningest baby they had ever
seen. He ran about the room, and
climbed on the table, and washed his
face, and played with his lady, and
looked up the big stone chimney. He[121]
almost had a mind to run up it; but
his lady said no, so he ate his supper
of roasted chestnuts and fresh milk,
and went to bed in his little box.

Next morning the woman who kept
the house went with Little Mitchell
and his lady on a lovely walk over the
mountains to where her mother lived.

When noon came, they were only
half-way there; so they sat down on a
sweet mountain-side, to rest and eat,
and Little Mitchell’s lady took him
out of his box and gave him sugar
cooky and roasted chestnuts for his
dinner. She thought he could get
along without milk now for a little
while, because it was so hard to carry
it.

He had grown to be quite a squirrel
by this time, and the lady thought
that perhaps he was old enough to
care for himself, and would like to be
set free in the woods, which is the best[122]
home for the little squirrel-folk, you
know.

So she looked at him as he sat on
her knee eating his chestnuts, which
he held in his funny little hands and
nibbled very fast indeed. He could
sit up pretty well now, and yet he did
look like such a baby!

Still, she thought perhaps she ought
to let him go free; and here in this
wild spot, where there were no cats to
catch him, was a good place.

So when he had finished his dinner
she put him down on the ground near
a little tree, and then went back and
sat down where she had been before,
some distance away.

What do you think Little Mitchell
did now?

He looked around at the big, wild,
lonely forest, and then at his dear
lady, and he ran and scrambled and
scampered as fast as his little legs[123]
could carry him,&mdash;not up the tree, oh
no, indeed!&mdash;but straight back to his
lady. He climbed into her lap and
stuck his head up her sleeve, and
seemed glad to be at home again.

You see, the little fellow was afraid,
and no doubt it made him feel very
bad to think that maybe he was to be
left there all alone.

But you may be sure the lady did
not leave him after that. She tucked
him into his little box, where he curled
right up and went to sleep; and when
they started on again, she carried along
the box with Little Mitchell in it.

After all, there were no sugar cookies
and roasted chestnuts in the woods for
the little fellow.

They spent the night at the woman’s
mother’s house, and next morning
Little Mitchell and his lady went on
to Blowing Rock, which is several
miles away.

[124]

But it was a glorious walk,&mdash;first
through the beautiful forest, and then
out into a corn-field where the cornstalks
were rustling their brown leaves
in the breeze.

When they got to the corn-field, the
lady took Little Mitchell out of the box;
the sun was warm, and she thought
he would enjoy it,&mdash;for he was getting
too big now to stay shut up all day.

So she opened the box-cover and
out popped Little Mitchell. He
climbed quickly up to her shoulder,
and sat there and washed his face
with his hands very fast indeed.

He looked so cunning washing his
face, that the lady always liked to see
him do it. First he would flatten his
ears down close to his head, then he
would put his face into his two hands
held close together, and scrub very
fast, rubbing all over his ears and
back of them.

[125]

He did not lick his paws to moisten
them, as a cat does, for he did not
seem to have much moisture in his
little mouth. His tongue was very
small, and as soft as velvet. But
when he wanted to wash his face,
now, what do you think he did?
Why, he blew his nose hard into his
hands, and then washed away! What
he got from his little nose was very
clean and watery, just as clean as what
puss gets on her paws when she licks
them. Yes, it does seem strange to
you, but that is the way the squirrel-folk
all do. If you were a squirrel,
you would think it queer to do any
other way.

Well, Little Mitchell, out there in
the corn-field, sat up on his lady’s
shoulder and washed his face until he
was satisfied; then he climbed all
over her, up and down and around,
clear down to the hem of her dress.

[126]

She was afraid he would get a little
too frisky, and jump down to the
ground and get lost; but, dear me!
she needn’t have worried about that.
Jump down? He wouldn’t have left
his lady that day among those rustling
cornstalks, not for the whole
world. He just climbed about for
fun and exercise; but when the corn-leaves
rustled, how scared he was!
He scrambled as fast as he could
down the lady’s arm and up into her
coat-sleeve; and when she got him
out, back he went as soon as a corn-blade
rustled near them.

“You must be hungry,” she said,
when at last she had him cuddled up
in her hand. So she picked an ear of
corn, and they sat down and pulled off
the husk and all the long soft silk that
was inside, and Little Mitchell had
some of the kernels.

He took them in his little hands,[127]
one at a time, and looked up at his
lady out of his bright eyes with such
a wise air! He turned the kernel of
corn over, and sniffed at it until he
found the germ that lies in one side,&mdash;the
little thing that sprouts when you
plant the corn,&mdash;and he pulled this
out with his sharp front teeth, and ate
it very fast; but the rest of the kernel
he threw away. Not a bit of it
would he eat but that! You see the
germ was soft and sweet, and pleased
the little chap.

If all squirrels eat corn in that way,
it is no wonder the farmers worry
when they make a raid on the cornfields
in the early autumn!

When Mitchell had eaten all the
tender corn-germs he wanted, they
went on; and the very next blade
that rustled near them&mdash;pop!&mdash;he
was over the lady’s shoulder, up
under her jacket, and in the top of[128]
her sleeve. She had to stop and take
off her jacket and extract him. He
kept on at this trick until finally she
put him in his box and fastened the
cover down,&mdash;which, after all, was
just what he wanted, for he was
tired, and he curled right up and
went fast asleep and gave her no more
trouble.

Away they went, down the mountain,
across the valley, up another
mountain, and down into the Watauga
valley, where the river is larger and
where the chinkapins grow.

It is the same valley where stands
the house on the strawberry slope,&mdash;only
the Watauga River is not a tinkling
trout-brook down here, but quite
a proud stream, though it still has
trout in its pools.

Of course, when they got among the
chinkapins they stopped to gather
some,&mdash;for these were ripe, if the[129]
strawberries were not, and there were
plenty of them too.

What are chinkapins?

Why, don’t you know? All the
children who live in the South know
what chinkapins are,&mdash;at least, all
who live where they grow know.

They are not berries! No, guess
again.

Yes, nuts; little shiny brown nuts,
like baby chestnuts. The mountain
children often string them for beads,
they are so pretty. They grow in
little burrs, like tiny chestnut burrs;
but there is only one nut in a burr instead
of two or three, and they grow
on bushes or little trees, with leaves
like chestnut leaves, only smaller.

No, chinkapins are not shaped quite
like chestnuts; they are not flat anywhere.
Chestnuts have to be flat on
at least one side, because they grow
three in a burr, and are squeezed[130]
against each other, so the middle
chestnut is flat on both sides, but the
others are flat only on the inside and
rounded on the outside. But the
chinkapin is rounded on both sides,
because it is alone in its burr, with
nothing to flatten against. Oh no, it
is not round all over like a marble,&mdash;it
is like a tiny chestnut, only it is
rounded instead of being flattened on
its sides.

I wish I could give you a handful
of shiny chinkapins, then you would
know just how they look.

Children who do not live near chinkapins
need to know about them because
of “Uncle Remus.” When you
read how “Brer Rabbit” sat on a
chinkapin log, combing his hair with
a chip, you ought to know what a
chinkapin log is like.

[131]


     
     Little Mitchell’s Visitor
“He scampered off as if the old cat were after him.” (Page 158)


[132]

Chinkapins being so small, and only
one in a burr, you can imagine they
are not easy to gather until Jack
Frost comes along with his sharp
fingers and splits open all the tiny
burrs on all the little chinkapin trees.
Then you have only to shake the trees
or beat the bushes, and patter! patter!
patter!&mdash;out will come jumping the
pretty brown chinkapins, as thick as
rain-drops in a summer shower, and all
you have to do is to get down and
pick them up.

Mitchell liked the little nuts, they
are so sweet, and he could crack them
for himself because the shells are soft,
like chestnut shells. So he sat on the
lady’s knee in the chinkapin patch,
and cracked chinkapins, and when he
had succeeded in getting a shell off he
would give it a toss that sent it far
away.

The lady ate chinkapins too, they
were so sweet and good; but Little
Mitchell did not quite like that,&mdash;he[133]
seemed to think she was eating his
nuts, and once in a while he would
reach up and snatch away her chinkapin,
and scold and chatter at her.
That was because he was hungry,
and thought he wanted them all; but
when he had had enough he let her
eat what she wanted too.

Presently along came Phyllis Amaranth,
Lucy Ansonia Belindy, and
Mollie May. Of course they came
with their pretty feet bare, and none of
them were more than seven years old.

They just smiled and smiled, and
clasped their hands tight together,
when they saw Little Mitchell. But
he kept one eye on them, and when
they came too near he ran and hid
in the folds of his lady’s dress. He
didn’t care for little girls, and he was
terribly afraid they might touch him.

So Phyllis Amaranth, Lucy Ansonia
Belindy, and Mollie May ran to the[134]
chinkapin bushes and shook them, and
picked up the chinkapins very fast,
and gave them to Mitchell’s lady for
him, so that she soon had all she could
carry without the trouble of picking
any up. That is the way with these
mountain people; they will give you
something if they possibly can.

Then they all said good-bye to each
other, and Little Mitchell and the lady
went on. They crossed the Watauga
valley, which is easy enough, it is so
narrow; then they crossed the Watauga
River, which is hard enough, the
bridge is so narrow, and so high up in
the air, and wobbles so you are afraid
of your life to go over it,&mdash;but you
have to, or else stay on the wrong side
of the river, which, you understand,
is quite a river here, very swift and
rather deep.

But they got safely over the wobbly
bridge, and went on through the forest,[135]
only stopping a few minutes to look at
a birch-still.

A birch-still is a place where they
distil birch-oil out of birch-bark. Do
you know how it is done? Well,
you ought to, for you eat so much
birch-oil. You don’t think you ever
ate any birch-oil in your life? Oh,
but I know you have eaten it. I am
perfectly sure you sometimes eat wintergreen
candy and other things flavored
with wintergreen. That is, you
call it wintergreen; but it is not that
at all, it is birch. You see the flavor
is the same, and it is much easier to
get it out of the birch.

The way they do is to strip the bark
from the young black-birch trees,&mdash;which
of course kills the trees, and
that is too bad; but they do it, and
chop the bark into little pieces, which
they put into a long wooden box with
a zinc bottom.

[136]

When the box is full of bark, they
put in some water, and fit on the cover,
and plaster all the cracks with clay
until the box is air-tight,&mdash;all but a
little round hole in the cover that has
a lead pipe fitted into it.

Then they build a fire in the fire-hole
under the box, and soon the
steam from the boiling water escapes
through the pipe that is fitted in the
cover. The pipe is coiled up in a
barrel of water when it leaves the box,
and is kept cool by a little stream of
water which runs into the barrel all
the time.

Of course the steam that escapes
through the pipe is turned back to
water when it becomes cooled, passing
through the coil in the barrel, and
finally runs out of the other end of the
pipe into a bottle. There is birch-oil
in the steam that goes over, and the
oil runs into the bottle with the water,[137]
but being heavier than water it sinks
to the bottom of the bottle. When
the bottle is full, the water runs out at
the top; but when it gets full of oil,
they do not allow that to run over,&mdash;they
take away the bottle of oil and
put an empty bottle in its place.

Yes, I know that oil is said to float
on water, and some oil does, but birch-oil
is heavy, as I have told you, and
sinks to the bottom.

The people take the oil to the store
and exchange it for shoes and calico
and safety-pins, and all the things they
need. The storekeeper sells the oil
to the manufacturers, who purify it and
make it into flavoring extracts, and
then the druggists use it in making
medicines and tooth-powder, and the
candy-makers flavor some of their
candies with it, and the perfumers mix
it with other things to make perfumes
and scented soap. A great deal of[138]
this oil comes from the North Carolina
mountains, and is made in the woods,
as I have told you.

Well, when Little Mitchell’s lady
had looked at the birch-still long
enough, they went on until they got
to Blowing Rock. And this is a very
wonderful place.





[139]



VII

LITTLE MITCHELL’S FIRST CAR-RIDE

You can see three thunder-storms
at once from Blowing Rock.

Perhaps sometimes you can see
more than that number.

This is because Blowing Rock is on
the edge of a mountain, where you
can look off and off and off,&mdash;oh, so
far, over a sea of mountains, where
the storms gather. You know a
thunder-storm is not very big; it is
only as big as two or three clouds
close together, and these clouds may
be rather small.

It is queer to see the rain pouring
down in long straight lines over one
part of the mountains, while all the
rest is in sunshine.

[140]

Little Mitchell’s lady used to like to
watch the thunder-storms, but Little
Mitchell did not care anything about
them. He preferred going with the
lady to the big rock from which the
little village of Blowing Rock gets its
name. The Indians named it long
ago, because when the wind is in the
right quarter it blows so hard you cannot
throw anything over the rock. If
you try to throw your handkerchief or
your hat over, you cannot do it, because
the wind flings it back to you.
Sometimes it blows so strong you
couldn’t even jump over,&mdash;so people
say. But I should not like to try that,
no matter how hard the wind blew; it
is such a very long way down to the
tree-tops at the foot of the rock!

What Little Mitchell liked at the
big rock was the sunshine and the
fine places to run about; but he never
ran far from his lady, and at the[141]
slightest noise he would scurry back
to her.

There were some dear little children
at Blowing Rock; but you know how
Mitchell felt on that subject! He
would have nothing to do with them,
and if one of them took him up he
would squirm and squeal so that he
was quickly dropped.

It was at Blowing Rock that he
found out he could hop.

His lady used to let him out of his
box early in the morning, so that he
could run around the room and exercise
his muscles. She was afraid to
take him outside with her unless she
went a long way off, on account of
the cats.

So he would frolic with her, and
jump at her hand under the bed-covers
in the early morning, and when she
got up he would play about the room,
run over the table, look at everything[142]
on the bureau, including his own funny
little face in the looking-glass; and
one day he found out he could hop.

He went hop, hop, hop, just like a
grown-up squirrel, the whole length of
the room.

Hop, hop went Little Mitchell. He
had always crawled or crept about
before this; but that day he went hop,
hop, hop, all up and down the room,
and then up and down again.

When the lady was ready to go out,
she thought she would put him in his
box. He had never given her any
trouble before, but this time he scampered
under the bed, away over against
the wall out of reach, and there he
went hop, hop, hop, up and down, up
and down; but he never came out
from under the bed, because he did
not want the lady to catch him.

[143]


     
     Little Mitchell and his Wheel
“As soon as he moved the wheel began to turn, and he began to run.” (Page 170)


[144]

He looked so funny, hopping up
and down, and he was having such a
glorious time, that his lady did not like
to end it, and waited ever so long; but
as he kept on hopping, and showed
no sign of ever going to stop, she
finally got under the bed and captured
him.

You see he had found something
new to do, and he was as excited over it
as a child is over a new and delightful
game. When the lady put him in his
box, he squirmed and screamed; and
when she fastened the cover down, he
cried and scratched to get out. It
was too bad,&mdash;but what else could
the lady do? She did not want to
stay shut up in her room all day, and
she dared not leave him alone for fear
some one might open the door and a
cat get in.

But he was really tired by this time;
and when he found that crying and
scratching did no good, he curled up
and went to sleep. When the lady[145]
peeped into the room before going off,
he was as quiet as a mouse; and when
she returned, he was still sound asleep
in his little box.

Now about hopping,&mdash;that is the
way grown squirrels get over the
ground, in little jumps; and Baby
Mitchell was growing every day, not
only in size but in squirrel habits.
How do you suppose he knew about
hopping, when he had never seen a
squirrel hop? And how do you suppose
he knew about sitting up and
holding his nuts in his hands, when
he had never seen a squirrel do these
things? And how do you suppose he
knew about washing his face after the
funny manner of the squirrel folk, when
he had never seen another squirrel do
it?

I cannot tell you how he knew all
these things; but he did know them,
and as he grew older, more and more[146]
squirrel habits came to him, as you
shall see.

The lady stayed at Blowing Rock
only a few days; then one morning
she and Little Mitchell started off
down the long winding road in a carriage,&mdash;and
this was the end of their
life in the mountains.

At the end of that drive they got
onto a railway train, and went a little
way, and then changed to another
train,&mdash;only they had to wait a long
time between trains.

Little Mitchell’s lady was very sorry
for him now, because you see he was
getting big enough to run about, and
he had to take this long journey all
shut up in his little box.

But when they got to the station
where they had to wait so long, she
opened his box, and out he came. He
ran all over her as fast as he could go,
even jumping from her shoulder to the[147]
top of her head, and played with her
hair, which she told him was naughty.
Then he jumped down and ran all
around the tops of the benches, for there
was nobody else in the waiting-room.

After a while a gentleman came in to
wait for the train too, and he fell quite
in love with the playful little fellow,
and wanted to buy him to take home
to his children; but of course the lady
would not sell him.

At last the train came, and they got
on and rode awhile, and then got off
again to wait for another train. This
was in a large station, full of people
and lighted by electric lights.

Little Mitchell’s lady saw his box
bumping about, and heard something
inside go scratch, scratch, scratch. So
she took off the cover, and out came
Little Mitchell. He was very tired
from being shut up so long and carried
so fast in the jolty train, and he wanted[148]
to come out and see what was going
on. The electric lights and the crowd
and the strange sights and sounds all
excited him. His eyes shone, and
he was not satisfied to sit on his
lady’s shoulder and look about. He
wanted to leap upon the back of a
lady who was dressed in laces and furs.
He was determined to do it, too;
but every time his lady caught him
just as he was about to spring, and
told him he mustn’t.

How surprised the strange lady
would have been if he had done it!
And how frightened Little Mitchell
would have been! For, once there,
he would not have known what to do,
and would have wished himself back
on his own lady’s shoulder.

At last she went into a dark corner
with him, and let him sit on the seat
by her and look at the people while he
ate a piece of sugar cooky.

[149]

Then the train came, and they got
into the sleeping-car,&mdash;Little Mitchell
in his little box, of course.

He was a good squirrel all night,
and early in the morning the lady let
him look out of the window; but he
did not like that,&mdash;it frightened him
to see things rushing by so fast. He
preferred to race up and down in the
berth, and jump at the lady’s fingers
from under the edge of the blanket,
and turn somersaults when she made
believe catch him.

After a little while he got tired of
this play, and was quite willing to be
put into his box, where he stayed
quietly until they got to Jersey City,
and crossed the ferry, and went to the
Grand Central Station in New York
City, and got upon another train that
soon left the noisy city behind.

The noise and motion of the train
seemed to tire and confuse the little[150]
fellow, so that he was glad to stay
hidden away in his own box, which
was now the only thing that really
seemed like home to him,&mdash;for even
the lady had changed her skin, or at
least she had put on strange clothes,
which must have seemed to him just
like changing her skin.

When they left New York on the
train for Hartford,&mdash;which is where
they were going next,&mdash;Little Mitchell
was let out of his box to sit on the
seat by the lady’s side and eat his
dinner of roasted chestnuts and cooky.
They still had some of the big, sweet
Grandmother chestnuts, which they
had brought with them, and which
had all been nicely roasted, though
Little Mitchell was beginning to enjoy
a bit of raw chestnut by this time.
Still, he preferred the roasted ones,
and was able to pick them out from
a handful of both kinds.

[151]

When he had finished his chestnut,
he climbed up on the back of the seat,
and looked at an old lady, who fell in
love with him on the spot, and wanted
ever so much to hold him in her hand;
but do you think he would allow it?
Not he. He jumped up on his own lady’s
shoulder, and then sprang down into her
lap and hid in the folds of her dress.

He was still such a baby, you see!

It is not a very long ride from New
York to Hartford, as you know; and
when they got off the train it was
almost dark, and there was a friend
waiting for them, and soon they were
driving along over nice smooth streets
that did not jolt them at all. Then
they came to a driveway under big
trees, and to a house with the windows
all lighted up; and here they got out
of the carriage, and some more friends
came to the door to meet them. They
were in Hartford at last.





[152]



VIII

LITTLE MITCHELL GOES TO BOSTON

No doubt Little Mitchell was glad
enough to go to sleep that night in a
box that stayed still instead of waggling
about as it had done for so long
a time on the train.

It was a very hot night, although
rather late in the season for such warm
weather in Hartford. It was so warm
that the lady did not like to shut Little
Mitchell up in his box, even though it
had so many holes in it. So she left
the cover off, and just before going to
bed she looked in to see how he was
getting along.

Well, there he lay, on his back, with
his head resting on the edge of the
box and his arms up over his head, for[153]
all the world like a hot, tired, human
little baby.

He looked so cunning that the lady
called some of her friends to see
him; but by that time the light had
waked him up, and he stretched and
yawned and curled up after the usual
fashion of squirrels when they go to
sleep.

He was up bright and early next
morning, racing about the room, playing
hide-and-seek with the lady under
the bed-clothes, and having a grand
time.

The lady’s friend thought his little
box too close and small for him, and
gave him a nice large basket; but he
did not like to sleep in that at all, and
cried and scratched so when he was
put in to take a nap that the lady let
him out. And then what do you think
he did?

Why, he ran straight to his own[154]
little box and crept in and curled up
and went to sleep there.

But first he made a visit into the
big world. He went into the sitting-room,
where there were ever so many
tables and chairs for him to examine,
and, best of all, a wide couch with
many big soft pillows on it; and behind
these pillows he would hide, and jump
out at anybody’s fingers that came that
way,&mdash;for all the world like a playful
kitten.

He had a fine time playing with the
lady’s friends behind the pillows; and
finally he climbed up the nice soft coat
which her friend the gentleman who
lived there had on, and got into his
coat-pocket, and would not come out.
It was cosey and dark there, and he
liked it; and when anybody put in a
hand to take him out, he would scream
and nip at their fingers.

[155]


     
     Little Mitchell Plays with his Tail
“It was funny to see him hanging by his hind toes from his screen,
head downward, and play with his tail.” (Page 174)


[156]

And this, my dears, was not playing
at all,&mdash;it was real genuine naughtiness;
for when he played he was careful
never really to nip anybody,&mdash;he
only made believe, you know.

Well, the gentleman who lived there
let him stay in his pocket until he was
ready to go down town; then he called
the lady, and she put in her hand,
and Little Mitchell jumped at it and
growled, but when he found whose
hand it was he did not nip at all,&mdash;he
would no more hurt his lady than
he would hurt himself, no matter how
naughty he felt.

Well, the lady wanted to go away
for a little while; so she put him into
his box,&mdash;which was not an easy matter,
for as fast as she got him in one
side he squirmed out at the other,
and screamed, and was very naughty
indeed.

Finally she got him in, and fastened
the cover; but he acted so that she[157]
finally took him out and fastened him
into the basket.

When she got back, what do you
think? Little Mitchell was not in the
basket! He had gnawed a naughty
great hole right through the pretty
new basket, and had got out and was
hiding in the closet in the folds of a
dress that was hanging there.

The next time he was missing, somebody
found him among the papers in
the bottom of a scrap-basket, where he
sat, jumping at any strange fingers
that came his way, and nipping them,
and growling like a bad little bear,
until his lady came and fished him
out, screaming and squirming, but not
nipping.

Why do you suppose the gentle,
timid little Baby Mitchell had all at
once become such a naughty, self-willed
squirrel?

What shall I do with him? thought[158]
the lady. She was afraid he would
gnaw her friend’s furniture, and do all
sorts of mischievous things; so whenever
she was not there to take care of
him, she had to keep him shut up in
his little box, which was fast getting
to be too small for him.

One morning, as he sat on the
window-sill eating a nut, he had a
visit.

Along came a big reddish yellowish
squirrel, as large as a full-grown gray
one, but all fluffy,&mdash;a very handsome,
afraid-of-nobody sort of fellow,
who sat on the window-sill on the
other side of the wire screen, and
looked in at Little Mitchell.

How do you suppose Little Mitchell
received this pretty visitor? He just
dropped his nut with a squeal, and
scampered off as if the old cat were
after him, and went and hid in the
corner under the table.

[159]

You wouldn’t consider that very
good manners, would you? But then,
you see, he was really only a baby,
and had not yet learned how to behave.

There were a great many squirrels
about the lady’s friend’s place. The
grounds were large, with fine big trees
and wide lawns,&mdash;just the kind of
place squirrels like, for nobody can
shoot them there, and they know it.

So all about were squirrels,&mdash;little
red fellows, and big gray fellows, and
once in a while a big, tawny fluffy
fellow such as came to visit Little
Mitchell. Well, these squirrels played
a great deal, scampering about the
lawn and racing over the branches of
the trees, which made bridges for them
high up in the air. And oh, how they
would jump! It was enough to make
one dizzy to look at them.

But when the chestnuts that grew[160]
on the big trees back of the house
were ripe, then was the time of joy for
all these squirrels.

They had their own trouble in getting
their share of the nuts,&mdash;what
with the boys and all the other people
who wanted them,&mdash;but you may be
sure the squirrels got more than anybody
else.

There were so many squirrels hunting
for nuts!&mdash;and I am sorry to say
they were not all as honest as they
might have been.

The little red squirrels were the
quickest, and got the most nuts; but
they didn’t keep the most, because
there were those rascally gray squirrels,
which were nimble-witted if they were
not nimble-footed.

You know what the squirrels do
with their nuts. They hide them.
If they do not find a good place in a
hollow tree or somewhere, then they[161]
just dig a little hole and bury the nut
in the ground.

One day Little Mitchell’s lady was
sitting by a window that looked out on
the lawn at the back of the house, and
this is what she saw.

Along came a little red squirrel with
a nut in his mouth. He dug a hole in
the ground with his little paws, very
fast indeed. Then he tucked the nut
in, covered it up, and patted the dirt
and grass all down nice and smooth
over it.

This done, he scampered off and
got another nut and buried it in the
same way, and then another and
another, until he had planted quite a
space with his nuts. Then off he went,
and I am sure you could not have found
one of those nuts, he had hidden them
so cleverly, patting the earth and grass
down over them, so that the places
where they were did not show at all.

[162]

But if you could not have found
them, there was somebody else who
could.

The little red squirrel had no sooner
hidden his last nut and gone off, than
along came a big gray squirrel. Hop,
hop, he came, his nose to the ground.
Then he stopped, and began to dig
very fast with his hands, and&mdash;pop!&mdash;out
came one of the nuts the little
red squirrel had so carefully hidden!

Then the big gray mischief bounded
off to the other side of the lawn, where
he dug a hole and buried that nut!
His hole was deeper,&mdash;very likely too
deep for the little red fellow to get his
nut again, though I am not sure about
that. But, anyway, the gray squirrel
dug up all the poor little red fellow’s
nuts, and went off and hid them, one
by one, somewhere else.

The lady sat at the window and
watched this mischief. Then the gray[163]
squirrel sprang up a tree and went
tearing across the grove chattering
like mad.

No, not because he felt so proud of
what he had done, but because a blue-jay
was after him.

There were blue-jays in the grove,
too, and they were always tormenting
the squirrels, chasing them and screaming
at them as though they meant to
do all sorts of things to them.

Little Mitchell did not see these
things going on among his kinsfolk,
because he would have nothing to do
with any other squirrels. He would
not even look at them; and if one
came near the window where he was,
he always scampered off and hid.

One day the lady took Little
Mitchell down town with her. He
was in his little box, you know, because
she could not quite trust him to go
without it. She was afraid he would[164]
jump on somebody’s back, or do something
dreadful on the electric car; so
she shut him up in his box, and took
him along.

You couldn’t guess where they went!

It was to the photographer’s, to see
if he could take Little Mitchell’s picture.
The man said he would try.

They put Little Mitchell up on a
stand; but he wouldn’t stay. They
did everything they could think of,
but it was of no use,&mdash;he wouldn’t
keep still one second.

At last the lady sat down, and
tried to coax him to sit still with her;
but he wouldn’t do that, either. He
jumped up on her shoulder, and cocked
his tail up over his head,&mdash;it was
quite a tail by this time,&mdash;and peeped
out at the photographer, and at the
queer box with a glass eye that kept
pointing at him. The photographer
snapped, the way they do when they[165]
take a picture; but Little Mitchell was
too quick for him, and gave his tail a
flirt that spoiled the picture.

Then the photographer got all ready
again; but this time, just as he was
about to take the picture, Little
Mitchell jumped up on his lady’s head,&mdash;and
that, of course, wouldn’t do.

So they got all ready again, with
Little Mitchell sitting on his lady’s
knee; but again he flirted off, just in
time to spoil the picture.

Then he climbed up on his lady’s
arm, and the photographer whistled,
and Little Mitchell cocked up his tail
and his ears,&mdash;just as you see him in
the picture,&mdash;and listened, and in a
trice the man had pressed the bulb
and the restless Little Mitchell had
his picture taken after all. Whether
it was a success or not, you can decide
for yourself; for it is the frontispiece
to this very book.

[166]

When the lady was ready to go, she
could not find Little Mitchell. That
is because he was in the photographer’s
pocket. He had climbed in there to
hide away after the excitement of having
his picture taken; and at last the
photographer laughed, for he knew the
little rascal was there all the time, and
hauled him out, squirming and protesting,
and handed him to the lady.

In a few days she was ready to go on
to Boston; and she said she would be
glad to get there, so as to have a suitable
place for Little Mitchell, where he
would not have to be shut up so much
and yet could not get into mischief.

So they said good-bye to the Hartford
friends, and started for Boston,
Little Mitchell in his little box, which
he did not like at all.

They had their lunch on the train,
and Little Mitchell’s lunch was chestnuts
and chinkapins, which he ate[167]
sitting in the corner of the seat next
the window. But his lady had some
very dainty sandwiches, made of thin
slices of bread and butter with cream
cheese between.

Presently Little Mitchell smelled
the lady’s lunch, and it smelled better
than his own; so he threw down his
nut and ran up on her arm and tried
to take her sandwich away from her.

She said no, for she feared it might
not agree with him; but he said yes,
he would have some, and he snatched
and got a crumb which he crowded
into his mouth.

The lady set him down on the seat
and gave him his nut; but he threw it
down, and again snatched at her sandwich.
He nearly got it all this time,
but the lady caught it away just in
time. Then he began to scream and
struggle and fight for the sandwich,
until the people in the car began to[168]
laugh, and then the lady gave him a
little piece, and he sat up very straight,
eating cheese sandwich and looking as
solemn as an owl.

When they neared Boston, there
was a struggle to get him into his box;
for he had decided he wouldn’t go.
But this time he had to; and the
minute they got off the train the lady
drove to a bird-store and got a big
wire squirrel-cage to take home with
her.

As soon as she was in her own room,
she let Little Mitchell out. Such a
relief as it was to get him safely there!
And such a time as he had getting
acquainted with his new home! He
went all about the room,&mdash;over the
couch, on the table, all through the
bookcase, and even into the closet
where the lady hung her dresses.

[169]


     
     Little Mitchell Plays with a String
“Across the room and back again he would chase it.” (Page 190)


[170]

Then he helped her to unpack her
trunk and put everything away. Of
course the way he helped was to get
under her feet or her hands and be
in the way all the time as much as
possible.

Then the lady put him in the big
new cage, and shut the door. He
walked all around it, and then got into
the wheel. You know the wire wheel
that is always in a squirrel-cage? As
soon as he moved, of course the wheel
began to turn, and he began to run.
The faster he ran the faster it turned,
until he fairly flew.

At last his legs ached so he could
run no more, and he stopped, and then
the wonderful wheel stopped too; but
as soon as he took a step, it turned
again. Finally he jumped out; but in
a few minutes he went back and tried
it again. He thought it was splendid
fun; and so all in a minute, without
any teaching, Little Mitchell learned
how to use his play-wheel.

[171]

The lady stood close by the cage
and watched him, for she feared he
might be frightened by it, and if he
had seemed at all troubled she was
ready to put in her hand and stop the
wheel until he gradually learned how
to use it.





[172]



IX

LITTLE MITCHELL’S HAPPY DAYS

Little Mitchell was a very happy
squirrel in his Boston home. His
lady’s room had a large bay-window
in the end, that looked out over the
tops of the houses and away off up the
beautiful Charles River; and there was
a large platform, almost like a little
room, in the bay-window, and here, by
the side of the writing-table, stood his
cage. Its door was always open when
the lady was at home, and he had glorious
frolics all about the big room.

He climbed everywhere, but the
best fun was racing over the Japanese
screen. The lady had no tree for him
to climb, so she gave him the screen
to play with; and up and down it he[173]
would go, now this side, now that.
But he had the best time biting the
eyes out of the birds on the screen and
unravelling the embroidery.

Then he would sit up on top of the
screen and gnaw away at the wooden
frame. You see, when he was spoiling
the screen he was not spoiling anything
else; and as he liked the screen
better than anything else, his lady said
he might as well eat it up if he wanted
to, so she gave it to him.

It was very funny to see him go up
the side of the screen, which stood upright,
you know, like the wall of a
house. His claws were as sharp as a
cat’s, and he would hold on by his
front feet, and jump up with his hind
feet and get a new hold with his front
ones, and so on. He looked as though
he went hopping up the screen. And
it was funnier still when he came down
head-first.

[174]

But funniest of all was to see him
hang by his hind toes, head down, and
play with his tail! He was very fond
of playing with his tail, and when he
was on the floor he would often chase
it just as a kitten does. It was a fine
tail by this time, long and bushy; and
when he got excited he would fluff it
out until it looked like a real grown-up
squirrel’s tail.

But talking of tails, the most outrageously
funny thing Little Mitchell
ever did was to roll himself up into a
ball, with his tail hugged in his arms
and held between his teeth, then go
over and over, like a ball, from one
end of the platform to the other.

The first time the lady saw him, she
was rather startled,&mdash;she could not
imagine for a moment what that queer
soft-looking ball was, rolling so fast
about the platform. How she did laugh
when she saw that it was only Little[175]
Mitchell amusing himself! She had
never seen a squirrel or anything else
act like that before.

He was so funny playing about the
room, hanging by his toes from the
screen and rolling around like a ball,
that the lady could do nothing but
watch him when he was out of the
cage. She said he wasted all her time;
and he certainly did waste a great deal
of it.

The first thing in the morning, he
had to be fed and given a drink of fresh
water. He ate all sorts of nuts now,
but he would not crack the hard ones
himself. The lady used to bring home
any nice new nuts that she saw when
she was out, and Little Mitchell was
always on hand to open her parcels.
He enjoyed opening them as much as
you do when your mother comes home
from shopping. If he found nuts, he
would get into the bag and paw them[176]
all over, and at last run off with one.
If there were no nuts, he would sniff
at everything, and then go off, though
sometimes he found something he liked
to play with in the parcels.

When he was hungry, he insisted
on sitting upon the lady’s knee to
eat his nuts. Of course he could sit
up as well as anybody now, and hold
the nut in his funny little hands.
Some people would say paws; but if a
squirrel has not hands, then nobody
has. Just watch one take a nut and
turn it over and over with those hands,
and finally hold it firmly between those
ridiculous little nubbins that are his
thumbs, while he gnaws it. And then
watch him comb his tail with his
fingers, and wash his face with his
hands, and catch your watch-chain
when you dangle it in front of him.
Only, you see, he always uses both
hands at once. At least Little Mitchell[177]
did, for the lady never saw him take
anything in one hand alone. And he
did not pick up things with his hands,&mdash;he
picked up his nuts with his
mouth, and then took them in his
hands.

Didn’t he crack any of his nuts himself?
Oh yes, indeed, he cracked the
almonds and beech-nuts, and such soft-shelled
ones, as cleverly as you could
have done it yourself. But when it
came to hickory nuts and filberts, he
wouldn’t even try to crack them; he
would go and poke them into his lady’s
hand for her to crack, or else he would
hide them away.

He knew perfectly well, when she
got out the little hammer, that she was
going to crack his nuts,&mdash;and a hard
time she had not to crack his nose too,
for he insisted upon poking it under
the hammer, to see how the nuts were
getting on, I suppose.

[178]

Peanuts? Oh, he wouldn’t touch a
peanut,&mdash;not if he were ever so hungry.
He wouldn’t open one, and he
wouldn’t eat it if the lady opened it for
him. No,&mdash;he wouldn’t look at peanuts.
But he would eat beech-nuts until
you wondered where in the world he
put them all. And pecan nuts he liked
almost as well, only of course the lady
had to crack them for him.

He knew a good nut from a bad one,
too, before opening it. You could be
very sure that if he threw down a beech-nut
or an almond without trying to
open it, there was nothing fit to eat
inside. How he knew, I cannot tell;
but the rascal did know. I suppose it
was some of that squirrel wisdom that
kept coming to him as he grew older.

He used to drink from a tumbler in
those days; but he would not take it
between his lips, as he used to take the
spoon. He would stand up, holding on[179]
to the edge with his hands, and then
drink, making a great noise while doing
it. It was just the way children sometimes
drink when they are naughty;
but he was not naughty,&mdash;he didn’t
know any better, and it was all so cunning
his lady did not try to teach him.

She made up her mind, though, that
she would teach him a great many
things, he was so gentle and affectionate
and intelligent.

But he was something of a nuisance
about wasting her time. For one
thing, she had to brush his coat every
morning; and he would sit quite still
to have his head and ears brushed.
He would turn his head first one side,
then the other, so that his ears could
be brushed all around and back of
them, inside and out. But as soon
as his ears were washed, he thought
that was enough, and that it was time
for some fun; so he would catch hold[180]
of the brush and bite it, and kick at it
with his hind feet like a kitten playing,
and when the lady scolded him he
would sit still for about a second, then
he would snatch at the brush again, or
maybe suddenly fly off from her knee
and across the room. But she always
brought him back, and made him stay
until his fur was nicely brushed from
the tip of his nose to the tip of his
tail.

The tail was the hardest to fix. How
he would act when she got to his tail!
He knew it was time for some fun then,
and he would jerk the brush out of his
lady’s hand, and run away with it in his
mouth, and when she caught him and
took it away he would catch hold of his
tail and begin to comb it very fast himself
with his hands and his front teeth.

[181]


     
     Little Mitchell Sits in his Chair
“He sat in the doll’s chair before the little table, and ate his supper.” (Page 192)


[182]

Did he ever get over crying when
his mouth was wiped? Oh no, after
every drink of water he screamed in
the same naughty way if the lady
wiped his mouth. He much preferred
springing upon her and wiping it very
hard on the front of her dress. I suppose
he thought laces and ribbons
were made for squirrels to wipe their
faces on!

But he did love his lady. He did
not want to be away from her a moment.
Sometimes, when he ran across
the front of her waist to get to her
shoulder, she would drop a little kiss
on his furry coat as he passed. Then
what would he do? Run on without
noticing it? Oh no; he would stop
for just the fraction of a second, and
give one soft touch of his little velvety
tongue to her cheek, and then
race on again.

Sometimes he would lick her hands
like a little dog; and if she was busy,
he couldn’t possibly let her alone. If
she was writing, he would take hold[183]
of the pen and shake it, and bite at her
fingers, and turn somersaults in her
lap, and caper so she couldn’t do a
thing but stop and play with him, as
though he were a little monkey.

He liked to have her tousle him
about, as you do a kitten, upside
down, and tickling his little white neck
and chest with her fingers; and he
would make believe bite, and really
scratch just like a kitten. You see,
his little claws were as sharp as any
cat’s claws; and though he did not
mean to hurt her at all, he scratched
her hands all over until they were a
sight to see. Then she had to stop
playing that way, and instead she took
a long lead-pencil, and he would bite
at that and catch it in all four of his
feet, and hang from it like a sloth,
back down, and she would swing him
back and forth, as though he were a
hammock suspended from the ends of[184]
the pencil. He thought that was great
fun, and so did the lady.

As to sewing, she couldn’t do a bit
of it if he was out of his cage, for he
insisted upon helping, and caught hold
of the thread and tangled it all up. It
was such fun to see the lady’s hands
go back and forth, that he would
jump at them, and she was afraid that
she would stick the needle into his
nose or his eye. With the scissors it
was even worse; she couldn’t so much
as snip a thread without running the
risk of clipping something off him,&mdash;one
of his feet, or his nose, or the end
of his tail. He seemed to be all over
everything at once.

Of course she could have shut him
up in his cage, but she didn’t like to do
that, it made him so unhappy. He
would shake the cage door, and bite at
it, and do everything he could think
of to coax her to let him out.

[185]

Of course he wasn’t bothering her
every minute, though when he was not
playing with her she had to keep sharp
watch of him, for she never knew what
he might do next, excepting when he
was taking a sun-bath on the platform.
For when the sun flooded the big
windows, nice and warm, he would
flatten himself out on the floor, and
stretch first one leg, then another,
and finally he would open his mouth
and yawn, and show his four front
teeth, two above and two below, that
looked very long and sharp.

For that is the way the squirrel-folk
have their teeth,&mdash;two long, sharp
ones in the front of the upper jaw, and
two opposite them in the front of the
lower jaw. These teeth are like little
chisels, and it is with them they gnaw
wood so easily. Not that they have
only four teeth,&mdash;they have others,
away back in the mouth, that look[186]
something like our back teeth, and are
used for the same purpose&mdash;to chew
the food.

Well, when Little Mitchell went to
take a sun-bath, the lady was glad, you
may be sure; for then she knew he
would be out of mischief for a little
while. But it did not last long. He
was soon up and off to see what he
could do next.

He had soon collected a number of
things to play with. If the lady missed
any little thing, she was always sure
who had run away with it. His pet
plaything at this time was a little white
envelope that had had a visiting-card
in it. He fished the envelope out of
the scrap-basket and carried it about
for a long time, and then hid it away
under the corner of a sofa pillow. He
was always hiding his things, and the
lady was always finding them in the
queerest places. He used to put nuts[187]
in her slippers, and one day he even
tried to drop nuts down her back.
She never knew what she would find
in the sleeves of her dresses when she
took them out of the closet.

At last she collected all his playthings
that she could find,&mdash;the little
envelope, a big button, a hard cracker,
a piece of cooky, a small pine-cone,
three acorns, a worsted ball, and a
butternut,&mdash;and put them in a little
basket on the bureau. Very soon, you
may be sure, Little Mitchell found
them. The first thing his lady knew,
he was sitting on the very corner of the
bureau, with his cracker in his hands,
nibbling it. Then he took a taste of
the cooky; next he hauled out the little
envelope, and had a joyous time hauling
everything out of the basket.

What do you think he did next?

To the lady’s great astonishment, he
put them all back again!

[188]

He took the greatest fancy to the
little basket; and ever after, when he
took his things out of it, he put at
least part of them back again. He
seemed to think they were safely
hidden there.

He had such a hard time hiding
things! All his extra nuts he wished
to bury; for that is the way with the
squirrel-folk, you know, and though
Little Mitchell had never seen a squirrel
bury anything, he could not get
over wanting to do it. His favorite
place, next to the folds of the lady’s
dress, was the deer-skin that lay on
the platform. It was a beautiful skin
from his own mountains, where the
deer still run wild.

But the hair on a deer is short and
stiff; so there was not much chance to
hide anything in it. Yet how Little
Mitchell did try! He would hold in
his mouth the nut to be buried, while
he dug very fast indeed with his hands,&mdash;that
is, he went through the motions
of digging, for of course he couldn’t
dig a hole in the deer-skin.

[189]


     
     Little Mitchell Listens to the Whistle
“He would climb up on the screen, and there he would stay, as still as
a mouse.” (Page 197)


[190]

When he had dug long enough, he
would poke the nut down under the
hair on the skin, and then pat it all
down nicely on top. Only when he
got through there was the nut in plain
sight! Poor little chap! He would
try again and again, and at last give
the nut a good patting, and scamper
off. He often succeeded in getting the
nuts out of sight under the hair; and
a funny skin it was to walk over then,
all hubbly with hard nuts!

Another trick was to hide the nuts
all over his lady as she sat reading, and
when she got up a perfect shower of
nuts would rattle out upon the floor.

You should have seen the little fellow
play with a ball tied to a string!&mdash;across
the room and back again,[191]
around and around he would chase it,
just like a kitten. But he was ever so
much quicker and funnier than a kitten,
and prettier, too, with that bushy
tail of his flirting and curving about.

You see how it was,&mdash;he had nobody
but his lady to play with, and
he just had to play; so he learned all
sorts of funny little tricks that squirrels
in the woods, who have each other to
chase and who have to put away their
winter stores, have no time for.

Do you know how he learned to sit
in the doll’s chair?

The lady got a little wooden chair
and table to give to a little girl; but
before she gave them away she thought
she would see if she couldn’t teach
Little Mitchell to sit in the chair. So
she let him get quite hungry one day;
then she put him in the chair with one
hand while she gave him a nice cracked
nut with the other.

[192]

He was so eager to eat his nut that
he never moved! She drew the table
up in front of him, with some nuts and
a little red apple lying on it, and Little
Mitchell sat there like a well-behaved
child and ate his supper. He soon
got used to it, and if he felt like it
he would sit still in the tiny rocking-chair
and eat his nuts; but sometimes
he would jump up and tip over the
chair, table, and everything else.

He liked apples. He liked to have
a whole one, so he could roll it around
and play with it. You should have
seen him try to hold it in his hands like
a nut! When he found he couldn’t,
he would crouch down close to it and
gnaw a hole in the skin. But don’t
imagine he would swallow the skin!
He wouldn’t, not a bit! He flung it
away, as he did the nut-shells, and ate
the soft pulp inside.

He did not often get a whole apple,[193]
because the lady did not like to have
the bits of skin thrown about the floor.
You see, he would go to work and peel
half the apple before he took a bite.
He seemed to do this for fun; but he
never picked up the little pieces of skin
he flung about.

But much as he liked apples, he
liked grapes better; and these he could
hold in his hands. He looked very
pretty, sitting up with his bushy tail
showing above his head and a big yellow
California grape in his hands.

LITTLE MITCHELL MAKES A MISTAKE

Little Mitchell did not allow anybody
to touch him except his lady;
and he would not eat for any one else.
He would not even make friends with
the other people in the house,&mdash;but
that may be because he did not see
enough of them.

One day the lady heard no sound
from him for a long time, and she began
to look around for him; but Little
Mitchell was gone! She looked all
about the room,&mdash;no Little Mitchell.
In his cage,&mdash;no Little Mitchell. In
the closet, where the dresses hung,&mdash;no
Mitchell. She shook the dresses to
see if he had not gone to hide in them
and fallen asleep,&mdash;no Little Mitchell.[195]
Then she called him,&mdash;not a sound.
Finally she went out into the hall and
looked for him, for the door was open,&mdash;but
still no Little Mitchell.

Then she went into the room of her
next neighbor, who was a newspaper
editor and not at home, but whose
door was open; and there, in the middle
of the floor, looking about him
to see what to go at first, sat Little
Mitchell!

The rascal! As soon as the lady
came he made a dive for the hall and
scampered home; for she had told him
he must not go near the open door,
and had scolded him so often for doing
it that he knew perfectly well he ought
not to do it.

Yes, indeed,&mdash;he knew when he
was scolded, and scolding was usually
enough; though once or twice the
lady had spatted him,&mdash;not hard, you
know, not hard at all; but it almost[196]
broke his heart, he was such a sensitive
little thing.

The first time it happened he had
done something very naughty, and he
knew it was naughty too. The lady
caught him up and cuffed him ever so
little; but she was dreadfully frightened
when the little fellow stiffened out as
though he were dead, and lay perfectly
still for ever so long. But he never did
the naughty thing again.

The only other time he got slapped
was when his lady’s friend put out her
hand to touch him. He was sitting
on his lady’s knee, and he deliberately
reached out and bit the visitor’s finger.
Yes, he really bit it so that a drop of
blood came.

That was naughty, and he knew it;
and his lady slapped him a little, and
said, “No, no, Mitchell!” very crossly,
and he jumped away, his tail all fluffy,
and ran as fast as he could and tucked[197]
his head up her sleeve as far as he
could get it.

Perhaps the reason why he went to
the editor’s room was because that was
where the singing came from, and he did
enjoy hearing anybody sing! When
the editor was at home, he used to sing
a great deal; and Little Mitchell would
climb up on the screen which stood in
front of the open door, and lean his
head away down, and cock his ear to
listen, and there he would stay as still
as a mouse as long as the editor sang
or whistled.

One day he really went visiting.
His lady took him to a friend’s house
one night just as they were finishing
dinner, and she was invited to have
some of the ice-cream.

She had Little Mitchell buttoned
up under her jacket; but as soon as
the ice-cream came along he put in an
appearance and wanted his share, which[198]
he ate very nicely out of a spoon, to
the amusement of all who saw him.

After dinner, when they were all
together in the sitting-room, one of
the young men&mdash;who was a Harvard
student, and knew more about many
other things than he did about squirrels&mdash;said
Little Mitchell did not really
know the lady, but would just as soon
go to anybody else if he were left
alone.

So all the family&mdash;eight or nine,
counting the visitors&mdash;formed a circle,
and the lady set Little Mitchell down
in the middle, and then quickly stepped
back behind him to a new place in the
circle.

Little Mitchell’s bushy tail jerked
nervously for a minute, and his bright
eyes looked wildly from one strange
face to another; then he gave a leap
and landed at his lady’s feet, and in
another second was up on her shoulder.

[199]

After that, no one denied that he
knew his lady, and liked her best of
all.

He had to take an airing once in a
while, and the way he went was to
ride in his own private carriage,&mdash;which
was nothing less than the inside
of his lady’s jacket. She would button
it all but the two top buttons, and
tuck him in, and away they would go
for a walk or a romp together.

Little Mitchell thought this great
fun, and usually gave no trouble.
Sometimes they walked along the
street, when Little Mitchell would
pop his head out and look about, but
if anybody came along he would pop
it back again.

Sometimes they went to the Public
Garden; and here he had many adventures.
One day his lady thought
she would let him climb a tree. So
she chose a little one, put him on one[200]
of the lower limbs, and then stepped
back. Little Mitchell looked about,
but did not climb; he took two or
three steps, then I suppose he decided
it was an awful thing to be left
there alone on a wild little tree in a
wild park that stood in a wild world
that he knew nothing about; so he
gave one tremendous jump and landed
on his lady’s shoulder, and scurried
down into his safe hiding-place under
her jacket, and peeped out at the terrible
tree and the strange world he
was so afraid of.

Then she put him on the grass, and
went on; but Little Mitchell went on
too, and in less time than it takes to
tell he had caught her and come flying
up again to his safe place in her
jacket.

Sometimes he would come out and
sit in her hand; but it seemed a very
dangerous world to a squirrel who had[201]
never been out of doors,&mdash;and so it
was, for did not a little girl come up
to look at him one day and suddenly
grab him in both hands? But how
quick she let go! He squealed his
loudest, and squirmed like an eel,
and no doubt would have bitten her,
only she was so frightened that she
dropped him on the grass. The lady
quickly stooped down with her hand
out, and he sprang upon it and ran up
her arm and hid in her jacket. No
little girls for him!

He liked to have the lady go to a
lonely part of the Public Garden, and
sit on a bench, and let him sit beside
her with a nice pecan nut that had
been cracked a little so that he could
open it by working at it awhile.

You see, he did not crack his own
nuts, because he did not know how.
It must be that mother squirrels start
the nuts for their young ones; but[202]
Little Mitchell’s lady did not know
that, only she saw nuts that the squirrels
had gnawed, and there were two
little holes in the sides opposite each
other. But Little Mitchell did not
gnaw the sides of the nut,&mdash;he always
tried to gnaw the end; and
you know it would take him forever
to get at the meat that way. So
finally the lady started his nuts with
a penknife in the right place, and
Little Mitchell would try very hard
to finish opening them; but he liked
much better to have his nuts cracked
with a hammer, so that he could peel
off pieces of the shell.

No doubt he would soon have
learned to open his nuts himself, and
do it very well, only something happened
that made this impossible. It
is strange he did not know how, he
knew so many other things the squirrel
folk know, but that they had never[203]
taught him. You remember he knew
how to clean himself and wash his
face in the funny squirrel way. And
he knew how to talk squirrel talk.
He had several sounds that meant
different things.

The funniest talking he ever did was
when he saw the dog in the backyard.
It was away down below him,
and not in his yard either, but in
another yard over the fence. It is
strange he should have noticed the
dog so far off; but he had good eyes,
had Little Mitchell,&mdash;and the way he
screamed and scolded when he saw the
dog! You never heard anything like
it,&mdash;unless you have been scolded
by a gray squirrel out in the woods
sometime!

He was sitting looking out of the
big window, when the little dog ran
across the yard. Up went Little
Mitchell’s hands across his breast, in[204]
the most comical manner, as though
he were pressing them over his fast-beating
heart. Then he stretched his
neck, and opened his mouth wide, and
screamed at the dog. The way he
screamed when his mouth was wiped
was nothing to this. How he did go
on!&mdash;just as the gray squirrels in the
woods do when they are very much
excited; and he had never heard a
squirrel do it in all his life.

There were gray squirrels on Boston
Common, where Little Mitchell sometimes
went to walk with the lady; but
he did not take the slightest interest
in them.

There are more squirrels on the
Common sometimes than others. The
winter Little Mitchell was in Boston
there were several of them living on
the Common, and they had nests in
some of the trees. Yes, they built
nests that looked like big clumsy[205]
bird’s-nests, and they went into them
to sleep and to keep warm.

One cold winter day, when Little
Mitchell’s lady was crossing the Common
early in the morning, and Little
Mitchell was not with her, a big gray
squirrel ran up to her and asked for a nut.
Of course he could not ask in people’s
talk, but he asked very plainly in squirrel
talk,&mdash;in their sign language. He
made no sound, but signed for nuts in
the prettiest way, running close up to
her, flatting out a little toward the
ground, and looking up into her face as
Little Mitchell looked when he was
coaxing for something. The lady had
no nuts with her; but she brought
some when she came that way again.
Then she found somebody else had
given him nuts, and he was sitting
on the ground eating them. Of course
this squirrel did not pass the winter in
a nest in the branches of a tree. Oh,[206]
no, he had a nice warm hiding-place
inside a big tree that had a hole in the
crotch so that he could get in.

Once there were a great many squirrels
on the Common, but one day there
were none. They had all gone off.
What had become of them? everybody
was asking. The policeman knew, for
he saw them go. It was very early in
the morning, and they went all together,
single file, across Cambridge
bridge. They were on the bridge railing,
one old fellow leading the way.
Perhaps there were getting to be too
many of them to be comfortable on the
Common. Perhaps they were tired of
city life. Anyway, the policeman saw
them go, and that was the end of the
squirrels on the Common for some time.
At least, so I was told.

A good many city parks have gray
squirrels in them, but where else are
they so tame as in the park at[207]
Richmond, Virginia? Little Mitchell’s
lady was there one day, before she
had found Little Mitchell, and the
squirrels were so tame they came
right up and ate out of her hand;
and when she stooped down to speak
to one, another little fellow raced right
up her back,&mdash;which rather startled
her, because she was not used to
squirrels then.

Well, Little Mitchell grew fast, and
promised to become a very large and
handsome squirrel, when he made a
dreadful mistake one day and licked
the heads of the matches. He got
into the match-box somehow,&mdash;he
was always opening boxes to see what
was in them,&mdash;and he liked the taste
of the matches, never suspecting what
sad results would follow.

The lady looked about at last to see
what he was up to,&mdash;for if he was
quiet more than a minute at a time[208]
it meant mischief. How she jumped
when she saw what he was doing!
But it was too late, and little Mitchell
tumbled over then and there, and the
lady thought he was dead; but he
was not.

He appeared to get over it and be
perfectly well again; and the lady&mdash;who
did not know as much about
phosphorus poisoning then as she was
soon to learn&mdash;thought nothing was
to come of it. You see, phosphorus
is the stuff on the ends of matches
that makes them light; and it is poison,&mdash;and
a mean, horrible poison
too.

Little Mitchell played about as
usual for a few days, rolling like a ball
on the platform, racing over the screen,
and tormenting the lady when she
wanted to work. Then one morning
he was frightfully sick and he stayed
sick all day. He sat hunched up on[209]
the couch, making queer, mournful
little noises, and eating nothing.

He could not even bear the gentle
touch of the lady’s hand, and screamed
if she came near him, he was so afraid
she would touch him. So she left
him to himself, and went to the doctor
and asked about it, and the doctor
told her what to do. There was not
very much she could do then, but
keep him warm and wait.

For two or three days Little Mitchell
was a very sick squirrel; but then he
began to get better again, and soon
was running about almost as well as
ever,&mdash;but not quite. He seemed
weak, and could not use his hind legs
as well as usual. But he was still
very cunning and lively, and as affectionate
as ever.

While he was sick, the lady let him
sleep under the corner of her travelling
rug instead of in his cage; and[210]
when he got better he still wanted to
sleep in the rug. He would creep in
to take a nap in the daytime, and at
night he teased so to stay that the lady
yielded at last, and fixed him a bed on
the floor, at the head of her own couch.
She doubled a towel in between two
folds of the rug, for sheets, as it were;
but Little Mitchell did not like the
towel, and would creep in on top of it
or under it. Then it was pinned down
so he had to go into it; and at last
he got used to it, and always went in
right, whether it was pinned or not.

After a few days the lady woke up
one night and thought she heard him
making queer noises. She got a light,
and, sure enough, there he was, as sick
as ever. But he got over it again, and
went on for a long time about as usual,
though his hind legs seemed weaker
than before. He could scarcely climb
to the top of his screen, and never raced[211]
over it and hung by his toes, as he had
liked to do.

He had to take medicine; but he
would not touch his drinking water if
the medicine was put in that, so the
lady got it in the form of little sugar
pills. He was very fond of sugar, you
know, though he was not allowed to
eat much candy; and he liked those
little pills, and was always ready to eat
one whenever it was given him.

He liked his flaxseeds, too, at first,
and would crunch them up, one at a
time, between his sharp little teeth; but
he soon got tired of them, and would
not eat them unless the lady made him.
The way she managed was to pour
some of the seeds in the palm of her
hand, and give them to him early in
the morning. If he would not eat
them, she waited, and after a while
offered them again; and not a bit of
breakfast would he get until he had[212]
eaten his flaxseeds. He soon learned
that he must eat them, and it was funny
to see him try to get rid of them by
pawing them out of the lady’s hand.
He would paw them all out into her
lap; but she would gather them up
again, when he would stick in his nose
very hard, so as to spatter half of them
out. He would munch two or three,
looking at her out of his bright eyes;
then he would nose around in them
again, until he had spilled them all out
into her lap. But again she would
gather them up, and so they would
keep on until he had eaten what was
necessary for him.





[213]



XI

LITTLE MITCHELL GOES TO SLEEP

One day Little Mitchell’s lady said
good-bye to him, and went away
to stay two or three days. He had
been well now for more than a week,
so that she did not feel troubled at
leaving him.

A friend promised to attend to him
in her absence; but this was easier
said than done. She opened the cage,
thinking he would come and sit in her
lap as he did in his lady’s.

Sit in her lap? Not a bit of it!
Nor would he take any nuts from her,
nor have anything to do with her. As
soon as he got out of the cage, off he
scampered, and she could not catch
him. So she took a book and sat[214]
still, hoping he would return to his
cage, in which she had laid some nuts.

Presently she heard a match snap,
and looking quickly up, saw Little
Mitchell drop a lighted match and
scamper off.

Some one had dropped a match on
the floor, and poor Little Mitchell had
found it. This time he gnawed it and
set it on fire, which made him quickly
drop it, and thus he did not get so
much of the poison as before, though
he burned the whiskers all off the side
of his face again. It was the same
side they were burned off before, but
they had grown out since then.

He went into his cage at last; but
he ate scarcely anything, and was a
very unhappy little fellow until his
lady came back to him. You may
be sure he was glad to see her! She
let him out the minute she got into
the room, and he climbed up and[215]
cuddled close to her face, and then
ran around and around her,&mdash;for
though it was hard for him to climb
the stiff screen, he could climb up on
his lady’s dress quite easily. He hung
about her as though he could not bear
to leave her for a minute, and kept
this up as long as she stayed in the
room.

But the extra taste of phosphorus
soon had its effect, and next day the
poor little fellow was sick again. But
he recovered as before.

Then he had another misfortune.
He got his tail skinned.

His lady had to be gone all one
day, so she left him in his cage as she
always did when she went out. When
she got back, there was poor Little
Mitchell with the cotton in his nest
wrapped all tight about his tail. He
had struggled to get free until his tail
was all twisted and torn. Oh, but he[216]
was glad to see the lady! She did
not even stop to take off her things
before she pulled the cotton out of the
nest, and took Little Mitchell out and
carefully untwisted the poor tail, from
which the skin was off for a third of
its length. You can imagine he was
a queer-looking fellow then! But
the lady took good care of him, and
bathed the tail every day, and put oil
on it to make the hair grow. It was a
pretty sad-looking tail, and she feared
the hair never would grow on it again;
but it did.

After a while rows of short hairs began
to come out all along the bare
spot; and then his tail looked funny
enough. Do you remember how the
little scouring rush that grows in
swampy places looks? Do you remember
the rings of stiff little bristles
all down it? Well, Little Mitchell’s
tail reminded his lady of the scouring[217]
rush. The hairs came out in rings,
a ring of them at each joint; but they
grew ever so fast, and in the end that
part of the tail was almost the handsomest
of all!

But what a lot of trouble it made for
both of them,&mdash;that tail! It had to
be bathed often,&mdash;and Little Mitchell
did hate so to have it put into the
water. At first, as soon as the water
touched it he would squirm loose and
run off, and the lady would catch
him, and, holding him before her face,
would talk to him and tell him all
about it, and that he must be good
and let her wash it. And then&mdash;will
you believe it?&mdash;Little Mitchell
would be good, and let her finish washing
him in the warm soapy water.

Yes, he had a bath all over once in a
while with nice warm water. He didn’t
like it very well, though the lady was
ever so careful not to get the soap in[218]
his eyes. But what came after the
bath,&mdash;the rubbing, and the sitting on
his lady’s knee in the warm sun until
he was perfectly dry,&mdash;he liked very
much indeed. And then, when his
coat changed, the bath and the rubbing
stopped that dreadful itching.

His baby coat was very soft and fine
and of the same gray color all over,
excepting of course on the under side of
his body, and there it was white. But
when he was three or four months old,
he began to change in many curious
ways. For one thing, there came a
queer growth under his coat that surprised
the lady very much. When she
brushed him, instead of a dainty white
skin under his fur he seemed covered
with a sort of gray felt. Pretty soon
this felt got to be a coat of long close
hair, that was very pretty, and quite different
in coloring from the baby coat,
which soon began to fall out. That is[219]
why he itched so; the loose hairs tickled
him, and he was all the time biting and
scratching himself, so that it was almost
impossible for the lady to brush him,
he wriggled about so.

His new coat was light gray on the
sides, with a dark stripe down the
middle of the back; and there was such
a pretty reddish brown stripe between
his gray sides and the pure white on
the under side of his body. At the
same time, he got a reddish stripe on
each side of his face, and his face
changed its shape, or else the new
markings made it look changed. You
see now what was happening,&mdash;Little
Mitchell was no longer a baby.
He was fast getting to be a handsome
grown-up squirrel, with all the stripes
and markings of one. His face seemed
to shorten up and change in expression,&mdash;just
as people change when they
grow out of childhood into grown-up[220]
men and women. Only their faces
grow longer instead of shorter.

It was very pretty to watch these
changes come over Little Mitchell; but
one thing troubled his lady,&mdash;as time
went on he did not get well. He
would seem pretty well for a long time,
but the poor little hind legs got weaker
and weaker. The lady comforted him
by rubbing them,&mdash;they seemed so
stiff, just as though he were a little old
man with the rheumatism. He liked
the rubbing every morning. The lady
would gently knead the muscles of his
back, and then of his hind legs, one
after the other. When she got to the
leg, he would stick it out straight in
her hand, it felt so good to have it
rubbed.

When she had finished and put him
down, he would look up at her and
nod his head,&mdash;which was his way of
coaxing her to rub him some more.

[221]

The rubbing seemed to help the
little legs, but it did not give them
strength; and soon Little Mitchell
could not climb his screen at all.
He could climb up the table-cover,
though, to the table, where he loved
to poke around among the books and
papers,&mdash;and I am sorry to say he
would sometimes gnaw at a book-cover
unless he were watched.

He could climb up the lady’s dress,
too, quite easily, and get into her lap,
where he loved to lie stretched out.
And he could climb up the dresses
that hung in the closet. The best
thing there was the woolly wrapper;
he used to climb up to the hook it
hung on, and sit there, and after a
while slip into the top of the sleeve
and take a nap.

One day his lady hung the cuff of
the sleeve on another hook, and so
made a fine hammock for him to creep[222]
into. He lay there a long while, having
the most beautiful time,&mdash;and
what do you suppose he was doing?
He was pulling the fuzz all off the
inside of the sleeve! He did not gnaw
the cloth at all,&mdash;he just amused himself
pulling off the fuzz and rolling it
into balls.

As Little Mitchell became weaker,
he would often lie in his little hammock
in the closet half a day at a
time. And when, finally, he got to
be too weak to climb even the woolly
wrapper, the lady would lift him up
and put him into the sleeve, and he
would stay there until he wanted to
come out, when he would get up on
the hook from which the wrapper
hung, and wait for the lady to take
him down. He was very much afraid
of falling; so he did not try to climb
much. He did fall once in a while,
and it seemed to hurt him dreadfully.

[223]

But though he had become so weak,
he was not at all stupid. Even in his
nest in the dark sleeve, he knew when
the lady came into the closet. I suppose
it was that wonderful nose of
his that told him. It did not disturb
him to have her come, even when she
brushed against him. It did not seem
even to wake him up.

But one day a friend of the lady
went into the big closet for something,
and passed Little Mitchell as
he lay asleep in his hammock. She
did not touch him at all; but his
quick little nose must have smelled
a stranger, and how he did growl
and scold at her! She did not know
what it was at first, and jumped out
of the closet as though a bear had
been in there.

Little Mitchell seldom sat in his
little chair in those days; but the
day when Margaret and George and[224]
the baby came to see him, the lady
set him in his chair before his table
and gave him a nut.

You should have seen the children,&mdash;how
pleased they were! George
had the jolliest laugh you ever heard;
and he was the jolliest boy, anyway.
But he was careful about laughing
out loud, for fear of scaring Little
Mitchell; and Margaret was careful
too. Even the baby was used to
playing with the kitten without hurting
it; so that Little Mitchell was
perfectly safe with those dear little
children, if he had only known
it. But he didn’t know it,&mdash;and
you remember how he felt about
children.

Now, what do you think he did?
He ate his nut as fast as he could, and
then he tumbled out of his chair and
went off to bed! Yes, he scrambled
down into his own corner, and crept[225]
into his bed&mdash;without a good-bye
look at his pretty visitors.

As time passed, Little Mitchell grew
still weaker. The lady again had to
be away for a day or two, but this time
she would not leave him in his cage.
She fixed his corner like a little room,&mdash;the
screen, which he could no longer
climb, at one end, and the wall opposite
it. The edge of the platform, upon
which he could no longer get without
help, made the third wall, and a box
the fourth. In the end of his little
room opposite his bed the lady put a
little dish of water, some cracked nuts,
and a bunch of grapes.

When she returned from her visit,
she went right away to see how Little
Mitchell was; and what do you think?
When she touched the rug, which
you remember was his bed, something
like a little bear inside growled at
her!

[226]

It was funny to hear Little Mitchell
growl. It was like a very mite of a
bear; but the lady was not afraid of
such bears, and boldly put her hand
right into its den, when the wild bear
inside gently licked her finger and was
as glad as could be to see her.

She took him out and shook out the
rug, for he had carried his nuts inside,
but his grapes he had eaten outside
like a nice, neat little bear.

He got so at last that he would not
eat unless he sat in his lady’s lap. He
could not sit up unless she put her
hand against his back and helped him.
He would sit in her lap and look up in
her face while he ate his nuts and
grapes.

When he wanted to go to her he
would get as close as he could and nod
at her to take him. When he wanted
anything, he would nod his head at his
lady, which was his way of saying[227]
“Please do it for me,” and she generally
understood what he wanted and
did it for him.

As soon as he stopped climbing, his
toe-nails grew very long and curved,
and he had not strength to pull them
out of the couch-cover or the blanket-wrapper
or his lady’s dress, and she
would have to help him. Sometimes
he would try to go from the couch to
the floor, and his toes would catch,
and there he would hang until the
lady saw him and jumped to help him
get loose.

One day she cut the tips off those
troublesome nails. Her friends said it
would spoil him; but she tried it, and
he was very comfortable until they
grew again, when she again very
carefully cut off the sharp curved
points, and kept them short enough
to be out of his way.

Sometimes when he was on the floor[228]
and wanted to get into her lap, he
would stand in front of her and nod
his head, when she would reach out her
foot and he would clamber upon it.
Then she would raise her foot, and
he would walk along up to her knee.
When he wanted to get down from
her lap, he would reach down with his
hands, and she would raise her foot
until he could walk down to it without
falling; then she would lower him to
the floor.

If he wanted to go from one place
to another, he just told his lady,&mdash;by
nodding, you know,&mdash;and she would
put out her hand to him. He would
get upon it and keep still until she
had carried him to the right place.
You see, they had got to be such
friends they understood each other
very well.

Sometimes he would slip when trying
to get down from the platform, or[229]
from a chair where the lady had put
him. One day he slipped and caught
by the edge of the platform, but had
not strength to pull himself up again.
The lady did not see him until his
strength was about gone, and he was
letting go, and about to get a fall that
would hurt his poor little crippled
body; so she said, “Mitchell, hold fast
a minute more; hold fast, I’m coming,”
and put down her work and hurried to
him. As she spoke, she saw him tighten
up for another effort, and he held until
she got to him.

At last there came a day when the
poor little fellow could not eat. The
paralysis that disabled his legs had
reached the muscles of swallowing;
and then his lady knew the end had
almost come. She sat on the platform
where she had so often sat while Little
Mitchell sunned himself on her knee,
and took him gently in her hands.[230]
She put one little kiss between his
ears,&mdash;and maybe there were tears
in her eyes. Thus did Little Mitchell
end his days.

It is true, he was nothing but a
squirrel; but living as he did with
human beings, developing his intelligence,
suffering, and learning love
and patience, he seemed very near
the human life with which his own
life was spent.

THE SPINNER FAMILY

By ALICE JEAN PATTERSON

With many illustrations by Bruce Horsfall. Price, $1.00 net


     
     “You see
what a beauty
she is.”


ALL wide-awake young people who are attracted by the living things
about them will find Miss Patterson’s simple story very delightful. It
will open to them a new and fascinating avenue of investigation. The
structure and habits of the spiders are all but unknown to most of us, and
we are apt to regard them as objects to be avoided. But her book makes
an apparently grewsome subject inviting, and will draw them into a new
field of much interest. Bruce Horsfall, that sympathetic artist of nature,
has drawn a frontispiece in color, and very many pictures for the text,
which reveal some of the wonders of the spider’s life, and make the narrative
doubly interesting. The whole is within the comprehension of a child,
and yet is so accurate that it may be trusted to state nothing which the facts
of science do not warrant.

BY MISS MORLEY



LIFE AND LOVE

By Margaret Warner Morley. With profuse illustrations
by the Author. Price, $1.25.

MARGARET WARNER MORLEY has written in “Life and Love” a
book which should be placed in the hands of every young man and
woman. It is a fearless yet clean-minded study of the development of life
and the relations thereof from the protoplasm to mankind. The work is
logical, instructive, impressive. It should result in the innocence of
knowledge, which is better than the innocence of ignorance. It is a pleasure
to see a woman handling so delicate a topic so well. Miss Morley deserves
thanks for doing it so impeccably. Even a prude can find nothing to
carp at in the valuable little volume.&mdash;Boston Journal.


A SONG OF LIFE

By Margaret Warner Morley. With profuse illustrations
by the Author and by Robert Forsyth. Price,
$1.25.

A MOST charmingly instructive book; and so beautifully explained is
the great subject of life that the little ones for whom it is intended
cannot but receive great benefit, while the older ones will also learn much.
Something of flower life, something of fish life, of frogs and of birds, and a
chapter on human life, form the subjects of this book, all told in the graceful
manner of a womanly woman whose love for Nature has given her a
keener insight into Nature’s secrets and a greater ability to impart those
secrets to others with the ease of face-to-face talks than is vouchsafed to
many people.&mdash;Boston Times.


THE HONEY MAKERS

By Margaret Warner Morley. With many illustrations
by the Author. Price, $1.25.

UNLIKE Miss Morley’s other works, this book is intended for older
readers. The first part of the book is devoted to the scientific exposition
of the bee’s structure, habits, etc., and it is surprising how much interest
and humor the author has managed to infuse into the subject. The
second part performs an original and valuable service to literature. To the
bees more than to any other portion of the animal kingdom has attention
been devoted by poets and thinkers seeking inspiration, and from this
wealth of allusion and anecdote Miss Morley has culled the choicest and
most striking parts.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
