<h2><a name="LANGDON_MITCHELL" id="LANGDON_MITCHELL"></a>LANGDON MITCHELL</h2>

<p class="center">(Born Philadelphia, Pa., February 17, 1862)</p>


<p>The performance of "The New York Idea" at the Lyric
Theatre, New York, on November 19, 1906, was one of the rare,
distinguished events in the American Theatre. It revealed the
fact that at last an American playwright had written a drama
comparable with the very best European models, scintillating
with clear, cold brilliancy, whose dialogue carried with it an
exceptional literary style. It was a play that showed a vitality
which will serve to keep it alive for many generations, which will
make it welcome, however often it is revived; for there is a universal
import to its satire which raises it above the local, social
condition it purports to portray. And though there is nothing
of an ideal character about its situations, though it seems to be
all head, with a minimum of apparent heart, it none the less is
universal in the sense that Restoration comedy is universal. It
presents a type of vulgarity, of sporting spirit, that is common in
every generation, whether in the time of Congreve and Wycherley,
whether in the period of Sheridan or Oscar Wilde. Its wit is
not dependent on local colour, though ostensibly it is written
about New York. On its first presentment, it challenged good
writing on the part of the critics. High Comedy always does
that&mdash;tickles the brain and stimulates it, drives it at a pace not
usually to be had in the theatre. Is it comedy or is it farce, the
critics queried? Is Mr. Mitchell sincere, and does he flay the evil
he so photographically portrays? Does he treat the sacred subject
of matrimony too flippantly? And should the play, in order
to be effective, have a moral tag, or should it be, what on the
surface it appears to be, a series of realistic scenes about people
whom one cannot admire and does not want to know intimately?
Some of the writers found the picture not to their liking&mdash;that is
the effect good satire sometimes has when it strikes home. Yet
when Grace George revived "The New York Idea" in a spirit so
different from Mrs. Fiske's, nine years after, on September 28,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>1915, at the Playhouse, New York, the <i>Times</i> was bound to make
the following confession: "A vast array of American authors
have turned out plays innumerable, but not one of them has
quite matched in sparkling gayety and wit this work of Langdon
Mitchell's. And the passing years have left its satire still
pointed. They have not dimmed its polish nor so much as
scratched its smart veneer."</p>

<p>The play was written expressly for Mrs. Fiske. Its hard,
sharp interplay of humour was knowingly cut to suit her hard,
sharp method of acting. Her interpretation was a triumph of
head over heart. Grace George tried to read into <i>Cynthia
Karslake</i> an element of romance which is suggested in the text,
but which was somewhat over-sentimentalized by her soft portrayal.
There is some element of relationship between "The New
York Idea" and Henry Arthur Jones' "Mary Goes First;" there
is the same free air of sporting life, so graphically set forth in
"Lord and Lady Algy." But the American play is greater than
these because of its impersonal strain.</p>

<p>In a letter to the present Editor, Mr. Mitchell has broken
silence regarding the writing of "The New York Idea." Never
before has he tried to analyze its evolution. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The play was written for Mrs. Fiske. The choice of subject was
mine. I demanded complete freedom in the treatment, and my most
wise manager, Mr. Harrison Grey Fiske, accorded this. The play
was produced and played as written, with the exception of one or two
short scenes, which were not acceptable to Mrs. Fiske; that is, she
felt, or would have felt, somewhat strained or unnatural in these
scenes. Accordingly, I cut them out, or rather rewrote them. The
temperament of the race-horse has to be considered&mdash;much more,
that of the 'star'.</p>

<p>When I was writing the play, I had really no idea of satirizing
divorce or a law or anything specially temperamental or local. What
I wanted to satirize was a certain extreme frivolity in the American
spirit and in our American life&mdash;frivolity in the deep sense&mdash;not just
a girl's frivolity, but that profound, sterile, amazing frivolity which
one observes and meets in our churches, in political life, in literature,
in music; in short, in every department of American thought, feeling
and action. The old-fashioned, high-bred family in "The New York
Idea" are solemnly frivolous, and the fast, light-minded, highly intelligent
hero and heroine are frivolous in their own delightful way&mdash;frivolity,
of course, to be used for tragedy or comedy. Our frivolity
is, I feel, on the edge of the tragic. Indeed, I think it entirely tragic,
and there are lines, comedy lines, in "The New York Idea," that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>indicate this aspect of the thing.</p>

<p>Of course, there is more than merely satire or frivolity in the
play: there is the Englishman who appears to Americans to be
stupid on account of his manner, but who is frightfully intelligent;
and there are also the energy and life and vigor of the two men
characters. There is, too, throughout the play, the conscious humour
of these two characters, and of the third woman, <i>Vida</i>. The
clergyman is really more frivolous often and far less conscious of his
frivolity&mdash;enough, that I rather thought one of the strongest things
about the play was the consciousness of their own humour, of the
three important characters.</p>

<p>The characters were selected from that especial class, or set,
in our Society, whose ancestors and traditions go back to colonial
times. They are not merely <i>society</i> characters, for, of course, people
in society may lack all traditions. I mention this merely because
my selection of characters from such a set of people gives the play a
certain mellowness and a certain air which it otherwise would not
have. If <i>Jack</i> and <i>Cynthia</i> were both completely self-made, or the
son and daughter of powerful, self-made people, their tone could
not be the same.</p>

<p>The piece was played in England as a farce; and it was given
without the permission of the author or American manager. It was
given for a considerable number of performances in Berlin, after
the Great War began. In the German translation it was called
"Jonathan's Daughter."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Our relations with Germany at the time
were strained on account of 'certain happenings', but, notwithstanding,
the play was extraordinarily well received.</p></div>

<p>When "The New York Idea" was first published by the Walter
Baker Co., of Boston, it carried as an introduction a notice of
the play written by William Archer, and originally published in
the London <i>Tribune</i> of May 27, 1907. This critique follows the
present foreword, as its use in the early edition represents Mr.
Mitchell's choice.</p>

<p>The writing of "The New York Idea" was not Mr. Mitchell's
first dramatic work for Mrs. Fiske. At the New York Fifth
Avenue Theatre, on September 12, 1899, she appeared in
"Becky Sharp," his successful version of Thackeray's "Vanity
Fair," which held the stage for some time, and was later revived
with considerable renewal of its former interest. Two years after,
rival versions were presented in London, one by David Balsillie
(Theatre Royal, Croydon, June 24, 1901) and the other by
Robert Hichens and Cosmo Gordon Lennox (Prince of Wales's
Theatre, August 27, 1901)&mdash;the latter play used during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
existence of the New Theatre (New York). Most of Mr.
Mitchell's attempts in play-writing have been in dramatization,
first of his father's "The Adventures of Fran&ccedil;ois," and later of
Thackeray's "Pendennis," Atlantic City, October 11, 1916. He
was born February 17, 1862, at Philadelphia, the son of Silas
Weir Mitchell, and received his education largely abroad. He
studied law at Harvard and Columbia, and was admitted to the
bar in 1882. He was married, in 1892, to Marion Lea, of London,
whose name was connected with the early introduction of Ibsen
to the English public; she was in the initial cast of "The New
York Idea," and to her the play is dedicated.</p>


<p class="center">
<span class="smcap"><b>Mr. William Archer's Notice of<br />
"The New York Idea."</b></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... This play, too, I was unable to see, but I have read
it with extraordinary interest. It is a social satire so largely
conceived and so vigorously executed that it might take an
honourable place in any dramatic literature. We have nothing
quite like it on the latter-day English stage. In tone and treatment
it reminds one of Mr. Carton; but it is far broader in conception
and richer in detail than "Lord and Lady Algy" or "Lady
Huntworth's Experiment." In France, it might perhaps be
compared to "La Famille Benoiton" or "Le Monde ou l'on
s'ennuie," or better, perhaps, to a more recent, but now almost
forgotten satire of the 'nineties, "Paris Fin-de-Si&egrave;cle."</p>

<p>I find it very hard to classify "The New York Idea" under any
of the established rubrics. It is rather too extravagant to rank
as a comedy; it is much too serious in its purport, too searching
in its character-delineation and too thoughtful in its wit, to be
treated as a mere farce. Its title&mdash;not, perhaps, a very happy
one&mdash;is explained in this saying of one of the characters: "Marry
for whim and leave the rest to the divorce court&mdash;that's the New
York idea of marriage." And again: "The modern American
marriage is like a wire fence&mdash;the woman's the wire&mdash;the posts
are the husbands. One&mdash;two&mdash;three! And if you cast your eye
over the future, you can count them, post after post, up hill, down
dale, all the way to Dakota."</p>

<p>Like all the plays, from Sardou's "Divor&ccedil;ons" onward, which
deal with a too facile system of divorce, this one shows a discontented
woman, who has broken up her home for a caprice, suffering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
agonies of jealousy when her ex-husband proposes to make use
of the freedom she has given him, and returning to him at last
with the admission that their divorce was at least "premature."
In this central conception there is nothing particularly original.
It is the wealth of humourous invention displayed in the details
both of character and situation that renders the play remarkable.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note, by the way, a return on Mr. Mitchell's
part to that convenient assumption of the Restoration and eighteenth
century comedy writers that any one in holy orders could
solemnize a legal marriage at any time or place, without the
slightest formality of banns, witnesses, registration or anything
of the sort. One gathers that in New York the entrance to and
the exit from the holy estate of matrimony are equally prompt
and easy; or that, as one of the characters puts it, "the church is
a regular quick-marriage counter."</p>

<p>I presume there is some exaggeration in this, and that a marriage
cannot actually be celebrated at midnight, over a champagne-and-lobster
supper, by a clergyman who happened to drop
in. But there can be no doubt that whatever the social merits or
demerits of the system, facility of divorce and remarriage is an
immense boon to the dramatist. It places within his reach an
inexhaustible store of situations and complications which are
barred to the English playwright, to whom divorce always means
an ugly and painful scandal. The moralist may insist that this
ought always to be the case; and indeed that is the implication
which Mr. Mitchell, as a moralist, conveys to us.</p>

<p>He sacrifices the system of divorce for every trivial flaw of
temper which prevails in the society he depicts; but he no doubt
realizes that his doctrine as a satirist is hostile to his interest as a
dramatist. Restrict the facilities of divorce and you at once
restrict the possibilities of matrimonial comedy. Marriage becomes
no longer a comic, but a tragic institution.</p>

<p>In order to keep his theme entirely on the comic plane, Mr.
Mitchell has given no children to either of the two couples whom
he puts through such a fantastic quadrille. Law or no law, the
separation of its parents is always a tragedy to the child; which
is not to say, of course, that their remaining together may not in
some cases be the more tragic of the two alternatives. Be this as
it may, Mr. Mitchell has eluded the issue.</p>

<p>Nor has he thereby falsified his problem, for his characters
belong to that class of society in which, as Mr. Dooley points out,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
the multiplication of automobiles is preferred to that of progeny.
But he has not omitted to hint at the problem of the children,
and, as it were, confess his deliberate avoidance of it. He does
so in a touch of exquisite irony. <i>John</i> and <i>Cynthia Karslake</i> are
a couple devoted, not to automobiles, but to horses. Even their
common passion for racing cannot keep them together; but their
divorce is so "premature," and leaves <i>John</i> so restless and dissatisfied,
that he actually neglects the cares of the stable. His
favourite mare, Cynthia K, falls ill, and when his trainer brings
him the news he receives it with shocking callousness. Then the
trainer meets <i>Cynthia</i> and complains to her of her ex-husband's
indifference. "Ah, ma'am," he says, "when husband and wife
splits, it's the horses that suffers." I know not where to look for
a speech of profounder ironic implication. More superficial, but
still a good specimen of Mr. Mitchell's wit, is <i>William Sudley's</i>
remark as to <i>John Karslake</i>: "Oh, yes, he comes of a very
respectable family, though I remember his father served a term
in the Senate."</p>

<p>Altogether "The New York Idea" is, from the intellectual
point of view, the most remarkable piece of work I have encountered
in America. It is probably too true to the details of
American life to have much success in England; but the situation
at the end of the third act could not fail to bring down the house
even here. It would take too long to describe it in detail. Suffice
it to say that just at the point where <i>Cynthia Karslake</i> dismisses
her second bridegroom, to return to her first, the choir assembled
for the marriage ceremony, mistaking a signal, bursts forth with
irresistibly ludicrous effect into "The Voice That Breathed O'er
Eden."<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span> <i>Living-room in the house of</i> <span class="smcap">Philip Phillimore</span>. <i>Five</i>
<span class="smcap">P. M.</span> <i>of an afternoon of May. The general air and appearance of
the room is that of an old-fashioned, decorous, comfortable interior.
There are no electric lights and no electric bells. Two bell ropes
as in old-fashioned houses. The room is in dark tones inclining
to sombre and of old-fashioned elegance.</i></p>

<p><i>Seated in the room are</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Heneage</span>, <span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Thomas</span>. <span class="smcap">Miss Heneage</span> <i>is a solidly built, narrow-minded
woman in her sixties. She makes no effort to look younger than
she is, and is expensively but quietly dressed, with heavy elegance.
She commands her household and her family connection, and on
the strength of a large and steady income feels that her opinion has
its value.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore</span> <i>is a semi-professional invalid,
refined and unintelligent. Her movements are weak and fatigued.
Her voice is habitually plaintive and she is entirely a lady without
a trace of being a woman of fashion.</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>is an easy-mannered,
but respectful family servant, un-English both in style
and appearance. He has no deportment worthy of being so called,
and takes an evident interest in the affairs of the family he serves.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage</span> <i>is seated at the tea-table, facing the footlights.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Phillimore</span> <i>is seated at the table on the right.</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>stands
near by. Tea things on table. Decanter of sherry in coaster.
Bread and butter on plate. Vase with flowers. Silver match-box.
Large old-fashioned tea urn. Guard for flame. "The Evening
Post" on tea-table.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Heneage</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore</span> <i>both
have cups of tea.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Heneage</span> <i>sits up very straight, and pours
tea for</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span>, <i>who enters from door. She is a pretty and fashionably
dressed girl of twenty. She speaks superciliously, coolly,
and not too fast. She sits on the sofa gracefully and without
lounging. She wears a gown suitable for spring visiting, hat,
parasol, and gloves.</i></p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> [<i>As she moves to the sofa.</i>] I never in my life walked
so far and found so few people at home. [<i>Pauses. Takes off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>
gloves. Somewhat querulously.</i>] The fact is the nineteenth of
May is ridiculously late to be in town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> Thomas, Mr. Phillimore's sherry?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas.</span> [<i>Indicating the particular table.</i>] The sherry, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> Mr. Phillimore's <i>Post</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas.</span> [<i>Pointing to "The Evening Post" on the tea-table.</i>]
The <i>Post</i>, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> [<i>Indicating cup.</i>] Miss Phillimore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>takes cup of tea to</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span>. <i>Silence. They all sip tea.</i>
<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>goes back, fills sherry glass, remaining round and about
the tea-table. They all drink tea during their entire conversation.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> The Dudleys were at home. They wished to know
when my brother Philip was to be married, and where and how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> If the Dudleys were persons of breeding,
they'd not intrude their curiosity upon you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> I like Lena Dudley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore.</span> [<i>Speaking slowly and gently.</i>] Do I know
Miss Dudley?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> She knows Philip. She expects an announcement of
the wedding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore.</span> I trust you told her that my son, my sister
and myself are all of the opinion that those who have been divorced
should remarry with modesty and without parade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> I told the Dudleys Philip's wedding was here, to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore</span>, <i>picking up a sheet of
paper from the table.</i>] I have spent the afternoon, Mary, in
arranging and listing the wedding gifts, and in writing out the
announcements of the wedding. I think I have attained a proper
form of announcement. [<i>Taking the sheet of note-paper and giving
it to</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>.] Of course the announcement Philip himself made
was quite out of the question. [<span class="smcap">Grace</span> <i>smiles.</i>] However, there is
mine. [<i>She points to the paper.</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>gives the list to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Phillimore</span> <i>and moves away.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> I hope you'll send an announcement to the Dudleys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore.</span> [<i>Prepared to make the best of things, plaintively
reads.</i>] "Mr. Philip Phillimore and Mrs. Cynthia Dean
Karslake announce their marriage, May twentieth, at three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
o'clock, Nineteen A, Washington Square, New York." [<i>Replacing
the paper on</i> <span class="smcap">Thomas's</span> <i>salver.</i>] It sounds very nice.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>returns the paper to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Heneage</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> In my opinion it barely escapes sounding
nasty. However, it is correct. The only remaining question is&mdash;to
whom the announcement should not be sent. [<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>goes
out.</i>] I consider an announcement of the wedding of two divorced
persons to be in the nature of an intimate communication. It
not only announces the wedding&mdash;it also announces the divorce.
[<i>Returning to her teacup.</i>] The person I shall ask counsel of is
cousin William Sudley. He promised to drop in this afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> Oh! We shall hear all about Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore.</span> William is judicious. [<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>returns.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> [<i>With finality.</i>] Cousin William will disapprove
of the match unless a winter in Cairo has altered his moral
tone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas.</span> [<i>Announcing.</i>] Mr. Sudley.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>He ushers in</i> <span class="smcap">William Sudley</span>, <i>a little oldish gentleman. He is and
appears thoroughly insignificant. But his opinion of the place
he occupies in the world is enormous. His manners, voice,
presence, are all those of a man of breeding and self-importance.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> [<i>Rising and greeting</i>
<span class="smcap">Sudley</span>; <i>a little tremulously.</i>] My dear William!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>withdraws.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Shakes hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore</span>, <i>soberly glad
to see them.</i>] How d'ye do, Mary? [<i>Greeting</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Heneage</span>.]
A very warm May you're having, Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> [<i>Coming forward to welcome him.</i>] Dear Cousin
William!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> Wasn't it warm in Cairo when you left?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>She will have the strict truth, or nothing; still, on account of</i> <span class="smcap">Sudley's</span>
<i>impeccable respectability, she treats him with more than
usual leniency.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Sitting down.</i>] We left Cairo six weeks ago, Grace,
so I've had no news since you wrote in February that Philip was
engaged. [<i>After a pause.</i>] I need not to say I consider Philip's
engagement excessively regrettable. He is a judge upon the
Supreme Court bench with a divorced wife&mdash;and such a divorced
wife!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> Oh, but Philip has succeeded in keeping everything as
quiet as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Acidly.</i>] No, my dear! He has not succeeded in
keeping his former wife as quiet as possible. We had not been
in Cairo a week when who should turn up but Vida Phillimore.
She went everywhere and did everything no woman should!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> [<i>With unfeigned interest.</i>] Oh, what did she do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> She "did" Cleopatra at the tableaux at Lord Errington's!
She "did" Cleopatra, and she did it robed only in some
diaphanous material of a nature so transparent that&mdash;in fact she
appeared to be draped in moonshine. [<span class="smcap">Miss Heneage</span> <i>indicates
the presence of</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span> <i>and rises.</i>] That was only the beginning.
As soon as she heard of Philip's engagement, she gave a dinner in
honour of it! Only divorc&eacute;es were asked! And she had a dummy&mdash;yes,
my dear, a dummy!&mdash;at the head of the table. He stood
for Philip&mdash;that is he sat for Philip!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Rising and moving to the table.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> [<i>Irritated and disgusted.</i>] Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore.</span> [<i>With dismay and pain.</i>] Dear me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> [<i>Confident of the value of her opinion.</i>] I disapprove
of Mrs. Phillimore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Taking a cigarette.</i>] Of course you do, but has Philip
taken to Egyptian cigarettes in order to celebrate my winter at
Cairo?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> Those are Cynthia's.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Thinking that no one is worth knowing whom he does
not know.</i>] Who is "Cynthia?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> Mrs. Karslake&mdash;She's staying here, Cousin William.
She'll be down in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Shocked.</i>] You don't mean to tell me&mdash;?&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> Yes, William, Cynthia is Mrs. Karslake&mdash;Mrs.
Karslake has no New York house. I disliked the publicity
of a hotel in the circumstances, and, accordingly, when she
became engaged to Philip, I invited her here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Suspicious and distrustful.</i>] And may I ask <i>who</i> Mrs.
Karslake is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> [<i>With confidence.</i>] She was a Deane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Walking about the room, sorry to be obliged to concede
good birth to any but his own blood.</i>] Oh, oh&mdash;well, the Deanes are
extremely nice people. [<i>Approaching the table.</i>] Was her father
J. William Deane?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> [<i>Nodding, still more secure.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Giving in with difficulty.</i>] The family is an old one.
J. William Deane's daughter? Surely he left a very considerable&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> Oh, fifteen or twenty millions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Determined not to be dazzled.</i>] If I remember rightly
she was brought up abroad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> In France and England&mdash;and I fancy brought
up with a very gay set in very gay places. In fact she is what is
called a "sporty" woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Always ready to think the worst.</i>] We might put up
with that. But you don't mean to tell me Philip has the&mdash;the&mdash;assurance
to marry a woman who has been divorced by&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> Not at all. Cynthia Karslake divorced her
husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Gloomily, since he has less fault to find than he expected.</i>]
She divorced him! Ah!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>He seeks the consolation of his tea.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> The suit went by default. And, my dear
William, there are many palliating circumstances. Cynthia was
married to Karslake only seven months. There are no&mdash; [<i>Glancing
at</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span>] no hostages to Fortune! Ahem!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Still unwilling to be pleased.</i>] Ah! What sort of a
young woman is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> [<i>With the superiority of one who is not too popular.</i>]
Men admire her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> She's not conventional.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore.</span> [<i>Showing a faint sense of justice.</i>] I am
bound to say she has behaved discreetly ever since she arrived
in this house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> Yes, Mary&mdash;but I sometimes suspect that
she exercises a degree of self-control&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Glad to have something against some one.</i>] She claps
on the lid, eh? And you think that perhaps some day she'll boil
over? Well, of course fifteen or twenty millions&mdash;but who's
Karslake?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> [<i>Very superciliously.</i>] He owns Cynthia K. She's the
famous mare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Heneage.</span> He's Henry Karslake's son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Beginning to make the best of fifteen millions-in-law.</i>]
Oh!&mdash;Henry!&mdash;Very respectable family. Although I remember<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
his father served a term in the Senate. And so the wedding is
to be to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Phillimore.</span> [<i>Assenting.</i>] To-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Rising, his respectability to the front when he thinks of
the ceremony.</i> <span class="smcap">Grace</span> <i>rises.</i>] To-morrow. Well, my dear Sarah,
a respectable family with some means. We must accept her.
But on the whole, I think it will be best for me not to see the
young woman. My disapprobation would make itself apparent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grace.</span> [<i>Whispering to</i> <span class="smcap">Sudley</span>.] Cynthia's coming.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>He doesn't hear.</i></span><br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>comes in, absorbed in reading a newspaper. She is a
young creature in her twenties, small and high-bred, full of the
love of excitement and sport. Her manner is wide-awake and
keen, and she is evidently in no fear of the opinion of others.
Her dress is exceedingly elegant, but with the elegance of a
woman whose chief interests lie in life out of doors. There is
nothing hard or masculine in her style, and her expression is
youthful and ingenuous.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>Sententious and determinately epigrammatic.</i>] The
uncouth modern young woman, eight feet high, with a skin like

made a bold bid for victory&mdash;neck by neck&mdash;for a quarter&mdash;when
Flying Cloud slipped by the pair and won on the post by a
nose in one forty nine!" [<i>Speaking with the enthusiasm of a sport.</i>]
Oh, I wish I'd seen the dear thing do it. Oh, it's Mr. Sudley!
You must think me very rude. How do you do, Mr. Sudley?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> My dear Mrs. Karslake, I think it might be wiser&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Still with cordial good temper.</i>] Oh, but you must

That sounds rather miscellaneous, but you know what I mean.</p>

he's in trouble! You'll come, won't you&mdash;but of course you
will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sudley.</span> [<i>After a self-important pause.</i>] I will come, Mrs.
Karslake. [<i>Pausing.</i>] Good-afternoon. [<i>In a tone of sorrow and
light compassion.</i>] Good-bye, Mary. Good-afternoon, Sarah.

my presence isn't too agitating?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> Ah&mdash;it's just because I value this hour with you,

the calm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[Pg 622]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> [<i>Sighs.</i>] Yes, the calm&mdash;the Halcyon calm of&mdash;of

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Puzzled.</i>] Was the case brought against you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> Oh&mdash;no. The suit was brought by Haggerty, Miss
Haggerty, a dressmaker, against the&mdash;in fact, my dear, against
the former Mrs. Phillimore.      [<i>After a pause, he returns to his
reading.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Curious about the matter.</i>] How did you decide it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> I was obliged to decide in Mrs. Phillimore's favour.
Haggerty's plea was preposterous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Did you&mdash;did you meet the&mdash;the&mdash;former&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> How did you recognize&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Why&mdash; [<i>Opening the paper.</i>] because Mrs. Vida

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Much excited and aroused.</i>] Philip! Don't speak of
him. He's nothing. He's a thing of the past. I never think of
him. I forget him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> [<i>Somewhat sarcastic.</i>] That's extraordinarily original

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>After a pause.</i>] Bankrupt? [<i>Excited and moved.</i>]
Let's not speak of him. I mean never to see him or think about
him or even hear of him! [<i>He assents. She reads her paper. He

pleasantly self-important.</i>] No, really, it was a wonderful sermon,
my dear. My text was from Paul&mdash;"It is better to marry than to
burn." It was a strictly logical sermon. I argued&mdash;that, as the
grass withereth, and the flower fadeth,&mdash;there is nothing final in
Nature; not even Death! And, as there is nothing final in
Nature, not even Death;&mdash;so then if Death is not final&mdash;why
should marriage be final? [<i>Gently.</i>] And so the necessity of&mdash;eh&mdash;divorce!

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Hate to see a pretty woman married. Might

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Admire you, Mrs. Karslake&mdash;</p>

warm, starry night, moonbeams and ilex trees, "and a spirit

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> What country and state of affairs do you think you
have landed in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> New York, by Jove! Been to school, too. New
York is bounded on the North, South, East and West by the
state of Divorce! Come, come, Mrs. Karslake, I like your
country. You've no fear and no respect&mdash;no cant and lots of can.
Here you all are, you see&mdash;your former husband, and your new
husband's former wife&mdash;sounds like Ollendoff! Eh? So there
you are, you see! But, jokin' apart&mdash;why do you marry him?
Oh, well, marry him if you must! You can run around the corner
and get a divorce afterwards&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I believe you think they throw one in with an ice-cream
soda!</p>

balcony, from which the trees of Central Park can be seen. There
is a table between them; a mirror, a scent bottle, &amp;c., upon it. On
the right, up stage, is a door; on the right, down stage, another
door. A lady's writing-table stands between the two, nearer centre
of stage. There is another door up stage; below it, an open fireplace,
filled with potted plants, andirons, &amp;c., not in use. Over it
is a tall mirror; on the mantel-piece are a French clock, candelabra,
vases, &amp;c. On a line with the fireplace is a lounge, gay with silk
pillows. A florist's box, large and long, filled with American

<p><span class="smcap">Benson.</span> Yes, ma'am, and the ticker's been mended. The

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Looking at her watch which lies on the dressing-table.</i>]
My watch has stopped.</p>

Five to eleven, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Getting promptly to work.</i>] H'm, h'm, I shall be caught.

has the long box of roses at her side on a small table, a vase of water
on the floor by her side. She cuts the stems and places the roses in the
vase. When she feels that she has reached a picturesque position, in
which any onlooker would see in her a creature filled with the love of
flowers and of her fellow man, she says:</i>] There! [<i>The door opens

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Languorously, but with a faint suggestion of humour.</i>]
Is that really you, Sir John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Lively and far from being impressed by</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span>.] I see now

You look as fresh as paint. [<i>He lays his gloves and riding crop on

Oh, you're describing the horse! By "her," I meant&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Irritated by the remembrance of his wife.</i>] Cynthia

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>With artful soothing.</i>] There is only one thing I want
to talk about, and that is, <i>you</i>! Why were you unhappy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Still cross.</i>] Why does a dollar last such a short
time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Curious.</i>] Why did you part?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Did you ever see a schooner towed by a tug? Well, I
parted from Cynthia for the same reason that the hawser parts
from the tug&mdash;I couldn't stand the tug.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Sympathizing.</i>] Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>After a pause, and still cross.</i>] Awful cheerful morning

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Excusing her curiosity and coming back to love as the

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Very nonchalantly.</i>] Why do <i>I</i> like you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Doing her best to charm.</i>] I won't tell you&mdash;it would

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Not a bit impressed by</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span>, <i>but humanly ready to
flirt.</i>] Tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> There's a rose for you.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>Giving him the one she has in her hand.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Saying what is plainly expected of him.</i>] I want more

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Passing over this insinuation.</i>] You refuse to tell
me&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Once more reminded of</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <i>speaks with sudden

we parted; or at least we wrangled and jangled. [<i>Sighs.</i>] Ha!
Why weren't we happy? Don't ask me, why! It may have been
<i>partly</i> my fault!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>With tenderness.</i>] Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>His mind on</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.] But I believe it's all in the
way a girl's brought up. Our girls are brought up to be ignorant
of life&mdash;they're ignorant of life. Life is a joke, and marriage is a
picnic, and a man is a shawl-strap&mdash; 'Pon my soul, Cynthia
Deane&mdash;no, I can't tell you! [<i>In great irritation, he rises abruptly,
and strides up and down the room.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Gently.</i>] Please tell me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Well, she was an heiress, an American heiress&mdash;and
she'd been taught to think marriage meant burnt almonds and
moonshine and a yacht and three automobiles, and she thought&mdash;I
don't know what she thought, but I tell you, Mrs. Phillimore,
marriage is three parts love and seven parts forgiveness of sins.
[<i>He continues restlessly to pace the floor as he speaks of</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Flattering him as a matter of second nature.</i>] She never
loved you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>On whom she has made no impression at all.</i>] Yes, she
did. For six or seven months there was not a shadow between us.
It was perfect, and then one day she went off like a pistol-shot!
I had a piece of law work and couldn't take her to see Flashlight
race the Maryland mare. The case meant a big fee, big Kudos,
and in sails Cynthia, Flashlight-mad! And will I put on my hat
and take her? No&mdash;and bang she goes off like a stick o' dynamite&mdash;what
did I marry her for?&mdash;and words&mdash;pretty high words,
until she got mad, when she threw over a chair, and said, oh, well,&mdash;marriage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span>
was a failure, or it was with me, so I said she'd better try
somebody else. She said she would, and marched out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Gently sarcastic.</i>] But she came back!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> She came back, but not as you mean. She stood at the
door and said, "Jack, I shall divorce you." Then she came over
to my study-table, dropped her wedding ring on my law papers,
and went out. The door shut, I laughed; the front door slammed,
I damned. [<i>After a silence, moving abruptly to the window.</i>] She
never came back. [<i>He turns away and then, recovering, moves
toward</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span>, <i>who catches his hands.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Hoping for a contradiction.</i>] She's broken your heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Taking a chair by the lounge.</i>] Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Encouraged, begins to play the game again.</i>] You'll
never love again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Speaking to her from the foot of the sofa.</i>] Try me! Try
me! Ah, no, Mrs. Phillimore, I shall laugh, live, love and make
money again! And let me tell you one thing&mdash;I'm going to rap
her one over the knuckles. She had a stick of a Connecticut
lawyer, and he&mdash;well, to cut a legal story short, since Mrs. Karslake's
been in Europe, I have been quietly testing the validity of
the decree of divorce. Perhaps you don't understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Displaying her innate shrewdness.</i>] Oh, about a divorce,
everything!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I shall hear by this evening whether the divorce will
stand or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> But it's to-day at three she marries&mdash;you won't let her
commit bigamy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Shaking his head.</i>] I don't suppose I'd go as far as
that. It may be the divorce will hold, but anyway I hope never
to see her again.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[<i>He sits down beside her so that their faces are now directly opposite.

two people who have <i>suffered</i> and made their own mistakes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Playing the game too, but not playing it well.</i>] But you
see, you don't <i>really</i> love me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Still ready to say what is expected.</i>] Cynthia&mdash;Vida,
no man can sit beside you and look into your eyes without
feeling&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Speaking the truth as she sees it, seeing that her methods
don't succeed.</i>] Oh! That's not love! That's simply&mdash;well, my
dear Jack, it's beginning at the wrong end. And the truth is you
hate Cynthia Karslake with such a whole-hearted hate, that you
haven't a moment to think of any other woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>With sudden anger.</i>] I hate her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Very softly and most sweetly.</i>] Jack&mdash;Jack, I could be
as foolish about you as&mdash;oh, as foolish as anything, my dear!
And perhaps some day&mdash;perhaps some day you'll come to me and
say, Vida, I am totally indifferent to Cynthia&mdash;and then&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>The ideal woman in mind.</i>] Then, perhaps, you and I
may join hands and stroll together into the Garden of Eden. It
takes two to find the Garden of Eden, you know&mdash;and once we're

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Sauntering slowly toward the mirror as she speaks.</i>]
Oh, I saw that you admired her! And of course, she did say she

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Attempting to dam the stream of her talk which
flows gently but steadily on.</i>] May I ask you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> And, indeed, if she came now, Mr. Karslake has gone,
and her sole object in coming was to make him uncomfortable.
[<i>She moves toward the table, stopping a half minute at the mirror
to see that she looks as she wishes to look.</i>] Very dangerous symptom,
too, that passionate desire to make one's former husband
unhappy! But, I can't believe that your admiration for Cynthia
Karslake is so warm that it led you to pay me this visit a half
hour too early in the hope of seeing&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Rising; most civil, but speaking his mind like a
Briton.</i>] I say, would you mind stopping a moment! [<i>She
smiles.</i>] I'm not an American, you know; I was brought up not

somebody didn't interrupt you, you'd go on forever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Passing him to tantalize.</i>] My point is you come to
see Cynthia&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Believing she means it.</i>] I came hopin' to see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Provokingly.</i>] Cynthia!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Perfectly single-minded and entirely taken in.</i>]
But I would have come even if I'd known&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Evading him, while he follows.</i>] I don't believe it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Protesting whole-heartedly.</i>] Give you my word
I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Leading him on.</i>] You're here to see <i>her</i>! And of
course&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Determined to be heard because, after all, he's a
man.</i>] May I have the&mdash;eh&mdash;the floor? [<span class="smcap">Vida</span> <i>sits down in a

that, and I hoped to see her here, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Talking nonsense and knowing it.</i>] You had another
object in coming. In fact, you came to see Cynthia, and you
came to see me! What I really long to know is, why you wanted
to see <i>me</i>! For, of course, Cynthia's to be married at three!
And, if she wasn't she wouldn't have you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Not intending to wound; merely speaking the
flat truth.</i>] Well, I mean to jolly well ask her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Still indignant.</i>] And you came here, to my house&mdash;in
order to ask her&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Truthful even on a subtle point.</i>] Oh, but that's
only my first reason for coming, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Concealing her hopes.</i>] Well, now I <i>am</i> curious&mdash;what

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Simply.</i>] Are you feelin' pretty robust?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> I don't know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Crosses to the buffet.</i>] Will you have something,
and then I'll tell you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Gaily.</i>] Can't I support the news without&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Trying to explain his state of mind, a feat which
he has never been able to accomplish.</i>] Mrs. Phillimore, you see it's
this way. Whenever you're lucky, you're too lucky. Now, Mrs.
Karslake is a nipper and no mistake, but as I told you, the very

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Gently rising and affecting a tender surprise.</i>] What!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Rising with her.</i>] That's it!&mdash;You're over! [<i>He
suggests with his right hand the movement of a horse taking a hurdle.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Very sweetly.</i>] You don't really mean&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Carried away for the moment by so much true

Cynthia&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Admitting the fact.</i>] Well, she did&mdash;she did
bowl my wicket, but so did you&mdash;</p>

a limit to&mdash;      [<i>She sits down.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Roused by so much loveliness of soul.</i>] Now, see
here, Mrs. Phillimore! You and I are not bottle babies, eh, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>
we? You've been married and&mdash;I&mdash;I've knocked about, and we
both know there's a lot of stuff talked about&mdash;eh, eh, well, you
know:&mdash;the one and only&mdash;that a fellow can't be awfully well
smashed by two at the same time, don't you know! All rubbish!
You know it, and the proof of the puddin's in the eatin', I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>With gentle reproach.</i>] May I ask where I come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Well, now, Mrs. Phillimore, I'll be frank with
you, Cynthia's my favourite, but you're runnin' her a close
second in the popular esteem!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Laughing, determined not to take offense.</i>] What a
delightful, original, fantastic person you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Frankly happy that he has explained everything so

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Oh, just the usual,&mdash;eh,&mdash;thing,&mdash;the&mdash;eh&mdash;the

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>A shade piqued, but determined not to risk showing it.</i>]
And you call that the same old usual question?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Yes, I know, but&mdash;but will you? I sail in a

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Curt and agitated.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Ready to fight.</i>] And you guessed I would do that?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[Pg 655]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Speaks with agitation, frankness and good will.</i>]
Jack&mdash;I mean, Mr. Karslake,&mdash;no, I mean, Jack! I came because&mdash;well,
you see, it's my wedding day!&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;was
rude to you last evening. I'd like to apologize and make peace
with you before I go&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Determined to be disagreeable.</i>] Before you go to your
last, long home!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I came to apologize.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> But you'll remain to quarrel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Still frank and kind.</i>] I will not quarrel. No!&mdash;and
I'm only here for a moment. I'm to be married at three, and
just look at the clock! Besides, I told Philip I was going to
Louise's shop, and I did&mdash;on the way here; but, you see, if I stay
too long he'll telephone Louise and find I'm not there, and he
might guess I was here. So you see I'm risking a scandal. And
now, Jack, see here, I lay my hand on the table, I'm here on the
square, and,&mdash;what I want to say is, why&mdash;Jack, even if we have
made a mess of our married life, let's put by anger and pride.
It's all over now and can't be helped. So let's be human, let's be
reasonable, and let's be kind to each other! Won't you give me
your hand? [<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>refuses.</i>] I wish you every happiness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Turning away, the past rankling.</i>] I had a client once,
a murderer; he told me he murdered the man, and he told me,
too, that he never felt so kindly to anybody as he did to that man
after he'd killed him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Jack!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Unforgiving.</i>] You murdered my happiness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I won't recriminate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And now I must put by anger and pride! I do! But
not self-respect, not a just indignation&mdash;not the facts and my
clear memory of them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Jack!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>With growing emotion, and holding out her hand.</i>]
I give you one more chance! Yes, I'm determined to be generous.
I forgive everything you ever did to me. I'm ready to be friends.
I wish you every happiness and every&mdash;every&mdash;horse in the
world! I can't do more than that! [<i>She offers it again.</i>] You
refuse?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Moved but surly.</i>] I like wildcats and I like Christians,
but I don't like Christian wildcats! Now I'm close hauled, trot
out your tornado! Let the Tiger loose! It's the tamer, the man
in the cage that has to look lively and use the red hot crowbar!
But, by Jove, I'm out of the cage! I'm a mere spectator of the
married circus!      [<i>He puffs vigorously.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Be a game sport then! Our marriage was a wager;
you wagered you could live with me. You lost; you paid with
a divorce; and now is the time to show your sporting blood.
Come on, shake hands and part friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Not in this world! Friends with you, no! I have a
proper pride. I don't propose to put my pride in my
pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Jealous and plain spoken.</i>] Oh, I wouldn't ask you
to put your pride in your pocket while Vida's handkerchief is
there. [<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>looks angered.</i>] Pretty little bijou of a handkerchief!
[<i>Pulling out the handkerchief.</i>] And she is charming, and
divorced, and reasonably well made up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh, well, Vida is a woman. [<i>Toying with the handkerchief.</i>]
I'm a man, a handkerchief is a handkerchief, and, as some
old Aristotle or other said, whatever concerns a woman, concerns
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Not oblivious of him, but in a low voice.</i>] Insufferable!
Well, yes. [<i>She sits down. She is too much wounded to make
any further appeal.</i>] You're perfectly right. There's no possible
harmony between divorced people! I withdraw my hand and all
good feeling. No wonder I couldn't stand you. Eh? However,
that's pleasantly past! But at least, my dear Karslake, let us
have some sort of beauty behaviour! If we cannot be decent, let
us endeavour to be graceful. If we can't be moral, at least we
can avoid being vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Well&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> If there's to be no more marriage in the world&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Cynically.</i>] Oh, but that's not it; there's to be more
and more and more!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>With a touch of bitterness.</i>] Very well! I repeat
then, if there's to be nothing but marriage and divorce, and re-marriage,
and re-divorce, at least, at least, those who <i>are</i> divorced
can avoid the vulgarity of meeting each other here, there, and
everywhere!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh, that's where you come out!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I thought so yesterday, and to-day I know it. It's
an insufferable thing to a woman of any delicacy of feeling to
find her husband&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Ahem&mdash;former!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> <i>Once</i> a husband always&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>In the same cynical tone.</i>] Oh, no! Oh, dear, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> To find her&mdash;to find the man she has once lived with&mdash;in
the house of&mdash;making love to&mdash;to find you here! [<span class="smcap">John</span>
<i>smiles and rises.</i>] You smile,&mdash;but I say, it should be a social
axiom, no woman should have to meet her former husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Cynical and cutting.</i>] Oh, I don't know; after I've
served my term I don't mind meeting my jailor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>takes chair near her.</i>] It's indecent&mdash;at
the horse-show, the opera, at races and balls, to meet the man
who once&mdash;It's not civilized! It's fantastic! It's half
baked! Oh, I never should have come here! [<i>He sympathizes,
and she grows irrational and furious.</i>] But it's entirely your
fault!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> My fault?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Working herself into a rage.</i>] Of course. What
business have you to be about&mdash;to be at large. To be at all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Gosh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Her rage increasing.</i>] To be where I am! Yes, it's
just as horrible for you to turn up in my life as it would be for a
dead person to insist on coming back to life and dinner and bridge!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Horrid idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Yes, but it's <i>you</i> who behave just as if you were not
dead, just as if I'd not spent a fortune on your funeral. You do;
you prepare to bob up at afternoon teas,&mdash;and dinners&mdash;and
embarrass me to death with your extinct personality!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Well, of course we <i>were</i> married, but it didn't quite
kill me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Angry and plain spoken.</i>] You killed yourself for
me&mdash;I divorced you. I buried you out of my life. If any human
soul was ever dead, you are! And there's nothing I so hate as a
gibbering ghost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh, I say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>With hot anger.</i>] Go gibber and squeak where
gibbering and squeaking are the fashion!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Laughing and pretending to a coldness he does not feel.</i>]
And so, my dear child, I'm to abate myself as a nuisance! Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>
as far as seeing you is concerned, for my part it's just like seeing
a horse who's chucked you once. The bruises are O. K., and you
see him with a sort of easy curiosity. Of course, you know, he'll
jolly well chuck the next man!&mdash;Permit me! [<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>picks up her
gloves, handkerchief and parasol, and gives her these as she drops
them one by one in her agitation.</i>] There's pleasure in the
thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And now, may I ask you a very simple question? Mere
curiosity on my part, but, why did you come here this
morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I have already explained that to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Not your real motive. Permit me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> But I believe I have guessed your real&mdash;permit me&mdash;your
real motive!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>With mock sympathy.</i>] Cynthia, I am sorry for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> H'm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Of course we had a pretty lively case of the fever&mdash;the
mutual attraction fever, and we <i>were</i> married a very short time.
And I conclude that's what's the matter with <i>you</i>! You see, my
dear, seven months of married life is too short a time to cure a
bad case of the fancies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>In angry surprise.</i>] What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Calm and triumphant.</i>] That's my diagnosis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Slowly and gathering herself together.</i>] I don't think
I understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh, yes, you do; yes, you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>With blazing eyes.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Would you mind not breaking my crop! Thank you!
I mean [<i>With polite impertinence.</i>] that ours was a case of premature
divorce, and, ahem, you're in love with me still.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Jack, some day you'll get the blind staggers from
conceit. No, I'm not in love with you, Mr. Karslake, but I
shouldn't be at all surprised if she were. She's just your sort,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Quickly.</i>] Why am I here! I'll tell you. I'm going

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Uncertain and discomfited.</i>] I know better!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> But I came for a serious purpose, too. I came, my
dear fellow, to make an experiment on myself. I've been with
you thirty minutes; and&mdash; [<i>She sighs with content.</i>] It's all
right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> What's all right?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Calm and apparently at peace with the world.</i>] I'm
immune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Immune?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> You're not catching any more! Yes, you see, I said
to myself, if I fly into a temper&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You did!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> If I fly into a temper when I see him, well, that shows
I'm not yet so entirely convalescent that I can afford to have
Jack Karslake at my house. If I remain calm I shall ask him to
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Routed.</i>] Ask me if you dare!      [<i>He rises.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Getting the whip hand for good.</i>] Ask you to dinner?
Oh, my dear fellow. [<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>rises.</i>] I'm going to do much more
than that. [<i>She rises.</i>] We must be friends, old man! We must
meet, we must meet often, we must show New York the way the
thing should be done, and, to show you I mean it&mdash;I want
you to be my best man, and give me away when I'm married this
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Incredulous and impatient.</i>] You don't mean that!</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<i>He pushes back his chair.</i></span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> There you are! Always suspicious!</p>

Of course, I told him you were not here, and hung up.</p>

Ma'am, the new footman's been talking with Mr. Phillimore on

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Making his appearance, perplexed and annoyed.</i>]

why you're cryin'. [<i>Sitting down beside her.</i>] You're marryin' the
wrong man! I'm sorry for you, but you're such a goose. Here
you are, marryin' this legal luminary. What for? You don't
know! He don't know! But I do! You pretend you're marryin'
him because it's the sensible thing; not a bit of it. You're marryin'
Mr. Phillimore because of all the other men you ever saw
he's the least like Jack Karslake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> That's a very good reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> There's only one good reason for marrying, and

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Your w'im wasn't wimmy enough, my dear! If

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Philip, I&mdash;eh&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> [<i>Sitting down at the table.</i>] What motive? What
reason? On our wedding day? Why did you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I'll tell you the truth. I was bored.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> [<i>Staggered.</i>] Bored? In my company?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I was bored, and then&mdash;and besides, Sir Wilfrid
asked me to go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> Exactly, and that was why you went. Cynthia, when
you promised to marry me, you told me you had forever done
with love. You agreed that marriage was the rational coming
together of two people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I know, I know!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> Do you believe that now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I don't know what I believe. My brain is in a

afraid that one can't just select a great and good man [<i>Indicating
him.</i>] and say: I will be happy with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> [<i>With complacent dignity.</i>] I don't see why not. You
must assuredly do one or the other: You must either let your
heart choose or your head select.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Gravely.</i>] No, there's a third scheme: Sir Wilfrid
explained the theory to me. A woman should marry whenever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span>
she has a whim for the man, and then leave the rest to the man.
Do you see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> [<i>Furious.</i>] Do I see? Have I ever seen any thing else?
Marry for whim! That's the New York idea of marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Observing cynically.</i>] New York ought to
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> Marry for whim and leave the rest to the divorce
court! Marry for whim and leave the rest to the man. That was
the former Mrs. Phillimore's idea. Only she spelled "whim"
differently; she omitted the "w." [<i>He rises in his anger.</i>] And
now you&mdash;<i>you</i> take up with this preposterous&mdash; [<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>
<i>moves uneasily.</i>] But, nonsense! It's impossible! A woman of
your mental calibre&mdash;No. Some obscure, primitive, female
<i>feeling</i> is at work corrupting your better judgment! What is it
you <i>feel</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Philip, you never felt like a fool, did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> No, never.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Politely.</i>] I thought not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> No, but whatever your feelings, I conclude you are
ready to marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Uneasy.</i>] Of course, I came back. I am here, am
I not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> You are ready to marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Twisting in the coils.</i>] But you haven't had your
dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> Do I understand you refuse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Couldn't we defer&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> You refuse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Desperately thinking of an escape from her promise,
and finding none.</i>] No, I said I'd marry you. I'm a woman of my
word. I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> [<i>Triumphant.</i>] Ah! Very good, then. Run to your
room. [<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.] Throw something over you.

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Humour,&mdash;Judge?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> It is, sir, and I'll not be bantered! Your both being

their courses do not violate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Now, Judge, never you mind what the stars do in their
divorces! Get down to earth of the present day. Rufus Choate
and Daniel Webster are dead. You must be modern. You must
let peroration and poetry alone! Come along now. Why
shouldn't I give the lady away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Hear! Hear! Oh, I beg your pardon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And why shouldn't we both be here? American marriage
is a new thing. We've got to strike the pace, and the only
trouble is, Judge, that the judiciary have so messed the thing up
that a man can't be sure he <i>is</i> married until he's divorced. It's a
sort of marry-go-round, to be sure! But let it go at that! Here
we all are, and we're ready to marry my wife to you, and start
her on her way to him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> [<i>Brought to a standstill.</i>] Good Lord! Sir, you cannot
trifle with monogamy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Now, now, Judge, monogamy is just as extinct as knee-breeches.
The new woman has a new idea, and the new idea is&mdash;well,
it's just the opposite of the old Mormon one. Their idea is
one man, ten wives and a hundred children. Our idea is one
woman, a hundred husbands and one child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> Sir, this is polyandry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Polyandry? A hundred to one it's polyandry; and
that's it, Judge! Uncle Sam has established consecutive polyandry,&mdash;but
there's got to be an interval between husbands! The
fact is, Judge, the modern American marriage is like a wire fence.
The woman's the wire&mdash;the posts are the husbands. [<i>He indicates
himself, and then</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.] One&mdash;two&mdash;three!
And if you cast your eye over the future you can count
them, post after post, up hill, down dale, all the way to Dakota!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Philip.</span> All very amusing, sir, but the fact remains&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Going to</i> <span class="smcap">Philip</span> <i>who at once moves away.</i>] Now, now,
Judge, I like you. But you're asleep; you're living in the dark
ages. You want to call up Central. "Hello, Central! Give me
the present time, 1906, New York!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Of course you do, and&mdash;there you are!</p>

going to try it again. [<i>She is unable to take her eyes from</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span> <i>and</i>

one doesn't do away with those calla lilies&mdash;the odor makes me
faint! [<span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid</span> <i>moves.</i>] No, it's not the lilies! It's the
orange blossoms!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Orange blossoms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> The flowers that grow on the tree that hangs over
the abyss! [<span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid</span> <i>promptly confiscates the vase of orange
blossoms.</i>] They smell of six o'clock in the evening. When
Philip's fallen asleep, and little boys are crying the winners outside,
and I'm crying inside, and dying inside and outside and
everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Returning to her side.</i>] Sorry to disappoint you.
They're artificial. [<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>shrugs her shoulders.</i>] That's it!
They're emblematic of artificial domesticity! And I'm here to
help you balk it. [<i>He sits down and</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>half rises and looks

Stop looking&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Do you think I can listen to you make love to me
when the man who&mdash;who&mdash;whom I most despise in all the world,
is reading poetry to the woman who&mdash;who got me into the fix
I'm in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Leaning over her chair.</i>] What do you want to
look at 'em for? [<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>moves.</i>] Let 'em be and listen to me!
Sit down; for damme, I'm determined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Now at the table and half to herself.</i>] I won't look
at them! I won't think of them. Beasts! [<span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid</span> <i>interposes

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Now, then&mdash;      [<i>He sits down.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Those two <i>here</i>! It's just as if Adam and Eve

What is it, what's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thomas.</span> Mr. Phillimore's excuses, ma'am. In a very short

[<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>appears faint.</i>] Can't ignore nature, Mrs. Karslake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[Pg 681]</a></span>
Yes, you are; you're forcin' your feelin's. [<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>glances at
him.</i>] And what you want to do is to let yourself go a bit&mdash;up
anchor and sit tight! I'm no seaman, but that's the idea!
[<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>moves and shakes her head.</i>] So just throw the reins on
nature's neck, jump this fellow Phillimore and marry me!</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Naturally, but with irritation.</i>] You propose to me

<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span>.] Stand over there&mdash;stand where you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> I say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I can hear you&mdash;I'm listening!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Well, don't look so hurried and worried. You've
got buttons and buttons of time. And now my offer. You
haven't yet said you would&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Marry you? I don't even know you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Feeling sure of being accepted.</i>] Oh,&mdash;tell you all
about myself. I'm no duke in a pickle o' debts, d'ye see? I can
marry where I like. Some o' my countrymen are rotters, ye know.
They'd marry a monkey, if poppa-up-the-tree had a corner in
cocoanuts! And they do marry some queer ones, y' know.
[<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>looks beyond him, exclaims and turns.</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid</span> <i>turns.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Do they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Oh, rather. That's what's giving your heiresses
such a bad name lately. If a fellah's in debt he can't pick and
choose, and then he swears that American gals are awfully fine
lookers, but they're no good when it comes to continuin' the
race! Fair dolls in the drawin'-room, but no good in the nursery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Thinking of</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span> <i>and nothing else.</i>] I can
see Vida in the nursery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> You understand when you want a brood mare,
you don't choose a Kentucky mule.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I think I see one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Well, that's what they're saying over there.
They say your gals run to talk [<i>He plainly remembers</i> <span class="smcap">Vida's</span>
<i>volubility.</i>] and I have seen gals here that would chat life into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[Pg 682]</a></span>
wooden Indian! That's what you Americans call being clever.&mdash;All
brains and no stuffin'! In fact, some of your American gals
are the nicest boys I ever met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> So that's what you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Not a bit what <i>I</i> think&mdash;what my countrymen
think!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Why are you telling me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Oh, just explaining my character. I'm the sort
that can pick and choose&mdash;and what I want is heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<span class="smcap">Vida</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>ever in mind.</i>] No more heart than
a dragon-fly!      [<i>The organ begins to play softly.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> That's it, dragon-fly. Cold as stone and never
stops buzzing about and showin' off her colours. It's that American
dragon-fly girl that I'm afraid of, because, d'ye see, I don't
know what an American expects when he marries; yes, but
you're not listening!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I am listening. I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Speaking directly to her.</i>] An Englishman, ye
see, when he marries expects three things: love, obedience, and
five children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Three things! I make it seven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Yes, my dear, but the point is, will you be
mistress of Traynham?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Who has only half listened to him.</i>] No, Sir Wilfrid,
thank you, I won't. [<i>She turns to see</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>walk across the
drawing-room with</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span>, <i>and apparently absorbed in what she is
saying.</i>] It's outrageous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Eh? Why you're cryin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Almost sobbing.</i>] I am not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> You're not crying because you're in love with
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I'm not crying&mdash;or if I am, I'm crying because I
love my country. It's a disgrace to America&mdash;cast-off husbands
and wives getting together in a parlour and playing tag under a
palm-tree. [<span class="smcap">John</span>, <i>with intention and determined to stab</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Eh! Oh! I'm damned! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.] What
do you think that means?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I don't doubt it means a wedding here, at once&mdash;after
mine! [<span class="smcap">Vida</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> <i>leave the drawing-room and walk
slowly toward them.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Affecting an impossible intimacy to wound</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>and

should know anything about it until it's all over!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Starting and looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid</span>.] What did I
tell you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>.] Oh, my dear, he's asked me to champagne
and lobster at <i>your</i> house&mdash;his house! Matthew is
coming! [<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>starts, but controls herself.</i>] And you're to
come, Sir Wilfrid. [<i>Intending to convey the idea of a sudden
marriage ceremony.</i>] Of course, my dear, I would like to wait for your
wedding, but something rather&mdash;rather important to me is to
take place, and I know you'll excuse me.      [<i>The organ stops.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Piqued at being forgotten.</i>] All very neat, but
you haven't given me a chance, even.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> Chance? You're not serious?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Striking while the iron is hot.</i>] I'll give you a minute
to offer yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> Sixty seconds from now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Uncertain.</i>] There's such a thing as bein' silly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Calm and determined.</i>] Fifty seconds left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> I take you&mdash;count fair. [<i>He hands her his watch
and goes to where</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>stands.</i>] I say, Mrs. Karslake&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Overwhelmed with grief and emotion.</i>] They're
engaged; they're going to be married to-night, over champagne
and lobster at my house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Will you consider your&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Hastily, to get rid of him.</i>] No, no, no, no! Thank
you, Sir Wilfrid, I will not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Calm, and not to be laid low.</i>] Thanks awfully.
[<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>walks away. Returning to</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span>.] Mrs. Phillimore&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> [<i>Returning his watch.</i>] Too late! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Karslake</span>.]
Jack, dear, we must be off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Standing and making a general appeal for information.</i>]
I say, is it the custom for American girls&mdash;that sixty
seconds or too late? Look here! Not a bit too late. I'll take
you around to Jack Karslake's, and I'm going to ask you the
same old question again, you know. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Vida</span>.] By Jove, you

Mrs. Karslake, I'm going; I'm sorry I came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Sorry? Why are you sorry? [<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>looks at her;
she winces a little.</i>] You've got what you wanted. [<i>After a
pause.</i>] I wouldn't mind your marrying Vida&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Gravely.</i>] Oh, wouldn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> But I don't think you showed good taste in engaging
yourselves <i>here</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Of course, I should have preferred a garden of roses and
plenty of twilight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Rushing into speech.</i>] I'll tell you what you <i>have</i>
done&mdash;you've thrown yourself away! A woman like that! No
head, no heart! All languor and loose&mdash;loose frocks&mdash;she's the
typical, worst thing America can do! She's the regular American
marriage worm!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I have known others&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Quickly.</i>] Not me. I'm not a patch on that
woman. Do you know anything about her life? Do you know
the things she did to Philip? Kept him up every night of his
life&mdash;forty days out of every thirty&mdash;and then, without his
knowing it, put brandy in his coffee to make him lively at
breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Banteringly.</i>] I begin to think she is just the
woman&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Unable to quiet her jealousy.</i>] She is <i>not</i> the woman
for <i>you</i>! A man with your bad temper&mdash;your airs of authority&mdash;your

old-fashioned, bread-poultice woman!</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Sharply.</i>] Can't say I've had any experience of the

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I don't care what you say! If you marry Vida
Phillimore&mdash;you sha'n't do it. [<i>Tears of rage choking her.</i>] No,
I liked your father and, for <i>his</i> sake, I'll see that his son doesn't
make a donkey of himself a second time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I don't pretend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Interrupting her; proud, serious and strong.</i>] How dare
you look me in the face with the eyes that I once kissed, and pretend
the least regard for me? [<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>recoils and looks away.

begin to understand our American women now. Fire-flies&mdash;and
the fire they gleam with is so cold that a midge couldn't warm his
heart at it, let alone a man. You're not of the same race as a

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Wounded to the heart.</i>] Jack! What are you

gesture, indicating the altar.</i>] Oh, you've taught me the trick of
your sex&mdash;you're the woman who's not a woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Weakly.</i>] You're saying terrible things to me.</p>

him.</i>] I don't know what you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>More forcibly and with manly emotion.</i>] You're not
able to forget me! You know you're not able to forget me; ask
yourself if you are able to forget me, and when your heart, such

<h2><a name="ACT_IV" id="ACT_IV"></a>ACT IV.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span> <i>The scene is laid in</i> <span class="smcap">John Karslake's</span> <i>study and smoking-room.
There is a bay window on the left. A door on the left leads
to stairs and the front of the house, while a door at the back leads
to the dining-room. A fireplace and a mantel are on the right. A
bookcase contains law and sporting books. On the wall is a full-length
portrait of</i> <span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>. <i>Nothing of this portrait is seen by
audience except the gilt frame and a space of canvas. A large
table with writing materials is littered over with law books, sporting
books, papers, pipes, crops, a pair of spurs, &amp;c. A wedding ring
lies on it. There are three very low easy-chairs. The general
appearance of the room is extremely gay and garish in colour. It
has the easy confusion of a man's room. There is a small table
on which, lying open, is a woman's sewing-basket, and, beside it, a
piece of rich fancy work, as if a lady had just risen from sewing.
Laid on the further end of it are a lady's gloves. On a chair-back
is a lady's hat. It is a half hour later than the close of Act III.
Curtains are drawn over the window. A lamp on the table is
lighted, as are, too, the various electric lights. One chair is conspicuously
standing on its head.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Nogam</span> <i>is busy at the larger table. The door into the dining-room
is half open.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> [<i>Coming in from the dining-room.</i>] Eh&mdash;what
did you say your name was?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nogam.</span> Nogam, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Nogam? I've been here thirty minutes. Where
are the cigars? [<span class="smcap">Nogam</span> <i>motions to a small table near the entrance
door.</i>] Thank you. Nogam, Mr. Karslake was to have followed
us here, immediately. [<i>He lights a cigar.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nogam.</span> Mr. Karslake just now 'phoned from his club [<span class="smcap">Sir
Wilfrid</span> <i>walks toward the front of the room.</i>], and he's on his way
home, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Nogam, why is that chair upside down?</p>

Reverend Matthew declared she left Phillimore's house before

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">[<span class="smcap">Nogam</span> <i>evidently takes this in.</i></span><br />

had the time to get here and make us man and wife, don't y' know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> Oh, Matthew had a fast horse and Cynthia a slow one&mdash;or
she's a woman and changed her mind! Perhaps she's gone
back and married Phillimore. And besides, dear, Matthew
wasn't in the house four minutes and a half; only just long
enough to hoop the hoop. [<i>She twirls her new wedding ring gently
about her finger.</i>] Wasn't it lucky he had a ring in his
pocket?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> Rather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vida.</span> And are you aware, dear, that Phillimore bought and
intended it for Cynthia? Do come [<i>Going toward the door through
which she has just entered.</i>], I'm desperately hungry! Whenever
I'm married that's the effect it has! [<span class="smcap">Vida</span> <i>goes out and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Wilfrid.</span> We'll give Mr. Karslake ten minutes, Nogam.

<p><span class="smcap">Fiddler.</span> Who was the parson I met leaving the house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nogam.</span> [<i>Whispering.</i>] Sir Wilfrid and Mrs. Phillimore have

<p><span class="smcap">Fiddler.</span> [<i>Putting the chair down in surprise.</i>] Does it live on
its blooming head?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nogam.</span> Don't you remember? <i>She</i> threw it on its head when
she left here, and he won't have it up. Ah, that's it&mdash;hat, sewing-basket

handed him his knock-out.      [<i>A bell rings outside.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fiddler.</span> There's the guv'nor&mdash;I hear him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nogam.</span> I'll serve the supper. [<i>Taking a letter from his pocket

this to the guv'nor? It's from his lawyer&mdash;his lawyer couldn't
find him and left it with me. He said it was very important.

He nurses his wrath to keep it warm. So, after all, Fiddler,
everything <i>is</i> changed, and that chair is the proof of it. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span>

whinney whether I'm alive or dead. [<i>She breaks down and sobs.</i>]
How is she, Fiddler?</p>

you've a long life before you, in which to learn how such a state

kind enough to get me a cab?                [<i>She moves to the door.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Certainly. I was going to say I am not surprised at

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Suddenly and quickly.</i>] It's just simply a fact,

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Oh&mdash;H'm! ah&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>After a pause.</i>] You probably felt jealous of Phillimore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Reasonably, sweetly, and in doubt.</i>] N-o! [<i>Apologetically.</i>]
I felt simply: Let him take his medicine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> I beg your pardon&mdash;I meant&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> You meant what you said!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> It isn't what you <i>say</i>&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;it's everything.
It's the entire situation. Suppose by any chance I don't marry
Phillimore! And suppose I were seen at two or three in the
morning leaving my former husband's house! It's all wrong. I
have no business to be here! I'm going! You're perfectly horrid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[Pg 698]</a></span>
to me, you know&mdash;and&mdash;the whole place&mdash;it's so familiar, and

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Discord and misery&mdash;I know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Not at all with discord and misery! With harmony
and happiness&mdash;with&mdash;with first love, and infinite hope&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Jack
Karslake,&mdash;if you don't set that chair on its legs, I
think I'll explode. [<span class="smcap">John</span> <i>crosses the room rapidly, and sets the

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>While setting chair on its legs.</i>] There! I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Nervously.</i>] I believe I hear Philip. [<i>She rises.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Going up to the window.</i>] N-o! That's the policeman
trying the front door! And now, see here, Mrs. Karslake,&mdash;you're
only here for a short minute, because you can't help yourself,
but I want you to understand that I'm not trying to be
disagreeable&mdash;I don't want to revive all the old unhappy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Very well, if you don't&mdash;give me my hat. [<span class="smcap">John</span>

the several articles which lie on the small table.</i>] Thanks!
[<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span> <i>throws the lot into the fireplace, and returns to the place

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Laughing.</i>] My stars, what a pleasure it is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> What is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Seeing you in a whirlwind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Wounded by his seeming indifference.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> No, but I mean, a real pleasure! Why not? Time's
passed since you and I were together&mdash;and&mdash;eh&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> And you've forgotten what a vile temper I had!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> [<i>Reflectively.</i>] Well, you did kick the stuffing out of the
matrimonial buggy&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> [<i>Pointedly but with good temper.</i>] It wasn't a buggy;
it was a break cart&mdash; [<i>She stands back of the arm-chair.</i>] It's
all very well to blame me! But when you married me, I'd never
had a bit in my mouth!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Well, I guess I had a pretty hard hand. Do you
remember the time you threw both your slippers out of the window?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Yes, and do you remember the time you took my
fan from me by force?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> After you slapped my face with it!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Oh, oh! I hardly touched your face! And do you
remember the day you held my wrists?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> You were going to bite me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> Jack! I never! I showed my teeth at you! And I

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Cynthia, I never knew you to break your word! [<i>He
laughs. Casually.</i>] And anyhow&mdash;they were awfully pretty
teeth! [<span class="smcap">Cynthia</span>, <i>though bolt upright, has ceased to seem pained.</i>]

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Well, hang it, my dear child, I&mdash;I'm sorry, but you
know I always got foolish with you. Your laugh'd make a horse
laugh. Why, don't you remember that morning in the park

away with you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynthia.</span> I do, I do! [<i>Both laugh. The door opens and</i>

laughing? [<i>Laughing, she sits down and laughs again.</i>] That
morning. Wasn't it somebody we met? [<i>Laughing afresh.</i>]
Wasn't it a man on a horse? [<i>As her memory pieces the picture, she
again goes off into laughter.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
