FROM LOSSING'S "WAR OF 1812."


"Evidently ashamed of the barbarism committed
by British hands, Vice-Admiral Cochrane
attempted to palliate it by a pitiful trick. After
the destruction of the capital, and the invaders
were safely back on their vessels in the Patuxent,
Cochrane wrote a letter to Secretary Monroe, in
which he said to him, 'Having been called upon
by the Governor-General of the Canadas to aid
him in carrying into effect measures of retaliation
against the inhabitants of the United States
for the wanton destruction committed by their
army in Upper Canada, it has become imperiously
my duty, conformably with the Governor-General's
application, to issue to the naval force
under my command an order to destroy and lay
waste such towns and districts upon the coast
as may be found assailable.' Cochrane then expressed
a hope that the 'conduct of the executive
of the United States would authorize him in
staying such proceedings, by making reparation
to the suffering inhabitants of Upper Canada,'
etc. This letter was antedated August 18, or
six days before the battle of Bladensburg, so as[Pg iv]
to appear like a humane suggestion, in the noncompliance
with which might be found an excuse
for the destruction of the national capital. It
did not reach Mr. Monroe until the morning of
the 31st of August, a week after Washington was
devastated, when that officer, in a dignified reply,
reminded the vice-admiral that the wanton destruction
by the British of Frenchtown, Frederick,
Georgetown, and Havre de Grace, and the
outrages at Hampton by the same people, had occurred
long before the destruction of Newark."

YOUNG SPIES.



[Pg 1]
CHAPTER I.

CAPTAIN JOSHUA BARNEY.


It is two years since what we called the "War
of 1812" came to an end, and I, Amos Grout,
once owner of the oyster pungy, Avenger, propose
to set down here that which happened to my
friend, Jeremiah Sackett, and myself, during the
year of grace, 1814, when, so others have said,
we did good work for our country, although at
the time neither of us was more than fifteen
years old.

This I do for two reasons, first because I am
proud of what we two lads succeeded in doing,
and hope that at some day, when, mayhap, both
Jerry and I are dead, other boys may read of the
part we played, and be encouraged thereby to
work out their own plans for the good.

Secondly, because I would have it known that[Pg 2]
through a scheme of his, two boys, living on the
shore of Chesapeake bay, succeeded in doing what
experienced men might have failed at, and I am
eager to have others realize my friend's worth.

So much for the reason as to why I, a seventeen-year
boy, with none too many advantages in
the way of book education, am thus attempting
to write a tale for others, and now, that whoever
should chance to read this may feel acquainted
with us, it is for me to introduce my friend and
myself in regular story-telling shape.

We lads lived in Benedict, Charles County,
Maryland, near the mouth of Indian Creek, when
the war broke out, and while many of the people
of our town were not pleased with the idea of
fighting the Britishers again simply to establish
the rights of our American seamen, Jerry and
I were hot in favor of it, for, in 1810, my friend's
brother Tom was taken by the king's officers
out of his vessel while she was off the capes, on
the false ground that he was born in England.
The poor fellow was forced to serve in the English
navy three years, leading a dog's life, as can
well be imagined, since he would never say that
he was willing to serve his majesty to the best
of his ability.

Therefore it was that when we invested our
savings in a small sloop-rigged pungy, with the
idea of making a living by fishing, we named her
the Avenger, with never a thought that she[Pg 3]
might one day do something toward avenging
poor Tom's wrongs.

Jerry's parents and mine were poor people,
who could not afford to give their sons what so
many fortunate lads have       a good education,
fine clothes and money to spend. We were
obliged to do all we could to aid our families,
and had been wage-earners since our tenth birthday.

It would be too long a story if I should attempt
to set down all that my friend and I did
by way of gathering up money enough to pay
Nicholas Trundy one hundred dollars for his
pungy, which was then going on six years old.
It was a big lot of money for two lads to save,
after contributing to the support of their families,
and we were near to four years doing it.

It was a proud day for us when the little vessel
became our property, and we painted out the
name "Handsome Susan," to put in its place in
big red letters, "The Avenger."

She was about twenty-four feet long, with a
cuddy in which were four small bunks, and had
been in the oyster business since being launched,
as we intended she should remain there.

We bought her early in the spring of 1812,
when the people were talking strongly for or
against war; but it never entered our minds that
we might get mixed up in the fighting, for who
could ever have dreamed that the Britishers[Pg 4]
would come to Benedict? It was enough to
satisfy us that the oyster business was fairly
good, and that we could often earn, with the
pungy, as high as three dollars a day, not counting
the time occupied in running up to Annapolis
or Baltimore.

During the second year of the war we did not
do as well; but there is no good reason why I
should go into all the details of what would not
be entertaining save to an oysterman. It is
enough if I jump over to the spring of 1814, when
we made a trade with an old sailor by name of
Darius Thorpe, whereby he was to sail with us
for one-third of the profits after all expenses had
been paid, and this bargain was a good one for
us lads, since he was a master-hand at dredging,
being able to work all around either Jerry or me.

Besides being an expert fisherman, old Darius
was an artist at story-telling, and there was
hardly an evening during the first two months
he was with us, when we did not sit in the cuddy
long after we should have been asleep, listening
to the old man's yarns.

Then, as everybody knows, about April, Captain
Joshua Barney was ordered to fit up a fleet
of small boats to protect the towns of the bay,
for by this time we were having mighty good
proof that the United States was at war with
England, and it stands to reason that we lads
were eager to know all that was possible concern[Pg 5]ing
this officer, who had been the most successful
of the privateers sailing out of Baltimore.

We were on our way to Annapolis with half a
load of oysters when the news was given us by
the captain of the Oriole, while he quoted the
prices he got for his cargo, and since the Avenger
was creeping along lazily, with about one-quarter
as much wind as she needed, we had plenty of
time in which to discuss a matter that seemed to
be of very great importance to us.

"There won't be any foolin' when Joshua
Barney gets here, no matter how big or how little
his fleet is," Darius said as he laid at full length
on the deck sunning himself, and in a twinkling
it flashed across me that the old man may have
sailed with or under the gentleman who was to
command such a naval force as could be gathered
in the Chesapeake bay, therefore I asked:

"Do you happen to know the captain, Darius?"

We always called the old man by his first name,
because he insisted so strongly that we should;
said it made him feel at home, and sounded a
good deal like putting on airs to tack on the
"Mister."

"Know him?" the old man cried, rising lazily
on one elbow and swinging half around to look
at me as I sat on the rudder-head. "I know him
lock, stock an' ramrod, lad. The last deep sea
cruise I went on was with him. He's a snorter,
that's what he is, an' I've heard his whole story[Pg 6]
a hundred times over. I tell you, lads, there's
nothin' in a book that can come up with Josh
Barney's doin's."

"Give us the full yarn, Darius!" Jerry cried.
"We're like to be loafin' around here a good
many hours, if this wind holds soft as I reckon
it will, an' we may as well make the most of the
time."

Darius was always ready to spin a yarn, which
was much in his favor according to my way of
thinking; but he couldn't seem to rattle the words
off easy like except when his mouth was full of
tobacco, therefore Jerry and I could always tell
whether the story was to be long or short, by the
amount of roughly-cured plug he stowed between
his jaws.

It was a mighty big chew he took while making
ready to tell of Captain Barney, and I must say
for Darius, that he never spun a yarn which
interested me more than the one I count on setting
down here.

"Josh Barney was born somewhere along 1759
in Baltimore," the old man began slowly, as
if determined to give a regular biography of the
captain. "His folks let him go to school till he
was ten years old, an' then he began to shift for
himself by goin' into a store; but, bless you, he
never was made for that kind of work, an' before
two years passed he found it out. Went
over to Baltimore one day on a visit, an' wound[Pg 7]
up by shippin' on a pilot-boat; but even that
wasn't what he hankered for, an' finally his
father shipped him as apprentice to Captain Tom
Drisdale, on a brig for a voyage to Ireland."

"I was in hopes your yarn had somethin' about
his runnin' away to go to sea," Jerry said in a
tone of disappointment.

"You'll find these 'ere runaway sailors don't
'mount to very much, except in story books, an',
besides, Josh Barney wasn't that kind of a chap.
Drisdale made the passage, an' then went up to
Liverpool, where he got a chance to sell the brig.
Barney worked his way home before the mast on
a full-rigged ship       I don't jest remember her
name. When he struck Baltimore again it
was to find that the old man Barney had been
killed accidentally by the youngest boy of the
family, who was foolin' with a loaded pistol, an'
Joshua had to shift for himself, seein's his father
didn't have none too much money, an' a big
family. The lad shipped for Cadiz as ordinary
seaman; made the voyage all right; had a little
cash to leave with his mother, an' then signed as
an A1 on a brig bound for Italy."

"It don't make very much difference to us how
many voyages he made," Jerry interrupted.
"What we want to know is the kind of a man he
is."

"If you can put a stopper on your jaw a bit,
you'll soon find out! The mate of the brig was[Pg 8]
sent into the forecastle, not bein' up to his work,
an' Josh Barney took his place. Then the captain
took sick, an' lo an' behold, before the lad
had turned sixteen years old, he was in command
of the brig. Owin' to the freights that offered,
he sailed for Alicant, an' made port just as the
Spaniards were fittin' out an expedition against
Algiers. The brig was chartered as transport,
an' he earned big money for the owners, gettin'
back to the mouth of the Chesapeake in '76, when
the British sloop of war King Fisher hove him
to an' took all his papers an' weapons; but let
him keep on to Baltimore, where the brig was
laid up. Then Barney had more money, an' considerable
of it, for his mother."

The old man paused to take in another cargo
of tobacco, and then continued:

"Young as he was, the lad found a chance to
ship as master's mate on the sloop Hornet, William
Stone commandin', an' in one day, so it's
said, he, carryin' a flag an' with a drummer an'
two fifers, enlisted a full crew for the Hornet, all
from Baltimore, which goes to show that the
people there thought he amounted to somethin'.
Barney sailed in Hopkins' fleet to the Bahamas,
where the town of New Providence was taken,
an' the commodore scooped in all the ammunition
to be found on the island. A little while after
that, he shipped on the schooner Wasp, which
convoyed off the coast the vessel in which Ben[Pg 9]jamin
Franklin was goin' to Europe to help pull
this country through, an' when they came back
into the Cape May channel they found the king's
ships Roebuck an' Liverpool       one of forty-four
guns an' the other of twenty-eight       waitin' for
'em. There was lively times for a spell, until
the Wasp contrived to slip into Wilmington
creek, where she laid till half a dozen row galleys
came down from Philadelphia to attack the
British ships. Then the schooner came out, an'
while the fightin' was goin' on, captured the brig
Tender, one of his majesty's armed vessels what
poked her nose in to help the big fellows. They
say Barney fought like a tiger, an' with his captain
wounded, brought the little schooner an' her
prize through the fog into port.

"Then they gave him a lieutenant's commission,
an' sent him off in the sloop Sachem, all of
which happened before he was seventeen years
old. He soon found a chance to fight, an' after
an action of two hours, captured an English
brig. After that they took the sloop Race Horse,
cuttin' her up so badly she sank, an' the next to
come their way was a snow from Jamaica, which
the lad counted on bringin' into port, he bein'
put on board as prize master. Then he had a bit
of bad luck; the snow was re-captured, an' Barney
made prisoner, as stands to reason; but he
was exchanged at Charleston, an' rode horseback
to Baltimore."[Pg 10]

"How do you happen to remember all these
things?" Jerry asked, thinking, perhaps, that
Darius was giving us more guff than truth.

"Remember it?" the old man repeated sharply.
"Why I've sailed with Captain Barney, an' every
mother's son of the crew knew the story, for it
ain't often that a lad of seventeen gets such a
record, so we couldn't help keepin' it in mind,
besides which, I've got lots of stuff in my pocket
that's been printed about him. Well, in '77 he
shipped on the Andrew Doria for the defense
of the Delaware River, an' when that scrimmage
was over, he found himself drafted to the frigate
Virginia, when, as everybody knows, he was
taken by the Britishers again, an' held for nearly
a year before bein' exchanged for the lieutenant
of the Mermaid. Then he went out in a letter
of marque       meanin' a privateer       with Captain
Robinson; they had but twelve guns, a mighty
small stock of powder, an' only thirty-five men,
but bless you those fellows thought nothin' of
tacklin' the British privateer Rosebud, full of
men an' guns. Forty-seven of the enemy were
killed or wounded, an' aboard the Yankee only
one was wounded. They sailed to Bordeaux, took
on a cargo of brandy, shipped seventy men,
mounted eighteen guns, an' on the voyage home
had a runnin' fight lastin' well on to two days,
when they captured their game.

"Then it was that Barney got married, an'[Pg 11]
about a month afterward, when drivin' in a gig
from Philadelphia to Baltimore, he was robbed of
every cent he had in the world. He never told
anybody of his loss; but turned back to Philadelphia,
took service aboard the Saratoga, sixteen
guns, an' made a big voyage, capturin' one
ship of twelve guns, another of thirty-two, an'
two brigs. Then he was taken by the Intrepid,
an' mighty barbarous treatment he got for well
on to a year, when the young officer escaped, an'
after he got home the government gave him command
of the Hyder Ally, with which he soon
took the British ship General Monk, as this 'ere
bit of paper will show."

Darius took from his pocket a well-worn slip
cut from some newspaper, which purported to
be an extract from the Hyder Ally log-book, and
as it was mighty interesting to me, I'm going
to set it down here just as it was printed.

"April 8th, 1782, at 10 A.M. laying at anchor
under Cape May (Delaware) discovered three
sail standing in from sea with a light wind from
the eastward; at 11 perceived that they were a
frigate, a ship, and an armed brig. At meridian
the frigate stood for Cape Henlopen channel,
the ship and brig standing in for Cape May; made
a signal for our convoy to get under weigh, and
followed the convoy. At 1 P.M. the ship and
brig came into the bay, by Cape May channel,
[Pg 12]the frigate coming around under Cape Henlopen;
prepared for action, all hands to quarters.

"At three-quarters past one, the brig passed
us, after giving us two fires; we reserved our
fire for the ship, then fast coming up; we received
very little damage from the brig, who stood after
our convoy; she mounted sixteen guns, and was
formerly the American privateer 'Fair American',
commanded by Captain Decatur, and equal
to us in force.

"At 2 P.M. the ship ranged up on our starboard
quarter, and fired two guns at us; we were
then at good pistol-shot; we then attempted to
run her on board, by laying her across the starboard
bow, but our yard-arms locked, which
kept us too far off to board; at the same time
poured in our broadside from great guns and
small arms.

"Our fire was briskly kept up for twenty-six
minutes, when she struck her colors. Immediately
sent our first lieutenant on board, and stood
up the bay, the frigate at this time under a press
of sail in chase after us, and the brig ahead in
chase of our convoy; again prepared for action,
and stood after the brig, but on her perceiving
that the ship had struck, she stood for the frigate,
and got aground; we were obliged to pass her,
as the frigate gained on us.

"At 4 P.M. the frigate came to anchor in the
bay, (supposed for want of a pilot.) We then
[Pg 13]spoke the prize for the first time, and learned
she was his Majesty's ship the General Monk,
Captain Rodgers, of nineteen nine-pounders, but
fighting twenty guns, and had on board, when
the action began, one hundred and thirty-six
men, of whom thirty were killed, and fifty-three
wounded. Of sixteen officers on board, fifteen
were killed or wounded. The captain received
three wounds.

"We had on board the Hyder Ally four killed
and eleven wounded. The Hyder Ally mounted
twelve six-pounders, and four nine-pounders,
with a complement of one hundred and fifteen
men. During the action we fired thirteen broadsides
from our cannon, and from sixty to seventy
rounds from our muskets.

"Proportion of metal: The General Monk ten
nine-pounders, fired ninety weight of shot at
one broadside. The Hyder Ally, six sixes and
two nines, fired fifty-four weight of shot at one
broadside. Proportion       fifty to ninety."

"That all came from the log-book, an' you'll
find Captain Barney didn't try to blow his own
horn," Darius said as I ceased reading. "But
I happened to go on board the General Monk
when she got into Philadelphia, an' saw the
killed an' wounded bein' brought ashore in hammocks.
The prize looked tough; her decks were
covered with blood, an' three of the bow ports[Pg 14]
were knocked into one. She was sold, bought in
by the government, an' Barney took command
of her, sailin' for France, with despatches to
Benjamin Franklin. Then the war came to an
end, an' he settled in Kentucky somewhere.
Here's a newspaper story of what happened after
that," and Darius gave me another slip of paper,
the matter on which I read aloud to Jerry, as
follows:

"In 1789 Captain Barney, finding his health
impaired by his services, embarked for Carthagena
in a small brig belonging to himself and
partner. Thence he went to Havana, and then
home. In 1792 he sailed again, and arrived at
Cape François. While there the town was burnt,
and he was obliged to fight his way. He brought
off fifty or sixty miserable women and children.
His vessel was captured by an English privateer
brig, two others in company. Three officers and
eleven men were put on board, and all the Americans
taken out except Barney, the carpenter,
boatswain and cook. They were ordered to New
Providence. The keys of the treasure chest were
demanded, but Barney would not deliver them,
which occasioned much abuse and ill treatment.
He had concealed a small blunderbuss, and his
men some other arms, with which they re-took
the ship. The Englishmen were made to work
the vessel until they arrived at Baltimore. Barney
was compelled, for his own safety, to sleep[Pg 15]
on the quarter-deck in an arm-chair. He again
sailed for Cape François in 1793; on his return,
he was again captured by an English brig, and
taken to Jamaica. When he arrived in Kingston
he was committed to prison, and bills were found
against him for piracy. His ship and cargo were
condemned. Once more he escaped, and on his
return was offered command of a frigate; but
declined. In 1795 he entered the French service,
remaining in that employ until 1800."

"Now you can see what kind of a man it is
who'll be in command here on the Chesapeake,"
Darius said triumphantly when I ceased reading.
"The Britishers won't find it all plain
sailin' while he's around, and I'm allowin' he'll
make things hum."

It pleased me to know that we would have a
live man to protect us, for if all the rumors were
to be credited, the time had come when we needed
protection mighty bad; but with all Darius' storytelling,
it never came into my mind that we
would know this wonderful Captain Barney, except
by hearsay.

We continued at our oyster business without
being troubled in any way by the war, although
small fights were going on all around us during
the early part of the summer.

More than once had we seen the flotilla under
command of this same Captain Barney, who was
come to be a commodore now. In it were twenty-[Pg 16]six
barges and pungies, with nine hundred men,
all of whom saw more of service from May to
July than they had ever dreamed of.

The commodore did indeed make things
"hum," as Darius had predicted. He attacked
anything and everything that was British, never
seeming to care one whit whether he was outclassed
or not, and succeeded in doing the enemy
a big lot of injury. It is well known that once,
during a full four hours, he kept his small fleet
under the fire of a frigate's guns, hoping to capture
her.

Then the Britishers began to understand that
if they wanted to have things their own way in
the Chesapeake, it would be necessary to first do
away with Commodore Barney, and they began
operations in great shape, although at the time
we who were most interested in that locality
had little idea of what was coming.

Now after this fleet of barges and pungies began
their work, Jerry seemed to have something
of import on his mind; but never a word would
he say in explanation to Darius and me, until
our business grew so dull that it was only with
great difficulty we could earn enough to pay the
running expenses, and then it was that the lad
came to the front with a scheme which he thought
great, while neither of us so much as dreamed of
what the carrying out would result in.

"It's no use freightin' oysters to Baltimore,[Pg 17]
when we can't sell 'em for enough to pay for the
use of the pungy, to say nothin' of our time in
dredgin'," Jerry began one afternoon about the
first of August, when we were coming down the
bay with our pockets nearly as empty as the
Avenger's hold.

"But we do get a dollar now an' then," I said
with a laugh, "which is more than could be done
if we turned idlers. Half a loaf is way ahead of
no bread at all."

Darius nodded gravely as if to show that he
agreed with me fully, and Jerry cried with more
of anger than good humor in his tones:

"But I'm countin' on havin' a bit of meat now
an' then. I could eat a razor-back this minute
without stoppin' to take off the bristles; but there
isn't money enough on board to buy the smallest
ham."

"How are you goin' to mend matters, lad,
while the price of oysters keeps down as it is
now?" Darius asked, beginning to understand
that Jerry had something in his head which might
serve us.

"I'm told that Commodore Barney keeps his
men jumpin' so lively at fightin' that they don't
have time for anythin' else," the lad said slowly,
as if speaking to himself, and I wondered if he
counted that the commodore could raise the price
of oysters.

"I reckon that's the straight truth," Darius[Pg 18]
replied. "It ain't his way to keep cats that don't
catch mice."

"Then why is it we can't make a trade to help
supply the commodore with fish an' oysters?
Even though he didn't give very much for the
freights we brought in, it wouldn't be a case of
losin' three or four days out of every ten runnin'
up to Baltimore."

Even then I failed to understand his scheme,
and said as much, whereat the lad cried impatiently:

"You must be thick-headed, Amos Grout, if
you can't see what I'm drivin' at. The matter
has been in my mind these two months past, so
now I propose that we go to Commodore Barney       he
surely will hear what we've got to say       , an'
try to make a trade. He buys more'n half of all
his provisions, for the men of the fleet don't get
time to do much fishin', an' we could let ourselves
an' the pungy outright, or agree upon a price for
what we bring in."

It wasn't at all a bad scheme, now that our
regular business was so dull; but I questioned if
the commodore would listen to such as we were,
long enough to understand what kind of a bargain
we had to offer.

"I'll go bail that you won't have any trouble
in gettin' speech with Joshua Barney, an' for so
long as the business warrants, pervidin' you can
catch him when he's got a few spare minutes on[Pg 19]
his hands," Darius said quickly, and from his
tone I understood that he heartily approved of
Jerry's scheme.

"But where shall we find the fleet?" I asked,
and to the question Jerry made answer:

"We've been countin' on runnin' in to see our
folks at Benedict, an' I warrant that there we'll
get news of the commodore. If not, it won't cost
so very much time to have a look around the lower
end of the bay."

"Yes, an' be snapped up by some bloomin'
Britisher," I said, having no desire to mix in
where people were fighting with such playful
weapons as cannon and rifles.

"We should be able to keep out of the way of
danger," Jerry replied, as if he had thought out
the whole scheme, and I then understood that he
had been mooning over it the past two months,
determined to spring it on us when the price of
oysters dropped below what would be decent
wages.

Well, we didn't come to any conclusion that
day, owing to my standing back and throwing
cold water; but we were bound to touch at the
home port, and Jerry bided his time until we
were where information regarding the fleet could
be had.



[Pg 20]
CHAPTER II.

AT BENEDICT.


I had not supposed that the people of Benedict
would know very much concerning what was going
on at the lower end of the bay; but the Avenger
was hardly more than at anchor when I understood
that we could have gone to no better place
in order to learn what was being done.

We had but just come to anchor, not having
time to set foot on the shore, when Jim Freeman
rowed over to us, his eyes bulging and every
freckle on his face standing out like pips on a
gooseberry.

"What did you put in here for?" he cried before
yet coming alongside. "Are you hankerin'
to have your pungy burned or sunk?"

"What's the matter, Jim?" Jerry cried.
"You're actin' like as if somethin' had gone
wrong!"

"Gone wrong?" Jim exclaimed, and it did
really look as if his eyes would roll right down
on his cheeks. "The whole bloomin' bottom has[Pg 21]
dropped out of everything. The Britishers are
comin' into the bay thicker'n spatter, an' I don't
see how you got in here without bein' caught!"

"In here?" I cried in amazement. "Have
you lost your wits that you think the Britishers
would come into the Patuxent river?"

"I reckon it's you that are needin' wits!" Jim
cried as he scrambled over the rail. "So you
think they wouldn't come into the Patuxent, eh?"

"Certainly not, and for the very good reason
that there's nothing here they want."

Jim looked at me in pity, and I afterward
understood that there was good reason for his so
doing.

"How long have you been up Baltimore way?"

"Near to ten days," Jerry replied, hoping to
hasten Jim in the telling of the news with which
he was near to bursting. "We had hard work to
sell our oysters at any price, an' then it fell a
dead calm with weather hot enough to tan a
nigger."

"Then there's little wonder that you boys
are way behind the times as to what has been
goin' on 'round here," and Jim threw out his
chest as he swelled with the importance of being
the first to impart startling news. "In the first
place," he said, speaking slowly as if to prolong
his enjoyment at giving information which would
not be pleasing to hear, "Admiral Cochrane, the
Britisher, has passed the capes with twenty-one[Pg 22]
vessels, an' Commodore Malcolm is below with
a fleet loaded with soldiers. Tom Harrison
swears there were more'n ten thousand men."

"Somebody has been stuffin' you, Jim," I said,
not crediting his news.

"Then they've stuffed Commodore Barney too,
an' when he runs I allow the rest of us had better
be huntin' a hole."

"Commodore Barney don't run!" Darius cried
angrily, for he never allowed anything disparaging
to be said in his presence of the man whom he
believed to be the greatest naval commander who
ever lived.

"Perhaps he don't very often; but he has this
time," Jim said in a tone so decided that we could
not but believe he was convinced of the truth of
his own words.

"Did you see him?" Darius demanded, and I
expected that when he answered this question
Jim's story would fall to pieces; but the lad replied
bold as a lion:

"Of course I did! All the boats laid here after
the fight in St. Leonard's bay, an' it was only
yesterday they scooted up the river!"

Here was news with a vengeance, and I no
longer felt the same desire to punch Jim's head
which had come over me when he first came
aboard with what I believed was a cock and bull
story.

Then, with first one and another asking ques[Pg 23]tions,
we learned from Jim that while we were in
Baltimore the British frigate Loire had chased
Commodore Barney's flotilla into St. Leonard's
bay, and blockaded it there until Colonel Carberry's
artillery came down from Frederick and
drove the enemy away.

Then, having learned of the enormous force at
the mouth of the bay, Commodore Barney sailed
to Benedict, where he remained four and twenty
hours, or till word was brought that ten or twelve
of the enemy's vessels were bound up the bay,
bound most likely for Baltimore or Washington,
when he sailed for Nottingham, further up the
river.

Darius was more concerned than either of us,
for he firmly believed that Joshua Barney would
not have beaten a retreat without first having
been positive that an overwhelming force was
near at hand, and if there were Britishers near
enough to drive the commodore away, we had got
ourselves in a pickle by coming up the river.

The first thought which came to my mind was
that the Avenger was in great danger of being
captured in short order, for I made no question
but that the enemy would pursue Barney, and
we were where we could not escape, save by way
of the bay.

Jerry, however, had the idea that all these
man[oe]uvres would further his scheme, and he[Pg 24]
said as if being thoroughly well satisfied with the
situation:

"We can run up to Nottingham, as well as
the commodore, and once there I reckon it will
be possible to make our trade."

"But if the fleet is forced to remain there, all
hands will be idle, and the commodore won't care
to hire us while several hundred men are loafing
around the decks," I suggested, and Jerry's jaw
fell.

But Jim had not exhausted his budget of news,
although it was impossible for him to give us anything
more very startling.

"The commodore had only got eight pungies
an' five barges of the fleet       "

"Where are the other boats?" Darius demanded
sharply.

"Somewhere on the Delaware side; they went
off on a cruise before the Britishers hove in sight.
He has taken on the schooner Scorpion, which
was here at anchor, an' I heard one of the officers
say that there was about five hundred men in this
part of the fleet."

"I'm goin' ashore," Darius said abruptly. "It
ain't no ways certain to me that Jim has heard
this thing right, an' I count on gettin' down to
facts."

Jerry and I were eager to land, and, without
even stopping to thank Jim for the news he[Pg 25]
brought, we went over the rail into our canoe,
pulling in hot haste for the shore.

Never waiting to speak with such few loungers
as were to be seen near the water front, I went
directly to my own home, and there found more
tidings of war.

My father had joined Commodore Barney, as
had nearly all the able-bodied men of Benedict,
agreeing to remain in service while our section of
the country was menaced by the enemy, and
mother seemed to have the idea that I would follow
his example.

Jerry's father had gone with the fleet, and, as
she said, only those who had been opposed to the
war with England, remained at home. After
greeting me, and telling what little she knew of
the situation, mother set about getting together
the few things I owned which might be needed on
a long cruise, and I was ashamed to say that as
yet I had had no idea of going to fight the Britishers.

Don't let it be understood I believed the United
States could have done other than declare war
in 1812, or that I had any secret liking for the
Britishers. I simply believed that I did not have
the backbone of a fighter, and preferred to stand
at a distance while the more eager went ahead;
but yet I was not really a coward, as I think was
afterward proved.

However, just then it made me feel rather un[Pg 26]comfortable
to have mother gathering up my few
belongings, and telling me what to do in event of
receiving such or such a wound, and, with my
brain all in a whirl, I went out of doors under
the pretense that it was necessary I should have
a talk with Darius and Jerry.

Once alone by myself, behind the corn-crib
where no one would be likely to see me, I tried to
sum up the situation so far as I was immediately
concerned, and it did not look cheering. We had
sailed the Avenger down the bay and up the river
never sighting a single craft, although it appeared
that the British were swarming near
about our very course. It was not probable we
could run to the southward without coming
across some of their vessels, especially if they
were reckoning on pursuing Commodore Barney,
and even though we did get to the mouth of the
river in safety, where could we go? The big fleets
were at the entrance of the bay, and had not come
there for nothing; the enemy was counting on
attacking Washington or Baltimore, it seemed
certain, and by going to the northward we would
likely find ourselves out of the frying-pan into the
fire.

It seemed very much to me as if we had lost
the Avenger, whichever way we turned, and
my heart grew heavy, for once she was gone
Jerry and I were badly off.

Hardly knowing what I did, I went toward my[Pg 27]
friend's home, and met him coming my way, a
look of excitement and eagerness on his face.

"Well, it seems as if we were in for it!" he
cried when we were come within hailing distance,
and I asked irritably:

"In for what?"

"A bit of fightin', of course. You wouldn't be
willin' to stay here with the cowards Commodore
Barney left behind, would you?"

"There are a good many things I had rather
do than poke my nose into a hornet's nest," I
replied, feeling as if Jerry was in some way my
enemy because he appeared to be so delighted
with the situation.

"What did your mother say?" he asked, giving
no heed to my grumpiness.

"Nothing much; she is getting things ready
for me to go away, and without so much as asking
if I counted on leaving."

"She knows, as I do, that you wouldn't remain
behind," the lad cried, showing as much
joy as if we were thinking of visiting a peepshow.
"Come on; Darius is waitin' for us. We
must try to get a supply of provisions, for it's
likely they haven't any too large a store in the
fleet."

Then was the moment when I should have declared
bluntly that I had no idea of putting myself
in a position to be shot at if it could be
avoided; but I hadn't the courage to tell him that[Pg 28]
I would not leave Benedict immediately, although
I was fully determined not to go up the river.

Jim Freeman and a couple of other boys
strolled along, having been in search of us. They
also took it for granted that the Avenger would
join Commodore Barney's fleet, and were come to
ask that the three be allowed to go with us.

"It won't do, Jim," Jerry said, taking it upon
himself to act as spokesman, although I figured
as captain of the pungy. "We can't feed ourselves,
the way things look now, an' it don't stand
to reason we should add to the crew."

"But I'll bring enough to eat," Jim persisted,
and turned to me as he said, "I've done you many
a good turn, Amos, an' you won't lose anything
by givin' me lift now."

"Do you call it a lift to be put where the
Britishers can kill you?" I asked angrily, for
if these lads were so eager to have a hand in the
fighting as to beg for a chance, it would be all
the harder for me to declare that I wouldn't join
the fleet.

"We might carry you as far as Nottingham, if
you'd agree to ship on some other craft after we
got there," Jerry said without stopping to ask
my permission.

"That we'll do, an' be glad of the chance,"
Jim replied, acting as if really overjoyed by the
permission to run his nose into danger. "We'll[Pg 29]
be on board in half an hour; you can't get under
way before then?"

"No; we shall likely be here an hour or more,"
Jerry said as if he was the sole owner of the Avenger,
and when the foolish boys ran away at full
speed, he began to figure as to where we could get
a small store of food.

I held my peace, angry and timorous, until we
were come to the water front, where we found
Darius awaiting us, and he, as could be seen at a
glance, was of the same mind as Jerry.

"I've found two hams an' a side of bacon!"
he cried triumphantly, pointing to the articles
which were in the canoe. "If you fellows can
scare up some meal, we'll be fixed for a spell.
Did you see Jim Freeman an' his crowd?"

"Yes; they're goin' to Nottingham with us,"
Jerry replied, and the old man asked me:

"How soon can we get under way?"

I hesitated; it was on the tip of my tongue to
say that I would not stir a hand in the matter,
nor should the Avenger leave her moorings; but,
fortunately, I remembered that we couldn't hold
the pungy there to be destroyed when the enemy
came up the river, and, to tell the absolute truth,
I was ashamed to declare bluntly that I had no
idea of casting in my lot with such a firebrand
as Commodore Barney.

"We ought to leave here in an hour," Jerry
said, making answer because he thought I was[Pg 30]
trying to figure how long it would take us to
make ready. "Amos won't need more than ten
minutes to get what stuff his mother is puttin' up
for him, an' I'm goin' round by the mill to see if
they will trust us for half a bushel of meal."

He was off like an arrow as he spoke, and
Darius had no idea that I was hesitating as to
the course to pursue, for an old fighter like him
supposed it would be a pleasure for me to voluntarily
go into the worst kind of a row.

It was fortunate indeed for me that the old man
never suspected what was in my heart, otherwise
I would have been shamed in my home to such an
extent that I could never go there again; but all
that came to mind later. Just then I felt as if I
was being cruelly wronged by those who should
have stood my friends.

Darius would have told me yet further of what
Commodore Barney had done in the past; but I
cut him short by saying like a spoiled child:

"I don't care to hear anything more about him;
just now it strikes me that we'd better be thinking
of ourselves."

The old man looked really distressed, and but
for the fact that my heart was sore, I could have
laughed because of the mistake he made. Darius
really believed that I was grieving over being
thus obliged to leave my mother and the children,
and he said soothingly:

"I come somewhere near knowin' how it is, lad.[Pg 31]
At such a time as this the least home talk that's
made, the better, for it kind'er unstrings a fellow.
You wait here, an' I'll go after what dunnage
your mother is gettin' together; she'll understand
that a short partin' is the best."

I could not have stopped him, for he was off
before I had time to so much as open my mouth,
and there I stood leaning against the canoe, giving
the people of Benedict to believe I was eager
to be fighting for my country.

Jim Freeman and his companions came along
a few moments after Darius left, and in order to
have some occupation, rather than from a desire
to serve them, I offered to put the three aboard
the Avenger.

They talked of nothing but what they would
do once the enemy gave them an opportunity,
until I asked petulantly:

"Is everybody in Benedict as eager to shed
blood as are you?"

"Not much," Jim cried with a laugh. "There's
Elias Macomber, for example       he's an Englishman,
you know, an' hasn't been in this country
more'n four years. He's makin' a lot of wild talk
'bout what he'll do to us folks when the Britishers
come up the river."

"What reason has he to make any fuss?"
I asked, rather for the sake of saying something,
than because I desired information.

"Well, I suppose all hands have roughed into[Pg 32]
him pretty bad, on account of things he's said, an'
now he counts on showin' what his countrymen
can do."

Now it was that I began to feel glad because of
having said nothing in opposition to joining Commodore
Barney's fleet. By hanging back while
all the others were taking up arms, I would be
ranging myself on the side of Elias Macomber,
which would have caused me to be ashamed of
myself, for he was by no means a reputable citizen.

However glad I might be because I had refrained,
or been prevented, from saying that
which would have made it appear as if I took
sides with the British, I was in nowise reconciled
to the idea of going where the bullets were like
to be flying, and, after putting Jim and his friend
aboard the Avenger, I pulled back to the shore
in anything rather than a cheerful frame of mind.

Darius was waiting for me, and he must have
run every step of the way from the river to my
father's home. He had with him a small bundle
wrapped in one of mother's blankets, and said as
he pulled the bow of the canoe up on the mud:

"I reckon it is jest as well that I went after
your dunnage, lad, for your mother was ready to
have a cryin' fit, which she couldn't perlitely let
come on while I was there; but I'll warrant the
water would have run had you been alone with
her."[Pg 33]

"She can't be feeling terribly bad, otherwise
she wouldn't have been so anxious to have me go,"
I said sulkily.

"I don't know about that, my boy. It stands
to reason she had rather anything else happened,
than that you should stay at home when this part
of the country needs every hand that can be raised
in defense. She feels sore because you are goin';
but I'll go bail she'd have felt ten times worse
had you said you'd stay back with such as Elias
Macomber."

I wasn't in a proper frame of mind to appreciate
all that the old man said, and continued to
consider myself as being abused, although not to
such an extent as before I heard about Elias Macomber.

It was noised around in the village, told most
likely by Jim Freeman, that we were going to
Nottingham to join the commodore, and while
Darius and I stood by the canoe waiting for Jerry,
we were literally besieged by women, whose husbands
or sons were with the fleet, nearly all of
whom wanted to send some message, or this or
that article which had been forgotten at the time
of departure.

I believe of a verity that Darius and I charged
ourselves with no less than twenty errands by
word of mouth, and as for packages, why we had
the bow piled full, until it seemed as if we were[Pg 34]
to carry something by way of reminder for every
man under Commodore Barney's command.

Near-by where we stood were also gathered
four men whose sympathies were entirely with
the British, and among them, as a matter of
course, was Elias Macomber.

These worthless ones who would injure the
country which had provided them with a home,
food and clothing, to say nothing of the comforts
of life, evidently counted on ruffling our feathers,
believing it would be safe to do so now that nearly
all the men were gone from the village, and they
began by talking loudly of the sorry spectacle
which the commodore and his followers would
present when Admiral Cochrane and his vessels
came up the river.

I feel certain that Darius would have held his
peace, for he was not naturally a quarrelsome
man, had they made sport of everybody in the
American army and navy, save Joshua Barney;
but a word against him was to the old man much
as a red flag is to a bull, and in a twinkling the
trouble began.

"The man who says aught against the commodore
must answer to me for his words," Darius
said angrily as he strode toward the four who
were trying to bait him. "I'll not stand here and
listen to such talk!"

It was Elias Macomber who showed his lack
of sound sense by making reply:[Pg 35]

"We didn't ask you to stand here; but if you
choose to do so, it's more than likely you'll hear
a good many things which may not please you."

"Hold your tongue as to Barney, or it'll be the
worse for all hands!" Darius cried angrily, and
at that moment Jerry appeared, staggering under
a bag which must have contained a full bushel
and a half of meal.

I shall always believe Elias Macomber held the
idea that Darius was a feeble old man, otherwise
he would have kept his tongue between his teeth,
for he was far from being brave; but however
that may be, he replied hotly:

"I do not count on choosin' my words when I
speak of such a bag of wind as Josh Barney has
shown himself to be!"

It seemed to me as if the words had not been
fully spoken before Darius launched out, and, in,
less time than it takes to tell it, was in the midst
of a hot, one-sided fight, for the Tories all pitched
into him, regardless of the fact that his quarrel
was with Elias.

It stands to reason that I could never remain
idle while a shipmate was getting the worst of
it, particularly when his adversaries were men
for whom I entertained no friendly feelings, and
the scrimmage was hardly more than begun when
I took a hand, standing close by the old man's
side.

As I aimed a blow at Elias I saw, out of the[Pg 36]
tail of my eye, Jerry drop his meal as he came
forward at full speed, and at almost the same
moment a loud splashing in the water caused me
to glance quickly in the direction of the pungy.

Jim Freeman had jumped overboard to do his
share toward teaching Macomber a lesson, and
when he arrived the odds would be even.

Of course it was a disgraceful spectacle; but
it could not have been avoided, so far as I was
concerned, and I did my best, fighting as vigorously
as if I had been the one to urge upon my
companions the necessity of joining the fleet.

It is not well that I give too much space to this
brawl when there are so many other adventures,
in which a fellow might well take pride, to be recorded,
therefore I will only say that we had no
very easy task to down these admirers of King
George and the Prince Regent; but finally succeeded,
thanks to the assistance of Jim Freeman.

It is doubtful which side got the worst drubbing,
although we claimed a victory because the
others ran; but positive it is that the four of us
had all the punishment needed, and were forced
to wash our faces more than once before we could
look at each other without a certain feeling of
shame.

"What made you tackle the whole of 'em?"
Jerry asked the old man. "If the rest of us
hadn't been near at hand, they'd wiped you out."

"I'd tackle twenty if they dared say anything[Pg 37]
against Joshua Barney!" Darius cried as he
shook his fist in the direction where our adversaries
had last been seen. "I'd rather get the
toughest pummellin' such as them could give,
than keep my mouth shut while they was slurrin'
their betters!"

We were actually obliged to use force with him,
otherwise the old man would have gone in pursuit
of the British-lovers, and it was only by
tumbling him into the canoe head-foremost, holding
him down by sitting on him once he was there,
that we could make Darius listen to anything like
reason.

"Let up on me, an' I'll keep quiet," he said
after we had threatened to continue the drubbing
begun by the Tories; "but this much I promise,
that after the commodore has made shoestrings
of that conceited admiral, I'll come back here an'
have it out with Elias Macomber."

"We'll let it go at that," Jerry said as he released
his hold of Darius and went back for the
meal, while Jim wrung the water out of his clothing
as best he could, for the fellow had not
stopped to throw off coat or shoes when he jumped
overboard to take a hand in the scrimmage.

It was near to half an hour before we were
ready to go on board the Avenger, and by that
time it was too late to make any protests against
following the commodore.

My comrades took it for granted that I was[Pg 38]
equally eager with them to be where I could do
my share of fighting the Britishers, and so stirred
up was I by the game of fisticuffs ashore that I
actually forgot to be frightened by the prospect
of taking part in a battle.

We got our anchor and made sail on the
Avenger without delay, and thus, in less than an
hour from the time of making port, we were off
again on what proved to be a series of wild adventures.



[Pg 39]
CHAPTER III.

ELIAS MACOMBER.


Of a verity Elias Macomber did me a good
turn when he started the quarrel with Darius
Thorpe, for up to this time I had been sadly lacking
in patriotism, as may have been learned
from that which is already set down in these
pages.

Until this day it had been as if the war did not
concern me or mine, save as it affected the price
of oysters, and when I saw this lad or the other
who had enlisted, I said to myself that another
foolish one had been found who willingly engaged
to go where he might be killed.

Within a very few moments after the fight between
Elias Macomber and his crew of British-lovers
had come to an end, I began to view the
situation of affairs as an honest lad should.

The country which protected me in my home       that
territory which had been bought, or redeemed,
by the blood of brave men, and even of
women and children, from the savage Indians
and a merciless king, was in danger, and if I did[Pg 40]
not rush to its defense how might I expect my
heritage of a free land could be preserved to me
and those who came after me?

Like a picture I saw before me those brave men
and women who had battled against the forces
of nature as they made homes in the wilderness;
then struggled against the bloodthirsty Indians
to protect their little all, and were finally called
upon to fight a powerful nation in order to hold
themselves free in the land already redeemed by
sweat and blood.

Once that was presented to my mental vision
I ceased to regret having been forced to thus set
off for the purpose of joining Commodore Barney's
fleet, and rejoiced that my comrades had
prevented me from showing the white feather
when even my loving mother urged me forward.
I forgot all the fears which had assailed me, and
thought only of what it might be possible for me
to do in order to show myself worthy the land of
my birth.

In a word, I had in a few seconds been transformed
from a cowardly lad who would shirk
his duty lest, perchance, he receive some bodily
hurt, to a boy burning with the desire to do whatsoever
lay in his power toward checking the advance
of an enemy who was bent upon carrying
on the war by destroying the property of peaceful
settlers.

Unless my comrades read what I have here set[Pg 41]
down, they will never know how near I was on
that day at Benedict, to proving myself a false-hearted
American lad.

The afternoon was considerably more than half
spent when we left home for the eighteen-mile
sail up the river, and I saw little chance of our
coming upon the fleet before morning, unless we
kept the pungy under sail far into the night, for
the breeze, what little we had of it, came from
the westward, and we could not make more than
two miles an hour against the current.

Therefore it was that I said to Darius when we
were half an hour or more from port, after Jim
Freeman and his friends had wearied themselves
by cutting monkey-shines on the deck in order
to prove their joy at thus having an opportunity
to do whatsoever they might in defense of their
country:

"With so light a wind we are like to be forced
aground when it is so dark that we cannot give
the shoals a wide berth, because of not seeing
them," and the old man replied, saying that
which was in my own mind:

"It'll be a case of comin' to anchor, lad, after
the sun has set, for we had best make haste slowly
rather than jam the pungy up where a day may
be spent in tryin' to float her."

"But suppose the British are close at hand?"
I asked, for now I was hot with the desire to make
certain of keeping so far ahead of the enemy that[Pg 42]
I could take part in whatsoever might be done
by way of fighting.

"They will be more helpless than we, after
night has come, for we know the river fairly well,
while they are strangers to it."

If it had not been that we lads were about to
take part in the war I might have refused to accept
Darius' advice so readily, for, it must be confessed,
I am overly headstrong and apt to go contrary
when one makes the least show of driving
me; but in the business we were about to embark
upon, I knew it was safe to follow the old man,
since he had had long experience in such matters,
the telling of which would be more entertaining
than will be the account of our adventures.

It was destined, however, that the Avenger
should come to anchor even before the river was
shrouded in darkness, for we were not more than
four miles above our own town of Benedict, when
the wind, died away completely, thus forcing us to
make fast somewhere, unless we were minded to
drift back to our starting point.

In my ignorance, I would have anchored the
pungy in the stream, hoisting a riding light, and
turned in feeling that everything was safe and
snug; but to this Darius made decided objection.

"Keep out of the channel," he said emphatically.
"We know beyond a peradventure that
the enemy is astern of us, and there is no tellin'
when he may come       "[Pg 43]

"He will wait for wind before goin' very far
up the river," I interrupted, and thus showed
my ignorance of anything concerning warfare,
for the old man replied:

"It wouldn't be strange if he should send a
boat in the night to make certain of the water,
and get such other information as might be useful.
This 'ere pungy would be captured by half
a dozen men as easily as if the whole British fleet
was close by."

"Are you of the opinion that we should haul
in to the bank?" I asked very humbly, understanding
that if we would run safely it might be
better to give Darius the command.

"Let her drop back beyond the point, an' then
sneak in as far among the trees as her spars will
permit," he said, and this we did, pulling her
around by aid of the canoe until we were nicely
hidden from all save by closest scrutiny.

Right glad was I by this time that Jim Freeman
and his two friends had come aboard, for
they were willing lads, who strove to do all they
might in the way of work, and we who belonged
on the Avenger had an easy time of it.

Jim took it upon himself to get supper, and he
had brought with him such a tempting store of
provisions, all of which he turned over to the
party, that our meal that night was a veritable
feast. I had never but once before had such an
appetizing repast, and that one exception was[Pg 44]
when oysters were scarce, and a Baltimore dealer
gave us a dinner at the hotel in addition to the
regular price of the cargo.

When our hunger had been satisfied, and the
cuddy put to rights, we lads would have spent
the time spinning yarns, or in some other such
amusement; but Darius put his foot down
strongly against it.

"Remember that you are liable to be made
prisoners of war at any moment," he said gravely.
"Wise men do not hide themselves and their vessel,
an' then talk and laugh that strangers may
know where they are hidden."

"Do you really expect to see Britishers on the
river this night?" Jim Freeman asked with a
laugh, and, much to my surprise, the old man said
emphatically:

"I surely do, if all we heard at Benedict be
true, an' I have little doubt of it. The enemy
count on destroyin' Commodore Barney's fleet,
an' know that it can be found up this stream. It
will be strange, 'cordin' to what I know of such
business, if the admiral does not send out spies
before shovin' any armed vessels up here."

It can well be supposed that such talk as this
insured silence among us; we had hardly begun
to understand that we might be very near a
British prison unless every precaution was taken;
but the old man's words, and manner of speaking[Pg 45]
them, brought us to a better realization of the
situation.

We almost held our breath, fancying the enemy
might be close aboard, until Darius, talking in a
whisper, said:

"I'm countin' on seein' or hearin' the Britishers
'twixt now an' mornin', an' it strikes me
that we might do a good stroke of work for
Joshua Barney, by lookin' after a prisoner or two.
It wouldn't be no ways strange if we could nab
'em, pervidin' they put themselves in a fair position
to be taken."

I was dumfounded by such a proposition, and
it is not impossible that my knees began to shake
as I thought of attempting such a thing. Then
I suddenly remembered that we had no weapons
aboard, except an old musket which we used to
shoot into a flock of ducks now and then, and I
said with a laugh:

"Do you expect that the Britishers will surrender
if we simply invite them? Our one musket
wouldn't make much of a showin' against a boat-load
of men."

"All that has been in my mind, lad, an' I
reckon it won't be hard to put ourselves in right
good shape. If any British spies count on comin'
up the river, it wouldn't be till after dark, an'
we've got no right to expect they'd be around this
way much before midnight. Now I'll paddle back
to the village, an' see if I can't scare up two or[Pg 46]
three muskets. It won't take me more'n an hour
for the whole job."

Darius said this as if asking advice; but I could
make no reply, and my companions held their
peace, therefore, after waiting a few moments
without hearing any comment, the old man set
about carrying his plan into execution.

Noiselessly he hauled the canoe alongside, went
over the rail into her, and took up the paddle, as
I stood near the bow waiting for his command to
cast off the painter.

"Keep quiet, whatever happens, an' don't fuss
if I'm kept quite a spell, for if there's anythin'
to be learned, I shall make mighty little account
of time. Cast off, lad, an' be certain that nothin'
goes up or down the river without your seeing it."

I obeyed the command, and in an instant the
canoe glided into the obscurity of the shadows
cast by the overhanging trees.

With the disappearance of Darius there came
upon me the full sense of my responsibility, for I
was the one to whom the others would look in
event of trouble, and I knew full well how poorly
fitted I was by experience to be in command of
the pungy.

The knowledge of my own short-comings at
least served one good turn, since it made me more
than usually cautious, and without delay I set
about preparations for obeying the command
given by Darius.[Pg 47]

All my companions were on deck, and calling
them aft to the cuddy companion-way, I said in a
whisper:

"You heard the words of Darius. Now I propose
the work shall be done in this fashion: All
hands will remain on duty, not in a group, but
stationed equal distances apart at the rail, each
one to watch and listen to the best of his ability.
No fellow shall speak with his neighbor, nor can
he move about lest the sound of footsteps on the
deck give an alarm."

Then I took up my station near the stern, and
in the gloom I could see the forms of my companions
while they ranged themselves as I had
suggested, neither of them making more noise
than so many mice.

From that moment not a sound could be heard
from the deck of the Avenger. That which Darius
said had aroused us all to the danger, and even
though we had only a crew of lads, I felt confident
no blunder would be charged against us.

It was dreary work waiting there in the darkness,
listening intently for the lightest unusual
noise, and believing that an enemy was, or soon
would be, close at hand. The gurgling of the
water in an eddy; the leap of a fish, or a bit of
drift-wood striking against the side of the pungy,
sounded in our ears loud as thunder, and we
heard the ordinary night rustlings of the forest
as if it was something strange to our ears.[Pg 48]

Then came that which caused us to bend far
out over the rail, trying to pierce the gloom with
our eyes, for the measured stroke of oars could
be heard, and it was a positive relief to me, even
though it betokened the coming of strangers.

I felt certain an enemy's boat was approaching,
because had any one living on the river been coming
up at that time of night, paddles would have
been used instead of oars. I knew of no one nearabout
Benedict who would have rowed a boat
against the current when she could have been
handled so much more readily the other way.

Nearer and nearer came the splashing of water,
as if more than one oarsman was at work, and
when it seemed as if the boat must be close upon
us, I heard a low voice, but could not distinguish
the words.

Immediately the noise of the oars ceased, and
then came the words, not loud, but clear enough
for us who were listening so intently to hear with
reasonable distinctness:

"On which side of the river were we to pick the
man up?"

"The left, sir; the same side as the village."

The Avenger was lying near the right bank of
the river, such position having been taken because
of the trees, and not through good judgment.

"One of you men get ashore, and see what can
be found. If this is the place agreed upon, and[Pg 49]
he said he would be about three miles above the
village, there should be a road running on a line
with the river."

There was no question in my mind but that
the speakers were Britishers from one of the
fleets, and that some of our people had agreed to
play the traitor by giving information, or piloting
the boat. But, if such was the case, where was
Darius? He had not had time to reach Benedict
before this boat came past there, and might already
be a prisoner on his way to the nearest
English vessel.

Even though he had gained the village while
the strangers were yet below it, then was his
danger the greater, for he might unwittingly come
directly upon them when he returned. Whichever
way I looked at the matter I saw cause for
grave fear, and the perspiration came out in big
drops on my forehead, for without him we would
be in a bad predicament.

While these thoughts were running through
my mind I gave due attention to what might be
going on at the opposite side of the river, for I
was convinced that the boat was nearly in
a straight line across from where we lay.

I could hear such noises as told that one of the
crew was scrambling ashore amid the underbrush,
and I heard a man cough; but after that all was
still until at least fifteen minutes were passed,
when there was a faint sound of voices from a dis[Pg 50]tance,
and then the rustling of the foliage as if
one or more was forcing a passage through the
tangle of vines.

"Hello!" came in a hoarse whisper from the
boat, and some one ashore replied:

"It's all right, sir."

From what could be heard I knew that a man,
or men, were making their way to the boat from
the highway, and then, when it seemed as if he or
they were aboard, the voice which had given the
command, said in greeting:

"So you're come at last, Macomber. I had
begun to believe we were mistaken as to the rendezvous."

"I was delayed in the village, for your orders
were that I must get away without its being
known, and there are many inquisitive ones in
Benedict."

My heart gave a great bound. So it was Elias
Macomber who was playing traitor, for even
though he was born in England, the United
States was his home by adoption, and to our
people he was bound in honor.

If Darius could only get weapons so that we
might capture the boat's crew, what joy would be
mine to carry the base hound to Commodore
Barney as a prisoner!

Elias was speaking in a low tone and rapidly
to some one       whom I had no doubt was a British
officer       , and I could only catch a word here and[Pg 51]
there; but it was enough to let me know that he
was reporting all he had heard concerning the
movements of the flotilla.

"At Nottingham yesterday," I heard. "Thirteen
barges an' pungies, with the schooner Scorpion.
Five hundred men all told. Well armed,
an' knowin' how to use their weapons."

It was by such fragments of conversation as
set down above that I knew Elias Macomber was
giving all the information in his power to the
enemy, and I resolved that some day he should
pay the penalty of the crime, even though I was
forced to pursue him single-handed.

When all the story had been told the officer
asked:

"Can you give us a place on the river where
we may lay by during the day? I am minded to
have a look at the boats before going back to
make report."

I bent forward eagerly to hear the reply:

"At a mill, five miles above here, you will find
a friend by name of Essek Harland. He can
give you all that may be needed."

"You shall go with us to make certain he takes
us in."

"Very well, sir; but in that case I cannot get
back home before morning."

"You should be able to pull eight miles with
a current in a few hours, and I will pay for the
hire of a boat."[Pg 52]

"Very well, sir," Macomber replied in a tone
of content, and I laughed inwardly with joy, for
he would be our prisoner to a certainty if he came
down the river alone.

Then the word was given for the oarsmen to
resume their work, and we heard the light splashing
of water as the boat was pulled up-stream.

After that all was silent once more, and Jerry
came tip-toeing aft to whisper in my ear:

"Do you think Darius managed to give them
the slip, or did they capture him?"

"It seems to me that the officer would have told
Elias if he had taken a prisoner," I replied, and
such fact gave me great satisfaction. "At all
events he must be here soon if nothing has
happened to his disadvantage."

Even as I spoke the canoe came out of the
shadow, gliding lightly and noiselessly as thistledown,
and we knew that Darius was safe, for
the time being at least.

"Did you run across the boat when you went
down?" I asked in a whisper as he came over
the rail, and he stood silent as if with surprise.

"Didn't you see a boat?" Jerry asked impatiently,
and the old man replied:

"I met with nothing either goin' or comin' an'
I've brought back two muskets with a mighty
small lot of powder an' ball; but it's better'n
nothin'. What do you mean by a boat?"

Then we told him what we had heard, and when[Pg 53]
I mentioned the name of the traitor, he brought
his hand down on his leg with a resounding
thwack that might have been heard some distance
away, as he said incautiously loud:

"We'll have that snake, lads, if we don't do
anythin' more, an' he shall have a chance to see
how the commodore looks when the Britishers
come up the river!"

"Then it is for you to take command of the
Avenger, Darius. The boat has not been gone
from here above ten minutes, therefore it is likely
to be some time before the traitor comes down
stream."

"We won't wait here for him, lads. There's
breeze enough stirrin' now to send the pungy
against the current, an' we'll push ahead."

Sheltered by the trees as the vessel had been,
we were ignorant of the fact that a night breeze
was springing up, until the Avenger swung out
into the stream, and then we found it as Darius
had said.

The little craft could make about two miles
an hour against the current, which, as I reckoned,
was about what the boat could do with a couple
of men at the oars, and I suggested to the old
man that there was danger we might over-run
our game.

He gave heed by sending all hands, save me,
into the bow as lookouts, and steered a zig-zag
course, which reduced our speed a full third.[Pg 54]

"I don't believe I've ever heard of this Essek
Harland you tell about," the old man said to me
in a whisper, and, understanding that he desired
all the information I could give concerning the
miller, I replied:

"He's of much the same kidney as Elias Macomber,
except that he was born in this country.
A mean native of North Carolina, who starves
his slaves, and makes them work twice as many
hours as they should. He runs the mill, and it
is said that all those who carry grist to him keep
a sharp watch lest he take out too much toll. If
he hides the Britishers, or gives them any information,
it will be because they pay him, for he
will do any mean thing for money."

"Have you ever heard it said whether he was
for or against the war?"

"No, and I haven't heard his name spoken for
a year or more. It would make little difference
with him which side he was on, if the opposite
party offered money they could buy him."

Then we fell silent again during half an hour
or more, when Darius said:

"You shall tell me when we are within a mile
of the mill; it won't be safe to run any nearer
unless we have overhauled that snake of a Macomber."

I was so well acquainted with the river as to
know every crook and turn for at least ten miles
above Benedict, and when it seemed certain the[Pg 55]
pungy had run three miles or more, I kept a
sharp look-out on the banks in order to comply
with the old man's request.

It was just when I believed we were close upon
the spot where the Avenger should be stopped,
that Jerry came tip-toeing aft, waving his arms
to attract our attention.

"Macomber has hove in sight!" Darius whispered.
"Take the tiller, an' head her for his
canoe!"

As he spoke he darted into the cuddy, returning
a few seconds later with two muskets, and
these he carried with him well forward.

I strained my eyes in vain for a view of the
canoe, which should be coming right fast, with a
favoring current, and had not yet made her out
when Darius hailed:

"In the boat there! Whereabouts are our
people?"

The old man had disguised his voice, and the
traitor must have believed that we were a party of
British coming to join those whom he had piloted,
for he paddled alongside fearlessly, as he replied:

"Up the river half a mile or so."

"Can you show us the way?"

"Ay, that I can; but it will delay me in       "

He ceased speaking very suddenly, for at that
moment Jerry incautiously came toward the port
rail, and even though the night was dark, it was
possible to see that he was neither a British soldier
nor sailor.[Pg 56]

Quickly he seized the paddle to shove off; but
Darius thrust the muzzle of a musket in his very
face, as he cried sharply:

"Pass up your painter, or I'll shoot! Quick,
or your life is gone in another second!"

Elias Macomber was a coward, as we knew full
well, but I never believed he would give in quite
as readily as he did. He passed up the painter
as meekly as any cooing dove, and when Darius
ordered him to come over the rail, he made all
haste to obey the command.

When we gathered around the cur, however,
for all of us were so eager that we could not keep
out of sight any longer, and he saw who had captured
him, he let go a cry of anger that was like
unto the whoof of a bear, as he struck out with
both fists savagely.

He would have showed better sense had he
taken matters with a bit more grace, for before
he could land a blow on either of us, Darius
floored him with the butt-end of the musket, and
during a minute or two he laid like one dead.

"You struck too hard!" I cried in alarm, for
even though the man was a traitor, it seemed
terrible to take a human life.

"Not a bit of it," the old sailor said quietly as
he set about lashing the fellow's arms and legs.
"He ain't the kind that can be killed so easily.
Get off the hatch, for we must have him out of
sight before coming up to the mill."



      Pass up your painter, or I     ll shoot!       Cried Darius. Page 56.

[Pg 57]
Five minutes later our prisoner was snugly
stowed aft, near the cabin bulkhead, and we
had brought the pungy to anchor lest she over-run
the port we counted on making.



[Pg 58]
CHAPTER IV.

A LIVELY TUSSLE.


Darius would have it that the traitor had not
been seriously hurt by the blow on the head; but
when he failed to show any signs of consciousness
after we stowed him away in the hold, I grew
alarmed, and, calling on Jim Freeman for assistance,
set about trying to bring him to life, for
of a verity I believed him dead.

It was not until we had worked over him ten
minutes or more that I could see any change, and
then suddenly he opened his eyes, blinking in
the rays of the lantern Jim was holding close by
his face.

"What happened to me?" he asked wildly, and
as my fears that he had been killed were banished
by the words, so did my anger against him return.

"You were known to have been giving information
to the enemy, and piloting English spies to
a hiding-place," I replied sharply. "We took
it upon ourselves to cut your career as a traitor
short, and while the job was being done you got[Pg 59]
a clip on the head that knocked you senseless."

While I was speaking the cur looked me full
in the face, as if trying to make out who I was;
but I believe he feigned ignorance only that he
might have time in which to decide upon a course
of action.

I could see by the look in his eyes, when his
mind was made up as to how he should steer, and
a moment later he said with a start of pretended
surprise.

"Is it you, Amos Grout? I was afraid I had
fallen into the hands of enemies!"

"You are not among friends, and that is certain,"
I replied, boiling with rage because the
miserable cur would try to pull wool over my
eyes, for I well knew what tack he was about to
take.

"And are you willin' to hold enmity simply because
we had a bit of a scrimmage over differences
of opinion? I thought all that was settled
on the spot."

"So it was," I said curtly.

"Then why have you tied me up in this fashion?"

"Listen to me, Elias Macomber," I cried. "Do
you think for a moment that you can deceive any
one aboard this craft. We heard all you said to
the British officer who is in the Patuxent with a
boat's crew spying, and know where you took
him to pass the night. We sailed up the river[Pg 60]
for the purpose of capturing you, and here you
remain until we can deliver the meanest traitor in
Maryland over to Commodore Barney."

Now the cur was frightened, and with good
cause. He would have said something more,
thinking, I dare say, that it might yet be possible
to blind me; but I refused to listen.

"I only came here to learn if you were alive,
and now that matter has been settled, I count on
leaving you. Don't be so foolish as to think you
can wiggle out of the scrape by lying, for when
you made your talk with the Britisher this pungy
was on the other side of the river, her spars
hidden by the trees. We heard nearly every word
that was spoken."

"An' you're gettin' out of this part of the
trouble mighty easy, if Amos insists you shall be
left alone," Jim added angrily. "If I had my
way, all hands of us would take a turn at
thumpin' you, an' then the account between us
wouldn't be square."

"Come on, Jim," I said impatiently. "It is
doing no good to parley with such as him. Leave
the traitor to himself until the commodore directs
what shall be done."

Elias called after us imploringly as we went
out of the hold; but I had no desire to remain
longer with the cur, and we put on the hatch in
order that, if he did succeed in freeing himself
of the bonds, he would yet be imprisoned.[Pg 61]

On gaining the deck I looked around for
Darius, but he was not to be seen, and Jerry,
understanding for whom I searched, said:

"The old man has gone ashore. He counts on
lookin' around the mill, so that we may know
exactly how to get at work when the time comes."

"At work?" I repeated in bewilderment.
"What does he reckon on doing now that we have
caught the traitor?"

"It is in his mind that we can make prisoners
of all the boat's crew, an' if that could be done,
we'd be takin' with us such as would insure a
hearty welcome from the commodore."

"We had better let well enough alone," I replied
irritably. "If Commodore Barney won't
be pleased to see him when we offer our own services,
the use of the pungy, and the biggest
traitor in Maryland, then there's little reason to
try to purchase his favor."

"You've agreed that Darius should run this
thing to suit himself, an' he's doin' it. I believe
he's right, too! If there's a chance to take a few
prisoners, it would be downright folly to let it
slip."

"And do you expect that we can capture at
least half a dozen well-armed Britishers?"

"There are as many of us, when you come to
figgerin' up the fightin' force, an' the advantage
of takin' them by surprise will overbalance the
difference in weapons."[Pg 62]

It was useless to argue with Jerry, as I understood
by his tone, therefore I turned away, saying
to myself that by trying to bite off too big a
piece in the way of taking prisoners, we might
find the tables turned very suddenly to our disadvantage.

Jim Freeman and his friends seemed to be of
the same mind as Jerry, and I said nothing to
them lest I be accused of faint-heartedness, when
everything was apparently going our way.

We waited in silence for the coming of Darius,
allowing the Avenger to remain in the stream
where some of the boys had anchored her while
I was caring for the prisoner, and not until nearly
midnight did the old man put in an appearance.

Jim Freeman was on the lookout well forward,
and that he did his duty well was shown by the
fact that he came aft with the word that a canoe
was drifting down the river while the craft was
yet some distance away.

Jerry and I, each with a musket, went forward
to make certain the newcomer was a friend
rather than an enemy, and when we hailed softly,
Darius replied with a low hissing sound which
was familiar to us all.

He made fast, came inboard, and entered the
cuddy without speaking, therefore we followed,
knowing full well that he had something of importance
to impart.[Pg 63]

When we were all together, unable to see each
other because of the darkness, Darius said softly,
in a tone of triumph:

"I've found the Britishers, an' can put my
hand on the whole gang without much trouble.
There are but three men an' the officer, who, I
reckon, will be the only fellow to make much fuss
when we get at work. Now I'm countin' that one
of Jim's friends shall be left on board to look
out for the pungy, an' make certain the traitor
don't kick up any row. Three of us will have a
musket each, an' the other two can do mighty
good work with belayin' pins."

"Where are the men?" Jerry asked.

"In the loft of the mill. The officer is havin'
a right sociable time with Essek Harland, an' if
the miller's bottle holds out, I reckon them two
won't be in shape to make much trouble. Jim is
to say which of his party shall stay aboard, an'
the sooner the rest of us get to work the better,
for I want to begin the scrimmage in a couple of
hours."

It was evident that my opinion as to whether
the attempt to capture the Britishers should be
made, was not to be asked, and yet I must follow
where Darius led, or give my comrades good
reason for calling me a coward       or worse.

The old man settled it that he and Jerry should
arm themselves with belaying pins, and the two
muskets he brought back from Benedict, together[Pg 64]
with our old fowling-piece, was distributed
among the rest of us.

Jim Freeman named Dody Wardwell as the
one to keep ship and look after the prisoner, and
Darius instructed the watchman to be free with
his blows in case Elias tried to pick up a row.

"If he undertakes to yip even once, give him
a dose over the head that will put him to sleep,
an' it won't be much harm if you kill such a cur
as he is. Keep your wits about you, lad, an' remember
that the prisoner is the one who can
make the most trouble."

Then the old man saw to it that each of our
weapons was loaded, after which he led the way
to the rail where the canoe was made fast.

The little craft would not carry more than
three, therefore two trips were necessary in order
to land us all, and when we stood on the bank
Darius proposed that Jerry paddle the boat up
to the mill.

"Why do we want her there?" I asked, thinking
he was providing for a means of escape. "We
couldn't all take passage in her, and in case we
need to get away in a hurry, it might be done
easier by striking into the woods."

"I'm not thinkin' how we can get her off, for if
the plan fails to work there's little chance any
of us will need the canoe," Darius said grimly,
and I began to understand that he might be more
of a fighter than would suit me. "It may be we[Pg 65]
shall want to send some prisoners down to keep
Macomber company, an' then a small craft will
come in handy, for their boat is hauled up high
an' dry among the bushes; she is so heavy that it
would be a long job to float her."

Jerry was so impatient to be in the thick of
danger that he hardly waited for the old man to
conclude his long-winded speech, and before the
last word had hardly been spoken he was paddling
up stream at a rate which told that he
would arrive at the rendezvous some time in advance
of us who were to walk.

Neither was Darius willing to waste much
time, and when Jerry was lost to view in the darkness
he struck through the underbrush toward
the highway, leading the party, while I brought
up the rear.

It can well be fancied that we moved with the
utmost caution, for people do not set out on such
an enterprise as we were bent upon with any
great blowing of horns, and although none of us
were what might be called woodsmen, I flatter
myself that we did not bungle the job very badly.

Hardly more than a quarter-hour had passed
when Darius left the underbrush to cut across
toward the river, and within five minutes more
we were halted near the southeast corner of the
mill, not having heard or seen anything of those
whom we hoped to make prisoners.

Jerry joined us almost immediately, having[Pg 66]
been on the lookout during five minutes or more,
and he reported that there had been no signs of
life in the vicinity since his arrival.

"We who carry the clubs will go ahead, an', if
it so be possible, do the biggest part of the work,
for our weapons ain't the kind that make much
of any noise," Darius whispered. "Jim Freeman
will stand guard at the door of the mill, but he
is not to shoot unless it becomes necessary to
prevent the Britisher or the miller from takin'
a hand in the scrimmage, pervidin' there is one.
Now follow me, lads, an' remember that we must
get the three sailors under our thumbs, once we've
started, no matter what turns up."

We stole up to the big door on the northwest
corner, the only entrance to the building, and,
as I had expected, found it fastened on the inside.
One would hardly have supposed that the
Britishers in hiding would neglect to make themselves
as secure as possible.

It appeared that Darius was not disappointed,
for after pushing gently at the door, and motioning
for Jim to stand in front of it, he led the way
along the northerly side of the mill to a portion
of the under-pinning which had given way, disclosing
an aperture through which a mule might
have been driven.

"Keep close at my heels," he whispered, and
then he plunged into the darkness, we obeying his
command to the letter, for a mis-step might throw[Pg 67]
us into the mill-race, which we could hear rippling
close at hand.

One would have said that the old man had
always lived in this place, so directly and swiftly
did he go to the desired point, which was a portion
of the flooring where was a trap-door, evidently
used to dump the refuse, for suddenly we
found ourselves climbing up a heap of what appeared
to be husks and cobs of corn.

It was a simple task to gain entrance to the
building in this manner, for Darius had only to
force the trap-door up with his shoulder, and in
a twinkling we were standing on the lower floor,
near-by what I took to be the hopper.

Touching each of us in turn that we might be
warned to follow closely, Darius led the way to
the easterly end of the building, where he halted
at the foot of a flight of stairs.

Now he marshaled his force according to the
weapons. Jerry was behind him; I came next,
determined to use my musket as a club so long
as it could be done, rather than take the risk of
killing a man, and in the rear of me was Josiah
Coburn, one of Jim Freeman's party.

Now it must be understood that we could see
nothing; the darkness was so intense that one
could almost feel it, and yet we proposed to
blunder in upon enemies who would probably
shoot without warning in the direction of the
slightest suspicious noise.[Pg 68]

It was not a cheerful adventure, and I hold
myself well excused for being frightened, so that
I followed the leader's orders implicitly to the
best of my ability.

Just at this point, when we were trembling
with suppressed excitement, and, as in my case,
fear, Darius remembered that he had not unlocked
the outer door in order that Jim might
hide within the building, and we were forced to
stand at the foot of the stairs while he groped his
way back to remedy the neglect.

It seemed to me that we remained there hardly
daring to breathe, a full half-hour, although I
suppose now that it was no more than five minutes,
and then our leader was returned.

Pushing his way to the head of the line once
more, we began the ascent of the stairs, each
fellow stepping cautiously; but despite all our
efforts each board sent forth loud protesting
creaks as we bore our weight upon it, and the only
wonder was that the Britishers did not awaken
sooner.

The noise we made in ascending the stairs
seemed to me loud enough to alarm the inmates
of the house near at hand, and, therefore, I was
neither startled nor surprised when some person
at one end of the second floor, cried out:

"Who is there? What's the row?"

"Can't you give your shipmates the same show
for a watch below that you've got?" Darius[Pg 69]
asked with a regular deep-sea note in his voice,
and this it was that gave us a slight advantage,
since the men did not open fire.

"How did you get here?" the same voice
asked, and again the old man answered as if
speaking to shipmates:

"The bloomin' swab that piloted you here, gave
us the course. Where are you?"

"Over here," and the voice came from the
westerly end of the building, thus showing that
we must walk the entire length of the mill before
coming upon our adversaries. "What ship are
you from?"

My heart stood still as this question was asked,
for I knew only too well that Darius was wholly
ignorant as to what British vessels had entered
the bay; but the old sailor never hesitated, as he
replied:

"What other than the flag-ship, you lubber?"

"No, I'll be burned if you are!" the man cried
loudly, and I heard him spring to his feet.
"She's in the Potomac river long before this!
Rouse up, my bullies, an' let's have a look at
these beach-combers."

During this brief conversation we had been
advancing swiftly in the direction from which
the sailor's voice could be heard, and when his
comrades were ready to receive us, we could not
have been a dozen paces distant from the three.

I felt, rather than saw, that Darius sprang for[Pg 70]ward;
there was a dull thud, a groan, and a cry
from one of the other Britishers which told that
the battle was on, but the number of active
enemies had been reduced by one, for there could
be no question but that Darius had put his man
out of the fight for some time to come.

I ran forward with my companions; but it was
impossible to use the musket, even had I been
eager to shoot, because of the darkness, and as
I swung the weapon from side to side, striving to
feel my way, some one clutched me by the throat.

"Here's one of 'em!" I managed to scream
before the fellow's fingers shut off my wind, and
then I had my hands full trying to save my own
life.

I managed to hit my adversary two or three
solid blows which weakened his hold somewhat,
otherwise I would have been strangled in short
order, and then I fought as I never did before,
but sadly at a disadvantage, as can be imagined.

How long we swayed to and fro, I striving to
reach the enemy's face with my fists, and he trying
to strengthen his hold on my throat, I know
not; but certain it is that I held him in fairly
good play five minutes or more before the report
of Jim Freeman's musket told that the Britishers
were about to receive reinforcements.

Even as I fought with my adversary I understood
that the English officer, and, probably, the
miller, aroused by the noise of the scrimmage,[Pg 71]
were coming to the rescue, and the thought
flashed through my mind that in a few moments
more the battle would be decided in favor of his
majesty's forces.

Just at that moment a heavy body pushed past
me; I heard that sickening sound which tells that
a living object has been struck a powerful blow,
and instantly the hands relaxed their grasp on
my throat.

"That makes the third one; we've got the upper
hands of all up here, an' you lads are to make
the Britishers fast the best you can in the darkness,
while I 'tend to the visitors."

It was Darius who spoke, and when this had
been said I understood that he was running toward
the stairway.

Now it was possible to see faint gleams of
light coming through the cracks of the floor, and
I realized that the newcomers had with them a
lantern.

The report of Jim's musket had been followed
by the discharge of a pistol, and I heard the lad
running across the floor at full speed.

I did not have sense enough to obey the old
man's command in regard to the prisoners; but
stood there like a simple, staring at the moving
rays of light, and wondering how long it would
take the British officer to shoot us all down.

Then, to my great surprise, I heard a voice[Pg 72]
from the head of the stairs, on the floor where we
were, cry loudly:

"This way, sir! We've got the best of two
bloomin' Yankees, an' the other is sneakin' in
some corner!"

There came the sound of hurried footsteps, and
then the light of the lantern so far illumined the
head of the stairway that I could see Darius, lying
at full length on the floor, within a few inches
of the opening.

Just for one second I stood as if stupefied, and
then I understood what the old man would
do.

The British officer ascended swiftly; but before
his head was fairly above the top of the stairs
Darius stretched out his long arm, seizing the
gentleman by the throat even as my adversary
had seized me.

Now I had my wits about me; running forward
swiftly I caught the lantern before the officer
could let go his grasp on it, and thus made it
possible to have a view of what was going on.

Darius hauled his captive up, much as if he
had been a bale of merchandise, and as he was
dragged to the floor I saw one whom I believed to
be the miller, directly behind him, within three
steps of the top of the stairs.

With the lantern in my left hand, I thrust forward
the barrel of my musket full in his face, as
I said sharply:

"Throw down that gun, or I'll fire!"



With the lantern in my left hand, I thrust forward the barrel of
my musket full in the face of the miller. Page 72.


[Pg 73]
The man was armed in much the same fashion
as was I; but he had little stomach for fighting,
as could be seen when he dropped the weapon
immediately I spoke, and when it fell clattering
to the floor below, Jim Freeman came into view
from behind a pile of bags.

"Can you look after the miller, Jim?" I cried,
and the lad replied as he came bounding up the
stairs:

"Ay, let him go, an' I'll blow the whole top
of his head off if he dares to look crosswise!"

I knew Jim's musket must be empty, since he
had not had time to recharge it after firing that
which served as an alarm; but I took the chances
of the fact being discovered, and turned with
the lantern held high above my head to view the
scene.

Near at hand Darius was kneeling on the
British officer's chest, industriously engaged in
strapping the latter's arms to his body with the
prisoner's waist-belt.

In the distance Jerry and Josiah knelt beside
a form which was stretched out frightfully limp,
as if life had departed; but I observed that they
were securing the man's hands and feet with portions
of his trousers.

Beyond them a short distance was a second
Britisher, tied tightly with what appeared to be
strips torn from his own clothing, and midway[Pg 74]
between them and Darius, was a third body, evidently
that of the man who had attacked me; but
he remained motionless, and, having heard the
blow which struck him down, I could well understand
why he did not give any very violent signs
of life.

It did not appear that I was needed elsewhere,
therefore I turned my attention to the miller,
who was standing like a statue, not daring to
lift a finger lest Jim should "blow off the top of
his head."

"Come here," I said to him. "Come here while
my friend trusses you up in proper fashion.
What can you find there to tie him with, Jim?"

"Plenty," Jim cried gleefully as he picked
up from the floor a couple of bags and began cutting
them into strips. "Here's enough an' to
spare, of what is better than rope."

The venture had come to a most successful
end, providing there were no others in the vicinity
whose love for the British would prompt
them to interfere, and I was amazed, even amid
the excitement of victory, that we had come off
ahead when it seemed certain the enemy could
overcome us easily.

Darius, having bound his captive, stood up
facing me, and from the expression on his face
one never would have supposed that he had just
come unscratched out of as lively a tussle as I
ever took part in. It was as if he had been stow[Pg 75]ing
oysters in the hold of the Avenger, and was
stretching his back before going at it again.

"You've done a big thing," I said, holding out
my hand to congratulate him. "To you belongs
all the credit of having taken these prisoners,
and when we meet Commodore Barney I shall
insist that he hears the whole story, for I doubt
if every old sailor has head enough to put such
a venture through in good shape."

It could readily be seen that the old man was
pleased by the praise; but he made as if it was
of no consequence.

"You lads have done your full share, an' if
any credit is to be given it goes to the whole
crowd."

"Not a bit of it!" Jerry cried, looking up
from his task of binding the sailor with whom I
had fought. "It's as Amos says; but for you
this never would have been done, an' it won't
be my fault if all the men of the fleet don't hear
of it."

"We're not out of the woods yet," Darius
said, as though he would change the subject.
"If I'd had half the head you give me credit for,
we'd run the pungy up here, instead of leavin'
her a mile away."

"Josiah can go after her," I suggested, "and
by the time we're ready to put our prisoners
aboard she should be here."

This proposition suited the old man, and Jim's[Pg 76]
friend left the building at full speed, while I
asked Darius to make certain the miller was
trussed up in proper fashion.

"What'er you goin' to do with me?" Essek
Harland cried with a whine. "I ain't to be
blamed for what's been done this night! How
can I help it if a crowd of Britishers take possession
of my mill?"

"Talk that over with Elias Macomber; he's
aboard the pungy," Darius replied in a matter-of-fact
tone as he proceeded to bind the man with
strips of bags provided by Jim.



[Pg 77]
CHAPTER V.

WITH THE FLEET.


The British sailors did not make any talk on
returning to consciousness and finding themselves
bound hand and foot. The officer, however,
after recovering from the bewilderment
which appeared to have come over him because
of having been taken prisoner in such an unceremonious
fashion, protested against being tied
like a criminal.

"Will you give your word to make no attempt
at escape?" Darius asked; but this did not suit
the Britisher, for most likely he was reckoning on
a rescue by those of the people who favored the
king, and there were not a few of such vermin on
the Patuxent river.

"I refuse to give my parole, save to an officer
of the American army or navy," he said stiffly,
and Darius replied cheerily:

"Then you see that we've got no other course
save to deal out the same dose for all, 'cause
we're not countin' on losin' any of you."

"What are you goin' to do with me?" the[Pg 78]
miller asked, and I took it on myself to make
reply:

"You'll get the same treatment as Elias Macomber,
and however harsh it may be, you won't
have it as tough as is deserved. These others
are prisoners of war; but you two are traitors
and spies, therefore must expect to fare according
to your deserts."

"That's about the size of it, Amos," Darius
said as he went from one to another of the prisoners
to make certain they were secured properly,
and in condition to travel. "I reckon, lad, that
we might as well be gettin' the crowd down to the
shore, for unless the wind has died away entirely
Josiah Coburn should be here mighty soon."

"How would it do to take along a supply of
meal?" Jerry asked. "If it so be that we
don't come up with the fleet by noon to-morrow,
we'd be short of provisions, with so many to
feed."

"Right you are, lad. We'll take from Essek
Harland's meal-chest as much as may be needed,
an' surely he can't make any complaint when he
gets his share."

While Jerry was rummaging around to discover
the miller's store, we got the prisoners down-stairs,
finding it no slight task because two of
the sailors, in a spirit of pure mischief, refused
to walk, and we were forced to tote them like
so many barrels of flour. By the time they were[Pg 79]
at the foot of the stairs, however, both were willing
to provide their own means of transportation,
for we did not handle them with any too
much care.

Essek Harland whimpered and whined like
the cur that he was, until we came to suspect he
might be making a noise in order to give an
alarm to somebody in the vicinity, when Darius
reduced him to silence by threatening to put a
gag in his mouth.

We had no more than got in fairly good marching
shape when Josiah came up with the Avenger,
the wind being strong enough to push her along
about as fast as a man could walk.

Then well on to an hour was spent before the
prisoners and the meal were stowed in the hold
of the pungy, and I counted that it was near daybreak
when we started up the river toward where
Commodore Barney's fleet was supposed to be.

It struck me that we should meet with a warm
reception from the commander, when we delivered
up to him the Britishers and the traitors,
for by capturing the spies we had delayed the
coming of the enemy for a few hours at least.

And in thinking of this I came to ask myself
how we were to present ourselves? Whether
as lads who wanted to make a bargain to supply
the fleet with fish, or as recruits? Ponder over
it as I might, it was impossible to come to any
satisfactory conclusion, and I decided that be[Pg 80]fore
committing myself in any way I would ask
the advice of my father, whom I was likely to
find on some of the vessels belonging to the
flotilla.

It was Darius who broke in upon my perplexing
thoughts by asking:

"Well, what do you think of it now, lad? We
couldn't have done the job any browner if we'd
had on board a full cargo of rifles an' ammunition."

"Ay, Darius, it has been well done because
you were on hand; but I question if another
might have worked the scheme as well."

"There are thousands who'd make less bungle
of it," the old man replied, and I could see that
he was well pleased because of being praised, even
by a boy. "All that's needed is a little backbone;
but if the other fellow happens to have more'n
you've got, then things are apt to go wrong."

"Thanks to your arrangement of the affair,
the enemy didn't have a chance to show his
pluck; but we'd have been in a bad box if you
hadn't made the Britishers believe, for a minute
or two, that we were their friends."

Darius laughed heartily as he thought of the
brief conversation with the sailors, and then
said with a chuckle:

"If I'd only known the name of a vessel belongin'
to their fleet, we'd been right on top of
'em before bein' found out; but as it was we got
well alongside when the trouble began."[Pg 81]

Then Jerry came aft to take part in the conversation,
and we spent a good half-hour praising
each other and chuckling over the good fortune
that had been ours.

We might have continued at such pleasing
occupation a very long while, but that day began
to break, and there was too much work on hand
to admit of further foolishness.

Darius gave up the tiller to me, and went below
to look after the prisoners, returning five
minutes later with the British officer, who, much
to my surprise, was no longer fettered.

"This gentleman has decided that he can give
his parole to us as well as to brother officers,"
Darius said by way of introduction. "He has
pledged his word to make no attempt at escape,
therefore we will give him the liberty of the ship."

"Which won't mean much for one who has
been accustomed to the luxury found on board
some of his majesty's vessels," I added, trying to
show that I had some semblance of good breeding.
"An oyster pungy isn't the most beautiful craft
in the world."

"Very true," the officer replied with a friendly
smile; "but there is a vast difference between the
hold and the deck of an oysterman."

"Yes, I can fancy that to one unaccustomed
to such things, the Avenger seems like a foul
ship below."

"So your vessel is named the Avenger?" and[Pg 82]
the gentleman looked at me quizzically. "Isn't
that rather high-sounding for a peaceful fisherman?"

The officer was so different from what I had
fancied a Britisher might be, and had such a
friendly air, that I made no hesitation in telling
him how the pungy got her name, and after the
explanation he ceased to laugh at it.

"I can well believe that some of your people
have been abused," he said in a kindly tone; "but
there are always two sides to a story, and the
commander of one of the king's ships may believe
that he is doing absolutely that which is right
and just, when in your eyes he commits a most
grievous wrong."

I had sense enough to understand that if I
attempted to argue with the officer on the causes
of the war I should speedily find myself in deep
water, therefore I made reply:

"It is not for me to measure words with such
as you, sir. I know that Jerry's brother, who
had never stepped foot on other than American
soil, was forced to serve in one of your ships, being
carried forcibly and secretly away, to the
great distress of all who cared for him."

"And in that case his majesty's officers did
a most grievous wrong," he said frankly, and
then as if to turn the subject of conversation, he
asked, "When do you expect to come up with
Barney's fleet, for I understand you are in search
of it?"[Pg 83]

"If the wind holds, we should be there by
noon, providing Commodore Barney is yet at
Nottingham."

With this the gentlemen turned away to take
note of what was being done, for Darius had
brought the three sailors on deck, they also
having solemnly pledged themselves to refrain
from attempt at escape.

Jerry was making preparations for cooking
breakfast, which would be no small job with so
many to be fed, and Jim Freeman was helping
him. It was to be a good wholesome meal, better
than we of the Avenger had enjoyed for many a
day; because there was to be a plentiful supply
of fried ham with corn-dodgers, which last Jerry
could make better than any person I ever knew,
except my mother.

The British sailors were taking things comfortably,
being seated on the deck well forward,
and apparently enjoying the sail up the river,
even though they were going as prisoners rather
than passengers who could come or depart at
will.

Darius remained in the hold some time, and
when he showed himself again as if his work was
done, I asked what he had been about.

"I've been makin' them two sneaks fast to
a stanchion, where they won't have any too good
a time. I reckon we've got to treat 'em somewhere
near decent, though it goes mightily agin[Pg 84]
the grain. How is breakfast comin' on? I
could eat the toughest mule that ever walked!"

Fortunately for him Jerry announced at this
moment that the meal was ready, and Darius
would have it that I should eat in the cuddy with
the officer; but I insisted he was the one who
could best do the honors aboard the Avenger,
when we had seamen as guests, and literally
forced him to act the host.

Dody Wardwell and Josiah Coburn were detailed
to feed the prisoners, including the curs
in the hold, and Jerry, Jim and I ate on the deck
aft, where I could at the same time keep the
pungy in the channel.

Jim brought out some of the stores he had
taken from home, and we lads had a veritable
feast, with the cause of success to give flavor to
food which could not be improved upon even
though it had been served on a king's table.

It is needless for me to set down all that was
said during the forenoon when we sailed very
slowly up the river, chatting in friendly fashion
with our prisoners       meaning such of them as
were allowed to remain on deck       , or discussing
our plans for the future among ourselves, and as
we did this last we almost unconsciously reckoned
Jim and his friends as belonging to the
pungy. In fact, after what they had done toward
helping out on the night's work, it was no more
than right they should be allowed to consider[Pg 85]
themselves as a portion of the Avenger's crew, if
so be their desire ran that way.

It was half an hour past twelve o'clock when
we came in sight of the flotilla anchored off
Nottingham, and seemingly blocking the river
until it would have been difficult for anything
larger than a canoe to pass through.

"Where shall we find the commodore among
all that crowd of vessels?" I asked in perplexity,
and Darius replied promptly:

"He's like to be aboard the Scorpion, unless
havin' gone ashore. At all events, it's there we
should look for him."

Fortunately for us, the schooner was anchored
nearer down stream than the remainder of the
craft, and there was no difficulty in running the
Avenger alongside.

"You shall do the talking, Darius," I said
as Jim Freeman passed a hawser, and his friends
dropped the sails.

"I'll look after that part of it so far as tellin'
Joshua Barney who you are; but after that you'll
take the tiller, for the owners of a vessel are
the ones to show themselves."

Just then a kindly-faced gentleman came from
the schooner's cabin and looked about as if asking
how we dared to make fast alongside. He
was one whom I would have picked out for a
good friend, rather than a desperate fighter,
therefore my surprise was great when Darius[Pg 86]
whisked off his hat, made a great flourish as he
bowed in sailorman fashion, and said:

"We're here to report for duty, an' it please
you, Commodore Barney, though you wasn't
more'n a captain when I sailed under ye. We've
brought a few British prisoners, an' a couple of
traitors."

"Why, bless my heart, its Darius Thorpe!"
the commander cried as if well pleased at seeing
the old sailor, whereupon Darius bowed again,
grinning with delight until it seemed as if he
would split his mouth from ear to ear.

"It's the same old shell-back, sir, only he's
turned oysterman, bein' too stiff in the joints
for much deep-sea work."

"When your joints grow stiff, Darius, I shall
begin to look after mine; but up to the present
time they're fit for a hornpipe almost any day.
Is that your craft?"

"No, sir; she is owned by these two lads," and
he pointed to Jerry and me.

"And you have taken prisoners on your own
account?" the commodore asked, looking directly
at me as he advanced nearer the rail, therefore
I felt called upon to reply.

"It was really Darius who took the prisoners,
sir," I made answer. "He planned the work,
and did most of the execution; the rest of us
simply obeyed his orders, with the result that we
have this officer," and I pointed to the gentleman[Pg 87]
who was standing well forward as if to be out
of ear-shot, "with three sailors, all on parole.
In addition, there are, in the hold, two men living
on the river, whom we found giving information
to the enemy, and aiding them in their spying."

"Come aboard, and let me hear the particulars,"
the commodore said kindly, and yet the
words were a command.

I beckoned to Jerry, and, observing it, the commander
said:

"Come with the lads, Darius Thorpe, it may
be that I have particular need of you."

We three clambered on to the schooner's deck,
following the commodore into the cabin which
was not fitted up very much better than our
cuddy, save that it had a fair-sized table with
chairs, and here we seated ourselves as comfortably
as if about to have speech with our equals.

"Now tell me how it happens that you are
on the Patuxent river taking prisoners here and
there without due warrant from the government
at Washington," the commodore said with a
smile, and I began by explaining why we started
in search of the fleet, not forgetting to make
mention of the fact that we had hoped to find a
sale for fish or oysters.

Then I gave a detailed account of all that had
happened to us, winding up by saying:

"We count that you'll take the prisoners from[Pg 88]
us, sir, because we haven't overly much food for
so large a number, and if it so be you can buy
such as we can catch, it shall be at whatever
price you set."

"Do you think, lad, that I would encourage
you to spend your time fishing when you have
already shown yourselves capable of bigger
things? I can use Darius to good advantage, and
I doubt not but that he may need you and your
vessel. Are you minded to serve your country,
lad?"

"Ay, sir, if it so be she needs me; but lads
like Jerry and me may be of more service as
fishermen than as soldiers."

"Regarding that I am not so certain, because
of the proof you have brought; it strikes me that
your pungy and her crew will well serve my
turn. You may deliver the prisoners to an officer
whom I will send aboard, and later in the day
we will have another chat."

Then the commodore arose to his feet in token
that the interview was at an end, and we lads
went out, Joshua Barney saying to Darius as
he went up the companion-way stairs:

"Since your joints are so stiff it may be a
good plan for you to stay aboard the sloop during
the remainder of the day, and then you'll
be on hand when I'm ready to see you."

I was both surprised and pleased to know that
the old man stood so well with the commander,[Pg 89]
I had looked upon Darius Thorpe as a broken-down
sailor; but Commodore Barney appeared
to have a far different idea on the subject.

Darius was actually puffed up with pride
when he gained the deck of the Avenger. His
face was as red as a beet, and his mouth open so
wide that I could have tossed a quart of oysters
into it without spilling one.

"Well, lads," he cried, turning on Jerry and
me insistently, "you've seen the biggest man in
this country, an' what do you think of him?"

Neither Jerry nor I could do less than praise
the commodore, for he had treated us in a
friendly fashion; but although we spoke our
minds emphatically, declaring that he was a
very pleasant gentleman, Darius was not satisfied.

"I tell you he's the greatest man in the country,"
he repeated, and I am not certain but that
he would have insisted on our saying the same
over and over again if an officer from the
schooner had not come to receive the prisoners.

The officer and the sailors went over the rail
on being told that they were to change quarters;
but it was necessary that the traitors be brought
from the hold, and I proposed that Darius and
Jim Freeman attend to such duty, for I had no
desire to set eyes on Elias Macomber again.

"Let's you and I deliver some of these packages
and messages with which we are charged," I[Pg 90]
suggested to Jerry. "By so doing we shall meet
many old friends, and I would, if possible, have
speech with my father before seeing the commodore
again."

"Why?" Jerry asked as if in surprise, when
we went into the cuddy to get the articles which
were to be delivered.

I was at a loss to make reply. It would not be
pleasant to tell the lad that I wanted my father's
advice before agreeing to serve under the commodore,
since he might believe that to be a coward's
trick, therefore I said after some hesitation:

"It is for him to say what I shall do; surely
a fellow's father should decide anything of this
kind."

"But your mother the same as told you to
come."

"Ay, and I am here; now I will see my father,
which is but natural. Do not spend so much
time in idle words for I would be out of the pungy
before those curs are brought from the hold."

We had our arms full of packages by this time,
and it did not take us long to load them into
the canoe, after which we paddled among the
fleet having a bundle or message for some person
aboard nearly every craft in the river.

It was not until our work was nearly done
that I came upon my father and he received me
as if expecting I would come.

"When did you arrive at Benedict?" he asked.[Pg 91]

"Yesterday noon, sir."

"You couldn't well have got here earlier because
of the wind. I allowed you would join
us as soon as possible."

"Then you think, father, that I should serve
under the commodore, taking the chances of losing
the pungy after having paid so much money
for her?"

"Don't you?" he asked sharply, and I could
do no less than reply as he expected I would.

Thus it was settled beyond a peradventure
that the Avenger and her crew should become a
portion of Commodore Barney's flotilla, and I
really felt better in mind after the question had
been definitely decided.

We stopped long enough to give father a detailed
account of our adventures, and by the way
he slapped me on the back after the story was
brought to an end, I knew that he felt right well
pleased because I had begun serving my country
in such a satisfactory manner.

When we returned to the Avenger after our
round of visits, we found Jim Freeman and his
friends keeping ship in great style. They were
looking as proud as peacocks, and I failed to
understand the meaning of it all, for ordinarily
they were meek lads, until Jim whispered:

"The commodore is a mighty nice man."

"Ay, that he is," I replied, thinking that
Darius had been drilling the crew in our absence[Pg 92]
to sing the praises of Joshua Barney both in and
out of season.

"We're goin' to have a chance to do some big
things."

"Why do you think so?"

"Because when Darius gave the word that the
pungy had better be hauled down stream a bit
an' anchored, the commodore put a stop to it,
by allowin' that he wanted this craft where he
could put his hand on her."

"And because of that you think that we
are to play an important part in this portion of
the war, eh?"

"It looks like it for a fact," Jim replied, strutting
to and fro, and I could not but laugh outright,
for the idea that we might be called upon
to do more than any others seemed ridiculous.

Matters began to wear a different look a moment
later, however, when an officer came over
from the Scorpion, and said that the commodore
would have speech with Jerry and me.

"Where is Darius?" I asked, looking around
without seeing the old man.

"He's been aboard the schooner this last half
hour an' I've taken particular notice that everybody
else is kept out of the cabin," Jim replied.
"That's one reason why I'm so certain we'll
have a soft time of it while we stay with the
fleet."

"Don't stand there chewin' things over in[Pg 93]
your mind," Jerry said impatiently as I loitered
near the helm. "It strikes me that when the
commander of a fleet sends for a couple of lads
they should step out right lively."

Jerry was right, and I meekly followed him
to the commodore's cabin, where we saw Darius
hob-nobbing with Joshua Barney as if they were
two old cronies.

We lads saluted in as sailorly a fashion as
was possible, for we were not well up on such
manners, and the commodore said abruptly as
he handed me a folded paper:

"Here is a guarantee from the government,
through me as the commander of the naval forces
in this section, that if your vessel is captured
or destroyed by the enemy while you are under
my orders, you are to be paid the sum of four
hundred dollars."

I was dumfounded. Of course it was pleasing
to know that we would be paid a good price
in case we lost the Avenger; but why such an
arrangement should be made at this time was
way beyond me, until Darius said:

"Wouldn't it be a good idee, sir, if you was
to tell the lads what is expected of 'em? I'm
not allowin' they'd go contrary to what I said;
but it would be pleasanter all around if they
got the business from your lips."

"It shall be as Darius says," and the commander
half-turned in his chair to face Jerry[Pg 94]
and me. "I propose that you shall continue
to act as oystermen; but without spending much
time at the labor. In other words, I want information
from the enemy, such as you can gather,
and have spent considerable time explaining
where and how you may communicate with me.
That part of the business need not be repeated.
This much you should know: Darius has said
that you would do, so far as possible, whatever
I might set for you. Now I want your pungy
to drop down the river at once; you are to act
as if engaged in the peaceful occupation of fishing
for oysters, and try to sell your cargo to
the enemy. In other words, lads, you are to spy
out the disposition of the British ships when they
advance, for I am convinced that as yet they
remain in the lower bay."

If I had been faint-hearted before, what shall
be said of my condition now? In plain words,
the commodore proposed that we turn spies, and
if we were caught while thus engaged, we would
make a speedy trip to the nearest British yard-arm
with a rope around our necks!

Jerry did not appear to realize the dangers of
the undertaking proposed, and when the commodore
suggested that we had better get under way
at once, he started toward the companion-way
as if about to embark on some pleasure excursion.

"Are we to take on any weapons?" I asked,[Pg 95]
remembering the crippled muskets, and how
dangerous it might be to discharge them.

"Oystermen do not carry modern arms,"
Joshua Barney said curtly. "Go exactly as if
you were performing your regular work, as indeed
you are, except that the price received for
your wares does not cut any figure."



[Pg 96]
CHAPTER VI.

FEEDING THE ENEMY.


It was evident that Commodore Barney did
not propose to spend any more minutes with us
explaining the proposition he had made, and,
indeed, it really was high time he attended to
others, for no less than four gentlemen of importance
in Nottingham had sent a request for
an interview.

When the commander arose to his feet, after
settling the question as to whether we should be
prepared to defend ourselves in case the occasion
required, I started up the companion-way
stairs, beckoning for Jerry to follow.

Darius Thorpe, although he had been only a
sailor, understood somewhat of manners among
people of gentility, and he saluted properly       which
we had forgotten to do       while awaiting
an opportunity to ascend the stairs.

It was as if we no longer had an existence, so
far as Commodore Barney was concerned. We
were not yet out of the cabin when he called an[Pg 97]
orderly to say that he would see such or such
a man immediately, and began turning over
papers on his table without even glancing in our
direction.

Once on board the Avenger I stopped to face
my comrades, thinking that now has come the
time we should discuss the matter which was of
such vital importance to ourselves; but Darius
said impatiently:

"Why do you stop here, lad? Give the word
for gettin' under way, so the commodore may
see we know how to obey in sailorman fashion,
an' if there's any talkin' to be done we'll have
plenty of time for tongue waggin' while runnin'
down the river."

"But surely you're not proposing that we
shall start without knowing where we are going,
or what is to be done?" I cried, showing
quite as much impatience as he had.

"That's jest what I do propose! We can
whittle out a plan while the pungy is slippin'
down stream, as well as if she was made fast
here."

"But what about Jim Freeman and his
party?"

"There's no reason why they shouldn't go
with us; six isn't any too many for the crew of
an oysterman."

"But do you count on taking them without
first explaining the situation? It strikes me[Pg 98]
that when a fellow sets about that which may
put his neck in a halter, he is entitled to something
by way of an understanding."

"If that's all which blocks our makin' sail,
I'll soon put an end to it," and Darius beckoned
to Jim and his friends, who were standing well
forward that they might not seem to be listening
to that which possibly was not intended for
their ears.

The lads came aft quickly, knowing full well
by the expression on our faces that something
serious was afoot, and the old man said bluntly:

"The commodore wants us to spy on the
British fleets. If we're caught on their anchorage,
or nosin' around the ships, pretendin' to
be what we're not, its a case of hangin', an' salt
won't save us. If you lads want to stay aboard,
takin' the same chances we do, well an' good; if
not, you'd better go ashore in quick order, for we
shall be under way mighty soon."

"Shall we be helpin' the government the same
as if we stayed aboard one of the vessels to do
our share of fightin'?" Jim asked, and Darius
replied:

"Yes, an' a good deal more. If you were taken
prisoner after bein' in a fight, it's only a case of
goin' to jail on one of his majesty's ships; but if
you're taken while on such work as has been
given out to us, it's a hangin' for sure, with you
at the loose end of the rope."[Pg 99]

No one could say that Darius had not put the
matter plainly, and I expected to see Jim draw
back; but to my surprise he said stoutly:

"I reckon we fellows can stand it if you do;
we'll stay, an' the commodore shan't have a
chance to say that we didn't hold up our end
of the business."

Surely I could make no protest of any kind
after Jim had announced himself so firmly, and,
in order to make it appear that I was really
eager to set forth on this dangerous expedition,
I said quickly:

"Cast off there! Darius, take the tiller! Tail
on the halliards, lads!"

We got under way in fine style, and as the
pungy swung around with the current, I saw
my father waving his hat from the craft to which
he belonged, and thus knew he understood we
were bound on some service for the commander.

Nor was he the only one who bade us a mute
adieu. Half the members of the fleet made some
quiet demonstration in token of good wishes,
and just then it seemed almost a fine thing to
be thus voluntarily going into extraordinary
danger for the benefit of one's friends and acquaintances.

I am well aware that by writing down all my
thoughts I have pictured myself as a weak-kneed
lad, and one who delighted in making a show of
authority, as has been seen when I was dis[Pg 100]gruntled
because Jerry or Darius took it upon
themselves to say that this thing or that should
be done, without first consulting me, and yet
I hold it is only fair I give the same plain dealing
concerning myself as I try to in the case of
my companions.

Now, however, as we were setting out on a
cruise from which not one of us might return, I
was more than glad to surrender up to Darius
the charge of the Avenger, and I was determined
that he should keep it, taking whatsoever of
honor might come to the commander, contenting
myself with being simply a member of the
crew who would ever strive to obey all orders
promptly, whatever might be the situation. And
in so doing I counted myself to be wise.

The old man remained at the helm speaking
not a word, and chewing vigorously as we worked
the pungy down the reaches in face of a head
wind, not very strong at that, but the current
favored, therefore we had the satisfaction of
knowing that with all our pulling and hauling
we were doing better than two and a half miles
an hour.

I had expected Darius would propose that we
hold a consultation as to our future course; but
he gave no sign of so doing and Jerry finally
asked:

"Where are we headin' for?"

"Fishin'."[Pg 101]

I turned away, thinking the old man had given
an idle answer to evade questions; but Jerry
was not to be turned down so readily, and he
said with a laugh:

"We've given over the fishin' business for quite
a spell, I reckon. 'Cordin' to my way of thinkin',
an' seein's how this cruise may turn out to be
anything rather than a picnic, I allow that all
hands should know what is to be done."

"That's my idee to a dot, lad, an' I'm tryin'
to think up some kind of a plan so that when you
fellows begin to figger, I can put in my oar with
some show of sense."

"But where do you reckon that we're bound
for?"

"Fishin', lad. Where else can we be bound?"

I turned again, understanding now that the
old man was serious, and asked him if he supposed
we could do any spying on the British
fleet while we were wasting time getting oysters
or fish.

"Didn't the commodore allow that we should
keep right on bein' oystermen?" Darius asked
with just a shade of impatience. "How do you
expect we can sneak around the British fleet unless
we've got some excuse for goin' there? It
was in Joshua Barney's mind, the way I looked
at it, that we might sell oysters to the fleet, which
would account for our bein' among the vessels,
an' to do that we've got to put in a cargo."[Pg 102]

It was plain enough, now that the old man
had spoken of it, and I understood that we had
a bit of dredging before us in order to make
ready for the more important portion of the work.

"But after we get a load, Darius? Shall we
sail boldly down the bay, asking the Britishers
to buy?"

"That's what I've been tryin' to make out.
All of you can figger it 'cordin' to your own idees,
an' then we'll talk it over."

Surely this was putting it fairly, and we tried
to follow the old man's advice, or, at least I did;
but without arriving at any satisfactory conclusion.
The only plan I could put together was
that we first get our wares and then blunder
ahead trying to sell them, trusting to luck for
the rest.

We were a silent crew for some time, as each
fellow tried to think up some brilliant scheme,
and then, when midnight was nearly come, we
had arrived off Benedict.

"Why not go ashore for an hour?" Jerry
suggested, and all of us gladly agreed, I in particular,
because I wished to see my mother once
more now there was no petulance in my heart
on account of her willingness to have me go into
danger.

Darius had no relatives, or even very near
friends, in the village, therefore he volunteered
to keep ship, and Jim Freeman set us ashore in[Pg 103]
the canoe, taking two at a trip, after which each
fellow went his way.

My mother was overjoyed at seeing me so soon
again, even though I aroused her from sleep to
open the door, and asked so many questions that
I could do no less than tell her all which had
happened since I last saw her.

She was frightened at learning what we were
about to do, and showed it plainly; but never
a word did she speak against the project.

"If it is your duty, Amos, I have nothing to
say, although I wish most heartily that others
had been pushed forward into danger, and in
thus speaking I am selfish, for then some other
mother's heart would ache. Be as prudent as
you can without being cowardly, my boy, and
may God be ever with you. It is believed in
the village that Elias Macomber has gone to
join the British, because he has not been seen
since last night; but if he should escape, Amos!"

"There is little fear of that, mother," I replied
confidently. "Commodore Barney is not
the man Darius has pictured him, if he allows
such a villain to escape."

After this we talked of family matters until
I went up stairs to look at my sisters and brother
who were asleep. Then the visit was come to
an end, and I went out into the night with a
heavy heart; but determined that my family
should have no cause to blush for me.[Pg 104]

I was the first to arrive at the shore, and,
lying at full length in the canoe, I waited until
my comrades returned from their visit.

Jerry and Jim came in company, and appeared
to be excited over something, therefore to draw
them on without asking any questions, I repeated
what my mother had said concerning Elias Macomber.

"Ay, that was the talk in town this forenoon,"
Jerry replied; "but now people are saying that
he came back just before sunset       "

"Back here to Benedict?" I cried in amazement.

"Ay, Jim's mother saw him as he went by her
house on the way to his own. She saluted him,
but he made no reply       "

"But to be here he must have escaped!" I
interrupted, unable to hold my peace. "The
commodore would not have set him at liberty
without telling us!"

"That goes without sayin', an' now what shall
we do?" Jerry asked as if he had some plan in
mind.

"What can we do, except to get away before
he brings some of his cronies down here to make
a row?"

"Jerry wants to catch him over again," Jim
replied, since my partner did not speak. "If
he's alone in his house it wouldn't be such a
dreadful hard job, surely not as compared with
what we did at the mill."[Pg 105]

It seemed as if our own safety demanded that
we give some especial attention to the traitor,
and I proposed that we consult with Darius at
once.

This was agreeable to my companions, and
we boarded the Avenger without delay, rousing
the old man to bitter wrath when we told that
Elias had escaped.

"Somebody will smart for bein' so careless!"
he cried. "Joshua Barney ain't the man to overlook
anythin' of that kind. Do you allow there
may be traitors in the fleet? It looks mightily
like it when a coward like Macomber can give
'em the slip inside of twelve hours, for if he was
seen in this town at sunset, he must have been
at liberty by noon, ay, even before we got under
way!"

"Jerry thinks we might catch him again, by
going at once to his home," I said, impatient
to make the attempt or set sail, for I was not
easy in mind at lying there while the villain was
free.

"And Jerry is right!" Darius, exclaimed,
darting into the cuddy and returning in a twinkling
with the old muskets. "See that these are
well loaded, lads, an' if we can lay hands on
that cur again, I'll attend to it that he don't
walk off like a gentleman at large within any
very short time."

Well, we found the weapons in fit condition[Pg 106]
for immediate use, and paddled ashore in a hurry,
finding Josiah and Dody waiting for us. They
also had heard that Elias was in the village,
and we knew beyond a peradventure, even if we
had not been certain before, that the cur had
slipped away from those who should have
guarded him with their lives.

It was not a long walk to Macomber's house,
and on arriving there we found the building
closely shuttered as if deserted; but we were not
for taking outside indications as facts.

Although knowing full well that we were not
proceeding in accordance with the law, since
we had no authority for forcing an entrance into
a dwelling, we burst open the rear door, and
made thorough examination of the place.

The household goods were tossed and tumbled
about as if some one had lately been there having
little time to spare; but no living thing could
be found.

The traitor had no children, therefore flight
with his wife would be comparatively easy, and
I was convinced that he had gone down the river
intending to claim protection from the enemy.

"That's what he has done!" Darius said emphatically
when I gave words to my belief. "It
stands to reason that he went away in a boat,
an' there's just a chance we may come up with
him yet! Let's get on board, lads, an' if the
Avenger knows how to sail we'll bring it out of
her this night."[Pg 107]

Then we returned with all speed to the shore;
but I had little hope we could overtake the
traitor, because he had at least three or four
hours the start, and a canoe might be paddled
twice as fast as the pungy would sail with such
a light wind.

Darius, however, seemed certain we would
overtake him, and urged us lads to greater speed
or more severe exertions until the little vessel
was under way, gliding down the river but little
faster than the current would carry a canoe even
though no paddles were used.

So eager in the chase was Darius that he would
not allow either of us to go below, but insisted
that all hands remain on the lookout, lest we
over-run the game, and losing no little time as
he swung the Avenger in close to this bank or
that where the overhanging foliage afforded a
hiding place for a small boat.

Not until daylight did we arrive off St. Leonard's
bay, and it goes without saying that we
had seen nothing of our traitor, neither had we
come across a craft of any kind.

"He's bound now to go on until he overtakes
the British fleet," Darius said angrily when the
coming of daylight revealed the shores to us.
"We'll have the best of him once we're out of
the river!"

"You can't keep up the chase much longer if
we count on gettin' a cargo of oysters," Jerry[Pg 108]
suggested, and the old man declared that he
would never throw over a dredge until it became
certain that Macomber had really escaped us.

But after some reflection he was willing to
take back his words, knowing we could not go
very far into the lower bay without some excuse
for being there, and also realizing that we
must never pursue Elias within sight of any
vessel of the fleet, otherwise he might give such
information as would cut short our career in
this world.

With the coming of the new day the wind
came out of the west with a force that gave
promise of providing the pungy with a goodly
sized bone in her teeth, and in case Macomber
was no more than two hours in advance there
was yet some possibility of overtaking him.

We usually dredged for oysters off Hog Point,
or Parker's creek, therefore in a short time we
would be on the fishing grounds, unless we took
the risk of standing across the mouth of the Potomac
on the chance of seeing the traitor, and
I did not believe he would venture to make
that long stretch while the breeze was so strong.

By the time we arrived at the mouth of the
river there was no necessity of discussing the
situation, for the chase had surely come to an
end.

However great his need of coming up with the
British, Elias Macomber knew too much to trust[Pg 109]
himself in a canoe on the open bay while the
wind held as it did, and we knew beyond a peradventure
that if he had not already gained the
fleet, he was hiding on shore somewhere.

It would be folly to spend time in such a
needle-in-the-haystack business as looking for
him on shore when we had no clue to guide us,
as even Darius was forced to admit, and, therefore,
we set about the work in hand, which was
the dredging of oysters enough to give us excuse
for seeking out the enemy.

It seemed to all of us that we were in more
danger through information which Elias might
give, than we would have been while playing the
spy with him safely cared for on one of the vessels
of Commodore Barney's flotilla, and we went
about the work as if it was possible to feel the
chafing of British halters around our necks.

We began dredging exactly as we would have
done had we been trying to get a cargo for the
Baltimore market, and never a sail did we see
during all that day, a fact which told us that
the enemy was not yet ready to open his campaign.

Not until well into the night would Darius
allow that we had a sufficient quantity of oysters
to warrant us in finding purchasers, and even
then there was no more than fifteen bushels
aboard.

"It will do for a starter," Jerry said when[Pg 110]
Jim Freeman proposed that we spend one more
day dredging.

"But the first Britisher we came across would
buy as many as we've got," Jim objected, and
Jerry replied with the air of one who has
thoroughly turned the matter over in his mind:

"So much the better. We shall then have
established ourselves in the business, and can
come back for another cargo. There will be less
suspicion of us the second time."

"I reckon you're right, lad," Darius said
decidedly. "We can't expect to gather much
of any news the first pop, an' if we get acquainted,
it will be a long step in the right direction."

As a matter of course, the old man's opinion
settled the question, and we hauled around for
a run down the bay, double reefing the mainsail
and jib, as was proper when you take into
consideration the fact that we had the same as
no cargo aboard to give the pungy stiffness.

Up to this time neither one had made any
proposition as to how we were to begin operations,
and I naturally concluded that we would
sail boldly up to the first craft we saw, asking
if we could sell them oysters, therefore I suggested,
when we were standing off on a course
that would bring us on to the Tangier Islands:

"If we keep up this rate of speed, we may
come upon the enemy while it is yet night."[Pg 111]

"Ay, lad, an' I'm thinkin' it would be a good
plan."

"But people don't go out sellin' things before
daylight," I said with a laugh.

"I'm countin' on bein' properly interduced,"
Darius replied with a grin. "If we're hailed, an'
ordered to lay by till mornin', we shall have one
ship's crew that'll listen to us."

I did not understand this explanation more
than if it had been given in Latin; but the others
appeared to be satisfied, and I held my peace
rather than display ignorance.

We kept our course a couple of hours, and,
then, directly in a line with the Tangiers, I saw
the loom of what appeared to be a large ship.

"There's one of the fleet," I said in a whisper
to Darius, who was at the tiller, and he replied
in a matter-of-fact tone:

"Ay, lad, I'm allowin' she's the Severn or
the Narcissus, both of which made it hot for the
commodore in the Patuxent."

"How large are they?"

"The Severn should be carryin' thirty-eight
guns, an' the other four less, if I remember
rightly."

"I had rather we made our first attempt with
a smaller vessel," I said, feeling decidedly uncomfortable
in mind now we were so near beginning
the dangerous work.

"Bless you, lad, we might as well be over[Pg 112]hauled
by a frigate as a sloop, so far as the
chances of bein' found out are concerned; but
we're goin' through this business as slick as we
did at the mill."

Darius held the Avenger straight for the
enemy, and when we were come within half a
musket-shot I heard the hail we had been expecting:

"Sloop ahoy!"

"Ay, ay, sir!" Darius cried.

"What craft is that?"

"An oyster pungy with part of a cargo which
we're hopin' to sell, sir. Can we do any business
with you?"

"Heave to, an' lay alongside until daylight."

"Very well, sir," the old man cried, and then
he let fly a lot of orders to us of the crew which
would have shamed a landsman to utter, for of
a verity no sailor could have understood them.

However, by giving no heed to what he said,
we brought the Avenger into position; but I
soon saw that the tide was setting us away from
the Britisher, and suggested that we let go the
anchor.

To this the old man would not agree.

"Obey orders if you break owners," he said
with a grin, and I knew he had some reason for
thus being so foolish.

However, to make a long story short, we remained
hove to until day dawned, and then we[Pg 113]
were within a cable's length of a large ship,
while a mile or more further up the bay was the
vessel that had first hailed.

"Ahoy on the sloop!" came from the second
ship, and Darius replied in the tone of a countryman:

"Ay, ay, sir."

"Why are you loafing around here?"

"We came down to sell some oysters; but the
chap on t'other craft told us to heave to, an'
we've been driftin' 'round here ever since. I
dunno whether we ought'er go back to him, or
try to sell you what few bushels we've got."

"When did you take them?"

"Last night. Oh, they're fresh enough, if
that's what you're thinkin' of. Don't you want
to try 'em?"

"What is the price?"

"Ten cents a bushel; that's what we ought'er
get up to Baltimore, an' I reckon we might
knock off a little if we don't have to run there
to unload."

Then, without waiting for permission, Darius
began giving us fool orders intended to get the
pungy under way, and we came lumbering around
under the ship's starboard, where we could have
been blown into the next world with no more
labor than the lighting of a match.

Darius lifted one of the hatches and leaped
into the hold ordering us to "bear a hand lively[Pg 114]
that the gentlemen might taste the oysters," and
passing up a basket full, shouting to me so loudly
that he could readily have been heard on the
ship:

"Pass 'em over the side, Bubby dear, an' be
careful how you fool 'round the rail!"

I should have laughed at his manner of speaking
but that I knew he was playing a part, and
I did my best to obey the command.

The sailors of the ship, eager for anything by
way of a change of food, held out both hands
invitingly for the fish, and I contrived to swing
the basket aboard.

Then it was that I saw an officer take charge
of the fish, calling for the after steward to come
forward, and a moment later some one cried:

"Where's your captain?"

I sung out for Darius; but he pretended to
misunderstand, and replied:

"They can have the lot for eight cents a bushel.
Ask 'em if I shall begin takin' 'em out?"

Then it was that I fancied he had some good
reason for wanting to remain out of sight, and
I looked around in alarm to see what had caused
the trouble.



[Pg 115]
CHAPTER VII.

AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.


Jerry was at the tiller; Jim Freeman and his
friends stood near me at the main-hatch ready
to obey the commands of Darius, and since all
hands of us, with the exception of Josiah Coburn,
really were oystermen, knowing no other business
or trade, there was little reason for the
Britishers to have any suspicions regarding us.

It was evident, however, that Darius had seen
something to cause him alarm, otherwise he
would not remain in the hold, having a care to
keep out of sight while he might be seeing much
which would please the commander to hear about.

So far as I could make out, the Britishers regarded
us as ignorant fishermen who were trying
to earn a very slim livelihood by selling
oysters at a price which would hardly pay enough
to provide food for a crew the size of ours.

Three or four of the petty officers were making
very awkward attempts to open the shells with
a marlin-spike, while the idle crew, having nothing
better to do, watched the proceedings on
their ship as well as aboard our craft.[Pg 116]

I was not looking for an explanation of the
old man's behavior among the seamen, therefore
gave little heed to the old shell-backs who lined
the starboard rail from the forecastle-deck to the
mainmast.

Gaze intently as I might, it was impossible to
see anything which could have caused Darius uneasiness,
and I dismissed the matter from my
mind with the belief that he remained hidden
from view simply to avoid being recognized as
an old sailor whom it would pay to impress into
his majesty's service.

It was just when I was growing a trifle more
cheerful in mind because of having banished the
fears which assailed me when the old man leaped
so suddenly into the hold, that one of the officers
called out:

"Here, you Bubby, come aboard and show us
how to open these shell-fish!"

"Will one of your men stand by for our line,
sir?" I asked, because the pungy was bobbing
around on the small waves ten feet or more from
the ship's side, and I was not minded to take the
chances of jumping for the rail when there was
good possibility of landing in the water.

The Britisher said something to the knot of
men forward, and several of them stepped forward,
overhanging the rail, while Jerry made
ready to pass one of the small hawsers.

I stopped only long enough to get one of our[Pg 117]
oyster-knives from the cuddy, and by that time
the Avenger was alongside the ship, rubbing
against the huge fenders which had been swung
out.

At the moment there was no thought of fear in
my mind because I was thus venturing into the
very jaws of the lion; I had it in mind only to
play my part well, and believed that by showing
the gentlemen how easily the shells might be
opened, I would be forwarding our business.

Much to my surprise, when I would have
clambered aboard the ship, whose rail towered
many feet above ours, one of the sailors leaned
far over to give me aid when it was not really
needed. He grasped both my hands in a grip as
of iron, holding me back when it appeared that
he would pull me aboard, and while I was thus
hampered, I heard him whisper:

"Tell Darius Thorpe to be to the eastward of
the Tangiers this night!"

Having thus spoken, he hauled me inboard
quickly, disappearing immediately among the
throng of men which literally covered the ship's
deck.

"Well, Bubby, have you gone daft?"

This aroused me to the consciousness that I
was playing my part very badly, and I quickly
went to the after-hatchway where was our basket
of oysters around which several officers were
standing.[Pg 118]

Without speaking I whipped out the oyster-knife,
and, using the combing of the hatch as a
bench, set about opening the shells as rapidly
as the most expert could have done.

The gentlemen were so astonished at seeing me
do readily what they had failed at, that I had a
good two dozen fat oysters ready for the eating
before any one made an attempt at swallowing
them.

From that out, until the basket was emptied,
I was kept busy, and although I searched with my
eyes while thus engaged, it was impossible to
single out the sailor who had sent the message
to Darius.

When there was nothing before me but shells,
and one of the officers asked if my father was
going to send more aboard, I thought it would be
more in keeping with my part to act like a lad
who was eager to receive money for his cargo,
therefore I replied that we would send the whole
load aboard at the rate of eight cents a bushel.

To this proposition the gentleman agreed, and
I called out for the others to begin slinging the
baskets up, counting on lending a hand to take
them over the rail; but I was not allowed to abandon
my job of oyster-opener.

I worked as lively as I ever did in my life,
and it surely seemed as if I would not be allowed
to go on board the Avenger until the entire cargo
had been eaten, therefore I called for Jerry to[Pg 119]
help me, after our small lot had been dumped on
the ship's hold.

Darius did not come out of the hold. He had
good excuse for remaining there while we were
unloading; but once the pungy was empty I
greatly feared suspicions might be aroused by
his remaining hidden from view.

Not until Jerry and I had opened a full two
bushels, and given one of the cooks a few lessons
in the manner of holding a knife to the best advantage
while shucking, were we allowed to cease
the tiresome labor, for it must be known that we
did not claim to be experts at such work.

One of the officers paid us for the cargo, and
agreed to take as many every other day while
they remained at that station.

As if eager to know how long we might find a
ready market thereabouts, I asked if he could tell
me when there was a possibility of the ship's being
moved; but he shut his mouth as close as any
of our oysters, saying that it was enough for us
to know that they would patronize us while they
remained there, consequently I did not succeed
in getting any information for Commodore Barney.

I explained my reasons for asking such a question,
by saying that it would be a waste of time
for us to sail down the bay when the fleets were
not there, because our only other market was at
Annapolis or Baltimore, and he said with a
laugh:[Pg 120]

"When we're not here you can look for us
further north, and we will take your oysters
wherever we go."

I observed that we were on board the Narcissus,
and thus understood that Darius had made
no mistake when he gave that name to the ship,
therefore my admiration for the old man's knowledge
of nautical matters increased, for only an
experienced seaman could have thus recognized
a craft he had seen but once before.

By setting down so much when our business
was concluded, it would appear as if we loafed
on the deck of the ship some time, whereas we
were given to understand that our room was
better than our company immediately the transaction
was completed, and in a very few seconds
after the officers allowed Jerry and I to cease
the labor of shucking, we were aboard the
Avenger, getting under way.

"Look at the name they've given that old
bargee!" one of the gentlemen on the quarter-deck
cried with a laugh as the pungy swung
around until the letters on her stern could be
read. "These Americans may be hot for vengeance;
but I take notice that they're ready to
feed the enemy if there's a dollar to be made."

All this seemed very funny to the Britishers,
and they cracked many a quip and joke at our
expense, as I guessed by the roars of laughter
which could be heard so long as we were within
earshot.[Pg 121]

Darius came on deck once we had filled away;
but he kept his hat pulled well down over his
face as he walked aft from the main-hatch, and
when he had taken the tiller I asked:

"What were you afraid of that you kept under
cover so close?"

"It was a mighty snug shave, lad," he replied
with a long indrawing of the breath. "I knew
one of the men on the forecastle deck, 'cause I
was shipmate with him on the privateer Honest
Ben, when Joshua Barney was in command. I'm
not sayin' that he'd given me away; but I feared
he might sing out on seein' me."

"What is his name?"

"Bill Jepson. He's a Baltimore man; but
whether he's there owin' to fallin' in with a press-gang,
or on account of his own free will, it's hard
to say, though I never believed Bill would willingly
have served the king."

"He wants you to be to the eastward of the
Tangiers this night," I said, and the old man
started as if he had been struck by a bullet.

"How do you know, lad?"

Then I told him when the sailor had had speech
with me, and again repeated the message.

"That shows as how poor Bill was pressed into
the service," Darius said sympathetically, "an'
now he's countin' that an old shipmate will lend
a hand."

"Which of course you will do!" I cried hotly.[Pg 122]

"We must make some kind of a turn to favor
him; but we're here on the commodore's business,
an' the question is whether we'll be warranted in
doin' what may turn all the plans upside down.
Bill reckons to slip over the side, an' swim ashore.
If we're roundabout here, the Britishers will
count it for certain that we had a hand in the
desertion, an' the Avenger may be taken from us
before we've got well into our work. The king's
officers ain't noways easy in handlin' them as
tries to get the best of 'em."

"But if the man swims for the islands expectin'
to find us, and we're not there, he'll be
retaken."

"Ay, lad, an' most likely dance at the yard-arm
for desertion."

"Then of course we must help him," and I
beckoned to Jerry, knowing full well he would
fall into my way of thinking.

Before anything could be said between my
partner and me, however, the Avenger had come
off the Severn, and we received peremptory
orders to heave to.

"Why didn't you remain alongside, as you were
told?" an officer asked angrily when the pungy
was at a standstill, and Darius replied:

"The current carried us down the bay durin'
the night, an' when mornin' came the captain of
that other ship ordered us alongside, sir. He
bought our cargo an' agreed to take more, so if[Pg 123]
you'd like to trade with us, we can have fifteen
or twenty bushels here by to-morrow night, in
case the wind holds."

I could see that two or three of the gentlemen
on the quarter-deck put their heads together, as
if talking about us, and then the one who had
first spoken ordered us to lay alongside.

"They're goin' to search us, an' it may be I'll
have an invite to stop aboard quite a spell."
Darius said half to himself as he swung
the pungy around preparatory to obeying
orders.

"Then why do we go alongside? It wouldn't
take many minutes to run out of range," I said
excitedly.

"They'd sink us in a twinkling, an' even
though I knew we might give 'em the slip, it
shouldn't be done, 'cause we couldn't come here
again, which never'd suit the commodore."

The possibility that any of our crew might be
pressed into service on board the ship frightened
me, as may be imagined; but I understood even
while making the suggestion, that we could not
hope to escape, and the fate of poor Tom Sackett
was pictured before me.

There was no way out of it, however, but my
knees were very weak when we ranged up under
the starboard guns, waiting like criminals until
his majesty's officers should work their will regardless
of right or wrong.[Pg 124]

Darius was the one who stood in the most
danger, for it could readily be seen that he was
an old sailor; but he never turned a hair. One
would have said to see him that nothing was
more pleasant than to thus be overhauled, and
he made a most awkward flourish by way of a
bow when we were come into position.

Jim Freeman passed a hawser, and when it
was made fast a midshipman, who acted as if
he owned the whole of Chesapeake Bay, came
aboard with two marines.

The little whipper-snapper poked his nose into
the cuddy, and pretended to be nearly overcome
by the odor of the place, therefore he sent the
marines below to overturn everything in the
bunks, as if believing we had somebody hidden
there.

The soldiers came up with our three old muskets,
and the little whifflet demanded in a tone
of authority to be told why we went so well
armed.

"We carry 'em, sir, so's we can get a mess of
ducks now an' then," Darius replied as respectfully
as if he had been speaking to the king.
"They ain't any great shakes of guns, seein's how
all of 'em are rusted pretty bad; but we oystermen
can't afford anythin' better."

One would have thought the little ape had
found three or four thirty-two pounders, by the
way he passed them up over the rail for the in[Pg 125]spection
of the officers on the quarter-deck, and
then he turned his attention to the hold.

I heard the gentlemen laughing as they looked
at our weapons, and in a twinkling the pieces
were thrown down on the deck with so little
care that the hammer of one was broken off
short to the lock, but those who served the king
had little care how they destroyed the property
of those whose crime consisted in being born
Americans.

The midshipman got one whiff from the hold,
which I'm free to admit wasn't pleasing, and the
soldiers were sent below while he stood with a
handkerchief decked out with lace held to his
nose, as if in danger of fainting.

As a matter of course nothing was found below,
save a lot of mud and some oyster shells. A blind
man might have seen that so far as the vessel
was concerned she could be nothing more than
an honest oysterman; but the whifflet forced the
marines to search over every portion of the hold,
and while this was being done one of the officers
asked how many bushels we sold to those of the
Narcissus.

Darius replied to the question, speaking as
nearly unlike a sailor as possible, and not until
he had stated the price, showing British silver
as proof of the amount received, was the curiosity
of the gentleman satisfied.

Then the midshipman clambered over the side[Pg 126]
of the ship to make his report, and the moment
had come when if any of our number were to be
taken from us, we would be made aware of it.

I stood by the side of Darius trembling with
apprehension, and even amid my fear I took note
of the fact that Jerry was feeling far from comfortable
in mind, while the old man chewed incessantly
on a huge piece of tobacco that caused
his cheeks to swell out as if on the point of bursting.

Although we had good cause for being frightened,
nothing came of it, and never did words
sound more sweetly in my ears than when one of
the officers said:

"You can get on about your business; but don't
make the mistake again of trying to get below
us without first reporting."

"We wasn't countin' on goin' very far away,
sir," Darius replied awkwardly. "There's good
fishin' to be found around the islands here, an'
I was reckonin' on gettin' the drags out."

"Very well, but see to it that you heave to
when coming nearabout, and remain until getting
permission to proceed."

"Yes sir, I'll do it for certain," Darius cried,
and as one of the Britisher's crew cast off our
hawser, we filled away, standing to the northeast.

There was not one aboard the Avenger who did
not realize what a narrow escape we had had from[Pg 127]
being forced to serve the king, and I dare venture
to say that all hands drew a breath of relief as
the pungy sailed beyond range of the big guns.

"Where are you bound?" Jerry asked when
he was sufficiently master of himself to note the
course.

"I reckon we'll run over to Pocomoke; we'll
find oysters in that locality, such as they are, an'
there's no need of running too far away from the
market."

"You're goin' to lend Bill Jepson a hand!" I
cried joyfully, for it would have gone far toward
breaking my heart to turn a deaf ear to the poor
fellow's appeal.

"That's just what I ain't so clear about," Darius
replied thoughtfully. "Suppose we talk the
matter over a bit."

I called Jim Freeman and his friends aft,
knowing full well what their opinion would be,
and when we were together, repeated the story as
I had told it to the old man.

Then Darius explained that by helping a sailor
to desert from one of the enemy's ships, we might
get into serious difficulties, to say nothing of losing
the sloop, and he also put it very plainly that
in going outside the task set us, we stood a good
chance of disappointing the commodore.

It was Jerry who put the matter to my liking,
when he said:

"There are chances in favor of our bein' able[Pg 128]
to do this without interferin' with the work set
for us by the commodore; but there isn't much
hope for the sailor if he swims over to the Tangiers
an' fails of findin' us waitin' for him. You
say he'll be hanged if they catch him tryin' to
desert. I don't believe I could sleep well nights
if we should leave this place, an' he met with his
death."

All hands of us felt much as did Jerry, and
after thinking the matter over a moment Darius
said slowly, as if choosing well his words:

"You lads must understand that I'm as hot
for helpin' Bill as you can be; but we're doin' our
little part in a war, an' at such times the life of one
man don't count for very much when the good of
others is concerned. To tell the truth, I couldn't
really say what we ought'er do if I studied the
thing over for four an' twenty hours. You lads
own this 'ere pungy, an' I allow you have the
right to say somethin' as to what shall be done
with her, though you the same as put the craft
out of your keepin' when you took a guarantee
from the commodore that so many dollars should
be paid in case she was lost. We'll consider it
as settled, an' now get to work. Swing out the
drags, an' we'll let the Britishers see that we're
fishin', even though it ain't noways likely we'll
get much here."

I am free to confess that Darius' words made
me a bit uneasy in mind regarding our deciding
the matter, for I knew full well that he had[Pg 129]
spoken no more than the truth. It would be hard
on Bill Jepson if we gave him the cold shoulder;
but by trying to lend a hand we might be doing
others a wrong.

However, the question had been decided, and
there was little sense in crying over spilled milk,
for I was not minded to make any effort at bringing
about a change of opinion, therefore I turned
to with the others that we might appear to be industriously
fishing.

Darius stood to the eastward until we were in
Pocomoke bay, and there we stood a good show
of getting fifteen or twenty bushels before it
would be time to be at the rendezvous appointed
by Bill Jepson.

During all this while we had the enemy's fleets
in fairly good view, for the vessels appeared to be
to the northward of New Point; but, as a matter
of course, it could be of little benefit to the commodore
to know how many vessels there were, if
we could not give him any idea of their weight of
metal.

It was nearly noon before we got breakfast,
and when the meal was come to an end we had
struck some small oyster beds, therefore we were
kept jumping from that time until dark, and then
had on board a good twenty bushels of fair stock.
Not enough from a money-making point of view;
but plenty to serve our purpose, for it might not
be well to let the Britishers think we could take
on a cargo quickly.[Pg 130]

Now the greater portion of this time we were
in view of those aboard the two vessels we had
visited, and by using their spy-glasses it would
have been possible for them to make out what we
were doing.

Once the night began to shut in, however, we
were out of sight, and Darius said as we hauled
in the drags for the last time:

"Now we'll run over for the Tangiers, lads, an'
stay there till two or three o'clock in the mornin'.
If Bill don't show up by that time we must
count that he couldn't get away, or was caught
in the act."

"Are you simply reckoning on laying off the
islands?" I asked, understanding that a man
might swim ashore at one point while we were at
another, and easily fail of finding us.

"I reckon that some of us will take to the
canoe, an' cruise off the western shore lookin' for
him. His best time for makin' the try will be
when the last dog-watch goes off duty at eight
o'clock, or again at midnight. It won't be easy
to paddle 'round so long; but it's a man's life
that you're after."

"Jerry and I will go in the canoe," I said,
thinking it no more than right for us to perform
the greatest share of the labor since we were held,
by Darius, responsible for making the attempt to
aid the sailor.

We made a hearty supper that night, eating the
last of the ham, and frying a generous quantity[Pg 131]
of oysters with it, and then the pungy was hove
to on the westward side of the large island, as
near inshore as we dared to run.

I proposed that she be anchored lest the wind
set her on the beach; but Darius claimed that it
was necessary for us to be ready to leave at a
moment's notice, and promised to have an eye on
the craft all the while we were absent.

Then Jerry and I took to the canoe, with good
prospect of half a night's work before us, and
paddled around to the eastward, after which we
set about going back and forth for a distance of
a quarter of a mile, since that seemed to be the
place a man naturally would make for.

We could see the riding lights of the ship
plainly, and although it would require considerable
labor to swim so far, it should be readily
done by one who was at all familiar with the
work.

"We'd find ourselves in a pretty hobble if a
boat put off from the ship just now," Jerry said
in a low tone, and I was angry with him for having
offered such a suggestion. There was enough
in the venture to make a fellow nervous, without
conjuring up all the possibilities at a time when
one needed to have his wits about him.

"We won't think of anything except trying to
pick the poor man up," I said sharply. "This
isn't the kind of work that suits me, and I'm not
so cold-blooded that I can picture out all the
trouble which may come upon us."[Pg 132]

"A fellow can't help thinkin'," Jerry replied
grumpily, and I said yet more curtly:

"He needn't talk about it to mix others up."
Then, angered with myself for having spoken so
petulantly, I added, "To tell the truth, Jerry,
I am as frightened as a lad well can be, and don't
dare to talk overly much lest I should show the
white feather in a way to make you ashamed of
me."

"You can't be any worse off than I am," my
partner replied, and then we both laughed softly.
An acknowledgment of our timorousness seemed
to hearten us, and we worked the paddles in a
more whole-souled fashion.

As I have said, we decided to pull back and
forth on a line about a quarter of a mile long,
and all the while kept a sharp watch in the direction
of the vessel, for a swimmer's head on the
water is not a very large object to see in the
night.

We did not dare indulge in much conversation,
and during an hour we had not spoken once; but
then I said, thinking to spare ourselves useless
labor:

"If he slipped off at eight o'clock, he should
have been here by this time. We may as well
lay still till midnight."

I had hardly ceased speaking when we heard a
sound as of some one whistling softly, and nothing
more was needed to tell us that Bill Jepson
had succeeded in slipping away from the ship.



[Pg 133]
CHAPTER VIII.

THE DESERTER.


Even after knowing that the deserter was near
at hand, we had considerable difficulty in locating
him, and not until after making a complete
circle around the swimmer could I see his head.

As we came alongside he grasped the gunwale
to rest himself, and asked:

"Are you from the oysterman?"

"Ay, shan't we take you aboard now? The
pungy is on the other side of the island."

"The canoe would be overturned if I attempted
to come over the rail. Paddle into shoaler water,
an' I'll try it."

"Tired out?" I asked as we worked the craft
toward the shore, he still holding by the gunwale.

"Nothin' to speak of when its a case of escapin'
from the Britishers. I'd tried this a week ago
if I hadn't known that the first search would be
made on the island, an' I didn't dare take the
chances of findin' them as would help me off."

We were not many moments in coming to the
beach, and then Bill Jepson clambered over the[Pg 134]
stern, not being hampered overly much by wet
clothing, since he had come off with nothing save
his trousers and shirt.

"I was willin' to leave all my dunnage, providin'
I could say good by to the bloomin' ship.
When we put in here I counted on seein' friends
'most anywhere, for I hail from Baltimore way;
but Darius Thorpe's was the first friendly face
I came across. A good honest sailorman is Darius,
an' I knew he wouldn't leave me in a hole if
it was possible for him to lend a hand."

Jepson had nothing startling to tell relative
to his escape from the ship. When the watch
was changed he quietly slipped over the side,
dropping into the water without making any disturbance,
and swimming beneath the surface,
coming up to breathe only when it was absolutely
necessary, until he was a full half-mile from the
Severn.

As we paddled around the island, putting in
our best strokes, for we had no desire to be found
in that vicinity when it was discovered on the
British ship that one of the crew had deserted, I
asked Jepson how he chanced to be aboard the
enemy's vessel, and while his story related to a
cruel wrong, it was in no wise exciting, or unusual.

Five months before the declaration of war he
was taken from an American merchantman on
the flimsy pretex of being an English citizen, and[Pg 135]
since then had led what he called "a dog's life"
aboard several of the king's ships. Never
before had he seen an opportunity to escape, and
now he knew full well that, if caught, he would
be hanged.

Now that we had the man I began to question
as to what should be done with him, for it was
certain we must not take the chances of keeping
him aboard the Avenger, and I could well
understand that he might not want to remain
if we were to fish in that vicinity.

It seemed almost as if he read that which was
in my mind for he said after a long time of
silence:

"I'm only half free now, for your pungy will
be searched if you go anywhere near the Narcissus
again, an' the question is, how I am to get
to the mainland?"

"We could put you ashore in Maryland," I
suggested.

"Yes, an' I'd starve to death before gettin'
anywhere, unless you ran further up the bay than
I allow you've any right to go," he said with a
laugh which had in it nothing of mirth.

"What's the sense of stewin' over that part of
it now?" Jerry asked. "Wait till you get aboard
the pungy, an' I dare say Darius will have a plan
all worked out."

"He's a good one, is Darius, an' when he settles
on a thing it comes mighty near bein' sound.[Pg 136]
We'll wait, an' I'll spell one of you lads with a
paddle, if you'll give me a show."

"After swimming so far I reckon you'd better
lay still," I replied, and from that time until we
ran alongside the Avenger not a word was spoken
between us.

If I had expected to see anything affecting in
the meeting between the two old shipmates, I was
mistaken.

Darius, who was on the lookout for us as may
be supposed, said when he saw that the canoe
had three occupants:

"So you got him, eh? Well, Bill Jepson
wasn't born to be drowned, that's certain."

Then the old man passed us a line, and the
deserter said as he went over the rail:

"I knew I could depend on you, Darius."

"You made a mistake this time, Bill, for if the
boys hadn't hogged up agin it, I'd left you to do
the best you could, seein's we're down here on a
bit of work for Commodore Joshua Barney,
whose fleet is in the Patuxent river, as perhaps
you have heard."

"Well there! I knew you wouldn't be foolin'
round here oysterin' while able seamen are likely
in good demand. I'd be well fixed if I could run
across the commodore just now."

"That's what I've been thinking'. Of course it
don't stand to reason you can stay here a great
many hours."[Pg 137]

"I must be off before daylight, an' am countin'
on your tellin' me where."

"What do you know about the Britishers?"

"Considerable which has been picked up from
the marines who've been on duty aft. There
won't be any move made for two or three days,
an' then they're goin' to strike Washington an'
Baltimore at the same time. Sir Peter Parker
goes to our home, an' Captain Gordon will run
up the Potomac. Leastways, that's what we of
the gun-deck have heard, an' you know that what
leaks through the sentries is most generally to be
counted on."

"Ever been up the Patuxent river?" Darius
asked abruptly.

"Only two or three times."

"Well that's where you ought'er be, tellin'
the commodore all you know, an' if the three of
you agree, here's a plan we'll try."

Darius looked at Jerry and me as he spoke,
therefore I understood that we were counted as
two of the three to whom he referred.

"I'm agreeable to anythin' you figger out,
Darius," Bill Jepson said as he wrung the water
from his scanty clothing.

"Well then, Amos an' Jerry shall take you in
the canoe, an' start for Nottingham within the
next ten minutes. Since they left to look for
you I've been fixin' up a sail for the craft, an'
with a breeze like this you ought'er be well across
the Potomac by sunrise."[Pg 138]

"Don't you need the lads with you?" Jepson
asked as Jerry and I looked at each other in surprise,
and, perhaps, displeasure.

"Yes; but not so much as I need to hear from
the commodore after he knows what you've got
to say."

"The Britishers are certain to search this craft
'twixt now an' to-morrow night, an' seein' the
canoe is gone, may smell a rat," the deserter suggested.

"I reckoned all that in with my figgerin'. If
you start for the Patuxent river I shall run over
to the Delaware shore an' pick up a boat somewhere."

"They knew how much of a crew you had when
the oyster bargain was made."

"Well, what if the boys went ashore to go home
for a couple of days? That yarn will go down, I
reckon, an' if it don't I'll have to take the chances
for the sake of gettin' you to Joshua Barney as
soon as it can be done."

Darius had evidently considered the plan well,
and I understood that nothing would turn him
from it unless one of us flatly refused to carry it
into execution, which, considering all the importance
of getting information to the commodore,
I was not prepared to do. At the same
time, the idea of going back to Nottingham in no
better craft than our canoe, was by no means to
my liking.[Pg 139]

"If you've got it worked out, Darius Thorpe,
an' allow it should be done, I'm ready," Bill Jepson
said, "an' it ain't noways strange that I
should be willin' to jump at anythin', considerin'
I'm like to go to the yard-arm if captured now."

The old man looked inquiringly at Jerry, and
my partner said slowly much as if not being
exactly certain what he thought of the scheme:

"I'm willin' to go if it so be you want to keep
the pungy here; but 'cordin' to my way of thinkin'
the chances are against our gettin' there in
the canoe."

"You can do it if the wind don't breeze up,
an' it ain't likely to at this time of the year."
Then, as if considering the question settled absolutely,
Darius cried out to Jim, "Have you
stowed everythin' in the canoe?"

"Ay, sir, an' I've taken all the provisions for
them, so we'll be left to suck our thumbs when we
get right hungry."

Darius not only planned the journey while we
were absent; but had gone ahead with the preparations
as if advised in advance that we would
agree to it.

"Well, there was no use in hanging back, since
the thing must be done, and I had sense enough to
know that if we were going to make the venture
the sooner it was begun the better chance we had
for succeeding, therefore I went over the rail into
the canoe, where I found a small sprit-sail, a[Pg 140]
package of food, and one musket with powder
and balls sufficient for two or three charges.

"We've done the best we could by you, lad,"
Darius called out as he saw me examining the
cargo. "You'll soon be where you can lay in
a good supply."

"Yes, if we don't go to the bottom first," I
replied just a trifle sharply, whereat Darius replied
with a laugh:

"I'll trust you for that part of the business.
Bill Jepson should be a master hand with a paddle,
an' take it all in all, you're bound to push
ahead right fast."

"How are we to find you again?" Jerry
asked.

"The commodore will attend to that part of
it. We'll stay here foolin' around as agreed upon,
for a week       unless we get important news before
then       , an' if you haven't shown up I'll allow that
Joshua Barney set you about other business."

Jerry and Bill Jepson took their places in the
canoe, the latter stepping the small spar to which
the bit of canvas was rigged, and as I ran a paddle
out over the stern to take the place of a rudder,
I was astonished at feeling that the little
craft was making remarkably good headway.

Almost at the same moment we started, the
pungy was hauled around for the Delaware shore,
and in less than five minutes she was lost to view
in the darkness.[Pg 141]

"How is she doin'?" the old sailor asked as he
leaned over to watch the rush of water along the
side.

"Better than we could shove her with the paddles,"
I replied, not feeling overly inclined to talk
very much.

"Then I can't see but that everything is as
smooth as grease, an' what's better'n all else,
we're leavin' the bloomin' Britishers astern in
a way to make my heart glad. The wind is likely
to increase before it lessens, so we'll be a good
bit on our way by sunrise."

"Ay," Jerry said grimly; "but if you've lived
in Baltimore you know what the mouth of the
Potomac is when the breeze comes strong, an'
I don't allow that this canoe would make any too
good weather of it in a heavy sea."

"She should be able to do it all right," Jepson
said carelessly, and then he set about filling a
pipe he had borrowed from Darius, as if there was
nothing in the world to cause him trouble.

After he had lighted the tobacco he must needs
ply us with questions regarding Joshua Barney,
to which we could make no very satisfactory replies
because of our ignorance; but he seemed to
think it his duty to keep a conversation going,
regardless of the fact that both Jerry and I
showed plainly our disinclination to do very
much tongue-wagging.

When an hour had passed, and the canoe was[Pg 142]
walking along in right smart style, surprising me
by her performance under sail, for I had never
supposed she could be used in such fashion, Bill
Jepson said suddenly:

"Look here, what's the use of all hands
standin' watch? Give me the paddle, an' I'll
steer while you lads get a bit of sleep. I'll call
you when its time to take your trick at the helm."

At first I was inclined to hold my place; but
thought differently when I saw Jerry curling
himself up in the bow for a nap, and gave the paddle
to the sailor, saying as I did so:

"I don't count on sleeping very long; but if
you should come up to the Potomac before I turn
out, it would be a good idea to call me."

"I reckon you think that because I'm a deep-water
sailor I ain't fit to be trusted with one of
these Chesapeake cockle shells; but bless your
heart, lad, I've always knocked about in 'em,
an' you shall see that I'll handle you tenderly
enough."

I laid down in the bottom of the boat, under the
thwarts, and contrived to make myself so comfortable
that in less than five minutes I was
sleeping soundly.

When next I became conscious of anything
there was at least two inches of water under my
back, and the spray was coming over the starboard
side at a rate that threatened speedily to
founder the little craft.[Pg 143]

Jerry, being in the bow which stood higher out
of the water, had not been disturbed.

"What's the matter?" I asked in alarm, crawling
out from under the thwarts with no little
difficulty.

"Matter? Nothin' as I knows of," Bill Jepson
said as if surprised that I should have asked such
a question. "What made you think anything
was wrong?"

"Why we're half full of water, man, and if it
keeps coming in at this rate it'll soon be a case of
swimming!"

"It's a bit dusty, that's all; but the canoe is
doin' her work like a lady. We're well nigh
across the Potomac, an' just a hummin'."

The day was breaking, and in the gray light of
early dawn I could see the little craft laboring
under her rag of a sail in a manner that sent my
heart into my mouth, although I'm not given to
being timorous on the water.

"We must get in some of that sail," I cried,
forced to yell at the full strength of my lungs
in order to be heard above the rollicking sea song
in which Bill Jepson was pouring forth his musical
soul.

"Let her go as she is; I'll answer for it that
no harm will be done." Bill said with a laugh
as he cut short his song. "We wouldn't be in
as good shape with the paddles, an' that's a fact."

By this time Jerry had awakened, and he, like
[Pg 144]me, had the idea that we were storming through
it at a hotter pace than the canoe could safely
stand; but the sailor insisted that nothing was
wrong, although he did suggest it might be a
good idea if we baled the craft a bit, and we were
forced to act upon his advice in order to save
ourselves from being swamped.

The canoe rode more easily when the liquid
load had been taken from her, and I came to the
conclusion that perhaps it might be as well to let
Bill Jepson have his way since we were cutting
down the miles in great shape, and speed was
the one thing necessary for us just at that time.

We were forced to use the baling dishes about
every ten minutes before crossing the mouth of
the river, and then the little craft made better
weather of it, to the great relief of both us lads.

No one would ever have suspected that Bill
Jepson was a deserter who would surely be
hanged if the Britishers caught him. He sang,
told stories of a wild and terrible kind, mimicked
the officers of the Narcissus, and explained what
the Americans would do when the enemy came up
the bay, going into the details of the naval maneuvers
as if perfectly familiar with all the defenses,
instead of being wholly ignorant of everything
connected with the war save from an English
standpoint.

It was not a very appetizing breakfast which
we had that morning, for the food, stowed in the[Pg 145]
stern of the boat, was soaked with water; but to
lads who had never been accustomed to luxuries
a little thing like fasting did not seem to be of
much importance.

The breeze, which had been freshening all
night, increased with the rising of the sun, and
Jerry and I, unwilling to suggest that the sail
be reefed, saw the little craft humming along under
the guidance of Bill Jepson, when, had we
dared assert our authority, she would be creeping
with no other motive power than the paddles
in the hands of two tired boys.

At noon we landed on the southerly side of Hog
Point, where I knew a fisherman lived, and went
toward the house hoping we might be able to get
something in the way of provisions, for I had in
my pocket the money which had been paid by
the officers of the Narcissus.

Bill Jepson remained in the canoe, to "keep
ship" as he said, and Jerry and I walked through
the small growth of timber nearly encircling the
building, with never a thought of keeping ourselves
concealed from view; but yet remaining
silent for the very good reason that we had
nothing of interest to say to each other.

Thus it was by mere chance that our approach
was almost noiseless, and when we were come
within view of the dwelling, from whence we
could hear the hum of voices, none of the inmates
were aware of our presence.[Pg 146]

This man       Jenkins was his name       had a wife
and one child, as I well knew, therefore hearing
the sound as of several voices, I naturally looked
out from the underbrush before showing myself,
for there was in my mind the thought that he
might have a party of Britishers as visitors.

One man, and he the owner of the dwelling,
was lying on the grass just outside the window,
talking with another who was seated within the
building, whose head and shoulders only could be
seen; but one glance at the face was sufficient
to cause me to draw suddenly back as I motioned
to Jerry to advance where he could have a view
of Jenkins' visitor.

It was Elias Macomber who sat at the window,
talking with his host on the outside, and we
could readily overhear the conversation.

Under ordinary circumstances I hold that an
eavesdropper is the meanest kind of a person;
but considering all the facts of the case, it seemed
just then that it was our duty to learn all we
might.

As we came up Jenkins was evidently opposing
something which the traitor had said, for when
we were in position to listen, Macomber cried
sharply:

"I shall watch out for the British fleet, an'
board the first vessel that heaves in sight. I
reckon I can tell the admiral somethin' which
he'll like to hear."[Pg 147]

"But, Elias," Jenkins remonstrated, "even
though you don't believe in the war, surely you
wouldn't do that which might work harm to your
neighbors?"

"I'm an Englishman!"

"By comin' here an' settlin' down, you turned
into an American, or should have done so. I
claim that a man has no right to hold himself an
Englishman when he moves into another country
to live, never expectin' to go back to the old
home. All your interests are here, an' by holdin'
true to the United States you are benefitin' yourself."

"That's all rot. I work for what I get here,
an' have no man to thank for it."

"But the laws of the country protect you; all
the advantages to be had from the town where
you live are yours, the same as others, an' when
you take them you have no right to do harm to
the land which feeds you."

"It's no use tryin' to argue me out of it, Jenkins,
for you don't know how I've been treated
in Benedict. I'll give the British commander
all the information in my possession, an' it's
enough to be of importance."

Just then a woman's voice from the inside of
the house summoned Mr. Jenkins to some household
duty, and I drew back among the foliage
yet further, dragging Jerry with me.

"We'll stay right here till we get our hands[Pg 148]
on that cur!" my partner exclaimed when we
were so far from the house that there was no
danger the words would be overheard, "an' if
Commodore Barney's men can't keep him a
prisoner, we'll turn to an' see what kind of a fist
we make of the job!"

I was of Jerry's mind; but there was nothing
that could be safely done in broad day, and we
went softly back to the shore that we might hold
counsel with Bill Jepson.

We found the sailor sleeping peacefully on the
warm sand; but had no compunctions about disturbing
his slumbers, and after he was fully
awake it became necessary to tell him the story
of what we had done in the Patuxent, that he
might the better understand the situation.

"So the spy is here, an' counts on stayin' till
the Britishers come up the bay, eh?" the old
sailor said half to himself. "What have you
lads got in your heads?"

"We're goin' to get our hands on him once
more, an' then take precious good care he don't
have a chance to tell the Britishers what he
knows concerning the commodore's fleet," Jerry
said hotly.

"An' you count on doin' that first of all, eh?"

"Sure; that cur shan't have a chance to give
us the slip!"

"But he said he'd stay till the fleet came up."

"Well?"[Pg 149]

"That won't happen for three or four days
yet, if all I've heard be true."

"It makes no difference to us when the vessels
come. What we want is Elias Macomber!"

"What would you do with him, supposin' he
was here this minute?"

"Carry him to Commodore Barney, of course."

"Can the four of us get along in the canoe?"

Jerry and I looked at each other in perplexity.
It was a fact that the little craft would not carry
four, particularly when one was a prisoner who
might struggle against being taken up the river,
and yet it seemed to me as if we were in duty
bound to effect the capture.

"Now this is the way it looks to me," Bill
Jepson said slowly, as if talking with himself,
"though, of course, I ain't countin' on interferin'
with you lads in any way: What I've got to tell
the commodore is of more importance than the
yarn Macomber can spin for the admiral, an' Darius
Thorpe seemed to think I couldn't see the old
man any too soon. Now if this 'ere sneak is
goin' to wait where he is till the fleet comes,
what's to prevent our keepin' on as we started,
an' then comin' back to pull him in? This wind
will set us up the river in great shape, an' within
four an' twenty hours we should be at Nottingham,
unless the town has been moved from where
I saw it last."

I understood at once that the sailor's advice[Pg 150]
was good, and should be followed, yet it went
sadly against the grain to go away from that
place leaving the cur free to do us harm if the
opportunity presented itself.

Jerry had much the same struggle in his mind
as I, but, watching his face, I soon saw that he
was ready to act upon Bill Jepson's suggestion,
and without waiting for him to give his thoughts
words, I said:

"Very well, if we're to go up the river first,
there is no time to be lost. We must paddle the
canoe close inshore until we get around the point,
so that we may not be seen from Jenkins' house,
and then we'll push her for all she's worth."

We no longer remembered that we were hungry;
but jumped to the task as if every moment
was precious, as indeed was the case if we would
make Elias Macomber a prisoner for the second
time.

As I had said in regard to paddling around the
point, so we did, but once the canoe was so far
beyond that she could not be seen from the dwelling,
we hoisted the sail, and I dare venture to
say that Bill Jepson might have run her rail under
without hearing any word of protest from
Jerry or me, so eager were we to be on the return
voyage.



[Pg 151]
CHAPTER IX.

AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.


It was as if the elements favored us in the race
to Nottingham and indeed I counted it a race in
which were pitted against us the British fleet and
Elias Macomber.

The wind held strong, the day was cloudless,
and the canoe, clumsy craft as I had always
looked upon her, sailed like a bird. Bill Jepson
insisted on holding the steering paddle, and we
were well content to have him at the helm, for
he held her so nearly to the course that our wake
stretched out behind us straight as an arrow.

Under almost any other circumstances we
would have made at least a short stop at Benedict;
but now it was out of the question, and we
sailed by at full speed, being hailed by several
of our acquaintances who urged that we come to
for a moment, but we resisted all such entreaties.

I knew that my mother, on being told we had
refused even to so much as have speech with our
friends as we passed, would understand we were[Pg 152]
on urgent business, and have no thought that I
had slighted her.

When, in due course of time, we passed the
mill from which had been taken the prisoners, it
bore the appearance of being deserted, therefore
we had good reason for believing that Macomber
was the only one of our capturing who succeeded
in making his escape.

It was late in the night before we came upon
the fleet, and were brought to by a hail from the
guard-boat.

The commodore was yet with the flotilla on
board the Scorpion, so the sentinels told us; but
they were minded to prevent our having speech
with him at that unseemly hour.

Had Jerry and I been alone I believe of a verity
we would have been forced to wait until morning
before seeing Joshua Barney; but Bill Jepson
could not be put aside as easily as two lads, and
he roared out as if he had been an admiral of
the blue at the very least:

"Tell him that Darius Thorpe has sent word
from the lower bay, an' it must be delivered
straight away."

In the darkness, when it was impossible to see
him, no one could say that Bill was not a person
of the greatest importance, and the sentinels,
judging from his voice, must have concluded that
he, or the man whose name he gave, was some
one high in authority, therefore they not only al[Pg 153]lowed
us to approach the schooner, but went before
to announce our arrival.



      I remember your face, my man;       said the Commodore.
      Come aboard at once.       Page 153.


The commodore was not the kind of an officer
to keep any one in waiting simply that due respect
might be shown to his station; but came on
deck half-dressed, bidding one of the sailors to
hold a lantern that he might see who we were.

"So you lads have come back in haste, eh?" he
said, on recognizing Jerry and me. "Have you
by chance lost the pungy?"

"No, sir; she is in the lower bay oysterin', with
Darius in charge," I made haste to say.

"And who is this you have with you?"

"Bill Jepson, sir, who has served under you
twice; but is now a deserter from his majesty's
ship, Severn, having been pressed into the British
service nigh to three years ago," the sailor replied,
rising to his feet at imminent risk of overturning
the canoe.

"I remember your face, my man. Come
aboard at once, all hands of you."

We clamored over the rail, having made the
canoe fast, and entered the commodore's cabin.

"When did you desert from the Severn?"
Joshua Barney asked, showing more of excitement
than I had ever seen him display.

"Last night, sir, an' it may be by so doin' I've
upset some of your plans; but when I asked for
help it never struck me that Darius might be
there on special business."[Pg 154]

"Tell me all the story," the commodore said,
motioning toward me, and without delay I gave
him a full account of what we had done, save
that then I said nothing regarding Elias Macomber.

Then he questioned Bill Jepson regarding what
he knew, and, if I am any judge of such matters,
he got considerable valuable information.

The sailor was able to give him the names of
nearly all the vessels in the two fleets, together
with their probable weight of metal, and repeated
the gossip which had leaked from the Severn's
cabin through the marines on guard.

The commodore listened intently, making
many notes as Bill spun his yarn, and when it
was come to an end he said:

"You did well to steer for here at once; but
I am inclined to believe that the enemy will move
very soon. Is there anything else to be said?"

"I would like to speak about Elias Macomber,
sir?" I made bold to say.

"That was the prisoner who escaped? One
of them got away, and there is good reason to
suspect that he received aid from some of our
men. We have no time to look into the matter
now; but it shall be thoroughly sifted later, and
if there be a British sympathizer among us, it
will go hard with him."

Then I gave him all the information we had
concerning the traitor, and wound up by asking[Pg 155]
if there was any reason why we should not go
back and re-take the cur.

"You may as well make the attempt, although
I question if he can tell the enemy anything
which is not already known. The utmost he
could say would be that our force is small, and
so much the British learned at St. Leonard's
bay. However, I would like to have the fellow;
but am not willing you should run into any
danger for the purpose of effecting the capture."

"I believe that Jerry and I will be able to
get hold of him, and we will go back at once,
unless you have other work for us."

"There is nothing especial that you can do
here. Warn Darius Thorpe to be ready for an
immediate move on the part of the enemy, and
tell him to make sail for the Patuxent at the
first signs of activity. You lads had better get
some sleep before setting off again. Go forward,
and see that you have a hearty meal at once.
Jepson, you will remain aboard the schooner."

Bill thanked the commodore, and the three
of us went into a sort of forecastle which had
been rigged up in the forward part of the vessel,
where, after considerable arguing, we succeeded
in getting so much food as satisfied our hunger,
which was no small amount.

Then we turned in by lying down on deck,
which was preferable to getting into a bunk on
such a hot night.[Pg 156]

As a matter of course we were aroused right
early, even before any signs of a new day could
be seen; but the three hours of sleep refreshed
us wonderfully, and we were ready to set off
down the river.

We managed, at the expense of considerable
argument, to get a supply of provisions from the
cook without awakening Commodore Barney,
and, after a warm parting with Bill Jepson, cast
off the canoe.

Because the wind was blowing straight up
the river it was impossible to use a sail, save
at the cost of considerable time, and we took to
the paddles, which seemed like mighty hard work
after our experience with the rag of a sail.

Don't let it be thought that we begrudged
our labor; I would have paddled till the skin
was worn from both hands for the sake of re-taking
Elias Macomber, and looked pleasant
all the while; but when a fellow has been flying
over the water with no effort of his own save to
keep the little craft on her course, he cannot but
contrast that pleasure with the dreary work of
shoving her ahead with an ashen blade.

Again we felt obliged to pass our homes without
stopping. It would have taken a full hour,
hurry as we might, to go ashore and speak ever
so briefly with those who would greet us, and
in that length of time Elias Macomber could,
possibly, join his friends the Britishers.[Pg 157]

"We'll keep well over on the eastern shore,
where there is less chance of bein' seen, an' do
our best at the paddles," Jerry said as we discussed
the matter just before coming within
sight of the village. "I'd give a good deal to
see mother an' the children; but it seems as if
we had no right to loiter."

I was of his mind, and we hugged the opposite
bank of the river, keeping under the screen of
foliage as much as possible, until there was no
danger of being recognized.

During all that day and far into the night
we paddled. Now and then one would stop to
rest his arms; but the other continued the labor,
therefore the canoe did not come to a stop from
the time we left the fleet until we were arrived
at Hog Point.

There we run her bow on the shore while we
ate a hearty meal, and discussed the question as
to whether it would be better to approach the
house from the northerly or the southerly side.

I was in favor of going ashore where we then
were; but Jerry won the day by suggesting that
if we ran around on the other side, it would be
possible to see if the British came up the bay,
and this last was quite important to us in case
we were forced to spend much time waiting for
a fitting opportunity to catch our game.

After refreshing ourselves with food, we
paddled around the point without danger of[Pg 158]
being seen, because it was so late in the night,
and landed at the same place as before, knowing
that from there we would have no difficulty
in finding the dwelling.

After pulling the canoe up amid the bushes,
and hiding her as well as was possible in the
darkness, we laid down on the ground, falling
asleep almost immediately we had stretched ourselves
out at full length, and not until the first
beams of the rising sun shone across our faces
did we awaken.

It was but natural that we should look down
the bay before doing anything else; but we saw
nothing to disturb us. A small craft was coming
slowly up, for the breeze was light; but to
her we gave little or no heed.

We began the day by eating breakfast. Then
we saw to it the boat was so nearly concealed by
the foliage that she would not be seen save after
careful search, and we set out to reconnoiter the
premises.

We advanced cautiously, stopping every half
dozen paces to listen lest we inadvertently
stumble upon the owner of the plantation, or
his guest, and after spending half an hour in
such slow progress, we came in view of the place.

Elias Macomber was pacing to and fro in
front of the dwelling, as if weary of his voluntary
confinement, and gazing seaward every few
seconds, for from that side of the house it must[Pg 159]
have been possible to get a full view of the bay.

"We might get our musket, an' rush up on
him now," Jerry whispered, and I replied as I
believed Darius would have done:

"We don't know how well armed Jenkins may
be, nor what he will be willing to do in aid of
his friend. My idea is that we should wait here
until the owner goes to his work, leaving the
traitor with the women folks, and even then the
task won't be an easy one, for we must come
out in sight of all hands a full three minutes
before arriving at the house, however fast we
run."

"We should have brought the musket with us
on this trip," Jerry grumbled, and I soothed him
by saying:

"There is really no time lost. The first thing
to be done was to make certain the scoundrel
yet remained here; that has now been ascertained,
and I will go for the weapon while you stand
watch. We mustn't be in too much of a hurry,
or we may spill the soup."

Jerry was satisfied to act as sentinel, and I
walked leisurely back to the shore, believing that
much time must elapse before we would get the
desired opportunity.

Arriving at the shore I spent some minutes
searching for the canoe, so well had we hidden
her, and once getting the musket and ammunition
in my possession I strolled down to the
beach where I could have a view of the bay.[Pg 160]

Only the single small vessel was in sight, and
I was on the point of turning away, thinking it
useless to gaze long at her, when something in the
rig of the craft struck me as being familiar.

I looked again; laid down the weapon and
gazed yet more intently, until finally there was
no longer any question in my mind.

The vessel was none other than the Avenger!
If Darius was yet on board why had he left his
post of duty? If anything had happened to him,
why had Jim Freeman taken it upon himself
to leave the lower bay?

The more I tried to solve the problem the
stronger became the probability, in my own mind,
that some serious disaster had overtaken our
comrades, and I ran at full speed, giving little
heed as to whether the advance might be heard
by Macomber, until I was come to where Jerry
remained crouching in the grass, his eyes fixed
upon the dwelling.

"You're makin' a terrible row!" he said
angrily, never looking around. "Fortunately
the cur has just gone inside, or he might have
heard you."

"Jerry!" I said, speaking with difficulty because
of heavy breathing after having run so
fast. "The Avenger is close at hand; she is the
craft we saw! Something must have gone
wrong!"

Jerry turned his head very quickly now, for[Pg 161]getting
for the instant his desire to make a prisoner
of Elias Macomber.

"What do you think can have happened?"
he asked, and I replied impatiently:

"That we shall only find out by boarding her.
Come to the beach at once!"

"But what about our work here?" and now
it was the pungy that went from his mind, leaving
there only the great desire to accomplish
the purpose for which he had come.

"Never mind that now! It may be we won't
want to fool around here on his account! Come
quickly, Jerry, for she was close at hand before
I started!"

It was actually necessary to shake the lad before
I could arouse him to a full sense of the situation;
but once that had been done, he followed
me readily enough, even urging that I move
faster.

The pungy was no more than half a mile away
when we reached the shore, and we launched
the canoe without delay, paddling straight out
in her course.

As she came up I could see Darius at the tiller,
with Jim beside him, and the other two fellows
lounging forward.

Nothing had happened to the crew, that much
seemed certain, and I was at my wits' end to
account for the Avenger being apparently heading
for home.[Pg 162]

When we were come within hailing distance
I shouted, never thinking that I might be heard
by those on the Jenkins plantation:

"Why are you coming back? What has
happened?"

"Where is Bill Jepson?" Darius cried.

"With the fleet."

"When did you leave him?"

"Yesterday. What is the matter?"

"Come aboard an' I'll tell you," the old man
replied as he threw the pungy up into the wind,
and we did not waste many seconds in going
over the rail.

"Now what is it?" I asked impatiently when
I stood facing Darius.

"The Britishers are gettin' under way, an' it
kind'er looked as if the oyster business wouldn't
be any good after they'd left moorin's. If there'd
been any wind, you'd be seein' 'em by this time.
What brought you ashore at Hog Point?"

"Elias Macomber is there, living with Jenkins
the planter. We stopped on our way up
thinking to get some provisions, and not only
saw the cur, but heard him say he was waiting
for the Britishers, to whom he could give a lot
of information."

While I had been speaking Darius brought
the pungy into the wind again, and she was
standing directly away from the man we had
been so eager to capture.[Pg 163]

"Here!" Jerry cried sharply. "You must
heave to till we get that villain."

"How many people do you reckon are in the
house?" Darius asked as he twisted off a large
piece of tobacco.

"We've only seen Macomber and Jenkins."

"Don't know anythin' more about the situation?"

"We haven't had time to learn anything more;
but it don't stand to reason there are other men."

"They've both of 'em got wives, who'd fight
if it come to a pinch. No, lads, the best you could
count on in the way of time would be a full day,
an' we can't afford to waste an hour."

"But it wouldn't be wastin' time if we finally
caught him," Jerry cried hotly.

"That's where I don't agree with you, lad.
The son of a sea-cook can't give the Britishers
any very valuable information, whereas we can
tell the commodore that which may be the means
of savin' our whole fleet. I'd like to lay Macomber
by the heels as well as you would; but
I don't believe in usin' a salmon to catch a sprat.
We'll run across him some day; but jest now its
our duty to get up the river in short order.
We'll try the canoe with a little bigger canvas,
an' if she sails faster than the pungy you
shall go ahead, for an hour now is worth a full
day next week."

I was not convinced that the business of catching
the traitor before he could give his informa[Pg 164]tion
to the Britishers, was less important than
that of carrying to the commodore word of preparation
for departure on the part of the fleet,
more particularly since not a vessel had as yet
hove in sight; but when it came to arguing a
point with Darius I generally got the worst of
it, therefore I held my peace, although it went
sadly against the grain to do so.

Jerry did not give in so readily; but insisted
on heaving to the vessel, declaring that he and
I would do the work alone, while the Avenger
went on up the river.

"You'll do nothin' of the kind, lad," Darius
said emphatically. "There's no tellin' what
Joshua Barney will decide on when he hears the
word I have for him, an' I don't count to leave
you down here at Hog Point to be gobbled up
by the Britishers, for you're already under suspicion
of havin' had a hand in Bill Jepson's desertion."

"What do you mean?" I asked in surprise.

"Jest what I said. The officer from the Severn
declared that you two lads could tell what had
become of Bill."

"I had actually forgotten that we aided a
deserter," I cried. "Tell us what happened after
we left the Avenger?"

"Well," Darius said slowly, stopping to twist
off a huge piece of tobacco, and otherwise trying
to make his yarn a long one so that we might[Pg 165]
round Hog Point in the meanwhile. "We run
over to the Delaware shore, as I counted on doin',
tryin' to find a boat; but it was no go. We didn't
see anythin' that would float, an' of course we
couldn't fool 'round there very long after sunrise,
else the Britishers would see us, so I made
up my mind that the best plan was to face the
music right soon.

"We ran down for the Narcissus; but was hove
to by the Severn, an' a lieutenant with four
marines came aboard. Bless your heart, lad,
but they did search the pungy from stem to
stern, even shovelin' the oysters over as if thinkin'
we might have Bill under 'em. Then the officer
went on board, an' that little nincompoop of a
midshipman boarded us. 'Where's your crew?'
he squeaked, an' I said innocent like, 'They're
all aboard, sir.' 'You're a liar!' says he, 'when
I was here last there were five lads on deck, an'
now I see only three.' 'Oh the other fellows
have gone home,' says I. 'They only came out
with us for a lark.' 'Where's your boat?' says
he. 'She belonged to them,' says I. 'You're
a liar,' says he. 'Yes, sir,' says I, which same
was true, an' off he goes madder'n a wet hornet.

"Then the lieutenant comes aboard after I
saw a lot of 'em on the quarter-deck talkin'
fit to kill, an' he asks me when you went home.
I told him you lived on the Delaware shore, an'
you skipped when the pungy got near shore.[Pg 166]
'You're a liar,' says he, an' I agreed with him
same's I had with the midshipmite. 'The boys
have helped a deserter from the Narcissus,' says
he, 'an' have carried him to the mainland. I've
a mind to seize your vessel.' I tell you what
it is, lads, 'bout that time I thought the Avenger
was a goner, for Britishers in American waters
are mighty apt to do whatever comes into their
minds."

"Well, did that settle it?" I asked as Darius
ceased speaking, much as though his story had
come to an end.

"No, we had three or four officers come aboard
later, an' I ain't certain but that we'd lost the
pungy if signals hadn't been sent up on the flag-ship,
which I took to be a command to prepare
for gettin' under way. Leastways, them as was
botherin' us scuttled over to their own craft in
short order, an' then there was a heap of knockin'
about in gigs an' barges, with nobody givin' any
attention to us. We'd been hove to half a musket
shot from the ship, an' when I saw they had
other fish to fry an' plenty of 'em, I run close
aboard as I yelled like a countryman, 'Any
orders for us, sir?' It was quite a long spell
before anybody answered, an' I'd sung out two
or three times, when that little midshipman
squealed, 'You are to go about your business
with that pungy, an' we'll overhaul you again
when we have more time!"

"Then you started for the Patuxent the best[Pg 167]
you knew how," I said, thinking I understood just
what should have been done under the circumstances.

"I wasn't such a bloomin' fool," Darius replied.
"We run down to the Narcissus bold
as lions, an' I told 'em we'd brought some more
oysters; but they threatened to fire into us if
we didn't sheer off, an' then I coaxed for 'em to
take what cargo I had, offerin' to sell at six
cents a bushel, till they must have thought I was
a stark natural fool."

"But why didn't you get away when you had
the chance?" Jerry asked in surprise.

"I didn't want 'em to think I was anxious to
go, an' meanwhile I had my eye on what they was
doin', which told plain as the nose on your face
that the signals were as I had thought. I almost
cried when I said I'd have to run all the way to
Baltimore to sell the oysters, an' the best I got
from them was more threats. Then we could
steer straight up the bay without givin' rise
to suspicion that we was jest naturally hankerin'
to come."

"You played a fine trick on 'em!" I cried,
filled with admiration at the old man's method
of getting away from unpleasant neighbors. "It
couldn't have been done better."

"I'm not so certain of that," Darius replied,
but I could see that he was pleased by the praise.
"I didn't have time to think up anythin' different,
for the whole business come about so sudden[Pg 168]
like. Howsomever, we've got news that Joshua
Barney needs to hear, an' our cruise to the lower
bay will pay if we can get to Nottingham half
a dozen hours ahead of the Britishers, which
seems to be a settled thing with this wind."

Then I told him that the commodore felt convinced
the enemy would advance sooner than
was generally believed, and he said in a tone
of admiration:

"There's a man for you! He can smell more'n
the most of folks can see, an' when he says it's
in his mind that a thing is so or so, you can set
it down as comin' mighty near to bein' a fact."

Then the old man asked concerning our interview
with the commodore, and by the time we
had come to an end of our story Hog Point was
so far astern that there was no longer any
thought in my mind of returning.

I was trying to make the best of the situation,
when Jerry said fretfully:

"It was a big shame that we couldn't have
taken Elias Macomber when he was there ready
to drop, like a ripe peach. We might have
walked right up to that house when we first
saw him, an' the thing could have been done."

"But we mightn't have walked back again,
if there had happened to be two or three more
in the building than we counted on. Never mind,
Jerry, we'll have the traitor before we're many
weeks older, and what's more, we'll take him ourselves,
never asking any man for assistance."



[Pg 169]
CHAPTER X.

A CHANGE OF BASE.


When we were come near Benedict I was not
minded to pass it for the third time without
stopping to see my mother, and I said to Darius:

"There seems to be no good reason why Jerry
and I should not visit our homes, leaving you to
continue on with the news. We can take the
canoe, and paddle up the river to-night."

"It is your place to remain aboard the Avenger,"
the old man said almost sharply.

"What can we do more than would be done
by you?" Jerry asked in surprise.

"Nothin', so far as sailin' up the river is concerned;
but with the news we're takin' to the
commodore, it is more'n likely there'll be a quick
change, when you might be needed."

"There can't be anything very serious happen
'twixt now and to-morrow morning," I persisted,
yet holding to my scheme. "We wouldn't be
more than twelve hours behind you under any
circumstances."

"Not if everything was in your favor; but how[Pg 170]
if you met a boat-load of Britishers such as we
captured the other night? It ain't safe to be
foolin' 'round the river alone just now, an' that's
a fact."

"Meaning that there is more of fear in your
mind lest we come upon spies of the enemy, than
expectation Commodore Barney might need our
services?" I asked, and the old man finally admitted
that perhaps such was the case.

Then, in my pigheadedness, I declared we
would stop in the village, and he gave proof of
what he could do when things did not go exactly
to his liking.

"I shall stop you from leavin' the pungy!"
he said doggedly, without looking towards us.

"Do you mean to say, Darius Thorpe, that
you'd prevent us from goin' ashore?" Jerry
cried hotly.

"That's exactly the size of it, lad. I never'd
let a shipmate of mine run his nose into danger
when there was nothin' to be made by so doin'."

"But how would you stop us?" Jerry asked,
his anger rapidly giving way to mirth as he pictured
to himself Darius, the man whom we
had hired to help us in the fishing, setting himself
up to say what we should or should not do.

"I'd knock you down, with a belayin' pin if
it was handy, but if not, with my fist, knowin'
Joshua Barney would uphold me in bringin' back
at any price the same crew I took away."[Pg 171]

I felt certain that the old man believed it
his duty to do exactly as he had said, in case we
persisted in going contrary to what he thought
was prudent, and I also came to realize that to
his mind the danger was great, otherwise he
never would have spoken in such a strain.

However, I did not let him know what was in
my mind; but stood well forward when we sailed
past Benedict, as if I was too angry to have
further speech, and, probably, acted like a sulky
school-boy thinking that I was upholding my
dignity.

When we had run past the village, however,
and there was no longer any possibility Jerry
and I would attempt to go ashore, Darius humbly
asked us to come aft, and once there he explained
in a friendly way why we, who had virtually
bound ourselves to serve under Commodore
Barney, should report to him before attending
to pleasure or personal matters. He also made
it plain that at this time, when we knew beyond
a peradventure the enemy was about to
make an attack, it was absolutely necessary every
American who had agreed to aid in the defense,
should be ready for duty at a moment's notice.

In fact, he showed us so clearly that he was
in the right and we wrong, that I was ashamed of
having given way to the sulks, and told him so,
whereat he said:

"Then we'll drop the whole thing right out[Pg 172]
of our minds, an' now that it's over, I'll bet you
two or three cents' worth of silver spoons that
we'll be in Benedict on service, sent there by the
commodore, before four an' twenty hours have
passed."

I would have asked him how that might be,
but just then Jim Freeman sung out for me to
have a look at the cable, which was considerably
chafed, and I did not get an opportunity of continuing
the conversation.

Again we came up to the fleet in the night;
but Darius did not hold any long parley with the
occupants of the guard-boat who hailed us,
simply saying as he steered the Avenger straight
for the Scorpion:

"Private service for the commodore."

We ran alongside the schooner, made the
hawser fast ourselves, since the single militiaman
standing guard at the top of the cabin companion-way
did not see fit to aid us, and while
this was being done Darius leaped on board the
vessel, saying in a loud tone:

"We're come on board to report to the commander."

"You can't see him now," the soldier said
stiffly, presenting his musket as if intending to
use it in case the old man persisted in advancing.

"Now look here, you lop-sided lobster," Darius
cried at the full strength of his lungs, "you[Pg 173]
report to the commodore that the Avenger is
alongside, or there'll be trouble 'twixt you an'
me."

It is not probable the old man expected that
he could bully the sentinel, who had had his orders
as a matter of course; but by bawling so
loudly that he could have been heard on every
craft of the fleet, he awakened Joshua Barney,
which was exactly what he aimed at doing.

"Who's kickin' up this row?" the commodore
asked sternly as he poked his head above the
hatchway.

"The crew of the Avenger, sir, come to report."

"Get below here at once," and the commander
spoke as if impatient to hear that report.

I had counted that Darius should go alone to
the interview; but he insisted on being accompanied
by Jerry and me, therefore we followed
him into the cabin.

The old sailor did not spend much time in
saluting; but in the fewest words possible told
what he had learned, and the commodore did
not appear surprised by the information.

"It tallies with what I have already heard,"
he said grimly. "How long will it take the
enemy to run up to the mouth of the river?"

"They should be there to-morrow night, for
there are some fast sailers in the fleet, sir."

"Find the swiftest canoe in the fleet; put on
board rations for twenty-four hours, getting[Pg 174]
them from this schooner, and run down the river
without delay. If your own crew is not huge
enough to insure quick work, call on for what
men you need. Can you leave in thirty
minutes?"

"In five, sir, if we knew where to find the
canoe. We're ready, an' I'll keep the same crew."

The commodore ran on deck, hailed the guard-boat,
spoke a few words in a low tone, and returned
to us, saying as he did so:

"Rout out my cook, and tell him what you
want. Say that I give him five minutes in which
to have your provisions on deck. If necessary,
in order to learn all which should be known here,
send a portion of your crew back with the boat,
and do the remainder of your work ashore. In
case I am not here when you get back, report to
Lieutenant Frazier, and take his orders as you
would mine."

All this the commander had said hurriedly,
as if the moments were precious, and, having
come to an end, he began writing at the table,
giving no more heed to us than if we never had
an existence.

We left the cabin without delay, and while
Darius went forward to have speech with the
commodore's cook, Jerry and I clambered on
board the pungy to let Jim and his friends know
of the new duty to which we had been assigned.

"Its a case of keeping on as spies," I[Pg 175]
said, after repeating the commander's words.
"You're to be ready at once; but who's to look
after the Avenger is something that hasn't been
told us."

There was no time to say anything more, for
at that point the guard-boat came alongside,
having in tow a long canoe which looked as if
a single stroke of the paddle might send her on
a long voyage.

"Here is the swiftest craft on the river, and
her owner's heart will be broken if you allow
the Britishers to get hold of her," the officer in
charge of the boat said as he passed me the
painter of the canoe.

"Do you know what we are to do with the
pungy?" I asked.

"My orders are to anchor her further up
stream after you have gone. Don't leave anything
valuable aboard, for there's a good chance
you'll never see her again."

"We don't own anything valuable, except the
pungy herself, and I fancy she wouldn't be very
precious save to two lads like Jerry and me who
may never own one again if anything happens
to her," I said with a laugh, for, strange to say
now, when we were about to set off on the most
dangerous portion of our work, I failed to feel
the slightest fear.

At this moment Darius and the commodore's
cook came on deck, each bearing in his arms a[Pg 176]
certain amount of cooked food, and this the old
sailor threw without care into the bottom of
the new canoe, himself following with the utmost
haste.

"Come on, lads, if you count on gettin' any
sleep this night," he cried impatiently as he took
up one of the paddles.

"Are we to go without weapons?" I asked.

"We shan't need them. If we meet the
Britishers it will be in such force that half a
dozen of the best rifles ever made would do us
no good, and there will be none others on the
river with whom we shall want to interfere."

"But we might run across Elias Macomber,"
I urged, not minded to go empty-handed on such
a perilous voyage.

"It is too late to fool around with spies now,"
Darius said sharply. "They've done us all the
mischief possible, an' it's a case of standin' before
an open enemy."

I had no desire to argue further within hearing
of the commodore, and scrambled down into
the boat, where my comrades were seated ready
to begin the voyage.

Now indeed was Darius the leader of the party,
and after the conversation in regard to the
muskets, I was prepared to obey him without a
murmur.

It is a large canoe which will carry six people
comfortably, without sign of being overloaded,[Pg 177]
yet the boat we were in did it, and I would not
have hesitated to put in a couple more had it
been necessary, while she paddled as easily as
a craft half her size.

"It's a great little boat," Darius said approvingly
as we began the voyage with a burst of
speed which absolutely surprised me. "I reckon
we could show our heels to the best that can be
found on the river."

"Where are we goin'?" Jim Freeman asked,
impatient to know more regarding our purpose.

"That's what I can't say, lad. We'll run down
till we see somethin' of the Britishers, even
though we come off the Tangiers again; but I'm
thinkin' we'll do well if we make Hog Point this
trip."

Jim would have asked more questions; but
that Darius cut him short by saying gruffly:

"There's a decently good reason for believin'
that the enemy may show himself any minute
now, an' if we don't want to get into trouble
it'll be safe to hold our peace. There'll be plenty
of time for tongue-waggin' later."

It can be fancied that we remained silent
after such a remark and the old man kept
four of us at the paddles constantly, himself
doing twice as much work as any other, while
the helmsman occupied that post only in order
to rest himself, the steering blade being shifted
from one to the other accordingly as we grew
tired.[Pg 178]

For the fourth time we passed Benedict without
making a stop, but on this occasion I made
no protest, and when we had run a mile further
down the river we came upon a pungy belonging
to our village, the master of which was evidently
doing his best to get all the speed possible
out of the craft.

"Better put back!" he shouted nervously,
and Darius gave the word to cease paddling as
he asked:

"What's the news?"

"The Britishers are comin' this way thicker'n
spatter, an' I made up my mind it was time to
get under cover."

"Where were the foremost ships when you
saw them?"

"Less'n a mile below Hog Point; it looked
like there was more'n a hundred vessels."

"You'd better not count on stoppin' long at
Benedict," Darius cried as he motioned for us to
take up the paddles again, and before the captain
of the pungy had time to ask a question,
we were beyond earshot.

"It may be the fleet that's bound for Baltimore,"
I suggested, not being prepared at that
time to believe the enemy would attempt to take
large vessels far enough up the river to disturb
our fleet.

"I allow some of 'em are headin' Baltimore
way," Darius replied grimly; "but you'll find[Pg 179]
that a good many of the fleet will make a try
at stirrin' up Joshua Barney."

I knew the old man believed all he said, because
from this out when we were come to a
bend in the river we would steer the canoe close
up to the bank, and slow down until he made
certain that the next reach did not have in it
any of the enemy's craft.

In this cautious manner we ran down stream
perhaps five miles below Benedict, when, on
rounding a bend, we saw no less than four armed
vessels, with a dozen or fourteen barges, not more
than a mile away.

"Back water, lads!" Darius cried sharply,
swinging the canoe's stern around with the steering
paddle. "Here's where we find our work.
I'd like it better if you wasn't so nearly fagged
out; but I reckon we can make five miles more
before you give in."

He had turned the canoe while speaking, and
we were running up stream in less than two
minutes after having sighted the Britishers.

"Five miles should bring us to Benedict," I
suggested.

"Ay, lad, an' that's where we'll make the
first stop."

"But do you count that the enemy will get
as far up as the village?" I asked in surprise
mingled with no little consternation, for this was
bringing the war home to us with a vengeance.[Pg 180]

"Some of the ships may find the bottom; but
they'll get a few of 'em there. Take the helm,
Amos, an' I'll pull at the paddles."

Thus far, since we took service under Commodore
Barney, all of Darius' predictions had
turned out to be correct, therefore I was fully
prepared to believe all he said regarding the
danger which threatened my native village.

The old man would not allow us to indulge
in conversation after the retreat was begun.

"Don't waste your breath by talkin'," he said
peremptorily. "We'll need all our wind to take
us to Benedict, an' once there I'll give some of
you a chance for tongue-waggin'."

Within two miles of the village we passed
the pungy we had met while going down stream,
going by her as if she was standing still, and
Darius shouted:

"Keep right on up the river! The Britishers
won't stop this side of Benedict, an' you can
only save your vessel by joinin' Barney's fleet."

"If all I've heard be true I'm as like to lose
her where he is as in most any other place,"
the captain cried, looking here and there
anxiously as if believing it possible he might
find a few puffs of wind lying around loose.

I was in good shape when we arrived finally
at the village, because of having remained at
the steering paddle; but the other fellows were
well-nigh exhausted, and when we ran the bow[Pg 181]
of the canoe up on the shore, not one of them
made a move toward changing his position.

"Get your wind, lads, as soon as may be, for
we'll pull half a mile or more up-stream before
settlin' down here for any length of time," the old
man said, leaping ashore smartly as if he had
just awakened from the most refreshing slumber,
and while hurrying up the bank he added sharply,
"Stay where you are, all hands, until we finish
this business."

What it was he counted on finishing I could
not so much as guess, and my companions were
too weary to speculate upon the matter just at
that moment.

We saw him speak with this or that person
who came out of the shops or buildings as he
appeared, and immediately it was as if he had
disturbed a colony of ants. Men and women
began running hither and thither in terror, and
not a few carried with them household goods of
such small value that it was a sheer waste of time
to lug them around. In a twinkling the entire
village was in a commotion, and no one appeared
to have time to spend on us who had brought
the disagreeable news.

Darius remained beyond our range of vision
perhaps ten minutes, and then he appeared with
the four Byard brothers trailing behind him,
whereupon Jerry, who had no particular love
for these lads, asked fretfully:[Pg 182]

"What do you reckon he counts on doin' with
that trash? If he needed more of a crew, it
strikes me he might have found better material."

We soon learned what purpose the old man
had in mind, for on nearing the place where our
canoe was drawn up, the Byard family went a
short distance down stream in which direction
their own craft was moored, and began making
her ready for a voyage.

"One of you lads must go to the commodore
with news of what we have seen," Darius said,
speaking quick and sharp as if to prevent us
from holding any parley on the subject. "The
Byards are to be paid for paddlin' the best they
know how from here to Nottingham, makin'
no stop on the way, an' he who goes will only
need to act as helmsman."

"Are the remainder of the party to stay
here?" I asked, not minded to take myself out
of the way when so much of excitement might
soon be witnessed.

"Sure. We who stay will be ready to make
the quickest trip on record, once we've found
out all that's to be known. Who will go to the
commodore?"

No one replied, and by this time the Byards
had their canoe afloat.

"We'll draw lots," Darius said after finding
that neither of us was willing to volunteer for
the service. "The one who pulls the shortest[Pg 183]
twig starts without delay or grumblin', an' I'm
free to tell you that those who stay behind with
me are like to have the toughest night's work
they ever put in."

While speaking he had been breaking into
bits a small twig, and five of these he held in
his clenched hand.

"Make your choice quickly, for we can't waste
many seconds over this business," the old man
cried impatiently, and we obeyed his command,
I hoping most sincerely that the lot would fall
to some other than myself, for I was willing to
risk the hard work in order to remain with the
leader.

It was Jim Freeman who drew the short twig,
and his face was pulled down very long when
he found that he had been selected.

"Into the canoe with you!" Darius cried,
"an' listen well to what I say. Tell the commodore
that we came upon the advance ships of
one fleet five miles below Benedict, and are
waitin' here to make certain what they will do.
He is to give these Byard boys three dollars for
takin' you to Nottingham. Make the best time
possible, for the fate of all our vessels in the
river may hang on you're gettin' there quickly."

The Byards dug their paddles deep in the water
as if determined to obey orders as promptly as
possible, and in twenty seconds from the time
Darius ceased speaking the canoe was around[Pg 184]
the bend of the river, Jim waving us a mournful
adieu as he disappeared from view.

"Joshua Coburn is to go with me to hide
the boat further up-stream," the old man said
with the air of a general giving his commands.
"The others may stroll around the village; but
in half an hour every one must be here on the
shore to meet me."

I gave no heed to my companions; but ran at
full speed toward home, answering curtly the
greetings from the neighbors as I passed, and
soon I was where every fellow longs to be       in
mother's arms.

She, good soul, had heard from those who
saw us, that we passed the village more than
once; but never a word of complaint because
I had not stopped to see her.

The first question was whether I had come to
Benedict under orders of the commodore, or
if I was taking time to visit her which should
be devoted to some other purpose.

I speedily soothed all such fears, and
frightened her by saying that Darius believed
the Britishers would make a halt at the village.

At first it was my belief that she should take
the children and go far into the thicket; but
she, good soul, soon convinced me that such
a course would be unwise, since it was not known
how long the enemy would remain, and she could
not stay in the forest very many hours with the
young ones.[Pg 185]

"We will wait here, Amos dear. The British
cannot be so barbarous as to make war upon the
helpless. If you or father was near at hand,
and I could go to you, the situation would be
far different."

Then she insisted that I should tell her all I
had been doing, and by the time that long story
was come to an end I had need to join Darius on
the shore, having stayed the full length of the furlough
he gave us.

It was not certain but that I could see my
mother again before we went up river, therefore
our parting was not as sorrowful as it would have
been had I known all the perils which were to
be encountered ere I looked upon her dear face
again.

The village was in even a greater state of confusion
and bustle than when I first passed
through it. A full half of the people were on
the point of running away, taking with them
as many household belongings as could be carried
or transported in carts or boats. A large number
stood on the streets undecided what course to
pursue, and asking each person they saw for
advice, while not a few were apparently bent
on following the example set by my mother.

I was appealed to for the latest news by a full
score before I could reach the rendezvous; but
to all I had the same reply, that I was in government
service and could not delay.[Pg 186]

I was the last of our party to arrive at the
shore; the other lads were standing near Darius,
looking uncommonly glum, and I could well
understand the reason for the sadness.

"Did you hide the boat?" I asked, and the
old man replied:

"Ay, a little better than half a mile up stream,
where we can come at her conveniently in a
hurry. We have just been talkin', however,
about takin' stations on the opposite bank, where
it will be possible to see what is done without
gettin' in the way of the enemy."

That seemed to me a very good idea, for there
might be many chances against our slipping
away after the British had landed, and I urged
that the change of base be made without delay.

It was if Darius had only waited for my opinion.
Immediately after I gave it he led the way
along the road which followed the course of the
river.

Within an hour we had the canoe hidden on
the opposite shore, and were seeking for some
spot directly across from the village where we
could see all that was done.

It was some time before we found exactly
what we wanted, and then it was in the midst
of a small clump of trees on a gentle rise of
the land, a full two hundred feet from the shore.

Here, by trimming away some of the branches,
we could have a full view of the river and settle[Pg 187]ment,
in addition to being at a safe distance
from the enemy, who would hardly land on that
side of the stream.

"We've got into position none too soon,"
Darius said as he pointed over the trees on the
opposite shore, where we could see the upper
spars of what appeared to be a reasonably
large vessel moving through the water slowly.
"Within ten minutes we shall know whether
it's a case of watchin' 'em come to anchor an'
landin', or takin' to our heels to gain the canoe
before they can get that far up the river."



[Pg 188]
CHAPTER XI.

THE BRITISH FORCES.

After we were in a position to see all that
might be going on immediately opposite, and for
a mile or more down the river, we could make out
the spars of several ships which appeared to be
at a stand-still, and at once the question was
raised as to whether they were aground or at
anchor.

"You lads shall stay here, never venturin'
to leave the hidin'-place unless the Britishers
themselves drive you out, an' I'll take a little
trip down stream to see what is goin' on. If
the enemy has come into the river without a
pilot, I'll go bail that more than one of his
vessels has taken the ground."

Then the old man stole softly through the
underbrush, and we gave but little heed to his
departure, so intent were we on the wondrous
panorama spread out before us.

The first craft to heave in sight was an armed
brig, the decks of which were brilliant with red
uniforms and glittering weapons, and immedi[Pg 189]ately
astern of this vessel were a dozen or more
barges, and two pungies.

Then came boats filled with soldiers, one
astern of the other until it surely seemed as if
every craft in the Chesapeake had been brought
here to make up the procession, which was more
imposing than anything I had ever seen.

It was the glittering, fanciful side of war,
which would be transformed into something
hideous immediately the actual work was begun,
for then one lost sight of the pomp and parade,
seeing only the ominous stains of blood, and unable
to hear aught save the shrieks of the dying
and the groans of the wounded.

Then, to our great surprise, we found that
the Britishers were making preparations to take
possession of the village. The armed brig was
moored stem and stern in the channel where her
full broadside could be brought to bear upon the
settlement, and the three barges, each having
on board a twelve-pounder, were rowed up to
the beach on which no less than four hundred
soldiers, with weapons ready for use, stood as
if to repel an attack.

"They are makin' a mighty lot of fuss." Jerry
said with a laugh. "A corporal's guard could
capture Benedict without turnin' a hair, an'
yet look at that crowd!"

It was truly astonishing that so many men
should have been brought to take possession of[Pg 190]
our little village. Boat-load after boat-load came
up the river, landing their living cargoes in the
cove where we lads had always kept our canoes,
and before the disembarkation had been concluded,
the shore of the river was literally
covered with soldiers, marines, and, strangely
enough, companies of negroes who were decked
out in uniforms of the British army.

Since that day I have seen statements made
by the enemy's officers to the effect that five
thousand men were landed at Benedict, and for
what purpose we lads were unable to imagine.

I had never seen such a throng of people before;
the town was over-run, and the woods
above and below seemed to be packed full of
armed men.

Fortunately for us, none attempted to come on
our side of the river; but all stood in something
approaching a military formation as if expecting
an immediate attack.

As a matter of course all us lads were greatly
alarmed lest our families should come to harm
amid such a gathering; but we could not have
afforded them any relief had we been at home,
and it was necessary to choke back our anxieties
as best we might, though it was difficult at times
to prevent the tears from coming into a fellow's
eyes.

The troops and guns had been landed before
Darius returned, and, what seemed to me strange,[Pg 191]
no other vessels of any size had put in an appearance.
There were pungies, barges and row-boats
enough to entirely choke up the river; but nothing
larger than the armed brig which had first
arrived.

When the old man came back we learned why
the fleet had apparently shrunken to such small
proportions as compared with the size of the
army.

"Nearly every vessel is aground," he said
when he approached our hiding-place with every
evidence of having traveled long and rapidly.
"The river is black with 'em from here to the
point, an' some are likely to stay quite a spell
on the mud unless mighty quick work at lighterin'
is done. I allowed the Britishers had better
sense than to run ships up here where there's
about half water enough to float 'em."

"But what is the meaning of their landing
so many men?" I asked. "There are twice
as many as would be needed to capture the whole
of Charles and Calvert counties."

"It's Washington they're aimin' at," the old
man said confidently, "though why they've
stopped here I can't figger out, unless it is that
so many of the ships are aground. Whoever
is responsible for this end of the Britishers'
movement has made a big blunder."

"Will they do any harm to the townspeople,
think you?" I asked anxiously.[Pg 192]

"It don't stand to reason they would. There
may be some plunderin' by the rank an' file;
but that's to be expected. You're thinkin' of
your mother an' the children, eh? Well, don't
worry; they won't come to harm, an' on that I'll
go bail."

"There's no tellin' how soon some of that
crowd will come over here," Jerry suggested.
"There ain't room enough on that side of the
river for all hands of 'em, an' they'll begin to
spread out pretty quick."

"That won't bother us any, for we're goin'
to pull up stakes," Darius replied quietly.

"Are we to join the fleet?" I asked.

"It's the proper thing just now, I reckon,
seein's there ain't likely to be anythin' new
around here till the enemy pushes on up the
river, which will be when he has floated some
of his vessels."

Even after making this statement Darius appeared
to be in no hurry to move on. He sat
amid the foliage watching the throngs on the
opposite side of the river until half a dozen
officers came down close to the water's edge, having
in their midst one in civilian's garb.

"There's a friend of yours," the old man said
quietly as he motioned toward the group, "an'
you can eat my head if I don't guess what's up."

My face flushed with answer as I looked in the
direction indicated, and there saw in earnest[Pg 193]
converse with the Britishers, Elias Macomber,
the traitor.

"He has joined his friends without losin' any
time. I wish I could get my fingers around his
throat for a couple of minutes!" Jerry cried,
shaking his fist in impotent rage.

"An' I reckon you'll soon have that chance,
lad," Darius said, calm and serene as a summer's
morning. "Watch out now, an' you'll get an
idee of the whole business, which will go to show
that you didn't lose anythin' much when you left
him at Hog Point. It wouldn't surprise me a
little bit if he's had a good share in sendin' the
ships aground, for he couldn't have told within
ten feet, of the water to be found in the channel."

I failed to understand very much of what the
old man referred to; but kept my eyes fixed on
the opposite shore, and saw that Elias was making
ready to embark in a canoe, which was hauled
up near at hand.

"He's goin' back to see how many vessels
are aground," Jerry suggested, and Darius added
placidly:

"You'll find that he's bound up river
spyin', an' we count on goin' in the same direction."

Now I understood! Elias was to reconnoiter
the river for his very good friends, and we could
catch him on his return, as we had done once
before.[Pg 194]

I was near to crying aloud with joy when I
realized that once he set out as Darius predicted,
nothing could save him from our clutches, therefore
I literally held my breath as he took his
seat in the canoe and pushed off.

Just for one instant my heart sank within
me, for it seemed as if he was bound down river;
but it appeared that he was simply making a
flourish to exhibit his skill with the paddle, and
then he pulled up stream, thereby doing Jerry
and me the greatest possible favor.

"Yes, he's our meat," Darius said with an odd
smile as I looked at him questioningly. "He'll
go somewhere near the fleet, to make certain
it yet remains at the place where he made his escape,
an' we won't press the villain. Give him
plenty of time to get well away from his friends."

Then the old man settled back amid the foliage
as if counting on remaining quite a while, and
I no longer thought of anything save the pleasing
fact that we would once more present to
Commodore Barney the miserable renegade.

Darius soon learned that it would not be well
to prolong his halt; we could see the soldiers
pointing toward the thicket in which we were
hidden, as if suggesting it as a pleasant camping
place when the day was so hot as to bring perspiration
to a negro's face, and a few moments
later some of the lighter boats were pushed out
from the shore.[Pg 195]

"I reckon it's time for us to make a move,"
Darius said as he arose to his feet lazily. "We
may as well be movin' toward the canoe, though
I had counted on stoppin' here till it was a bit
cooler."

According to my way of thinking we had no
more than time enough in which to get away, for
now at least an hundred soldiers were coming
across, and in case we were discovered lurking
amid the underbrush there would be such a
hue and cry that we could not hope to escape.

Darius, however, would not move one whit
more quickly because of my urging; in fact, it
seemed much as if he walked the slower to test
my nerves, and instead of parleying with him
further, Jerry and I went ahead at full speed,
having due care, of course, to caution.

It pleased me when the old man was obliged
to quicken his pace to a run, for before we were
well out of the thicket the foremost of the boats
had gained the shore.

We pressed on rapidly until coming to where
our canoe was hidden, and there we halted, not
wanting to embark until Elias had had plenty
of time in which to get well up the river, for, to
me at least, his recapture was more important
than the task of carrying information to the commanding
officer.

Lying within the shade of the trees, and so far
up river that we could neither see nor hear the[Pg 196]
swarm of soldiers which had lighted upon Benedict,
we took things easy for a couple of hours,
keeping sharp watch, however, to make certain
that no craft passed us, and then Darius gave the
word to get under way.

By this time it was night, but the young moon
and the stars in a cloudless sky, lighted up the
water-way clearly, and we had no fear that Macomber
could give us the slip, unless he returned
by land.

We paddled leisurely, for our news was not
of such a nature that an hour or two sooner or
later would make a difference so far as Commodore
Barney's plans were concerned, and had
gotten such a distance on our journey that I
began to fear the traitor had struck across the
country, when we hove him in view half a mile
or more ahead.

He was still running up the river, but I questioned
if he intended to take any chances on being
discovered, for such as he would rather
manufacture information out of his head than
encounter danger.

Darius, who had been using one of the paddles,
now took the helm, and the canoe was swung
inshore where she would be partially hidden
by the shadows of the foliage, for we did not
care to start in open chase because he would
probably take to the woods on discovering us,
and then our chances of making the capture
would be small indeed.[Pg 197]

When our quarry rounded a bend in the river,
shutting himself out from view, we bent all our
energies to the paddles, sneaking inshore immediately
we opened him up again, and thus we
rapidly lessened the distance until at the third
turn of the shore we were less than thirty yards
astern.

"Now give it to her, lads!" Darius said
sharply. "Put all your strength to the blades,
an' we'll heave him to in short order!"

As we rounded the bend, the water foaming
from the boat's bow much as it would have done
from the stem of a ship under full sail, Macomber
was but a short distance ahead, and Darius
cried:

"Push her along, lads! Now's our time!"
Then, bringing the paddle to his shoulder as
if it had been a musket, he shouted, "Drop that
oar mighty quick, Macomber, or I'll fire!"

The traitor, thus receiving the first intimation
that an enemy was near at hand, glanced
backward quickly, and, seeing the supposed
weapon leveled full at him, threw down his paddle
with an exclamation of mingled fear and anger.

We shot up alongside him like an arrow from
the bow, all hands of us reaching out to grasp
the gunwale of his canoe, and as we thus made
fast Darius grasped the fellow by the throat.

"You may as well give in quietly," the old[Pg 198]
man said, tightening his grasp until it would
have been impossible for the man to make the
lightest outcry. "If you flounder about much
all hands will go into the water, an' once there
I give my word that you won't come to the surface,
for we don't count on losin' you the second
time."

The scoundrel was as meek as any lamb, and
when Darius told me to fasten his arms together
with my belt, he held them out obediently.

I took a double turn around his elbows, and
Darius ordered him to step into our canoe,
which he did without hesitation, but once there,
seated on the flooring of the boat with his back
against the old man's knees, he glowered at us
like an angry cat.

"We reckoned you wanted to see Barney's
fleet, when you put off from Benedict, an' it
ain't jest right to make you paddle a heavy canoe
so far," Darius said grimly. "You're goin' back
with us, Master Macomber, an' this time you'll
stay."

"Not very long," the reptile said with a snarl.
"Admiral Cochrane declares that he'll destroy
Barney's fleet Friday, an' dine in Washington
Sunday. So you see I'm not likely to stay with
you any great while after the British come up
the river."

"That is as may be; now I'm countin' that
when your admiral gets as far up the river as[Pg 199]
Nottingham, if he ever does, you'll be somewhere
else, for we've taken you in charge."

"My time will come, an' then I'll pay off a
good many old scores," Macomber cried with a
look on his face which was not pleasant to see.

"If it does you any good, keep right on thinkin'
so," Darius replied mildly, "an' in the meantime
we'll keep our eyes on you. Give way,
lads, the sooner we're with the fleet now, the
better it will be."

We had no more than settled well to work
when Darius ordered us to cease paddling, as
he half rose to peer steadily ahead, and, quite
naturally, all of us glanced in the same direction.

A canoe carrying four men was coming down
stream, and while I was asking myself if we
might not have come upon more British spies,
the old man settled back with a sigh of relief.

"It's the Byard boys goin' home," he announced,
and then, as the other canoe came
within hail, he gave them information of what
was happening at Benedict.

"It don't look as if we'd better go back there,"
Sam Byard said thoughtfully when Darius had
come to an end of his news. "I reckon the
Britishers might make trouble for us, eh?"

"They'd be apt to if it was known you'd just
come from our fleet," the old man replied with
a laugh. "The best thing you can do is to turn[Pg 200]
around an' follow us. Did you get your money?"

"Oh yes, the commodore handed that over all
right."

"Where is Jim Freeman?" I asked.

"The commander allowed it wouldn't be many
hours before all hands of you came back, so he
went aboard the pungy to keep ship."

"There!" Darius said triumphantly. "You
can see how near Joshua Barney comes to the
truth when he makes a guess! I believe he could
stay at Nottingham without ever gettin' a report
from anybody, an' tell just what the enemy was
doin'."

"He'll have a chance to see what they're doin',
as soon as some of the ships can be floated!"
Macomber said with a laugh which was not
pleasant to hear.

"Which is more'n you can say for yourself if
there's any danger of the Britishers comin'," Darius
retorted. "You're our meat, Master Traitor,
an' will stay in the same keepin' till we've settled
our part of what you call old scores."

Then the word to buckle down to the paddles
once more was given, and the Byard boys
pulled their craft around to follow in our wake.

An hour later we were alongside the Scorpion
again, and this time it was not necessary to
parley with those on the guard-boat, for, on
recognizing us, they sheered off, leaving our
canoe to go where we pleased.[Pg 201]

Neither did the guard on the schooner hesitate
to arouse the commodore, and within one
minute after arriving, Darius was explaining to
the commander all that had taken place at Benedict.

"It must be they counted on coming further
up the river," the commodore said half to himself
when the story was come to an end, and
Darius took it upon himself to add:

"I allow there wouldn't have been any stop
if the fleet hadn't gone ashore; then the men were
landed to prevent you from makin' an attack."

"That seems reasonable; but they'll be here
soon enough, for it is to this place they must
come in order to strike the direct road to Washington."

Then it was that Darius bethought himself of
what Macomber had said, and he repeated the
words, adding in conclusion as he laid his hand
on the prisoner's shoulder, for as yet we had not
left the canoe:

"We've brought this cur back, sir, an' hope
he won't find it as easy to slip away a second
time. He left Benedict to spy on you, as we
saw from the other side of the river, so we gathered
him in."

The commodore looked at the man as one
would at a snake, and then said curtly:

"You'll have to keep him on board your vessel,
Darius. Our facilities for taking care of[Pg 202]
prisoners are not what they should be. Do
whatsoever you will with him, so that we can
make certain of putting our hands on him when
the matter is to be settled. You had better take
up your quarters on the pungy, and if you're
needing provisions, my cook will supply you
until rations are dealt out."

Then the commodore turned on his heel, returning
to the cabin, and we pulled around the
fleet hunting for the Avenger.

Not until after getting speech with the officer
in charge of the guard-boat did we find the craft,
and when we came alongside Jim Freeman acted
as if beside himself with joy. One would have
said that we had been separated a full year by
the way he welcomed us, and when his eyes fell
on Elias Macomber it was as if he had lost his
senses.

Well, we took the prisoner aboard the pungy,
securing him in the hold by lashing his hands
behind him, and making them fast to a ringbolt,
thus giving him a chance to sit down; but he
could neither stand nor stretch out at full length.

"It won't be none too comfortable; but it's
the best we can do now," Darius said to the
prisoner as if apologizing for not making him
more secure. "At all events, I reckon you'll
be here in the mornin', an' then we may make a
change."

The main hatch was put on and fastened down[Pg 203]
with the bar, after which we went into the cuddy,
ready for anything in the way of provisions that
Jim could set before us.

He was not overly well supplied, having been
on board only a few hours, but we contrived to
make a hearty meal, and while eating Jim heard
all we could tell him regarding the occupation
of Benedict by the British forces.

It was past midnight when we turned in, so
tired that all hands fell asleep within two minutes
after making ready, and it seemed to me that
I had not fairly closed my eyes when we were
awakened by a vigorous pounding on the side of
the vessel.

Darius had his head out of the companion-way
before it was possible for me to get on my feet,
and I heard a strange voice cry sharply:

"It is the order of the commodore that every
vessel in the fleet move up to Pig Point without
delay. Rations will be served there at noon to-morrow."

Then I heard the sound of oars as the messenger-boat
was pulled to the next craft, and
Darius said hurriedly:

"Lads, I'll admit that there are a good many
vessels in this 'ere fleet what can sail clean
around the Avenger; but let's show the commodore
that there's no crew under him who will
obey orders more smartly. Turn out lively, my
bully boys! Jim, you an' Dody get home the[Pg 204]
anchor, an' the rest of us will tail on to the halliards!"

Darius had a willing crew if there was any opportunity
to win the praise of the commander,
and he was not yet at an end of giving his orders
when we began work.

I venture to say that within sixty seconds
from the time we were hailed, the Avenger was
making way, rubbing past this craft and that
as she literally forced a passage through the
fleet, and all this before any signs of life could
be seen on the other vessels. Even the Scorpion
was yet lying idly at her moorings.

"That's what I call a good start, lads," the old
man said when we were well clear of the flotilla,
and the pungy forged ahead in good style under
the force of a fairly strong night breeze.
"We're first under sail, an' it'll go hard if we
don't come to anchor off Pig Point ahead of any
one else."

"Why do you suppose this move is being
made?" I asked, for it smacked much of running
away from the enemy, to retreat so far up stream,
and Darius had made us believe that Joshua
Barney never retreated.

"The commander has got some good plan in
his head, an' it'll come out before we're many
days older," the old man replied confidently.

"But surely we're tryin' to get away from the
enemy," Jerry suggested.[Pg 205]

"Ay, it has that look just now, I'll admit; but
you'll see some big scheme in it very soon, or I'm
a Dutchman, which I ain't."

"There's a boat dead ahead, with four men
rowin' an' one steerin'," Jim Freeman, who had
stationed himself in the tow as a lookout, came
aft to report.

"Some smarty who's tryin' to make the anchorage
first," Darius growled; "but with this wind
we can sail two miles to his one, so it won't be
that craft which will beat us in."

By this time we were well up with the boat, and
to our surprise it was Commodore Barney himself
who hailed:

"Sloop ahoy! Pass a line, and I'll come
aboard."

He got the line smartly enough, and when he
came over the rail Darius saluted, as he said:

"We counted you were aboard the Scorpion,
sir."

"That schooner won't get off for ten minutes
or more, and I allowed that the other vessels
would be handled in the same leisurely fashion, so,
I pulled ahead, thinking to be at the rendezvous
before the flotilla was well under way. You lads
obeyed orders smartly."

"It's a way they have, sir," Darius said with a
grin, as he looked over the rail to see that the
commodore's boat was being towed where she
would be the least drag on the pungy.[Pg 206]

Then it was that I tried to play the host, by asking
the commander if he would go into the cabin.

"It isn't a very nice place, sir; but it's clean,
and you may be able to get some sleep."

"I'll venture to say it's as good a sea-parlor as
I, or any other man, deserves, lad; but I'm not
needing sleep just now, therefore will stay on
deck."

Then he fell to pacing the starboard quarter,
as if he had been on his own ship at sea, and we
lads gathered well forward in order that he might
see we understood somewhat of the respect due
a commander.

CHAPTER XII.

SUSPENSE.


It is now in my mind to set down what may be
dry reading for some who chance to see this labor
of love on which I am engaged, and yet if any one
desires to know exactly why it was the Britishers
could destroy the capital of our country, and
come off very nearly scot-free, it is absolutely
necessary to become familiar with all our means
of defense at this time.

Therefore it is that I shall copy that which was
published many years later, by Mr. Lossing in his
"War of 1812," and in so doing the reader will
ask how it is that I am writing this poor apology
for a tale in the year of grace 1814, and yet putting
into it facts which were made public many
years later?

The answer to the riddle is not as puzzling as
it would seem. I am now man grown, with children
of my own. Many years ago I put together
this story, and to-day, desiring that my own boys
may read it, I am running over the leaves to add
here or there that which may make plain what[Pg 208]
I, a lad of seventeen years, overlooked at the time,
or believed to be of little importance. How
strange it is that the same thing appears entirely
different when viewed from the standpoints of a
man and a lad!

This is what Mr. Lossing says concerning the
time of which I wrote when everything was fresh
in my mind, and the sense of a wrong done this
country by England still rankling deep in my
heart:

"On the 6th of August (1814) the small British
squadron in the Chesapeake was reinforced
by a fleet of twenty-one vessels under Admiral
Sir Alexander Cochrane, the senior commander
on the American station. These were soon joined
by another under Commodore Sir Charles Malcolm.
These vessels bore several thousand land
troops commanded by General Ross, an Irish officer,
and one of Wellington's most active leaders.
Washington and Baltimore appear to have been
chosen objects of attack simultaneously. A part
of the British naval force, under Sir Peter Parker,
went up the Chesapeake toward Baltimore,
and another portion, under Captain Gordon,
went up the Potomac.

"At that time Commodore Barney, with a flotilla
of thirteen armed barges and the schooner
Scorpion, with an aggregate of about five hundred
men, was in the Patuxent river. His vessels
[Pg 209]had been chased out of the Chesapeake, and blockaded
in St. Leonard's Bay. Of this confinement
they were relieved by some artillery under Colonel
Henry Carbery, with which he drove away
the Loire, the blockading frigate, when the released
flotilla went up the Patuxent, first to
Benedict, and then to Nottingham, that it might
be within co-operating distance of both Washington
and Baltimore.

"Seeing this, the British determined to capture
or destroy it, and on the 18th of August a
force of a little more than five thousand men,
composed of regulars, marines, and negroes went
up the Patuxent, and landed at Benedict with
three cannon, under cover of an armed brig.
Most of the other large British vessels were
below, some of them aground, and all too heavy
to ascend the comparatively shallow stream.

"Barney, then at Nottingham, promptly informed
the Navy Department of the movement,
and of a boast of the British admiral that he
would destroy the American flotilla, and dine in
Washington on the following Sunday. General
Winder, by direction of the War Department,
immediately ordered General Samuel Smith's division
(the Third) of the Maryland militia into
actual service. He also called upon General John
P. Van Ness, commander of the militia of the
District of Columbia, for two brigades, to be encamped
near Alexandria; and he sent a circular
[Pg 210]letter to all the brigadiers of the Maryland militia,
asking for volunteers to the amount of one-half
their respective commands.

"By his orders, his adjutant-general, Hite, issued
a stirring appeal to the citizens to come
forward, 'without regard to sacrifices and privation,'
in defense of the national capital. Winder
also asked General Stricker, of Baltimore, to
send to Washington his volunteer regiments of
infantry and his rifle battalion.

"The veteran patriot, General Smith, promptly
responded to the call of the government. He at
once issued a division order, in which he gave
notice of the invasion, and directed the whole of
General Stansbury's brigade to be held in readiness
for active service, adding, 'the third brigade
is now under the pay of the United States, in its
service, and subject to the Articles of War.' That
corps General Smith declared to be 'the finest
set of men he ever saw.' They paraded at four
o'clock the same day, and on the following morning
General Stansbury left Baltimore for Washington
with thirteen hundred of his corps. Another
force, under Lieutenant-Colonel Joseph
Sterett, consisting of the Fifth Regiment of
Baltimore Volunteers, Major Pinkney's rifle battalion,
and the artillery companies of Captains
Myers and Magruder, left Baltimore on the evening
of the 20th, and joined Stansbury on the
evening of the 23d.
[Pg 211]
"With wise precaution, General Smith
ordered the Eleventh brigade and Colonel
Moore's cavalry to hold themselves in readiness
to march to Baltimore at a moment's warning,
for it seemed probable that the enemy would
strike at both cities simultaneously.

"The British in the meantime had moved up
the Patuxent from Benedict, the land troops being
accompanied by a flotilla of launches and
barges that kept abreast of them. The naval
forces were under the command of the notorious
marauder, Cockburn. They reached Lower Marlborough
on the 21st, when Barney's flotilla, then
in charge of Lieutenant Frazier and a sufficient
number of men to destroy it if necessary, moved
up to Pig Point, where some of the vessels
grounded in the shallow water.

"For the defense of Washington the whole
force was about seven thousand strong, of whom
nine hundred were enlisted men. The cavalry
did not exceed four hundred in number. The
little army had twenty-six pieces of cannon, of
which twenty were only six-pounders. This
force, if concentrated, would have been competent
to roll back the invasion had the commanding
officer been untrammeled by the interference
of the President and his Cabinet."

All that was written when the facts of the
case were well known, and now the story shall
be taken up as I wrote it when a boy.[Pg 212]



It was not all plain sailing from Nottingham
to Pig Point, for the water was shallow, and there
were many places where it was necessary to
handle even a pungy very tenderly in order to
avoid taking the ground.

While Darius was not well acquainted with
the stream, he had a sailorly eye for bad places,
and never made the mistake of trying to jump
the little vessel where she was likely to be held
hard and fast.

Many times were we forced to take to the canoe
in order to pull the Avenger's nose around more
sharply than could be done by the helm, and
when it came to such labor of pulling and hauling
the commodore lent a hand as if we had
been his equal in station.

And we did work lively, for a fact, hoping
to have our anchor down before any other craft
could arrive, therefore no one complained when
Darius called on us for labor which might have
been saved at the expense of three or four minutes
in time.

The commander was even more eager than were
we, to arrive at the appointed rendezvous
speedily, and we could readily guess that some
big change was to be made in the general plans,
although what it might be we came far from
guessing, since all of us, save Darius Thorpe,
believed he was simply running away from the
enemy.[Pg 213]

Well, we succeeded in doing as we wished in
regard to beating out the remainder of the fleet,
for when we came to anchor off the point and
snugged everything down Bristol fashion, there
were no signs that a single craft was following.

Commodore Barney was chafing because of the
delay, as could be seen by the way in which he
paced the deck, rubbing his hands from time to
time as he gazed down stream in vain for some
token of the laggards.

"It's only a deep water sailor who obeys
smartly, Darius," the commander said, halting
in his nervous walk to face the old man, and
Jerry and I, who were seated on the main-hatch,
pricked up our ears, for it seemed positive we
were to learn somewhat of future doings.

"These younger men know too bloomin' much,
that's what's the matter with them," Darius said
in reply. "I'll go bail that half the crowd we
left at Nottingham believed they knew better'n
you when the start should be made, an' stopped
to curl their hair before makin' sail."

Commodore Barney laughed heartily at the old
man's growling, and then said suddenly:

"I count on leaving you second in command
under Frazier, and it may be as well for you
to understand matters in case I don't get a chance
to speak with you at any length after the Lieutenant
arrives."

"You count on leavin' me, sir? Does that
mean you're goin' away right soon?"[Pg 214]

"Ay, when my force comes up. There is no
question but that the enemy is making the attack
on our flotilla to cover his designs on Washington.
He can have the fleet if he comes thus
far. I hope by daylight to be on the march for
the Wood Yard, where Winder is encamped, and
count to take with me all the men that can be
spared, for force enough will be left behind to
destroy the fleet in case the enemy appears.
Lieutenant Frazier is to be in charge of those
who remain here, and you will act as his second
in command. This is my plan: You shall have
seventy men or more, and as soon as we leave you
will make every craft ready for the torch; see to
it that there are combustibles on board in sufficient
quantity to insure a clean job when fire is
applied. After that has been done, you will wait
for the British. Once it becomes certain that
you cannot save the fleet, start your fires, and
put out for the American army, which will likely
be near Washington by that time."

"We've got some good boats with us, sir,"
Darius said thoughtfully.

"Ay, my old shell-back, and that is why I am
determined that they shall not be of service to
the enemy. You who remain behind will have
more danger to face than those who move in
advance, and because of that it is necessary you
keep the force well in hand. See to it that every
order, however trifling, is obeyed on the instant,[Pg 215]
and in event of any disposition to shirk a command,
or to loiter after the word has been given,
deal with the culprit as you would on shipboard.
Quick work is the only thing which will save you
from being killed or made prisoners."

When the commander spoke this last word
the thought came to me that I had, for the moment,
entirely forgotten Elias Macomber, and
I was puzzled to know what could be done with
him while we were destroying the fleet, if it so
chanced we were forced to such an extremity.

I spoke with Jerry about it; but he had no
suggestion to offer, save that I had better refer
the matter to Joshua Barney.

"He's forgotten all about Macomber, as we
did, an' now is the time to find out what we shall
do with him. It would hurt me mighty bad to
let the cur join his British friends simply because
we couldn't take care of him."

This last idea nerved me to do that which I
would have shrunk from at any other time, and,
approaching the commander, I asked:

"What is to be done with our prisoner, sir?
Jerry and I couldn't help hearing what you said
to Darius, and we don't want to let such as him
have a free foot after capturing him twice."

"Don't fear for that, lad," the commodore
said with a kindly smile. "Give your man breakfast
now, so that he may be in condition to march,
and when you see that we are ready to set off,[Pg 216]
bring him to me. I will see to it that he has a
care-taker who won't wink at an escape."

Then the commander fell to pacing the deck
again, and I called Jim Freeman and Dody
Wardwell into the cuddy that they might cook
breakfast for all hands, including Elias Macomber.

Jerry insisted that the cur ought to be sent
on his way with an empty stomach; but to that
I would not have agreed even though the commodore
had failed to give especial orders to the
effect that he be fed.

By the time our cooking operations were well
under way, the foremost of the fleet began to
heave in sight, and from that moment Joshua
Barney had something more to do than pace the
Avenger's deck.

We learned very soon that the Scorpion had
run aground, which fact delayed several of the
smaller boats, since Lieutenant Frazier called
upon many of the men for assistance; but all
reports ran to the effect that the fleet would
unquestionably be at the rendezvous by early
dawn.

We drew lots to see who should feed the prisoner,
and Josiah Coburn selected the unlucky
slip, which was a great relief to me, for I question
if I could have put food into the villain's
mouth with any very good grace.

We were yet at work on the breakfast when my[Pg 217]
father came aboard, the barge to which he was
drafted having been the third to arrive, and it
made me feel mighty good when he complimented
us on our smartness in handling the Avenger.

We two went well forward where we might converse
privately, and I did not think I was betraying
any confidences when I told him of the
commodore's plans. He was in nowise surprised,
and said as one would if talking to a
particular friend:

"I guessed that something of the kind might
be in the wind when the word was given to get
under way. It would have pleased me better,
Amos, if you had been detailed to go with the
advance."

"Why so, sir?" I asked, secretly rejoicing
because he was treating me as if I had been of
his own age.

"Because those who remain to destroy the
fleet will be in great danger. You cannot begin
the work until the enemy is close upon you,
otherwise it might be said that valuable property
had been sacrificed needlessly, and your risk
will be greater than mine."

"That is as it should be, sir," I replied, forgetting
that I had ever been weak-kneed or
lukewarm in the cause. "For mother's sake
you should be the one to go home, if both cannot."

"You have ever been a good boy, and a dutiful[Pg 218]
son, Amos. I shall pray that God will spare your
life, whatever He may will shall become of me."

Then my father kissed me, and I never remember
of his having done such a thing before, after
which he went over the rail hurriedly, as if not
caring to look me in the face.

It was not a particularly cheerful conversation
which we had had, and yet I was wondrously
heartened because of it. The possible danger
was very far from my mind as I dwelt upon
father's words and his good-bye. It was as
if I had suddenly come to know him in a different
fashion than ever before.

Commodore Barney used the Avenger as his
flag-ship while we were waiting for the Scorpion,
and our deck was literally crowded with men
who had been summoned to receive orders. He
even ate breakfast with us, doing the greater portion
of the eating holding converse with one or
another, and it can well be fancied that we were
proud because of having made possible such an
honor for our pungy.

The day was just breaking when the Scorpion,
attended by all the other laggards, came up the
stream. The schooner was anchored alongside
our pungy, and the commodore and Lieutenant
Frazier had a private interview in the cabin
of the larger vessel, after which word was given
for the men to disembark.

The captain of each vessel had received orders[Pg 219]
to go ashore with so many men, therefore we saw
no confusion when the final moment arrived.

Jerry and I made ready the canoe in order to
take Elias Macomber out of the vessel, and, seeing
us thus engaged, Lieutenant Frazier said
as if in surprise:

"I thought all you lads had been ordered to
remain behind?"

"So we have, sir," I replied, and then I explained
what we would do, whereupon he called
for a couple of men from the Blushing Susan to
attend the prisoner, we going with the party
to make certain he was delivered up in good
order.

Commodore Barney had not forgotten the
matter, as could be seen when he came forward
with the cur, and he handed Elias to a man
from Nottingham, with this injunction:

"You are answerable for him until we arrive
at General Winder's camp. If he attempts to
escape, shoot him without compunction; but give
him fair treatment so long as he obeys orders."

Then the commander nodded to us, as if we
were old acquaintances, and the march was
begun, every man stepping out briskly, as if it
pleased him to aid in the defense of the national
capital.

It really gave me a sensation as of homesickness,
to be thus left behind. Although sixty or
seventy men yet remained, they were so scattered[Pg 220]
among the fleet that it seemed as if we of the
Avenger were the only ones left to watch the
enemy.

"You may as well take up your quarters on
the schooner," Lieutenant Frazier said to Darius
when the detachment was lost to view in the distance.
"All of her crew are gone, therefore we
shall have plenty of room."

"I shipped with the boys, an' I reckon I'd
best stay with 'em, sir, though I thank you kindly
for the offer," Darius replied, and the Lieutenant
added quickly:

"I meant the invitation for the entire crew
of the pungy. Some of them can do the cooking
while we stay here, which won't be very
long I'm thinking."

And thus it was we made a change of quarters,
which neither pleased nor displeased me even
though the cabin was decidedly finer than our
cuddy, because I had come to have a certain
affection for the shabby pungy which cost us so
much labor in the buying.

According to Lieutenant Frazier's laying out
of the work, there was nothing for us of the
Avenger to do save care for the schooner, and
prepare the meals.

Six men were sent down the river in canoes,
to watch and report the movements of the enemy,
that we might have timely warning of their
near approach, and the remainder of the party[Pg 221]
which had been left behind were set about getting
ready for the destruction of the fleet, if
that should become necessary.

One may think that Jerry and I had no reason
to feel badly if our pungy should be burned,
since we had the guarantee from Commodore
Barney which would insure our receiving much
more money than she cost us, and yet we did
feel badly, because it then seemed to us as if
we could never get another craft quite so much
to our liking. A fellow cannot live on board a
vessel many months, sailing her in all kinds of
weather, and depending upon her for a livelihood,
without having a certain sentimental attachment
for the fabric different from that felt
for all others of its kind.

However, I had quite persuaded myself that
the British would not come so far up stream
simply in order to destroy the flotilla, for it did
not seem as if the outlay would be repaid by the
result, whichever way it might be viewed. I
had it in mind that when they learned how shallow
the river was above Nottingham, the plan
would be abandoned, therefore I felt comparatively
secure from harm as we idled away the
hours.

The fact that Darius was so uneasy should
have convinced me of the full danger, for the old
man was not one who borrowed trouble. He
fretted because he was forced to remain with[Pg 222]
the boats, instead of acting as spy, and nothing
save the fact that Joshua Barney had placed
him second in command could have kept him
at Pig Point when it seemed to him that he might
be able to accomplish much elsewhere.

When the first of those who had been sent
down stream returned, I also began to feel uneasy
in mind. The report came that the entire force
of Britishers was embarking on barges and small
boats, with half a dozen 6-pounders and as many
mortars, which showed that it was expected we
would make some resistance, and it angered me
to hear the men talking as if we were to do no
more than set the flotilla on fire when the enemy
hove in sight.

"It seems to me that we might worry them
some," I said to Darius, when he had spoken in
much the same tone as the others. "Forty or
fifty men posted along the shores would make
them a little trouble, I reckon."

"Ay, lad, an' effect about as much as so many
wasps. We might shoot down a few men; but
could not even delay the advance, an' what would
be gained? Their five thousand soldiers would
make it mighty warm for our people on the shore,
an' when it came to killin', I'm thinkin' they'd
be able to do the most execution."

Before he ceased speaking I understood how
foolish had been my words; but I was burning
with such a desire to inflict some injury upon[Pg 223]
those to whose account could be laid the destruction
of our property, that I was not really responsible
for the speech.

It was on the evening of the day when Joshua
Barney left us, that I began to be sensible of the
suspense in which one would necessarily be at
such a time. If the enemy came upon us
suddenly, it might be possible for them to capture
all hands of us, as well as carry away the
boats, and this last would be considered more
of a disaster than the first.

Twenty of our men were posted at different
points on both sides of the stream to act as sentinels,
and the remainder distributed among the
fleet in such a manner that the flames could be
started in very short order.

Neither Lieutenant Frazier nor Darius proposed
to turn in on this night. They were to
keep on the move from one sentinel to another,
in order to make certain each man was doing
his duty, and we lads were ordered to have a meal
prepared for them at midnight.

Shortly after sunset another of our people
came up the river with the report that a portion
of the enemy's force had started and it began
to seem as if a night attack had been determined
upon.

It can well be fancied that we of the Avenger
had very little desire for slumber, although, had
we been so disposed, all of us might have had a[Pg 224]
good night's rest, and also had the midnight meal
ready when it would be required.

We paced to and fro after the lieutenant and
Darius had left, speaking only in whispers, as
if it might be possible the enemy could hear us,
and each moment expecting that the alarm would
ring out.

The suspense was to me most painful, and I
said to Jerry:

"Almost anything is better than this. I wish
we were not so well aware of their coming."

"If the fleet is to be burned, an' we know the
enemy has started to come up here, I can't see
what is to be gained by waitin'," and my partner
spoke in a tone of petulance. "We shall do no
good stayin' here, and it may be that some of us
could be of service elsewhere."

"It's no use for you fellows to grumble," Jim
Freeman said with a laugh, he having come up
just in time to hear the useless words. "The
orders are to wait till the Britishers show themselves,
an' I reckon neither Lieutenant Frazier
nor Darius would like to take the responsibility
of doin' anythin' else. You two will make a
good thing out of this business, in case the Avenger
is burned, eh?"

"We've got a guarantee for more than she
cost; but at the same time I'd rather have her
than a better one," Jerry said promptly, and I
put my hand in his, for he had spoken that which
was in my heart.[Pg 225]

Then we fell to talking for at least the tenth
time of how the work of destruction would be
accomplished, and while we were thus engaged
Darius came alongside.

"You lads can turn in," he said as he clambered
over the rail. "Mitchell has just come up
the river with the news that the Britishers are
makin' camp less'n two miles below. We shan't
see 'em to-night; but they're likely to be here
mighty early in the mornin'."

"Some of us must stay up to do the cooking,"
I replied, thinking of the meal the lieutenant
had ordered.

"I'll call you in case Frazier don't change
his mind about it, but I reckon he'll be willin'
to wait for breakfast."

"Are you going to stay on board?"

"I shall be here off an' on; just now we're
goin' to inspect each craft, so's to make certain
the flames can be started quickly, for there's
no longer any chance but that the fleet must be
destroyed."



[Pg 226]
CHAPTER XIII.

BURNING THE VESSELS.


It seemed to me much like disastrous defeat
to burn the flotilla on the approach of the enemy,
without making any effort whatsoever to defend
it, and for the time I believed that Darius and
all those who bragged so much about Commodore
Barney's fighting qualities, were making idle
talk, otherwise he would have attempted to hold
his own, no matter how great the odds against
him.

At the time I failed to realize that our fleet of
small boats amounted to nothing, as compared
with either city which the British was threatening,
and that the commodore never showed himself
to be a better fighter than when he allowed
the enemy to spend their time with a lot of boats
of little value, while he was marching his men
across country to aid in the defense of Washington.

One can readily fancy that we lads were not
much inclined for sleep when Darius brought
word that we might turn in.[Pg 227]

It was definitely known that the British were
only two miles away, and would make no prolonged
halt until after striking a blow at our
fleet. In fact, it was possible they might approach
within an hour, the halt having been
called only to make us believe they would not
attempt to do any mischief during the night.

We gathered aft, but with no desire to go below,
and stood there leaning far out over the
rail with eyes and ears open for some token of
the coming foe.

It was possible to distinguish even in the gloom
a boat which was pulled from one craft to another,
stopping only a few seconds at each vessel,
and we knew the lieutenant and Darius were
making their rounds.

Again we questioned the wisdom of waiting
until the enemy was close at hand before beginning
the work of destruction, never realizing
how important it was to keep the Britishers at
the task of destroying the fleet so long as possible
that the defenders of Washington might have
opportunity to make ready; but we actually
grew impatient because the torch was not applied
at once.

Before Lieutenant Frazier brought the inspection
to a close, one of the men who had been sent
to spy out the enemy's movements, came aboard
the Scorpion to make a report. From him we
learned that the British were really encamped[Pg 228]
for the night, and there seemed little possibility
any move would be made before daylight.

Even with this assurance we lads had no desire
for slumber, and were on deck listening and
watching when Darius returned.

"Why didn't you turn in?" he asked almost
sharply, and I replied, striving to speak in such
a tone as would give him to understand that we
were not to be dictated to regarding our individual
actions while off duty.

"We prefer to remain awake. Even though
the enemy was not so near, I question if either
of us would care to go into the hot cabin, unless
orders were given to the effect that we must
do so."

"Well, I have it in mind to get forty winks
when I'm able. We may be kept on the move
pretty much all the time after leavin' here, an'
it stands a man in hand to bottle up what sleep
he can."

"I thought you counted on moving around
all night?"

"So I did before we knew that the Britishers
had settled down for a spell; but now there's
no need of more watchers than are already on
duty," the old man said as he disappeared
through the companion-way hatch, leaving me
fully sensible of the fact that I had proven myself
a prig and a fool by trying to assert my
right to do as I pleased.[Pg 229]

We could see boats moving slowly to and fro
a short distance down the river, and thus knew,
the guard having been largely increased, that if
an enemy came our way during the hours of
darkness, he must be seen by the sentinels some
time before we on the schooner could distinguish
him in the gloom.

Then Jim Freeman and his friends followed
Darius' example, by going into the cabin, and
but for what had passed between the old man and
me I would have gone with them. As it was,
I felt bound to remain, and Jerry, understanding
the situation, although he refrained from
speaking of it, stayed with me like the true friend
that he always has been.

Before midnight my eyes grew heavy with
slumber, and I said to my partner, as I led him
well forward where we could not be overheard in
case any of those in the cabin were awake:

"It would seem as if you and I were left to
look after the schooner, and surely some one
ought to be on duty, even though the spies have
reported that the enemy has encamped for the
night."

"Well, that's about what we're doin', ain't
it?" Jerry asked, and I fancied he was trying not
to laugh.

"Yes, and yet I'm getting mighty tired. I
propose that we stretch out on the deck a few
minutes, just to rest our legs."[Pg 230]

"Won't that be deserting our post?" Jerry
asked gravely.

"I don't think so, because we can hear all
that is going on, and while it is so dark there
isn't much chance of seeing anything."

"But suppose we fall asleep?"

"I'll see to it there's no chance of that," I
replied, finding it hard work to repress a yawn,
and then Jerry's mirth could be controlled no
longer.

"What are you laughing at?" I asked sharply.

"At you, Amos! You haven't made a bloomin'
success of it whenever you've tried to put on airs
over Darius; somehow he always contrives to
get the best of you. If you hadn't pulled him up
with a sharp turn, we'd be below havin' a good
snooze with the other fellows; but now we're
ashamed to go, consequently we'll camp on deck."

I was angry, and yet I knew he had spoken
only the truth. However, it seemed too late to
mend matters, and without making any reply
I laid down under the rail, fully determined to
be more of a gentleman in the future.

There had been in my mind a promise not to
close my eyes in slumber that night; but no
sooner was I at full length on the deck than I
crossed over into dreamland, and knew nothing
until the report of a cannon, seemingly near at
hand, brought me to my feet very suddenly.

"What's happening?" I cried loudly, and
from the after rail Jim Freeman replied:[Pg 231]

"The enemy are comin' into position. They
began to show up nearly half an hour ago; but
I thought there was no need to waken you till
the work was begun."

Those who had turned in, as sensible fellows
should have done, were awake and on the alert
in due season, while I who believed the safety of
the schooner devolved upon myself, slept until
the Britishers were ready to begin operations.

The day had dawned, although it was a full
half-hour before the sun would show himself.
Down the stream, within long range of our fleet,
were eight or ten barges, each carrying a cannon,
drawn across the river in such manner as to make
the flotilla a good target, and the gun which
had aroused me was evidently fired for the purpose
of testing the position.

I ran aft to where Jim and his friends stood,
asking eagerly:

"What are our people going to do?"

"The word has just been given to start the
blaze, and the lieutenant believes that we can
hold the Britishers in check until the vessels are
well afire. We're to form on the shore, and
oppose the force which you see yonder."

Gazing in the direction of Jim's outstretched
finger, I could make out a line of red-coated men
on the southerly shore some distance below the
barges, and it was not difficult to guess that they
intended to move up, once an action was begun,
to where they could fire at us from the bank.[Pg 232]

The British commander evidently believed we
would fight to prevent the fleet from being destroyed,
and, therefore, was forcing his men to
perform a great deal of unnecessary work.

Looking around at the boats and vessels of
our fleet I could see that the work of destruction
had already begun. From the hatch of the Avenger,
which craft was lying thirty or forty yards
further up stream than the Scorpion, a thin
thread of blue smoke was ascending lazily on
the clear air, and on five or six other pungies
the same ominous token of approaching ruin
could be seen.

Then it was that I saw little knots of our men
pulling for the northerly shore, and, on gaining
the bank, stave in the hulls of their canoes to
such purpose that the little craft could not again
be made serviceable.

I understood then that each squad was under
orders to land immediately the task assigned
them had been performed, and wondered if the
schooner was to be reserved until the last.

"Does the lieutenant count on saving the
Scorpion to hold the Britishers in check?" I
asked of Jim, and for reply he pointed toward
the main hatch, from out of which Darius was
just emerging.

"Have your canoe ready!" the old man cried,
addressing Dody Wardwell, who was holding
the painter of a small craft which lay under
the stern. "I allow that we'll need to leave here
in mighty quick time, for when the fire starts
it'll run from stem to stern like a flash."



As we pulled away I glanced back at our fleet and saw that the
vessels were well on fire. P. 233.


[Pg 233]
Even as Darius spoke I saw a curl of flame
from the forward hatch, and then a long, glowing
tongue leaped up toward the cordage.

While I stood watching it, fascinated by the
eager lapping of the destroying element, the
enemy opened fire from the barges, sending solid
shot amid the fleet which had already been deserted.
At almost the same moment that line of
red, which had been motionless, could be seen
flashing here and there amid the foliage, telling
that the advance of the land force had begun.

Glancing back at our fleet after making certain
that the Britishers were coming toward us,
I saw that the vessels were well on fire, although
unquestionably many of them might have been
saved had efforts been made immediately to
that end.

"In five minutes more salt won't save 'em,"
Darius said in a tone of satisfaction. "Them
bloomin' red-coats started a little too late. Come
on, lads! It looks as if we were the last to leave
the fleet, an' there isn't overly much time on
our hands. Into the canoe with you!"

We obeyed the order without delay, more
particularly since the flames were already coming
out of the Scorpion's after companion-way,
and while paddling for the shore I saw that our[Pg 234]
people were drawn up in line ready to meet
the enemy in case it became necessary to prevent
them from interfering with the work of destruction.

"Are we the only ones to go unarmed?" I
asked, noting that all of those ashore appeared
to have weapons in their hands.

"I reckon we'll find what may be needed when
we join our people," Darius replied. "The guns
an' ammunition were taken out of the vessels
last night, for powder ain't a nice thing to have
around when you're foolin' with fire."

It must be borne in mind that while we were
thus speaking the cannon on the barges were
being served with spirit, and more than one solid
shot had gone crashing through a burning vessel;
but none had come near enough to us to cause
any particular alarm.

When we were ashore I saw that there would
be no scarcity of weapons among us, and, in
fact, several of the men were forced to carry two
muskets because of the supply which had been
left behind by those who marched away under
the immediate command of Commodore Barney.

We lads succeeded in getting a good outfit,
with quite as much ammunition as could be
carried comfortably, and by the time we had
taken our places in the line, the enemy's shots
were beginning to come dangerously near some
of us.[Pg 235]

A cannon ball cut down a sapling within four
feet of where Lieutenant Frazier was standing,
and another crashed among the splintered canoes
on the bank, while from the distance came those
sounds which told of bullets striking amid the
foliage.

The soldiers were almost within effective
range, and the shot from the barges was by no
means comforting, while we could accomplish
nothing by remaining idle.

I wondered why the retreat was not begun,
if we were to make one, and felt as if I had a
personal grievance against the lieutenant because
he failed to give that order which would
permit of our getting away from such a disagreeable
situation.

"Growin' uneasy, lad?" Darius asked with a
grin, as I involuntarily ducked my head when
a solid shot passed over us.

"It strikes me that we can't do any great
amount of good by standing here," I replied
irritably.

"The lieutenant is a reg'lar little man who
believes in obeyin' orders, no matter what
happens. Joshua Barney left word that we were
not to move from here till all the vessels were
well afire, an' here I reckon we'll stay quite a
spell longer."

"But they are all burning," I said, turning
to look at the fleet, each craft of which appeared
to be enveloped in flames.[Pg 236]

"Yes, they've started well; but if I was the
one who had been left to decide when there was
no longer a chance of savin' 'em, I'd hold here a
spell longer, as the lieutenant is doin'."

"Do you believe it possible that we could save
the schooner now?" and I pointed toward the
Scorpion, along whose spars the flames were
creeping rapidly.

"Two or three hundred men might do it if
they set to work this minute, though it would be
a tough job," the old man said as he gazed at
the flames which were already sending forth
heat enough to render our position too warm
for comfort, and at that instant a musket ball
came humming past the end of his nose, causing
him to spring backward very suddenly.

"Growing uneasy, Darius?" I asked, and the
old man laughed good-naturedly as I thus passed
him some of his own coin.

"It's gettin' warm all around; but I reckon
we've come mighty nigh to the limit set by the
commander."

Then it was that the man next beside me cried
aloud as he held up his right hand from which
the blood was beginning to flow from a bullet
wound.

I was too angry to be frightened just then, for
it seemed as if Lieutenant Frazier was remaining
too long under fire, and a moment later came
the welcome command.[Pg 237]

I dare venture to say that, with the exception
of Lieutenant Frazier and Darius, every man
moved more readily and quickly than he ever
did before, until we were a good mile from the
scene of destruction, striking directly across the
country for Upper Marlboro.

Now and then it was possible to catch glimpses
of the flames, which towered above the tops of
the nearby trees; but we heard nothing of the
enemy, which seemed to me strange until I
mentioned the fact to Darius when he came up,
after loitering in the rear with the lieutenant
as if to show his contempt for the Britishers.

"I allow there's plenty of sense in their stayin'
where the fleet is burnin'," the old man said
quietly. "They saw only a few men leave when
it had been said that Joshua Barney had five
hundred with him. Now what more natural
for them to suppose that we are tryin' to lead
'em into an ambush       for the Britishers still
believe we fight in Injun fashion? Then again,
it ain't likely the foot soldiers are carryin' rations,
havin' the boats with 'em, an' it would be
poor judgment to send a lot of men into the
woods empty-handed, so to speak."

"Then you do not believe we shall be pursued?"

"If we are it'll be a fool trick," the old man
replied, and then he fell back to the rear in
response to a signal from the lieutenant.[Pg 238]

After he had thus given his opinion, which
I believe to be shared by Lieutenant Frazier,
it was in my mind that we would tramp leisurely
across the country until coming up with Commodore
Barney's force; but immediately we appeared
to be out of danger word was given to
quicken the pace.

Now it was that the officer and Darius marched
in advance, the former having given the word
that we were to keep close at his heels, and during
two hours I traveled faster than I ever did
before. It seemed as if the musket, which had
seemingly been a feather's weight when we
started, weighed more than twenty pounds at
the end of the second hour, and I was so nearly
winded that it was as if I could go no further
without first taking some rest.

Jerry was no less fatigued than I, and did not
hesitate to say he believed the lieutenant was
making us march thus fast simply to gratify
some foolish whim.

Then we were come to Upper Marlboro, after
fording the stream, and the pleasure I felt at
being allowed to sit down that I might rest my
aching feet was so great that it cannot properly
be described.

While Jerry and I were grumbling because
of what seemed to us unseemly haste, Jim Freeman,
who had been lying down a short distance
away, came over to where we were sitting, his[Pg 239]
eyes bulging as if he had seen two or three ghosts
at the very least.

"What do you suppose?" he said excitedly.

"I heard the lieutenant telling Darius that a
big force of Britishers was marchin' up from
Nottingham on the west side of the river, bound
for Washington!"

"How did he know that?" Jerry asked
sharply.

"A man who was sent back by Commodore
Barney on a scout, got here about the same time
we did, an' he reported to the lieutenant. But
that ain't all; some of the folks livin' 'round here
say that a small force       near three hundred       landed
on the west side of the river after the
enemy went into camp last night, an' is mighty
near this place now!"

"'Cordin' to that it would seem as if we come
pretty close to bein' surrounded!" Jerry exclaimed.

"That's just what Darius said," Jim replied,
"an' the lieutenant told him he'd been afraid
all along that we'd run into some such kind of
a muss. Commodore Barney warned him to be
on the watch for what appears to be happenin',
an' it begins to look as if we might have trouble
mighty quick."

"There can't be a great deal of it for the
Britishers, if their smallest force is three hundred,
for they'd make short work of us," I said[Pg 240]
with an inward quaking. "I've been blaming
the lieutenant for making us march so swiftly,
and now I wish he had pushed us on twice as
fast."

I had hardly more than ceased speaking when
the command was given to fall into line once
more, and the men obeyed eagerly, for the word
had been passed around that our small force
was in most serious danger.

Every man among us was tired, I venture
to say, yet we literally over-ran the lieutenant,
who was setting the pace, and pressed forward
like a flock of sheep pursued by dogs.

It was nearly noon when we arrived at what
is known as the Wood Yard, where General
Winder had encamped and thrown up some
slight entrenchments, and where Commodore
Barney was to have joined him; but now the
place was deserted, save for one man whom I
remembered having seen on our fleet.

As we soon came to know, he had been sent
back from Long Old Fields by the commodore
to quicken our movements, and both Jerry and
I heard that which he said to the lieutenant when
we came up.

It seems that the American troops from all
quarters were hastening to Washington, and
Commodore Barney had given orders that we
hurry forward with the least possible delay.

"The commodore told me to say that unless[Pg 241]
you kept your men moving night and day you
would be captured, for no less than three British
forces are known to be on the way here from the
Patuxent," so the messenger said, and Lieutenant
Frazier asked if he knew what body of the
enemy was coming up the Potomac.

"A portion of the British fleet under Captain
Gordon is already to be seen from High Point,"
the man replied, and then he withdrew some distance
with the lieutenant as if to give him private
instructions.

There is no need for me to set down the fact
that our small force was in a state of the greatest
excitement. From no less than three sources
we had learned that the enemy was so near as
to make capture seem certain, and our only hope
of safety was to press forward at the best possible
speed until arriving at Washington, where we
were told the commodore had already arrived.

It was a good deal like being out of the frying-pan
into the fire, for in case we contrived
to elude those who were close in the rear, we must
come face to face with a yet larger body of the
enemy when we did our feeble best toward defending
the city.

I was getting quite a big taste of warfare, and
it was by no means to my liking, although I had
by this time come to understand that I must
not put such ideas into words lest my companions
accuse me of showing the white feather.[Pg 242]

We had marched eleven miles with only one
halt of fifteen minutes, and now, instead of going
into camp as had been supposed, we were to
press forward, marching night and day, for a
distance of at least fourteen miles; but even
though it had been twice as far I would have
gone on with at least a show of cheerfulness, so
great was my fear of being taken prisoner.

We halted at the Wood Yard half an hour,
and then were going ahead once more; but at a
less rapid pace, for we could not be expected to
travel many hours at the same speed which had
been kept up since leaving the burning fleet.

We ate as we marched, munching the corn-bread
and bacon as best we might, and falling
out of line to get a drink of water whenever we
came to a brook or spring.

At the end of the first hour we were halted
for ten minutes, and then the advance was continued
until it seemed to me that I could not put
one foot before the other.

"I suppose I shall hold out as long as the rest
of you do; but it seems as if I'd got to drop down
right here," Jerry said to me as we trudged along
side by side on as fatiguing and dispiriting a
march as I have ever known since. "It's better
for a fellow to kill himself by walkin', than be
sent back to a prison on board one of the British
ships."

I tried to cheer the dear lad, although I my[Pg 243]self
was needing encouragement most woefully,
and perhaps I succeeded somewhat by saying:

"Our fathers would set us down as cowards
and drones, if the men went in with the report
that we couldn't travel twenty-five or thirty
miles without knocking under."

"You're right, Amos!" and Jerry stepped
out briskly. "We should be able to do more
of this kind of work than Darius, who has spent
all his life aboard ship, an' yet there he is, humpin'
along chipper as a sparrow."

I turned to look at the old man, who was in
the rear, marching in good order, and acting as
if on some pleasure excursion which he hoped
would not come to an end too soon. It shamed
me to see him so jolly when I was feeling so sore.

From that moment, whenever I felt as if it
was impossible to take another step, I looked at
Darius, and forced myself to forget weariness
or hunger.

It was nearly sunset when we were come to
Long Old Fields, where a portion of General
Winder's army had encamped the day previous,
and here we were met by another messenger
from the commodore.

This last man had as large a store of fresh
provisions as could be hauled by one mule, and
within five minutes after coming up with him
we were getting supper, giving no heed to anything
save the fact that we had food in plenty
for at least one meal.[Pg 244]

Later, Darius told me that the second messenger
repeated orders for us to press forward
without unnecessary delay; but when our hunger
was appeased the lieutenant gave the word that
we would be allowed to remain in camp a full
two hours, and this was no sooner made known
than the majority of us stretched our tired bodies
on the ground for a time of sleep.

Jerry and I lay side by side, and when we
were first in the proper position for sleeping I
spoke to my comrade, but he made no reply. The
dear lad had actually fallen into slumber at
the very instant his head touched the ground.

Perhaps I remained awake while one might
have counted twenty; but I am confident it was
no longer than that, and then I closed my eyes,
not to open them again until conscious of a heavy
blow on the soles of my feet.



[Pg 245]
CHAPTER XIV.

AT WASHINGTON.


The first thought in my mind, on being aroused
from deep slumber by a heavy blow on my feet,
was that the enemy had come upon us, and a
battle had been begun while I remained unconscious.

Springing up quickly, my eyes hardly half-open,
I made ready to defend myself with no
other weapons than those provided by nature,
but nothing more formidable confronted me than
Darius Thorpe, whose mouth was stretched wide
in a grin, as if he saw something exceeding comical
in thus disturbing a fellow's slumbers.

"This is no time for horse-play!" I cried indignantly.
"Having but two hours for rest,
it would seem that such jokes might be dispensed
with."

"I don't allow that I'm jokin'," the old man
replied gravely, the smile disappearing from his
face as he understood that I was thoroughly
angry. "You have used up your allowance of[Pg 246]
time in sleepin', an' now it's a case of gettin'
into line."

"I haven't had a five-minutes nap!" I cried,
firmly believing that I spoke the truth.

"It's a good two hours since we came to a
halt, but even though the time wasn't up, we'd
have to get into motion, for another messenger
has arrived from the commodore, an' there won't
be any more loafin' 'twixt here an' Washington."

"What is the news?" I asked, beginning to be
ashamed of myself because of having lost my
temper.

"General Ross, commandin' the British forces
on land, has arrived at the Wood Yard, an' the
chances are that, with troops accustomed to
long marches, he will push on without much
of a halt. Even if we were not needed in Washington,
it would stand us in hand to move mighty
quick."

Then Darius continued his task of awakening
the sleepers, and I made ready for another march
when it seemed as if the word to halt had but
just been given.

When we set out again all of us from the Avenger
were side by side, and, although it may seem
childish to say so, the fact that I had friends at
either hand gave me renewed strength of body
as well as of mind.

It is not well that I make any further attempt
at following step by step what was supposed to[Pg 247]
be a hurried movement to reinforce our comrades
of the flotilla, but which in reality was neither
more nor less than a hasty retreat. It is enough
if I say that late in the night following the day
when Commodore Barney's fleet was destroyed,
we arrived at the marine barracks in Washington,
where was the force which had accompanied
our commander.

Just then we were too tired and foot-sore to
give any heed to our friends who had been impatiently
awaiting the arrival of us who had
been left behind on a dangerous duty. We only
asked permission to lie down anywhere in order
to rest our aching limbs, and this we were able
to do, as a matter of course.

When morning came, however, and we were
awakened by the bustle and confusion which
would naturally arise when five or six hundred
men are quartered in four buildings forming a
square, we gave little heed to the stiffness of
joints and blistered feet which remained as
mementoes of that long march, as we greeted
those for whom we had greater or less affection.

The first person whom I saw was Bill Jepson.
He had been searching through the barracks
for Jerry and me, and I really believe the old
fellow was heartily pleased at seeing us once
more.

"Well, my bullies, how about that famous
ship Avenger, Amos Grout commander, and[Pg 248]
Darius Thorpe general supercargo?" Bill cried
in a voice of thunder as he shook hands with
each of us in turn, beginning with me, and ending
with Dody Wardwell.

"What there is left of her might be found at
the bottom of the Patuxent, if you hunted long
enough," I replied, feeling a bit saddened by
the loss of the pungy, and not having had time
before to think very much about her fate.

"The whole fleet went up, eh? Tell me about
it," and Bill seated himself on the edge of a
bunk as if expecting to hear a long yarn.

There wasn't much to be told, as is known by
any one who has had the patience to read what
has been set down here; but I gave him a full
account of all we had done, and wound up by
complaining of the long march we had been
forced to take.

"Don't let a little thing like that distress you,
matey, for unless the Britishers whip us out of
our boots here in Washington, I'm thinkin'
we'll have to scratch gravel a good many times
before this 'ere war is ended. Where's Darius?"

We could give him no information concerning
the old man, save to say that he was with us
when we went to sleep the night previous, whereupon
Bill said with a laugh:

"I reckon he's tellin' the commodore how this
little business should be carried on, though he
claims that the man never lived who could give
Joshua Barney points."[Pg 249]

I had no particular desire to hear about the
commodore or Darius, therefore I asked if he
knew anything concerning Elias Macomber, and
as I mentioned the name Bill burst into a hearty
laugh.

"Know anythin' about him, lad? I reckon
I do, seein's I helped lodge him in jail, an' how
the hound whined for a chance to escape! He
promised me more dollars than I could carry in
my hat, if I'd give him five minutes the start;
but so long's he didn't let on where he'd get the
coin, or how it might be passed over to me, I
couldn't make any dicker."

"Then there's no need to worry any more
about his getting away," I said to myself, whereat
Bill Jepson looked grave, and I made haste to
say:

"One might think from the look on your face
that you believed his chances for escape were
good?"

"He'll stay where he is while we hold possession
of the city, an' of that you may be certain,
lad; but in case the British              "

"You are not thinking that the enemy can
take Washington?" Jerry cried in amazement.

"Ay, lad, an' if the truth was known, I'm
not the only one who is believin' much the same
thing."

"But all the people in this country would
come here to defend the city!" I exclaimed,[Pg 250]
thinking for the moment that Bill Jepson was
trying to play upon our fears.

"They haven't done it so far," and the sailor
looked grave again. "As near as I can hear
we've got about seven thousand men near about,
an' more'n three-quarters of 'em are so green
that it would be dangerous to let the cows have
a whack at 'em."

"Have the Britishers a larger force?" Jim
Freeman asked.

"No, lad, not quite so many when you come
to number 'em up; but they are all trained
soldiers, every one the match for three of ours
in a reg'lar battle, no matter how well the Americans
can fight. Then again, what with the President
an' all the big bugs takin' a hand, we've
got too many commanders. Leave the whole
business to one man       say Joshua Barney, for
example       , an' I believe we could hold our own."

To us youngsters who had come expecting to
aid in a successful defense of the city, this kind
of talk was not particularly cheerful, and I
would have welcomed any change in the conversation;
but Bill Jepson had used his eyes
to good advantage during the short stay in Washington,
and was determined that we should receive
the benefit of what he had seen and heard.

"Last night Mr. Monroe, the secretary of
state, sent a despatch to the President, an' I
saw a copy of it while on duty at the commodore's[Pg 251]
quarters. It read like this: 'The enemy are
advanced six miles on the road to the Wood
Yard, and our troops are retiring. Our troops
were on the march to meet them, but in too small
a body to engage. General Winder proposes to
retire till he can collect them in a body. The
enemy are in full march to Washington. Have
the materials prepared to destroy the bridges.'
That was signed with Mr. Monroe's name, lads,
an' after so much, he wrote, 'You had better
remove the records.' Now do you think I'm so
far out of the way in sayin' that there's a good
chance of our gettin' the worst of it?"

Just at that moment, to my great relief of
mind, my father appeared in the doorway of the
barracks, and I sprang to meet him.

How good it was to see his dear face once
more! What a sense of relief came over me because
he was near! I was yet so young as to
believe that no harm could come to a fellow while
his father was near, and on the moment all the
fears which had been aroused by Bill Jepson
passed out of mind.

It is not necessary for me to set down that conversation
between my father and me while it
related to the dear ones at home, or our own
two selves; but when we had spoken our fill on
such matters it was but natural we should come
back to the situation in which our troops were
placed, and, greatly to my surprise, I found that[Pg 252]
my father despaired of success in much the same
measure as did Bill Jepson.

"We can only do our best, lad, and for your
mother's sake we'll pray that both of us may go
back to Benedict; but if only one, then it should
be you, who have promise of so many more years
of life than I."

We were yet speaking of matters much too
private to be set down in a story like this, when
the command came for all the men of Commodore
Barney's force to fall into line, and on the instant
we understood that we were to join the small
army led by General Winder.

I know not how it was we were so confident
as to our destination, except that the general and
our commander had been long in consultation
before this day; but certain it is we felt positive
all of us were about to retrace our steps.

And now, while our men are scurrying to and
fro making ready for another march before having
recovered from the one just ended, let me
set down here what I afterward read in print,
for it will serve to explain why we did not do
that which the country expected, and even demanded:

"Winder's situation was an unenviable one.
With a comparatively strong foe on his front,
ready to fall upon him or the capital he was
expected to defend, he had only about twenty-[Pg 253]five
hundred armed and effective men in camp,
and many of these had been from their homes
only three or four days. They were undisciplined
and untried, and surrounded and influenced by
a crowd of excited civilians, to whose officious
but well-intended information and advice the
general was compelled to listen. In addition
to this intrusion and interference of common
men, he was embarrassed by the presence and
suggestions of the President and his Cabinet
ministers, the most of them utterly ignorant
of military affairs. Better would it have been
for Winder and the country if these civilians,
from the President down, had kept away from
the camp and the field, and prudently preserved
silence."[A]

As a matter of course, we of the rank and file
knew very little concerning the trials of the officer
who was charged with the defense of the
city; but we did understand that our force was
not sufficient in either discipline or numbers to
cope with that which we must meet, yet I did not
hear a word of grumbling or fear as we made
ready for the march.

It was as if a full knowledge of the danger
served to inspire us with courage.

We set out within ten minutes after the order
had been received; but I did not see Commodore
Barney until we had retraced our steps to Long
Old Fields, and there we found the small army[Pg 254]
throwing up a slight breastwork, as if believing
that an attack was imminent.

"This looks as if you an' I might see more of
war than may be pleasant," Jerry whispered to
me as we stood in line waiting to be dismissed.
"It is all very well to fight when you're on board
a good vessel; but runnin' around on shore,
marchin' here till you can do no more than move,
an' then marchin' back again, is a little better
than I hanker after."

"It's too late to talk like that," I replied,
smiling as I remembered how eager my partner
had been to go as a soldier when I was hanging
back. "We're like to see an hundred times worse
than this before we're many hours older."

"Ay, an' there's never one here, save you,
Amos, who shall have an inklin' of the fact that
I'm growin' mighty sick of my bargain."

Then we were dismissed, to find such tents and
rations as General Winder's force could spare
us, for our baggage-train was yet on the road,
and while we were thus engaged Jim Freeman
shouted to us.

"Darius has got a tent for our crowd; it's close
by the commodore's, an', what's better, the old
sailor has been rummagin' 'round till he's got all
the grub we'll need for some time to come."

"Where are Dody and Josiah?" I asked.

"Holdin' down the tent till we can take possession;
there's so much pullin' an' haulin' after[Pg 255]
rations an' quarters, that it ain't safe to leave
anything alone."

I supposed that we would be ordered to aid in
throwing up the breastworks, therefore it stood
us in hand to learn where we belonged, before
the labor was begun, and without delay we followed
Jim.

Indeed we had been fortunate in having Darius
to care for us, since, thanks to him, none at Long
Old Fields, save the officers, were quartered as
well as we.

In a few moments the canvas tent, strewn with
our belongings, had quite a home air, and we lost
no time in making an attack on the store of provisions
which the old sailor had gathered for us.

We were eating hurriedly, lest we should be ordered
to take up the picks and shovels before our
hunger could be satisfied, when Darius came in
looking thoroughly fagged and worn out.

"But for you we'd been without a shelter to-night,"
I said as he threw himself on the ground
near me.

"An' that would have made little difference,
lad, for the open air in a summer's night is ahead
of any canvas house. Howsomever, the tent
serves as a place where we can keep our belongings
without fear some of these clodhoppin' imitations
of soldiers will get away with 'em."

"I suppose we shall be called upon to take a
hand in throwing up breastworks?" I sug[Pg 256]gested,
and a more cheerful look came over the
old man's face than I had seen since word was
given to fire the fleet.

"We who have just come in will be allowed to
take it easy, if the Britishers don't interfere, till
mornin', when, if there's time left us, we'll turn
to at throwin' dirt."

All of us lads settled back with a certain sense
of comfort and satisfaction difficult to describe.
There were many in that small army who were
hungry, because of the delay and confusion in
sending out supplies, and yet more who would lie
down with nothing to shelter them from the heavy
dew, while we were well protected, and with a
goodly food supply, all of which spoke well for
the forethought and ability of Darius Thorpe.

"I'm goin' to turn in, if so be we've got nothin'
to do till mornin'," Jim Freeman said as he suited
the action to the words, and Josiah and Dody
followed his example.

I was not minded to close my eyes in slumber
until after having heard from the old sailor all
he could tell, although it goes without saying
that I was tired enough to be able to sleep standing
up.

"Have you heard anything new since we arrived?"
I asked, and Darius replied in a low
tone, as if afraid his words might be overheard by
some one on the outside:

"The commodore says we shall have a battle[Pg 257]
within eight an' forty hours, an' you know how
well he can smell out such things. It seems certain
we can't meet the enemy here, unless more
men are sent, an', as I take it, we shall march
hither an' yon till we come to the fight fit for
nothin' but to turn in."

"Where are the British now?"

"The main body is at Upper Marlboro; but
there are a couple of columns movin' about in a
way that betokens mischief for some of us 'twixt
now an' mornin'."

"What have you been doing? I didn't see anything
of you after we started back for this place."

"I came on ahead, ridin' part of the way, with
the commodore, an' we've been on the move pretty
much ever since. General Stansbury is at Bladensburg,
an' General Winder counts on goin'
there to-morrow for a conference, leavin' our
commodore in command here."

"But what have you been doing to tire you so
thoroughly?" I persisted.

"Nothin' exceptin' tag around at Joshua Barney's
heels, an' he's a reg'lar tiger at walkin',
whereas it puts me in bad shape."

"Why not lie down while you may, and get
some sleep?" I asked.

"Because I'm under orders to go back to the
commodore. You lads turn in, an' I'll creep
under cover whenever it's possible."

Having thus evaded my question as to what he[Pg 258]
had been doing, the old man went out of the tent,
leaving Jerry and I gazing at each other, but not
daring to speak the thoughts which were in our
mind.

If Commodore Barney and Darius Thorpe
were so anxious as to what might be the result
of our meeting with the enemy, surely we two
lads, ignorant of everything pertaining to warfare,
save marching, had cause for alarm.

We sat facing each other a full ten minutes
without speaking. It was possible to hear the
laborers as they threw up the slight breastwork
which could be of but little service save to mark
our position, or the hum of conversation as the
idlers paced to and fro near the tent, and all
these sounds was token that we were a tiny part
of the living machine with which nations waged
war.

"There's no sense in sittin' here like a couple
of dummies," Jerry finally said. "We'd best be
gettin' all the sleep we can, an' then we'll be the
better prepared for what is before us."

It would have pleased me well to find my father
and have a talk with him; but I did not feel warranted
in leaving my comrades at such a time,
therefore I acted at once upon Jerry's suggestion.

It was not a difficult matter to fall asleep, after
the long march, and until late in the night I enjoyed
a most refreshing slumber, when the entrance
of Darius awakened me.

"What is the time?" I asked.[Pg 259]

"Near to midnight."

"Have you been working all this while?"

"Movin' around with the commodore, that's
all," Darius replied, as he laid down beside me,
and a moment later his heavy breathing told that
the weary old man was resting after nearly
twenty hours of labor.

Try as I might, it was impossible to close my
eyes in sleep immediately. My thoughts would
stray back to Benedict, and the more my mind
dwelt upon mother and the children the less inclined
did I feel for slumber.

I twisted and turned while my tent-mates slept
more or less noisily, until by the cries of the sentinels
I knew it was two o'clock in the morning,
and then the idea that in a few hours I must be at
work with no chance for rest, caused me to feel
drowsy.

Save for the measured tread of the sentinels,
and their calls from time to time, the silence of
the encampment was profound, and I was idly
saying to myself that it seemed difficult to fancy
one was in the midst of more than two thousand
men, when suddenly came a sharp cry from a distance,
followed by another and another until the
long roll of the drums rang out on the night air
like distant thunder.

"What is it?" I cried, as Darius sprang to his
feet.

"The call for all hands," the old man said as
he groped around for his musket and ammuni[Pg 260]tion.
"The Britishers have shown themselves,
hopin' to take us by surprise, most like. Move
lively, lads, for Joshua Barney's followin' must
be the first in line."

How we contrived to arm ourselves and get
out of the tent into the midst of a throng of apparently
bewildered men, I know not; but certain
it is we found ourselves there following Darius,
who was the only one I saw that evidently had
his wits about him. Left to ourselves we would
have wandered aimlessly around the encampment,
as did many hundred of the men; but the
old sailor, who surely should have been born a
soldier, led us to the proper place as if he had
always served his country on land instead of
water.

We found our people from the flotilla in fairly
good formation, ready to repel an attack, while
the raw militia were scurrying to and fro like
frightened sheep, and such fact made me feel
proud that I was a member of "Barney's seamen."

"You've done well, lads," the commodore said
approvingly, while he moved to and fro in front
of us to make certain that we were all there.
"We'll show these landsmen before this little
scrimmage is over, that we old shell-backs are
not web-footed when it comes to obeying orders."

Then it was that I began to understand why
those who served under Joshua Barney were so
proud of, and had such confidence in, him. There[Pg 261]
was in the ring of his voice, in his way of looking
at a fellow, and his every movement, something
which bespoke him a friend, and from that
moment, I became as ardent an admirer of the
fighting captain as ever was Darius Thorpe.

Of a verity I believe a full fifteen minutes
elapsed before all our people were in line of
battle, which spoke badly for what might happen
in case the enemy planned a surprise, and then
we learned that the alarm was a false one.

"Some weak-kneed sentinel was frightened at
his own shadow," the commodore said, speaking
quietly to his men. "But it hasn't done us any
harm to be routed out in short order, for now
we can see how necessary it may be to know our
stations. Turn in, my hearties, and get what
rest you can before we stand up in front of the
red-coats to give them a lesson which they're
needing."

Then we went back to our tent; but not to
sleep. There is a mighty lot of excitement in turning
out at night to be shot at, and Darius was
the only member of our party who felt inclined
to lie down.

We sat under the canvas talking in whispers,
lest we disturb those near at hand, and the old
sailor was soon giving good proof that he had
sailed over into dreamland.

Of what did we talk? I can't really tell; but
you might put yourself in our places, and say
if you would not naturally speak of those most[Pg 262]
dear when you knew beyond a peradventure that
within a few hours at the most you would be
standing face to face with death.

When the day broke we stole softly out of the
tent that Darius might get all the sleep possible,
and, building a small fire, toasted the strips of
bacon which made up the greater portion of our
rations.

Then all hands sat around the tent to prevent
any one from awakening the old man without
good and sufficient cause, until sunrise, when
word was passed from one to another that orders
had been given to load all tents on the baggage-wagons,
for the army was to move within an
hour.

Then it was that we felt obliged to call Darius,
and he came up on his feet at the first word,
having all his wits about him at the moment
of awakening, as is the habit of sailormen.

"Goin' to move, eh?" he said, when we told
him of the order. "Then I'm thinkin' the next
halt will be at whatsoever place General Winder
has picked out for a battle-field. Look after the
tent, lads, while I get a word with the commodore."

He marched off in the direction of headquarters,
and we set about the task, I observing
while passing among the militia, that the men
as a rule were looking mighty glum, which
augured ill for their performances if indeed a
battle was near at hand.

CHAPTER XV.

BLADENSBURG.


If I would tell all that was done in and around
Washington by our people, and then have space
in which to set down that which we lads were
able to accomplish after the British had worked
their will, very much of what then seemed highly
interesting to us of the Avenger, must be passed
over with but few words.

Perhaps it is well that it should be so, for we
moved here and there without apparent aim or
purpose until every man and officer was on the
verge of exhaustion, and then, when it required
no slight effort simply to remain on our feet,
we were forced to meet the British army, which
had advanced by short stages to the end that
the men should be in the best physical condition
for that struggle which decided the fate of the
nation's capital.

We had no sooner struck our tents than word
was brought that the President was on his way
from the Potomac to review our troops, and at
such information Darius grumbled loud and long,[Pg 264]
therefore we lads knew full well that Commodore
Barney was opposed to such monkey-shines,
otherwise the old sailor would not have dared
to voice his complaints so stoutly.

When we might have been resting preparatory
to the extraordinary fatigues that were before
us, all our little army were forced to remain in
line a good two hours, when President Madison
was ready to begin the review, after which we
marched and countermarched in front of him
when three men out of every four were unable to
understand the words of command.

It was a most ridiculous performance, as can
well be fancied, and if the chief magistrate of
the land was well pleased with the result, it is
more than can be said for the officers in command.

By the time this mockery of a review had come
to an end, scouts arrived with information that
the main body of the enemy was still resting
comfortably at Upper Marlboro, whereupon we
were allowed to remain in line while the general
sent couriers to the different commanders under
him, directing them to move in the direction of
the British camp.

We remained on parade from shortly after sunrise
until ten o'clock in the forenoon, when we
were as tired as if from a long march. Then
we were dismissed; but since all the tents had
been carried away in the baggage-wagons, there[Pg 265]
was nothing for us to do save lounge around in
the open field exposed to the burning rays of
the sun.

Nothing more was done in the way of throwing
up breastworks, therefore we who had been the
last to leave the fleet, were not called upon to
handle pick or shovel.

An hour before noon General Winder, escorted
by a troop of Laval's cavalry, left the encampment,
and it was reported that he had gone to
hold a conference with General Stansbury at
Bladensburg.

All our rations, save what each man had held
back in his pockets, were with the baggage-train,
therefore we did not make a very hearty meal at
noon, and perhaps it was as well, for while we
were eating the small amount of food at our disposal
two companies of Maryland militia, under
command of Major Peter, came into camp on the
double quick, with every evidence of terror on
their faces.

Immediately the long roll was sounded, and
as we fell into line once more, expecting to see
the enemy advancing, word was whispered
around that Major Peter, scouting in the direction
of Marlboro on the Wood Yard road, had
skirmished with the Britishers, and been driven
back.

Commodore Barney and General Smith, who
had command of the militia in the absence of[Pg 266]
General Winder, set about making preparations
for battle, and Major McKenney was sent in hot
haste to inform our commander of the position
of affairs.

We remained under arms, and in momentary
expectation of being engaged in a life or death
struggle, until near sunset, when General Winder
arrived, and without loss of time we were headed
for Washington at a sharp pace, thus being
forced to march over the same ground three
times without having seen the enemy once.

We arrived for the second time at the capital
about midnight, and were posted near the
Eastern Branch bridge, there to get such repose
as might be possible while we did guard duty
on that side of the city.

In order to show that my grumbling had good
foundation, I am going to set down here a portion
of General Smith's report, as I heard it read a
week later:

"The arrival at the Eastern Branch bridge
terminated the four days of service of the troops
of this District. They have been under arms,
with but little intermission, the whole of the
time, both night and day; have traveled, during
their different marches in advance and retreat,
a considerable tract of country, exposed to the
burning heat of a sultry sun by day, and many
of them to the cold dews of the night, uncovered.
They have in this period drawn but two rations,[Pg 267]
the requisition therefor in the first instance being
but partially complied with, and it being
afterward almost impossible to procure the
means of transportation, the wagons employed
by our quartermaster for that purpose being constantly
impressed by the government agents for
the purpose of removing the public records when
the enemy's approach was known, and some of
them thus seized while proceeding to take in
provisions for the army."

On that night after our arrival we heard that
the British were advanced within two miles of
Long Old Fields. We who comprised the command
under General Winder were worn and
dispirited; Laval's horsemen were exhausted, and
Stansbury's men at Bladensburg were tired out
by long marches, lack of sleep and scarcity of
food.

As if to make bad matters worse, our general
fell from his horse near about daybreak, and
really was not fit to remain in the saddle, although
he pluckily kept on duty, not the least of
which were many conferences with the President
and members of his Cabinet.

At sunrise, after our force had indulged in
less than two hours' sleep, Laval's scouts brought
in positive information that the British General
Ross was marching directly toward Bladensburg;
half an hour later messengers came from
General Stansbury with the word that the enemy[Pg 268]
was in his front, and urging that reinforcements
be sent at once.

It was a case of making another march without
breakfast, and, for the matter of that, we
had had no supper the night previous.

There was more than one grumbler when we
obeyed the summons to "fall in;" but the men
under Commodore Barney held their peace after
our leader urged that we act "like patriots, and
not like children who had come out expecting
to enjoy a holiday."

Well, off we posted for Bladensburg, a good
eight miles from where we had halted, and I for
one hoped that the battle, since there must be
one, would be on at once, for it seemed better
to be shot at than worn down by apparently
aimless running to and fro.

We of the flotilla arrived near Bladensburg
shortly after noon, and were stationed about a
mile from the village on the Washington road.
There we found two eighteens and three 12-pounders,
all ship's guns, mounted on carriages,
which had been drawn to the spot by the marines
from the navy yard, and with these we were supposed
to hold our position, having no other support
than a crowd of raw militia in front of us.

Our force, meaning those under Commodore
Barney's command, numbered, as I have already
said, about five hundred, and although we had
no knowledge of military tactics, we knew enough[Pg 269]
to obey our officers to the best of our ability,
which was considerably more than could be said
for very many of the troops near at hand.

I cannot set down that which followed, in
proper fashion so that it could be understood
by those familiar with the game of war; I only
know what happened near my comrades and
myself, for the crew of the Avenger had taken
good care to stand side by side at this time when
one or all of us might meet death through the
medium of British lead.

For myself, I can say this: that when I looked
around at the mass of men       five thousand strong
I have since heard       , and saw them wrangling
over this trifling matter or that, openly disputing
some command, or boldly leaving an assigned
position to take up one which pleased them
better, I had more fear of what might come to
us through the cowardice or ignorance of our
own people, than regarding the ability of the
enemy to cut us up.

Darius made his preparations for the conflict
by stuffing a huge piece of tobacco into his mouth,
after which he proceeded to read us a lecture
on behavior while under fire.

"Remember this," he said with the air of one
who knows it all, "it isn't every bullet that finds
its billet, an' the toughest time is just now, when
we're waitin' for what all hands know is bound
to come. Think of the folks at Benedict, an'[Pg 270]
kind'er figger out what they'd say if you went
home after showin' yourselves cowards under
fire. There are worse things than bein' killed
or wounded in battle, an' the hardest is to live
knowin' every youngster on the street has the
right to call you a white-livered sneak what ran
away when danger came. Stand here behind
Joshua Barney, for I warrant he won't give you
a chance to get in front of him, an' you'll be doin'
about right."

When the old man had come to an end of his
instructions, we would have conversed among
ourselves, speaking much, no doubt, of the folks
at home; but he sternly bade us hold our tongues,
thinking that we would not be heartened by such
talk, and straightway began to tell us a yarn of
how he and Bill Jepson had fought under Commodore
Barney, when the enemy was a ship of
thirty-two guns, and they in a schooner carrying
only twelve 10-pounders.

The yarn had not yet come to an end when a
commotion among the men in front of us caused
me to crane my neck to look in the direction
many were pointing, and there I saw the lines
of red marching directly toward us in perfect
order, as if on parade.

At almost the same moment the enemy began
to throw rockets among our people, and these,
exploding, hurled bullets' in every direction.

Within two minutes from the time I first saw[Pg 271]
the Britishers, no less than five men near me
were stricken down, and the sight of the gaping
wounds, together with the moans of the sufferers,
gave me a sensation of faintness which was well-nigh
overpowering.

"Stand steady you lads from the Avenger!"
Darius cried sharply, warned, no doubt, by the
sight of our pale faces that we were growing
sick in more ways than one. "Somebody must
get hurt, else the battle would never be over, an'
we're here to spoil the Britishers' fun, which we
shall do mighty soon. Joshua Barney is only
waitin' for the proper time, an' when he gives
the word to begin work, there'll be a change of
tune."

At that moment, and before a gun had been
fired, the militiamen in front of us broke into a
run toward the rear, many of them throwing
down their muskets as they took part in a most
disgraceful retreat.

For the credit of our flotillamen, and the
marines, I must set it down that not one of them
wavered when the retreat was begun, and after
the last of the cowards was in the rear I heard
the commodore shout:

"Now's your time, lads! Give it to 'em hot
an' strong, but make every charge count!"

Then our ship's guns were discharged, and the
faintness left me as I saw the missiles cut down
long lanes in the red-coated ranks; the smell of[Pg 272]
burning powder must have got into my brain,
for from that moment I knew nothing save that
my musket was to be loaded and discharged
as rapidly as possible.

Men fell around me by the score, yet I gave
no heed to the evidences of suffering. Once, a
man shot through the head, pitched forward
directly into my arms, covering me with blood as
he sank dead at my feet, and yet, unused though
I was to such scenes, it caused me no other feeling
than that of anger because he had spoiled
my aim.

I knew nothing of what was going on immediately
in front of me, save that the red line, now
broken by many a gap, was before my eyes; that
it advanced, fell back and advanced again, sending
among us such a shower of bullets that the
buzzing in the air was like unto a swarm of
angry bees.

Once Jerry tried to say something to me, but
I pushed him back petulantly, so strong a hold
had the fever of battle upon me. My musket
barrel grew hot to the touch, and it was no longer
possible to charge it properly. Without compunctions
I exchanged weapons with one of the
dead men at my feet, and continued the work,
shouting aloud in vengeful joy when I saw an
enemy fall by my hand.

Darius cried out in my ear; but I heard him
not, nor did I heed the fact that he wanted to[Pg 273]
speak with me. I was insane with the scene of
carnage, the salty odor of blood, and the choking,
stifling fumes of burning powder.

Then, suddenly, Darius pulled me back by
the coat-collar, forcing me to run with him, and
as we went swiftly past our guns toward the rear,
I asked what he was doing.

"The word had been given to retreat!" he
cried. "Do the best you can with your legs, lad,
for there'll be no quarter given if we are taken.
We of the flotilla, with the marines, have borne
the brunt of this whole battle for the last half
hour, an' we've left our mark on the red-coats,
even if we are turnin' tail now!"

"But the commodore?" I cried, now getting
back a portion of my scattered senses.

"Wounded ten minutes ago, an' taken off the
field, I hope. It was in my mind to help him; but
he ordered me to go back to duty, an' I went, for
when Joshua Barney gives the word, even though
he's half dead, it's safest to obey without makin'
much talk. Captain Miller of the marines was
shot down at about the same time."

Then I had sense enough to see that all my comrades
of the Avenger were close about me, none
of them appearing to be hurt, and while we ran
to save ourselves from being made prisoners,
let me set down that which was written less than
a week after the battle of Bladensburg, for, as
it turned out, we had fought a regular battle.[Pg 274]

"No troops remained in line, except the party
under Commodore Barney, and two detachments
on his right, that were well posted. Having
been so roughly handled, the enemy made no
attempt to advance directly in front of the seamen
and marines, but, after forcing the troops
on their right from the field, by a demonstration
in that direction, they prepared to turn the
rear of Barney in order to surround him.

"While these movements were going on in
front, a party of light troops had been thrown
out on the enemy's right, and the militia having
abandoned the ground, they were also beginning
to close upon the Americans that stood. By this
time Commodore Barney, Captain Miller, and
several other officers were wounded, and, victory
being impossible against odds so great, an order
was given to commence a retreat.

"The defense had been too obstinate to admit
of carrying off the guns, which were necessarily
abandoned. All the men retired, with the exception
of the badly wounded; among the latter,
however, were Commodore Barney and Captain
Miller, who both fell into the enemy's hands.

"Of the marines, nearly one-third were among
the casualties, and the flotilla-men suffered considerably,
though in smaller proportions. The
people of the flotilla, under the orders of Barney,
and the marines, were justly applauded for their
excellent conduct. No troops could have stood[Pg 275]
better, and the fire of both artillery and musketry
has been described as to the last degree severe."

Jerry, who reads each day what I write, says
that by putting down the account of what we
of the flotilla did, I am blowing my own horn;
but I do not so consider it, since the fact is a
matter of history, and if we won praise on that
disastrous day, then we should boast of it to
the end that the picture may not be so black.

And now to return to us of the Avenger who
were fugitives, without any idea of where safety
might be found.

Strange to say, not one of us had been
wounded, while many a better man close beside
us had met his death.

Darius took it upon himself to lead our party,
and right willing were we to have him act as
commander, though I question if he really knew
where he was going when we left the bloody
field.

There is no shame in my heart when I set it
down that we ran from the enemy, and did our
level best at that game; the order to retreat had
been given after we had done all that might have
been expected from well seasoned troops, and
to have remained longer would have been a useless
sacrifice.

By instinct, rather than deliberation, Darius
led us southward, close on the heels of several
hundred men, all of whom were quite as eager
as we to keep out of the enemy's clutches.[Pg 276]

To the best of my knowledge the British did
not pursue; they had won a victory, but in so
doing received quite as much of a drubbing as
was needed, and officers as well as privates
were willing to remain on the hard-earned field.

I believe it was a full hour before Darius would
allow us to slacken the pace, and then we were
well among the foremost of the fugitives.

By this time we were so nearly winded that it
was impossible to continue the flight without
a breathing spell, and the old man allowed us
to halt when we were close upon the city.

We could see that our people were bearing
to the west, in order to give Washington a wide
berth, and, when it was possible to speak because
of my heavy breathing, I asked Darius where he
proposed to go.

"That's what I haven't rightly made up my
mind on," the old man said thoughtfully. "It
stands to reason that the enemy will, sooner or
later, try to make as many prisoners as possible,
an' I'm allowin' that those fellows ahead are
bound to have a hot time of it before they're
many hours older. If we could only get down
the river!"

"But we can't, an' that much is certain," Jerry
said petulantly.

"Perhaps you've got another scheme in your
head, since the oyster business turned out so
well," and it is possible that I spoke sharply,[Pg 277]
realizing with bitterness just then that but for
my partner's proposition to sell fish to the fleet
I might never have discovered I owed my country
a duty, and, consequently, would not at that
moment be hunted down, or in danger of it.

"Perhaps I have," Jerry replied quietly, giving
no heed to my disagreeable manner of speaking.

"What is it, lad?" Darius asked curiously.
"I take it that at such a time as this a bit of
advice, no matter from whom it comes, is well
worth listenin' to."

"Why not go straight into Washington, an'
stay there till we find a chance to slip down the
river?"

"Into Washington?" Jim Freeman cried in
alarm. "Why the Britishers have promised to
burn the town!"

"I know that, an' it ain't likely any of our
people will go there because of that same thing."

"An' yet you allow that we should stick our
noses into the mess?" Darius asked.

"Ay, because the Britishers never will suspect
that any who took part in the fight would go
there. It should be possible to find a hiding-place
somewhere in the town, an' it strikes me we
wouldn't be in as much danger as if we kept with
the crowd."

I began to think that there was more in Jerry's
scheme than appeared when he first suggested[Pg 278]
it, and Darius seemed to be considering the
matter very seriously.

"In the first place," my partner continued,
warming to the subject when he saw that we were
interested, "it would be necessary to get there before
the Britishers took possession, an' it might
be we could pass ourselves off as fellows who had
stayed in the town like cowards, rather than
take the chances of bein' shot."

"It's a pretty good scheme, lad, an' I for one
am willin' to try it," Darius said abruptly as
he rose to his feet. "If the others think as I
do, we'd better be movin'."

After the old man had thus spoken there was
not one of us who would have ventured to object,
for he had shown that in any business of this
kind he knew more than all of us put together,
therefore we made ready to set out; but before
the first step had been taken we saw coming toward
us from the direction of Bladensburg, a
man riding a mule, and waving his arms as if
to attract our attention.

"Go on," I said petulantly. "We can't afford
to hang around here very long if we count on
finding a hiding-place in the city, and that is
only one of the country people who wants to
sell his mule."

"I reckon we'll wait a bit," Darius replied
firmly. "Unless I'm way out of my reckonin',
yonder man was in the fight, an' has scooped up[Pg 279]
one of the baggage-wagon mules to help him
along."

"But our party is too big for safety now, and
what will it be if we allow every straggler to
trail on behind? We might as well follow the
other fugitives."

All this I said like a peevish child, and no
sooner had I ceased speaking than Darius seized
me by the shoulder, forcing me to turn until I
had a full view of the newcomer.

"Look at the man," the sailor cried sternly,
"an' then say whether you will allow every
straggler to trail on behind us when the road
is as free to one as another?"

In an instant I was covered with confusion
and remorse. The man to whose company I had
objected was none other than my own father, and
as he approached I could see that he was
wounded in the right leg.

There was nothing I could say just then to
show my comrades how deeply I regretted having
spoken in such a tone, therefore I ran forward
to greet him who, a moment previous, I
had been eager to leave behind.

My comrades joined me as I saluted my father
much more warmly than I might have done but
for the unkind words I had spoken, and in a
few seconds we heard all the story he could tell.

He had been wounded quite severely during
the early part of the battle, and went to the rear[Pg 280]
in search of the surgeons. Failing to find those
whose duty it was to be near the scene of action,
and unable to walk any further owing to loss
of blood, he laid down under one of the baggage-wagons
which had been used to transport ammunition.

Here he bandaged his wound as well as
possible, and was about to set out once more in
search of aid, when the final retreat was ordered.
Unable to walk, he would soon have been made
a prisoner, or, perhaps, in the heat of the moment,
received worse treatment, when the idea of
escaping on one of the mules occurred to him.

Cutting the traces he rode off, taking a course
to the north in his ignorance of the country;
but, discovering his mistake, he turned about,
and the first persons he saw were those of our
party.

Without wasting any time we told him of
Jerry's scheme, and he, having nothing better
to propose, agreed to make the venture, more
particularly because he stood sadly in need of
some attention, since the wound had been only
rudely bandaged.

Darius claimed that he could treat it after a
sailorly fashion, provided we found clean water
and cotton cloth, and declared that it would heal
as well after such treatment as if any save a
skilled surgeon had dressed it.

As a matter of course we kept the mule, for[Pg 281]
it was necessary my father should ride, and after
the delay needed in which to explain matters,
our little party started toward Washington,
knowing full well that we were going where it
was certain the enemy would soon come.

Although I had agreed to Jerry's scheme, and
was willing to do whatsoever the majority of my
companions decided was for the best, I could not
but believe that ours was as rash a move as
fugitives ever made, for of a verity it was thrusting
ourselves into the jaws of the lion.

Now that my father was with us, having his
wound as proof that he had taken part in the
battle, we could no longer hope to pass ourselves
off as cowards who remained at home while
others were fighting for us, and in event of being
captured in the city I believed we would receive
rougher usage than those taken prisoners on the
battle-field.



[Pg 282]
CHAPTER XVI.

IN HIDING.


I question if my companions were any less
uneasy in mind regarding our seeking a refuge
in the city about to be occupied by the British,
than was I; but no one ventured to say exactly
what he thought lest it serve to check our courage,
and of a verity we needed that in abundance
if we were to make a success of Jerry's scheme.

Darius and I walked either side of the mule
on which my father rode, where we might be
ready to give the wounded man assistance in
case his strength failed him suddenly; but neither
of us dared discuss the possibilities of the future.

When we were come nearly to the city my
father asked me if we had any money with which
to purchase food, and I replied by showing him
the two silver coins remaining of the amount
paid by the Britishers for oysters.

Darius had the same number of pieces in copper,
and Jim Freeman was the capitalist among
us, he having no less than two shillings.

We had funds in plenty for the purchase of[Pg 283]
such food as would satisfy our hunger during two
or three days, and the only matter which gave us
any uneasiness was regarding a shelter, which
had now become absolutely necessary since father
joined us, for it went without saying that he
must not be seen.

When Jerry conceived the scheme we were
attempting to carry into execution, he believed,
as did I, that Washington would be almost wholly
abandoned by the citizens, and, in fact, it was
reasonable to suppose that when the news of the
defeat was brought to the city nearly every one
would seek safety in flight, therefore we counted
on being able to take shelter in any building
which took our fancy.

While yet in the outskirts of the town, however,
we understood that we were mistaken. So
far as I could see, the inhabitants remained
within their homes, probably under the belief
that the enemy would behave like civilized people
rather than as barbarians, and our chances for
finding a hiding-place seemed small.

Having no acquaintance with the city, we
walked on at haphazard until having come within
a short distance of a tavern near the Capitol,
hard by a large building which looked not unlike
a rope walk.

It was in my mind that we could do no better
than stop at the tavern, trusting that our small
store of money would suffice to pay for one room[Pg 284]
in which all of us might gather; but to this
Darius made most decided objection.

"It is the last place for us to choose," he said
decidedly. "Even if the house is not taken as
quarters by some of the officers, it will be visited
by the rank and file, and we might as well be in
the open air. Yonder smoke-house would suit
our purpose better."

It seemed to me that in a city said to contain
nine hundred buildings we could do better than
hide in a smoke-house, and so I said, claiming
that we would be in no more danger by making
ourselves as comfortable as possible under the
circumstances, than if we huddled into some
corner.

Jim Freeman and Jerry seemed to be in my
way of thinking; but Darius declared that unless
we could content ourselves with such a
hiding-place as was not likely to attract the attention
of the enemy, we might count him out of
the scheme.

"But what can be done with the mule, if we
take to the smoke-house?" I cried, believing I
thus had an argument which he could not well
answer.

"Turn him loose, of course. He is government
property, and would give stronger proof
of our havin' been with the army than your
father's wound. Besides, should the soldiers
hear him, an' you can't reckon on keepin' that[Pg 285]
kind of a beast quiet, they'd be bound to have him
out, if only for the sake of sport."

Then Darius went toward his chosen place of
refuge, leaving us to follow or not as best pleased
us, and the result can well be imagined.

We would not cut loose from the old sailor
who, because of his experience in such circumstances,
was best calculated to advise and aid,
therefore we followed him meekly, but with
many a mental complaint.

When we were come to the rough building,
which was hardly larger than the cabin of the
Scorpion, Darius lifted my father from the
animal's back as if he had been no more than
a child, and carried him into the place that was
less inviting than the hold of the Avenger after
we had taken out a cargo of oysters.

Placing him in one corner where he might
sit with his back against the boards, the old
sailor went outside and drove the mule in the
direction of the tavern, himself following until
he was lost to view, much to our surprise and
disquietude.

"Now what is he about?" Jerry asked petulantly.
"I thought we were to stay here?"

"It seems that we are," I replied with a mirthless
laugh; "but it appears that Master Thorpe
counts on being better lodged."

"Do you suppose he allows to stop at the
tavern while we're to stay in this smoke-house?"[Pg 286]
Jim Freeman asked in a tone of dismay, and I,
sore at heart because my advice had not been
followed, replied bitterly, thereby setting myself
down for at least the twentieth time as a
simple:

"We can be certain he'll look after himself,
no matter how we may fare."

Then we stood waiting in silence until it should
be certain that Darius had really abandoned us,
when my father said, striving to suppress any
evidence of the pain which he suffered:

"You lads are making a big mistake if you
think Darius Thorpe would leave you at such a
time as this. He has ever had the name of holding
to a comrade, and he'll not steer another
course while we're in so much danger."

Five minutes later I was covered with shame
because of my unkind words, when we saw the
old man returning with as much hay as he could
stagger under.

"Here's what will make our cripple a bit
more comfortable," he said cheerily as he thrust
his burden through the narrow door. "Pile it
well up under him, an' I'll go back for the rest
of the supplies."

None of us lads made any comment when
Darius returned toward the tavern; but that all
hands were conscious of the same sense of shame
as had come over me, I understood by the expression
on their faces.[Pg 287]

When the old man joined us the second time
he had in his arms the larger part of a ham, some
strips of cotton cloth, and a jug of water.

"How did you get all that stuff?" Jerry asked
in surprise.

"Traded the mule. When I was drivin' the
beast off it struck me that he might be made to
serve us a bit, so I drove a bargain."

"Did you give the people to understand that
he was yours?"

"Not a bit of it, lad; I ain't tryin' that kind
of business even when I'm hungry. I told the
truth; but claimed that the beast was under my
protection, an' I'd be willin' to leave him for the
few things we might need. It ain't certain but
I'd got what I asked for without the mule, though
it was better to have a reg'lar trade made. Pitch
into the ham, and later, it may be we can get some
bread."

We did not wait for the second invitation; but
began chipping off bits of the meat, eating
greedily regardless of the fact that it was uncooked,
when I saw that Darius was making
no effort toward getting his share.

"Why don't you eat?" I asked as I gave my
father a small handful of the uninviting food.

"I'm the surgeon now, an' till this job is
finished I reckon I can contrive to get along without
more in my mouth than a piece of terbacco.
It's mighty lucky I laid in a good supply before
we left Pig Point."[Pg 288]

The true-hearted old sailor had provided us
lads with a meal, and now proposed to dress
my father's wound before attending to his own
wants, which must have been greater than ours
because he had performed more work.

I resolved then and there, that however much
against him might be appearances, I would never
believe him guilty of any mean act toward his
comrades, and in the future he should have the
full half of anything which might come into my
possession.

Darius washed and bandaged father's wound;
raised the bed of hay that he might recline more
comfortably; fastened the door in such a manner
that there would be no token on the outside
of our occupancy, and not until all this had been
done did he give heed to his own necessities.

"We're not so bad off here as we might be,"
the old man said in a tone of content as he
whittled away at the small remnant of ham, while
we lads were stretched at full length on the
hay. "I'm allowin' that whatever happens, the
Britishers won't look in a smoke-house for
American soldiers or sailors, an' we can stay here
snug as bugs in a rug, barrin' bein a little hungry,
till Amos' father is in better condition to travel."

"But it will be a long while before that wound
is healed!" Jim Freeman exclaimed in dismay.

"Yes, I reckon it'll be quite a spell, pervidin'
the Britishers stay in the city; but if they go
it won't be a hard job to find a boat that'll take[Pg 289]
us to the Patuxent. But there's little call to
make much talk about movin', for we can't leave
one of the crowd, no matter what happens to the
rest of us."

By the time all this had been done it was sunset.
The retreat from Bladensburg had been
begun about four o'clock in the afternoon, and
we were not so badly off to be in Washington
and housed so soon after the defeat.

The one distressing question was whether the
enemy would make search in the city for such
as we?

After he had eaten all the scraps of ham remaining
on the bone, Darius set about making
a more thorough examination of our refuge, beginning
with the small shutter at the top of the
building which was used when, the meat having
been cured, it was desired to clear the place of
smoke.

"What are you doing up there?" my father
asked when the old sailor clambered on the logs
to get at the shutter.

"Makin' sure we can keep a lookout in case
things get too hot," Darius replied with a laugh.
"I'm allowin' this shutter can be swung open
a crack without its bein' noticed from the outside."

He had no more than opened the window
when an exclamation burst from his lips, and
without delay I clambered up beside him.[Pg 290]

From this point of vantage we had a fairly
good view of what was going on near about the
Capitol building, and my heart beat fast and
furiously with fear as I saw the enemy advancing.

"There seems to be the biggest part of the
British army," Darius said, pointing in the
direction of the burying-ground, where I could
see the soldiers bivouacking for the night; but
nearer at hand were two officers, evidently high
in command       General Ross and Admiral Cockburn,
as I afterward learned       , with an escort
of three or four hundred men, riding directly toward
us.

Within full view of our hiding-place was a
dwelling standing near the government building,
and as we gazed I saw the flash of a musket
come from this house, when the horse on
which the general was riding fell dead, carrying
the officer to the ground with him in what
looked to be an ugly fall.

"That's a fool trick!" Darius cried angrily
when no other sign of attack could be seen or
heard. "A crazy man must have fired that shot,
which can do no other good than to make the
enemy hot to inflict some punishment!"

We saw a score or more of the escort rush
to the assistance of the officer, while the remainder
of the soldiers were wheeled about to
face the dwelling.[Pg 291]

I was confident that they would fire a volley
into the house, and, indeed, I could well have
excused such a course, considering the provocation;
but instead of this a squad of men were
told off to enter the building, as we saw when
the force ran forward on the double-quick with
fixed bayonets.

By this time, as may well be imagined, all our
party, with the exception of my father, were
clinging to the timbers of the building that a
view might be had of what was going on outside,
and Darius, ever mindful of others, took it upon
himself to keep our invalid informed of what was
being done.

"They've sent a squad of men to clean out the
house, I reckon," the old sailor said for father's
benefit. "The officer ain't hurt so but that he
can mount a spare horse which a colonel has just
brought him. Now the two in command are
pointin' out the different buildin's; looks as if
they were pickin' out their quarters. There's one
thing certain, fine birds like them won't want to
sleep in a smoke-house, so we ain't likely to be
turned out right away."

I interrupted the report by exclaiming aloud
in my excitement, for I saw smoke issuing from
the dwelling, which I afterward learned was the
home of Mr. Robert Sewall, and then it was I
understood for what purpose the squad had been
sent.[Pg 292]

"They've fired the house," Darius continued to
my father, "an' without givin' them who may be
livin' there a chance to carry anythin' out. Soldiers
are stationed to prevent the people from
tryin' to fight the flames, an' it wouldn't surprise
me if we saw a pretty hot time in this town."

At this moment a squad of men was sent to the
rope-walk, another to the tavern hard by our
place of refuge, and a third to the next building,
which from the sign on its front I knew to be the
National Intelligencer newspaper.

After what we had seen it was not difficult to
guess the purpose of these soldiers, and Darius
said to my father:

"They're firin' the rope-walk now, an' it looks
as if the whole city might go."

"Surely the British wouldn't do so barbarous
a deed!" my father exclaimed. "War isn't carried
on in that way these days."

"It seems to be goin' so now. There comes the
smoke from the tavern, an' men are stationed to
prevent the people from savin' anything. How
about it, lads? If we had spent our last cent
hirin' a room there, the smoke would be forcin'
us out by this time, an' we'd soon find ourselves
prisoners in the hands of such as stand ready to
burn a city where are mostly women an' children!"

"It's not certain but that we'll be forced out as
it is!" I exclaimed. "When the tavern barns[Pg 293]
get afire this smoke-house stands a good chance of
burning."

"It may be, lad; but the wind draws in on the
other side, an' I'm allowin' that this shanty, small
as it is, won't come to harm, though if it does go,
we'll try to keep our upper lips stiff so the villainous
red-coats shan't have a chance to crow
over us very much."

We saw the men comprising the escort now
break ranks, each going, apparently, where he
pleased, and Darius cried in anger:

"It is to be a reg'lar sack of the city, such as
we're told they had in the old times, when men
were reckoned as bein' little better than brutes!
Work like this will count big for the Britishers
before the other nations of the world! There
goes a crowd of soldiers into the little shop beyond
the tavern; they're plunderin' it in piratical
style! See 'em throw the goods out into the
street! The red-coats from the encampment,
scentin' booty, are comin' up by the hundreds!"

From where we were perched it was possible
to see three shops, and by the time the tavern was
well afire no less than five hundred men had
robbed these, tramping into the dirt such goods
as they did not want to carry away, and then the
buildings were set on fire.

Verily it was a barbarous sack of the city!

Then it was, when the flames from the buildings
of which I have spoken were mounting high[Pg 294]
in the sky, that I observed the commander order
up a full company of soldiers. It was possible
to see, for although night had come the fire
lighted up surrounding objects as at noonday,
that he gave them orders at great length, after
which they started off toward the Capitol at full
speed.

"They're goin' to burn the government buildin's!"
Darius cried for my father's benefit. "A
hundred or more have been detailed to do the
work, an' the commanders are watchin' proceedin's
like that chap, I forget his name, who played
on the fiddle while Rome was burnin'. An' all
this is bein' done by the high an' lofty Britishers,
who count on settin' the pace for the whole
world!"

Jim Freeman and Dody Wardwell, who could
not find perches near the window that they might
look out, now opened the door regardless of consequences,
and stood gazing at as cruel a scene
as can well be imagined.

Women and children, driven back by the red-coats,
stood tearfully watching the destruction of
their homes, forced to see every cherished article
destroyed, and, more than that! I saw a soldier
tear from the hands of an old lady a small box
which he opened, took some things therefrom
which I judged were pieces of jewelry, and threw
the remainder into the flames.

The smoke-house was as hot a place as I care[Pg 295]
to remain in very long at a time, and as well
filled with smoke as when put to the use for
which it was originally intended. Even Darius
had doubts about the small buildings escaping
the flames, and said to my father:

"Keep watch for the first show of fire, Master
Grout, an' we'll see that you're posted as to what
is bein' done outside. If we have to leave here,
it'll be a good idee to draw off toward the rope-walk;
there's no one near by that place, an' we
may contrive to steer clear of the enemy."

Now it was that long tongues of fire curled
above the government building, swaying this way
and that in the wind like fiery serpents, until
the inflammable portion of the nation's Capitol
was ablaze.

It seemed as if our smoke-house was completely
surrounded by burning buildings. Had the Britishers
given any attention to such an insignificant
structure as we were concealed in, Jim and
Dody must have been discovered, for they gave
no heed to hiding themselves as they stood literally
transfixed with horror at the terrible
scenes.

Not until all the buildings were so enveloped
in flames that there could be no possibility of saving
them, did the two officers ride away, and then
it was to go in the direction of their encampment.

I gave no further heed to the barbarians; but[Pg 296]
watched with a sort of fascination the destroying
element until Darius cried:

"There's more mischief afoot! See, a full
regiment are under marchin' orders!"

"What can they do now?" I asked helplessly.
"Everything around here is in flames; the entire
city is ruined!"

"There's the President's house, an' a good
many fine dwellin's at the other end of the town,"
the old sailor replied. "Unless I'm way out of my
reckonin', you'll see more fire before there's less."

The barns of the tavern were now burning; but
the wind drew in with greater force, a draft having
been formed by the flames, I suppose, and
while our refuge was as hot as it well could be,
the more intense heat was carried in the opposite
direction.

"I reckon this 'ere smoke-house will stand
while many a better buildin' goes down," Darius
announced. "We're gettin' the biggest part of
the heat from the stables now, an' I don't see any
signs of fire on these logs. You lads stay here
with our invalid, an' I'll sneak 'round outside a
bit. There may be a chance to get somethin' in
the way of rations if the men break into more
shops, as is likely."

Then the old man slipped down from his uncomfortable
perch, stopped at the door to warn
Jim and Dody that they must not stray far away,
and disappeared behind the ruins of the tavern.[Pg 297]

It gave me a certain sensation of loneliness to
have Darius go at that time. Although it was
late in the day to make such a discovery, I had
come to understand of how much assistance he
was to us lads, and how helpless we would be
without him; but, as a matter of course, I could
not presume to dictate as to his movements.

The one singular thing to me in this wanton
work of destruction, was the fact that not all the
buildings in this portion of the city had been
given over to the flames. It seemed as if the
British commander had singled out certain dwellings
to be burned, while the others were unmolested,
save in two cases where I saw soldiers
bringing out plunder which was valueless to
them, and had been taken only in a spirit of
cruelty.

Perhaps an hour was spent by the enemy in our
immediate vicinity, and then that quarter of the
city was deserted by all save the homeless ones,
or those who mourned over the loss of property.

The conflagration was still sufficient to light
up the streets and fields near by, therefore we
could not venture out save at the risk of being
seen; but I question if any especial attention
would have been given us, except in the case of
my father, had we gone boldly forth.

Had he not been with us I should have proposed
that the moment was come when we might
be able to slip down the river unobserved, for[Pg 298]
who would give heed to a party of lads when the
capital city of the United States was in flames?
With my father, however, we were forced to remain
in hiding, for his wound was sufficient evidence
that he had taken part in the battle of
Bladensburg, and this would insure his being
seized as a prisoner of war.

Jim and Dody, however, went across to where
two shops were in flames, and returned a few
moments later with a piece of bacon which had
been trampled upon in the street, a bag of dirty
flour, and, what was better than all, three loaves
of bread, the whole of which had been thrown
aside by the Britishers when they plundered the
buildings.

It was quite a store for our empty larder, unsavory
though the bread and flour looked; but
hungry lads, and particularly those who are fugitives,
cannot afford to be squeamish in regard to
their food.

In less than half an hour after the regiment
marched from the encampment toward the upper
end of the city, we saw the flames rising in great
volume, telling that there was no idea in the
minds of the victors to spare anything which
could readily be destroyed.

As a matter of course, we did not then know
what was being done; but later we learned that
the President's mansion, the Treasury buildings,
the Arsenal, and the barracks, where three thou[Pg 299]sand
troops could be quartered, were all laid in
ashes under the orders of General Ross and
Admiral Cockburn.

Before midnight the conflagration in the portion
of the city where we had sought refuge, had
so far subsided, because there was nothing left
for the flames to feed upon, that only glowing
embers, and the blackened walls of the Capitol
could be seen; but the night was turned into day
because of the fires at the other end of the town.

We lads were weary with watching the wicked
work; Jim and Dody had toasted a large piece of
bacon over the embers of the tavern; we had partaken
of a second meal rather because the food
was at hand than owing to hunger, and now all
hands felt the need of sleep, even though we were
literally surrounded by enemies.

But Darius had not returned, and we could not
give ourselves up to slumber while he remained
absent.

At first I fancied that he was watching the
work of the Britishers; but when my father
began to show signs of alarm because the old
sailor did not return, my anxiety was great.

If any of the red-coats came upon him, they
would suspect that he had been among that company
of seamen and marines who had inflicted
so much injury upon them during the day just
passed, and it was not difficult to understand
that he would speedily be made a prisoner.

CHAPTER XVII.

MISSING.


I am minded to set down here what I afterward
saw printed, concerning the doings in other
portions of Washington, the particulars of which
we were ignorant at the time.

"While the public buildings in Washington
were in flames, the national shipping, stores,
and other property were blazing at the navy
yard; also the great bridge over the Potomac,
from Washington city to the Virginia shore.

"Commodore Thomas Tingey was in command
of the navy yard, and, before the battle, had received
orders to set fire to the public property
there in event of the British gaining a victory,
so as to prevent its falling into the hands of the
invaders. Tingey delayed the execution of the
order for four hours after the contingency had
occurred.

"When, at half-past eight in the evening, he
was informed that the enemy was encamped within
the city limits, near the Capitol, he applied the
torch, and property valued at about a million
of dollars was destroyed.[Pg 301]

"The schooner Lynx was saved, and most of
the metallic work at the navy yard remained but
little injured. The fine naval monument was
somewhat mutilated, but whether accidentally at
the time of the conflagration, or wantonly by the
British, who went there the next day to complete
the destructive work, is an unsettled question.

"At the same time, the Long bridge over the
Potomac was fired at both ends. The Americans
on the Virginia side thought a large body of
British troops were about to pass over, and fired
that end to foil them, while the British on the
city side, perceiving, as they thought, a large
body of Americans about to cross over from the
Virginia side, fired the Maryland end of the
bridge. The value of the entire amount of property
destroyed at Washington by the British and
Americans was estimated at about two million
dollars."

While we awaited the coming of Darius
Thorpe, and believing that the city of Washington
would be totally destroyed before the Britishers
had gratified their desire for vengeance,
Jerry started a subject which caused me to be
more uncomfortable in mind than I had been
concerning the absence of the old sailor.

"The enemy are bent on burnin' all the government
buildin's in the city, even if they do no
more, an' what about the jails?"[Pg 302]

I was at a loss to fully understand the question;
but my father replied:

"They won't go so far as to burn the prisoners,
lad. All that crowd of evil-doers will be set
at liberty, and I reckon they'll be the only Americans
who can rejoice because of the English victory
at Bladensburg.

"Then in that case," Jerry said grimly, "we
can set it down as a fact that Elias Macomber is
paradin' the streets with his good friends the
British, boastin' of his suffering at the hand of
the Americans."

I started up in very unpleasant surprise. Until
this moment I had given no heed to the cur
whom we had captured twice, since we left the
burning fleet at Pig Point; but now I realized
that my partner was right. There could be no
question but that Elias Macomber was a free
man once more, and all our efforts to bring him
to justice had only resulted in giving him an
opportunity to pose as a martyr!

"Well, he's got a chance to pay off old scores
now, if he only knew it," Jim Freeman suggested.
"How happy the villain would be if he knew
where he could find us in hidin'!"

"Don't talk about him," I said petulantly.
"It makes me heartsick to think that after all
our work he is in fine feather, strutting around
the city as one of the best friends the British
had in this section. Speak of something else.[Pg 303]
What of Bill Jepson? Does any one know if
he came out of the battle alive?"

"I saw him not more than five minutes before
the order was given to retreat," my father said.
"He had been sent back to the wagons for ammunition,
and appeared to be having a royal
time."

"We'll hope he got away at the last, for if he's
taken they'll hang him as a deserter," I said, and
then, finding it impossible to prevent my thoughts
from straying to our missing comrade, I added,
"Darius wouldn't have stayed away so long unless
something serious had happened. We ought
to go in search of him."

"Where would you look first?" Jerry asked.
"If the Britishers got their hands on him we
stand little chance of seein' the poor fellow, for
they'll keep him a close prisoner."

"It doesn't seem possible that we can accomplish
very much," I said with a long drawn sigh;
"but we must do as he would if one of us was
missing."

"And what would that be?" my father asked.

"I wish I knew, sir. He surely would search
for us, as we must for him; but I am all at sea as
to how the work should be begun."

Every member of the party was eager to be
doing something, but so far as having any plan
in mind, they were all like me, and we sat there
staring at each other like a lot of frightened rabbits
until I could remain idle no longer.[Pg 304]

"I'm going out somewhere!" I cried. "Almost
anything is better than sitting here in suspense,
when it may be that he has simply fallen
into difficulties from which we might extricate
him."

"But what of the British?" my father asked,
and I replied recklessly:

"We must take our chances as to them, sir.
It does not seem probable that two or three
lads would be looked upon by them with suspicion,
for there must be many wandering around
the city this night."

"Who will go with you?"

"That's for me to do," Jerry said promptly.
"The other fellows will stay here with you, sir,
and the door must not be opened without good
reason. Keep under cover while we are gone,"
he added to Jim, "an' don't let one of the boys
so much as stick his nose outside. Come on,
Amos, the longer we stand here talkin' about it
the greater will the danger appear."

Then he stepped outside quickly, and I followed
his example, closing the door behind me
lest father should attempt to say something in
the nature of a farewell, which I knew would unnerve
me, because I believed it was exceedingly
dangerous for any of our party to move around
the city.

When we were alone in the night, where the
shadows were distorted by the dancing glow
[Pg 305]of the live embers on every hand, Jerry said
grimly:

"It was foolish to make any talk about what
we would do toward findin' Darius, while we
were in the smoke-house, because we might have
argued till mornin' without comin' to any conclusion;
but now that we've started out I'd like
to know how we're goin' to work?"

I could make no satisfactory reply to this question,
and plainly told him so. We had nothing to
guide us on the search. The old man had given
us no idea of where he might go, and all we knew
was that he disappeared beyond the burning
tavern.

"He wouldn't have followed the Britishers," I
said after a long pause, "therefore it seems foolish
to look for him at the other end of the city.
If we only knew what he went after!"

"I reckon the first thing in his mind was to
get food, and he might have thought that could
be done where the shops were bein' robbed."

"And then would come to his mind the question
as to how we might get down the river while
father is unable to walk," I added, believing that
by thus trying to make out what Darius was most
likely to do we could hit upon a plan for the
search.

"The only way we'd be able to leave this city
by water, if we wanted to get home, would be on
the Potomac river, an' he'd need a stout canoe for
such a voyage."
[Pg 306]
We were not coming to any understanding by
this line of thought, therefore I harked back to
the belief that he might have followed the
Britishers to the upper end of the city, and proposed,
knowing of no better course, to walk in
that direction.

The day was beginning to dawn. No soldiers
were to be seen on the streets, and I began to
believe that the invaders, wearied with their
work of destruction, had returned to the encampment
near the burying-ground.

We came upon the ruins of the President's
mansion; the fire had eaten out the interior of the
building, but the walls were yet standing, and
near about, apparently having neither purpose
nor business there, were an hundred people or
more, all gazing at the evidences of the most approved
method of making war by the British
standard.

We mingled with these idlers to make certain
Darius was not among them, and then went toward
the other ruins on a like errand, but with
no success.

It was sunrise, perhaps a little later, when we
stood near the ruins of the barracks, where a
number of negroes were digging amid the glowing
embers with the hope of finding weapons which
might be restored to a condition of usefulness
after being subjected to such great heat.

One of these searchers for useless treasure[Pg 307]
straightened up as we approached, and I saw
that he was an old man, who looked as if he
might have been a gentleman's servant.

"Do you live here in Washington, uncle?" I
asked, and the old darkey replied:

"I'se ain't noways conditioned fur to answer
dat question, sah, kase I dunno whar massa am
ter be foun' dese yere queer days wha' we'se
habin'."

"Who is your master?"

"Massa Clayton, sah. He's foolin' 'roun' wid
some ob dem militious men; but I ain't foun' out
wedder he whipped de Britishers, or ef dey done
gone got de bes' ob him."

"I reckon you can say that he has got the
worst of it up to the present time, for your 'militious'
men didn't make any great showing," I
said with a laugh, and then there came into my
mind the memory of Elias Macomber. "Tell me,
uncle, where did the American soldiers keep their
prisoners?"

"Right hyar, sah; I'se done seed de barracks
jail many a time."

"Were you around here when the building
was fired?"

"Yes sah, I stood right hyar when de ossifers
rode up."

"Did they set the prisoners free?"

"Sure enuf, honey, more'n twenty ob dem, an'
I'se tellin' you dat dem white men was mighty
glad fo' to get clear so easy like."[Pg 308]

"Come on, Amos," Jerry said impatiently.
"You can do no good talkin' with the old darkey,
for he doesn't know anything concerning our
business."

I recognized that fact fully, and yet I lingered
to ask one more question, never fancying of how
much importance the answer might be to us.

"Where do the British keep their prisoners?
Surely they must have brought in some since the
battle, and these barracks would have been a
prime place for anything of the kind."

"Dey is pilin' de 'Mericans inter dat stone
house back ob whar de arsenal uster was 'fore it
got set on fire las' night."

"Where is that, uncle?" Jerry cried excitedly,
and the old darkey replied as he pointed out the
direction:

"Ober yander, sah, des whar you'se kin see de
red roof."

Now it was that I understood what was in
Jerry's mind, and only with difficulty could I
restrain myself from running forward at full
speed.

If Darius had been captured, then it was in the
"stone house" he must be confined, and I believed
our search would be at an end if we could
look into every portion of that building.

There were many loungers near about, and no
one might say how many were British spies or
sympathizers, therefore we remained looking at[Pg 309]
the men who were digging amid the ruins until
feeling certain our departure would not attract
undue attention.

There were many lads of about our age idling
on the streets, watching simply from curiosity
the movements of the enemy, and I said to myself
that if we were careful to do nothing which
might cause suspicion, we could walk wheresoever
we pleased without fear of being taken for
lads who, under Commodore Barney, had given
the invaders such good battle for the possession
of the hill at Bladensburg.

"Now we know where Darius is!" Jerry exclaimed
when we were where there was little
danger our words would be overheard.

"How can you be so certain of that? He
might have come to grief in many another way
than that of being gobbled up by the enemy."

"In any other case I'll warrant he'd have contrived
to send some word to us. I'm convinced
he's in the 'stone house.'"

"In which event I'm afraid we can't be of
much assistance to the poor fellow. The Britishers
will take good care that their prisoners don't
escape."

"I'm not so certain about that," Jerry replied
stoutly. "In case we have time enough, it
should be possible to do somethin'. If we could
let him know that we're near at hand I'll go bail
he'd cook up some kind of a plan."[Pg 310]

While thus talking we had been walking at a
reasonably rapid pace toward the ruins of the
arsenal, and were now arrived so near that it
was possible to see the red-coated sentries pacing
to and fro in front of the building. At one side
a number of soldiers were bivouacked, probably
that they might be on hand in case the prisoners
attempted to rise against the keepers, and here,
there, everywhere were curious ones       perhaps
some interested as were we       gazing at the small
building where were so many brave fellows, most
likely penned up like cattle.

"The greater number of those idlers must be
townspeople, and since they are allowed to loiter
around the buildin' there's no good reason why
we shouldn't do the same," Jerry said as I came
to a halt, and he had hardly more than spoken
before he stepped back very suddenly, pulling
me with him.

"What's the matter?" I asked in alarm, for at
such a time one's fears rise rapidly.

"Look at that fellow who is standin' on his tiptoes
to look in at the window!" my partner whispered,
and obeying, I saw that miserable cur
whom we had twice captured, and who had contrived
to escape us the same number of times.

"Elias Macomber!" I cried involuntarily.

"Ay," Jerry replied, "an' now I can read you
the whole riddle. Darius came around this way
when the prisoners were set free; Macomber saw[Pg 311]
him, and gave information to the enemy, thus
causin' the old man's arrest. Now the villain
is tryin' to get a glimpse of the sailor in order
to crow over him!"

I had no doubt but that the lad had come very
near the truth in his guessing; but I did not
speculate upon it very long, for the question in
my mind was whether we could be of any service
to the old man who had served us so truly and
faithfully.

"What's to be done?" Jerry asked as we
stepped behind a clump of bushes in a nearby
garden where we might not be seen by the fellow
who would have rejoiced if he could have put us
in the same place with Darius.

At the moment Jerry spoke I had never an idea
as to what might be done; but I replied as if
the plan was plainly mapped out in my mind:

"You shall go back to the smoke-house and tell
father and the lads what we have learned. Say
that we may not be back until dark; but they are
to stay under cover no matter what happens,
short of being discovered by the British. I'll
watch here till Macomber goes away, for he isn't
likely to play at that game all day, and you
should be back within an hour."

Jerry started off without stopping to argue the
question, and I was left alone to keep in view the
man who could do us so much mischief if he had
an inkling that we were in the vicinity.[Pg 312]

Twice he spoke with the sentinel, as if asking
some favor, and each time the man shook his
head decidedly, therefore I concluded that the
cur had tried to enter the building that he might
jeer such of the prisoners as had been friends
of his in the past.

Then he peered in at the window again, never
making an effort to look through any other, and
I concluded that from such position he could see
the prisoner he had most reason to hate, which,
of course, must be Darius.

I did not dare remain in one position all the
while, lest some one see that I was spying upon
the prison and grow suspicious as to my motives,
while Macomber was so intent upon gazing at his
enemies that I might have brushed past him without
attracting attention.

Therefore it was that I paced to and fro, never
taking my eyes from the cur, however, and making
certain there was a place of concealment near
at hand into which I could dart at a moment's
warning.

Not until fully half an hour had passed did he
abandon his fruitless efforts, and then he walked
in the direction of the British encampment as if
with some fixed purpose in his mind, which, I
had no doubt, was to ask for a permit to visit
the prisoners.

Had he gone toward any other quarter of the
city it would have pleased me to see him go; but
[Pg 313]now I was sorely distressed in mind, for his way
led the same course Jerry must pursue when returning
from the smoke-house, and it would be
the irony of fate if the two should come face to
face.

However, that was an evil which I could not
mend, and, therefore, I put the matter from my
mind so far as possible, while I set about doing
the only thing which seemed to promise a chance
to have speech with our comrade.

I proposed to take Macomber's place at the
window, and if it was possible to see Darius inside,
there was no question in my mind but that
I could contrive to attract his attention.

There was no little danger in making the attempt,
because I might thus arouse suspicion in
the mind of the sentry, or be seen by an officer
who would insist on knowing why I was there;
but it was the only way by which I could have
speech with Darius, if indeed he was a prisoner,
and I determined to take the chances.

I lounged across the street as if having no particular
purpose in view; walked past the end of
the building twice, peering about me like a
simple, and then stepped up to the window.

One glance inside and I saw the man for whom
I had been searching. He was lying at full length
on the floor, chewing tobacco most industriously,
and seated tailor-fashion beside him was Bill
Jepson.
[Pg 314]
There were very many militiamen in the room;
but these two old shell-backs seemed to hold
themselves aloof from the others, and I could
well understand that this exclusiveness was because
of the cowardice shown by many of the toy
soldiers the day previous.

Neither Darius nor Bill seemed to be paying
any attention to what was going on around them,
and I began to realize that it might not be as
simple a matter to attract their attention as I
had supposed.

I did not dare do anything which would cause
the sentry to be curious, or be noticed particularly
by those who were passing in either direction,
therefore the most I ventured was to drum
idly on the glass with the tips of my fingers,
which was not a difficult task since the iron bars
were so far apart that I could thrust my entire
arm between them and the window-sash.

Darius was not as heedless to the surroundings
as he appeared. No sooner had I begun to tap
ever so gently than he looked up, and after one
quick, meaning glance, rose leisurely to his feet,
speaking softly meanwhile to Bill.

The latter never so much as looked toward me;
but the two moved here or there as if weary with
remaining long in one position, and all the while
they were approaching the window.

Then Darius leaned against the sash, with Bill
facing the middle of the room, as he talked with
many gesticulations to his companion.[Pg 315]

I noticed that the old man bent over as if
weary, until his face was very near the glass,
and while Bill waved his arms as if in the midst
of a heated argument, I saw Darius' lips move.

"On the roof       to-night       bring rope       ten
o'clock."

No less than three times were these words repeated,
I reading them from the motion of his
lips, for as a matter of course he did not dare
to speak so loud that I could hear him.

Then I went through the same motions with
my lips, in order to make certain there could
be no mistake, and Darius nodded his head in
token that I had the words correctly.

Now it was my business to get away from the
prison as soon as possible, for Elias Macomber
might return at any moment, and I backed into
the street while gazing at the top of the building,
looking, most likely, the greenest lad that
ever visited a city.

While thus acting the simple I was making
ready for whatsoever plan Darius wanted to
carry into effect, for I studied the outside of the
jail until I could tell within a foot of how much
rope would be needed.

The "stone house" was three stories in height,
with an ordinary pitched roof from which projected
four chimneys       two at each end. From
the eaves to the ground I judged it was not less
than thirty feet, and from the eaves to the nearest[Pg 316]
chimney, measuring at whichsoever corner you
chose, was ten feet. To that length add three
feet for a turn around the chimney and two half-hitches,
and one had the length of rope Darius
wanted       say forty-three or four feet.

I noticed that on the side of the roof nearest
the street was a trap-door or scuttle very nearly
in the middle, well up toward the ridge-pole, and
it must be that our comrades would come through
that, since I saw no other way by which they
could get outside.

Without doubt those two old shell-backs had
made a careful survey of the place within ten
minutes after being imprisoned, and had a plan
for escape mapped out ready to be carried into
execution, providing any aid could be had from
the outside.

By the time I had backed entirely across the
street I had a picture of the jail in my mind
which could be recalled at any moment, and as I
turned to saunter away I came face to face with
Jerry.

"Have you been over there?" he asked, motioning
toward the "stone house."

"Yes, and have the same as talked with Darius
and Bill Jepson. Let us get out of sight
where we shan't be watched. I was afraid you
would run into Macomber; he started off some
time ago, and I got it into my head that he was
going to the British encampment."[Pg 317]

"I reckon that's where he was bound for. I
kept my eyes open mighty wide both goin' an'
comin', therefore saw the cur while he was a
long distance away, otherwise we might have run
into each other as you an' I did."

"All right at the smoke-house?"

"Snug as bugs, an' your father is as chipper as
a sparrow."

Then I led the way up what appeared to be a
lane in the rear of some dwelling, until we were
where we could talk without danger of being
seen or heard.



[Pg 318]
CHAPTER XVIII.

THE ESCAPE.


Jerry was thoroughly astonished, after I had
told my story, because we had had such plain
sailing when there was nothing to start us on a
course for the missing comrade. We had gone
out blindly, and by sheer accident ran upon our
man without trouble or delay.

"It heartens a fellow to have things happen
this way," my partner said in a tone of satisfaction.
"There's no question but that we're in
a bad box, take it all around, for after the British
get settled down in the city they will most likely
look about for such as us, therefore our work
must be done quickly, an' by your hittin' the nail
square on the head it looks as if we might pull
through all right."

The future did not look so promising to me.
Darius and Bill undoubtedly knew that they
could gain the roof of the "stone house" during
the night; but even then they were far from being
free, and I questioned if it would be possible for[Pg 319]
us to loiter around the building after sunset without
attracting the attention of the sentries.

However, it was not for me to throw cold
water, because a fellow needs all his courage
when he would do that which lay before us, and
it was well Jerry should feel confident as to the
result.

Therefore it was that instead of discussing how
we could set about rendering the necessary aid,
I began by questioning as to how the rope might
be procured, and, as a matter of fact, it was by
no means a simple matter to get one of the
desired length.

"We've got to buy it, of course," Jerry said
quickly, and as if it was possible for us to make
such purchases at any time.

"In the first place we haven't money enough,"
I suggested, "and secondly, how many shops will
you find open in this city?"

These questions were sufficient to let Jerry
understand that it was not all plain sailing before
us, and after some reflection he said:

"Suppose we go back to the smoke-house?
There we can talk it over with the others, an' at
the same time get something by way of breakfast."

There was plenty of time at our disposal, since
Darius had set ten o'clock that night as the hour
when we could aid him, and I welcomed my partner's
proposition; but instead of going directly[Pg 320]
to the place of refuge, I insisted on making a
long detour to lessen the chances of running
across Elias Macomber.

That the cur had gone to the encampment hoping
to get a permit to see the prisoners, in order
to gloat over their misfortune, I had no doubt,
and if he was successful I felt equally certain he
would go to the jail by the shortest route. In
event of failure, however, and I was positive he
would fail, the villain might wander anywhere
while working off his disappointment, therefore
it stood us in hand to be exceeding cautious.

As it proved, however, we had seen the last of
that miserable British-lover, and after Jerry saw
him on the street, he passed out of our lives for
many months.

I believed of a verity that we walked at least
three miles, cutting across lots here, or traveling
many rods out of our course there, until it seemed
as if we had traversed every lane and obscure
passage to be found in the city. But we arrived
safely at last, which repaid us for all the extra
work; we had seen no one who gave any heed to
us, and when we sneaked into the smoke-house
from behind the ruins of the tavern, I felt positive
no one saw us.

It can well be supposed that our comrades gave
us a hearty welcome, and when I explained how
much had been accomplished, they became quite
as certain of ultimate success as Jerry; but the[Pg 321]
question of procuring a rope put the matter in
a different light.

We counted every penny belonging to the
party, and had less than three shillings, while
the length of rope we needed would cost three
or four times as much.

"It's certain we can't buy one, even though
all the shop-keepers in the city stood ready to
wait upon us," I said after we had ascertained
the amount of capital on hand. "Now what is to
be done?"

No one answered for many minutes, and then
Jim Freeman proposed that if we couldn't get
what we needed in any other way, it would be
admissible to steal the rope, in view of the use
to which it would be put.

Dody Wardwell thought we might go to a shopkeeper
who dealt in such goods, and, telling the
story, beg what was needed.

It was my father who solved the riddle.

"I don't believe we are warranted in stealing,"
he said, "no matter what might be accomplished,
neither do I think it safe to confide in any
stranger whom you should meet; but the begging
proposition, if carried out properly, comes nearer
filling the bill than anything else."

"What do you call doin' it properly?" Jerry
asked.

"There must be oystermen in port, either here,
at Georgetown, or Alexander, and the chances[Pg 322]
are you would know some of them. Go round the
water front, and see what can be found. Then
try the other towns, and I'll guarantee you can
strike an acquaintance somewhere. After that
everything is simple, for you may borrow a rope
without fear that information will be lodged
against you."

"Come on, Amos!" Jerry cried, springing to
his feet in excitement. "Your father has hit
upon the very plan, an' we were thick-headed not
to have thought of it at first!"

There was no time to be lost, more particularly
in case we should be forced to visit the two
towns mentioned; but I believe that we would
really be forwarding the business if we delayed
long enough to get something to eat, and my comrades
were of the same opinion.

Jim had tried his hand at making bread by
mixing flour and water together, and baking the
stuff in an old tin pan over the embers of the
tavern ruins. It was possible to eat the mixture,
and that was the best that could be said, therefore
we satisfied our hunger with raw bacon and
imitation bread, which did not require very many
minutes.

Jim and both the other fellows were eager to
go with Jerry and me; but they would not be able
to forward matters, and it seemed like taking
too many risks to make our party so large, therefore
we decided that they must stay in the smoke-[Pg 323]house
as before, a decision which was not to their
liking, although neither of the lads made any protest.

Then Jerry and I set out, after listening to
such advice as my father had to give, and began
the search on the Eastern Branch.

There were but few vessels in port; the greater
number of those that remained when the enemy
entered the Potomac had run up the river as high
as possible lest they be destroyed, and we did
not find an oyster pungy until we were well over
toward Georgetown.

It was then near noon, and Jerry and I decided
that if the captain of the boat before us
looked like an honest seaman, we would take the
chances of telling him so much of our story as
might be necessary, rather than run the risk of
not finding another craft of the kind.

There were no sign of life on deck; but as we
went over the rail the companion-way hatch was
opened a few inches, and some one cried:

"What's wanted? This vessel is hauled up for
repairs, an' there's nobody here but me       the
keeper."

"Will you let us come below for a short time?"
I asked, and the hatch was closed very suddenly
as the voice cried emphatically:

"No; my orders are to allow no company
here."

"Let me have a try at the old idiot," Jerry[Pg 324]
said in a low tone as he went toward the companion-way,
and the voice from below replied, thus
showing that he could hear very well even though
the hatch was closed:

"The 'old idiot' don't want any truck with
boys, so keep off or I'll make it hot for you!"

"Listen to me, shipmate, and then perhaps
you'll sing a different tune," I said, going close
to the companion-way where it might not be
necessary to raise my voice. "We are a couple
of oystermen from Benedict, in trouble, and are
looking for some one to lend a hand."

"Tell me your names?"

I gave the desired information, and added:

"We owned the pungy Avenger, which was
burned at Pig Point when the enemy came up the
river."

The hatch was opened in a twinkling, and when
we descended to the cuddy I was both surprised
and overjoyed by seeing Robert Hanaford, an
oysterman from St. Leonard's bay.

"Shut that hatch," he said nervously, and
Jerry did as he was bidden. "I got caught in
the river, like a fool, an' am now expectin' the
bloomin' Britishers will burn the craft when they
fall short of like amusement in the city. Tell
me how you happened to be here?"

I told him so much of our story as seemed
necessary, and when I was come to the retreat
from Bladensburg, he said grumpily:[Pg 325]

"I reckon you two lads an' Darius Thorpe are
bigger fools than I am. It was accident that
brought me into this scrape, whereas you got into
a muss with your eyes wide open. Where's
Darius?"

"The Britishers are holding him prisoner, and
count on sending him down to the fleet, I suppose."

"He'll rot there, unless he offers to serve the
king, in which case, seein's how the enemy needs
good sailors, they'll give him a show that a dog
wouldn't welcome."

"Did you ever run across Bill Jepson from
Baltimore?" I asked at random, not knowing
exactly how to lead up to the request for a
rope.

"Ay, that I have, lad. Bill an' me run on this
same pungy more'n two years. I've heard it said
that one of the king's press gangs gathered him
in."

Then I told the captain how we had helped
Bill to desert, and wound up the story by sayin:

"Bill is a prisoner with Darius, and will be
hung when the Britishers learn who he is.
There's a show to help both the sailors out of
the scrape; but we're needing six or eight fathom
of good manilla rope, an' haven't got the money
with which to buy it."

"How do you count on usin' it?" and Captain[Pg 326]
Hanaford leaned forward in a manner which told
that he was thoroughly excited.

Then I told him all we had accomplished that
morning, and explained what Darius proposed
we should do, whereupon he cried heartily:

"Take anything I've got, lads, an' if it so be
I can lend a hand, count on me to the finish.
I'll risk even the pungy to help a sailorman out
of a hole, an' a good deal more'n that when it
comes to bein' Bill Jepson who's in trouble!"

Now that we were assured of getting what was
needed, there was no need of great haste, and I
told the captain the remainder of our story, even
to describing where father and the lads were
hiding.

"Whether you get Bill an' Darius out of jail
or not, you'll be wantin' to go down the river,
lad, so why don't you bring all hands aboard?
I've known your father this many a day, an'
would like to do him a good turn. We'd be a
little crowded, I reckon; but some of you youngsters
can bunk in the hold, an' if the Britishers
don't burn the pungy, she'll be a sight better than
a smoke-house."

"What about provisions, captain?" Jerry
asked.

"I've got enough an' to spare, unless we're
held here a couple of weeks. I didn't count on
doin' any fightin' in this 'ere war; but when it
comes to lendin' shipmates an' neighbors a hand,[Pg 327]
you'll find that Bob Hanaford is willin' to go
down to his last cent."

I realized what a blessing it would be if we
could get father on board the pungy, where he
would have a comfortable bunk to lie in, and
such nursing as Captain Hanaford might give
when we lads were absent; but how to get him
down to the boat was a puzzle.

"Supposin' you free Darius an' Bill to-night,
what'll you do with 'em?" the owner of the pungy
asked, and I replied mournfully:

"We hadn't got as far as that in our plans.
Of course they must be taken out of the city."

"An' the British fleet is loafin' down in the
river somewhere 'twixt here an' the bay," the
captain added.

"Ay, but if we can get hold of a boat, it
shouldn't be such a hard job to slip by the vessels
on a dark night."

"Would you leave your father behind?"

"Certainly not; he must go with us."

"Then you ought'er have him down here on the
river before beginnin' work. I'll tell you how it
might be fixed, lad. Allowin' that there ain't
any more burnin' of houses to-night, I could help
him through the streets, if it so be he can make
any fist at walkin'. The other lads would set out
on their own hook, an' it should be we'd come together
on this 'ere craft, unless the Britishers are
[Pg 328]overhaulin' everybody that's aboard. I don't
know how things may be runnin', for I haven't
been outside this cuddy since the fires began."

I told him that Jerry and I had not been interfered
with on the streets, and I believed he
could go where he pleased, provided it was not
too near the encampments.

"Then I'll try it, lads, an' start for your hidin'
place within an hour. Can you give me the
bearin's?"

The captain was reasonably familiar with that
portion of the city, and there was no doubt in my
mind but that he could find the smoke-house
without any difficulty.

Then we overhauled his spare rope in the hold,
selecting a length of half-inch manilla which
had been used no more than enough to make it
pliable, and carried it to the cuddy.

It would not be safe to lug the rope through the
streets in the daytime, lest some over officious
person should insist on knowing what we proposed
to do with it. We would be forced to take
a long walk in order to fetch it; but that was of
little consequence compared with the additional
security such a plan seemed to afford.

Then we separated, Captain Hanaford agreeing
to be at the smoke-house within an hour, and
when Jerry and I went over the side of the pungy
it was with lighter hearts than when we came
on board.

It is true that the most dangerous portion of[Pg 329]
the undertaking was yet to be performed; but
everything had turned so favorably for us since
we set out in search of Darius, that we could not
but feel a wonderful degree of courage regarding
the remainder of the task.

Jerry was so well pleased that he would have
talked about what we were to do even on the
street; but I insisted that we should hold our
peace until it was impossible any one could overhear
us, and in silence we made our way toward
the place of refuge.

It is needless for me to attempt to describe the
joy of our comrades when we told them of the
friend we had met, and the plans which had been
laid.

My father showed plainly by his face the relief
of mind because of the possibility that he
might have different quarters.

"I haven't grumbled, because I knew you lads
had about all you could stagger under," he said
when we told him that Captain Hanaford was
bent on trying to get him aboard the pungy. "I
can't stay in this place very much longer, without
taking big chances of going under, for the
wound needs careful attention; but if I can be
with Bob Hanaford everything will come around
shipshape, because he knows by experience what
a gunshot hurt is like."

"Do you think it will be possible to keep on
your feet for such a long distance?" I asked[Pg 330]
anxiously, because until this moment I supposed
my father was getting on as comfortably as a
man in his condition could reasonably expect.

"I'll manage that part of it, lad; the knowledge
of what is to be gained will keep me up."

Well, there is no good reason why I should try
to set down all we said while waiting for the
owner of the pungy, and when he finally arrived,
having had little or no difficulty in finding the
smoke-house, it was as if a great and beneficial
change was immediately apparent.

The captain's first act was to rebandage my
father's wound, Jerry getting him a supply of
fresh water from the well at the ruins of the
tavern, and when that was done he set about
making arrangements for our moving, taking upon
himself the entire direction of affairs, much to
my relief.

His first act was to explain to Jim, Dody and
Josiah the location of the pungy, sending them
off at once, with explicit directions as to the
streets through which they should pass. The
lads were to go into the cuddy without loitering
on deck, and keep the hatch closed and bolted until
his arrival.

Jerry and I were to stay in the smoke-house until
it was time to begin work in behalf of Darius
and Bill, while the captain and my father were
to set out as soon as it was sufficiently dark to
screen them from view of the curious ones.[Pg 331]

Jim and his friends started without delay, welcoming
any change after being shut in from the
open air so long, and when they were gone the
captain announced that he would bring the rope
to the jail shortly before ten o'clock.

"I ain't sayin' but that you two lads could
work the thing as well without me; but I'm achin'
to have a hand in settin' them two old shell-backs
free. You'll find that I won't be in the
way, even if I don't do any good."

It was a big relief to know that we were to have
his assistance, and I so gave him to understand.

After father had been made as comfortable as
was possible under the circumstances, we lounged
around waiting for the night to come; but never
saying another word concerning what we hoped
to do.

I for one was too nervous regarding the possible
outcome to care about holding converse even
with friends, for there was in my mind a very
vivid realization of what would be the result in
case we failed while trying to get the sailors from
the roof of the "stone house," or if they were discovered
when getting through the scuttle.

It seemed very much like death for all hands
concerned if the slightest slip was made, and
when a fellow believes he stands near a violent
end he is not given to speech.

The moments dragged so heavily that it seemed
to me the night would never come. Once during[Pg 332]
this painful time of waiting Jerry spoke of the
possibility that Jim and his friends might lose
their way, or be taken in charge as suspicious
persons; but I could not arouse myself to feel
any anxiety concerning them. My thoughts were
with those two old sailors in jail, and the part
which the British sentries might play while we
were trying to effect their release.

Finally, after it was as if we had spent a full
day in the smoke-house, the sun went down, and
it was yet quite light when Captain Hanaford announced
that he and my father might safely make
the start.

"We've got to steer a roundabout course," he
said, "an' I reckon it'll be plain sailin' from now
till dark. Stay where you are, lads, an' don't so
much as poke your nose out till half-after-nine."

"How shall we be able to tell the time?" I
asked, rather for the sake of saying something,
than because I wanted information.

"You will hear the sentinels at the encampment
often enough to give you a fair idee. Get
there as near as possible to the hour set, an' you'll
find me close at hand."

Then he went out, my father leaning heavily on
his arm, and Jerry and I faced each other in the
gloom, heeding not the fact that we had had nothing
to eat during nearly eight and forty hours,
save the chips of ham and the unsavory mess prepared
by Jim; thinking only of what we were to
do, and the many chances against success.[Pg 333]

It was Jerry who broke a long silence by saying
with an attempt at cheerfulness:

"I don't know of any reason why we should
moon 'round here like a couple of chumps. It
won't help matters any, an' surely it don't improve
my courage."

Then I forced myself to take part in conversation,
speaking of this or that trouble or adventure
in the past; but never once of what might be before
us in the future, and thus the time passed
until we believed we were warranted in setting
forth.

With all due regard to prudence, we went by
the most direct course to the "stone house," never
seeing a Britisher on our way, and it must have
been at least a quarter-hour before the time set,
when we were come to where it was possible to
have a good view of the roof of the jail.

The night was dark, with heavy, ominous looking
clouds hanging low in the sky; but yet we
could have distinguished the form of a man on
the top of the building.

We were half hidden by the clump of bushes
in the garden of the dwelling where I had been
screened from view of Elias Macomber, when we
saw a man approaching leisurely, and looking
from side to side in search of some one.

I recognized Captain Hanaford, and stepped
out to meet him, asking how he and father had
managed to get along.[Pg 334]

"He pulled through all right, lad, an' was lyin'
in my bunk happy as a cricket when I left."

"But you've forgotten the rope!" I exclaimed,
and the captain opened his coat to show me the
line wound around his waist in such a fashion
that one might have come close upon him without
suspecting that he carried anything.

He stepped behind the bush to unwind it, and
while he was thus engaged I distinctly saw the
form of a man emerge from the scuttle-hatch
on the roof of the jail.

"They're coming out!" I whispered excitedly,
and then glanced hurriedly around to learn
where the sentries were stationed.

To my surprise I could not see a single person,
save the soldier who appeared at the corner once
in every two or three minutes as he paced his beat
at the end of the building. It seemed extraordinary
that there should be no others in sight;
but such was the fact, and surely we had no
reason to complain because the enemy was careless.

A few hours later I understood the reason for
this seeming neglect of the prisoners.

My comrades were ready for the work on hand
immediately I gave the alarm, and swiftly the
three of us crossed over, I wondering if it would
be possible for us to throw the rope to the roof
where the sailors could catch it.



As soon as the line was made fast a man slipped down quickly
followed by another. P. 335.


[Pg 335]
As we neared the building I saw that Darius
had already made arrangements for getting one
end of the rope into his possession.

A bit of cloth was swinging to and fro at the
corner of the jail when I arrived, and taking hold
of it curiously, I saw that it was made fast to a
string formed of two or three strands of yarn.

The old sailor had unraveled their socks in
order to procure that which would enable them to
haul up the rope.

There was no need of word or signal. Captain
Hanaford made fast one end of the half-inch
manilla, gave the yarn-twine a jerk in token that
all was ready, and then we payed out on the rope
to make certain it went up without kinks.

In less than three minutes a man slipped down
the line at a rate of speed that must have heated
his hands in great shape, and he was hardly
more than on the ground before the second prisoner
followed.

We had effected the escape, and it now remained
to get under cover in the shortest possible
space of time.

"It won't do to run; but you can keep close at
my heels," the captain said as he set off at a
walk which fully equaled running, and we followed
very closely, I literally holding my breath
as I tried to realize that the task which had
seemed so formidable a few moments previous,
had been accomplished with the greatest ease.



[Pg 336]
CHAPTER XIX.

THE UNEXPECTED.


There is little need for me to set it down that
we neither slackened pace nor halted until we
were in the cuddy of the pungy.

Not a member of our party spoke until we descended
the companion-way stairs, and faced the
lads and my father, who had lighted a candle as
a sort of welcome, and then Darius exclaimed:

"Well I'm blowed if you don't look kind'er
cozy here! Who'd think this crowd had been hob-nobbin'
with the Britishers for the last two or
three days? Bob Hanaford, where did the lads
run afoul of you, an' why didn't you get your
pungy down river before the enemy's fleet came
up?"

There was a deal of handshaking and congratulations
before we settled down to anything like
rational talk, and then Jerry and I told how we
found the captain, and what had happened since
Darius left the smoke-house.

Then it was the old man's turn to give an account
of his misadventures, and this he did after[Pg 337]
refreshing himself with an enormous piece of tobacco.

"I went out, leavin' you people in hidin', with
the idee that if many shops were to be robbed by
the soldiers I might get somethin' to eat out'er
the general wreck. First off nothin' came my
way, an' then I ran square across a basket of
ship's bread. Thinks I, this is good enough for
one trip, an' I gathered the stuff under my arm,
puttin' for the smoke-house under full sail without
bein' noticed by the red-coats, who were
havin' too lively a time to give me much attention.
As luck would have it, the thought never
came into my mind that I had need to look for
anybody but Britishers, an' before I was halfway
to port I struck up agin that sneak, Elias
Macomber.

"Then it was I understood that the red-coats
wasn't the only snags in the road, an' I gave him
one clip on the jaw that I counted would knock
him down an' out; but my calkerlations was
wrong. Instead of topplin' over as a decent man
would have done after gettin' the full weight of
my fist, he began to screech an' yell fit to raise
the dead. My legs moved mighty lively jest then,
for a blind man could have seen what might happen;
but the Britishers had me foul before I'd
more'n got well started. No less than six grappled
me, an' I hauled down my flag, 'cause there
wasn't any sense in makin' a bad matter worse.[Pg 338]

"Them soldiers must have had orders in advance
to lug any prisoners they might take, to
the shanty back of the arsenal, for they steered a
straight course for the place without stoppin' to
ask any man's advice, an' what chafed me more'n
everythin' else was that rat of a Macomber, close
at my heels, as he told what he would do now that
his friends had taken possession of the country.
I contrived to give him one kick on the shins
which I'll guarantee he remembers this minute,
an' then he kept well back in the rear. That's
the end of the yarn, lads."

"But where did you meet Bill?" I asked.

"In the jail. He was brought up with a sharp
turn durin' the retreat, bein' so stuffy that he
kept well in the rear, instead of pushin' ahead as
he might have done."

"Did Macomber succeed in getting into the
prison?"

"He wasn't inside, an' that's a fact; but he
stood at the window, an' kept shoutin' all kinds of
threats till one of the sentries drove him away,
havin' had too much of his yip."

"You saw me quickly enough."

"Well, you see, lad, I had my eye on the window,
countin' to throw my shoe through the glass
when he showed his ugly face again, hopin' that
he'd get cut a bit, an', besides, I somehow had it
in my head that you an' Jerry would flash up
sooner or later."[Pg 339]

"But how did you contrive to come at the
scuttle?" Captain Hanaford asked.

"That was plain sailin'. Bill was one of the
first put into the place, an' knowin' he'd take a
trip to the yard-arm when the Britishers found
out who he was, he naturally took advantage of
the chance to snoop 'round a bit. We had the run
of the whole buildin', seein's there wasn't many of
us, an' when he went in the prisoners didn't number
more'n twenty. He found a key in the door
that led up to the attic, which seemed to be a sort
of store-room, an', thinkin' it might come in
handy if the others didn't know the lay of the
land, he locked the bloomin' place, havin' done
so without bein' seen. When I came he didn't
know anythin' about the scuttle; but we figgered
that if there wasn't one, we could get up stairs
an' pull bricks enough out of the chimney to give
us a hole. There wasn't any need of doin' that,
however, 'cause we found the hatch bolted on the
inside, an' the rest was easy. The only thing
about the whole business which bothers me is,
why the Britishers didn't have a good look around
before turnin' the buildin' into a jail."

"The drubbin' they got at Bladensburg, even
though they did win the battle, confused them,"
my father said with a chuckle of satisfaction.

"It strikes me that we'd better get the pungy
under way mighty soon," Captain Hanaford interrupted.
"It can't be a great while before[Pg 340]
some of the crowd sees the rope we left danglin'
from the chimney, an' then you may set it down
as a fact that this city will be searched in a way
that won't be comfortable for us."

"But where'll you go, Bob?" Bill Jepson
asked. "The British fleet is in the river, an' to
sail up stream strikes me as bein' dangerous, for
they can send light boats after us, an' this draft
won't make much fist of runnin' away from them
in such a breeze as you've got now."

"I had an idee the wind was gettin' up," the
oysterman said as he opened the hatch a few
inches, and at that instant a gust swept into the
cuddy bringing with it a full pail of water.

"A good, nice little thunder squall," the captain
said in a tone of content, "an' if it comes
from the right quarter, we're in luck."

Darius was on deck in a twinkling, and I followed
him, hoping that we might be able to leave
our mooring, for at such a time it would not be a
very difficult matter to get so far up stream as to
baffle pursuit.

At the moment, however, it seemed as if our
good fortune had deserted us. The wind was
drawing down the river with a force that shut
off all hope of sending the pungy against it, and
the rain came in such torrents that the deck was
awash in short order.

"It's a case of stayin' where we are, or takin'
the chances of runnin' down river when you[Pg 341]
couldn't see a nigger under your nose," Darius
said as he and I re-entered the cabin wet to the
skin, although we had not been exposed to the
fury of the tempest above two minutes. "I'm
willin' to run a good many risks; but puttin' this
pungy under sail, with half a dozen frigates somewhere
on the course, is a little too steep for me."

Captain Hanaford was exceeding anxious to be
under way; but he understood that nothing could
be done while the storm raged with such fury,
and we sat in the darkness, discussing what
might be done when the morning came.

It was finally decided that we would take all
the risk of going down stream as soon as the
tempest abated, for there were many creeks along
the shore where we might run under cover to
avoid the fleet, or, if the worst came, we could
go on shore, abandoning the pungy.

In order that Captain Hanaford might be willing
to take the chances of losing his vessel, I
showed him the guarantee we had received from
Commodore Barney, and promised that when
we got the money from the government he should
share equally with us.

"I'm ready to do whatsoever is agreed upon
without askin' you lads to pay for my pungy in
case I lose her," he said stoutly. "There ain't
any certainty I'd been able to keep her if you
hadn't come aboard, for if the Britishers will
burn nigh on to a whole city, they won't stop at[Pg 342]
a few oyster-boats, if there's any fun to be had
in settin' 'em afire. I don't jest hanker, though,
to fool around with a lot of frigates, an' that's a
fact."

"We won't fool with 'em," Darius said decidedly.
"It stands to reason they must be below
Fort Washington, else we'd heard the firin'
when they tried to come past. Now 'twixt here
an' there we should find a creek where a pungy
like this could be hidden."

"I know of a place about eight miles from
here," the captain said thoughtfully, and Bill
Jepson cried cheerfully:

"Then that settles the whole business. We'll
get under way when this 'ere squall is over,
and before daylight be where we can keep out of
sight till the fleet comes up. Once they're this
side of us we shall be in clear water."

But Bill was not calculating on the force of
the "squall." I have seen a good many summer
storms; but never one to equal that on the
night of August twenty-fifth, in the year of grace
1814.

We could hear now and then ashore, even amid
the howling of the wind and the crashing thunder
the rending of wood as houses were unroofed,
and from the terrible uproar which came later we
believed the trees growing near where we lay
were being torn up by the roots, as was really
found to be the case when morning dawned.[Pg 343]

The pungy rocked to and fro as if in the open
bay, straining at her hawsers until it became
necessary to pass extra ones, otherwise she would
have been swept from her moorings.

Those of us who went on deck to do this work
were wetted in an instant as if we had jumped
overboard, and at times it became necessary to
hold fast by the rail, otherwise we would have
been literally blown into the river.

There was no possibility of getting under way
that night, and all hands kept watch in the cuddy
until day broke, when, and not until then, did
the storm abate.

The wind had aided the Britishers in working
havoc. From the deck of the pungy I saw no less
than four houses, the roofs of which had been
torn off, and one negro shanty was in ruins. As
far as we could see the trees were uprooted, and
the river ran so full of wreckage that I wondered
we had not been swamped off hand.

"We'll stay here a few hours longer, I reckon,"
Darius said to me as he pointed toward the fragments
of buildings and trees with which the
river seemed literally to be choked. "If this
pungy struck fair on somethin' like that yonder,
she'd founder for a fact."

The veriest landsman who ever lived would
have understood that it was folly to think of
getting under way just then, and my heart grew
heavy as lead in my breast, for I firmly believed[Pg 344]
that before another hour had passed the enemy
would be out searching for the prisoners who
had escaped, in which case all hands of us stood
a good chance of seeing the interior of that
"stone house."

As we stood on deck, regardless of the possibility
that some of the enemy might come that
way, a man ran down the street toward the
water's edge, waving his arms about and otherwise
acting as if nearly beside himself with joy
or grief.

"What is the matter, friend?" Captain Hanaford
cried at the full strength of his lungs, and
the man made quite a lengthy reply; but all we
could hear of it was this one exclamation:

"The British!"

"Are they comin' this way?" the captain
demanded, screaming until his face was crimson,
and Bill Jepson suddenly dropped out of sight
through the companion-way.

"They've gone!" the man replied, and we
could now hear his words more distinctly because
he was coming nearer each instant.

"Gone where?" Captain Hanaford cried impatiently.
"Can't you tell us what has happened?"

"The British have cleared out bag an' baggage       went
durin' the storm!"

"What?" Darius screamed, and we looked
at each other incredulously, for surely it could[Pg 345]
not be possible that the enemy had evacuated
the city so soon.

"Come on board an' tell us what you know!"
Captain Hanaford cried. "It is of the greatest
importance for us to learn exactly the situation
of affairs."

The stranger did not accept the invitation to
come on board; but he halted within easy
speaking distance and thus told the story, which
seemed incredible:

"Last night the people livin' near the encampment
were warned, on pain of death, to remain
within doors from sunset till sunrise. Those
who were curious enough to look out of the windows
saw that the camp fires had been increased,
an' supposed reinforcements were comin' in;
but this mornin' neither hide nor hair is to be
seen of the red-coats, an' a planter comin' in
from nearabout Long Old Fields, reports that
the soldiers are marchin' in the direction of
Nottingham. An' that ain't all, for the troops
that stayed at Bladensburg after the battle, are
on the way to Upper Marlboro, 'cordin to the
report of an old darkey who came into town not
half an hour ago."

Having thus unfolded his budget of news, the
man hurried on to spread the glad tidings, leaving
us who were aboard the pungy in a state of
mingled bewilderment and joy.

"I can't understand it," Darius said after a[Pg 346]
brief pause, during which we had looked at each
other questioningly. "I'm goin' to take the
chances of findin' out for myself."

The old man went over the rail as he spoke,
and I would have followed, but that he said
sharply:

"Stay where you are, lad. We ain't dead certain
'bout that yarn, an' if it's a case of gettin'
into trouble, it better be one than two who pays
for nosin' 'round a British camp."

Captain Hanaford felt certain the news must
be correct, for our informant had the appearance
of being an honest man, and nothing could have
been gained by spreading such a story.

"We'll cook the best breakfast to be had, by
way of rejoicin'," he said, "an' after that's been
done all hands shall come into a council of war,
to decide if we're to make the venture down the
river."

"If the enemy has really evacuated the city,
it is reasonable to suppose that the fleet will go
back down the bay," I said, thinking myself
very wise in such matters. "It strikes me that
the way home lies open before us."

My companions were of the same opinion, and
a very merry party we were on the oyster pungy
that morning as we tried in vain to guess why
the enemy had left so suddenly, when there
seemed to be nothing to prevent him from taking
possession of all the country round about.[Pg 347]

Before the feast was ready to be eaten Darius
returned, and a single glance at his face was
sufficient to show that the good news was true.

"They've gone, an' there's no mistake about
it," he announced, as he sprang over the rail
lightly as any boy. "I went to the place where
the troops were encamped, before bein' willin'
to believe they'd turned tail so suddenly. Now
I'd like to know if that very friendly gentleman
Elias Macomber, has been left behind, or if he
followed the force? If he's in this city I could
make it mighty interestin' for him."

"Never mind the sneak, Darius!" my father
cried. "There is no need for you to punish him,
because if the British go away he'll find it very
uncomfortable around here, and that's enough
to serve the cur out for all he has done."

Darius did not appear to think that Macomber's
misdeeds could be atoned so easily; but he
kept his opinion to himself, and joined us in what
was at the same time a feast of rejoicing and
thanksgiving.

Not until the meal was come to an end did
we begin the discussion as to how we should get
home, and then Captain Hanaford opened the
question by asking:

"Now, lads, are we to run up stream into
the mud, or take our chances of findin' the British
fleet 'twixt here an' the bay?"

Darius immediately proposed that we strike[Pg 348]
out for the Chesapeake, using the same argument
I had, that since the retreat of the soldiers there
was little chance the vessels would make any
effort at running past Fort Washington.

Bill Jepson, who could not be blamed for
feeling a bit nervous at going any nearer a
British vessel of war than was absolutely necessary,
believed that it would be safer for us to
go back to Benedict by land, keeping at a respectful
distance in the rear of the enemy; but
his plan was not considered, because it would be
impossible for my father to travel on foot, and
I, at least, was not disposed to part company
with him.

We spent a full hour discussing the situation,
and then it had been decided that we would run
boldly down the river, nearly all of us feeling
confident that there were no longer any British
vessels to block our way.

There was nothing to delay us in making the
start as soon as the river should be clear of the
tokens sent by the storm, except Darius' desire
to make systematic search for Elias Macomber;
but to this all of us objected so strongly that,
much against his will, he was forced to give over
the idea.

For my part I had seen enough of the British-lover;
we had captured him twice, which was
our full share of such business, and if we did
spend time hunting him down, providing he[Pg 349]
yet remained in the city, what could we do with
the villain? He had forfeited all rights of
citizenship in our section of the country, and I
had no doubt that wherever he went his sins
would find him out. It was better we leave him
alone, from whatever standpoint I viewed it.

Captain Hanaford decided that the river would
be clear of drift by morning, therefore we were
agreed to set sail then, and, as a means of passing
the time pleasantly, we lads went over to the
"stone house" to see how the old shell-backs
managed to escape so readily.

We found the building open and abandoned.
The enemy had taken the prisoners away, and
we were not hindered in going over it thoroughly.

When that inspection was ended, we viewed
the ruins in the different parts of the city, paid
a visit to the smoke-house, and returned to the
pungy late in the afternoon, well satisfied to
bring our visit to the capital to the earliest possible
close.

On that evening Captain Hanaford brought
aboard a surgeon, who cared for my father's
wound, and, what was better, declared that he
saw no reason why it should not heal speedily,
leaving him none the worse for having received
it.

We were eager to be under way, as may be
supposed, and as soon as the day dawned on the
27th of August, we cast off from the dock, feel[Pg 350]ing
that the good God had been very kind in
permitting us to return to our homes when so
many had been left at Bladensburg to fill soldiers'
graves.

It was as if everything favored us at the start
of the homeward journey. The river was free
from the drift of all kinds which had covered its
surface; the wind was blowing gently from the
north, and the day gave promise of being
clear.

The pungy slipped along as if conscious that
she, like ourselves, had escaped from great
dangers, and was longing for another cargo of
oysters in her hold.

Bill Jepson acted as if he had suddenly lost
his senses. He sang the wildest kind of songs,
danced two or three hornpipes, and then insisted
on Darius joining him, while Jim Freeman
furnished the music by whistling fast and
furiously. As a matter of fact, all of us, even
including my father, were disposed to be exceeding
jolly now that we were homeward bound
with the belief that the enemy was no longer in
a position to annoy us.

We lads talked of the pungy we would buy
when the government paid us for the Avenger,
and laid many a plan for the future when Jim,
his two friends, Jerry, Darius and I would begin
oystering again, in a craft capable of carrying
three or four times the cargo we had been able[Pg 351]
to squeeze into the old boat which had been
sacrificed at Pig Point.

Then, when it was near noon, we had come
within sight of Fort Washington, and as we
rounded the bend Captain Hanaford gave vent
to an exclamation of surprise and fear, which
was echoed by Bill Jepson.

At some considerable distance down the river
it was possible to see the upper spars of seven
vessels of war which were slowly approaching
the fortification from the southward.

"It's the British fleet!" Captain Hanaford
cried as he shoved the tiller hard down, thereby
swinging the pungy's nose into the mud of the
eastern bank. "We were bloomin' fools to think
that the enemy had all run away!"

"It's the fleet under Captain Gordon, an' I
can tell you just how strong it is," Bill Jepson
said as he rubbed his head nervously. "There
are two frigates of thirty-six an' thirty-eight
guns; two rocket ships of eighteen guns each,
two bomb vessels of eight guns each, an' one
schooner carryin' two guns."

"The schooner would be enough to bring us
up with a sharp turn, therefore I hold that it
don't make any difference how many frigates are
behind her," Darius cried. "The question is
whether the fort can prevent their comin' up the
river?"

No one aboard could say what might be done[Pg 352]
by those in the fortification, or how strongly
it was garrisoned; but later I read the following
in one of the newspapers, and will set it down
here so that what happened while we were on
the river may be the better understood.

"The only obstruction to the passage of the
fleet on which the Americans might place the
least reliance, was Fort Washington, on the
Maryland side of the Potomac, about twelve
miles below the national capital. It was a feeble
fortress, but capable of being made strong. So
early as May 1813, a deputation from Alexandria,
Georgetown and Washington waited upon the
Secretary of War, and represented the importance
of strengthening the post.

"An engineer was sent to examine it. He
reported in favor of additional works in the
rear, while he believed that the armament of the
fort, and its elevated situation, would enable a
well-managed garrison to repulse any number
of ships of war which might attempt to pass up
the river. Nothing more was done.

"In July, 1814, when a British fleet and army
were in the Chesapeake, the authorities of
Alexandria again called the attention of the
Secretary of War to the feeble condition of Fort
Washington. The secretary did not believe the
enemy would push for the capital, and nothing
was done. The Alexandrians appealed to
General Winder, who recommended the strength[Pg 353]ening
of the post. Three of the banks in Alexandria
offered to loan the government fifty thousand
dollars for the construction of more defences
for the District. The money was accepted,
but nothing was done to Fort Washington.
When the battle of Bladensburg occurred, and
the seat of government was left to the mercy
of the invaders, Fort Washington was as feebly
armed as ever, and its garrison consisted of only
about eighty men, under Captain Samuel T.
Dyson."



[Pg 354]
CHAPTER XX.

DODGING THE ENEMY.


As I have said, Captain Hanaford shoved his
tiller hard over, throwing the pungy around until
her nose struck the mud, and it was a question
of getting her off the bank in the shortest
possible space of time, unless we were minded to
lay there when the action began, for none of
us doubted but that an engagement was close
at hand.

"It's a case of runnin' back up the river," Bill
Jepson said nervously, "An' the sooner we get
about it the better."

Darius was not of the same opinion, as was
shown when he said, after waiting a moment
to learn if any other had an opinion to express:

"I'm willin' to agree that we're bound to put
back a bit, so's to be out of the way when the
iron begins to fly; but I don't hold that we should
run very far off until findin' out how things are
goin' to turn."

"You might settle that question after the
pungy is afloat," my father said grimly. "Just[Pg 355]
at present we're in a bad place if there's to be
any firing done, and when we're off the mud
you'll have plenty of time in which to discuss the
situation."

"That's about the size of it," Captain Hanaford
added emphatically, and then he ordered
us lads into the small boat that we might pull
the pungy's bow around.

Any one who has ever run an oysterman such
as we have in the Chesapeake, knows that when
a craft of that build takes ground ever so lightly,
it is not a simple matter to float her, especially
when there's no cargo that can be shifted to bring
the stern down and the bow up.

We lads worked our prettiest with the paddles
after making fast to the vessel's nose, and, finding
that we were making no headway, the three
able-bodied men began pushing with poles which
are kept aboard for such purpose, until she slid
slowly into deeper water.

Then it was a case of clawing away from the
fort, which was not easy, since the wind that had
brought us down so finely, now blew directly
in our teeth, and the pungy was a master-hand
for sliding off when you tried to tack.

As a matter of course it was necessary to
stand over toward the opposite shore, which was
not a pleasant piece of business since it carried
us within view of the enemy; but we had no
choice in the matter.[Pg 356]

"If we get back as far as Alexandria by sunset
we'll be doin' mighty well, unless you bring
her around an' try to slide up," Bill Jepson
said grumblingly; but she did not make any
better headway because of his being disgruntled.

"We'll have to take things as they are, matey,"
Darius said grimly. "If the old hooker won't
carry us out of harm's way, we can take to the
shore at any time, which is a bit of consolation
you'd better keep pasted in your hat."

"This breeze will fine down within an hour,"
Captain Hanaford said as if speaking to himself,
"an' then it'll be a case of anchorin', no matter
where we              "

He did not finish the remark, for at that
moment it was as if the earth and sky had come
together with one deafening crash; then followed
three or four reports like unto peals of
thunder near at hand, and those of us who
chanced to be looking astern, saw the fort actually
leap into the air, while from the mass of
earth and stone came a shower of fragments
such as literally obscured the light of the sun for
an instant, after which it fell upon us with a
crash that caused the pungy to rock to and fro
like an egg-shell.

While one might have counted fifty I stood
dazed, unable to understand what had happened,
and bleeding from a dozen scratches caused by
the fall of fragments which absolutely covered[Pg 357]
the deck of the pungy to a depth of two or three
inches. Then I understood that the fort had
been blown up, Captain Dyson believing he could
not hope, with the small force under his command,
to withstand an assault from the fleet.

As we afterward came to know, his instructions
from the War Department were to the
effect that he should destroy the fortification
rather than take the chances of its being captured
by the enemy; but what seemed strange
to me then, and does now, was the fact that he
had not fired a single gun in defiance. Surely he
might have discharged his pieces once, in the hope
of doing a little damage, before setting a match
to the magazine.

Of all our party in the pungy, not one escaped
more or less severe bruises or scratches, and the
wonder is that the vessel was not sent to the
bottom off hand.

However, we were yet afloat, and the river
was open for the passage of the Britishers, therefore
it may be understood that we could not
afford to spend many minutes in speculations
upon what might or might not have been done.

Within three minutes from the time of the explosion,
Darius and Bill Jepson were in the small
boat making fast to the bow of the pungy, and
when Captain Hanaford shouted to ask what they
counted on doing, the old sailor replied:

"There's a creek half a mile further up stream,
[Pg 358]an' if you can get any headway on this apple-bowed
lugger, we may be able to hide before the
Britishers come in sight."

It was absolutely certain that we could not
hope to escape by sailing, because any four-oared
boat in the British fleet would have overtaken
us in a twinkling, therefore, unless it might be
possible to hide, we were in a bad scrape, from
which I saw no relief save at the expense of
abandoning the pungy.

How we worked to push the vessel through
the water! Darius and Bill plied the paddles
with every ounce of strength in their bodies, while
we on deck trimmed the sails to a nicety, shifted
everything movable to bring her into better
trim for sailing, and even swung the two long
sweeps outboard.

We five lads manned the enormous oars with
which the pungy was provided to help her around,
or when she drifted too near inshore, and I
dare venture to say that we did quite as much
toward forcing the craft ahead as the two old
shell-backs did by towing.

Fortunately for us, the Britishers did not
appear to think it necessary to move up the
river swiftly, knowing full well that all the
towns above were at their mercy whenever they
arrived; but the fleet hove to off the ruins of the
fortification while some of the officers landed to
ascertain the amount of damage done. It was
[Pg 359]this last which gave us the opportunity of which
we stood so sorely in need, otherwise we were
taken prisoners beyond a peradventure.

By dint of pulling and paddling we contrived
to get the pungy into the creek of which Darius
had spoken, before the enemy came in sight
again, and then it was a case of hauling her so
far inland that she would be hidden from view
by the foliage.

It can well be supposed that we did not waste
any time at this last work; the perspiration was
running down our faces in tiny streams when
the craft was finally as far up the narrow water-way
as she could be taken, and then all hands
were so exhausted that we threw ourselves on
the deck to regain breath and strength.

All the while that we had been in strenuous
flight my father stood at the helm, thus giving
Captain Hanaford the chance to aid us, otherwise
the task would not have been accomplished
so quickly.

But even when we were thus snug, unless,
perchance, the Britishers took it into their heads
to search the river banks, our work was by no
means done.

It was now necessary that we should know if
the enemy went up stream, and after we had
rested no more than five minutes, when a full
hour would have been hardly enough to put me
in proper trim again, Darius said:[Pg 360]

"Come, Amos, you an' I will stand the first
watch. Bill an' Jerry can spell us in a couple
of hours."

"What do you count on watching?" I asked
curtly.

"The Britishers, of course. We'll paddle
down to the river, an' lay there till the fleet
goes one way or the other."

It would have been a long watch had we remained
on duty until the entire fleet sailed in
one direction; but as to that we were happily
ignorant, and I took my place in the canoe believing
the enemy would sail past our hiding
place in a very short time.

We allowed the canoe to drift down the creek
until we were come within a few yards of the
river, and then, well hidden by the undergrowth,
we made ourselves as comfortable as possible
where we could command a full view of the
channel.

"It doesn't appear to be as easy to get back
home as we counted on," I said, by way of starting
a conversation, and Darius replied confidently:

"This 'ere stop won't put us back very much,
though it'll make a power of extra work, for
I count to be slippin' down river within a couple
of hours at the longest."

Then the old man fell silent, and I was not
disposed to wag my tongue, because of looking[Pg 361]
ahead to the meeting with mother and the children,
which now seemed so near at hand.

We had been on watch an hour or more when
the enemy appeared. The schooner was leading
the way slowly, being towed by boats, with the
men taking soundings every fifteen or twenty
yards in order to show the channel to the two
frigates close astern, and another hour went by
before the three vessels had passed our hiding-place.

Then we watched eagerly, expecting to see the
rocket-ships and bomb-vessels appear; but they
did not heave in sight, although it seemed to
me as if they should have been close behind the
larger ships in order to take advantage of the
labor being performed by those on board the
schooner.

When half an hour had passed, and the river,
so far as we could see in either direction, was free
from craft of any kind, Darius bestowed a resounding
slap upon his leg as he cried angrily:

"What an old fool I am, to be sure! In two
years more, if I keep on runnin' down hill, I
won't be able to tell my own nose from somebody's
else, even when it's pulled."

"What's the matter now?" I asked in surprise.

"What's the matter, lad? Can't you see
that only part of the fleet is goin' up stream?
If the other ships counted on leavin' anchorage
they'd been in the wake of the frigates. We're[Pg 362]
shut in here between two ends of the British
force, an' likely to stay quite a spell."

There could be no question but that he was
right, and I sat staring at him like a stupid,
the dreams in which I had been indulging disappearing
like mist before the morning sun. Of
a verity mother and the children were further
from me than when we had crouched in the
smoke-house at Washington with General Ross'
army close at hand.

"What can we do?" I asked at length.

"That's a question easier asked than answered,"
the old man replied as if he had come
to an end of his ideas. "While your father is
wounded beyond the power of walkin', we're
anchored to the pungy, so to speak."

"What would you do if he was in good
shape?"

"It couldn't be such a terrible tough voyage
to strike across the country from here to Benedict,
leavin' the pungy in the creek till the
Britishers get tired of foolin' around in the
Potomac; but it's no use to spend breath on what
can't be done. Our crew will hang together,
whatever comes. Let's go an' report; it won't
do us any good to stay here."

We paddled slowly back to our comrades, and
when we had told them the situation of affairs
they were in as much of a muddle as had been
Darius and I.[Pg 363]

"There's no tellin' how long the frigates will
stay 'round Washington," Captain Hanaford
said, and then, as a sudden thought came to him,
he added, "I'm gettin' the best of this scrape,
I reckon. If the pungy was where you lads
found her, she'd fare badly when the bloomin'
Englishmen get where they can make mischief."

"I'll stay here and keep ship, while the rest
of you walk across lots to Benedict," my father
suggested; but Darius refused to hear any such
proposition, declaring as he had when we were
in the canoe, that our party should hang together
to the last.

"So far as bodily harm is concerned, we're
safe here till the cows come home," the old man
said thoughtfully, "an' that oughter make us
feel reasonably good, seein's how, one spell, it
looked a deal like bein' killed, or stayin' in a
British prison-ship. We're a mighty poor crowd
if we can't manage to lay still a week or two."

It did really seem as if we had reason to be
ashamed of grumbling when matters had been
so much worse, and I mentally resolved that
I would make the best of the situation, even
though we were forced to remain in hiding a full
month.

My father did his best at cheering us by saying,
and with a deal of reason in his speech, that
the enemy would not dare remain shut up in
the river very long, lest the American fleet come[Pg 364]
to the mouth of the river and blockade him, or
with a superior force, force him to surrender.

"It's Captain Gordon of the Sea Horse, who
is in command," Bill Jepson said, "an' you can
count that he won't be caught nappin'."

"Then we can reckon on bein' free to leave
this creek within three or four days at the outside,
and after that it'll be a question of dodging
the Britishers into Chesapeake bay, which
shouldn't be a hard task."

Taking this view of the matter, and knowing
we had provisions in plenty, all hands began
to look at affairs in a more cheerful light, with
the result that ours was soon a jolly party, with
but one aim, which was to make the time pass
as pleasantly as possible.

During the remainder of that day we talked
of all that had occurred since Commodore Barney
left Pig Point, and speculated upon the result
of an attack upon Baltimore.

That night we turned in without standing
watch, and next morning came a light, drizzling
rain which forced us to keep under cover unless
we were willing to toddle around on the wet
decks, which was not particularly cheerful amusement.

By three o'clock in the afternoon we had talked
until our tongues were tired, and every topic of
conversation was exhausted. Then we fell silent,
with none too pleasing thoughts for company,[Pg 365]
until Darius sprang to his feet with an exclamation
that aroused us all.

"What bloomin' idjuts we are to think we
must needs wait here till the Britishers come
down the river!" he cried excitedly.

"I thought it was settled that we couldn't well
do anything else," Captain Hanaford said in
mild surprise.

"So it was; but the sun was shinin', with every
prospect of a fair night."

I looked at the old sailor in bewilderment. It
seemed as if he had suddenly taken leave of
his senses, for there was nothing to be made of
his words.

"What's crawlin' over you, Darius?" Captain
Hanaford asked. "Has anythin' happened
suddenly?"

"Yes, an' that's a fact! Here we are lyin' up
here in a nasty storm as if we was bound to
stay, when it's only a case of haulin' the pungy
into the channel, an' lettin' her drift past the
vessels below the fort. I'll wager an apple
against a doughnut that we'll go by slick as
fallin' down hill, 'cause it'll be darker 'n Sam
Hill to-night; there ain't any moon to break the
blackness, an' unless we come plump on to the
enemy, they'll never be any the wiser."

I could see that the older members of the
party believed as did Darius; but to me it seemed
like taking needless chances, when by remaining[Pg 366]
in hiding a few days we might set sail without
hindrance, for if our pungy was seen, there
could be little doubt but that she would be sunk
off hand.

However, it was not for me to start any argument
with my elders who understood such matters
far better than did either of us lads, and
I held my peace, expecting that an argument
would ensue.

To my great surprise no further word was
spoken regarding the plan; but Captain Hanaford
pulled on his oiled-coat as he said curtly:

"It'll be a good two-hours' job to pull the
pungy into the stream, an' won't be handy work
after dark."

Darius and Bill made ready to accompany him
on deck, and, to my great surprise, I found that
these three, at least, believed the plan of trying
to drift past the British ships in the darkness
one which should be carried into effect.

I looked at my father; but he appeared to think
all was as it should be, and for the moment I
was dumfounded at the idea of taking so many
and such great chances simply to save idling a
few days.

When the men went on deck we lads followed,
as a matter of course; but never one of us was
called upon to perform any part in the labor.

The creek was too narrow to admit of turning
the pungy, therefore it became necessary to tow[Pg 367]
her out stern first, and this the three men did
quite handily, with Darius and Bill Jepson in
the boat, and Captain Hanaford on deck, to keep
the branches of the trees from fouling with the
rigging.

Half an hour before sunset the little vessel
was at the mouth of the water-way where she
could be put into the stream with but a small
amount of labor, and Captain Hanaford ordered
Jim Freeman and Dody Wardwell to turn to
at getting supper.

While the meal was being prepared the captain
and the two old sailors talked about the probable
location of the enemy's ships, and when the
conversation was come to an end I learned that
they counted on letting the pungy take her own
course, after rounding the point on which the
fort had been located.

It was to be a piece of blind luck all the way
through, and I made up my mind that if the
vessel was afloat after we passed the ships, it
would be a sure case of interposition of that
divinity which watches over fools.

I seemed to be the only one, however, who was
borrowing any trouble on account of the proposed
venture, and it can well be fancied that
I held my peace, although I did a power of thinking.

When supper had been eaten, and the last
spark of fire in the cook-stove extinguished lest[Pg 368]
it should be seen by the enemy, all hands went
on deck.

Of a verity the night was black enough, if
that was the only thing wanted to insure success.
Standing at the tiller I could not even make out
the loom of the mainmast, and as for saying
whether the pungy was in the stream or the river,
it was impossible.

Darius and Bill Jepson went about their
portion of the task, however, as if it was broad
day.

The pungy was pulled out into the current,
the old sailors came over the rail, and we were
fully committed to the venture.

I had supposed that some portion of the sails
would be spread to give us steerage-way if
nothing more; but in this I was mistaken. A
square of white canvas could be more readily
seen in the darkness than the entire hull of the
pungy, which was painted black, therefore we
would go through with only the empty spars to
give an alarm, if so be the enemy caught a
glimpse of us.

We had hardly more than started when the
rain began to fall heavily, and Bill Jepson said
with a chuckle of satisfaction:

"Everythin' is workin' our way. There ain't
a barnacle aboard the ships that'll stand up an'
take all this water when he can keep himself
dry by seekin' the shelter of the rail."[Pg 369]

"But suppose we run plump on to them?" I
asked in a whisper.

"Then it'll be a case of doin' some tall an'
lively hustlin', lad, an' no man can say what
ought'er be done till we're in the scrape."

"Can you make out the shore on either side?"
I asked.

"Yes, by stoopin' low so's to sight the sky over
the tree-tops, you can contrive to get an idee of
whether we're in the middle of the stream; but
you can't do much more."

"I might stand on my head without being able
to tell which was land and which water."

"I reckon that's true," Bill said with a laugh;
"but when you've knocked around at sea as
long as I have, you'll learn to see through ink,
bottle an' all."

"Stop that noise!" Darius whispered harshly.
"You're not even to breathe loud from this out,
an' walkin' across the deck will make trouble
with me for the man or lad who does it."

Thus it was that each fellow felt obliged to
remain wherever he stood when the order had
been given. We could well understand the reason
for such caution, and were not disposed to go
contrary to the command.

I peered into the gloom intently, hoping I
might distinguish the shadows of the trees
ashore; but it was impossible, and from that
moment I remained with my eyes shut, as one
[Pg 370]involuntarily does when the blackness is intense.

How slowly the time passed! I tried to get
some idea of the minutes by counting up to sixty,
allowing that number of seconds had gone by;
but failed in so doing because my anxiety was
so great that I did not keep the reckoning.

It seemed as if an hour had fled, although the
current should have carried us among the fleet
in less than half that time, when I was startled
by hearing a voice close by my side, apparently.

"It's a bloomin' nasty night, matey."

"Right you are," was the reply. "It's jest
my luck to be muckin' 'round here when the lads
from the other ships are havin' high jinks in one
of the Yankee cities."

Then it was that I realized we were within a
few yards of a ship, and by some stroke of good
fortune had missed fowling her.

It surely seemed as if they must see us, although
I could not make out even a shadow of
her, strain my eyes as I might, and in case we
were discovered, the end would come very
rapidly, as I then believed.

From that moment it was as if I did not
breathe, so fearful was I of giving some alarm
which would betray our whereabouts.

The pattering of the rain on the water raised
no slight noise, and this was favorable to us.
Our tiller had been lashed, so that there might
[Pg 371]be no possibility the rudder-head would creak
in its socket, and every rope was brailed to guard
against its flapping.

Had ours been the ghost of a ship and those
on board a phantom crew, we could not have
glided down stream more silently; but the danger
which had been ever present in my thoughts was
that of coming in collision with one of the ships.

We had already passed the first in safety; but
there were three others, and in fear and trembling
I admitted to myself that we could not hope
to slip by them all.



[Pg 372]
CHAPTER XXI.

IN PORT.


The moments passed in silence, save for the
hissing of the rain-drops as they mingled with
the water of the river, and I was saying to myself
that of a verity we must have drifted safely
through the fleet without touching a ship, when
that came which I had been fearing.

Suddenly I felt a shock; then a noise as of
wood grinding against wood, and I knew we
had fouled the enemy!

While one might have counted five the pungy
rubbed against the side of the ship, and then
came the hail:

"Ahoy there! Ahoy!"

"What are you hailing?" a strange voice cried,
and he who had first broken the silence replied:

"There's a craft of some kind alongside, sir!"

Then it was as if a swarm of bees had been let
loose. The enemy's ship was alive with moving,
buzzing beings, some of whom cried out this or
that order, and others called down maledictions
on the head of the man who had needlessly
aroused them.
[Pg 373]
"There's nothin' here, sir. Sam was
dreamin'," I heard the voice of a sailor cry, and
almost at the same instant came the rattling of
fire-arms as they were being handled, sounding
so near aboard that it seemed as if a portion of
the enemy had leaped upon our decks.

"Make ready! Fire!" sounded the command,
sharp and quick.

Then came a sheet of flame which lighted up
surrounding objects until we could distinctly
see the deck of the bomb-vessel, and the eager
men thronging her deck.

This illumination was but as the lightning's
flash, and then we could hear the angry hum of
the bullets as they swarmed above our heads.

We had been seen, and I believed that a broadside
would follow in short order, yet at the same
time I realized that our good fortune had followed
us when it sent the pungy afoul of a bomb-vessel,
instead of a craft which had her guns
ready trained for service.

Now had come the time, however, when we
were to remain idle no longer.

I heard Darius call Bill Jepson, and knew by
the noises which followed that the two sailors
were taking to the canoe in order to tow the
pungy, and at the same time Captain Hanaford
cast off the lashing of the tiller as he ordered us
to run up the canvas.

Work? I have never moved so lively before
[Pg 374]nor since, as I did then when I felt positive that
within a very few seconds our deck would be
swept by grape and cannister.

At such moments of supreme danger one's
senses are unnaturally acute, and while I gave
strict attention to all that was taking place
aboard the pungy, it became possible to understand
what the enemy was about.

The other vessels of the fleet were making
ready to take a hand in our destruction. From
every quarter we could hear cries of command,
mingled with the noise of men running to and fro,
and just when the pungy began to feel the effect
of the canvas which was clapped on her in such a
hurry, a rocket went up, illumining the scene
for ten seconds or more.

Then it was I saw that we had passed three
of the ships, having come to grief on the last in
the line, and had no time to take further note of
the surroundings when the guns of all four craft
belched forth with a mighty roar that caused
the pungy to tremble, but the impact of the shot
did not follow.

Thus suddenly aroused, and in the intense
darkness which had been dispelled only long
enough to dazzle a fellow's eyes, the gunners had
not been able to take accurate aim, otherwise we
must have gone to the bottom like a stone.

"They won't have time to try that game more
than once again before we'll be well out of their[Pg 375]
way," I heard Darius say, and I knew we had
sufficient speed to render useless the work of
towing, otherwise the two sailors would not have
come aboard.

Now three rockets were sent up in rapid succession,
and while the light lasted I knew that the
British gunners were taking aim at us; but we
had slipped so far down the river by this time
that there were some few chances in our favor,
however closely they might shoot.

"Down on your faces!" Darius cried, and I
dropped like a stone, understanding that such an
order had been given to lessen the chances of
our being hit; but at the same time the thought
came to me that it was better to be killed by a
round-shot which would cut a man's life short
instantly, than mangled by a splinter.

Then came the flash of burning powder; the
mighty roar of big guns; the hurtling shot striking
the water on every side, and the pungy reeled
and quivered as if she had struck a rock.

"One ball went home that time!" Darius
cried, and I knew by the sound that he had leaped
to his feet, running with all speed into the
cuddy.

From below I made out the tiny gleam of
the match as Darius lighted a lantern, and did
not need to be told that he was gone to learn
what injury our vessel had received.

Immediately the cannon had been discharged[Pg 376]
Captain Hanaford was on his feet, grasping the
tiller as if it was possible to steer the pungy while
the blackness continued so dense that one might
fancy he could feel it, and then came the glare
of more rockets.

This aided the helmsman of ours more than
it did the British gunners, since it gave him an
opportunity to see exactly where his vessel was;
but as to that I gave no heed. All my mind was
centered on the distance between us and the
enemy.

I could have cried aloud with joy, and am not
certain but that I did, on seeing that we were
drawing away with more speed than I had believed
was in the clumsy craft, and, what was of
greater importance, the pungy was rounding a
bend which, once passed, would put us beyond
reach of the guns.

The rockets had been fired just in the nick of
time, otherwise we would have gone ashore on
the western bank.

For the third time we heard the thunder of
the guns; but the shot must have passed astern
of us, for I did not hear either the splashing of
water or the splintering of our wood-work to
tell where they struck.

Then Darius came on deck with an announcement
that relieved me of nearly all my fears.

"The pungy has a solid shot above the water-line
well forward; but there's no need of pluggin'[Pg 377]
it, for the ball didn't get through the timber. I
reckon we've done the trick, eh, captain?"

"We're off for a fact, an' unless we strike the
mud 'twixt here an' the bay, we've seen the last
of that lot of Britishers."

Now it was that all hands of us were ordered
forward to act as look-outs, and the pungy danced
along in the darkness, as if rejoicing at her escape
from a peril that had well-nigh proved her ending.

It is impossible for me to set down what we
said or did when it was seen that we had really
escaped from as dangerous a venture as human
beings ever embarked in. I dare say we acted
like a party of simples, and certain it is that the
older members of the crew were no less boisterous
in their rejoicings than we lads.

And now there remains but little more to be
said, for the homeward voyage was short.

At midnight the rain ceased falling; the clouds
were partially dispersed, and we had sufficient
light to enable us to navigate the little vessel
without difficulty.

In four and twenty hours, without having come
across an enemy, or anything to cause alarm,
we were in Benedict once more, Captain Hanaford
having sailed past his own home in order
to land us, and well was it for all hands that we
did not arrive the day previous, because not until
then did the fleet under Admiral Cochrane, with
[Pg 378]the land forces under General Ross, take their
final departure, leaving the little village looking
as if a herd of cattle had been pastured there.

It only remains for me to say, since this story
has nothing to do with my movements after we
were returned from service under Commodore
Barney, that in due time the government honored
the commodore's guarantee, thus enabling Jerry
and me to purchase a pungy much larger and
better than the Avenger, and at the same time
have quite a substantial sum of money to give
our parents.

And all this I have written in the cuddy of
the new boat, which we have named the "Joshua
Barney," while Jim Freeman, Dody Wardwell,
Josiah Coburn, Darius and Jerry have discussed
each portion as it was set down, for we are shipmates
in the oyster business, sharing the profits
as well as the work, until a stranger would find
it difficult to say which is the captain or which
the cook.

Now that my portion of the work has come to
an end, I shall copy here that which will serve
to wind up the yarn in proper shape.

Referring to the close of the battle of Bladensburg,
a newspaper writer says:

"The English sharp-shooters had straggled
about, and were doing much mischief; Barney's
horse fell between two of the guns, pierced by[Pg 379]
two balls; several of his officers were killed or
wounded, the ammunition wagon had gone off
in the general confusion and retreat of the army;
the enemy began to flank out to the right, under
cover of a thick wood, and had nearly surrounded
the commodore. His men were nearly exhausted,
having undergone a three-days' march without a
regular supply of provisions. He had received
a wound in the thigh some time before, and was
faint from loss of blood, when he ordered a
retreat, which was effected in good order by the
men and such officers as could follow. He retired
a few yards with the help of three of his
officers whom he had ordered away, and fell from
weakness, in which situation he was found by the
enemy.

"General Ross and Admiral Cockburn came
to him and tendered every assistance. He was
carried in a litter to the village of Bladensburg,
and the next day, in the company of his wife
and son, was taken home in a carriage. A week
later he was formally exchanged for two British
colonels. The ball had been probed for by the
English surgeons, but without effect, and it was
not found until after his death, which is said to
have been caused by the wound."

And now regarding the fleet which we dodged,
Mr. Lossing says in his "War of 1812."

"The British squadron appeared before Fort[Pg 380]
Washington on the 27th of August, three days
after the capture of the capital. Captain Dyson
either misunderstood General Winder's order,
or was influenced by mortal fear, for he blew
up and abandoned the fort without firing a gun.
No doubt the British fleet could have been kept
below by the heavy cannon of the fort. Dyson
chose not to try the experiment, and for his injurious
conduct he was dismissed from the service.

"The British squadron now had nothing to
fear, and without interference the frigates sailed
on, anchoring off Alexandria on the evening of
the 28th. On the morning of the 29th it assumed
a hostile attitude a hundred yards from the
wharves, and was well prepared to lay every
building in the town in ashes. The citizens sent
a deputation to Captain Gordon to ask upon
what terms he would consent to spare the town.
He replied that all naval stores and ordnance;
all the shipping and its furniture; merchandise
of every description in the city, or which had been
carried out of it to a place of safety; and refreshments
of every kind, must be immediately
given up to him. Also that the vessels which had
been scuttled to save them from destruction must
be raised, and delivered up to him. 'Do all this,'
he said, 'and the town of Alexandria, with the
exception of public works, shall be spared, and
the inhabitants shall remain unmolested."[Pg 381]

"These were harsh and humiliating terms, and
the inhabitants were allowed only one hour for
consideration. They were powerless, and were
compelled to submit. The merchandise that had
been carried from the town and the sunken
vessels could not be given up to the invader, so
he contented himself by burning one vessel and
loading several others, chiefly with flour, cotton
and tobacco. With these in charge, the squadron
weighed anchor and sailed down the Potomac."

THE END.



[Pg 383]
Good Fiction Worth Reading.

A series of romances containing several of the old favorites in the field
of historical fiction, replete with powerful romances of love and diplomacy
that excel in thrilling and absorbing interest.



A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE. A story of American Colonial Times, By
Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.

A book that appeals to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary
scenes. The story is a strong one, a thrilling one. It causes the true
American to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter, until
the eyes smart, and it fairly smokes with patriotism. The love story is a
singularly charming idyl.

THE TOWER OF LONDON. A Historical Romance of the Times of Lady
Jane Grey and Mary Tudor. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with
four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.

This romance of the "Tower of London" depicts the Tower as palace,
prison and fortress, with many historical associations. The era is the
middle of the sixteenth century.

The story is divided into two parts, one dealing with Lady Jane Grey,
and the other with Mary Tudor as Queen, introducing other notable characters
of the era. Throughout the story holds the interest of the reader
in the midst of intrigue and conspiracy, extending considerably over a
half a century.

IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING. A Romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.

Mr. Hotchkiss has etched in burning words a story of Yankee bravery,
and true love that thrills from beginning to end, with the spirit of the
Revolution. The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking a
part in the exciting scenes described. His whole story is so absorbing
that you will sit up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance
it is charming.

GARTHOWEN. A story of a Welsh Homestead. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.

"This is a little idyl of humble life and enduring love, laid bare before
us, very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of
Welsh character       the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath....
We call this a well-written story, interesting alike through its
romance and its glimpses into another life than ours. A delightful and
clever picture of Welsh village life. The result is excellent."       Detroit Free
Press.

MIFANWY. The story of a Welsh Singer. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.

"This is a love story, simple, tender and pretty as one would care to
read. The action throughout is brisk and pleasing; the characters, it is apparent
at once, are as true to life as though the author had known them
all personally. Simple in all its situations, the story is worked up in that
touching and quaint strain which never grows wearisome, no matter how
often the lights and shadows of love are introduced. It rings true, and
does not tax the imagination."       Boston Herald.

[Pg 384]

DARNLEY, A Romance of the times of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey.
By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis.
Price, $1.00.

In point of publication, "Darnley" is that work by Mr. James which
follows "Richelieu," and, if rumor can be credited, it was owing to the advice
and insistence of our own Washington Irving that we are indebted
primarily for the story, the young author questioning whether he could
properly paint the difference in the characters of the two great cardinals.
And it is not surprising that James should have hesitated; he had been
eminently successful in giving to the world the portrait of Richelieu as a
man, and by attempting a similar task with Wolsey as the theme, was
much like tempting fortune. Irving insisted that "Darnley" came naturally
in sequence, and this opinion being supported by Sir Walter Scott,
the author set about the work.

As a historical romance "Darnley" is a book that can be taken up
pleasurably again and again, for there is about it that subtle charm which
those who are strangers to the works of G. P. R. James have claimed was
only to be imparted by Dumas.

If there was nothing more about the work to attract especial attention,
the account of the meeting of the kings on the historic "field of the cloth of
gold" would entitle the story to the most favorable consideration of every
reader.

There is really but little pure romance in this story, for the author has
taken care to imagine love passages only between those whom history has
credited with having entertained the tender passion one for another, and
he succeeds in making such lovers as all the world must love.

CAPTAIN BRAND, OF THE SCHOONER CENTIPEDE. By Lieut.
Henry A. Wise, U. S. N. (Harry Gringo). Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.

The re-publication of this story will please those lovers of sea yarns
who delight in so much of the salty flavor of the ocean as can come through
the medium of a printed page, for never has a story of the sea and those
"who go down in ships" been written by one more familiar with the scenes
depicted.

The one book of this gifted author which is best remembered, and which
will be read with pleasure for many years to come, is "Captain Brand,"
who, as the author states on his title page, was a "pirate of eminence in
the West Indies." As a sea story pure and simple, "Captain Brand" has
never been excelled, and as a story of piratical life, told without the usual
embellishments of blood and thunder, it has no equal.

NICK OF THE WOODS. A story of the Early Settlers of Kentucky. By
Robert Montgomery Bird. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.

This most popular novel and thrilling story of early frontier life in
Kentucky was originally published in the year 1837. The novel, long out of
print, had in its day a phenomenal sale, for its realistic presentation of
Indian and frontier life in the early days of settlement in the South, narrated
in the tale with all the art of a practiced writer. A very charming
love romance runs through the story. This new and tasteful edition of
"Nick of the Woods" will be certain to make many new admirers for
this enchanting story from Dr. Bird's clever and versatile pen.



[Pg 385]GUY FAWKES. A Romance of the Gunpowder Treason. By Wm. Harrison
Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.

The "Gunpowder Plot" was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.

THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER. A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.

A book rather out of the ordinary is this "Spirit of the Border." The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.

Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian "Village
of Peace" are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.

By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.

It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.

RICHELIEU. A tale of France in the reign of King Louis XIII. By G. P.
R. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.

In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, "Richelieu," and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.

In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal's
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar's conspiracy;
the method of conducting criminal cases, and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites, affording a better insight into the statecraft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.
[Pg 386]


WINDSOR CASTLE. A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII.,
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.

"Windsor Castle" is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. "Bluff King Hal," although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King's love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.

HORSESHOE ROBINSON. A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.

Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction,
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.

The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.

Take it all in all, "Horseshoe Robinson" is a work which should be
found on every book-shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.

THE PEARL OF ORR'S ISLAND. A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00.

Written prior to 1862, the "Pearl of Orr's Island" is ever new; a book
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the "sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr's Island," and straightway
comes "the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal."

Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel's wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother's breast.

There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
which Mrs. Stowe gives in "The Pearl of Orr's Island."

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
