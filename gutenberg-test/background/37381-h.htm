<h2>Snowdrop</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was the middle of winter, and the snowflakes were falling
from the sky like feathers. Now, a Queen sat sewing
at a window framed in black ebony, and as she sewed
she looked out upon the snow. Suddenly she pricked her
finger and three drops of blood fell on to the snow. And the
red looked so lovely on the white that she thought to herself:
&lsquo;If only I had a child as white as snow and as red as blood,
and as black as the wood of the window frame!&rsquo; Soon after,
she had a daughter, whose hair was black as ebony, while her
cheeks were red as blood, and her skin as white as snow; so
she was called Snowdrop. But when the child was born the
Queen died. A year after the King took another wife. She
was a handsome woman, but proud and overbearing, and could
not endure that any one should surpass her in beauty. She
had a magic looking-glass, and when she stood before it and
looked at herself she used to say:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Mirror, Mirror on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest of us all?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>then the Glass answered,</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Queen, thou&rsquo;rt fairest of them all.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then she was content, for she knew that the Looking-glass
spoke the truth.</p>

<p>But Snowdrop grew up and became more and more beautiful,
so that when she was seven years old she was as beautiful
as the day, and far surpassed the Queen. Once, when she
asked her Glass,</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Mirror, Mirror on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest of us all?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>it answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Queen, thou art fairest here, I hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Snowdrop is fairer a thousandfold.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the Queen was horror-struck, and turned green and
yellow with jealousy. From the hour that she saw Snowdrop
her heart sank, and she hated
the little girl.</p>

alt="The queen looks into the mirror" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&lsquo;Mirror, Mirror on the wall,<br />
Who is fairest of us all?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The pride and envy of her
heart grew like a weed, so
that she had no rest day nor
night. At last she called a
Huntsman, and said: &lsquo;Take
the child out into the wood;
I will not set eyes on her
again; you must kill her and
bring me her lungs and liver
as tokens.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman obeyed,
and took Snowdrop out into
the forest, but when he drew
his hunting-knife and was
preparing to plunge it into
her innocent heart, she began
to cry:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas! dear Huntsman,
spare my life, and I will run
away into the wild forest and
never come back again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And because of her beauty
the Huntsman had pity on
her and said, &lsquo;Well, run
away, poor child.&rsquo; Wild
beasts will soon devour you, he thought, but still he felt as
though a weight were lifted from his heart because he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
not been obliged to kill her. And as just at that moment
a young fawn came leaping by, he pierced it and took the
lungs and liver as tokens to the Queen. The Cook was ordered
to serve them up in pickle, and the wicked Queen ate them
thinking that they were Snowdrop&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Now the poor child was alone in the great wood, with no
living soul near, and she was so frightened that she knew not
what to do. Then she began to run, and ran over the sharp
stones and through the brambles, while the animals passed
her by without harming her. She ran as far as her feet could
carry her till it was nearly evening, when she saw a little house
and went in to rest. Inside, everything was small, but as
neat and clean as could be. A small table covered with a
white cloth stood ready with seven small plates, and by every
plate was a spoon, knife, fork, and cup. Seven little beds
were ranged against the walls, covered with snow-white
coverlets. As Snowdrop was very hungry and thirsty she
ate a little bread and vegetable from each plate, and drank a
little wine from each cup, for she did not want to eat up the
whole of one portion. Then, being very tired, she lay down
in one of the beds. She tried them all but none suited her;
one was too short, another too long, all except the seventh,
which was just right. She remained in it, said her prayers,
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>When it was quite dark the masters of the house came in.
They were seven Dwarfs, who used to dig in the mountains for
ore. They kindled their lights, and as soon as they could see
they noticed that some one had been there, for everything
was not in the order in which they had left it.</p>

<p>The first said, &lsquo;Who has been sitting in my chair?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The second said, &lsquo;Who has been eating off my plate?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The third said, &lsquo;Who has been nibbling my bread?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The fourth said, &lsquo;Who has been eating my vegetables?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The fifth said, &lsquo;Who has been using my fork?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The sixth said, &lsquo;Who has been cutting with my knife?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The seventh said, &lsquo;Who has been drinking out of my cup?&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">In the evening the seven Dwarfs came back.</p>

<p>Then the first looked and saw a slight impression on his
bed, and said, &lsquo;Who has been treading on my bed?&rsquo; The
others came running up and said, &lsquo;And mine, and mine.&rsquo;
But the seventh, when he looked into his bed, saw Snowdrop,
who lay there asleep. He called the others, who came up and
cried out with astonishment, as they held their lights and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
gazed at Snowdrop. &lsquo;Heavens! what a beautiful child,&rsquo;
they said, and they were so delighted that they did not wake
her up but left her asleep in bed. And the seventh Dwarf
slept with his comrades, an hour with each all through the
night.</p>

<p>When morning came Snowdrop woke up, and when she saw
the seven Dwarfs she was frightened.</p>

<p>But they were very kind and asked her name.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am called Snowdrop,&rsquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How did you get into our house?&rsquo; they asked.</p>

<p>Then she told them how her stepmother had wished to get
rid of her, how the Huntsman had spared her life, and how
she had run all day till she had found the house.</p>

<p>Then the Dwarfs said, &lsquo;Will you look after our household,
cook, make the beds, wash, sew and knit, and keep everything
neat and clean? If so you shall stay with us and want for
nothing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Snowdrop, &lsquo;with all my heart&rsquo;; and she
stayed with them and kept the house in order.</p>

<p>In the morning they went to the mountain and searched
for copper and gold, and in the evening they came back and
then their meal had to be ready. All day the maiden was
alone, and the good Dwarfs warned her and said, &lsquo;Beware of
your stepmother, who will soon learn that you are here. Don&rsquo;t
let any one in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Queen, having, as she imagined, eaten Snowdrop&rsquo;s
liver and lungs, and feeling certain that she was the fairest of
all, stepped in front of her Glass, and asked&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Mirror, Mirror on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest of us all?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the Glass answered as usual&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Queen, thou art fairest here, I hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Snowdrop over the fells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with the seven Dwarfs dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fairer still a thousandfold.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
She was dismayed, for she knew that the Glass told no lies,
and she saw that the Hunter had deceived her and that
Snowdrop still lived. Accordingly she began to wonder
afresh how she might compass her death; for as long as she
was not the fairest in the land her jealous heart left her no
rest. At last she thought of a plan. She dyed her face and
dressed up like an old Pedlar, so that she was quite unrecognisable.
In this guise she crossed over the seven mountains to
the home of the seven Dwarfs and called out, &lsquo;Wares for sale.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Snowdrop peeped out of the window and said, &lsquo;Good-day,
mother, what have you got to sell?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good wares, fine wares,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;laces of every
colour&rsquo;; and she held out one which was made of gay plaited
silk.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I may let the honest woman in,&rsquo; thought Snowdrop, and
she unbolted the door and bought the pretty lace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Child,&rsquo; said the Old Woman, &lsquo;what a sight you are, I will
lace you properly for once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Snowdrop made no objection, and placed herself before the
Old Woman to let her lace her with the new lace. But the Old
Woman laced so quickly and tightly that she took away Snowdrop&rsquo;s
breath and she fell down as though dead.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now I am the fairest,&rsquo; she said to herself, and hurried
away.</p>

<p>Not long after the seven Dwarfs came home, and were
horror-struck when they saw their dear little Snowdrop lying
on the floor without stirring, like one dead. When they saw
she was laced too tight they cut the lace, whereupon she began
to breathe and soon came back to life again. When the
Dwarfs heard what had happened, they said that the old
Pedlar was no other than the wicked Queen. &lsquo;Take care not
to let any one in when we are not here,&rsquo; they said.</p>

<p>Now the wicked Queen, as soon as she got home, went to
the Glass and asked&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Mirror, Mirror on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest of us all?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
and it answered as usual&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Queen, thou art fairest here, I hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Snowdrop over the fells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with the seven Dwarfs dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fairer still a thousandfold.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she heard it all her blood flew to her heart, so enraged
was she, for she knew that Snowdrop had come back to life
again. Then she thought to herself, &lsquo;I must plan something
which will put an end to her.&rsquo; By means of witchcraft, in
which she was skilled, she made a poisoned comb. Next she
disguised herself and took the form of a different Old Woman.
She crossed the mountains and came to the home of the seven
Dwarfs, and knocked at the door calling out, &lsquo;Good wares to
sell.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Snowdrop looked out of the window and said, &lsquo;Go away, I
must not let any one in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At least you may look,&rsquo; answered the Old Woman, and
she took the poisoned comb and held it up.</p>

<p>The child was so pleased with it that she let herself be
beguiled, and opened the door.</p>

<p>When she had made a bargain the Old Woman said, &lsquo;Now
I will comb your hair properly for once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Poor Snowdrop, suspecting no evil, let the Old Woman
have her way, but scarcely was the poisoned comb fixed in
her hair than the poison took effect, and the maiden fell down
unconscious.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You paragon of beauty,&rsquo; said the wicked woman, &lsquo;now it is
all over with you,&rsquo; and she went away.</p>

<p>Happily it was near the time when the seven Dwarfs came
home. When they saw Snowdrop lying on the ground as
though dead, they immediately suspected her stepmother,
and searched till they found the poisoned comb. No sooner
had they removed it than Snowdrop came to herself again and
related what had happened. They warned her again to be on
her guard, and to open the door to no one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
When she got home the Queen stood before her Glass and
said&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Mirror, Mirror on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest of us all?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and it answered as usual&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Queen, thou art fairest here, I hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Snowdrop over the fells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who with the seven Dwarfs dwells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fairer still a thousandfold.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she heard the Glass speak these words she trembled and
quivered with rage. &lsquo;Snowdrop shall die,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;even if it
cost me my own life.&rsquo; Thereupon she went into a secret room,
which no one ever entered but herself, and made a poisonous
apple. Outwardly it was beautiful to look upon, with rosy
cheeks, and every one who saw it longed for it, but whoever
ate of it was certain to die. When the apple was ready she
dyed her face and dressed herself like an old Peasant Woman
and so crossed the seven hills to the Dwarfs&rsquo; home. There she
knocked.</p>

<p>Snowdrop put her head out of the window and said, &lsquo;I
must not let any one in, the seven Dwarfs have forbidden me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is all the same to me,&rsquo; said the Peasant Woman. &lsquo;I
shall soon get rid of my apples. There, I will give you one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; I must not take anything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you afraid of poison?&rsquo; said the woman. &lsquo;See,
I will cut the apple in half: you eat the red side and I will keep
the other.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the apple was so cunningly painted that the red half
alone was poisoned. Snowdrop longed for the apple, and
when she saw the Peasant Woman eating she could hold out
no longer, stretched out her hand and took the poisoned half.
Scarcely had she put a bit into her mouth than she fell dead to
the ground.</p>

<p>The Queen looked with a fiendish glance, and laughed aloud
and said, &lsquo;White as snow, red as blood, and black as ebony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
this time the Dwarfs cannot wake you up again.&rsquo; And when
she got home and asked the Looking-glass&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Mirror, Mirror on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest of us all?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>it answered at last&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Queen, thou&rsquo;rt fairest of them all.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then her jealous heart was at rest, as much at rest as a
jealous heart can be. The Dwarfs, when they came at evening,
found Snowdrop lying on the ground and not a breath escaped
her lips, and she was quite dead. They lifted her up and
looked to see whether any poison was to be found, unlaced her
dress, combed her hair, washed her with wine and water, but
it was no use; their dear child was dead. They laid her on a
bier, and all seven sat down and bewailed her and lamented
over her for three whole days. Then they prepared to bury
her, but she looked so fresh and living, and still had such
beautiful rosy cheeks, that they said, &lsquo;We cannot bury her
in the dark earth.&rsquo; And so they had a transparent glass
coffin made, so that she could be seen from every side, laid her
inside and wrote on it in letters of gold her name and how she
was a King&rsquo;s daughter. Then they set the coffin out on the
mountain, and one of them always stayed by and watched it.
And the birds came too and mourned for Snowdrop, first an
owl, then a raven, and lastly a dove.</p>

<p>Now Snowdrop lay a long, long time in her coffin, looking
as though she were asleep. It happened that a Prince was
wandering in the wood, and came to the home of the seven
Dwarfs to pass the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain
and lovely Snowdrop inside, and read what was written in
golden letters. Then he said to the Dwarfs, &lsquo;Let me have
the coffin; I will give you whatever you like for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But they said, &lsquo;We will not give it up for all the gold of the
world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he said, &lsquo;Then give it to me as a gift, for I cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
live without Snowdrop to gaze upon; and I will honour and
reverence it as my dearest treasure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When he had said these words the good Dwarfs pitied him
and gave him the coffin.</p>

<p>The Prince bade his servants carry it on their shoulders.
Now it happened that they stumbled over some brushwood,
and the shock dislodged the piece of apple from Snowdrop&rsquo;s
throat. In a short time she opened her eyes, lifted the lid of
the coffin, sat up and came back to life again completely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;O Heaven! where am I?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

<p>The Prince, full of joy, said, &lsquo;You are with me,&rsquo; and he
related what had happened, and then said, &lsquo;I love you better
than all the world; come with me to my father&rsquo;s castle and be
my wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Snowdrop agreed and went with him, and their wedding
was celebrated with great magnificence. Snowdrop&rsquo;s wicked
stepmother was invited to the feast; and when she had put
on her fine clothes she stepped to her Glass and asked&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Mirror, Mirror on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest of us all?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Glass answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Queen, thou art fairest here, I hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young Queen fairer a thousandfold.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so
terribly frightened that she didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Yet she
had no rest: she felt obliged to go and see the young Queen.
And when she came in she recognised Snowdrop, and stood
stock still with fear and terror. But iron slippers were heated
over the fire, and were soon brought in with tongs and put
before her. And she had to step into the red-hot shoes and
dance till she fell down dead.</p>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Pink</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a Queen, who had not been blessed
with children. As she walked in her garden, she
prayed every morning that a son or daughter might
be given to her. Then one day an Angel came, and said to her:
&lsquo;Be content: you shall have a son, and he shall be endowed
with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever he wishes for
shall be granted to him.&rsquo; She hurried to the King, and told
him the joyful news; and when the time came a son was born
to them, and they were filled with delight.</p>

<p>Every morning the Queen used to take her little son into
the gardens, where the wild animals were kept, to bathe him in
a clear, sparkling fountain. It happened one day, when the
child was a little older, that as she sat with him on her lap she
fell asleep.</p>

<p>The old Cook, who knew that the child had the power of
wishing, came by and stole it; he also killed a Chicken, and
dropped some of its blood on the Queen&rsquo;s garments. Then he
took the child away to a secret place, where he placed it out
to be nursed. Then he ran back to the King, and accused the
Queen of having allowed her child to be carried off by a wild
animal.</p>

<p>When the King saw the blood on the Queen&rsquo;s garments
he believed the story, and was overwhelmed with anger. He
caused a high tower to be built, into which neither the sun nor
the moon could penetrate. Then he ordered his wife to be
shut up in it, and the door walled up. She was to stay there
for seven years, without eating or drinking, so as gradually to
pine away. But two Angels from heaven, in the shape of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
white doves, came to her, bringing food twice a day till the
seven years were ended.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Cook thought, &lsquo;If the child really has the
power of wishing, and I stay here, I might easily fall into
disgrace.&rsquo; So he left the palace, and went to the boy, who
was then old enough to talk, and said to him, &lsquo;Wish for a
beautiful castle, with a garden, and everything belonging to it.&rsquo;
Hardly had the words passed the boy&rsquo;s lips than all that he
had asked for was there.</p>

<p>After a time the Cook said, &lsquo;It is not good for you to be
so much alone; wish for a beautiful Maiden to be your
companion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince uttered the wish, and immediately a Maiden
stood before them, more beautiful than any painter could
paint. So they grew very fond of each other, and played
together, while the old Cook went out hunting like any grand
gentleman. But the idea came to him one day that the
Prince might wish to go to his father some time, and he would
thereby be placed in a very awkward position. So he took
the Maiden aside, and said to her, &lsquo;To-night, when the boy is
asleep, go and drive this knife into his heart. Then bring me
his heart and his tongue. If you fail to do it, you will lose
your own life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he went away; but when the next day came the
Maiden had not yet obeyed his command, and she said, &lsquo;Why
should I shed his innocent blood, when he has never done harm
to any creature in his life?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Cook again said, &lsquo;If you do not obey me, you will lose
your own life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When he had gone away, she ordered a young hind to be
brought and killed; then she cut out its heart and its tongue,
and put them on a dish. When she saw the old man coming
she said to the boy, &lsquo;Get into bed, and cover yourself right
over.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old scoundrel came in and said, &lsquo;Where are the tongue
and the heart of the boy?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">The scullions brought live coals, which he had to eat till the
flames poured out of his mouth.</p>

<p>The Maiden gave him the dish; but the Prince threw off
the coverings, and said, &lsquo;You old sinner, why did you want
to kill me? Now hear your sentence. You shall be turned
into a black Poodle, with a gold chain round your neck, and
you shall be made to eat live coals, so that flames of fire may
come out of your mouth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As he said the words, the old man was changed into a
black Poodle, with a gold chain round his neck; and the
scullions brought live coals, which he had to eat till the flames
poured out of his mouth.</p>

<p>The Prince stayed on at the castle for a time, thinking of
his mother, and wondering if she were still alive. At last he
said to the Maiden, &lsquo;I am going into my own country. If
you like you can go with me; I will take you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
She answered: &lsquo;Alas! it is so far off, and what should I
do in a strange country where I know no one?&rsquo;</p>

<p>As she did not wish to go, and yet they could not bear to
be parted, he changed her into a beautiful Pink, which he took
with him.</p>

<p>Then he set out on his journey, and the Poodle was made
to run alongside till the Prince reached his own country.</p>

<p>Arrived there, he went straight to the tower where his
mother was imprisoned, and as the tower was so high he wished
for a ladder to reach the top. Then he climbed up, looked in,
and cried, &lsquo;Dearest mother, lady Queen, are you still alive?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She, thinking it was the Angels who brought her food come
back, said, &lsquo;I have just eaten; I do not want anything
more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he said, &lsquo;I am your own dear son whom the wild
animals were supposed to have devoured; but I am still alive,
and I shall soon come and rescue you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he got down and went to his father. He had himself
announced as a strange Huntsman, anxious to take service
with the King, who said, &lsquo;Yes; if he was skilled in game
preserving, and could procure plenty of venison, he would
engage him. But there had never before been any game in the
whole district.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman promised to procure as much game as the
King could possibly require for the royal table.</p>

<p>Then he called the whole Hunt together, and ordered them
all to come into the forest with him. He caused a great circle
to be enclosed, with only one outlet; then he took his place
in the middle, and began to wish as hard as he could. Immediately
over two hundred head of game came running into the
enclosure; these the Huntsmen had to shoot, and then they
were piled on to sixty country wagons, and driven home to the
King. So for once he was able to load his board with game,
after having had none for many years.</p>

<p>The King was much pleased, and commanded his whole
court to a banquet on the following day. When they were all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
assembled, he said to the Huntsman, &lsquo;You shall sit by me as
you are so clever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He answered, &lsquo;My lord and King, may it please your
Majesty, I am only a poor Huntsman!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King, however, insisted, and said, &lsquo;I command you
to sit by me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As he sat there, his thoughts wandered to his dear mother,
and he wished one of the courtiers would speak of her. Hardly
had he wished it than the Lord High Marshal said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your Majesty, we are all rejoicing here, how fares it with
Her Majesty the Queen? Is she still alive in the tower, or has
she perished?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the King answered, &lsquo;She allowed my beloved son to be
devoured by wild animals, and I do not wish to hear anything
about her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Huntsman stood up and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gracious father, she is still alive, and I am her son. He
was not devoured by wild animals; he was taken away by
the scoundrel of a Cook. He stole me while my mother was
asleep, and sprinkled her garments with the blood of a chicken.&rsquo;
Then he brought up the black Poodle with the golden chain,
and said, &lsquo;This is the villain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He ordered some live coals to be brought, which he made
the dog eat in the sight of all the people till the flames poured
out of his mouth. Then he asked the King if he would like
to see the Cook in his true shape, and wished him back, and
there he stood in his white apron, with his knife at his side.</p>

<p>The King was furious when he saw him, and ordered him
to be thrown into the deepest dungeon. Then the Huntsman
said further&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My father would you like to see the Maiden who so
tenderly saved my life when she was ordered to kill me,
although by so doing she might have lost her own life?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King answered, &lsquo;Yes, I will gladly see her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then his son said, &lsquo;Gracious father, I will show her to you
first in the guise of a beautiful flower.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
He put his hand into his pocket, and brought out the Pink.
It was a finer one than the King had ever seen before. Then
his son said, &lsquo;Now, I will show her to you in her true form.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The moment his wish was uttered, she stood before them
in all her beauty, which was greater than any artist could
paint.</p>

<p>The King sent ladies and gentlemen-in-waiting to the
tower to bring the Queen back to his royal table. But when
they reached the tower they found that she would no longer
eat or drink, and she said, &lsquo;The merciful God, who has
preserved my life so long, will soon release me now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Three days after she died. At her burial the two white
Doves which had brought her food during her captivity,
followed and hovered over her grave.</p>

<p>The old King caused the wicked Cook to be torn into four
quarters; but his own heart was filled with grief and remorse,
and he died soon after.</p>

<p>His son married the beautiful Maiden he had brought home
with him as a Flower, and, for all I know, they may be living
still.</p>

<h2>Briar Rose</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG time ago there lived a King and Queen, who
said every day, &lsquo;If only we had a child&rsquo;; but for
a long time they had none.</p>

<p>It fell out once, as the Queen was bathing, that a frog crept
out of the water on to the land, and said to her: &lsquo;Your wish
shall be fulfilled; before a year has passed you shall bring a
daughter into the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The frog&rsquo;s words came true. The Queen had a little girl
who was so beautiful that the King could not contain himself
for joy, and prepared a great feast. He invited not only his
relations, friends, and acquaintances, but the fairies, in order
that they might be favourably and kindly disposed towards
the child. There were thirteen of them in the kingdom, but
as the King had only twelve golden plates for them to eat
from, one of the fairies had to stay at home.</p>

<p>The feast was held with all splendour, and when it came
to an end the fairies all presented the child with a magic gift.
One gave her virtue, another beauty, a third riches, and so on,
with everything in the world that she could wish for.</p>

<p>When eleven of the fairies had said their say, the thirteenth
suddenly appeared. She wanted to revenge herself for not
having been invited. Without greeting any one, or even
glancing at the company, she called out in a loud voice:
&lsquo;The Princess shall prick herself with a distaff in her fifteenth
year and shall fall down dead&rsquo;; and without another word
she turned and left the hall.</p>

<p>Every one was terror-struck, but the twelfth fairy, whose
wish was still unspoken, stepped forward. She could not
cancel the curse, but could only soften it, so she said: &lsquo;It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
shall not be death, but a deep sleep lasting a hundred years,
into which your daughter shall fall.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">&lsquo;The Thirteenth Fairy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King was so anxious to guard his dear child from the
misfortune, that he sent out a command that all the distaffs
in the whole kingdom should be burned.</p>

alt="The King could not contain himself for joy." />
</div>

<p>As time went on all the promises of the fairies came true.
The Princess grew up so beautiful, modest, kind, and clever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
that every one who saw her could not but love her. Now it
happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years
old the King and Queen were away from home, and the
Princess was left quite alone in the castle. She wandered
about over the whole place, looking at rooms and halls as she
pleased, and at last she came to an old tower. She ascended
a narrow, winding staircase and reached a little door. A
rusty key was sticking in the lock, and when she turned it
the door flew open. In a little room sat an old woman with
a spindle, spinning her flax busily.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good day, Granny,&rsquo; said the Princess; &lsquo;what are you
doing?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am spinning,&rsquo; said the old woman, and nodded her head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the thing that whirls round so merrily?&rsquo; asked
the Princess; and she took the spindle and tried to spin too.</p>

<p>But she had scarcely touched it before the curse was fulfilled,
and she pricked her finger with the spindle. The instant she
felt the prick she fell upon the bed which was standing near,
and lay still in a deep sleep which spread over the whole castle.</p>

<p>The King and Queen, who had just come home and had
stepped into the hall, went to sleep, and all their courtiers with
them. The horses went to sleep in the stable, the dogs in the
yard, the doves on the roof, the flies on the wall; yes, even
the fire flickering on the hearth grew still and went to sleep,
and the roast meat stopped crackling; the cook, who was
pulling the scullion&rsquo;s hair because he had made some mistake,
let him go and went to sleep. The wind dropped, and on the
trees in front of the castle not a leaf stirred.</p>

<p>But round the castle a hedge of briar roses began to grow
up; every year it grew higher, till at last it surrounded the
whole castle so that nothing could be seen of it, not even the
flags on the roof.</p>

<p>But there was a legend in the land about the lovely sleeping
Briar Rose, as the King&rsquo;s daughter was called, and from time
to time princes came and tried to force a way through the
hedge into the castle. They found it impossible, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
thorns, as though they had hands, held them fast, and the
princes remained caught in them without being able to free
themselves, and so died a miserable death.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">But round the castle a hedge of briar roses began to grow up.</p>

<p>After many, many years a Prince came again to the country
and heard an old man tell of the castle which stood behind the
briar hedge, in which a most beautiful maiden called Briar
Rose had been asleep for the last hundred years, and with
her slept the King, Queen, and all her courtiers. He knew
also, from his grandfather, that many princes had already
come and sought to pierce through the briar hedge, and had
remained caught in it and died a sad death.</p>

<p>Then the young Prince said, &lsquo;I am not afraid; I am determined
to go and look upon the lovely Briar Rose.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadbase" style="width: 446px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
The good old man did all in his power to dissuade him, but
the Prince would not listen to his words.</p>

<p>Now, however, the hundred years were just ended, and the
day had come when Briar Rose was to wake up again. When
the Prince approached the briar hedge it was in blossom, and
was covered with beautiful large flowers which made way for
him of their own accord and let him pass unharmed, and then
closed up again into a hedge behind him.</p>

<p>In the courtyard he saw the horses and brindled hounds
lying asleep, on the roof sat the doves with their heads under
their wings: and when he went into the house the flies were
asleep on the walls, and near the throne lay the King and
Queen; in the kitchen was the cook, with his hand raised
as though about to strike the scullion, and the maid sat with
the black fowl in her lap which she was about to pluck.</p>

<p>He went on further, and all was so still that he could hear
his own breathing. At last he reached the tower, and opened
the door into the little room where Briar Rose was asleep.
There she lay, looking so beautiful that he could not take
his eyes off her; he bent down and gave her a kiss. As he
touched her, Briar Rose opened her eyes and looked lovingly
at him. Then they went down together; and the King woke
up, and the Queen, and all the courtiers, and looked at each
other with astonished eyes. The horses in the stable stood
up and shook themselves, the hounds leaped about and
wagged their tails, the doves on the roof lifted their heads
from under their wings, looked round, and flew into the
fields; the flies on the walls began to crawl again, the fire in
the kitchen roused itself and blazed up and cooked the food,
the meat began to crackle, and the cook boxed the scullion&rsquo;s
ears so soundly that he screamed aloud, while the maid finished
plucking the fowl. Then the wedding of the Prince and
Briar Rose was celebrated with all splendour, and they lived
happily till they died.</p>

<h2>The Jew among the Thorns</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a rich Man, and he had a Servant who
served him well and faithfully. He was first up in
the morning, and last to go to bed at night. If there
was any hard work to be done which no one else would do,
he was always ready to undertake it. He never made any
complaint, but was always merry and content.</p>

<p>When his year of service was over, his Master did not give
him any wages, thinking: &lsquo;This is my wisest plan. I save
by it, and he is not likely to run away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Servant said nothing, and served the second year like
the first. And when at the end of the second he again received
no wages, he still appeared contented, and stayed on. When
the third year had passed, the Master bethought himself, and
put his hand into his pocket, but he brought it out empty.</p>

<p>At last the Servant said: &lsquo;Master, I have served you well
and truly for three years; please pay me my wages. I want
to go away and look about the world a bit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Miser answered: &lsquo;Yes, my good fellow, you have
served me honestly, and you shall be liberally rewarded.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Again he put his hand into his pocket, and counted three
farthings, one by one, into the Servant&rsquo;s hand, and said:
&lsquo;There, you have a farthing for every year; that is better
wages than you would get from most masters.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The good Servant, who knew little about money, put away
his fortune, and thought: &lsquo;Now my pocket is well filled, I
need no longer trouble myself about work.&rsquo; Then he left and
went singing down the hill, and dancing, in the lightness of
his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
Now it so happened that as he was passing a thicket, that
a little Mannikin came out and cried: &lsquo;Whither away, my
merry fellow? I see your troubles are not too heavy to be
borne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why should I be sad?&rsquo; answered the Servant. &lsquo;I have
three years&rsquo; wages in my pocket.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And how much is your treasure?&rsquo; asked the Mannikin.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How much? Why, three good farthings.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Listen!&rsquo; said the Mannikin. &lsquo;I am a poor needy
fellow; give me your three farthings. I can&rsquo;t work any more;
but you are young, and can easily earn your bread.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the Servant had a good heart, and he was sorry for the
poor little man, so he gave him his three farthings, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take them, in the name of heaven! I shall not miss them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Mannikin, &lsquo;I see what a good heart you
have. I will give you three wishes, one for each farthing;
and every wish shall be fulfilled.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said the Servant, &lsquo;you are a wonder-worker I see.
Very well, then. First, I wish for a gun which will hit everything
I aim at; secondly, for a fiddle which will make every
one dance when I play; and, thirdly, if I ask anything of any
one, that he shall not be able to refuse my request.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You shall have them all,&rsquo; said the Mannikin, diving into
the bushes, where, wonderful to relate, lay the gun and the
fiddle ready, just as if they had been ordered beforehand.
He gave them to the Servant, and said: &lsquo;No one will be able
to refuse anything you ask.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Heart alive! what more can one desire,&rsquo; said the Servant
to himself, as he went merrily on.</p>

<p>Soon after, he met a Jew with a long goat&rsquo;s beard, who was
standing still listening to the song of a bird sitting on the top
of a tree. &lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; he was saying, &lsquo;what a tremendous
noise such a tiny creature makes. If only it were
mine! If one could but put some salt upon its tail!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If that is all,&rsquo; said the Servant, &lsquo;the bird shall soon come
down.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
He took aim, and down fell the bird into a quickset hedge.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go, you rogue,&rsquo; he said to the Jew, &lsquo;and pick up the bird.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Leave out the &ldquo;rogue,&rdquo; young man. I will get the bird
sure enough, as you have killed it for me,&rsquo; said the Jew.</p>

<p>He lay down on the ground and began to creep into the
hedge.</p>

alt="The Jew is tangled in the thorns" />
</div>

<p class="caption">The Jew was forced to spring up and begin to dance.</p>

<p>When he had got well among the thorns, a spirit of mischief
seized the Servant, and he began to play his fiddle with all
his might. The Jew was forced to spring up and begin to
dance, and the more the Servant played, the faster he had to
dance. The thorns tore his shabby coat, combed his goat&rsquo;s
beard, and scratched him all over.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Merciful Heavens!&rsquo; cried the Jew. &lsquo;Leave off that
fiddling! I don&rsquo;t want to dance, my good fellow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Servant paid no attention to him, but thought:
&lsquo;You have fleeced plenty of people in your time, my man, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
the thorns shan&rsquo;t spare you now!&rsquo; And he played on and on,
so that the Jew had to jump higher and higher, till his coat
hung in ribbons about him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cry &ldquo;enough!&rdquo;&rsquo; screamed the Jew. &lsquo;I will give you
anything you like if you will only stop. Take the purse, it is
full of gold.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, well, if you are so open-handed,&rsquo; said the Servant, &lsquo;I
am quite ready to stop my music, but I must say in praise of
your dancing, that it has quite a style of its own.&rsquo; Then he
took the purse and went on his way.</p>

<p>The Jew stood still looking after him till he was a good
way off, then he screamed with all his might: &lsquo;You miserable
fiddler! Just you wait till I find you alone! I will chase
you till the soles of your shoes drop off&mdash;you rascal!&rsquo; And
he went on pouring out a stream of abuse. Having relieved
himself by so doing, he hurried off to the Judge in the nearest
town.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just look here, your worship,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;look how I have
been attacked, and ill-treated, and robbed on the high road by
a wretch. My condition might melt the heart of a stone;
my clothes and my body torn and scratched, and my purse
with all my poor little savings taken away from me. All my
beautiful ducats, each one prettier than the other. Oh dear!
Oh dear! For heaven&rsquo;s sake, put the wretch in prison.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Judge said: &lsquo;Was it a soldier who punished you so
with his sword?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Heaven preserve us!&rsquo; cried the Jew, &lsquo;he had no sword,
but he had a gun on his shoulder and a fiddle round his neck.
The villain is easily to be recognised.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Judge sent out men in pursuit of the honest Servant,
who had walked on slowly. They soon overtook him, and the
purse of gold was found on him. When he was brought before
the Judge, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never touched the Jew, nor did I take his money away;
he offered it to me of his own free will if I would only stop
playing, because he could not bear my music.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
&lsquo;Heaven defend us!&rsquo; screamed the Jew, &lsquo;his lies are as
thick as flies on the wall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the Judge did not believe him either, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is a very lame excuse;
no Jew ever did
such a thing.&rsquo; So he sentenced
the honest Servant
to the gallows for having
committed a robbery upon
the king&rsquo;s highway.</p>

<p>When he was being led
away, the Jew screamed
after him; &lsquo;You vagabond,
you dog of a fiddler,
now you will get your
deserts!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Servant mounted
the ladder to the gallows
quite quietly, with the
halter round his neck;
but at the last rung he
turned round and said
to the Judge: &lsquo;Grant
me one favour before I
die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said the
Judge, &lsquo;as long as you
don&rsquo;t ask for your life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not my life,&rsquo; answered
the Servant. &lsquo;I
only ask to play my
fiddle once more.&rsquo;</p>

alt="A man's shoe flies off as he kicks his leg" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Dancing as hard as he could.</p>

<p>The Jew raised a tremendous
cry. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t allow it, your worship, for heaven&rsquo;s
sake, don&rsquo;t allow it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Judge said: &lsquo;Why should I deny him that short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
pleasure? His wish is granted, and there&rsquo;s an end of the
matter!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He could not have refused even if he had wished, because
of the Mannikin&rsquo;s gift to the Servant.</p>

<p>The Jew screamed, &lsquo;Oh dear! Oh dear! Tie me tight,
tie me tight!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The good Servant took his fiddle from his neck, and put
it into position, and at the first chord everybody began to wag
their heads, the Judge, his Clerk, and all the Officers of Justice,
and the rope fell out of the hand of the man about to bind the
Jew.</p>

<p>At the second scrape, they all lifted their legs, and the
Hangman let go his hold of the honest Servant, to make ready
to dance.</p>

<p>At the third scrape they one and all leapt into the air, and
began to caper about, the Judge and the Jew at the head,
and they all leapt their best.</p>

<p>Soon, every one who had come to the market-place out of
curiosity, old and young, fat and lean, were dancing as hard
as they could; even the dogs got upon their hind legs, and
pranced about with the rest. The longer he played, the
higher they jumped, till they knocked their heads together,
and made each other cry out.</p>

<p>At last the Judge, quite out of breath, cried: &lsquo;I will give
you your life, if only you will stop playing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The honest Servant allowed himself to be prevailed upon,
laid his fiddle aside, and came down the ladder. Then he
went up to the Jew, who lay upon the ground gasping, and
said to him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You rascal, confess where you got the money, or I will
begin to play again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I stole it! I stole it!&rsquo; he screamed; &lsquo;but you have
honestly earned it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Judge then ordered the Jew to the gallows to be
hanged as a thief.</p>

<h2>Ashenputtel</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE wife of a rich man fell ill, and when she felt that she
was nearing her end, she called her only daughter to
her bedside, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear child, continue devout and good, then God will
always help you, and I will look down upon you from heaven,
and watch over you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon she closed her eyes, and breathed her last.</p>

<p>The maiden went to her mother&rsquo;s grave every day and
wept, and she continued to be devout and good. When the
winter came, the snow spread a white covering on the grave,
and when the sun of spring had unveiled it again, the husband
took another wife. The new wife brought home with her
two daughters, who were fair and beautiful to look upon, but
base and black at heart.</p>

<p>Then began a sad time for the unfortunate step-child.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is this stupid goose to sit with us in the parlour?&rsquo; they
said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whoever wants to eat bread must earn it; go and sit
with the kitchenmaid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They took away her pretty clothes, and made her put on an
old grey frock, and gave her wooden clogs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just look at the proud Princess, how well she&rsquo;s dressed,&rsquo;
they laughed, as they led her to the kitchen. There, the girl
was obliged to do hard work from morning till night, to get
up at daybreak, carry water, light the fire, cook, and wash.
Not content with that, the sisters inflicted on her every
vexation they could think of; they made fun of her, and
tossed the peas and lentils among the ashes, so that she had to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
sit down and pick them out again. In the evening, when she
was worn out with work, she had no bed to go to, but had to
lie on the hearth among the cinders. And because, on account
of that, she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her
Ashenputtel.</p>

<p>It happened one day that the Father had a mind to go to
the Fair. So he asked both his step-daughters what he should
bring home for them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fine clothes,&rsquo; said one.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pearls and jewels,&rsquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you, Ashenputtel?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what will you have?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Father, break off for me the first twig which brushes
against your hat on your way home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Well, for his two step-daughters he brought beautiful
clothes, pearls and jewels, and on his way home, as he was
riding through a green copse, a hazel twig grazed against him
and knocked his hat off. Then he broke off the branch and
took it with him.</p>

<p>When he got home he gave his step-daughters what they
had asked for, and to Ashenputtel he gave the twig from the
hazel bush.</p>

<p>Ashenputtel thanked him, and went to her mother&rsquo;s grave
and planted the twig upon it; she wept so much that her
tears fell and watered it. And it took root and became a
fine tree.</p>

<p>Ashenputtel went to the grave three times every day, wept
and prayed, and every time a little white bird came and
perched upon the tree, and when she uttered a wish, the little
bird threw down to her what she had wished for.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the King proclaimed a festival,
which was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful
maidens in the country were invited, in order that his son
might choose a bride.</p>

<p>When the two step-daughters heard that they were also to
be present, they were in high spirits, called Ashenputtel, and
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
&lsquo;Brush our hair and clean our shoes, and fasten our
buckles, for we are going to the feast at the King&rsquo;s palace.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ashenputtel obeyed, but wept, for she also would gladly
have gone to the ball with them, and begged her Step-mother
to give her leave to go.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You, Ashenputtel!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Why, you are covered
with dust and dirt. You go to the festival! Besides you
have no clothes or shoes, and yet you want to go to the ball.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As she, however, went on asking, her Step-mother said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I have thrown a dishful of lentils into the cinders, if
you have picked them all out in two hours you shall go with
us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl went through the back door into the garden, and
cried, &lsquo;Ye gentle doves, ye turtle doves, and all ye little birds
under heaven, come and help me,</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The good into a dish to throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bad into your crops can go.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then two white doves came in by the kitchen window,
and were followed by the turtle doves, and finally all the little
birds under heaven flocked in, chirping, and settled down
among the ashes. And the doves gave a nod with their little
heads, peck, peck, peck; and then the rest began also, peck,
peck, peck, and collected all the good beans into the dish.
Scarcely had an hour passed before they had finished, and all
flown out again.</p>

<p>Then the girl brought the dish to her Step-mother, and
was delighted to think that now she would be able to go to the
feast with them.</p>

<p>But she said, &lsquo;No, Ashenputtel, you have no clothes, and
cannot dance; you will only be laughed at.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But when she began to cry, the Step-mother said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you can pick out two whole dishes of lentils from the
ashes in an hour, you shall go with us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And she thought, &lsquo;She will never be able to do that.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>When her Step-mother had thrown the dishes of lentils
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
among the ashes, the girl went out through the back door,
and cried, &lsquo;Ye gentle doves, ye turtle doves, and all ye little
birds under heaven, come and help me,</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;The good into a dish to throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bad into your crops can go.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then two white doves came in by the kitchen window,
and were followed by the turtle doves, and all the other little
birds under heaven, and in less than an hour the whole had
been picked up, and they had all flown away.</p>

<p>Then the girl carried the dish to her Step-mother, and was
delighted to think that she would now be able to go to the ball.</p>

<p>But she said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit of good. You can&rsquo;t go with
us, for you&rsquo;ve got no clothes, and you can&rsquo;t dance. We
should be quite ashamed of you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon she turned her back upon her, and hurried off
with her two proud daughters.</p>

<p>As soon as every one had left the house, Ashenputtel went
out to her mother&rsquo;s grave under the hazel-tree, and cried:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Shiver and shake, dear little tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold and silver shower on me.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the bird threw down to her a gold and silver robe,
and a pair of slippers embroidered with silk and silver.
With all speed she put on the robe and went to the feast.
But her step-sisters and their mother did not recognise her,
and supposed that she was some foreign Princess, so beautiful
did she appear in her golden dress. They never gave a
thought to Ashenputtel, but imagined that she was sitting at
home in the dirt picking the lentils out of the cinders.</p>

<p>The Prince came up to the stranger, took her by the hand,
and danced with her. In fact, he would not dance with any
one else, and never left go of her hand. If any one came up
to ask her to dance, he said, &lsquo;This is my partner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She danced until nightfall, and then wanted to go home;
but the Prince said, &lsquo;I will go with you and escort you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
For he wanted to see to whom the beautiful maiden
belonged. But she slipped out of his way and sprang into the
pigeon-house.</p>

<p>Then the Prince waited till her Father came, and told him
that the unknown maiden had vanished into the pigeon-house.</p>

<p>The old man thought, &lsquo;Could it be Ashenputtel?&rsquo; And
he had an axe brought to him, so that he might break down
the pigeon-house, but there was no one inside.</p>

<p>When they went home, there lay Ashenputtel in her dirty
clothes among the cinders, and a dismal oil lamp was burning
in the chimney corner. For Ashenputtel had quietly jumped
down out of the pigeon-house and ran back to the hazel-tree.
There she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them
on the grave, and the bird had taken them away again. Then
she had settled herself among the ashes on the hearth in her
old grey frock.</p>

<p>On the second day, when the festival was renewed, and her
parents and step-sisters had started forth again, Ashenputtel
went to the hazel-tree, and said:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Shiver and shake, dear little tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold and silver shower on me.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the bird threw down a still more gorgeous robe than
on the previous day. And when she appeared at the festival
in this robe, every one was astounded by her beauty.</p>

<p>The King&rsquo;s son had waited till she came, and at once took
her hand, and she danced with no one but him. When others
came forward and invited her to dance, he said, &lsquo;This is my
partner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At nightfall she wished to leave; but the Prince went after
her, hoping to see into what house she went, but she sprang
out into the garden behind the house. There stood a fine
big tree on which the most delicious pears hung. She climbed
up among the branches as nimbly as a squirrel, and the Prince
could not make out what had become of her.</p>

<p>But he waited till her Father came, and then said to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
&lsquo;The unknown maiden has slipped away from me, and I think
that she has jumped into the pear-tree.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Father thought, &lsquo;Can it be Ashenputtel?&rsquo; And he
had the axe brought to cut down the tree, but there was no one
on it. When they went home and looked into the kitchen,
there lay Ashenputtel among the cinders as usual; for she
had jumped down on the other side of the tree, taken back the
beautiful clothes to the bird on the hazel-tree, and put on her
old grey frock.</p>

<p>On the third day, when her parents and sisters had started,
Ashenputtel went again to her mother&rsquo;s grave, and said:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Shiver and shake, dear little tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold and silver shower on me.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the bird threw down a dress which was so magnificent
that no one had ever seen the like before, and the slippers were
entirely of gold. When she appeared at the festival in this
attire, they were all speechless with astonishment. The
Prince danced only with her, and if any one else asked her to
dance, he said, &lsquo;This is my partner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When night fell and she wanted to leave, the Prince was
more desirous than ever to accompany her, but she darted
away from him so quickly that he could not keep up with
her. But the Prince had used a stratagem, and had caused
the steps to be covered with cobbler&rsquo;s wax. The consequence
was, that as the maiden sprang down them, her left slipper
remained sticking there. The Prince took it up. It was
small and dainty, and entirely made of gold.</p>

<p>The next morning he went with it to Ashenputtel&rsquo;s Father,
and said to him, &lsquo;No other shall become my wife but she whose
foot this golden slipper fits.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The two sisters were delighted at that, for they both had
beautiful feet. The eldest went into the room intending to
try on the slipper, and her Mother stood beside her. But her
great toe prevented her getting it on, her foot was too long.</p>

<p>Then her Mother handed her a knife, and said, &lsquo;Cut off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
the toe; when you are Queen you won&rsquo;t have to walk any
more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl cut off her toe, forced her foot into the slipper,
stifled her pain, and went out to the Prince. Then he took
her up on his horse as his Bride, and rode away with her.</p>

<p>However, they had to pass the grave on the way, and there
sat the two Doves on the hazel-tree, and cried:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Prithee, look back, prithee, look back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&rsquo;s blood on the track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shoe is too small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At home the true Bride is waiting thy call.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was
streaming from it. So he turned his horse round and carried
the false Bride back to her home, and said that she was not
the right one; the second sister must try the shoe.</p>

<p>Then she went into the room, and succeeded in getting her
toes into the shoe, but her heel was too big.</p>

<p>Then her Mother handed her a knife, and said, &lsquo;Cut a bit
off your heel; when you are Queen you won&rsquo;t have to walk
any more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced her foot into the
shoe, stifled her pain, and went out to the Prince.</p>

<p>Then he took her up on his horse as his Bride, and rode off
with her.</p>

<p>As they passed the grave, the two Doves were sitting on the
hazel-tree, and crying:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Prithee, look back, prithee, look back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There&rsquo;s blood on the track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shoe is too small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At home the true Bride is waiting thy call.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He looked down at her foot and saw that it was streaming
with blood, and there were deep red spots on her stockings.
Then he turned his horse and brought the false Bride back to
her home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
&lsquo;This is not the right one either,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Have you no
other daughter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the man. &lsquo;There is only a daughter of my
late wife&rsquo;s, a puny, stunted drudge, but she cannot possibly
be the Bride.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince said that she must be sent for.</p>

<p>But the Mother answered, &lsquo;Oh no, she is much too dirty;
she mustn&rsquo;t be seen on any account.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was, however, absolutely determined to have his way,
and they were obliged to summon Ashenputtel.</p>

<p>When she had washed her hands and face, she went up and
curtsied to the Prince, who handed her the golden slipper.</p>

<p>Then she sat down on a bench, pulled off her wooden clog
and put on the slipper, which fitted to a nicety.</p>

<p>And when she stood up and the Prince looked into her
face, he recognised the beautiful maiden that he had danced
with, and cried: &lsquo;This is the true Bride!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Step-mother and the two sisters were dismayed and
turned white with rage; but he took Ashenputtel on his horse
and rode off with her.</p>

<p>As they rode past the hazel-tree the two White Doves
cried:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Prithee, look back, prithee, look back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No blood&rsquo;s on the track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shoe&rsquo;s <em>not</em> too small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You carry the true Bride home to your hall.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when they had said this they both came flying down,
and settled on Ashenputtel&rsquo;s shoulders, one on the right, and
one on the left, and remained perched there.</p>

<p>When the wedding was going to take place, the two false
sisters came and wanted to curry favour with her, and take
part in her good fortune. As the bridal party was going to
the church, the eldest was on the right side, the youngest on
the left, and the Doves picked out one of the eyes of each of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
Afterwards, when they were coming out of the church,
the elder was on the left, the younger on the right, and the
Doves picked out the other eye of each of them. And so for
their wickedness and falseness they were punished with
blindness for the rest of their days.</p>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span></p>

<h2>The White Snake</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG time ago there lived a King whose wisdom was
celebrated far and wide. Nothing was unknown to
him, and news of the most secret transactions seemed
to reach him through the air.</p>

<p>Now he had one very odd habit. Every day at dinner,
when the courtiers had withdrawn, and he was quite alone,
a trusted Servant had to bring in another dish. It was always
covered, and even the Servant did not know what it contained,
nor any one else, for the King never uncovered it till he was
alone. This had gone on for a long time, when one day the
Servant who carried the dish was overcome by his curiosity,
and took the dish to his own room.</p>

<p>When he had carefully locked the door, he took the dish-cover
off, and saw a White Snake lying on the dish.</p>

<p>At the sight of it, he could not resist tasting it; so he cut
a piece off, and put it into his mouth.</p>

<p>Hardly had he tasted it, however, when he heard a wonderful
whispering of delicate voices.</p>

<p>He went to the window and listened, and he noticed that
the whispers came from the sparrows outside. They were
chattering away, and telling each other all kinds of things
that they had heard in the woods and fields. Eating the
Snake had given him the power of understanding the language
of birds and animals.</p>

<p>Now it happened on this day that the Queen lost her most
precious ring, and suspicion fell upon this trusted Servant
who went about everywhere.</p>

<p>The King sent for him, and threatened that if it was not
found by the next day, he would be sent to prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
In vain he protested his innocence; he was not believed.</p>

<p>In his grief and anxiety he went down into the courtyard
and wondered how he should get out of his difficulty.</p>

<p>A number of Ducks were lying peaceably together by a
stream, stroking down their feathers with their bills, while
they chattered gaily.</p>

<p>The Servant stood still to listen to them. They were
telling each other of their morning&rsquo;s walks and experiences.</p>

<p>Then one of them said somewhat fretfully: &lsquo;I have
something lying heavy on my stomach. In my haste I
swallowed the Queen&rsquo;s ring this morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Servant quickly seized it by the neck, carried it off
into the kitchen, and said to the Cook: &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a fine fat
Duck. You had better kill it at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; said the Cook, weighing it in her hand.
&lsquo;It has spared no pains in stuffing itself; it should have been
roasted long ago.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she killed it, and cut it open, and there, sure enough,
was the Queen&rsquo;s ring.</p>

<p>The Servant had now no difficulty in proving his innocence,
and the King, to make up for his injustice, gave the Servant
leave to ask any favour he liked, and promised him the highest
post about the Court which he might desire.</p>

<p>The Servant, however, declined everything but a horse,
and some money to travel with, as he wanted to wander about
for a while, to see the world.</p>

<p>His request being granted, he set off on his travels, and
one day came to a pond, where he saw three Fishes caught
among the reeds, and gasping for breath. Although it is said
that fishes are dumb, he understood their complaint at
perishing thus miserably. As he had a compassionate heart,
he got off his horse and put the three captives back into the
water. They wriggled in their joy, stretched up their heads
above the water, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We will remember that you saved us, and reward you for
it.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadbase" style="width: 407px;">
<a name="pl05" id="pl05"></a>
<img src="images/pl05.jpg" width="407" height="560"
alt="The Fishes, in their joy, stretched up their heads above the water, and promised to reward him." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
He rode on again, and after a time he seemed to hear a
voice in the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an
Ant-King complain: &lsquo;I wish these human beings and their
animals would keep out of our way. A clumsy horse has just
put his hoof down upon a number of my people in the most
heartless way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He turned his horse into a side path, and the Ant-King
cried: &lsquo;We will remember and reward you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The road now ran through a forest, and he saw a pair of
Ravens standing by their nest throwing out their young.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Away with you, you gallows birds,&rsquo; they were saying.
&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t feed you any longer. You are old enough to look
after yourselves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor little nestlings lay on the ground, fluttering and
flapping their wings, and crying: &lsquo;We, poor helpless children,
to feed ourselves, and we can&rsquo;t even fly! We shall die of
hunger, there is nothing else for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The good Youth dismounted, killed his horse with his
sword, and left the carcase as food for the young Ravens.
They hopped along to it, and cried: &lsquo;We will remember and
reward you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now he had to depend upon his own legs, and after going
a long way he came to a large town.</p>

<p>There was much noise and bustle in the streets, where a
man on horseback was making a proclamation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The King&rsquo;s daughter seeks a husband, but any one who
wishes to sue for her hand must accomplish a hard task; and
if he does not bring it to a successful issue, he will forfeit his
life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Many had already attempted the task, but they had risked
their lives in vain.</p>

<p>When the Youth saw the Princess, he was so dazzled by
her beauty that he forgot all danger, at once sought an audience
of the King, and announced himself as a suitor.</p>

<p>He was immediately led out to the seashore, and a golden
ring was thrown into the water before his eyes. Then the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
King ordered him to fetch it out from the depths of the sea,
and added&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you come to land without it, you will be thrown back
every time till you perish in the waves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Every one pitied the handsome Youth, but they had to go
and leave him standing solitary on the seashore.</p>

<p>He was pondering over what he should do, when, all at
once, he saw three Fishes swimming towards him. They were
no others than the very ones whose lives he had saved.</p>

<p>The middle one carried a mussel-shell in its mouth, which
it laid on the sand at the feet of the Youth. When he picked
it up, and opened it, there lay the ring.</p>

<p>Full of joy, he took it to the King, expecting that he would
give him the promised reward.</p>

<p>The proud Princess, however, when she heard that he was
not her equal, despised him, and demanded that he should
perform yet another task.</p>

<p>So she went into the garden herself, and strewed ten sacks
of millet seeds among the grass.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He must pick up every one of those before the sun rises
to-morrow morning,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;Not a grain must be missing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Youth sat miserably in the garden, wondering how it
could possibly be done. But as he could not think of a plan,
he remained sadly waiting for the dawn which would bring
death to him.</p>

<p>But when the first sunbeams fell on the garden, he saw the
ten sacks full to the top, and not a grain was missing. The
Ant-King had come in the night with thousands and thousands
of his Ants, and the grateful creatures had picked up the
millet and filled the sacks.</p>

<p>The Princess came into the garden herself, and saw with
amazement that the Youth had completed the task.</p>

<p>But still she could not control her proud heart, and she
said: &lsquo;Even if he has accomplished these two tasks, he shall
not become my husband till he brings me an apple from the
tree of life.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
The Youth had no idea where to find the tree of life.
However, he started off, meaning to walk as far as his legs
would carry him; but he had no hope of finding it.</p>

<p>When he had travelled through three kingdoms, he was
one night passing through a great forest, and he lay down
under a tree to sleep.</p>

<p>He heard a rustling among the branches, and a golden
apple fell into his hand. At the same time three Ravens flew
down and perched on his knee, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;We are the young Ravens you saved from death. When
we grew big, and heard that you were looking for the golden
apple, we flew across the sea to the end of the world, where
the tree of life stands, and brought you the apple.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Youth, delighted, started on his homeward journey,
and took the golden apple to the beautiful Princess, who had
now no further excuse to offer.</p>

<p>They divided the apple of life, and ate it together, and
then her heart was filled with love for him, and they lived
happily to a great age.</p>

<h2>The Wolf and the Seven Kids</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once an old Nanny-goat who had seven
Kids, and she was just as fond of them as a mother
of her children. One day she was going into the
woods to fetch some food for them, so she called them all up
to her, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear children, I am going out into the woods. Beware
of the Wolf! If once he gets into the house, he will eat you
up, skin, and hair, and all. The rascal often disguises himself,
but you will know him by his rough voice and his black feet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Kids said, &lsquo;Oh, we will be very careful, dear mother.
You may be quite happy about us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Bleating tenderly, the old Goat went off to her work.
Before long, some one knocked at the door, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Open the door, dear children! Your mother has come
back and brought something for each of you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Kids knew quite well by the voice that it was the
Wolf.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We won&rsquo;t open the door,&rsquo; they cried. &lsquo;You are not our
mother. She has a soft gentle voice; but yours is rough,
and we are quite sure that you are the Wolf.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he went away to a shop and bought a lump of chalk,
which he ate, and it made his voice quite soft. He went back,
knocked at the door again, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Open the door, dear children. Your mother has come
back and brought something for each of you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Wolf had put one of his paws on the window sill,
where the Kids saw it, and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We won&rsquo;t open the door. Our mother has not got a
black foot as you have; you are the Wolf.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
Then the Wolf ran to a Baker, and said, &lsquo;I have bruised
my foot; please put some dough on it.&rsquo; And when the Baker
had put some dough on his foot, he ran to the Miller and said,
&lsquo;Strew some flour on my foot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Miller thought, &lsquo;The old Wolf is going to take
somebody in,&rsquo; and refused.</p>

<p>But the Wolf said, &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t do it, I will eat you up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Miller was frightened, and whitened his paws.
People are like that, you know.</p>

<p>Now the wretch went for the third time to the door, and
knocked, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Open the door, children. Your dear mother has come
home, and has brought something for each of you out of the
wood.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Kids cried, &lsquo;Show us your feet first, that we may be
sure you are our mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He put his paws on the window sill, and when they saw
that they were white, they believed all he said, and opened
the door.</p>

<p>Alas! It was the Wolf who walked in. They were
terrified, and tried to hide themselves. One ran under the
table, the second jumped into bed, the third into the oven,
the fourth ran into the kitchen, the fifth got into the cupboard,
the sixth into the wash-tub, and the seventh hid in the tall
clock-case. But the Wolf found them all but one, and made
short work of them. He swallowed one after the other,
except the youngest one in the clock-case, whom he did not
find. When he had satisfied his appetite, he took himself off,
and lay down in a meadow outside, where he soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>Not long after the old Nanny-goat came back from the
woods. Oh! what a terrible sight met her eyes! The house
door was wide open, table, chairs, and benches were overturned,
the washing bowl was smashed to atoms, the covers
and pillows torn from the bed. She searched all over the
house for her children, but nowhere were they to be found.
She called them by name, one by one, but no one answered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
At last, when she came to the youngest, a tiny voice
cried:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am here, dear mother, hidden in the clock-case.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She brought him out, and he told her that the Wolf had
come and devoured all the others.</p>

<p>You may imagine how she wept over her children.</p>

<p>At last, in her grief, she went out, and the youngest Kid
ran by her side. When they went into the meadow, there
lay the Wolf under a tree, making the branches shake with his
snores. They examined him from every side, and they could
plainly see movements within his distended body.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, heavens!&rsquo; thought the Goat, &lsquo;is it possible that my
poor children whom he ate for his supper, should be still alive?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She sent the Kid running to the house to fetch scissors,
needles, and thread. Then she cut a hole in the monster&rsquo;s
side, and, hardly had she begun, when a Kid popped out its
head, and as soon as the hole was big enough, all six jumped
out, one after the other, all alive, and without having suffered
the least injury, for, in his greed, the monster had swallowed
them whole. You may imagine the mother&rsquo;s joy. She
hugged them, and skipped about like a tailor on his wedding
day. At last she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go and fetch some big stones, children, and we will fill
up the brute&rsquo;s body while he is asleep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the seven Kids brought a lot of stones, as fast as they
could carry them, and stuffed the Wolf with them till he could
hold no more. The old mother quickly sewed him up, without
his having noticed anything, or even moved.</p>

<p>At last, when the Wolf had had his sleep out, he got up,
and, as the stones made him feel very thirsty, he wanted to
go to a spring to drink. But as soon as he moved the stones
began to roll about and rattle inside him. Then he cried&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the rumbling and tumbling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sets my stomach grumbling?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now find it&rsquo;s nought but rolling stones.&rsquo;<br /></span>

When he reached the spring, and stooped over the water
to drink, the heavy stones dragged him down, and he was
drowned miserably.</p>

<p>When the seven Kids saw what had happened, they came
running up, and cried aloud&mdash;&lsquo;The Wolf is dead, the Wolf
is dead!&rsquo; and they and their mother capered and danced
round the spring in their joy.</p>

<h2>The Queen Bee</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time two Princes started off in search of
adventure, and, falling into a wild, free mode of life,
did not come home again.</p>

<p>The third Brother, who was called the Blockhead, set out
to look for the other two. But when at last he found them,
they mocked him for thinking of making his way in the world
with his simplicity, while they, who were so much cleverer,
could not get on.</p>

<p>They all three went on together till they came to an ant-heap.
The two elder Princes wanted to disturb it, to see how
the little ants crept away, carrying their eggs.</p>

<p>But the Blockhead said: &lsquo;Leave the little creatures alone;
I will not allow you to disturb them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they went on further till they came to a lake, in which
a great many ducks were swimming about. The two wanted
to catch and roast a pair.</p>

<p>But the Blockhead would not allow it, and said: &lsquo;Leave
the creatures alone. You shall not kill them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last they came to a bee&rsquo;s nest, containing such a
quantity of honey that it flowed round the trunk of the tree.</p>

<p>The two Princes wanted to set fire to the tree, and suffocate
the bees, so as to remove the honey.</p>

<p>But the Blockhead stopped them again, and said: &lsquo;Leave
the creatures alone. I will not let you burn them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last the three Brothers came to a castle, where the
stables were full of stone horses, but not a soul was to be seen.
They went through all the rooms till they came to a door quite
at the end, fastened with three bolts. In the middle of the
door was a lattice, through which one could see into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
There they saw a little grey Man sitting at a table. They
called to him once&mdash;twice&mdash;but he did not hear them. Finally,
when they had called him the third time, he stood up and
opened the door, and came out. He said not a word, but led
them to a richly-spread table, and when they had eaten and
drunk, he took them each to a bedroom.</p>

<p>The next morning the little grey Man came to the eldest
Prince, beckoned, and led him to a stone tablet whereon were
inscribed three tasks by means of which the castle should be
freed from enchantment.</p>

<p>This was the first task: In the wood, under the moss, lay
the Princesses&rsquo; pearls, a thousand in number. These had all
to be found, and if at sunset a single one were missing, the
seeker was turned to stone.</p>

<p>The eldest went away, and searched all day, but when
evening came, he had only found the first hundred, and it
happened as the inscription foretold. He was turned to stone.</p>

<p>The next day the second Brother undertook the quest;
but he fared no better than the first, for he only found two
hundred pearls, and he too was turned to stone.</p>

<p>At last came the Blockhead&rsquo;s turn; he searched in the
moss, but the pearls were hard to find, and he got on but slowly.</p>

<p>Then he sat down on a rock and cried, and as he was sitting
there, the Ant-King, whose life he had saved, came up with five
thousand ants, and it was not long before the little creatures
had found all the pearls and laid them in a heap.</p>

<p>Now the second task was to get the key of the Princesses&rsquo;
room out of the lake.</p>

<p>When the Blockhead came to the lake, the ducks he had
once saved, swam up, dived, and brought up the key from the
depths.</p>

<p>But the third task was the hardest. The Prince had to
find out which was the youngest and most charming of the
Princesses while they were asleep.</p>

<p>They were exactly alike, and could not be distinguished in
any way, except that before going to sleep each had eaten a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
different kind of sweet. The eldest a piece of sugar, the
second a little syrup, and the third a spoonful of honey.</p>

<p>Then the Queen of the Bees, whom the Blockhead had
saved from burning, came and tried the lips of all three.
Finally, she settled on the mouth of the one who had eaten the
honey, and so the Prince recognised the right one.</p>

<p>Then the charm was broken and everything in the castle
was set free, and those who had been turned to stone took
human form again.</p>

<p>And the Blockhead married the youngest and sweetest
Princess, and became King after her father&rsquo;s death, while his
two Brothers married the other sisters.</p>

<h2>The Elves and the Shoemaker</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a Shoemaker who, through no fault of
his own, had become so poor that at last he had only
leather enough left for one pair of shoes. At evening
he cut out the shoes which he intended to begin upon the next
morning, and since he had a good conscience, he lay down
quietly, said his prayers, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning when he had said his prayers, and was
preparing to sit down to work, he found the pair of shoes
standing finished on his table. He was amazed, and could not
understand it in the least.</p>

<p>He took the shoes in his hand to examine them more closely.
They were so neatly sewn that not a stitch was out of place,
and were as good as the work of a master-hand.</p>

<p>Soon after a purchaser came in, and as he was much pleased
with the shoes, he paid more than the ordinary price for them,
so that the Shoemaker was able to buy leather for two pairs of
shoes with the money.</p>

<p>He cut them out in the evening, and next day, with fresh
courage, was about to go to work; but he had no need to, for
when he got up, the shoes were finished, and buyers were not
lacking. These gave him so much money that he was able to
buy leather for four pairs of shoes.</p>

<p>Early next morning he found the four pairs finished, and so
it went on; what he cut out at evening was finished in the
morning, so that he was soon again in comfortable circumstances,
and became a well-to-do man.</p>

<p>Now it happened one evening, not long before Christmas,
when he had cut out some shoes as usual, that he said to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
Wife: &lsquo;How would it be if we were to sit up to-night to see
who it is that lends us such a helping hand?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Wife agreed, lighted a candle, and they hid themselves
in the corner of the room behind the clothes which were
hanging there.</p>

<p>At midnight came two little naked men who sat down at
the Shoemaker&rsquo;s table, took up the cut-out work, and began
with their tiny fingers to stitch, sew, and hammer so neatly
and quickly, that the Shoemaker could not believe his eyes.
They did not stop till everything was quite finished, and stood
complete on the table; then they ran swiftly away.</p>

<p>The next day the Wife said: &lsquo;The little men have made us
rich, and we ought to show our gratitude. They were running
about with nothing on, and must freeze with cold. Now I will
make them little shirts, coats, waistcoats, and hose, and will
even knit them a pair of stockings, and you shall make them
each a pair of shoes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Husband agreed, and at evening, when they had everything
ready, they laid out the presents on the table, and hid
themselves to see how the little men would behave.</p>

<p>At midnight they came skipping in, and were about to set
to work; but, instead of the leather ready cut out, they found
the charming little clothes.</p>

<p>At first they were surprised, then excessively delighted.
With the greatest speed they put on and smoothed down the
pretty clothes, singing:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Now we&rsquo;re boys so fine and neat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why cobble more for other&rsquo;s feet?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they hopped and danced about, and leapt over chairs
and tables and out at the door. Henceforward, they came
back no more, but the Shoemaker fared well as long as he lived,
and had good luck in all his undertakings.</p>

<h2>The Wolf and the Man</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> FOX was one day talking to a Wolf about the strength
of man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No animals,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;could withstand man, and
they were obliged to use cunning to hold their own against
him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Wolf answered, &lsquo;If ever I happened to see a man, I
should attack him all the same.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I can help you to that,&rsquo; said the Fox. &lsquo;Come to me
early to-morrow, and I will show you one!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Wolf was early astir, and the Fox took him out to a
road in the forest, traversed daily by a Huntsman.</p>

<p>First came an old discharged soldier.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that a Man?&rsquo; asked the Wolf.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered the Fox. &lsquo;He has been a Man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After that, a little boy appeared on his way to school.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that a Man?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; he is going to be a Man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last the Huntsman made his appearance, his gun on his
back, and his hunting-knife at his side. The Fox said to the
Wolf,&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look! There comes a Man. You may attack him, but I
will make off to my hole!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Wolf set on the Man, who said to himself when he saw
him, &lsquo;What a pity my gun isn&rsquo;t loaded with ball,&rsquo; and fired a
charge of shot in the Wolf&rsquo;s face. The Wolf made a wry face,
but he was not to be so easily frightened, and attacked him
again. Then the Huntsman gave him the second charge.
The Wolf swallowed the pain, and rushed at the Huntsman;
but he drew his bright hunting-knife, and hit out right and left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
with it, so that, streaming with blood, the Wolf ran back to the
Fox.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, brother Wolf,&rsquo; said the Fox, &lsquo;and how did you get on
with the Man?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said the Wolf. &lsquo;I never thought the strength of
man would be what it is. First, he took a stick from his
shoulder, and blew into it, and something flew into my face,
which tickled frightfully. Then he blew into it again, and it
flew into my eyes and nose like lightning and hail. Then he
drew a shining rib out of his body, and struck at me with it till
I was more dead than alive.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, you see,&rsquo; said the Fox, &lsquo;what a braggart you are.
You throw your hatchet so far that you can&rsquo;t get it back again.&rsquo;</p>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span></p>

<h2>The Turnip</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE were once two Brothers who both served as
soldiers, and one was rich and the other was poor.</p>

<p>The poor one, wishing to better himself, discarded
his uniform and worked like a Peasant. Then he dug and hoed
his little field and sowed Turnips.</p>

<p>The seed came up, and one of the Turnips grew to such an
enormous size, that it seemed as though it would never have
finished; and it might have been called the Queen of Turnips,
for its like had never been seen before, nor ever will be again.</p>

<p>At last it was so big that it filled a cart, and needed two
oxen to draw it; and the Peasant could not imagine what
would come of it, whether it would bring good luck or bad.</p>

<p>At last he said to himself: &lsquo;If I sell it what shall I gain?
I might eat it, but the little Turnips would do as well for that.
The best thing will be to take it to the King and offer it to
him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he loaded a cart, harnessed two oxen, and took it to the
Court to present it to the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is that extraordinary object?&rsquo; said the King. &lsquo;I
have seen many marvels in my time, but never anything so
remarkable as this. What seed did it spring from? Perhaps
it belongs to you, especially if you are a child of good luck?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; said the Peasant, &lsquo;lucky I certainly am not, for I
am a poor Soldier, who, since he could keep himself no longer,
has hung up his uniform on a nail, and tills the earth. Further,
I have a Brother who is rich, and well known to you, my Lord
King; but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by all the
world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the King pitied him and said: &lsquo;Your poverty shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
be at an end, and you shall receive such rich presents from me
that your wealth will equal that of your Brother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he gave him plenty of gold, lands, fields, and
flocks, and enriched him with precious stones, so that the other
Brother&rsquo;s wealth could not be compared with his.</p>

<p>Now, when the rich Brother heard what his Brother with
the single Turnip had acquired, he envied him, and pondered
how he might gain a like treasure for himself.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 298px;">

<img src="images/ill10.png" width="298" height="200"
alt="The Turnip is carried off in a cart" />
</div>

<p class="caption">So the rich Brother had to put his Brother&rsquo;s Turnip into
a cart, and have it taken home.</p>

<p>But he wanted to show himself much cleverer, so he took
gold and horses and presented them to the King, feeling certain
that he would give him a far handsomer gift; for if his Brother
got so much for a Turnip, what would not he get for his
beautiful things.</p>

<p>The King took the present, saying that he could give him in
return nothing rarer or better than the huge Turnip.</p>

<p>So the rich Brother had to put his Brother&rsquo;s Turnip into a
cart, and have it taken home.</p>

<p>Then he did not know on whom to expend his wrath and
bitterness, till evil thoughts came to him, and he determined
to kill his Brother.</p>

<p>He hired Murderers, who were to place themselves in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
ambush, and then he went to his Brother, and said: &lsquo;Dear
Brother, I know of a secret treasure which we will carry off
and divide.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The other agreed, and went without suspicion. But when
they got out, the Murderers sprang upon him, bound him, and
prepared to hang him on a tree.</p>

<p>While they were about it, they heard in the distance the
clatter of hoofs and the sound of singing, which frightened them
so much that they stuck their Prisoner into a sack, head foremost,
slung it up on a branch, and took to flight.</p>

<p>But the Man up in the sack worked a hole in it, and stuck
his head through.</p>

<p>Now the traveller turned out to be nothing more than a
Student, a young fellow who was riding through the wood,
singing cheerily.</p>

<p>When the Man up in the sack saw some one down below,
he called out: &lsquo;Good-day. You come in the nick of time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Student looked all round, but could not make out
where the voice came from.</p>

<p>At last he said: &lsquo;Who calls?&rsquo;</p>

<p>A voice from above answered: &lsquo;Raise your eyes, I am
sitting up here in the Sack of Wisdom, and in a short time I
have learnt so much that the wisdom of the schools is as air
compared to mine. Soon I shall be quite perfect, and shall
come down and be the wisest of all mankind. I understand
the stars and signs of the heavens, the blowing of the winds,
the sand of the sea, the healing of sickness, the power of herbs,
birds, and stones. If you were once inside, you would feel
what wonders flow from the Sack of Knowledge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the Student heard this he was astonished, and said:
&lsquo;Blessed be the hour when I met you, if only I too might get
into the sack for a little.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The other answered, as though unwillingly: &lsquo;I will let you
in for a little while for payment and kind words, but you must
wait an hour, as there is something rather difficult which I
must learn first.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
But when the Student had waited a little, he grew impatient
and entreated permission to get in, so great was his thirst for
knowledge. Then the Man in the sack pretended to give in,
and said: &lsquo;In order that I may get out of the sack you must
let it down, then you can get in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Student let it down, undid the sack and released the
Prisoner, and said: &lsquo;Now pull me up as fast as possible&rsquo;;
and he tried to get into the sack and stand upright in it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;That won&rsquo;t do.&rsquo; And he packed
him in head first, tied it up, and slung up the Disciple of
Wisdom, dangling him in the air, and said: &lsquo;How are you, my
dear fellow? You will soon feel wisdom coming upon you,
and will have a most interesting experience. Sit still till you
are wiser.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he mounted the Student&rsquo;s horse, and rode off,
but sent some one in an hour to let him down again.</p>

<h2>Clever Hans</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HERE are you going, Hans?&rsquo; asked his Mother.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To see Grettel,&rsquo; answered Hans.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Behave well, Hans!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, Mother. Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Hans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans comes to Grettel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Hans. What have you brought me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve not brought you anything. I want a present.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Grettel gives him a needle. Hans takes the needle, and
sticks it in a load of hay, and walks home behind the cart.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good evening, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Grettel&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What did you give her?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I gave her nothing. But she made me a present.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What did she give you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She gave me a needle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What did you do with it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stuck it in the hay-cart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was stupid, Hans. You should have stuck it in your
sleeve.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Mother; I&rsquo;ll do better next time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Hans?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To see Grettel, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Behave well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, Mother. Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

&lsquo;Good morning, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Hans. What have you brought me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought nothing. But I want something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Grettel gives him a knife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Hans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans takes the knife, and sticks it in his sleeve, and goes
home.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good evening, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Been to see Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I gave her nothing. But she gave me something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She gave me a knife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where is the knife, Hans?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I stuck it in my sleeve.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a stupid place, Hans. You should have put it in
your pocket.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Mother; I&rsquo;ll do better next time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Hans?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To see Grettel, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Behave well, then.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, Mother. Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans comes to Grettel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Hans. Have you brought me anything
nice?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought nothing. What have you got for me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Grettel gives him a young kid.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Hans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans takes the kid, ties its legs together, and puts it in
his pocket.</p>

<p>When he got home, it was suffocated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
&lsquo;Good evening, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Been to see Grettel, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What did you give her?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I gave her nothing. But I brought away something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What did Grettel give you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She gave me a young kid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What did you do with the kid?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Put it in my pocket, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was very stupid. You should have led it by a rope.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Mother; I&rsquo;ll manage better next time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Hans?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To see Grettel, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Manage well, then.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, Mother. Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Hans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans comes to Grettel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Hans. What have you brought me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you nothing. What have you got for
me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Grettel gives him a piece of bacon.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Hans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans takes the bacon, ties a rope round it, and drags it
along behind him. The dogs come after him, and eat it up.
When he got home he had the rope in his hand, but there was
nothing at the end of it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good evening, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
&lsquo;I tied it to a rope, and dragged it home.
But the dogs ate it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was a stupid business, Hans. You
should have carried it on your head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Mother; I&rsquo;ll do better
next time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Hans?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To see Grettel, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Behave properly, then.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, Mother.
Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Hans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans comes to
Grettel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Hans. What have you brought me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought nothing. What have you got for me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Grettel gives Hans a calf.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Grettel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Hans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans takes the calf, and puts it on his head. It kicks his
face.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She gave me a calf, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What did you do with the calf?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Put it on my head, Mother, and it kicked my face.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was very stupid, Hans. You should have led it by
a rope, and put it in the cow-stall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind, Mother; I&rsquo;ll do better next time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Hans?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To see Grettel, Mother.&rsquo;</p>

Hans.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, Mother. Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans goes to Grettel.</p>

her.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>The Three Languages</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE once lived in Switzerland an old Count, who had
an only son; but he was very stupid, and could learn
nothing. So his father said to him: &lsquo;Listen to me,
my son. I can get nothing into your head, try as hard as I
may. You must go away from here, and I will hand you over
to a renowned Professor for a whole year.&rsquo; At the end of the
year he came home again, and his father asked: &lsquo;Now, my
son, what have you learnt?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Father, I have learnt the language of dogs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mercy on us!&rsquo; cried his father, &lsquo;is that all you have
learnt? I will send you away again to another Professor in a
different town.&rsquo; The youth was taken there, and remained
with this Professor also for another year. When he came back
his father asked him again: &lsquo;My son, what have you learnt?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He answered: &lsquo;I have learnt bird language.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the father flew into a rage, and said: &lsquo;Oh, you hopeless
creature, have you been spending all this precious time and
learnt nothing? Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed to come into my
presence? I will send you to a third Professor, but if you
learn nothing this time, I won&rsquo;t be your father any longer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The son stopped with the third Professor in the same way
for a whole year, and when he came home again and his father
asked, &lsquo;My son, what have you learnt?&rsquo; he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear father, this year I have learnt frog language.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon his father flew into a fearful passion, and said:
&lsquo;This creature is my son no longer. I turn him out of the house
and command you to lead him into the forest and take his life.&rsquo;</p>

alt="The youth listens to the Frogs" />
</div>

<p class="caption">On the way he passed a swamp, in which a number of Frogs were croaking.</p>

<p>They led him forth, but when they were about to kill him,
for pity&rsquo;s sake they could not do it, and let him go. Then they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
cut out the eyes and tongue of a Fawn, in order that they might
take back proofs to the old Count.</p>

<p>The youth wandered about, and at length came to a castle,
where he begged a night&rsquo;s lodging.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the Lord of the castle. &lsquo;If you like to
pass the night down there in the old tower, you may; but I
warn you that it will be at the risk of your life, for it is full of
savage dogs. They bark and howl without ceasing, and at
certain hours they must have a man thrown to them, and they
devour him at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The whole neighbourhood was distressed by the scourge,
but no one could do anything to remedy it. But the youth
was not a bit afraid, and said: &lsquo;Just let me go down to these
barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to them;
they won&rsquo;t do me any harm.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As he would not have anything else, they gave him some
food for the savage dogs, and took him down to the tower.</p>

<p>The dogs did not bark at him when he entered, but ran
round him wagging their tails in a most friendly manner, ate
the food he gave them, and did not so much as touch a hair of
his head.</p>

<p>The next morning, to the surprise of every one, he made his
appearance again, and said to the Lord of the castle, &lsquo;The Dogs
have revealed to me in their own language why they live there
and bring mischief to the country. They are enchanted, and
obliged to guard a great treasure which is hidden under the
tower, and will get no rest till it has been dug up; and how
that has to be done I have also learnt from them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Every one who heard this was delighted, and the Lord of the
castle said he would adopt him as a son if he accomplished the
task successfully. He went down to the tower again, and as he
knew how to set to work he accomplished his task, and brought
out a chest full of gold. The howling of the savage Dogs was
from that time forward heard no more. They entirely disappeared,
and the country was delivered from the scourge.</p>

<p>After a time, he took it into his head to go to Rome. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
the way he passed a swamp, in which a number of Frogs were
croaking. He listened, and when he heard what they were
saying he became quite pensive and sad.</p>

<p>At last he reached Rome, at a moment when the Pope had
just died, and there was great doubt among the Cardinals whom
they ought to name as his successor. They agreed at last that
the man to whom some divine miracle should be manifested
ought to be chosen as Pope. Just as they had come to this
decision, the young Count entered the church, and suddenly
two snow-white doves flew down and alighted on his shoulders.</p>

<p>The clergy recognised in this the sign from Heaven, and
asked him on the spot whether he would be Pope.</p>

<p>He was undecided, and knew not whether he was worthy of
the post; but the Doves told him that he might accept, and at
last he said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he was anointed and consecrated, and so was
fulfilled what he had heard from the Frogs on the way, which
had disturbed him so much&mdash;namely, that he should become
Pope.</p>

<p>Then he had to chant mass, and did not know one word of it.
But the two Doves sat upon his shoulders and whispered it
to him.</p>

<h2>The Fox and the Cat</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T happened once that the Cat met Mr. Fox in the wood, and
because she thought: &lsquo;He is clever and experienced in
all the ways of the world,&rsquo; she addressed him in a friendly
manner.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, dear Mr. Fox! how are you and how do
you get along in these hard times?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Fox, full of pride,
looked at the Cat from
head to foot for some time
hardly knowing whether he
would deign to answer or
not. At last he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you poor whisker-wiper,
you piebald fool, you
starveling mouse-hunter!
what has come into your
head? How dare you ask
me how I am getting on?
What sort of education
have you had? How many
arts are you master of?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">The Cat crept stealthily up to the
topmost branch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only one,&rsquo; said the
Cat, meekly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what might that
one be?&rsquo; asked the Fox.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When the hounds run after me, I can jump into a tree and
save myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; said the Fox. &lsquo;I am master of a hundred
arts, and I have a sack full of cunning tricks in addition. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
I pity you. Come with me, and I will teach you how to escape
the hounds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Just then, a huntsman came along with four hounds. The
Cat sprang trembling into a tree, and crept stealthily up to the
topmost branch, where she was entirely hidden by twigs and
leaves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Open your sack, Mr. Fox! open your sack!&rsquo; cried the
Cat; but the hounds had gripped him, and held him fast.</p>

<p>&lsquo;O Mr. Fox!&rsquo; cried the Cat, &lsquo;you with your hundred
arts, and your sack full of tricks, are caught, while I, with my
one, am safe. Had you been able to climb up here, you would
not have lost your life.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>The Four Clever Brothers</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a poor man who had four sons, and
when they were grown up, he said to them: &lsquo;Dear
children, you must go out into the world now, for I
have nothing to give you. You must each learn a trade and
make your own way in the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the four Brothers took their sticks in their hands, bid
their father good-bye, and passed out of the town gate.</p>

<p>When they had walked some distance, they came to four
cross roads, which led into four different districts. Then the
eldest one said: &lsquo;We must part here, but this day four years,
we will meet here again, having in the meantime done our
best to make our fortunes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then each one went his own way. The eldest met an old
man, who asked him where he came from, and what he was
going to do.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to learn a trade,&rsquo; he answered.</p>

<p>Then the Man said: &lsquo;Come with me and learn to be a
Thief.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;that is no longer considered an honest
trade; and the end of that song would be that I should swing
as the clapper in a bell.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the Man, &lsquo;you need not be afraid of the gallows.
I will only teach you how to take things no one else wants, or
knows how to get hold of, and where no one can find you out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he allowed himself to be persuaded, and under the
Man&rsquo;s instructions he became such an expert thief that nothing
was safe from him which he had once made up his mind to have.</p>

<p>The second Brother met a Man who put the same question
to him, as to what he was going to do in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet,&rsquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then come with me and be a Star-gazer. It is the grandest
thing in the world, nothing is hidden from you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was pleased with the idea, and became such a clever
Star-gazer, that when he had learnt everything and wanted
to go away, his master gave him a telescope, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;With this you can see everything that happens in the sky
and on earth, and nothing can remain hidden from you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The third Brother was taken in hand by a Huntsman, who
taught him everything connected with sport so well, that he
became a first-rate Huntsman.</p>

<p>On his departure his master presented him with a gun, and
said: &lsquo;This gun will never miss: whatever you aim at you will
hit without fail.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The youngest Brother also met a Man who asked him what
he was going to do.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be a Tailor?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rsquo; said the young man. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
much fancy sitting cross-legged from morning till night, and
everlastingly pulling a needle in and out, and pushing a flat
iron.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear, dear!&rsquo; said the Man, &lsquo;what are you talking about?
If you come to me you will learn quite a different sort of
tailoring. It is a most pleasant and agreeable trade, not to say
most honourable.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he allowed himself to be talked over, and went with the
Man, who taught him his trade thoroughly.</p>

<p>On his departure, he gave him a needle, and said: &lsquo;With
this needle you will be able to stitch anything together, be it as
soft as an egg, or as hard as steel; and it will become like a
whole piece of stuff with no seam visible.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the four years, which the Brothers had agreed upon,
had passed, they met at the cross-roads. They embraced one
another and hurried home to their Father.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said he, quite pleased to see them, &lsquo;has the wind
wafted you back to me again?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
They told him all that had happened to them, and that
each had mastered a trade. They were sitting in front of the
house under a big tree, and their Father said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, I will put you to the test, and see what you can do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he looked up and said to his second son&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is a chaffinch&rsquo;s nest in the topmost branch of this
tree; tell me how many eggs there are in it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Star-gazer took his glass and said: &lsquo;There are five.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His Father said to the eldest: &lsquo;Bring the eggs down without
disturbing the bird sitting on them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The cunning Thief climbed up and took the five eggs from
under the bird so cleverly that it never noticed they were gone,
and he gave them to his Father. His Father took them, and
put them one on each corner of the table, and one in the middle,
and said to the Sportsman&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must shoot the five eggs through the middle at one
shot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Sportsman levelled his gun, and divided each egg in
half at one shot, as his Father desired. He certainly must have
had some of the powder which shoots round the corner.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now it is your turn,&rsquo; said his Father to the fourth son.
&lsquo;You will sew the eggs together again, the shells and the young
birds inside them; and you will do it in such a manner that
they will be none the worse for the shot.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Tailor produced his needle, and stitched away as his
Father ordered. When he had finished, the Thief had to climb
up the tree again, and put the eggs back under the bird without
her noticing it. The bird spread herself over the eggs, and a
few days later the fledglings crept out of the shell, and they all
had a red line round their throats where the Tailor had sewn
them together.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old man to his sons; &lsquo;I can certainly praise
your skill. You have learnt something worth knowing, and
made the most of your time. I don&rsquo;t know which of you to
give the palm to. I only hope you may soon have a chance of
showing your skill so that it may be settled.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
Not long after this there was a great alarm raised in the
country: the King&rsquo;s only daughter had been carried off by a
Dragon. The King sorrowed for her day and night, and
proclaimed that whoever brought her back should marry her.</p>

<p>The four Brothers said to one another: &lsquo;This would be an
opportunity for us to prove what we can do.&rsquo; And they
decided to go out together to deliver the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall soon know where she is,&rsquo; said the Star-gazer, as he
looked through his telescope; and then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I see her already. She is a long way from here, she is
sitting on a rock in the middle of the sea, and the Dragon is
near, watching her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he went to the King and asked for a ship for himself
and his Brothers to cross the sea in search of the rock.</p>

<p>They found the Princess still on the rock, but the Dragon
was asleep with his head on her lap.</p>

<p>The Sportsman said: &lsquo;I dare not shoot. I should kill the
beautiful maiden.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I will try my luck,&rsquo; said the Thief, and he stole her
away from beneath the Dragon. He did it so gently and
skilfully, that the monster never discovered it, but went
snoring on.</p>

<p>Full of joy, they hurried away with her to the ship, and
steered for the open sea. But the Dragon on waking had
missed the Princess, and now came after them through the air,
foaming with rage.</p>

<p>Just as he was hovering over the ship and about to drop on
them, the Sportsman took aim with his gun and shot him
through the heart. The monster fell down dead, but he was
so huge, that in falling, he dragged the whole ship down with
him. They managed to seize a few boards, on which they kept
themselves afloat.</p>

</div>

<p>They were now in great straits, but the Tailor, not to be
outdone, produced his wonderful needle, and put some great
stitches into the boards, seated himself on them, and collected
all the floating bits of the ship. Then he stitched them all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
together so cleverly, that in a very short time the ship was
seaworthy again, and they sailed happily home.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">They found the Princess still on the rock, but the Dragon was asleep
with his head on her lap.</p>

<p>The King was overjoyed when he saw his daughter again,
and he said to the four Brothers: &lsquo;One of you shall marry her,
but which one, you must decide among yourselves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>An excited discussion then took place among them, for
each one made a claim.</p>

<p>The Star-gazer said: &lsquo;Had I not discovered the Princess,
all your arts would have been in vain, therefore she is mine!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Thief said: &lsquo;What would have been the good of
discovering her if I had not taken her from under the Dragon?
So she is mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Sportsman said: &lsquo;You, as well as the Princess, would
have been destroyed by the monster if my shot had not hit him.
So she is mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Tailor said: &lsquo;And if I had not sewn the ship together
with my skill, you would all have been drowned miserably.
Therefore she is mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King said: &lsquo;Each of you has an equal right; but, as
you can&rsquo;t all have her, none of you shall have her. I will give
every one of you half a kingdom as a reward.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Brothers were quite satisfied with this decision, and
they said: &lsquo;It is better so than that we should quarrel over it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So each of them received half a kingdom, and they lived
happily with their Father for the rest of their days.</p>

<h2>The Lady and the Lion</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a Man who had to take a long journey,
and when he was saying good-bye to his daughters
he asked what he should bring back to them.</p>

<p>The eldest wanted pearls, the second diamonds, but the
third said, &lsquo;Dear father, I should like a singing, soaring lark.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The father said, &lsquo;Very well, if I can manage it, you shall
have it&rsquo;; and he kissed all three and set off. He bought pearls
and diamonds for the two eldest, but he had searched everywhere
in vain for the singing, soaring lark, and this worried him,
for his youngest daughter was his favourite child.</p>

<p>Once his way led through a wood, in the midst of which was
a splendid castle; near it stood a tree, and right up at the top
he saw a lark singing and soaring. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have come
across you in the nick of time&rsquo;; and he called to his Servant to
dismount and catch the little creature. But as he approached
the tree a Lion sprang out from underneath, and shook himself,
and roared so that the leaves on the tree trembled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who dares to steal my lark?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I will eat up the
thief!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Man said, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that the bird was yours.
I will make up for my fault by paying a heavy ransom. Only
spare my life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Lion said, &lsquo;Nothing can save you, unless you
promise to give me whatever first meets you when you get
home. If you consent, I will give you your life and the bird
into the bargain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Man hesitated, and said, &lsquo;Suppose my youngest
and favourite daughter were to come running to meet me when
I go home!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
But the Servant was afraid, and said, &lsquo;Your daughter will
not necessarily be the first to come to meet you; it might just
as well be a cat or a dog.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Man let himself be persuaded, took the lark, and
promised to the Lion for his own whatever first met him on his
return home. When he reached home, and entered his house,
the first person who met him was none other than his youngest
daughter; she came running up and kissed and caressed him,
and when she saw that he had brought the singing, soaring lark,
she was beside herself with joy. But her father could not
rejoice; he began to cry, and said, &lsquo;My dear child, it has cost
me dear, for I have had to promise you to a Lion who will tear
you in pieces when he has you in his power.&rsquo; And he told her
all that had happened, and begged her not to go, come what
might.</p>

<p>But she consoled him, saying, &lsquo;Dear father, what you have
promised must be performed. I will go and will soon soften
the Lion&rsquo;s heart, so that I shall come back safe and sound.&rsquo;
The next morning the way was shown to her, and she said
good-bye and went confidently into the forest.</p>

<p>Now the Lion was an enchanted Prince, who was a Lion by
day, and all his followers were Lions too; but by night they
reassumed their human form. On her arrival she was kindly
received, and conducted to the castle. When night fell, the
Lion turned into a handsome man, and their wedding was
celebrated with due magnificence. And they lived happily
together, sitting up at night and sleeping by day. One day he
came to her and said, &lsquo;To-morrow there is a festival at your
father&rsquo;s house to celebrate your eldest sister&rsquo;s wedding; if you
would like to go my Lions shall escort you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She answered that she was very eager to see her father again,
so she went away accompanied by the Lions.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing on her coming, for they all thought
that she had been torn to pieces and had long been dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadbase" style="width: 423px;">
<a name="pl10" id="pl10"></a>
<img src="images/pl10.jpg" width="423" height="560"
alt="She went away accompanied by the Lions." />
</div>

<p>But she told them what a handsome husband she had and
how well she fared; and she stayed with them as long as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
wedding festivities lasted. Then she went back again into the
wood.</p>

<p>When the second daughter married, and the youngest was
again invited to the wedding, she said to the Lion, &lsquo;This time
I will not go alone, you must come too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Lion said it would be too dangerous, for if a gleam
of light touched him he would be changed into a Dove and
would have to fly about for seven years.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;only go with me, and I will protect you and
keep off every ray of light.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they went away together, and took their little child with
them too. They had a hall built with such thick walls that no
ray could penetrate, and thither the Lion was to retire when
the wedding torches were kindled. But the door was made of
fresh wood which split and caused a little crack which no one
noticed.</p>

<p>Now the wedding was celebrated with great splendour.
But when the procession came back from church with a large
number of torches and lights, a ray of light no broader than a
hair fell upon the Prince, and the minute this ray touched him
he was changed; and when his wife came in and looked for
him, she saw nothing but a White Dove sitting there. The
Dove said to her, &lsquo;For seven years I must fly about the world;
every seventh step I will let fall a drop of blood and a white
feather which will show you the way, and if you will follow the
track you can free me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the Dove flew out of the door, and she followed
it, and every seventh step it let fall a drop of blood and a little
white feather to show her the way. So she wandered about the
world, and never rested till the seven years were nearly passed.
Then she rejoiced, thinking that she would soon be free of her
troubles; but she was still far from release. One day as they
were journeying on in the accustomed way, the feather and the
drop of blood ceased falling, and when she looked up the Dove
had vanished.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Man cannot help me,&rsquo; she thought. So she climbed up to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
the Sun and said to it, &lsquo;You shine upon all the valleys and
mountain peaks, have you not seen a White Dove flying by?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Sun, &lsquo;I have not seen one; but I will give
you a little casket. Open it when you are in dire need.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She thanked the Sun, and went on till night, when the
Moon shone out. &lsquo;You shine all night,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;over field
and forest, have you seen a White Dove flying by?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered the Moon, &lsquo;I have seen none; but here is an
egg. Break it when you are in great need.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She thanked the Moon, and went on till the Night Wind
blew upon her. &lsquo;You blow among all the trees and leaves,
have not you seen a White Dove?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Night Wind, &lsquo;I have not seen one; but I
will ask the other three Winds, who may, perhaps, have seen it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The East Wind and the West Wind came, but they had
seen no Dove. Only the South Wind said, &lsquo;I have seen the
White Dove. It has flown away to the Red Sea, where it has
again become a Lion, since the seven years are over; and the
Lion is ever fighting with a Dragon who is an enchanted
Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Night Wind said, &lsquo;I will advise you. Go to the
Red Sea, you will find tall reeds growing on the right bank;
count them, and cut down the eleventh, strike the Dragon
with it and then the Lion will be able to master it, and both
will regain human shape. Next, look round, and you will see
the winged Griffin, who dwells by the Red Sea, leap upon its
back with your beloved, and it will carry you across the sea.
Here is a nut. Drop it when you come to mid-ocean; it will
open immediately and a tall nut-tree will grow up out of the
water, on which the Griffin will settle. Could it not rest, it
would not be strong enough to carry you across, and if you
forget to drop the nut, it will let you fall into the sea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then she journeyed on, and found everything as the Night
Wind had said. She counted the reeds by the sea and cut off
the eleventh, struck the Dragon with it, and the Lion mastered
it; immediately both regained human form. But when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
Princess who had been a Dragon was free from enchantment,
she took the Prince in her arms, seated herself on the Griffin&rsquo;s
back, and carried him off. And the poor wanderer, again
forsaken, sat down and cried. At last she took courage and
said to herself: &lsquo;Wherever the winds blow, I will go, and as
long as cocks crow, I will search till I find him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she went on a long, long way, till she came to the castle
where the Prince and Princess were living. There she heard
that there was to be a festival to celebrate their wedding.
Then she said to herself, &lsquo;Heaven help me,&rsquo; and she opened the
casket which the Sun had given her; inside it was a dress, as
brilliant as the Sun itself. She took it out, put it on, and went
into the castle, where every one, including the Bride, looked at
her with amazement. The dress pleased the Bride so much that
she asked if it was to be bought.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not with gold or goods,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;but with flesh
and blood.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Bride asked what she meant, and she answered, &lsquo;Let
me speak with the Bridegroom in his chamber to-night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Bride refused. However, she wanted the dress so
much that at last she consented; but the Chamberlain was
ordered to give the Prince a sleeping draught.</p>

<p>At night, when the Prince was asleep, she was taken to his
room. She sat down and said: &lsquo;For seven years I have
followed you. I have been to the Sun, and the Moon, and the
Four Winds to look for you. I have helped you against the
Dragon, and will you now quite forget me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Prince slept so soundly that he thought it was only
the rustling of the wind among the pine-trees. When morning
came she was taken away, and had to give up the dress; and
as it had not helped her she was very sad, and went out into a
meadow and cried. As she was sitting there, she remembered
the egg which the Moon had given her; she broke it open, and
out came a hen and twelve chickens, all of gold, who ran about
chirping, and then crept back under their mother&rsquo;s wings. A
prettier sight could not be seen. She got up and drove them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
about the meadow, till the Bride saw them from the window.
The chickens pleased her so much that she asked if they were
for sale. &lsquo;Not for gold and goods, but for flesh and blood.
Let me speak with the Bridegroom in his chamber once more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Bride said &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; intending to deceive her as before;
but when the Prince went to his room he asked the Chamberlain
what all the murmuring and rustling in the night meant. Then
the Chamberlain told him how he had been ordered to give him
a sleeping draught because a poor girl had been concealed in his
room, and that night he was to do the same again. &lsquo;Pour out
the drink, and put it near my bed,&rsquo; said the Prince. At night
she was brought in again, and when she began to relate her sad
fortunes he recognised the voice of his dear wife, sprang up, and
said, &lsquo;Now I am really free for the first time. All has been as
a dream, for the foreign Princess cast a spell over me so that I
was forced to forget you; but heaven in a happy hour has
taken away my blindness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they both stole out of the castle, for they feared the
Princess&rsquo;s father, because he was a sorcerer. They mounted
the Griffin, who bore them over the Red Sea, and when they
got to mid-ocean, she dropped the nut. On the spot a fine nut-tree
sprang up, on which the bird rested; then it took them
home, where they found their child grown tall and beautiful,
and they lived happily till the end.</p>

<h2>The Fox and the Horse</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> PEASANT once had a faithful Horse, but it had grown
old and could no longer do its work. Its master
grudged it food, and said: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t use you any more,
but I still feel kindly towards you, and if you show yourself
strong enough to bring me a Lion I will keep you to the end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
your days. But away with you now, out of my stable&rsquo;; and
he drove it out into the open country.</p>

<p>The poor Horse was very sad, and went into the forest to
get a little shelter from the wind and weather. There he met
a Fox, who said: &lsquo;Why do you hang your head, and wander
about in this solitary fashion?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; answered the Horse, &lsquo;avarice and honesty cannot
live together. My master has forgotten all the service I
have done him for these many years, and because I can no
longer plough he will no longer feed me, and he has driven
me away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Without any consideration?&rsquo; asked the Fox.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only the poor consolation of telling me that if I was strong
enough to bring him a Lion he would keep me, but he knows
well enough that the task is beyond me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Fox said: &lsquo;But I will help you. Just you lie down
here, and stretch your legs out as if you were dead.&rsquo; The
Horse did as he was told, and the Fox went to the Lion&rsquo;s den,
not far off, and said: &lsquo;There is a dead Horse out there. Come
along with me, and you will have a rare meal.&rsquo; The Lion went
with him, and when they got up to the Horse, the Fox said:
&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t eat it in comfort here. I&rsquo;ll tell you what. I will
tie it to you, and you can drag it away to your den, and enjoy
it at your leisure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The plan pleased the Lion, and he stood quite still, close to
the Horse, so that the Fox should fasten them together. But
the Fox tied the Lion&rsquo;s legs together with the Horse&rsquo;s tail, and
twisted and knotted it so that it would be quite impossible for
it to come undone.</p>

<p>When he had finished his work he patted the Horse on the
shoulder, and said: &lsquo;Pull, old Grey! Pull!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Horse sprang up, and dragged the Lion away
behind him. The Lion in his rage roared, so that all the birds
in the forest were terrified, and flew away. But the Horse let
him roar, and never stopped till he stood before his master&rsquo;s
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
When the master saw him he was delighted, and said to him:
&lsquo;You shall stay with me, and have a good time as long as you
live.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And he fed him well till he died.</p>

<h2>The Blue Light</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a Soldier who had served his King well
and faithfully for many years. But, on account of his
many wounds, he could serve no longer.</p>

<p>The King said: &lsquo;You can go home now. I have no
further need for you. I can only pay those who serve me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Soldier did not know what to do for a living, and he
went sadly away.</p>

<p>He walked all day, till he reached a wood, where, in the
distance, he saw a light. On approaching it, he found a house
inhabited by a Witch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray give me shelter for the night, and something to eat
and drink,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;or I shall perish.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh ho!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Who gives anything to a runaway
Soldier, I should like to know. But I will be merciful and
take you in, if you will do something for me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked the Soldier.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want you to dig up my garden to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Soldier agreed to this, and next day he worked as hard
as he could, but he could not finish before evening.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said the Witch, &lsquo;that you can do no more this
evening. I will keep you one night more, and to-morrow you
shall split up some logs for firewood.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Soldier took the whole day over this task, and in the
evening the Witch proposed that he should again stay another
night.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You shall only have a very light task to-morrow,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;There is an old, dry well behind my house. My light, which
burns blue, and never goes out, has fallen into it, and I want
you to bring it back.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
Next day the Witch led him to the well, and let him down
in a basket.</p>

<p>He found the light, and made a sign to be pulled up; but
when he was near the top, the Witch put out her hand, and
wanted to take it from him.</p>

<p>But he, seeing her evil designs, said: &lsquo;No; I will not give
you the light till I have both feet safe on dry land again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Witch flew into a passion, let him fall back into the
well again, and went away.</p>

<p>The poor Soldier fell on to the damp ground without taking
any harm, and the Blue Light burnt as brightly as ever. But
what was the good of that? He saw that he could not escape
death.</p>

<p>He sat for some time feeling very sad, then happening to
put his hand into his pocket, he found his pipe still half full.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This will be my last pleasure,&rsquo; he thought, as he lighted it
at the Blue Light, and began to smoke.</p>

<p>When the cloud of smoke he made cleared off a little, a tiny
black Man appeared before him, and asked: &lsquo;What orders,
Master?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; the Soldier asked in amazement.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must do anything that you command,&rsquo; said the Little
Man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, if that is so,&rsquo; said the Soldier, &lsquo;get me out of this well
first.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Little Man took him by the hand, and led him through
an underground passage; but the Soldier did not forget to
take the Blue Light with him.</p>

<p>On the way he showed the Soldier all the treasures the
Witch had amassed there, and he took as much gold as he
could carry.</p>

<p>When they reached the top he said to the Little Man:
&lsquo;Now go, bind the Witch and take her before the Judge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Before long she came by riding at a furious pace on a tom
cat, and screaming at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>The Little Man soon after appeared, and said: &lsquo;Everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
is done as you commanded, and the Witch hangs on the gallows.
What further orders have you, Master?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing at this moment,&rsquo; answered the Soldier. &lsquo;You
can go home; only be at hand when I call.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You only have to light your pipe at the Blue Light, and
I will be there,&rsquo; said the Little Man, and then he vanished.</p>

<p>The Soldier went back to the town that he had left, and
ordered some new clothes, then he went to the best inn and told
the landlord to give him the best rooms.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Before long the Witch came by riding at a furious pace on a tom cat.</p>

<p>When he had taken possession, he summoned the little
black Man, and said: &lsquo;I served my King faithfully, but he
sent me away to die of hunger. Now I will have my revenge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you wish me to do?&rsquo; asked the Little Man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Late at night, when the Princess is asleep in her bed, bring
her, sleeping, to me, and I will make her do menial service for
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is an easy enough thing for me to do,&rsquo; said the Little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
Man. &lsquo;But it will be a bad business for you if it comes
out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the clock struck twelve, the door sprang open, and the
Little Man bore the Maiden in.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah ha! There you are!&rsquo; cried the Soldier. &lsquo;Set about
your work at once. Fetch the broom and sweep the floor.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When she had finished, he sat down and ordered her to take
his boots off. Then he threw them at her, and made her pick
them up and clean them. She did everything he ordered
without resistance, silently, and with half-shut eyes.</p>

<p>At the first cock-crow, the Little Man carried her away to
the royal palace, and put her back in bed.</p>

<p>In the morning when the Princess got up, she went to her
Father, and told him that she had had an extraordinary dream.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was carried through the streets at lightning speed, and
taken to the room of a Soldier, whom I had to serve as a maid,
and do all kinds of menial work. I had to sweep the room, and
clean his boots. Of course, it was only a dream, and yet I am
as tired this morning as if I had done it all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The dream could not have been true,&rsquo; said the King.
&lsquo;But I will give you a piece of advice. Fill your pocket with
peas, and cut a little hole in it, then if you are carried away
again, they will drop out and leave a track on the road.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the King said this, the Little Man was standing by,
invisible, and heard it all.</p>

<p>At night, when he again carried off the Princess, the peas
certainly fell out of her pocket, but they were useless to trace
her by, for the cunning Little Man had scattered peas all over
the streets. Again the Princess had to perform her menial
duties till cock-crow.</p>

<p>The next morning the King sent out people who were to
find the track; but they were unable to do so, because in every
street the poor children were picking up peas, and saying:
&lsquo;It must have rained peas in the night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We must devise a better plan,&rsquo; said the King. &lsquo;Keep
your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
from the place where you are taken, hide one of them. I shall
be sure to find it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Little Man heard this plan also; and when the Soldier
told him to bring the Princess again, he advised him to put it
off. He said he knew no further means against their craftiness;
and if the shoe were found, it would be very dangerous
for his master.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do what I tell you,&rsquo; answered the Soldier; and for the
third time the Princess was brought and made to work like a
servant. But before leaving she hid one of her shoes under the
bed.</p>

<p>Next morning the King ordered the whole town to be
searched for his Daughter&rsquo;s shoe, and it was soon found in the
Soldier&rsquo;s room. He himself, at the request of the Little Man,
had gone outside the gates; but before long he was seized and
thrown into prison.</p>

<p>In his flight he had forgotten his greatest treasures, the
Blue Light and his gold. He had but one ducat in his
pocket.</p>

<p>As he stood at his window in the prison, loaded with chains,
he saw one of his comrades going by. He tapped on the pane,
and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Be so good as to fetch me the little bundle I left behind at
the inn, and I will give you a ducat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His comrade hurried off and brought him the bundle. As
soon as the Soldier was alone, he lighted his pipe and summoned
the Little Man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; he said to his Master. &lsquo;Go where they
take you, and let what will happen, only take the Blue Light
with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Next day a trial was held, and although the Soldier had
done no harm, the Judge sentenced him to death.</p>

<p>When he was led out to execution he asked a last favour of
the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is your wish?&rsquo; asked the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That I may smoke a last pipe.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
&lsquo;You may smoke three,&rsquo; answered the King. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t
imagine that I will therefore grant you your life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Soldier drew out his pipe, and lighted it at the
Blue Light.</p>

<p>As soon as a few rings of smoke arose, the Little Man appeared
with a little cudgel in his hand, and said: &lsquo;What is my
Master&rsquo;s command?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Strike the false Judge and his minions to the ground, and
do not spare the King either for all his cruelty to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Little Man flew about like lightning, zig-zag,
hither and thither, and whomever he touched with his cudgel
fell to the ground, and dared not move.</p>

<p>The King was now seized with alarm, and, begging on his
knees that his life might be spared, he rendered up his kingdom
and gave his Daughter to the Soldier to be his wife.</p>

<h2>The Goosegirl</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once an old Queen whose husband had been
dead for many years, and she had a very beautiful
daughter. When she grew up she was betrothed
to a Prince in a distant country. When the time came for
the maiden to be sent into this distant country to be married,
the old Queen packed up quantities of clothes and jewels,
gold and silver, cups and ornaments, and, in fact, everything
suitable to a royal outfit, for she loved her daughter very
dearly.</p>

<p>She also sent a Waiting-woman to travel with her, and to
put her hand into that of the bridegroom. They each had a
horse. The Princess&rsquo;s horse was called Falada, and it could
speak.</p>

<p>When the hour of departure came, the old Queen went to her
bedroom, and with a sharp little knife cut her finger and made
it bleed. Then she held a piece of white cambric under it,
and let three drops of blood fall on to it. This cambric she
gave to her daughter, and said, &lsquo;Dear child, take good care of
this; it will stand you in good stead on the journey.&rsquo; They
then bade each other a sorrowful farewell. The Princess hid
the piece of cambric in her bosom, mounted her horse, and set
out to her bridegroom&rsquo;s country.</p>

<p>When they had ridden for a time the Princess became very
thirsty, and said to the Waiting-woman, &lsquo;Get down and fetch
me some water in my cup from the stream. I must have
something to drink.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you are thirsty,&rsquo; said the Waiting-woman, &lsquo;dismount
yourself, lie down by the water and drink. I don&rsquo;t choose
to be your servant.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
So, in her great thirst, the Princess dismounted and stooped
down to the stream and drank, as she might not have her
golden cup. The poor Princess said, &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; and the drops
of blood answered, &lsquo;If your mother knew this, it would break
her heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The royal bride was humble, so she said nothing, but
mounted her horse again. Then they rode several miles
further; but the day was warm, the sun was scorching, and
the Princess was soon thirsty again.</p>

<p>When they reached a river she called out again to her
Waiting-woman, &lsquo;Get down, and give me some water in my
golden cup!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had forgotten all about the rude words which had been
said to her. But the Waiting-woman answered more
haughtily than ever, &lsquo;If you want to drink, get the water for
yourself. I won&rsquo;t be your servant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Being very thirsty, the Princess dismounted, and knelt by
the flowing water. She cried, and said, &lsquo;Ah me!&rsquo; and the
drops of blood answered, &lsquo;If your mother knew this it would
break her heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>While she stooped over the water to drink, the piece of
cambric with the drops of blood on it fell out of her bosom,
and floated away on the stream; but she never noticed this
in her great fear. The Waiting-woman, however, had seen
it, and rejoiced at getting more power over the bride, who,
by losing the drops of blood, had become weak and powerless.</p>

<p>Now, when she was about to mount her horse Falada again,
the Waiting-woman said, &lsquo;By rights, Falada belongs to me;
this jade will do for you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor little Princess was obliged to give way. Then
the Waiting-woman, in a harsh voice, ordered her to take off
her royal robes, and to put on her own mean garments.
Finally, she forced her to swear before heaven that she would
not tell a creature at the Court what had taken place. Had
she not taken the oath she would have been killed on the spot.
But Falada saw all this and marked it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
The Waiting-woman then mounted Falada and put
the real bride on her poor jade, and they continued their
journey.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing when they arrived at the castle.
The Prince hurried towards them, and lifted the Waiting-woman
from her horse, thinking she was his bride. She was
led upstairs, but the real Princess had to stay below.</p>

<p>The old King looked out of the window and saw the delicate,
pretty little creature standing in the courtyard; so he went
to the bridal apartments and asked the bride about her
companion, who was left standing in the courtyard, and
wished to know who she was.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I picked her up on the way, and brought her with me for
company. Give the girl something to do to keep her from
idling.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the old King had no work for her, and could not think
of anything. At last he said, &lsquo;I have a little lad who looks
after the geese; she may help him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy was called little Conrad, and the real bride was sent
with him to look after the geese.</p>

<p>Soon after, the false bride said to the Prince, &lsquo;Dear husband,
I pray you do me a favour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He answered, &lsquo;That will I gladly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, then, let the knacker be called to cut off the head
of the horse I rode; it angered me on the way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Really, she was afraid that the horse would speak, and tell
of her treatment of the Princess. So it was settled, and the
faithful Falada had to die.</p>

<p>When this came to the ear of the real Princess, she promised
the knacker a piece of gold if he would do her a slight service.
There was a great dark gateway to the town, through which
she had to pass every morning and evening. &lsquo;Would he nail
up Falada&rsquo;s head in this gateway, so that she might see him
as she passed?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadbase" style="width: 414px;">
<a name="pl11" id="pl11"></a>
<img src="images/pl11.jpg" width="414" height="600"
alt="Alas! dear Falada, there thou hangest." />
</div>

<p>The knacker promised to do as she wished, and when the
horse&rsquo;s head was cut off, he hung it up in the dark gateway.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
In the early morning, when she and Conrad went through the
gateway, she said in passing&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Alas! dear Falada, there thou hangest.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the Head answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Alas! Queen&rsquo;s daughter, there thou gangest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thy mother knew thy fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heart would break with grief so great.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they passed on out of the town, right into the fields,
with the geese. When they reached the meadow, the Princess
sat down on the grass and let down her hair. It shone like
pure gold, and when little Conrad saw it, he was so delighted
that he wanted to pluck some out; but she said&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Blow, blow, little breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Conrad&rsquo;s hat seize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him join in the chase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While away it is whirled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till my tresses are curled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I rest in my place.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then a strong wind sprang up, which blew away Conrad&rsquo;s
hat right over the fields, and he had to run after it. When
he came back, she had finished combing her hair, and it was
all put up again; so he could not get a single hair. This
made him very sulky, and he would not say another word to
her. And they tended the geese till evening, when they went
home.</p>

<p>Next morning, when they passed under the gateway, the
Princess said&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Alas! dear Falada, there thou hangest.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Falada answered:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Alas! Queen&rsquo;s daughter, there thou gangest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thy mother knew thy fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heart would break with grief so great.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
Again, when they reached the meadows, the Princess undid
her hair and began combing it. Conrad ran to pluck some
out; but she said quickly&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Blow, blow, little breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Conrad&rsquo;s hat seize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him join in the chase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While away it is whirled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till my tresses are curled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I rest in my place.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The wind sprang up and blew Conrad&rsquo;s hat far away over
the fields, and he had to run after it. When he came back
the hair was all put up again, and he could not pull a single
hair out. And they tended the geese till the evening. When
they got home Conrad went to the old King, and said, &lsquo;I
won&rsquo;t tend the geese with that maiden again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; asked the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, she vexes me every day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old King then ordered him to say what she did to vex
him.</p>

<p>Conrad said, &lsquo;In the morning, when we pass under the dark
gateway with the geese, she talks to a horse&rsquo;s head which is
hung up on the wall. She says&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Alas! Falada, there thou hangest,&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the Head answers&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Alas! Queen&rsquo;s daughter, there thou gangest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thy mother knew thy fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heart would break with grief so great.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Conrad went on to tell the King all that happened in the
meadow, and how he had to run after his hat in the wind.</p>

<p>The old King ordered Conrad to go out next day as usual.
Then he placed himself behind the dark gateway, and heard
the Princess speaking to Falada&rsquo;s head. He also followed
her into the field, and hid himself behind a bush, and with
his own eyes he saw the Goosegirl and the lad come driving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
the geese into the field. Then, after a time, he saw the girl
let down her hair, which glittered in the sun. Directly after
this, she said&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Blow, blow, little breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Conrad&rsquo;s hat seize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him join in the chase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While away it is whirled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till my tresses are curled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I rest in my place.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then came a puff of wind, which carried off Conrad&rsquo;s hat
and he had to run after it. While he was away, the maiden
combed and did up her hair; and all this the old King
observed. Thereupon he went away unnoticed; and in the
evening, when the Goosegirl came home, he called her aside
and asked why she did all these things.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That I may not tell you, nor may I tell any human
creature; for I have sworn it under the open sky, because if
I had not done so I should have lost my life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He pressed her sorely, and gave her no peace, but he could
get nothing out of her. Then he said, &lsquo;If you won&rsquo;t tell me,
then tell your sorrows to the iron stove there&rsquo;; and he went
away.</p>

<p>She crept up to the stove, and, beginning to weep and
lament, unburdened her heart to it, and said: &lsquo;Here I am,
forsaken by all the world, and yet I am a Princess. A false
Waiting-woman brought me to such a pass that I had to take
off my royal robes. Then she took my place with my bridegroom,
while I have to do mean service as a Goosegirl. If
my mother knew it she would break her heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old King stood outside by the pipes of the stove, and
heard all that she said. Then he came back, and told her to
go away from the stove. He caused royal robes to be put
upon her, and her beauty was a marvel. The old King called
his son, and told him that he had a false bride&mdash;she was only a
Waiting-woman; but the true bride was here, the so-called
Goosegirl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
The young Prince was charmed with her youth and beauty.
A great banquet was prepared, to which all the courtiers and
good friends were bidden. The bridegroom sat at the head
of the table, with the Princess on one side and the Waiting-woman
at the other; but she was dazzled, and did not
recognise the Princess in her brilliant apparel.</p>

<p>When they had eaten and drunk and were all very merry,
the old King put a riddle to the Waiting-woman. &lsquo;What
does a person deserve who deceives his master?&rsquo; telling the
whole story, and ending by asking, &lsquo;What doom does he
deserve?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The false bride answered, &lsquo;No better than this. He must
be put stark naked into a barrel stuck with nails, and be
dragged along by two white horses from street to street till
he is dead.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is your own doom,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;and the judgment
shall be carried out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the sentence was fulfilled, the young Prince married
his true bride, and they ruled their kingdom together in peace
and happiness.</p>

<h2>The Golden Goose</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a man who had three sons. The
youngest of them was called Simpleton; he was
scorned and despised by the others, and kept in the
background.</p>

<p>The eldest son was going into the forest to cut wood, and
before he started, his mother gave him a nice sweet cake and a
bottle of wine to take with him, so that he might not suffer
from hunger or thirst. In the wood he met a little, old, grey
Man, who bade him good-day, and said, &lsquo;Give me a bit of the
cake in your pocket, and let me have a drop of your wine. I
am so hungry and thirsty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the clever son said: &lsquo;If I give you my cake and wine,
I shan&rsquo;t have enough for myself. Be off with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He left the little Man standing there, and went on his way.
But he had not been long at work, cutting down a tree, before
he made a false stroke, and dug the axe into his own arm, and
he was obliged to go home to have it bound up.</p>

<p>Now, this was no accident; it was brought about by the
little grey Man.</p>

<p>The second son now had to go into the forest to cut wood,
and, like the eldest, his mother gave him a sweet cake and a
bottle of wine. In the same way the little grey Man met him,
and asked for a piece of his cake and a drop of his wine. But
the second son made the same sensible answer, &lsquo;If I give you
any, I shall have the less for myself. Be off out of my way,&rsquo;
and he went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
His punishment, however, was not long delayed. After a
few blows at the tree, he hit his own leg, and had to be carried
home.</p>

<p>Then Simpleton said, &lsquo;Let me go to cut the wood, father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But his father said, &lsquo;Your brothers have only come to harm
by it; you had better leave it alone. You know nothing
about it.&rsquo; But Simpleton begged so hard to be allowed to go
that at last his father said, &lsquo;Well, off you go then. You will
be wiser when you have hurt yourself.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">There stands an old tree; cut it down, and you will find

<p>His mother gave him a cake which was only mixed with
water and baked in the ashes, and a bottle of sour beer. When
he reached the forest, like the others, he met the little grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
Man, who greeted him, and said, &lsquo;Give me a bit of your cake
and a drop of your wine. I am so hungry and thirsty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Simpleton answered, &lsquo;I only have a cake baked in the ashes,
and some sour beer; but, if you like such fare, we will sit down
and eat it together.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they sat down; but when Simpleton pulled out his cake
it was a sweet, nice cake, and his sour beer was turned into good
wine. So they ate and drank, and the little Man said, &lsquo;As you
have such a good heart, and are willing to share your goods, I
will give you good luck. There stands an old tree; cut it
down, and you will find something at the roots.&rsquo;</p>

alt="The crowd of people run along" />
</div>

<p class="caption">So now there were seven people running behind Simpleton and his Goose.</p>

<p>So saying he disappeared.</p>

<p>Simpleton cut down the tree, and when it fell, lo, and
behold! a Goose was sitting among the roots, and its feathers
were of pure gold. He picked it up, and taking it with him,
went to an inn, where he meant to stay the night. The landlord
had three daughters, who saw the Goose, and were very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
curious as to what kind of bird it could be, and wanted to get
one of its golden feathers.</p>

<p>The eldest thought, &lsquo;There will soon be some opportunity
for me to pull out one of the feathers,&rsquo; and when Simpleton
went outside, she took hold of its wing to pluck out a feather;
but her hand stuck fast, and she
could not get away.</p>

<p>Soon after, the second sister
came up, meaning also to pluck out
one of the golden feathers; but
she had hardly touched her sister
when she found herself held fast.</p>

<p>Lastly, the third one came, with
the same intention, but the others
screamed out, &lsquo;Keep away! For
goodness sake, keep away!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But she, not knowing why she
was to keep away, thought, &lsquo;Why
should I not be there, if they are
there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she ran up, but as soon as
she touched her sisters she had to
stay hanging on to them, and they
all had to pass the night like this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="ill20" id="ill20"></a>
<img src="images/ill20.png" width="600" height="271"
alt="The larger crowd follows up and down hills" />
</div>

<p class="caption">And so they followed up hill and down
dale after Simpleton and his Goose.</p>

<p>In the morning, Simpleton took up the Goose under his
arm, without noticing the three girls hanging on behind. They
had to keep running behind, dodging his legs right and left.</p>

<p>In the middle of the fields they met the Parson, who, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
he saw the procession, cried out: &lsquo;For shame, you bold girls!
Why do you run after the lad like that? Do you call that
proper behaviour?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he took hold of the hand of the youngest girl to pull
her away; but no sooner had he touched her than he felt
himself held fast, and he,
too, had to run behind.</p>

<p>Soon after the Sexton
came up, and, seeing his
master the Parson treading
on the heels of the
three girls, cried out in
amazement, &lsquo;Hullo, your
Reverence!
Whither away
so fast? Don&rsquo;t
forget that we
have a christening!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he plucked the Parson by the
sleeve, and soon found that he could not
get away.</p>

<p>As this party of five, one behind the other, tramped on, two
Peasants came along the road, carrying their hoes. The
Parson called them, and asked them to set the Sexton and
himself free. But as soon as ever they touched the Sexton
they were held fast, so now there were seven people running
behind Simpleton and his Goose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
By-and-by they reached a town, where a King ruled whose
only daughter was so solemn that nothing and nobody could
make her laugh. So the King had proclaimed that whoever
could make her laugh should marry her.</p>

<p>When Simpleton heard this he took his Goose, with all his
following, before her, and when she saw these seven people
running, one behind another, she burst into fits of laughter, and
seemed as if she could never stop.</p>

<p>Thereupon Simpleton asked her in marriage. But the King
did not like him for a son-in-law, and he made all sorts of
conditions. First, he said Simpleton must bring him a man
who could drink up a cellar full of wine.</p>

<p>Then Simpleton at once thought of the little grey Man
who might be able to help him, and he went out to the forest
to look for him. On the very spot where the tree that he had
cut down had stood, he saw a man sitting with a very sad face.
Simpleton asked him what was the matter, and he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am so thirsty, and I can&rsquo;t quench my thirst. I hate
cold water, and I have already emptied a cask of wine; but
what is a drop like that on a burning stone?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, there I can help you,&rsquo; said Simpleton. &lsquo;Come with
me, and you shall soon have enough to drink and to spare.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He led him to the King&rsquo;s cellar, and the Man set to upon the
great casks, and he drank and drank till his sides ached, and
by the end of the day the cellar was empty.</p>

<p>Then again Simpleton demanded his bride. But the King
was annoyed that a wretched fellow called &lsquo;Simpleton&rsquo; should
have his daughter, and he made new conditions. He was now
to find a man who could eat up a mountain of bread.</p>

<p>Simpleton did not reflect long, but went straight to the
forest, and there in the self-same place sat a man tightening a
strap round his body, and making a very miserable face. He
said: &lsquo;I have eaten up a whole ovenful of rolls, but what is
the good of that when any one is as hungry as I am. I am
never satisfied. I have to tighten my belt every day if I am
not to die of hunger.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
Simpleton was delighted, and said: &lsquo;Get up and come with
me. You shall have enough to eat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And he took him to the Court, where the King had caused
all the flour in the kingdom to be brought together, and a huge
mountain of bread to be baked. The Man from the forest sat
down before it and began to eat, and at the end of the day the
whole mountain had disappeared.</p>

<p>Now, for the third time, Simpleton asked for his bride.
But again the King tried to find an excuse, and demanded a
ship which could sail on land as well as at sea.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As soon as you sail up in it, you shall have my daughter,&rsquo;
he said.</p>

<p>Simpleton went straight to the forest, and there sat the
little grey Man to whom he had given his cake. The little Man
said: &lsquo;I have eaten and drunk for you, and now I will give
you the ship, too. I do it all because you were merciful to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he gave him the ship which could sail on land as well
as at sea, and when the King saw it he could no longer withhold
his daughter. The marriage was celebrated, and, at the
King&rsquo;s death, the Simpleton inherited the kingdom, and lived
long and happily with his wife.</p>

<h2>The Water of Life</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a King who was so ill that it was
thought impossible his life could be saved. He had
three sons, and they were all in great distress on his
account, and they went into the castle gardens and wept at the
thought that he must die. An old man came up to them and
asked the cause of their grief. They told him that their father
was dying, and nothing could save him. The old man said,
&lsquo;There is only one remedy which I know; it is the Water of
Life. If he drinks of it, he will recover, but it is very difficult
to find.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The eldest son said, &lsquo;I will soon find it&rsquo;; and he went to
the sick man to ask permission to go in search of the Water of
Life, as that was the only thing to cure him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the King. &lsquo;The danger is too great. I would
rather die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But he persisted so long that at last the King gave his
permission.</p>

<p>The Prince thought, &lsquo;If I bring this water I shall be the
favourite, and I shall inherit the kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he set off, and when he had ridden some distance he
came upon a Dwarf standing in the road, who cried, &lsquo;Whither
away so fast?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stupid little fellow,&rsquo; said the Prince, proudly; &lsquo;what
business is it of yours?&rsquo; and rode on.</p>

<p>The little man was very angry, and made an evil vow.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Prince came to a gorge in the mountains, and
the further he rode the narrower it became, till he could go no
further. His horse could neither go forward nor turn round
for him to dismount; so there he sat, jammed in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
The sick King waited a long time for him, but he never came
back. Then the second son said, &lsquo;Father, let me go and find
the Water of Life,&rsquo; thinking, &lsquo;if my brother is dead I shall have
the kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King at first refused to let him go, but at last he gave
his consent. So the Prince started on the same road as his
brother, and met the same Dwarf, who stopped him and asked
where he was going in such a hurry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Little Snippet, what does it matter to you?&rsquo; he said, and
rode away without looking back.</p>

<p>But the Dwarf cast a spell over him, and he, too, got into
a narrow gorge like his brother, where he could neither go
backwards nor forwards.</p>

<p>This is what happens to the haughty.</p>

<p>As the second son also stayed away, the youngest one
offered to go and fetch the Water of Life, and at last the King
was obliged to let him go.</p>

<p>When he met the Dwarf, and he asked him where he was
hurrying to, he stopped and said, &lsquo;I am searching for the
Water of Life, because my father is dying.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you know where it is to be found?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;As you have spoken pleasantly to me, and not been
haughty like your false brothers, I will help you and tell you
how to find the Water of Life. It flows from a fountain in the
courtyard of an enchanted castle; but you will never get in
unless I give you an iron rod and two loaves of bread. With
the rod strike three times on the iron gate of the castle, and it
will spring open. Inside you will find two Lions with wide-open
jaws, but if you throw a loaf to each they will be quiet.
Then you must make haste to fetch the Water of Life before it
strikes twelve, or the gates of the castle will close and you will
be shut in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince thanked him, took the rod and the loaves, and
set off. When he reached the castle all was just as the Dwarf
had said. At the third knock the gate flew open, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
he had pacified the Lions with the loaves, he walked into the
castle. In the great hall he found several enchanted Princes,
and he took the rings from their fingers. He also took a sword
and a loaf, which were lying by them. On passing into the
next room he found a beautiful Maiden, who rejoiced at his
coming. She embraced him, and said that he had saved her,
and should have the whole of her kingdom; and if he would
come back in a year she would marry him. She also told him
where to find the fountain with the enchanted water; but, she
said, he must make haste to get out of the castle before the
clock struck twelve.</p>

<p>Then he went on, and came to a room where there was a
beautiful bed freshly made, and as he was very tired he thought
he would take a little rest; so he lay down and fell asleep.
When he woke it was striking a quarter to twelve. He sprang
up in a fright, and ran to the fountain, and took some of the
water in a cup which was lying near, and then hurried away.
The clock struck just as he reached the iron gate, and it banged
so quickly that it took off a bit of his heel.</p>

<p>He was rejoiced at having got some of the Water of Life,
and hastened on his homeward journey. He again passed the
Dwarf, who said, when he saw the sword and the loaf, &lsquo;Those
things will be of much service to you. You will be able to
strike down whole armies with the sword, and the loaf will
never come to an end.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince did not want to go home without his brothers,
and he said, &lsquo;Good Dwarf, can you not tell me where my
brothers are? They went in search of the Water of Life before
I did, but they never came back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are both stuck fast in a narrow mountain gorge. I
cast a spell over them because of their pride.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Prince begged so hard that they might be released
that at last the Dwarf yielded; but he warned him against
them, and said, &lsquo;Beware of them; they have bad hearts.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadbase" style="width: 416px;">
<a name="pl13" id="pl13"></a>
<img src="images/pl13.jpg" width="416" height="580"
alt="Good Dwarf, can you not tell me where my brothers are?" />
</div>

<p>He was delighted to see his brothers when they came back,
and told them all that had happened to him; how he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
found the Water of Life, and brought a goblet full with him.
How he had released a beautiful Princess, who would wait a
year for him and then marry him, and he would become a great
Prince.</p>

<p>Then they rode away together, and came to a land where
famine and war were raging. The King thought he would be
utterly ruined, so great was the destitution.</p>

<p>The Prince went to him and gave him the loaf, and with
it he fed and satisfied his whole kingdom. The Prince also
gave him his sword, and he smote the whole army of his
enemies with it, and then he was able to live in peace and quiet.
Then the Prince took back his sword and his loaf, and the three
brothers rode on. But they had to pass through two more
countries where war and famine were raging, and each time
the Prince gave his sword and his loaf to the King, and in this
way he saved three kingdoms.</p>

<p>After that they took a ship and crossed the sea. During
the passage the two elder brothers said to each other, &lsquo;Our
youngest brother found the Water of Life, and we did not, so
our father will give him the kingdom which we ought to have,
and he will take away our fortune from us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This thought made them very vindictive, and they made up
their minds to get rid of him. They waited till he was asleep,
and then they emptied the Water of Life from his goblet and
took it themselves, and filled up his cup with salt sea water.</p>

<p>As soon as they got home the youngest Prince took his
goblet to the King, so that he might drink of the water which
was to make him well; but after drinking only a few drops of
the sea water he became more ill than ever. As he was
bewailing himself, his two elder sons came to him and accused
the youngest of trying to poison him, and said that they had
the real Water of Life, and gave him some. No sooner had he
drunk it than he felt better, and he soon became as strong and
well as he had been in his youth.</p>

<p>Then the two went to their youngest brother, and mocked
him, saying, &lsquo;It was you who found the Water of Life; you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
had all the trouble, while we have the reward. You should
have been wiser, and kept your eyes open; we stole it from
you while you were asleep on the ship. When the end of the
year comes, one of us will go and bring away the beautiful
Princess. But don&rsquo;t dare to betray us. Our father will
certainly not believe you, and if you say a single word you will
lose your life; your only chance is to keep silence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old King was very angry with his youngest son, thinking
that he had tried to take his life. So he had the Court
assembled to give judgment upon him, and it was decided that
he must be secretly got out of the way.</p>

<p>One day when the Prince was going out hunting, thinking
no evil, the King&rsquo;s Huntsman was ordered to go with him.
Seeing the Huntsman look sad, the Prince said to him, &lsquo;My
good Huntsman, what is the matter with you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman answered, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to tell you, and yet I
must.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince said, &lsquo;Say it out; whatever it is I will forgive
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said the Huntsman, &lsquo;I am to shoot you dead;
it is the King&rsquo;s command.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince was horror-stricken, and said, &lsquo;Dear Huntsman,
do not kill me, give me my life. Let me have your dress, and
you shall have my royal robes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman said, &lsquo;I will gladly do so; I could never
have shot you.&rsquo; So they changed clothes, and the Huntsman
went home, but the Prince wandered away into the forest.</p>

<p>After a time three wagon loads of gold and precious stones
came to the King for his youngest son. They were sent by the
Kings who had been saved by the Prince&rsquo;s sword and his
miraculous loaf, and who now wished to show their gratitude.</p>

<p>Then the old King thought, &lsquo;What if my son really was
innocent?&rsquo; and said to his people, &lsquo;If only he were still alive!
How sorry I am that I ordered him to be killed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is still alive,&rsquo; said the Huntsman. &lsquo;I could not find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
it in my heart to carry out your commands,&rsquo; and he told the
King what had taken place.</p>

<p>A load fell from the King&rsquo;s heart on hearing the good news,
and he sent out a proclamation to all parts of his kingdom that
his son was to come home, where he would be received with
great favour.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Princess had caused a road to be
made of pure shining gold leading to her castle, and told her
people that whoever came riding straight along it would be the
true bridegroom, and they were to admit him. But any one
who came either on one side of the road or the other would not
be the right one, and he was not to be let in.</p>

<p>When the year had almost passed, the eldest Prince thought
that he would hurry to the Princess, and by giving himself out
as her deliverer would gain a wife and a kingdom as well. So
he rode away, and when he saw the beautiful golden road he
thought it would be a thousand pities to ride upon it; so he
turned aside, and rode to the right of it. But when he reached
the gate the people told him that he was not the true bridegroom,
and he had to go away.</p>

<p>Soon after the second Prince came, and when he saw the
golden road he thought it would be a thousand pities for his
horse to tread upon it; so he turned aside, and rode up on the
left of it. But when he reached the gate he was also told that
he was not the true bridegroom, and, like his brother, was
turned away.</p>

<p>When the year had quite come to an end, the third Prince
came out of the wood to ride to his beloved, and through her
to forget all his past sorrows. So on he went, thinking only of
her, and wishing to be with her; and he never even saw the
golden road. His horse cantered right along the middle of it,
and when he reached the gate it was flung open and the
Princess received him joyfully, and called him her Deliverer,
and the Lord of her Kingdom. Their marriage was celebrated
without delay, and with much rejoicing. When it was over,
she told him that his father had called him back and forgiven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
him. So he went to him and told him everything; how his
brothers had deceived him, and how they had forced him to
keep silence. The old King wanted to punish them, but they
had taken a ship and sailed away over the sea, and they never
came back as long as they lived.</p>

<h2>Clever Grethel</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a cook called Grethel, who wore shoes
with red rosettes; and when she went out in them,
she turned and twisted about gaily, and thought,
&lsquo;How fine I am!&rsquo;</p>

<p>After her walk she would take a draught of wine, in her
light-heartedness; and as wine gives an appetite, she would
then taste some of the dishes that she was cooking, saying to
herself, &lsquo;The cook is bound to know how the food tastes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It so happened that one day her master said to her,
&lsquo;Grethel, I have a guest coming to-night; roast me two fowls
in your best style.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It shall be done, sir!&rsquo; answered Grethel. So she killed
the chickens, scalded and plucked them, and then put them
on the spit; towards evening she put them down to the fire
to roast. They got brown and crisp, but still the guest did
not come. Then Grethel called to her Master, &lsquo;If the guest
does not come I must take the fowls from the fire; but it will
be a thousand pities if they are not eaten soon while they are
juicy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her Master said, &lsquo;I will go and hasten the guest myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had her Master turned his back before Grethel laid
the spit with the fowls on it on one side, and said to herself,
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s thirsty work standing over the fire so long. Who knows
when he will come. I&rsquo;ll go down into the cellar in the meantime
and take a drop of wine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She ran down and held a jug to the tap, then said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s
to your health, Grethel,&rsquo; and took a good pull. &lsquo;Drinking
leads to drinking,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s not easy to give it up,&rsquo;
and again she took a good pull. Then she went upstairs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
put the fowls to the fire again, poured some butter over them,
and turned the spit round with a will. It smelt so good that
she thought, &lsquo;There may be something wanting, I must have
a taste.&rsquo; And she passed her finger over the fowls and put
it in her mouth. &lsquo;Ah, how good they are; it&rsquo;s a sin and a
shame that there&rsquo;s nobody to eat them.&rsquo; She ran to the
window to see if her Master was coming with the guest, but she
saw nobody. Then she went back to the fowls again, and
thought, &lsquo;One wing is catching a little, better to eat it&mdash;and
eat it I will.&rsquo; So she cut it off and ate it with much enjoyment.
When it was finished, she thought, &lsquo;The other must follow,
or the Master will notice that something is wanting.&rsquo; When
the wings were consumed she went back to the window again
to look for her Master, but no one was in sight.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who knows,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;I dare say they won&rsquo;t come
at all; they must have dropped in somewhere else.&rsquo; Then
she said to herself, &lsquo;Now, Grethel, don&rsquo;t be afraid, eat it all
up: why should the good food be wasted? When it&rsquo;s all
gone you can rest; run and have another drink and then
finish it up.&rsquo; So she went down to the cellar, took a good drink,
and contentedly ate up the rest of the fowl. When it had all
disappeared and still no Master came, Grethel looked at the
other fowl and said, &lsquo;Where one is gone the other must follow.
What is good for one is right for the other. If I have a drink
first I shall be none the worse.&rsquo; So she took another hearty
pull at the jug, and then she sent the other fowl after the first
one.</p>

<p>In the height of her enjoyment, her Master came back,
and cried, &lsquo;Hurry, Grethel, the guest is just coming.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, sir, I&rsquo;ll soon have it ready,&rsquo; answered Grethel.</p>

<p>Her Master went to see if the table was properly laid, and
took the big carving-knife with which he meant to cut up the
fowls, to sharpen it. In the meantime the guest came and
knocked politely at the door. Grethel ran to see who was
there, and, seeing the guest, she put her finger to her lips and
said, &lsquo;Be quiet, and get away quickly; if my Master catches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
you it will be the worse for you. He certainly invited you to
supper, but only with the intention of cutting off both your
ears. You can hear him sharpening his knife now.&rsquo;</p>

alt="Then he ran after him, still holding the carving-knife, and cried, 'Only one, only one!'" />
</div>

<p>The guest heard the knife being sharpened, and hurried off
down the steps as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Grethel ran with great agility to her Master, shrieking,
&lsquo;A fine guest you have invited, indeed!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Grethel? What do you
mean?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;he has taken the two fowls that I had
just put upon the dish, and run off with them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a clever trick!&rsquo; said her Master, regretting his
fine fowls. &lsquo;If he had only left me one so that I had something
to eat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He called out to him to stop, but the guest pretended not
to hear. Then he ran after him, still holding the carving-knife,
and cried, &lsquo;Only one, only one!&rsquo;&mdash;meaning that the
guest should leave him one fowl; but the guest only thought
that he meant he was to give him one ear, and he ran as if he
was pursued by fire, and so took both his ears safely home.</p>

<h2>The King of the Golden Mountain</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a Merchant who had two children, a
boy and a girl. They were both small, and not old
enough to run about. He had also two richly-laden
ships at sea, and just as he was expecting to make a great deal
of money by the merchandise, news came that they had both
been lost. So now instead of being a rich man he was quite
poor, and had nothing left but one field near the town.</p>

<p>To turn his thoughts from his misfortune, he went out into
this field, and as he was walking up and down a little black
Mannikin suddenly appeared before him, and asked why he
was so sad. The Merchant said, &lsquo;I would tell you at once, if
you could help me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who knows,&rsquo; answered the little Mannikin. &lsquo;Perhaps I
could help you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Merchant told him that all his wealth had been
lost in a wreck, and that now he had nothing left but this field.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself,&rsquo; said the Mannikin. &lsquo;If you will
promise to bring me in twelve years&rsquo; time the first thing which
rubs against your legs when you go home, you shall have as
much gold as you want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Merchant thought, &lsquo;What could it be but my dog?&rsquo;
He never thought of his boy, but said Yes, and gave the
Mannikin his bond signed and sealed, and went home.</p>

<p>When he reached the house his little son, delighted to hold
on to the benches and totter towards his father, seized him by
the leg to steady himself.</p>

<p>The Merchant was horror-stricken, for his vow came into his
head, and now he knew what he had promised to give away.
But as he still found no gold in his chests, he thought it must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
only have been a joke of the Mannikin&rsquo;s. A month later he
went up into the loft to gather together some old tin to sell it,
and there he found a great heap of gold on the floor. So he
was soon up in the world again, bought and sold, became a
richer merchant than ever, and was altogether contented.</p>

<p>In the meantime the boy had grown up, and he was both
clever and wise. But the nearer the end of the twelve years
came, the more sorrowful the Merchant grew; you could even
see his misery in his face. One day his son asked him what
was the matter, but his father would not tell him. The boy,
however, persisted so long that at last he told him that, without
knowing what he was doing, he had promised to give him up at
the end of twelve years to a little black Mannikin, in return for
a quantity of gold. He had given his hand and seal on it, and
the time was now near for him to go.</p>

<p>Then his son said, &lsquo;O father, don&rsquo;t be frightened, it will be
all right. The little black Mannikin has no power over me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the time came, the son asked a blessing of the Priest,
and he and his father went to the field together; and the son
made a circle within which they took their places.</p>

<p>When the little black Mannikin appeared, he said to the
father, &lsquo;Have you brought what you promised me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The man was silent, but his son said, &lsquo;What do you
want?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Mannikin said, &lsquo;My business is with your father, and
not with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The son answered, &lsquo;You deceived and cheated my father.
Give me back his bond.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&rsquo; said the little man; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t give up my
rights.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They talked to each other for a long time, and at last they
decided that, as the son no longer belonged to his father, and
declined to belong to his foe, he should get into a boat on a
flowing stream, and his father should push it off himself, thus
giving him up to the stream.</p>

<p>So the youth took leave of his father, got into the boat, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
his father pushed it off. Then, thinking that his son was lost to
him for ever, he went home and sorrowed for him. The little
boat, however, did not sink, it drifted quietly down the stream,
and the youth sat in it in perfect safety. It drifted for a long
time, till at last it stuck fast on an unknown shore. The youth
landed, and seeing a beautiful castle near, walked towards it.
As he passed under the doorway, however, a spell fell upon him.
He went through all the rooms, but found them empty, till he
came to the very last one, where a Serpent lay coiling and
uncoiling itself. The Serpent was really an enchanted maiden,
who was delighted when she saw the youth, and said, &lsquo;Have
you come at last, my preserver? I have been waiting twelve
years for you. This whole kingdom is bewitched, and you
must break the spell.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How am I to do that?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>She said, &lsquo;To-night, twelve black men hung with chains
will appear, and they will ask what you are doing here. But
do not speak a word, whatever they do or say to you. They
will torment you, strike, and pinch you, but don&rsquo;t say a word.
At twelve o&rsquo;clock they will have to go away. On the second
night twelve more will come, and on the third twenty-four.
These will cut off your head. But at twelve o&rsquo;clock their power
goes, and if you have borne it, and not spoken a word, I shall
be saved. Then I will come to you, and bring a little flask
containing the Water of Life, with which I will sprinkle you,
and you will be brought to life again, as sound and well as ever
you were.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he said, &lsquo;I will gladly save you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Everything happened just as she had said. The black men
could not force a word out of him; and on the third night the
Serpent became a beautiful Princess, who brought the Water of
Life as she had promised, and restored the youth to life. Then
she fell on his neck and kissed him, and there were great rejoicings
all over the castle.</p>

<p>Their marriage was celebrated, and he became King of the
Golden Mountain.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
They lived happily together, and in course of time a
beautiful boy was born to them.</p>

<p>When eight years had passed, the King&rsquo;s heart grew tender
within him as he thought of his father, and he wanted to go
home to see him. But the Queen did not want him to go. She
said, &lsquo;I know it will be to my misfortune.&rsquo; However, he gave
her no peace till she agreed to let him go. On his departure
she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, &lsquo;Take this ring, and put
it on your finger, and you will at once be at the place where
you wish to be. Only, you must promise never to use it to
wish me away from here to be with you at your father&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He made the promise, and put the ring on his finger; he
then wished himself before the town where his father lived,
and at the same moment found himself at the gate. But the
sentry would not let him in because his clothes, though of rich
material, were of such strange cut. So he went up a mountain,
where a Shepherd lived, and, exchanging clothing with him,
put on his old smock, and passed into the town unnoticed.</p>

<p>When he reached his father he began making himself known;
but his father, never thinking that it was his son, said that it
was true he had once had a son, but he had long been dead.
But, he added, seeing that he was a poor Shepherd, he would
give him a plate of food.</p>

<p>The supposed Shepherd said to his parents, &lsquo;I am indeed
your son. Is there no mark on my body by which you may
know me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>His mother said, &lsquo;Yes, our son has a strawberry mark under
his right arm.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He pushed up his shirt sleeve, and there was the strawberry
mark; so they no longer doubted that he was their son. He
told them that he was the King of the Golden Mountain, his
wife was a Princess, and they had a little son seven years old.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That can&rsquo;t be true,&rsquo; said his father. &lsquo;You are a fine sort
of King to come home in a tattered Shepherd&rsquo;s smock.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His son grew angry, and, without stopping to reflect,
turned his ring round and wished his wife and son to appear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
In a moment they both stood before him; but his wife did
nothing but weep and lament, and said that he had broken his
promise, and by so doing had made her very unhappy. He said,
&lsquo;I have acted incautiously, but from no bad motive,&rsquo; and he
tried to soothe her.</p>

<p>She appeared to be calmed, but really she nourished evil
intentions towards him in her heart.</p>

<p>Shortly after he took her outside the town to the field, and
showed her the stream down which he had drifted in the little
boat. Then he said, &lsquo;I am tired; I want to rest a little.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she sat down, and he rested his head upon her lap, and
soon fell fast asleep. As soon as he was asleep, she drew the
ring from his finger, and drew herself gently away from him,
leaving only her slipper behind. Last of all, taking her child
in her arms, she wished herself back in her own kingdom.
When he woke up, he found himself quite deserted; wife and
child were gone, the ring had disappeared from his finger, and
only her slipper remained as a token.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can certainly never go home to my parents,&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;They would say I was a sorcerer. I must go away and walk
till I reach my own kingdom again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he went away, and at last he came to a mountain, where
three Giants were quarrelling about the division of their
father&rsquo;s property. When they saw him passing, they called
him up, and said, &lsquo;Little people have sharp wits,&rsquo; and asked
him to divide their inheritance for them.</p>

<p>It consisted, first, of a sword, with which in one&rsquo;s hand, if
one said, &lsquo;All heads off, mine alone remain,&rsquo; every head fell to
the ground. Secondly, of a mantle which rendered any one
putting it on invisible. Thirdly, of a pair of boots which
transported the wearer to whatever place he wished.</p>

<p>He said, &lsquo;Give me the three articles so that I may see if
they are all in good condition.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they gave him the mantle, and he at once became
invisible. He took his own shape again, and said, &lsquo;The mantle
is good; now give me the sword.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
But they said, &lsquo;No, we can&rsquo;t give you the sword. If you
were to say, &ldquo;All heads off, mine alone remain,&rdquo; all our heads
would fall, and yours would be the only one left.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last, however, they gave it to him, on condition that he
was to try it on a tree. He did as they wished, and the sword
went through the tree trunk as if it had been a straw. Then
he wanted the boots, but they said, &lsquo;No, we won&rsquo;t give them
away. If you were to put them on and wish yourself on the
top of the mountain, we should be left standing here without
anything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t do that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they gave him the boots too; but when he had all three
he could think of nothing but his wife and child, and said to
himself, &lsquo;Oh, if only I were on the Golden Mountain again!&rsquo;
and immediately he disappeared from the sight of the Giants,
and there was an end of their inheritance.</p>

<p>When he approached his castle he heard sounds of music,
fiddles and flutes, and shouts of joy. People told him that his
wife was celebrating her marriage with another husband. He
was filled with rage, and said, &lsquo;The false creature! She
deceived me, and deserted me when I was asleep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he put on his mantle, and went to the castle, invisible
to all. When he went into the hall, where a great feast was
spread with the richest foods and the costliest wines, the guests
were joking and laughing while they ate and drank. The
Queen sat on her throne in their midst in gorgeous clothing,
with the crown on her head. He placed himself behind her,
and no one saw him. Whenever the Queen put a piece of meat
on her plate, he took it away and ate it, and when her glass was
filled he took it away and drank it. Her plate and her glass
were constantly refilled, but she never had anything, for it
disappeared at once. At last she grew frightened, got up, and
went to her room in tears, but he followed her there too. She
said to herself, &lsquo;Am I still in the power of the demon? Did
my preserver never come?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He struck her in the face, and said, &lsquo;Did your preserver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
never come? He is with you now, deceiver that you are.
Did I deserve such treatment at your hands?&rsquo; Then he made
himself visible, and went into the hall, and cried, &lsquo;The wedding
is stopped, the real King has come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Kings, Princes, and Nobles who were present laughed
him to scorn. But he only said, &lsquo;Will you go, or will you
not?&rsquo; They tried to seize him, but he drew his sword and
said,</p>

<p>&lsquo;All heads off, mine alone remain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then all their heads fell to the ground, and he remained
sole King and Lord of the Golden Mountain.</p>

<h2>Doctor Know-All</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time a poor Peasant, named Crabb, was
taking a load of wood drawn by two oxen to the
town for sale. He sold it to a Doctor for four thalers.
When the money was being paid to him, it so happened that
the Doctor was sitting at dinner. When the Peasant saw how
daintily the Doctor was eating and drinking, he felt a great
desire to become a Doctor too. He remained standing and
looking on for a time, and then asked if he could not be a
Doctor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh yes!&rsquo; said the Doctor; &lsquo;that is easily managed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What must I do?&rsquo; asked the Peasant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;First buy an ABC book; you can get one with a cock as
a frontispiece. Secondly, turn your wagon and oxen into
money, and buy with it clothes and other things suitable for a
Doctor. Thirdly, have a sign painted with the words, &ldquo;I am
Doctor Know-all,&rdquo; and have it nailed over your door.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Peasant did everything that he was told to do.</p>

<p>Now when he had been doctoring for a while, not very long
though, a rich nobleman had some money stolen from him.
He was told about Doctor Know-all, who lived in such and such
a village, who would be sure to know what had become of it.
So the gentleman ordered his carriage and drove to the village.</p>

<p>He stopped at the Doctor&rsquo;s house, and asked Crabb if he
were Doctor Know-all.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you must go with me to get my stolen money back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, certainly; but Grethe, my wife, must come too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The nobleman agreed, and gave both of them seats in his
carriage, and they all drove off together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
When they reached the nobleman&rsquo;s castle the dinner was
ready, and Crabb was invited to sit down to table.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; but Grethe, my wife, must dine too&rsquo;; and he
seated himself with her.</p>

<p>When the first Servant brought in a dish of choice food,
the Peasant nudged his wife, and said: &lsquo;Grethe, that was the
first,&rsquo;&mdash;meaning that the servant was handing the first dish.
But the servant thought he meant, &lsquo;That was the first thief.&rsquo;
As he really was the thief, he became much alarmed, and said
to his comrades outside&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That Doctor knows everything, we shan&rsquo;t get out of this
hole; he said I was the first.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The second Servant did not want to go in at all, but he had
to go, and when he offered his dish to the Peasant he nudged
his wife, and said&mdash;&lsquo;Grethe, that is the second.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This Servant also was frightened and hurried out.</p>

<p>The third one fared no better. The Peasant said again:
&lsquo;Grethe, that is the third.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The fourth one brought in a covered dish, and the master
told the Doctor that he must show his powers and guess what
was under the cover. Now it was a dish of crabs.</p>

<p>The Peasant looked at the dish and did not know what to
do, so he said: &lsquo;Wretched Crabb that I am.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the Master heard him he cried: &lsquo;There, he knows it!
Then he knows where the money is too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Servant grew terribly frightened, and signed to
the Doctor to come outside.</p>

<p>When he went out, they all four confessed to him that they
had stolen the money; they would gladly give it to him and
a large sum in addition, if only he would not betray them to
their Master, or their necks would be in peril. They also
showed him where the money was hidden. Then the Doctor
was satisfied, went back to the table, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, Sir, I will look in my book to see where the money is
hidden.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The fifth, in the meantime, had crept into the stove to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
if the Doctor knew still more. But he sat there turning over
the pages of his ABC book looking for the cock, and as he could
not find it at once, he said: &lsquo;I know you are there, and out
you must come.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The man in the stove thought it was meant for him, and
sprang out in a fright, crying: &lsquo;The man knows everything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Doctor Know-all showed the nobleman where the
money was hidden, but he did not betray the servants; and
he received much money from both sides as a reward, and
became a very celebrated man.</p>

<h2>The Seven Ravens</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a Man who had seven sons, but never a
daughter, however much he wished for one.</p>

<p>At last, however, he had a daughter.</p>

<p>His joy was great, but the child was small and delicate,
and, on account of its weakness, it was to be christened at home.</p>

<p>The Father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to
fetch some water; the other six ran with him, and because
each of them wanted to be the first to draw the water, between
them the pitcher fell into the brook.</p>

<p>There they stood and didn&rsquo;t know what to do, and not one
of them ventured to go home.</p>

<p>As they did not come back, their Father became impatient,
and said: &lsquo;Perhaps the young rascals are playing about, and
have forgotten it altogether.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He became anxious lest his little girl should die unbaptized,
and in hot vexation, he cried: &lsquo;I wish the youngsters would
all turn into Ravens!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words uttered, when he heard a whirring
in the air above his head, and, looking upwards, he saw seven
coal-black Ravens flying away.</p>

<p>The parents could not undo the spell, and were very sad
about the loss of their seven sons, but they consoled themselves
in some measure with their dear little daughter, who soon
became strong, and every day more beautiful.</p>

<p>For a long time she was unaware that she had had any
brothers, for her parents took care not to mention it.</p>

<p>However, one day by chance she heard some people saying
about her: &lsquo;Oh yes, the girl&rsquo;s pretty enough; but you know
she is really to blame for the misfortune to her seven brothers.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
Then she became very sad, and went to her father and
mother and asked if she had ever had any brothers, and what
had become of them.</p>

<p>The parents could no longer conceal the secret. They said,
however, that what had happened was by the decree of heaven,
and that her birth was merely the innocent occasion.</p>

<p>But the little girl could not get the matter off her conscience
for a single day, and thought that she was bound to
release her brothers again. She had no peace or quiet until
she had secretly set out, and gone forth into the wide world
to trace her brothers, wherever they might be, and to free
them, let it cost what it might.</p>

<p>She took nothing with her but a little ring as a remembrance
of her parents, a loaf of bread against hunger, a pitcher of
water against thirst, and a little chair in case of fatigue. She
kept ever going on and on until she came to the end of the
world.</p>

<p>Then she came to the Sun, but it was hot and terrible, it
devoured little children. She ran hastily away to the Moon,
but it was too cold, and, moreover, dismal and dreary. And
when the child was looking at it, it said: &lsquo;I smell, I smell
man&rsquo;s flesh!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then she quickly made off, and came to the Stars, and
they were kind and good, and every one sat on his own special
seat.</p>

<p>But the Morning Star stood up, and gave her a little bone,
and said: &lsquo;Unless you have this bone, you cannot open the
glass mountain, and in the glass mountain are your brothers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl took the bone, and wrapped it up carefully in a
little kerchief, and went on again until she came to the glass
mountain.</p>

<p>The gate was closed, and she meant to get out the little
bone. But when she undid the kerchief it was empty, and she
had lost the good Star&rsquo;s present.</p>

<p>How, now, was she to set to work? She was determined to
rescue her brothers, but had no key to open the glass mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
The good little sister took a knife and cut off her own tiny
finger, fitted it into the keyhole, and succeeded in opening the
lock.</p>

<p>When she had entered, she met a Dwarf, who said: &lsquo;My
child, what are you looking for?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am looking for my brothers, the
Seven Ravens,&rsquo; she answered.</p>

<p>The Dwarf said: &lsquo;My masters, the
Ravens, are not at home; but if you
like to wait until they come, please to
walk in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the Dwarf brought in the
Ravens&rsquo; supper, on seven little plates,
and in seven little cups, and the little
sister ate a crumb or two from each of the
little plates, and took a sip from each of
the little cups, but she let the ring she had
brought with her fall into the last little
cup.</p>

<p>All at once a whirring and crying were
heard in the air; then the Dwarf said:
&lsquo;Now my masters the Ravens are coming
home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they came in, and wanted to eat
and drink, and began to look about for
their little plates and cups.</p>

<p>But they said one after another:
&lsquo;Halloa! who has been eating off my
plate? Who has been drinking out of
my cup? There has been some human
mouth here.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">When she entered

<p>And when the seventh drank to the bottom of his cup, the
ring rolled up against his lips.</p>

<p>He looked at it, and recognised it as a ring belonging to his
father and mother, and said: &lsquo;God grant that our sister may
be here, and that we may be delivered.&rsquo;</p>

As the maiden was standing behind the door listening, she
heard the wish and came forward, and then all the Ravens got
back their human form again.</p>

<p>And they embraced and kissed one another, and went joyfully
home.</p>

<h2>The Marriage of Mrs. Reynard</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once an old Fox who thought that his wife
was not true to him, and determined to put her to
the test. He stretched himself under the bank, lay
motionless, and pretended to be as dead as a door nail. Mrs.
Reynard went to her chamber, and shut herself in; and her
servant, Mistress Cat, sat by the fire, and cooked the dinner.</p>

<p>Now, when it became known that the old Fox was dead,
suitors began to announce themselves. Soon afterwards, the
servant heard some one knocking at the front door. She went
and opened the door, and there stood a young Fox, who said&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;What are ye doing, pray, Mistress Cat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeping or waking? or what are ye at?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not asleep; I&rsquo;m wide awake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">D&rsquo;ye want to know what now I make?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;m warming beer, with butter in it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I beg ye&rsquo;ll taste it in a minute.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged, Mistress,&rsquo; said the Fox. &lsquo;What is
Mrs. Reynard doing?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Maid answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;In chamber sad she sits alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ceases not with grief to moan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She weeps until her eyes are red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the dear old Fox is dead.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Well, just tell her, Mistress, that there&rsquo;s a young Fox here,
who would be glad to woo her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, young gentleman.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Then went the Cat with pit-a-pat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote the door, rat-tata-tat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Pray, Mrs. Reynard, are you in?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outside a wooer waits below!&rdquo;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s he like? I want to know. Has he got nine
such beautiful tails as the late lamented Mr. Reynard?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh dear no,&rsquo; answered the Cat. &lsquo;He has only got one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t have him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mistress Cat went down, and sent the wooer away.</p>

<p>Soon after this there was knocking again, and another Fox
appeared at the door, who wished to pay his addresses to Mrs.
Reynard. He had two tails, but he came off no better than
the first. Afterwards others came, each with one tail more;
but they were all rejected, till at last one came that had nine
tails like old Mr. Reynard.</p>

<p>When the widow heard this, full of joy, she said to the Cat&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Open the gates and doors; be swift.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Mr. Reynard turn adrift.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But when the wedding was about to be celebrated, then old
Mr. Reynard under the bank roused himself, and gave the
whole crew a good drubbing, and sent them, Mrs. Reynard and
all, helter-skelter out of the house.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Second Tale</h3>

<p>When old Mr. Reynard really died, the Wolf came as a suitor,
and knocked at the door, and the Cat who acted as servant to
Mrs. Reynard, opened it.</p>

<p>The Wolf greeted her, and said&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Good-day, Miss Cat, of sprightly wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How comes it that alone you sit?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are you making there, so good?&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Cat answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Tumbling milk and butter up.<br /></span>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
&lsquo;Thank you kindly, Mistress Cat. Mistress Reynard is not
at home, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Upstairs in her chamber she sits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weeps as her sorrow befits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sad case she doth much deplore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because Mr. Reynard&rsquo;s no more.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Wolf answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;&ldquo;If now she wants to wed again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She must come down the stairs, &rsquo;tis plain.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cat ran up without delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did her claws their clatter stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until she reached the long saloon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, tapping with her five gold rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Is Mrs. Reynard in?&rdquo; she sings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;If now she wants to wed again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She must come down the stairs, &rsquo;tis plain.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Reynard asked: &lsquo;Does the gentleman wear red
breeches, and has he a pointed muzzle?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered the Cat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then he is no use to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the Wolf was rejected, there came a Dog, a Stag, a
Hare, a Bear, and one after another every sort of wild animal.
But in every one there was wanting some of the good qualities
which old Mr. Reynard had possessed, and the Cat was obliged
to dismiss the suitors every time. At last there came a young
Fox. Then Mrs. Reynard asked: &lsquo;Does the gentleman wear
red breeches, and has he got a pointed muzzle?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Cat. &lsquo;He has both.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then let him come up,&rsquo; said Mrs. Reynard, and ordered
the maid to make ready the wedding feast.</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Now, Cat, set to and sweep the room.<br /></span>

Then the wedding with young Mr. Fox was held, and there
was merry-making and dancing, and if they haven&rsquo;t stopped,
they are dancing still.</p>

<h2>The Salad</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a merry young Huntsman, who went
into the forest to hunt. He was gay and light-hearted,
and whistled a tune upon a leaf as he went
along.</p>

<p>Suddenly an ugly old Crone spoke to him, and said:
&lsquo;Good morning, dear Huntsman; you are merry and happy
enough, while I am hungry and thirsty. Pray give me an
alms.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman pitied the poor Old Woman, put his hand
in his pocket, and made her a present according to his means.</p>

<p>Then he wanted to go on. But the Old Woman held him
back, and said: &lsquo;Hark ye, dear Huntsman, I will make you a
present because of your good heart. Go on your way, and you
will come to a tree, on which nine birds are sitting. They will
have a cloak in their claws, over which they are fighting.
Take aim with your gun, and shoot into the middle of them.
They will drop the cloak, and one of the birds will fall down
dead. Take the cloak with you, it is a wishing-cloak. When
you throw it round your shoulders you only have to wish yourself
at a place to be there at once. Take the heart out of the
dead bird and swallow it whole, then you will find a gold coin
under your pillow every single morning when you wake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman thanked the Wise Woman, and thought:
&lsquo;She promises fine things, if only they turn out as well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When he had gone about a hundred paces, he heard above
him, in the branches of a tree, such a chattering and screaming
that he looked up.</p>

<p>There he saw a flock of birds tearing a garment with their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
beaks and claws; snatching and tearing at it as if each one
wanted to have it for himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Huntsman, &lsquo;this is extraordinary, it is
exactly what the Old Woman said.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He put his gun to his shoulder, took aim and fired right into
the middle of them, making the feathers fly about.</p>

<p>The birds took flight with a great noise, all except one,
which fell down dead, and the cloak dropped at his feet.</p>

<p>He did as the Old Woman had told him, cut the heart out
of the bird and swallowed it whole. Then he took the cloak
home with him.</p>

<p>When he woke in the morning, he remembered the Old
Woman&rsquo;s promise, and looked under his
pillow to see if it was true.</p>

<p>There, sure enough, lay the golden
coin shining before him, and the next
morning he found another, and the same
every morning when he got up.</p>

<p>He collected quite a heap of gold, and
at last he thought: &lsquo;What is the good of
all my gold if I stay at home here? I
will go and look about me in the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he took leave of his parents,
shouldered his gun, and started off into
the world.</p>

<img src="images/ill25.png" width="128" height="185"
alt="An old woman, wearing a tall hat" />
</div>

<p class="caption">But the Old Woman
was a witch.</p>

<p>It so happened that one day he came
to a thick forest, and when he got through it, he saw a fine
castle lying in the plain beyond.</p>

<p>He saw an Old Woman standing in one of the windows
looking out, with a beautiful Maiden beside her.</p>

<p>But the Old Woman was a witch, and she said to the
Maiden: &lsquo;Here comes some one out of the forest. He has a
wonderful treasure inside him; we must try to get it from him,
my darling, it will suit us better than him. He has a bird&rsquo;s
heart about him, and therefore he finds a gold coin every
morning under his pillow when he wakes.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
She told the girl how he had got it, and at last said: &lsquo;If
you don&rsquo;t get it from him, it will be the worse for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the Huntsman got nearer, he saw the Maiden, and
said: &lsquo;I have been wandering about for a long time, I will go
into this castle and take a rest. I have plenty of money.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the real reason was that he had caught sight of the
pretty picture at the window. He went in, and he was kindly
received and hospitably treated.</p>

<p>Before long, he was so enamoured of the Witch-Maiden that
he thought of nothing else, and cared for nothing but pleasing
her.</p>

<p>The Old Woman said to the Maiden: &lsquo;Now we must get the
bird&rsquo;s heart, he will never miss it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They concocted a potion, and when it was ready they put
it into a goblet.</p>

<p>And the Maiden took it to him, and said: &lsquo;Now, my
beloved, you must drink to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He took the cup and drank the potion, and when he was
overpowered by it the bird&rsquo;s heart came out of his mouth.</p>

<p>The Maiden took it away secretly and swallowed it herself,
for the Old Woman wanted to have it.</p>

<p>From this time the Huntsman found no more gold under
his pillow; but the coin was always under the Maiden&rsquo;s instead,
and the Old Woman used to fetch it away every morning.</p>

<p>But he was so much in love, that he thought of nothing but
enjoying himself in the Maiden&rsquo;s company.</p>

<p>Then the Old Woman said: &lsquo;We have got the bird&rsquo;s heart,
but we must have his wishing-cloak too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Maiden said: &lsquo;Let us leave him that; we have taken
away his wealth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Old Woman was very angry, and said: &lsquo;A cloak like
that is a very wonderful thing, and not often to be got. Have
it I must, and will!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she obeyed the Witch&rsquo;s orders, placed herself at the
window, and looked sadly out at the distant hills.</p>

<p>The Huntsman said: &lsquo;Why are you so sad?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
&lsquo;Alas! my love,&rsquo; was her answer, &lsquo;over there are the garnet
mountains, where the precious stones are found. I long for
them so much that I grow sad whenever I think of them. But
who could ever get them? The birds which fly, perhaps; no
mortal could ever reach them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If that is all your trouble,&rsquo; said the Huntsman, &lsquo;I can soon
lift that load from your heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he drew her under his cloak, and in a moment they
were both sitting on the mountain. The precious stones were
glittering around them; their hearts rejoiced at the sight of
them, and they soon gathered together some of the finest and
largest.</p>

<p>Now the Witch had so managed that the Huntsman began
to feel his eyes grow very heavy.</p>

<p>So he said to the Maiden: &lsquo;We will sit down to rest a while,
I am so tired I can hardly stand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they sat down, and he laid his head on her lap and was
soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>As soon as he was asleep, the Maiden slipped the cloak from
his shoulders and put it on her own, loaded herself with the
precious garnets, and wished herself at home.</p>

<p>When the Huntsman had had his sleep out, he woke up
and saw that his beloved had betrayed him, and left him alone
on the wild mountain.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, what treachery there is in the world!&rsquo; he exclaimed,
as he sat down in grief, and did not know what to do.</p>

<p>Now the mountain belonged to some wild and savage
Giants who lived on it, and before long he saw three of them
striding along.</p>

<p>He quickly lay down again and pretended to be fast asleep.</p>

<p>The first one, as he came along, stumbled against him, and
said: &lsquo;What kind of earthworm is this?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The second said: &lsquo;Tread on him and kill him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the third said: &lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth the trouble. Let him
alone,&mdash;he can&rsquo;t live here; and when he climbs higher up the
mountain, the clouds will roll down and carry him off.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
Then they passed on, and as soon as they were gone, the
Huntsman, who had heard all they said, got up and climbed
up to the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>After he had sat there for a time, a cloud floated over him,
and carried him away.</p>

<p>At first he was swept through the air, but then he was
gently lowered and deposited within a large walled garden,
upon a soft bed of lettuces and other herbs.</p>

<p>He looked around him and said: &lsquo;If only I had something
to eat; I am so hungry. And it will be difficult to get away
from here. I see neither apples nor pears, nor any other fruit,
nothing but salad and herbs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last, however, he thought: &lsquo;At the worst, I can eat some
of this salad; it does not taste very good, but it will, at least,
be refreshing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He picked out a fine head of lettuce, and began eating it.
But he had hardly swallowed a little piece, when he began to
feel very odd, and quite changed. He felt four legs growing,
a big head, and two long ears, and he saw to his horror that he
was changed into an ass.</p>

<p>As he at the same time felt as hungry as ever, and the
juicy salad was now very much to his taste, he went on eating
greedily.</p>

<p>At last he reached another kind of salad, which he had
hardly tasted when he felt a new change taking place, and
found himself back in his human shape.</p>

<p>After this he lay down and slept off his fatigue.</p>

<p>When he woke next morning he broke off a head of the bad
salad, and a head of the good, and thought: &lsquo;These will help
me to regain my own, and also to punish the traitors.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He put the salad into his wallet, climbed over the wall, and
went off to find the castle of his beloved.</p>

<p>After wandering about for a few days, he was fortunate
enough to find it. Then he stained his face, and disguised
himself so that his own mother would not have known him,
and went to the castle to ask for shelter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
&lsquo;I am so tired,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I cannot go any further.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Witch said: &lsquo;Who are you, countryman, and what do
you want?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He answered: &lsquo;I am a messenger from the King. He sent
me to find the rarest salad which grows under the sun. I have
been lucky enough to find it, and I carry it with me. But the
sun is so burning, that I am afraid the tender plant will be
withered, and I don&rsquo;t know if I shall be able to take it any
further.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the Old Witch heard about the rare salad, she felt a
great desire to have some, and said: &lsquo;Good countryman, let
me try the wonderful salad!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;I have two heads with me,
and you shall have one.&rsquo; So saying, he opened his sack, and
handed her the bad one.</p>

<p>The Witch had no suspicions, and her mouth so watered
for the new dish, that she went to the kitchen herself to prepare
it.</p>

<p>When it was ready, she could not wait till it was put upon
the table, but put a few leaves into her mouth at once.</p>

<p>Hardly had she swallowed them, when she lost her human
shape, and ran out into the courtyard, as an old she-ass.</p>

<p>Then the Maid came into the kitchen, saw the salad standing
ready, and was about to put it on the table. But on the way
the fancy seized her to taste it, according to her usual habit,
and she ate a few leaves.</p>

<p>The power of the salad at once became apparent, because
she also turned into an ass, and ran out into the yard to join the
Old Witch, while the dish of salad fell to the ground.</p>

<p>In the meantime the messenger was sitting with the
beautiful Maiden, and as no one appeared with the salad, she
also was seized with a desire to taste it, and said: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what has become of the salad.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Huntsman thought: &lsquo;The plant must have done
its work,&rsquo; and said: &lsquo;I will go into the kitchen and
see.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
As soon as he got downstairs he saw the two asses running
about, and the salad lying on the ground.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is all right!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;two of them are done for.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he picked up the leaves, put them on a dish, and took
them to the Maiden.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am bringing the precious food to you myself,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;so that you may not have to wait any longer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She ate some, and, like the others, was immediately changed
into an ass, and ran out to them in the yard.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">He tied them all together and drove them along till he came to a mill.</p>

<p>When the Huntsman had washed his face so that the
transformed creatures might know him, he went into the courtyard,
and said: &lsquo;Now, you shall be paid for your treachery.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He tied them all together with a rope, and drove them along
till he came to a mill. He tapped at the window, and the
Miller put his head out and asked what he wanted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
&lsquo;I have three bad animals here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that I want to get
rid of. If you will take them and feed them, and treat them as
I wish, I will pay you what you like to ask.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said the Miller. &lsquo;How do you want them
treated?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman said he wanted the old she-ass (the Witch)
to be well beaten three times a day and fed once. The younger
one, which was the Maid, beaten once and fed three times.
The youngest of all, who was the beautiful Maiden, was to be
fed three times, and not beaten at all; he could not find it in
his heart to have her beaten.</p>

<p>Then he went back to the castle and found everything he
wanted in it.</p>

<p>A few days later the Miller came and told him that the old
ass which was to be beaten three times and fed once, was dead.
&lsquo;The other two,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;which are to be fed three times, are
not dead, but they are pining away, and won&rsquo;t last long.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman&rsquo;s heart was stirred with pity, and he told
the Miller to bring them back to him.</p>

<p>When they came he gave them some of the other salad to
eat, so that they took their human shapes again.</p>

<p>The beautiful Maiden fell on her knees before him, and said:
&lsquo;O my beloved, forgive me all the wrong I have done you.
My mother forced me to do it. It was against my own will,
for I love you dearly. Your wishing-cloak is hanging in the
cupboard, and you shall have the bird&rsquo;s heart back too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But he said: &lsquo;Keep it; it will be all the same, as I will
take you to be my own true wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Their marriage was soon after celebrated, and they lived
happily together till they died.</p>

<h2>The Youth who could not Shudder</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a Father who had two sons. One
was clever and sensible, and always knew how to get
on. But the younger one was stupid, and could not
learn anything, and he had no imagination.</p>

<p>When people saw him, they said: &lsquo;His Father will have
plenty of trouble with him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whenever there was anything to be done, the eldest one
always had to do it. But if his Father sent him to fetch anything
late in the evening, or at night, and the way lay through
the churchyard, or any other dreary place, he would answer:
&lsquo;Oh no, Father, not there; it makes me shudder!&rsquo; For he
was afraid.</p>

<p>In the evening, when stories were being told round the fire
which made one&rsquo;s flesh creep, and the listeners said: &lsquo;Oh, you
make me shudder!&rsquo; the youngest son, sitting in the corner
listening, could not imagine what they meant. &lsquo;They always
say &ldquo;It makes me shudder! It makes me shudder!&rdquo; And
it doesn&rsquo;t make me shudder a bit. It must be some art which
I can&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now it happened one day that his Father said to him:
&lsquo;I say, you in the corner there, you are growing big and strong.
You must learn something by which you can make a living.
See what pains your brother takes, but you are not worth your
salt.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, Father,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;I am quite ready to learn
something; nay, I should very much like to learn how to
shudder, for I know nothing about that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The elder son laughed when he heard him, and thought:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
&lsquo;Good heavens! what a fool my brother is; he will never do
any good as long as he lives.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But his Father sighed, and answered: &lsquo;You will easily
enough learn how to shudder, but you won&rsquo;t make your bread
by it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Soon after, the Sexton came to the house on a visit, and the
Father confided his troubles about his son to him. He told
him how stupid he was, and how he never could learn anything.
&lsquo;Would you believe that when I asked him how he was going
to make his living, he said he would like to learn how to
shudder?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said the Sexton, &lsquo;he may learn that from me.
Just let me have him, and I&rsquo;ll soon put the polish on him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Father was pleased, for he thought: &lsquo;Anyhow, the
Lad will gain something by it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Sexton took him home with him, and he had to ring
the church bells.</p>

<p>A few days after, the Sexton woke him at midnight, and
told him to get up and ring the bells. &lsquo;You shall soon be taught
how to shudder!&rsquo; he thought, as he crept stealthily up the
stairs beforehand.</p>

<p>When the Lad got up into the tower, and turned round to
catch hold of the bell rope, he saw a white figure standing on
the steps opposite the belfry window.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo; he cried; but the figure neither moved
nor answered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Answer,&rsquo; cried the Lad, &lsquo;or get out of the way. You
have no business here in the night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But so that the Lad should think he was a ghost, the
Sexton did not stir.</p>

<p>The Lad cried for the second time: &lsquo;What do you want
here? Speak if you are an honest fellow, or I&rsquo;ll throw you
down the stairs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Sexton did not think he would go to such lengths, so
he made no sound, and stood as still as if he were made of stone.</p>

<p>Then the Lad called to him the third time, and, as he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
no answer, he took a run and threw the ghost down the stairs.
It fell down ten steps, and remained lying in a corner.</p>

<p>Then he rang the bells, went home, and, without saying a
word to anybody, went to bed and was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>The Sexton&rsquo;s wife waited a long time for her husband, but,
as he never came back, she got frightened, and woke up the
Lad.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what has become of my husband?&rsquo; she
asked. &lsquo;He went up into the church tower before you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered the Lad. &lsquo;There was somebody standing
on the stairs opposite the belfry window, and, as he would
neither answer me nor go away, I took him to be a rogue and
threw him downstairs. Go and see if it was your husband; I
should be sorry if it were.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The woman hurried away and found her husband lying in
the corner, moaning, with a broken leg. She carried him down,
and then hastened with loud cries to the Lad&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your son has brought about a great misfortune; he has
thrown my husband downstairs and broken his leg. Take the
good-for-nothing fellow away, out of our house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Father was horrified, and, going back with her, gave
the Lad a good scolding.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the meaning of this inhuman prank? The evil
one must have put it into your head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; answered the Lad, &lsquo;just listen to me. I am
quite innocent. He stood there in the dark, like a man with
some wicked design. I did not know who it was, and I warned
him three times to speak, or to go away!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; said his Father, &lsquo;you bring me nothing but
disaster. Go away out of my sight. I will have nothing more
to do with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gladly, Father. Only wait till daylight; then I will go
away, and learn to shudder. Then, at least, I shall have one
art to make my living by.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Learn what you like,&rsquo; said his Father. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all the same
to me. Here are fifty thalers for you. Go out into the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
and don&rsquo;t tell a creature where you come from, or who your
Father is, for you will only bring me to shame.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just as you please, Father. If that is all you want, I
can easily fulfil your desire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At daybreak, the Lad put his fifty thalers into his pocket,
and went out along the high road, repeating over and over to
himself as he went: &lsquo;If only I could shudder, if only I could
shudder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A Man came by and overheard the words the Lad was
saying to himself, and when they had gone a little further, and
came within sight of the gallows, he said: &lsquo;See, there is the
tree where those seven have been wedded to the ropemaker&rsquo;s
daughter, and are now learning to fly. Sit down below them,
and when night comes you will soon learn to shudder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If nothing more than that is needed,&rsquo; said the Lad, &lsquo;it is
easily done. And if I learn to shudder as easily as that, you
shall have my fifty thalers. Come back to me early to-morrow
morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Lad went up to the gallows, and sat down under
them to wait till night came.</p>

<p>As he was cold he lighted a fire, but at midnight the wind
grew so cold that he did not know how to keep himself warm.</p>

<p>The wind blew the men on the gallows backwards and
forwards, and swung them against each other, so he thought:
&lsquo;Here am I freezing by the fire, how much colder they must be
up there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And as he was very compassionate, he mounted the ladder,
undid them, and brought all seven down one by one.</p>

<p>Then he blew up the fire, and placed them round it to warm
themselves.</p>

<p>They sat there and never moved, even when the fire caught
their clothing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take care, or I will hang you all up again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The dead men, of course, could not hear, and remained
silent while their few rags were burnt up.</p>

<p>Then he grew angry, and said: &lsquo;If you won&rsquo;t take care of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
yourselves, I can&rsquo;t help you, and I won&rsquo;t be burnt with
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he hung them all up again in a row, and sat down by the
fire and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Next morning, the Man, wanting to get his fifty thalers,
came to him and said: &lsquo;Now do you know what shuddering
means?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;how should I have learnt it? Those
fellows up there never opened their mouths, and they were so
stupid that they let the few poor rags they had about them
burn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Man saw that no thalers would be his that day,
and he went away, saying: &lsquo;Never in my life have I seen such
a fellow as this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Lad also went on his way, and again began saying to
himself: &lsquo;Oh, if only I could learn to shudder, if only I could
learn to shudder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A Carter, walking behind him, heard this, and asked: &lsquo;Who
are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; answered the Youth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who is your Father?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That I must not say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What are you always mumbling in your beard?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; answered the Youth, &lsquo;I want to learn to shudder,
but no one can teach me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stop your silly chatter,&rsquo; said the Carter. &lsquo;Just you come
with me, and I&rsquo;ll see that you have what you want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Youth went with the Carter, and in the evening they
reached an inn, where they meant to pass the night. He said
quite loud, as they entered: &lsquo;Oh, if only I could learn to
shudder, if only I could learn to shudder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Landlord, who heard him, laughed, and said: &lsquo;If
that&rsquo;s what you want, there should be plenty of opportunity
for you here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will have nothing to say to it,&rsquo; said the Landlady. &lsquo;So
many a prying fellow has already paid the penalty with his life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
It would be a sin and a shame if those bright eyes should not see
the light of day again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Youth said: &lsquo;I will learn it somehow, however
hard it may be. I have been driven out for not knowing it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He gave the Landlord no peace till he told him that there
was an enchanted castle a little way off, where any one could
be made to shudder, if he would pass three nights in it.</p>

<p>The King had promised his daughter to wife to any one
who dared do it, and she was the prettiest maiden the sun had
ever shone on.</p>

<p>There were also great treasures hidden in the castle, watched
over by evil spirits, enough to make any poor man rich who
could break the spell.</p>

<p>Already many had gone in, but none had ever come out.</p>

<p>Next morning the Youth went to the King, and said:
&lsquo;By your leave, I should like to pass three nights in the enchanted
castle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King looked at him, and, as he took a fancy to him, he
said: &lsquo;You may ask three things to take into the castle with
you, but they must be lifeless things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He answered: &lsquo;Then I ask for a fire, a turning-lathe, and a
cooper&rsquo;s bench with the knife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King had all three carried into the castle for him.</p>

<p>When night fell, the Youth went up to the castle and made
a bright fire in one of the rooms. He put the cooper&rsquo;s bench
with the knife near the fire, and seated himself on the turning-lathe.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, if only I could shudder,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but I shan&rsquo;t learn
it here either.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Towards midnight he wanted to make up the fire, and, as he
was blowing it up, something in one corner began to shriek:
&lsquo;Miau, miau, how cold we are!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You fools!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;What do you shriek for? If you
are cold, come and warm yourselves by the fire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, two big black cats bounded up and sat down,
one on each side of him, and stared at him with wild, fiery eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
After a time, when they had warmed themselves, they
said: &lsquo;Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;but show me your paws first.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they stretched out
their claws.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;what
long nails you&rsquo;ve got. Wait
a bit; I must cut them for
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He seized them by the
scruff of their necks, lifted
them on to the cooper&rsquo;s bench,
and screwed their paws firmly
to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 403px;">

<img src="images/ill27.png" width="403" height="430"
alt="The animals run towards the youth" />
</div>

<p class="caption">Crowds of black cats and dogs swarmed out of every corner.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have looked at your fingers, and the desire to play cards
with you has passed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he killed them and threw them out into the moat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
But no sooner had he got rid of these two cats, and was
about to sit down by his fire again, than crowds of black cats
and dogs swarmed out of every corner, more and more of them.</p>

<p>They howled horribly, and trampled on his fire, and tried
to put it out.</p>

<p>For a time he looked quietly on, but when it grew too bad
he seized his cooper&rsquo;s knife, and cried: &lsquo;Away with you, you
rascally pack,&rsquo; and let fly among them right and left. Some
of them sprang away, the others he killed, and threw them out
into the water.</p>

<p>When he came back he scraped the embers of his fire
together again, and warmed himself. He could hardly keep
his eyes open, and felt the greatest desire to go to sleep. He
looked round, and in one corner he saw a big bed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s the very thing,&rsquo; he said, and lay down in it. As soon
as he closed his eyes, the bed began to move, and soon it was
tearing round and round the castle. &lsquo;Very good!&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;The faster the better!&rsquo; The bed rolled on as if it were
dragged by six horses; over thresholds and stairs, up and
down.</p>

<p>Suddenly it went hop, hop, hop, and turned topsy-turvy,
so that it lay upon him like a mountain. But he pitched the
pillows and blankets into the air, slipped out of it, and said:
&lsquo;Now any one may ride who likes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he lay down by his fire and slept till daylight.</p>

<p>In the morning the King came, and when he saw him lying
on the floor, he thought the ghosts had killed him, and he was
dead. So he said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a sad pity, for such a handsome
fellow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Youth heard him, and sat up, saying: &lsquo;It has not
come to that yet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King was surprised and delighted, and asked him how
he had got on.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pretty well!&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;One night is gone, I suppose
I shall get through the others too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the Landlord saw him he opened his eyes, and said:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
&lsquo;I never thought I should see you alive again. Have you
learnt how to shudder now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all in vain. If only some one
would tell me how.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The second night came, and up he went again and sat down
by the fire, and began his old song: &lsquo;Oh, if only I could learn
to shudder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the middle of the night a great noise and uproar began,
first soft, and then growing louder; then for a short time there
would be silence.</p>

<p>At last, with a loud scream, half the body of a man fell down
the chimney in front of him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;another half is wanting here; this is
too little.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The noise began again, and, amidst shrieks and howls, the
other half fell down.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a bit,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll blow up the fire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When this was done, and he looked round, the two halves
had come together, and a hideous man sat in his place.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We didn&rsquo;t bargain for that,&rsquo; said the Youth. &lsquo;The bench
is mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The man wanted to push him out of the way, but the
Youth would not have it, flung him aside, and took his own
seat.</p>

<p>Then more men fell down the chimney, one after the other,
and they fetched nine human shin bones and two skulls, and
began to play skittles.</p>

<p>The Youth felt inclined to join them, and cried: &lsquo;I say,
can I play too?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;ve got any money.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Money enough,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;but your balls aren&rsquo;t quite
round.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he took the skulls and turned them on the lathe till
they were quite round. &lsquo;Now they will roll better,&rsquo; he said.
&lsquo;Here goes! The more, the merrier!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he played with them, and lost some money, but when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
struck twelve everything disappeared. He lay down, and was
soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Next morning the King came again to look after him, and
said: &lsquo;Well, how did you get on this time?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I played skittles,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;and lost a few coins.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you learn to shudder?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not I. I only made merry. Oh, if I could but find out
how to shudder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On the third night he again sat down on his bench, and said
quite savagely: &lsquo;If only I could shudder!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When it grew late, six tall men came in, carrying a bier, and
he said: &lsquo;Hullo there! That must be my cousin who died a
few days ago.&rsquo; And he beckoned and said: &lsquo;Come along,
cousin, come along.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The men put the coffin on the floor, and he went up and took
the lid off, and there lay a dead man. He felt the face, and it
was as cold as ice. &lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I will warm him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he went to the fire and warmed his hand, and laid it
on his face, but the dead man remained cold. He took him
out of the coffin, sat down by the fire, and took him on his
knees, and rubbed his arms to make the blood circulate.</p>

<p>But it was all no good. Next, it came into his head that if
two people were in bed together, they warmed each other. So
he put the dead man in the bed, covered him up, and lay down
beside him.</p>

<p>After a time the dead man grew warm, and began to move.</p>

<p>Then the Youth said: &lsquo;There, you see, cousin mine, have
I not warmed you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Man rose up, and cried: &lsquo;Now, I will strangle
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;are those all the thanks I get? Back
you go into your coffin then.&rsquo; So saying, he lifted him up,
threw him in, and fastened down the lid. Then the six men
came back and carried the coffin away.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot shudder,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;and I shall never learn it
here.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
Just then a huge Man appeared. He was frightful to look
at, old, and with a long white beard.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you miserable wight!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;You shall soon
learn what shuddering is, for you shall die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not so fast,&rsquo; said the Youth. &lsquo;If I am to die, I must be
present.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will make short work of you,&rsquo; said the old monster.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Softly! softly! don&rsquo;t you boast. I am as strong as you,
and very likely much stronger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We shall see about that,&rsquo; said the Old Man. &lsquo;If you are
the stronger, I will let you go. Come; we will try.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he led him through numberless dark passages to a
smithy, took an axe, and with one blow struck one of the anvils
into the earth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can better that,&rsquo; said the Youth, and went to the other
anvil. The Old Man placed himself near to see, and his white
beard hung over.</p>

<p>Then the Youth took the axe and split the anvil with one
blow, catching in the Old Man&rsquo;s beard at the same time.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, I have you fast,&rsquo; said the Youth, &lsquo;and you will be
the one to die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he seized an iron rod, and belaboured the Old Man
with it, till he shrieked for mercy, and promised him great
riches if he would stop.</p>

<p>Then the Youth pulled out the axe and released him, and
the Old Man led him back into the castle, and showed him
three chests of gold in a cellar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One is for the poor,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;one for the King, and one for
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The clock struck twelve, and the ghost disappeared, leaving
the Youth in the dark.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must manage to get out somehow,&rsquo; he said, and groped
about till he found his way back to his room, where he lay
down by the fire and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning the King came and said: &lsquo;Now you must
have learnt how to shudder.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;What can it be? My dead cousin was
there, and an Old Man with a beard came and showed me a lot
of gold. But what shuddering is, that no man can tell me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then said the King: &lsquo;You have broken the spell on the
castle, and you shall marry my daughter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is all very well,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but still I don&rsquo;t know
what shuddering is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The gold was got out of the castle, and the marriage was
celebrated, but, happy as the young King was, and much as
he loved his wife, he was always saying: &lsquo;Oh, if only I could
learn to shudder, if only I could learn to shudder.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last his wife was vexed by it, and her waiting-woman
said: &lsquo;I can help you; he shall be taught the meaning of
shuddering.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And she went out to the brook which ran through the garden
and got a pail full of cold water and little fishes.</p>

<p>At night, when the young King was asleep, his wife took
the coverings off and poured the cold water over him, and all
the little fishes flopped about him.</p>

<p>Then he woke up, and cried: &lsquo;Oh, how I am shuddering,
dear wife, how I am shuddering! Now I know what shuddering
is!&rsquo;</p>

<h2>King Thrushbeard</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a King who had a Daughter. She was
more beautiful than words can tell, but at the same
time so proud and haughty that no man who came to
woo her was good enough for her. She turned away one after
another, and even mocked them.</p>

<p>One day her father ordered a great feast to be given, and
invited to it all the marriageable young men from far and
near.</p>

<p>They were all placed in a row, according to their rank and
position. First came Kings, then Princes, then Dukes, Earls,
and Barons.</p>

<p>The Princess was led through the ranks, but she had some
fault to find with all of them.</p>

<p>One was too stout. &lsquo;That barrel!&rsquo; she said. The next
was too tall. &lsquo;Long and lean is no good!&rsquo; The third was
too short. &lsquo;Short and stout, can&rsquo;t turn about!&rsquo; The fourth
was too white. &lsquo;Pale as death!&rsquo; The fifth was too red.
&lsquo;Turkey-cock!&rsquo; The sixth was not straight. &lsquo;Oven-dried!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So there was something against each of them. But she
made specially merry over one good King, who stood quite at
the head of the row, and whose chin was a little hooked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why!&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;he has a chin like the beak of a thrush.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After that, he was always called &lsquo;King Thrushbeard.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the old King saw that his Daughter only made fun of
them, and despised all the suitors who were assembled, he was
very angry, and swore that the first beggar who came to the
door should be her husband.</p>

<p>A few days after, a wandering Musician began to sing at the
window, hoping to receive charity.</p>

<p>When the King heard him, he said: &lsquo;Let him be brought
in.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
The Musician came in, dressed in dirty rags, and sang to the
King and his Daughter, and when he had finished, he begged
alms of them.</p>

<p>The King said: &lsquo;Your song has pleased me so much, that
I will give you my Daughter to be your wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess was horror-stricken. But the King said:
&lsquo;I have sworn an oath to give you to the first beggar who
came; and I will keep my word.&rsquo;</p>

<p>No entreaties were of any avail. A Parson was brought,
and she had to marry the Musician there and then.</p>

<p>When the marriage was completed, the King said: &lsquo;Now
you are a beggar-woman, you can&rsquo;t stay in my castle any
longer. You must go away with your Husband.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Beggar took her by the hand and led her away, and she
was obliged to go with him on foot.</p>

<p>When they came to a big wood, she asked:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah! who is the Lord of this forest so fine?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;It belongs to King Thrushbeard. It might have been thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If his Queen you had been.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah! sad must I sing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would I&rsquo;d accepted the hand of the King.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After that they reached a great meadow, and she asked
again:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah! who is the Lord of these meadows so fine?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;They belong to King Thrushbeard, and would have been thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If his Queen you had been.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah! sad must I sing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would I&rsquo;d accepted the love of the King.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they passed through a large town, and again she
asked:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah! who is the Lord of this city so fine?&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;It belongs to King Thrushbeard, and it might have been thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If his Queen you had been.&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah! sad must I sing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would I&rsquo;d accepted the heart of the King.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t please me at all,&rsquo; said the Musician, &lsquo;that you
are always wishing for another husband. Am I not good
enough for you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last they came to a miserable little hovel, and she said:</p>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Ah, heavens! what&rsquo;s this house, so mean and small?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This wretched little hut&rsquo;s no house at all.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Musician answered: &lsquo;This is my house, and yours;
where we are to live together.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The door was so low that she had to stoop to get in.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where are the servants?&rsquo; asked the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Servants indeed!&rsquo; answered the Beggar. &lsquo;Whatever you
want done, you must do for yourself. Light the fire, and put
the kettle on to make my supper. I am very tired.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the Princess knew nothing about lighting fires or cooking,
and to get it done at all, the Beggar had to do it himself.</p>

<p>When they had finished their humble fare, they went to
bed. But in the morning the Man made her get up very early
to do the housework.</p>

<p>They lived like this for a few days, till they had eaten up
all their store of food.</p>

<p>Then the Man said: &lsquo;Wife, this won&rsquo;t do any longer; we
can&rsquo;t live here without working. You shall make baskets.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he went out and cut some osiers, and brought them
home. She began to weave them, but the hard osiers bruised
her tender hands.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I see that won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; said the Beggar. &lsquo;You had better
spin; perhaps you can manage that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she sat down and tried to spin, but the harsh yarn soon
cut her delicate fingers and made them bleed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now you see,&rsquo; said the Man, &lsquo;what a good-for-nothing you
are. I have made a bad bargain in you. But I will try to
start a trade in earthenware. You must sit in the market and
offer your goods for sale.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadbase" style="width: 423px;">
<a name="pl20" id="pl20"></a>
<img src="images/pl20.jpg" width="423" height="600"
alt="The Beggar took her by the hand and led her away." />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;if any of the people from my father&rsquo;s
kingdom come and see me sitting in the market-place, offering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
goods for sale, they will scoff at me.&rsquo; But it was no good. She
had to obey, unless she meant to die of hunger.</p>

<p>All went well the first time. The people willingly bought
her wares because she was so handsome, and they paid what she
asked them&mdash;nay, some even gave her the money and left her
the pots as well.</p>

<p>They lived on the gains as long as they lasted, and then the
Man laid in a new stock of wares.</p>

<p>She took her seat in a corner of the market, set out her
crockery about her, and began to cry her wares.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a drunken Hussar came galloping up, and rode
right in among the pots, breaking them into thousands of bits.</p>

<p>She began to cry, and was so frightened that she did not
know what to do. &lsquo;Oh! what will become of me?&rsquo; she cried.
&lsquo;What will my Husband say to me?&rsquo; She ran home, and told
him her misfortune.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who would ever think of sitting at the corner of the market
with crockery?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Stop that crying. I see you are no
manner of use for any decent kind of work. I have been to our
King&rsquo;s palace, and asked if they do not want a kitchen wench,
and they have promised to try you. You will get your
victuals free, at any rate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Princess became a kitchen wench, and had to wait
upon the Cook and do all the dirty work. She fixed a pot into
each of her pockets, and in them took home her share of the
scraps and leavings, and upon these they lived.</p>

<p>It so happened that the marriage of the eldest Princess just
then took place, and the poor Woman went upstairs and stood
behind the door to peep at all the splendour.</p>

<p>When the rooms were lighted up, and she saw the guests
streaming in, one more beautiful than the other, and the scene
grew more and more brilliant, she thought, with a heavy heart,
of her sad fate. She cursed the pride and haughtiness which
had been the cause of her humiliation, and of her being brought
to such depths.</p>

<p>Every now and then the Servants would throw her bits from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
the savoury dishes they were carrying away from the feast, and
these she put into her pots to take home with her.</p>

<p>All at once the King&rsquo;s son came in. He was dressed in silk
and velvet, and he had a golden chain round his neck.</p>

<p>When he saw the beautiful Woman standing at the door,
he seized her by the hand, and wanted to dance with her.</p>

<p>But she shrank and refused, because she saw that it was
King Thrushbeard, who had been one of the suitors for her
hand, and whom she had most scornfully driven away.</p>

<p>Her resistance was no use, and he dragged her into the hall.
The string by which her pockets were suspended broke. Down
fell the pots, and the soup and savoury morsels were spilt all
over the floor.</p>

<p>When the guests saw it, they burst into shouts of mocking
laughter.</p>

<p>She was so ashamed, that she would gladly have sunk into
the earth. She rushed to the door, and tried to escape, but on
the stairs a Man stopped her and brought her back.</p>

<p>When she looked at him, it was no other than King Thrushbeard
again.</p>

<p>He spoke kindly to her, and said: &lsquo;Do not be afraid. I
and the Beggar-Man, who lived in the poor little hovel with
you, are one and the same. For love of you I disguised myself;
and I was also the Hussar who rode among your pots. All this
I did to bend your proud spirit, and to punish you for the
haughtiness with which you mocked me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She wept bitterly, and said: &lsquo;I was very wicked, and I am
not worthy to be your wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But he said: &lsquo;Be happy! Those evil days are over.
Now we will celebrate our true wedding.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The waiting-women came and put rich clothing upon her,
and her Father, with all his Court, came and wished her joy on
her marriage with King Thrushbeard.</p>

<p>Then, in truth, her happiness began. I wish we had been
there to see it, you and I.</p>




<p class="padtop"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span></p>

<h2>Iron Hans</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a King whose castle was surrounded
by a forest full of game. One day he sent a Huntsman
out to shoot a deer, but he never came back.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps an accident has happened to him,&rsquo; said the King.</p>

<p>Next day he sent out two more Huntsmen to look for him,
but they did not return either. On the third day he sent for
all his Huntsmen, and said to them, &lsquo;Search the whole forest
without ceasing, until you have found all three.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But not a single man of all these, or one of the pack of
hounds they took with them, ever came back. From this time
forth no one would venture into the forest; so there it lay,
wrapped in silence and solitude, with only an occasional eagle
or hawk circling over it.</p>

<p>This continued for several years, and then one day a strange
Huntsman sought an audience of the King, and offered to
penetrate into the dangerous wood. The King, however,
would not give him permission, and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not safe, and I
am afraid if you go in that you will never come out again, any
more than all the others.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Huntsman answered, &lsquo;Sire, I will take the risk upon
myself. I do not know fear.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Huntsman went into the wood with his Dog.
Before long the Dog put up some game, and wanted to chase it;
but hardly had he taken a few steps when he came to a deep
pool, and could go no further. A naked arm appeared out of
the water, seized him, and drew him down.</p>

<p>When the Huntsman saw this, he went back and fetched
three men with pails to empty the pool. When they got to the
bottom they found a Wild Man, whose body was as brown as
rusty iron, and his hair hanging down over his face to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
knees. They bound him with cords, and carried him away to
the castle. There was great excitement over the Wild Man,
and the King had an iron cage made for him in the courtyard.
He forbade any one to open the door of the cage on pain of
death, and the Queen had to keep the key in her own charge.</p>

<p>After this, anybody could walk in the forest with safety.</p>

<p>The King had a little son eight years old, and one day he
was playing in the courtyard. In his play his golden ball fell
into the cage. The boy ran up, and said, &lsquo;Give me back my
ball.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not until you have opened the door,&rsquo; said the Wild Man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; I can&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; said the boy. &lsquo;My father has
forbidden it,&rsquo; and then he ran away.</p>

<p>Next day he came again, and asked for his ball. The Man
said, &lsquo;Open my door&rsquo;; but he would not.</p>

<p>On the third day the King went out hunting, and the boy
came again, and said, &lsquo;Even if I would, I could not open the
door. I have not got the key.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the Wild Man said, &lsquo;It is lying under your mother&rsquo;s
pillow. You can easily get it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy, who was very anxious to have his ball back, threw
his scruples to the winds, and fetched the key. The door was
very stiff, and he pinched his fingers in opening it. As soon as
it was open the Wild Man came out, gave the boy his ball, and
hurried away. The boy was now very frightened, and cried
out, &lsquo;O Wild Man, don&rsquo;t go away, or I shall be beaten!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Wild Man turned back, picked up the boy, put him on
his shoulder, and walked hurriedly off into the wood.</p>

<p>When the King came home he saw at once the cage was
empty, and asked the Queen how it had come about. She
knew nothing about it, and went to look for the key, which was
of course gone. They called the boy, but there was no answer.
The King sent people out into the fields to look for him, but all
in vain; he was gone. The King easily guessed what had
happened, and great grief fell on the royal household.</p>

<p>When the Wild Man got back into the depths of the dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
forest he took the boy down off his shoulder, and said, &lsquo;You
will never see your father and mother again; but I will keep
you here with me, because you had pity on me and set me free.
If you do as you are told, you will be well treated. I have
treasures and gold enough and to spare, more than anybody in
the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He made a bed of moss for the boy, on which he went to
sleep. Next morning the Man led him to a spring, and said,
&lsquo;You see this golden well is bright and clear as crystal? You
must sit by it, and take care that nothing falls into it, or it will
be contaminated. I shall come every evening to see if you have
obeyed my orders.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy sat down on the edge of the spring to watch it;
sometimes he would see a gold fish or a golden snake darting
through it, and he guarded it well, so that nothing should fall
into it. One day as he was sitting like this his finger pained him
so much that involuntarily he dipped it into the water. He
drew it out very quickly, but saw that it was gilded, and
although he tried hard to clean it, it remained golden. In the
evening Iron Hans came back, looked at the boy, and said,
&lsquo;What has happened to the well to-day?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing, nothing!&rsquo; he answered, keeping his finger
behind his back, so that Iron Hans should not see it.</p>

<p>But he said, &lsquo;You have dipped your finger into the water.
It does not matter this time, but take care that nothing of the
kind occurs again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Early next morning the boy took his seat by the spring
again to watch. His finger still hurt very much, and he put his
hand up above his head; but, unfortunately, in so doing he
brushed a hair into the well. He quickly took it out, but it
was already gilded. When Iron Hans came in the evening, he
knew very well what had happened.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have let a hair fall into the well,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I will
overlook it once more, but if it happens for the third time,
the well will be polluted, and you can no longer stay with me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On the third day the boy again sat by the well; but he took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
good care not to move a finger, however much it might hurt.
The time seemed very long to him as he looked at his face
reflected in the water. As he bent over further and further to
look into his eyes, his long hair fell over his shoulder right into
the water. He started up at once, but not before his whole
head of hair had become golden, and glittered like the sun.
You may imagine how frightened the poor boy was. He took
his pocket-handkerchief and tied it over his head, so that Iron
Hans should not see it. But he knew all about it before he
came, and at once said, &lsquo;Take that handkerchief off your head,&rsquo;
and then all the golden hair tumbled out. All the poor boy&rsquo;s
excuses were no good. &lsquo;You have not stood the test, and you
can no longer stay here. You must go out into the world, and
there you will learn the meaning of poverty. But as your heart
is not bad, and as I wish you well, I will grant you one thing.
When you are in great need, go to the forest and cry &ldquo;Iron
Hans,&rdquo; and I will come and help you. My power is great,
greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in abundance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the King&rsquo;s son left the forest, and wandered over trodden
and untrodden paths till he reached a great city. He tried to
get work, but he could not find any; besides, he knew no trade
by which to make a living. At last he went to the castle and
asked if they would employ him. The courtiers did not know
what use they could make of him, but they were taken with his
appearance, and said he might stay. At last the Cook took
him into his service, and said he might carry wood and water
for him, and sweep up the ashes.</p>

<p>One day, as there was no one else at hand, the Cook ordered
him to carry the food up to the royal table. As he did not
want his golden hair to be seen, he kept his cap on. Nothing of
the sort had ever happened in the presence of the King before,
and he said, &lsquo;When you come into the royal presence, you must
take your cap off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas, Sire,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I cannot take it off, I have a bad
wound on my head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the King ordered the Cook to be called, and asked how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
he could take such a boy into his service, and ordered him to
be sent away at once. But the Cook was sorry for him, and
exchanged him with the Gardener&rsquo;s boy.</p>

<p>Now the boy had to dig and hoe, plant and water, in every
kind of weather. One day in the summer, when he was working
alone in the garden, it was
very hot, and he took off his
cap for the fresh air to cool
his head. When the sun
shone on his hair it glittered
so that the beams penetrated
right into the Princess&rsquo;s bedroom,
and she sprang up to
see what it was. She discovered
the youth, and called
to him, &lsquo;Bring me a nosegay,
young man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He hurriedly put on his
cap, picked a lot of wild
flowers, and tied them up.
On his way up to the Princess,
the Gardener met him, and
said, &lsquo;How can you take such
poor flowers to the Princess?
Quickly cut another bouquet,
and mind they are the choicest
and rarest flowers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh no,&rsquo; said the youth.
&lsquo;The wild flowers have a
sweeter scent, and will please
her better.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="caption">She immediately clutched at his cap to pull it
off; but he held it on with both hands.</p>

<p>As soon as he went into the room the Princess said, &lsquo;Take
off your cap; it is not proper for you to wear it before me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He answered again, &lsquo;I may not take it off, because I have a
wound on my head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But she took hold of the cap, and pulled it off, and all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
golden hair tumbled over his shoulders in a shower. It was
quite a sight. He tried to get away, but she took hold of his
arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. He took them, but
he cared nothing for the gold, and gave it to the Gardener for
his children to play with.</p>

<p>Next day the Princess again called him to bring her a bunch
of wild flowers, and when he brought it she immediately
clutched at his cap to pull it off; but he held it on with both
hands. Again she gave him a handful of ducats, but he would
not keep them, and gave them to the Gardener&rsquo;s children. The
third day the same thing happened,
but she could not take off
his cap, and he would not keep
the gold.</p>

<p>Not long after this the kingdom
was invaded. The King
assembled his warriors. He did
not know whether they would
be able to conquer his enemies
or not, as they were very powerful,
and had a mighty army.
Then the Gardener&rsquo;s assistant
said, &lsquo;I have been brought up
to fight; give me a horse, and I
will go too.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">He called three times, &lsquo;Iron Hans,&rsquo;
as loud as he could.</p>

<p>The others laughed and said,
&lsquo;When we are gone, find one for yourself. We will leave one
behind in the stable for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When they were gone, he went and got the horse out;
it was lame in one leg, and hobbled along, humpety-hump,
humpety-hump. Nevertheless, he mounted it and rode away
to the dark forest. When he came to the edge of it, he called
three times, &lsquo;Iron Hans,&rsquo; as loud as he could, till the trees
resounded with it.</p>

<p>The Wild Man appeared immediately, and said, &lsquo;What do
you want?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
&lsquo;I want a strong horse to go to the war.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You shall have it, and more besides.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Wild Man went back into the wood, and before long a
Groom came out, leading a fiery charger with snorting nostrils.
Behind him followed a great body of warriors, all in armour,
and their swords gleaming in the sun. The youth handed over
his three-legged steed to the Groom, mounted the other, and
rode away at the head of the troop.</p>

<p>When he approached the battle-field a great many of the
King&rsquo;s men had already fallen, and before long the rest must
have given in. Then the youth, at the head of his iron troop,
charged, and bore down the enemy like a mighty wind, smiting
everything which came in their way. They tried to fly, but
the youth fell upon them, and did not stop while one remained
alive.</p>

<p>Instead of joining the King, he led his troop straight back
to the wood and called Iron Hans again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; asked the Wild Man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take back your charger and your troop, and give me back
my three-legged steed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His request was granted, and he rode his three-legged steed
home.</p>

<p>When the King returned to the castle his daughter met him
and congratulated him on his victory.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was not I who won it,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but a strange Knight,
who came to my assistance with his troop.&rsquo; His daughter
asked who the strange Knight was, but the King did not know,
and said, &lsquo;He pursued the enemy, and I have not seen him
since.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She asked the Gardener about his assistant, but he laughed,
and said, &lsquo;He has just come home on his three-legged horse,
and the others made fun of him, and said, &ldquo;Here comes our
hobbler back again,&rdquo; and asked which hedge he had been
sleeping under. He answered, &ldquo;I did my best, and without me
things would have gone badly.&rdquo; Then they laughed at him
more than ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
The King said to his daughter, &lsquo;I will give a great feast
lasting three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps
the unknown Knight will come among the others to try
and catch it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When notice was given of the feast, the youth went to the
wood and called Iron Hans.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to secure the King&rsquo;s golden apple,&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is as good as yours already,&rsquo; answered Iron Hans.
&lsquo;You shall have a tawny suit, and ride a proud chestnut.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the day arrived the youth took his place among the
other Knights, but no one knew him. The Princess stepped
forward and threw the apple among the Knights, and he was
the only one who could catch it. As soon as he had it he rode
away.</p>

<p>On the second day Iron Hans fitted him out as a White
Knight, riding a gallant grey. Again he caught the apple;
but he did not stay a minute, and, as before, hurried away.</p>

<p>The King now grew angry, and said, &lsquo;This must not be;
he must come before me and give me his name.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He gave an order that if the Knight made off again he was
to be pursued and brought back.</p>

<p>On the third day the youth received from Iron Hans a
black outfit, and a fiery black charger.</p>

<p>Again he caught the apple; but as he was riding off with it
the King&rsquo;s people chased him, and one came so near that he
wounded him in the leg. Still he escaped, but his horse galloped
so fast that his helmet fell off, and they all saw that he had
golden hair. So they rode back, and told the King what they
had seen.</p>

<p>Next day the Princess asked the Gardener about his
assistant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is working in the garden. The queer fellow went to the
feast, and he only came back last night. He has shown my
children three golden apples which he won.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King ordered him to be brought before him. When he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
appeared he still wore his cap. But the Princess went up to
him and took it off; then all his golden hair fell over his
shoulders, and it was so beautiful that they were all amazed
by it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you the Knight who came to the feast every day in a
different colour, and who caught the three golden apples?&rsquo;
asked the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;and here are the apples,&rsquo; bringing
them out of his pocket, and giving them to the King. &lsquo;If you
want further proof, here is the wound in my leg given me by
your people when they pursued me. But I am also the Knight
who helped you to conquer the enemy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you can do such deeds you are no Gardener&rsquo;s boy.
Tell me who is your father?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My father is a powerful King, and I have plenty of gold&mdash;as
much as ever I want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I see very well,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;that we owe you many
thanks. Can I do anything to please you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;indeed, you can. Give me your
daughter to be my wife!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The maiden laughed, and said, &lsquo;He does not beat about the
bush; but I saw long ago that he was no Gardener&rsquo;s boy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then she went up to him and kissed him.</p>

<p>His father and mother came to the wedding, and they were
full of joy, for they had long given up all hope of ever seeing
their dear son again. As they were all sitting at the wedding
feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors flew open, and a
proud King walked in at the head of a great following. He
went up to the Bridegroom, embraced him, and said, &lsquo;I am
Iron Hans, who was bewitched and changed into a Wild Man;
but you have broken the spell and set me free. All the treasure
that I have is now your own.&rsquo;</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
