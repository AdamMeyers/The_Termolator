<p class="pn p1">That <span class="smcap">Charity</span> and disinterested
<span class="smcap">Care</span> for the Souls
of Men, which make so amiable
a Part of your Lordship's
Character, and give a Lustre and
Grace to all those worldly Honours
with which God has dignified
you, and entitle you to
the kindest Wishes, and sincerest
Prayers of all who love our
Lord <span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span>, and long
for the Enlargement of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
Kingdom in the World; do
now embolden me to inscribe
the following Narrative to your
Lordship, as a Testimonial of
my Gratitude, for that repeated
Liberality, whereby you
have testified your Approbation
of our feeble Attempts in
the important Affair here related,
and given your Sanction
to the Plan we have been prosecuting.</p>

<p>And as you have animated
and encouraged our small Beginnings,
when we had most
need of such Countenance and
Assistance; so your Condescention
and Generosity have made
me solicitous how to manifest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
my Gratitude suitably to a Personage
of such Distinction.</p>

<p>But as your Lordship could
propose no other End, besides
that which we were pursuing,
when you thus opened your
Hand for our Assistance therein,
while it was yet small and
obscure; so I may reasonably
suppose, nothing I can return
will give your Lordship more
Satisfaction, than a plain, and
concise Account of the Progress
of it, and our still growing and
encreasing Prospects of those
good Effects, which will be the
only Reward which your Lordship
could have in View.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>And though it be presented
to your Lordship in a very plain
and unfashionable Dress, agreeable
to the Country from
whence it comes, yet I am
perswaded your Lordship will
not despise it on that Account,
since the Dress, plain and unfashionable
as it is, does so
much excel the savage, and
sordid Habit, and Appearance
of those miserable Creatures,
who have so moved your Lordship's
Compassion as to become
the Objects of your Charity
and Beneficence. Nor will
Modesty itself under such endearing
and inviting Expressions
of your Lordship's Condescention
and Goodness, forbid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our reposing Confidence in
you as our Patron, or indulging
the animating Expectation
of future Benefit by your Smiles
on this infant Institution.</p>

<p>May the Blessing of many,
who shall, in the present and
succeeding Generations, reap
the Benefit of your generous
Donations, come upon you.</p>

<p>And that God may graciously
lengthen out your valuable
and important Life, to refresh
the Bowels of his Saints,
and encourage <span class="smcap">THIS</span>, and every
Attempt to make known the
Name of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, "and manifest
the Savour of his Knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>

wait to know where their

best Manner for the Advancement of the
Kingdom of the great Redeemer; and, supposing
there may also be in some, evil Surmisings
about, and a Disposition to discredit a
Cause which they don't love, and have no
Disposition to promote; I have, to gratify the
one, and prevent the Mischiefs of the other,
thought it my Duty to give the Publick a
short, plain, and faithful Narrative of the Original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Design, Rise, Progress, and present
State of the Charity-School here, called <i>Moor's
Indian-Charity School, &amp;c.</i> And I hope there
is need of little or nothing more than a plain
and faithful Relation of Facts, with the
Grounds and Reasons of them, to justify the
Undertaking, and all the Pains and Expence
there has been, in the Prosecution thereof.
And to convince all Persons of Ability, that
this School is a proper Object of their Charity;
and that whatever they shall contribute
for the Furtherance of it, will be an Offering
acceptable to God, and properly bestowed
for the promoting a Design which the Heart
of the great Redeemer is infinitely set upon.</p>

<p>The Considerations first moving me to enter
upon the Design of educating the Children
of our Heathen Natives were such as
these; viz.</p>

<p>The great Obligations lying upon us, as
God's Covenant-People, who have all we
have better than they in a Covenant Way,
and consequently are under Covenant-Bonds
to improve it in the best Manner for the Honour
and Glory of our liberal Benefactor.
And can such Want of Charity to those poor
Creatures, as our Neglect has shewn; and,
our Neglect of that which God has so plainly
made to be the Matter of our Care and Duty;
and that which the Heart of the great Redeemer
is so set upon, as that he never desired
any other Compensation for all the Travail of
his Soul, can it, I say, be without great Guilt
on our Part?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>It has seem'd to me, he must be stupidly
indifferent to the Redeemer's Cause and Interest
in the World; and criminally deaf and
blind to the Intimations of the Favour and
Displeasure of God in the Dispensations of his
Providence, who could not perceive plain Intimations
of God's Displeasure against us for
this Neglect, inscribed in Capitals, on the
very Front of divine Dispensations, from Year
to Year, in permitting the Savages to be such
a sore Scourge to our Land, and make such
Depredations on our Frontiers, inhumanly
butchering and captivating our People; not
only in a Time of War, but when we had
good Reason to think (if ever we had) that
we dwelt safely by them.</p>

<p>And there is good Reason to think, that
if one half which has been, for so many Years
past expended in building Forts, manning and
supporting them, had been prudently laid out
in supporting faithful Missionaries, and School-Masters
among them, the instructed and civilized
Party would have been a far better Defence
than all our expensive Fortresses, and
prevented the laying waste so many Towns
and Villages: Witness the Consequence of
sending Mr. <i>Sergeant</i> to <i>Stockbridge</i>, which
was in the very Road by which they most
usually came upon our People, and by which
there has never been one Attack made upon
us since his going there; and this notwithstanding
there has been, by all Accounts, less
Appearance of the saving Effects of the Gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
there than in any other Place, where so
much has been expended for many Years past.</p>

<p>And not only our Covenant Bonds, by which
we owe our all to God, and our divine Redeemer&mdash;our
Pity to their Bodies in their miserable,
needy State&mdash;our Charity to their
perishing Souls&mdash;and our own Peace, and
Safety by them, should constrain us to it;
but also Gratitude, Duty, and Loyalty to our
rightful Sovereign. How great the Benefit
which would hereby accrue to the Crown of
<i>Great-Britain</i>, and how much the Interests of
His Majesty's Dominions, especially in <i>America</i>,
would be promoted hereby, we can
hardly conceive.</p>

<p>And the Christianizing the Natives of this
Land is expressly mentioned in the Royal
Charter granted to this Colony, as a Motive
inducing His Majesty to grant that Royal Favour
to our Fathers. And since we are risen
up in their Stead, and enjoy the inestimable
Favour granted to them, on this Consideration;
What can excuse our not performing
to our utmost, that which was engaged by,
and reasonably expected from, them? But
that which is of greatest Weight, and should
powerfully excite and perswade us hereto,
are the many Commands, strong Motives,
precious Promises, and tremendous Threatnings,
which fill so great a Part of the sacred
Pages; and are so perfectly calculated to awaken
all our Powers, to spread the Knowledge
of the only true God, and Saviour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
make it as extensive and common as possible.
It is a Work, in which every one in his Place,
and according to his Ability, is under sacred
Bonds to use his utmost Endeavours. But for
Brevity sake, I omit a particular Mention of
them, supposing none have read their Bibles
attentively, who do not know, that this is a
darling Subject of them; and that enough is
there spoken by the Mouth of God himself,
to obviate and silence all the Objections which
Sloth, Covetousness, or Love of the World
can suggest against it; and to assure them it
is not a Course to Penury, and outward Want,
but to Fulness, and worldly Felicity; while
they are at the same Time laying up a Treasure
to be remitted by <span class="smcap">Christ</span> himself, a
Thousand Fold, when he shall <i>say to them on
his Right-hand, come ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you&mdash;For I was
an hungred, and ye gave me Meat</i>, &amp;c. If denying
Food and Raiment, when we have them
in our Power, to supply the bodily Necessities
of the Poor and Needy, does in the Apostle's
Account, evidence, that the Love of God is
wanting in our Hearts; how much more does
the Neglect of the precious Souls of our Fellow-Creatures,
who are perishing for lack of
Vision, when we have such Fulness to impart,
fall below our high Profession of Love to
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>. Can the Objection that there is
extraordinary Expence and Difficulty in accomplishing
it, be esteemed weighty enough
to excuse and justify our Neglect, in a Case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
such Necessity and Importance? And especially
if we consider, there is not so much
necessary hereto, as would render the Attempt
any Thing like an intolerable Burden, or a
Burden to be felt, if those who are concerned
therein, i. e. the Christian World, were in any
Measure united and agreed in it. And considering
further, that the Advantage thereby
to the Crown of <i>Great-Britain</i> (supposing the
Success of Endeavours should be only in Proportion
as have been, the Successes of feeble
Endeavours in Times past) would abundantly
compensate all the Expence, besides all those
temporal and eternal Rewards of such Charity
and Liberality, which are secured in the
many great and precious Promises of God.</p>

<p>These were some of the Considerations
which, I think, had some Influence to my
making an Attempt in this Affair; though I
did not then much think of any Thing more
than only to clear myself, and Family, of partaking
in the public Guilt of our Land and
Nation in such a Neglect of them.</p>

<p>And as there were few or none who seemed
so much to lay the Necessity and Importance
of the Case to Heart, as to exert themselves in
earnest, and lead the Way therein, I was naturally
put upon Consideration and Enquiry
what Methods might have the greatest Probability
of Success; and upon the whole was
fully perswaded that this, which I have been
pursuing, had by far the greatest Probability
of any that had been proposed, viz. by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Mission of their own Sons in Conjunction
with the <i>English</i>; and that a Number of Girls
should also be instructed in whatever should
be necessary to render them fit, to perform the
Female Part, as House-wives, School-mistresses,
Tayloresses, &amp;c. and to go and be with
these Youth, when they shall be hundreds of
Miles distant from the <i>English</i> on the Business
of their Mission: And prevent a Necessity of
their turning savage in their Manner of Living,
for want of those who may do those
Offices for them, and by this means support
the Reputation of their Mission, and also recommend
to the Savages a more rational and
decent Manner of Living, than that which
they are in&mdash;And thereby, in Time, remedy
and remove that great, and hitherto insuperable
Difficulty, so constantly complained of
by all our Missionaries among them, as the
great Impediment in the Way to the Success
of their Mission, viz. their continual rambling
about; which they can't avoid so long as they
depend so much upon Fishing, Fowling, and
Hunting for their Support. And I am more
and more perswaded, that I have sufficient
and unanswerable Reasons to justify this Plan.</p>

<p>
As,<br />
</p>

<p>1. The deep rooted Prejudices they have
so generally imbibed against the <i>English</i>, that
they are selfish, and have secret Designs to
incroach upon their Lands, or otherwise
wrong them in their Interests. This Jealousy
seems to have been occasioned, nourished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and confirmed by some of their Neighbours,
who have got large Tracts of their Lands for
a very inconsiderable Part of their true Value,
and, it is commonly said, by taking the Advantage
of them when they were intoxicated
with Liquor. And also, by unrighteous Dealers,
who have taken such Advantage to buy
their Skins and Furrs at less than half Price,
&amp;c. And perhaps these Jealousies may be,
not a little, increased by a Consciousness of
their own Perfidy and Inhumanity towards the
<i>English</i>. And it seems there is no Way to avoid
the bad Influence and Effects of these
Prejudices, at present, unless it be by the Mission
of their own Sons. And it is reasonable
to suppose their Jealousies are not less, since
the late Conquest in this Land, by which
they are put into our Power, than they were
before.</p>

<p>2. An <i>Indian</i> Missionary may be supported
with less than half the Expence, that will be
necessary to support an <i>Englishman</i>, who can't
conform to their Manner of Living, and who
will have no Dependance upon them for any
Part of it. And an <i>Indian</i> who speaks their
Language, it may reasonably be supposed,
will be at least four Times as serviceable among
them, supposing he be otherwise equally
qualified as one who can communicate to
or receive nothing from them, but by an Interpreter:
He may improve all Opportunities
not only in Public, but, "when he fits in
the House, walks by the Way, when he lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
down, and when he rises up:" And speak
with as much Life and Spirit as the Nature
and Importance of the Matter require, which
is very much lost when communicated by an
Interpreter.</p>

<p>3. Indian Missionaries may be supposed
better to understand the Tempers and Customs
of <i>Indians</i>, and more readily to conform to
them in a thousand Things than the <i>English</i>
can; and in Things wherein the Nonconformity
of the <i>English</i> may cause Disgust, and
be construed as the Fruit of Pride, and an
Evidence and Expression of their Scorn and
Disrespect.</p>

<p>4. The Influence of their own Sons among
them will likely be much greater than of any
<i>Englishman</i> whatsoever. They will look upon
such an one as one of them, his Interest
the same with theirs; and will naturally esteem
him as an Honour to their Nation, and
be more likely to submit patiently to his Instructions
and Reproofs than to any <i>English</i>
Missionary. This is quite evident in the Case
of Mr. <i>Occom</i>, whose Influence among the
<i>Indians</i>, even of his own Tribe, is much greater
than any other Man's; and when he shall
settle and live decently, and in Fashion, among
them, will likely do more to invite
them to imitate his Manner of Living, than
any <i>Englishman</i>.</p>

<p>5. The Acquaintance and Friendship which
<i>Indian</i> Boys from different and distant Tribes and
Places, will contract and cultivate, while together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at School, may, and if they are zealously
affected will, be improved much for
the Advantage and Furtherance of the Design
of their Mission; while they send to, hear
from, or visit one another, confirming the
Things which have been spoken. And this
without so much Ceremony to introduce one
another, as will be necessary in the Case of
<i>English</i> Missionaries; and without the Cumber
and Expence of Interpreters.</p>

<p>6. Indian Missionaries will not disdain to
own English ones, who shall be Associates
with them, (where the <i>English</i> can be introduced)
as elder Brethren; nor scorn to be
advised or reproved, counselled or conducted
by them; especially so long as they shall be
so much dependent upon the <i>English</i> for their
Support; which will likely be till God has
made them his People; and then, likely, they
will not stand in such need of <i>English</i> Guides
and Counsellors. And they will mutually
help one another, to recommend the Design
to the favourable Reception and good Liking
of the Pagans, remove their Prejudices, conciliate
their Friendship, and induce them to
repose due Confidence in the <i>English</i>.</p>

<p>7. In this School, Children of different Nations
may, and easily will learn one another's
Language, and English Youth may learn of
them; and so save the vast Expence and
Trouble of Interpreters; and their Ministry
be much more acceptable and edifying to the
<i>Indians</i>. But,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>8. There is no such thing as sending
<i>English</i> Missionaries, or setting up and maintaining
<i>English</i> Schools to any good Purpose,
in most Places among them, as their Temper,
State and Condition have been and still are.
It is possible a School may be maintained to
some good Purpose, at <i>Onohoquagee</i>, where
there have been heretofore several faithful
Missionaries, by the Blessing of God upon
whose Labours the <i>Indians</i> are in some Measure
civilized, some of them baptized, a Number
of them in a Judgment of Charity, real
Christians; and where they have a Sachem,
who is a Man of Understanding, Virtue, Steadiness,
and entirely friendly to the Design of
propagating the Gospel among them, and
zealous to promote it. And where the Hon.
<i>Scotch</i> Commissioners, I hear, have sent two
Missionaries, and have made some Attempt to
set up a School. But at <i>Jeningo</i>, a little beyond,
they will by no means admit an <i>English</i>
Missionary to reside among them. And tho'
they were many of them under great Awakenings
and Concern, by God's Blessing on
the Labours of a Christian <i>Indian</i> from these
Parts; yet such was the violent Opposition
of Numbers among them, that it was thought
by no means safe for an <i>Englishman</i> to go among
them, with Design to tarry with them.
And like to this is the Case with the Parties
of <i>Indians</i>, for near an hundred Miles together,
on the West Side of <i>Susquehanah</i> River. Another
School or two may possibly be set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with Success among the <i>Mohawks</i>, where
Mr. <i>Ogilvie</i> and other Episcopal Missionaries
have bestowed much Labour, to good Purpose;
and where they have got into the Way
of cultivating their Lands for a Living, and
so have more Ability to support their Children,
and less Occasion to ramble abroad with
them. But even in these Places we may find
it more difficult than we imagine before the
Trial be made (though I would by no means
discourage the Trial of every feasible Method
for the accomplishing this great Design) but
by Acquaintance with the Schools which the
Hon. <i>London</i> Commissioners have with pious
Zeal, set up and maintained among the several
Tribes in these Parts, I am much confirmed
in such Sentiments. These Parties live
amongst, and are encompassed by the <i>English</i>,
have long had good Preaching, and Numbers
of them appear to be truly godly. Yet such
is the savage Temper of many, their want of
due Esteem for Learning, and Gratitude to
their Benefactors, and especially their want of
Government, that their School-Masters, tho'
skilful and faithful Men, constantly complain
they can't keep the Children in any Measure
constant at School. Mr. <i>Clelland</i> the School-Master
at <i>Mohegan</i> has often told me what
unwearied Pains he has taken by visiting, and
discoursing with their Parents, &amp;c. to remedy
this Evil, and after all can't accomplish it.
The Children are suffered to neglect their Attendance
on Instruction, and waste much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Time, by which means they don't learn so
much in several Years as they might, and others
do in one, who are taken out of the
reach of their Parents, and out of the way of
<i>Indian</i> Examples, and are kept to School under
good Government and constant Instruction.
I the rather mention this Instance, because
of the well-known Fidelity and Skill of
that good Gentleman, and because that Tribe
are as much civilized, and as many of them
Christianized, as perhaps any Party of them
in this Government. And by all I can learn,
it is no better in this respect with any other.
They are so disaffected towards a good and
necessary Government, that as gentle an Exercise
of it as may be, and answer the Design
of keeping up Order and Regularity in any
Measure among them, will likely so disgust
them as to render the Case worse rather than
better. Captain <i>Martin Kellog</i> complain'd of
this as his great Discouragement in the School
at <i>Stockbridge</i>, notwithstanding he understood
as well as any Man the Disposition of <i>Indians</i>,
and had the Advantage of knowing their
Language and Customs, having been so long
a Captive among them, and was high in their
Affection and Esteem; yet he was obliged to
take the Children home to <i>Weathersfield</i> with
him, quite away from their Parents, before
he could exercise that Government which was
necessary in order to their profiting at School.
But as to most Places, there is no such thing
at present as introducing either <i>English</i> School-Masters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
or Missionaries to continue with
them; such are their Prejudices in general,
and such the malevolent, and ungovernable
Temper of some, that none but an <i>Indian</i>
would dare venture his Life among them.</p>

<p>And besides all this, they are so extremely
poor, and depend so much upon Hunting
for a Livelihood, that they are in no Capacity
to support their Children at School, if their
Disposition for it were ever so good.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Occom</i> informed me by a Letter from
the <i>Oneida</i> Country last Summer, and the
same Account I had also from the young Man
which I sent there, that the <i>Indians</i> were almost
starved, having nothing to live upon
but what they got by Fishing, Fowling and
Hunting, that he had no other Way to come
at them, to preach to them, but by following
them from Place to Place in their Hunting.
And though the Condition of all may not be
quite so indigent as of these, nor the Condition
of these at all Times quite so bad as it
was then, yet it is well known that they universally
depend upon Roving and Hunting
mainly for their Support; and whoever has
heard the constant Complaint of Missionaries,
and the Matter of their Discouragement, or has
only read what the Reverend Messi'rs. <i>Sergeant</i>
and <i>D. Brainerd</i> have wrote upon this Head,
can't charge me with writing without sufficient
Evidence, and good Authority, if I had no
other but theirs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>And what are a few Instances, where
Schools may possibly be maintained to some
good Purpose, compared with those Tribes
and Nations of them, where there are no
Circumstances at present, but their Misery
and Necessity, to invite us so much as to
make the Trial.</p>

<p>By the Blessing of God on his late Majesty's
Arms, there is now, no doubt, a Door opened
for a hundred Missionaries; and (unless
we can find such as can speak to them in
their own Language) for as many Interpreters;
and perhaps for ten Times that Number,
provided we could find such as are suitable
for the Business, and such as may be introduced
in a Way agreeable to the Savages, and
so as to avoid the bad Effects of their Prejudices
against the <i>English</i>. But,</p>

<p>9. There are very few or no Interpreters,
who are suitable and well-accomplished for
the Business, to be had. Mr. <i>Occom</i> found
great Difficulty last Year in his Mission on this
Account. And not only the Cause, but his
own Reputation suffered much by the Unfaithfulness
of the Man he employed.</p>

<p>I suppose the Interpreters now employed
by the Hon. Commissioners are the best that
are to be had at present. But how many
Nations are there for whom there is no Interpreter
at all, except, it may be, some ignorant
and perhaps vicious Person, who has
been their Captive, and whom it is utterly
unsafe to trust in Matters of such eternal Consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
And how shall this Difficulty be
remedied? It seems it must be by one of these
two Ways, viz. either their Children must
come to us, or ours go to them. But who
will venture their Children with them, unless
with some of the civilized Parties, who have
given the strongest Testimonies of their
Friendship? If it be said, that all the Natives
are now at Peace with us: It may be, their
Chiefs, and the better-temper'd Part of them
are so. But who does not know that their
Leagues and Covenants with us are little
worth, and like to be so till they become
Christians? And that the tender Mercies of
many of them are Cruelty? Who is so unacquainted
with the History of them, as not to
know, there is Reason to think, there are
many among their lawless Herds, who would
gladly embrace an Opportunity to commit a
secret Murder on such <i>English</i> Youth?&mdash;Even
Mr. <i>Occom</i>, though an <i>Indian</i>, did not think it
safe for him, being of another Tribe and
Language, and in such Connections with the
<i>English</i>, to go among the numerous Tribe of
the <i>Seneca</i>'s, where he had no Avenger of his
Blood for them to fear.</p>

<p>When, and as soon as the Method proposed
by the Rev'd Mess. <i>Sergeant</i> and <i>Brainerd</i>,
can be put into Execution, viz. to have
Lands appropriated to the Use of <i>Indian</i>
Schools, and prudent skilful Farmers, or
Tradesmen, to lead and instruct the Boys,
and Mistresses to instruct the Girls in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Manufactures as are proper for them, at certain
Hours, as a Diversion from their School
Exercises, and the Children taken quite away
from their Parents, and the pernicious Influence
of <i>Indian</i> Examples, there may be some
good Prospect of great Advantage by Schools
among them.</p>

<p>And must it be esteemed a wild Imagination,
if it be supposed that well-instructed,
sober, religious <i>Indians</i>, may with special Advantage
be employed as Masters and Mistresses
in such Schools; and that the Design will be
much recommended to the <i>Indians</i> thereby;
and that there may be special Advantage by
such, serving as occasional Interpreters for
Visitors from different Nations from Time to
Time; and they hereby receive the fullest
Conviction of the Sincerity of our Intentions,
and be confirmed and established in friendly
Sentiments of us, and encouraged to send
their Children, &amp;c.?</p>

<p>I am fully perswaded from the Acquaintance
I have had with them, it will be found,
whenever the Trial shall be made, to be very
difficult if not impossible, unless the Arm of
the Lord should be revealed in an eminent
Manner, to cure them of such savage and
sordid Practices, as they have been inured to
from their Mother's Womb, and form their
Minds and Manners to proper Rules of Virtue,
Decency and Humanity, while they are
daily under the pernicious Influence of their
Parents Example, and their many Vices made
familiar thereby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>10. I have found by Experience, there
may be a thorough and effectual Exercise of
Government in such a School, and as severe
as shall be necessary, without Opposition
from, or Offence taken by, any. And who
does not know, that Evils so obstinate as
those we may reasonably expert to find common
in the Children of Savages, will require
that which is severe? Sure I am, they must
find such as have better Natures, or something
more effectually done to subdue their vicious
Inclinations, than most I have been concerned
with, if it be not so. And moreover, in
such a School, there will be the best Opportunity
to know who has such a Genius and
Disposition, as most invite to bestow extraordinary
Expence to fit them for special Usefulness.</p>

<p>11. We have the greatest Security we can
have, that when they are educated and fitted
for it, they will be employed in that Business.
There is no likelihood at all that they will,
though ever so well qualified, get into Business,
either as School-Masters or Ministers,
among the <i>English</i>; at least till the Credit of
their Nations be raised many Degrees above
what it now is, and consequently they can't
be employed as will be honorable for them,
or in any Business they will be fit for, but among
their own Nation. And it may reasonably
be supposed, their Compassion towards
their "Brethren according to the Flesh" will
most naturally incline them to, and determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
them upon such an Employment as they were
fitted and designed for. And besides all this,
abundant Experience has taught us, that such
a change of Diet, and manner of Living as
Missionaries must generally come into, will
not consist with the Health of many <i>Englishmen</i>.
And they will be obliged on that Account
to leave the Service, though otherwise
well disposed to it. Nor can this Difficulty
be avoided at present (certainly not without
great Expence.) But there is no great Danger
or Difficulty in this Respect as to <i>Indians</i>,
who will only return to what they were used
to from their Mother's Womb.</p>

<p>And there may also be admitted into this
School, promising <i>English</i> Youth of pregnant
Parts, and who from the best Principles, and
by the best Motives, are inclined to devote
themselves to that Service; and who will naturally
care for their State.</p>

<p>Divine Skill in Things spiritual, pure and
fervent Zeal for the Salvation of Souls, shining
Examples of Piety and Godliness, by
which Pagans will form their first Notions of
Religion, rather than from any Thing that
shall be said to them, are most necessary Qualifications
in a Missionary; and promise more
real Good than is to be expected from many
Times the Number who have never "known
the Terrors of the Lord," and have no experimental,
and therefore no right Understanding
of the Nature of Conversion and the Way
wherein it is wrought. Such were never under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the governing Influence of a real Sense
of the Truth, Reality, Greatness and Importance
of eternal Things, and therefore will
not be likely to treat them suitable to the Nature
and eternal Consequences of them, surely
they will not naturally do it. And how sad
are like to be the Consequences to those who
are watching to see whether the Preacher
himself does really believe the Things which
he speaks.</p>

<p>In such a School their Studies may be directed
with a special View to the Design of
their Mission. Several Parts of Learning,
which have no great Subserviency to it, and
which will consume much Time, may be less
pursued, and others most necessary made their
chief Study. And they may not only learn
the Pagan Languages, but will naturally get
an Understanding of their Tempers, and many
of their Customs, which must needs be
useful to Missionaries. And instead of a delicate
Manner of Living, they may by Degrees,
as their Health will bear, enure themselves to
such a Way of Living as will be most convenient
for them to come into when on their
Mission.</p>

<p>And if the one half of the <i>Indian</i> Boys thus
educated shall prove good and useful Men,
there will be no Reason to regret our Toil and
Expence for the whole. And if God shall
deny his Blessing on our Endeavours, as to
the general Design, it may be these particular
Youth may reap eternal Advantage by what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
we do for them; and if but one in ten does
so, we shall have no Cause to think much of
the Expence. And if a Blessing be denied to
all, "we shall notwithstanding be unto God
a sweet Savour of Christ in them that perish."</p>

<p>After the Trial I made of this Nature
some Years ago, by the Assistance of the
Honourable <span class="smcap">London</span> Commissioners, in
the Education of Mr. <i>Samson Occom</i>, one
of the <i>Mohegan</i> Tribe, who has several
Years since been a useful School-Master and
successful Preacher of the Gospel to the <i>Indians</i>
at <i>Montauk</i> on <i>Long-Island</i>, where he took the
Place of the Rev. Mr. <i>Horton</i>, Missionary;
and was, under God, instrumental to cure
them, in a good Measure, of the Wildness
they had been led into by some Exhorters
from <i>New-England</i>, and in a Judgment of
Charity was the Instrument of saving Good
to a Number of them. He was several Years
ago ordained to the sacred Ministry by the Reverend
Presbytery of <i>Suffolk</i> County on said
Island; and has done well, so far as I have
heard, as a Missionary to the <i>Oneida</i> Nation, for
two Years past. May God mercifully preserve
him, amidst loud Applauses, from falling into
the Snare and Condemnation of the Devil!&mdash;I
say, after seeing the Success of this Attempt,
I was more encouraged to hope that such a
Method might be very successful.</p>

<p>With these Views of the Case, and from
such Motives as have been mentioned, above
Eight Years ago I wrote to the Reverend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
<i>John Brainerd</i>, Missionary in <i>New-Jersey</i>, desiring
him to send me two likely Boys for this
Purpose, of the <i>Deleware</i> Tribe: He accordingly
sent me <i>John Pumshire</i> in the 14th,
and <i>Jacob Woolley</i> in the 11th Years of their
Age; they arrived here <i>December 18th. 1754</i>,
and behaved as well as could be reasonably
expected; <i>Pumshire</i> made uncommon Proficiency
in Writing. They continued with
me till they had made considerable Progress
in the Latin and Greek Tongues; when
<i>Pumshire</i> began to decline, and by the Advice
of Physicians, I sent him back to his
Friends, with Orders, if his Health would
allow it, to return with two more of that
Nation, whom Mr. <i>Brainerd</i> had at my Desire
provided for me. <i>Pumshire</i> set out on
his Journey, <i>November 14th. 1756</i>, and got
Home, but soon died. And on <i>April 9th.
1757</i>, <i>Joseph Woolley</i> and <i>Hezekiah Calvin</i>
came on the Horse which <i>Pumshire</i> rode.</p>

<p>The Decline and Death of this Youth was
an instructive Scene to me, and convinced
me more fully of the Necessity of special Care
respecting their Diet; and that more Exercise
was necessary for them, especially at their
first coming to a full Table, and with so keen
an Appetite, than was ordinarily necessary for
<i>English</i> Youth. And with the Exercise of
such Care, as one who understands the Case,
and is willing to take the Trouble of it, may
use, I am persuaded there is no more Danger
of their Studies being fatal to them, than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
our own Children. There have been several
long Fits of Sickness of one and another in
this School, with a nervous Fever, Pleurisies,
Dysenterys &amp;c. but perhaps not more than
have been among so large a Number of common
labouring People in so long a Time.</p>

<p>Sometime after those Boys came, the
Affair appearing with an agreeable Aspect, it
being then a Time of profound Peace in this
Country, I represented the Affair to Colonel
<i>Elisha Williams</i>, Esq; late Rector of <i>Yale-College</i>,
and to the Rev'd Messi'rs <i>Samuel Moseley</i>
of <i>Windham</i>, and <i>Benjamin Pomeroy</i> of <i>Hebron</i>,
and invited them to join me; they readily
accepted the Invitation; and a Gentleman
learned in the Law supposed there might be
such an Incorporation among ourselves as
might fully answer our Purpose. And Mr.
<i>Joshua Moor</i>, late of <i>Mansfield</i>, deceased, appeared
to give a small Tenement in this Place,
for the Foundation, Use and Support of a
Charity-School, for the Education of <i>Indian</i>
Youth, &amp;c. But it pleased God to take the
good Colonel from an unthankful World soon
after the Covenant was made and executed,
and thus deprived us of the Benefit of his singular
Learning, Piety and Zeal in the Affair.
Notwithstanding, a Subscription was soon made
of near <i>£</i>.500 lawful Money, towards a Fund
for the Support of it at 6 per Cent. But several
Gentlemen of the Law, doubting of the
Validity and Sufficiency of such an Incorporation;
several Steps were taken to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Royal Favour of a Charter, but none effectual.
The War soon commenced, and
the Reports from Day to Day of the Ravages
made, and Inhumanities and Butcheries committed
by the Savages on all Quarters, raised
in the Breasts of great Numbers, a Temper so
warm, and so contrary to Charity, that I
seldom thought it prudent so much as to mention
the Affair. Many advised me to drop
it, but it appeared to others so probable to
be the very Method which God would own,
that I thought better to scrabble along with
it, as well as I could, till divine Providence
should change the Scene.</p>

<p>The Prospects, notwithstanding our outward
Troubles, seemed to be increasing:
Such was the orderly and good Behaviour of
the Boys, through the Blessing of God on Instruction
and Discipline, that Enemies could
find but little or nothing that was true
wherewith they might reproach the Design;
and those whose Sentiments were friendly,
observed with Pleasure the good Effects of
our Endeavours: And the Liberalities, especially
of Gentlemen of Character, encouraged
me more and more to believe it to be of God,
and that he designed to succeed and prosper
it, to the Glory of his own great Name; and
that I ought in Compliance with such Intimations
of Providence from Time to Time,
proportionably to increase the Number.</p>

<p>I have had two upon my Hands since
<i>December 18th. 1754</i>, and Four since <i>April,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
1757</i>, and Five since <i>April 1759</i>, and Seven
since <i>November, 1760</i>, and Eleven since
<i>August 1st. 1761</i>, and after this Manner they
have encreased as I could obtain those who
appeared promising. And for some Time I
have had Twenty-five devoted to School as
constantly as their Health will allow, and
they have all along been so, excepting that
in an extraordinary Croud of Business, I have
sometimes required their Assistance. But
there is no great Advantage, excepting to
themselves, to be expected from their Labour,
nor enough to compensate the Trouble of
instructing them in it, and the Repair of the
Mischiefs they will do, while they are ignorant
of all the Affairs of Husbandry, and the
Use of Tools. The principal Advantage I
have ever had in this Respect has been by
<i>David Fowler</i> and <i>Joseph Woolley</i>, and more
by <i>David</i> than all the rest: These Lads will
likely make good Farmers, if they should
ever have the Advantage of Experience in it.</p>

<p>Three of this Number are <i>English</i> Youth,
one of which is gone for a Time to <i>New-Jersey</i>
College, for the sake of better Advantage
for some Parts of Learning: He has made
some Proficiency in the <i>Mohawk</i> Tongue:
The other two are fitting for the Business of
Missionaries. One of the <i>Indian</i> Lads is <i>Jacob
Woolley</i>, who is now in his last Year at <i>New-Jersey</i>
College, and is a good Scholar; he is
here by the Leave and Order of the President,
designing to get some Acquaintance with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<i>Mohawk</i> Tongue. Two others are sent here
by the Rev. Mr. <i>Brainera</i>, and are designed for
Trades; the one for a Blacksmith (a Trade
much wanted among the <i>Indians</i>) and is to
go to his Apprenticeship as soon as a good
Place is ready for him; the other is designed
for a Carpenter and Joiner, and is to
go to an Apprenticeship as soon as he has
learned to read and write. Another of the
<i>Indians</i> is Son to the Sachem at <i>Mohegan</i>, and
is Heir-aparent; he is somewhat infirm as to
his bodily Health: For his Support last Year
I have charged nothing more than 10l. lawful
Money, granted by the Hon. <i>London</i> Commissioners.
Several of my Scholars are considerably
well accomplished for School Masters,
and 7 or 8 will likely be well fitted for
Interpreters in a few Years more. And four
of this Number are Girls, whom I have hired
Women in this Neighbourhood to instruct in
all the Arts of good Housewifery, they attending
the School one Day in a Week to be instructed
in writing, &amp;c. till they shall be fit
for an Apprenticeship, to be taught to make
Men's and Women's Apparel, &amp;c. in order
to accompany these Boys, when they shall
have Occasion for such Assistance in the Business
of their Mission.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And six of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
are <i>Mohawks</i>, obtained pursuant and according
to the Direction of the Honorable General
Assembly of the Province of the <i>Massachusetts-Bay</i>,
and are learning to speak, write,
and read <i>English</i>: And the most of them
make good Proficiency therein.</p>

<p>I have, by the good Providence of God,
been favoured with religious, faithful and
learned Masters, in general, from the first setting
up of this School, at the Expence of about
<i>£.</i>56 lawful Money per Annum, i. e.
<i>£.</i>3 per Month, with their Board, and all
Accommodations, and a Horse kept or provided
when needed; which I suppose can't
be esteemed less than the Sum which I mention:
And if this seems to any to be large, I
have only this to say, that I could not have
the Choice of Masters at less Expence. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the Expence for Tuition will likely be saved
for some Time, by the Generosity of a young
Gentleman, who proposes to keep it <i>gratis</i> a
few Months.</p>

<p>The Method of conducting this School
has been, and is designed to be after this Manner,
viz. they are obliged to be clean, and
decently dressed, and be ready to attend
Prayers, before Sun-rise in the Fall and Winter,
and at 6 o'Clock in the Summer. A Portion
of Scripture is read by several of the Seniors
of them: And those who are able answer
a Question in the <i>Assembly's Catechism</i>, and
have some Questions asked them upon it, and
an Answer expounded to them. After Prayers,
and a short Time for their Diversion, the
School begins with Prayer about 9, and ends
at 12, and again at 2, and ends at 5 o'Clock
with Prayer. Evening Prayer is attended before
the Day-light is gone. Afterwards they
apply to their Studies, &amp;c. They attend the
publick Worship, and have a Pew devoted
to their Use, in the House of God. On
Lord's-Day Morning, between and after the
Meetings, the Master, or some one whom
they will submit to, is with them, inspects
their Behaviour, hears them read, catechises
them, discourses to them, &amp;c. And once or
twice a Week they hear a Discourse calculated
to their Capacities upon the most important
and interesting Subjects. And in general
they are orderly and governable: They
appear to be as perfectly easy and contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with their Situation and Employment as any
at a Father's House, I scarcely hear a Word
of their going Home, so much as for a Visit,
for Years together, except it be when they
first come.</p>

<p>And the Success of Endeavours hitherto,
the general Approbation of great and good
Men, and the Testimonies many have given
of it, by their seasonable Liberality towards
its Support, have seemed to me such evident
Tokens of a Divine Hand in Favour of it,
and so plain Intimations of the Divine Will
concerning it, that I have, as I said before,
thought it Duty, notwithstanding all Discouragements,
to pursue the Design, and endeavour
to keep Pace with the Providences
of God in Favour of it as to their Number,
and trust in Him, "whose the Earth is, and
the Fulness thereof," for further Supplies.
And I have hoped this would be esteemed
sufficient to clear me of the Imputation of
Presumption and Rashness in risquing my
own private Interest, as I have done.</p>

<p>The Honourable <span class="smcap">London</span> Commissioners
hearing of the Design, enquired into it, and
encouraged it by an Allowance of 12l. lawful
Money, by their Vote <i>November 12. 1756</i>.
And again in the Year 1758 they allowed me
20l.&mdash;and in <i>November</i> 4th, 1760, granted
me an annual Allowance of 20l. for my Assistance&mdash;and
in <i>October</i> 8th, 1761, they granted
me 12l. towards the Support of <i>Isaiah
Uncas</i>, Son of the Sachem of <i>Mohegan</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
10l. more for his Support the following Year.
In <i>October 1756</i>, I received a Legacy of fifty-nine
Dollars of Mrs. <i>Ann Bingham</i> of <i>Windham</i>.
In <i>July 1761</i>, I received a generous Donation
of Fifty Pounds Sterling from the Right Hon.
<span class="smcap">William</span>, Marquis of <i>Lothian</i>. And in <i>Nov.
1761</i>, a Donation of 25l. Sterl. from Mr. <i>Hardy</i>
of <i>London</i>&mdash;and in <i>May 1762</i>, a second Donation
of 50l. Sterl. from that most Honorable
and noble Lord, the Marquis of <i>Lothian</i>; and
at the same Time 20l. Sterl. from Mr. <i>Samuel
Savage</i>, Merchant in <i>London</i>: And a Collection
of Ten Guineas from the Rev. Dr. <i>A. Giffords</i>
in <i>London</i>: And 10l. Sterl. more from a Lady
in <i>London</i>, unknown, which is still in the
Hands of a Friend, and to be remitted with
some additional Advantage, and to be accounted
for when received. And also for 7 Years
past I have, one Year with another, received
about 11l. lawful Money Annually, Interest
of Subscriptions. And in my Journey to
<i>Portsmouth</i> last <i>June</i>, I received in private Donations
66l. 17s. 7d. 1-4th. lawful Money.
I also received for the Use of this School, a
Bell of about 80 lb. weight, from a Gentleman
in <i>London</i>. In <i>November 1761</i>, the Great and
General Court or Assembly of the Province of
<i>Massachusetts-Bay</i>, voted, That I should be allowed
to take under my Care six Children of
the <i>Six Nations</i>, for Education, Clothing and
Boarding, and be allowed for that Purpose,
for each of said Children, 12l. per Annum for
one Year, which Boys I have obtained, and
they have been for some Time in this School.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The Honourable <span class="smcap">Scotch</span> Commissioners
in and near <i>Boston</i>, understanding and approving
of the Design of sending for <i>Indian</i> Children
of remote Tribes, to be educated here,
were the first Body, or Society, who have
led the Way in making an Attempt for that
Purpose. Which because of the Newness and
remarkable Success of it, and because it may
encourage such a Design in time to come, I
suppose it may not be disagreeable, if I am a
little particular in my Account of it: While
I was in <i>Boston</i> they passed a Vote to this purpose,
<i>May 7, 1761</i>, "That the Reverend Mr.
<i>Wheelock</i> of <i>Lebanon</i> be desired, to fit out <i>David
Fowler</i>, an <i>Indian</i> Youth, to accompany
Mr. <i>Sampson Occom</i>, going on a Mission to the
<i>Oneidas</i>, that said <i>David</i> be supported on said
Mission for a Term not exceeding 4 Months;
and that he endeavour on his Return to bring
with him a Number of <i>Indian</i> Boys, not exceeding
three, to be put under Mr. <i>Wheelock</i>'s
Care and Instruction, and that 20l. be put
into Mr. <i>Wheelock</i>'s Hands to carry this Design
into Execution; and that when said Sum
shall be expended, he advise the Treasurer of
it, and send his Accounts for Allowance."</p>

<p>Pursuant to this Vote I cloathed and furnished
said <i>David</i> with Horse and Money, for
his long Tour into the Wilderness, which he
set out on <i>June</i> 10th, in Company with Mr.
<i>Occom</i>, by the Way of <i>New-York</i>; in which
Journey he rode above a thousand Miles, and
by the Advice, Direction and Assistance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Sir <span class="smcap">William Johnson</span>, obtained three Boys
of the <i>Mohawk</i> Nation, who were willing to
leave their Friends and Country and come among
Strangers of another Language, and
quite another Manner of Living, and where,
perhaps, no one of their Nation then living
had ever been; and among a People of whom
their Nation have been of a long Time inclined
to entertain Jealousies. Their Names
were <i>Joseph</i>, <i>Negyes</i>, and <i>Center</i>. They arrived
here <i>August</i> 1st, 1761, but had so much
Caution in the extraordinary Enterprize, that
they brought each of them an Horse from
their own Country. Two of them were but
little better than naked, and could not speak
a Word of <i>English</i>. The other being of a Family
of Distinction among them, was considerably
cloathed, <i>Indian</i>-fashion, and could
speak a few Words of <i>English</i>. They let me
know, as soon as I could understand them,
that Sir <span class="smcap">Wm. Johnson</span> had told them they
should return and visit their Friends in the
Fall of the Year. I took speedy Care to
<i>cleanse</i> and cloath them. They many Ways
discovered some Jealousies respecting the Design
of their coming; but by Acquaintance
and Freedom with other <i>Indians</i> in the School,
and by constant Care for them and Kindness
to them, those Jealousies seemed in a little
Time to wear away, and they appeared to
feel and enjoy themselves as though they had
been at home in a Father's House. Daily
Care was exercised for them, and particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Caution that they might in no Instance appear
to be, thro' Disrespect, distinguished from any
in the School. Such Distinction, or any thing
which they apprehend to be so, I find will
at once occasion Jealousies and Disaffection.
And this seems to be agreeable to a settled
Principle among themselves, (according to
which they are wont to treat their Captives)
viz. that those who take the Patronage of
Children, not their own, shall treat them in
all respects as their own.</p>

<p><i>Center</i>'s Countenance, as I thought when
he came, discovered that he was not in Health.
My Suspicions increased, and the Issue proved
they were not groundless. He continued
with me till the Fall, when the Physician
I employed advised me, that his
Disorders threatned his Life, and prevailed
to such a Degree that he looked upon
him to be incurable, and that he judged
it best to send him back to his Friends, and
that soon, or it would be too late to send him
at all; and according to this Advice I sent
him away with <i>Negyes</i>, having furnished them
with Money for their Journey into the <i>Mohawk</i>
Country, on the 23d Day of <i>October</i>.
<i>Joseph</i> tarried longer to accompany young
<i>Kirtland</i>, who was learning the <i>Mohawk</i> Language
of him, and whom I sent into that
Country to obtain six Boys of those Nations,
to partake of the Benefit of Sir <span class="smcap">Peter Warren's</span>
Legacy, according to the Instructions
of the General Assembly of the Province of
<i>Massachusetts-Bay</i>, before mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Center</i> reached home, but died soon after.
<i>Negyes</i>, I hear, was captivated by a young
Female and married. Mr. <i>Kirtland</i> and <i>Joseph</i>
set out for the <i>Mohawk</i> Country <i>November</i> 4th,
and returned <i>November</i> 27th, and brought
two <i>Mohawk</i> Lads with them, viz. <i>Moses</i> and
<i>Johannes</i>, by whom Sir <span class="smcap">Wm. Johnson</span> informed
me that he expected to be able to send
the Rest when they came in from hunting.
I informed the Hon. Commissioners of the
State of the Case, and by a Letter from the
Reverend Dr. <span class="smcap">Chauncy</span>, Chairman of their
Committee, in the Name of the rest, was desired
to let them have in their Pay and under
their Direction these two who came last with
<i>Joseph</i>, which I consented to, provided they
would remit the necessary Charges which I
had been at in procuring and cloathing them,
and give me as I afterwards charged them
for their Support and Tuition, upon which
Conditions they took them. I immediately
sent to Sir <span class="smcap">Wm. Johnson</span> for other six to partake
of Sir <span class="smcap">Peter Warren's</span> Legacy. These
three, viz. <i>Joseph</i>, <i>Moses</i> and <i>Johannes</i>, continued
with me in the Pay of the Commissioners
till <i>May 27, 1762</i>, when I offered said Committee
my Accompt, the whole Amount of
which, that is, for cloathing and furnishing
<i>David</i> with Horse and Money for his Support
in his long Journey of several Months, the
Expence of the Boy's Journey home above
200 Miles. The Expence of <i>Kirtland</i>'s Journey
(excepting his Horse) into that Country
to bring down <i>Moses</i> and <i>Johannes</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
pasturing the Horses of the first three the time
they continued here, in a dry and difficult Season;
the cloathing all five, and repairing their
Cloathing the whole Time they tarried; the
Boarding and Schooling them, finding Washing,
Lodging, Firewood, Candles, Books, Paper,
&amp;c. I say, the Amount of the Expence
for the Five and in the whole Affair for near
twelve Months, Errors excepted, was but just
58l. 17s. 7d. 1-4th. Sterling. But in this Accompt
I charged nothing for several expensive
Journeys in this Government, taken by myself,
and another preparatory and necessary to
the Design of <i>David</i>'s Mission, nor for any
Labour, Care or Pains of my own therein
from first to last&mdash;For their Board, Washing
and Lodging but 5s. per Week; the lowest
common Price in these Parts was 6s. L. M.
What Cloathing, &amp;c. they had of me, I charged
at the lowest Cash-price, and what I got
for them of our Traders, Shoemakers, Taylors,
&amp;c. I charged just as they charged me, without
any Advance in one Instance. I charged nothing
for extraordinary Trouble and Care for
<i>Center</i>, in his declining State; nor did the
Physician charge for what he did for him.
And there were other Provisions made to prevent
Expence of Money in their Journeyings
more than is common, for which there was
nothing charged, by all which the Accompt
was somewhat less than it would otherwise
have been&mdash;&mdash;But then on the other Hand it
may be considered,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That Provisions of all Sorts were then,
and still are, at an higher Price than ever before
in these Parts, occasioned by the preceeding
Wars and extreme Drought. When they
are reduced to their usual Price, the Expence
of educating <i>Indian</i> Youth will be much less.</p>

<p>2. The Circumstances of this Undertaking
were extraordinary, and the necessary Expences
of it were consequently so, and such
as there may never be such Occasion for again.
This was the opening a Door which never
had been opened for such a Purpose to these
Nations; and it was thought by many who
knew their great Fondness for their Children,
that it could not be soon accomplished, i. e.
to make either Parents or Children willing to
comply with an Invitation to come such a vast
Length, and under such Circumstances as have
been mentioned. But the Report of <i>David</i>
confirmed by the Boys on their Return, has
given such Conviction of the Sincerity and
Kindness of our Intentions towards them, as
has removed all Objections. And nothing
more is now necessary to our obtaining as
many well-chosen Boys and Girls as we please,
but to employ some faithful Missionary among
them for that Purpose.</p>

<p>I have been the more particular in this
Account, because I would remove the unreasonable
Prejudices raised against this Method,
by partial and unfair Accounts, and
a Cry of enormous Expences, &amp;c. And to let
the World know there is nothing in it worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
to be objected by one who is in earnest to
accomplish this great and important Design.</p>

<p>What I have done for this School since
its Beginning, in many expensive Journies;
(for none of which have I ever charged any
Thing at all); in constant Care for their
Health, in Endeavours to cure their savage
Disposition, and form their Minds and Manners
to right Rules of Virtue and Religion, in
extraordinary Care and Trouble for several of
them in Sickness, in Expences by Company,
not only of <i>English</i> but <i>Indians</i> at my House,
occasioned thereby; and incidental Charges
in many Instances, none are able justly to estimate,
or likely so much as to think of many
of them, but one who is intimately acquainted
with the Business: In Consideration for
which I have had the Assistance of several of
them a few Times in an extraordinary Croud
of Business; and of late some Advantage by
the School to two of my own Children.
Which Reward I suppose impartial Judges
will not think to bear a very considerable Proportion
to these Expences which are not
charged, and which in my Judgment is not
the one Tenth Part of them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Moor's</span> Grant contains about two
Acres of Pasturing, a small House and Shop;
for the Use of which from the first I have
received about <i>£</i>. 4 lawful Money, clear of
the Charge of Repairing, which is not equal
to the Money I have paid to Physicians which
is not charged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>I have professed to have no View to
making an Estate by this Affair: What the
Singleness and Uprightness of my Heart has
been before GOD, he knows; and also how
greatly I stand in need of his Pardon.</p>

<p>My Accompt with the School has been
charged after the following Manner, viz.
For the whole Expence of Cloathing, Boarding
and Tutoring the Boys from <i>December</i>
18th. 1754, to <i>November</i> 26th. 1760. at the
Rate of <i>£</i>. 16 lawful Money per Annum, for
each; but when their Number was so increased
I found it necessary to come nearer to
the true Value of it, and have since used
greater Exactness; but have never charged
higher than at the lowest Money Price for
what they have had of me, and for what I
have bought for them of our Traders, Shoemakers,
Taylors, &amp;c. I have charged just
what I have given, and no more. I have
charged for their Tuition, as for <i>English</i> Scholars,
i. e. for Latin Scholars, and such as
were savage and needed much Care and Instruction,
at 2<i>s.</i> L.M. per Week, or <i>£</i>. 4 10<i>s.</i>
per Annum; and for others proportionally.
The whole School, one Year with another,
has not quite cleared my Expence for the
Master. Last Year it did a little more; and
since the 27th of <i>May</i> last, it has over-done
my Expence for the Master 15<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> besides
the Tuition of the Girls. I have charged for
the Girls but 4<i>d.</i> per Week, i. e. for one
Day's Schooling and Dinner; and the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Expence for their Education will be but little
more than their Cloathing.</p>

<p>The total Amount of all my Disbursements
in this whole Affair, for near Eight Years,
that is, since <i>December</i> 18. 1754, to <i>November</i>
27. 1762, charged in the Manner, and after
the Rate before-mentioned, is, (Errors excepted)
<i>£</i>. 566 2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> Sterling.&mdash;And the total
Amount of all the Donations before-mentioned,
together with smaller ones, which I suppose
needless to mention particularly, received
within the said Term, is, (Errors excepted)
<i>£</i>. 509 2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> Sterling.</p>

<p>And as this School was set up when there
was no Scheme devised, or Plan laid, which
this could be in Opposition to; so it is not
continued in Opposition to any other Measures
which are proposed or pursued by others.</p>

<p>And, blessed be GOD that he has put it
into the Hearts of a Number of Gentlemen
of Ability in and near <span class="smcap">Boston</span>, to contribute
so liberally towards the Furtherance of the
general Design. And is it not a Pity that
Christians of all Denominations should not
unite their utmost Endeavours for the Accomplishment
of it; and especially now while
the Door is so widely opened for it? And
what a Pity is it that any Time should be lost?
And how exceeding mean, and infinitely beneath
those noble Sentiments, and that generous
Love to the Souls of Men, and to our
<span class="smcap">King</span> and Country, which true Religion inspires,
will it be to fall into Parties; and on
Account of differing Opinions reflecting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
most probable Methods for accomplishing the
End, to obstruct and hinder one another
therein? There is enough for all to do; and
the Affair is of so great Importance, that it
calls for the Trial of every Method that has
the least Probability of Success; and different
Methods may greatly subserve and assist one
another.</p>

<p>We can none of us boast such Perfection
of Understanding and Skill in the Affair as to
set up safely for Infallibility. Many Attempts
have been made by wise and good Men; and
the Issue has taught them their Want of that
Knowledge which is got by Experience; and
that their pious Labour and Expence had been
in a great Measure lost for want of it.</p>

<p class="b2">And I would take this Opportunity to express
my Gratitude for those generous Benefactions
whereby this Infant Institution has
been hitherto supported; and I hope through
the Blessing of GOD upon our our Endeavours,
those pious Benefactors will have Occasion
for the most easy and comfortable Reflections,
as having made an Offering acceptable to
GOD, and bestowed it well for the Advancement
of the Kingdom, and Glory of the great
<span class="smcap">Redeemer</span>: And that the Blessing of many
of our <i>American</i> Heathens, who shall in the
present and succeeding Generations, reap the
Benefit thereof, may come upon them: And
that others understanding that this School
stills lives, under GOD, upon the Charity of
good Men, will be moved to open their Hands
to minister further, and necessary Supplies
for it.</p>

<p class="pn15 eg p1">SIR,</p>

<p class="pn p1">We Ministers of the Gospel, and Pastors
of Churches hereafter mentioned with
our Names, having for a Number of Years
past heard of, or seen with Pleasure, the Zeal,
Courage and firm Resolution of the Reverend
<span class="smcap">Eleazar Wheelock</span> of <i>Lebanon</i>, to prosecute
to Effect a Design of spreading the Gospel
among the Natives in the Wilds of our <i>America</i>,
and especially his Perseverance in it,
amidst the many peculiar Discouragements he
had to encounter during the late Years of the
War here, and upon a Plan which appears to
us to have the greatest Probability of Success,

as we are verily perswaded, that the Smiles
of divine Providence upon his School, and the
Success of his Endeavours hitherto, justly may

it to be of GOD, and that which he
will own and succeed for the Glory of his

Kingdom of our divine Redeemer, as well as
for the great Benefit of the Crown of <i>Great-Britain</i>,
and especially of his Majesty's Dominions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in <i>America</i>; so we apprehend, that
the present Openings in Providence ought to
invite Christians of every Denomination to unite
their Endeavours, and lend a helping
Hand in carrying on the charitable Design;
and we are heartily sorry if Party Spirit and
Party Differences shall at all obstruct the Progress
of it, or the old Leaven in this Land ferment
upon this Occasion, and give a watchful
Adversary Opportunity so to turn the Course
of Endeavours into another Channel, as to defeat
the Design of spreading the Gospel among
the Heathen.</p>

<p>To prevent which, and encourage Unanimity
and Zeal in prosecuting the Design, we
look upon it our Duty as Christians, and especially
as Ministers of the Gospel, to give our
Testimony, That, as we verily believe, a disinterested
Regard to the Advancement of the
Redeemer's Kingdom, and the Good of his
Majesty's Dominions in <i>America</i> were the governing
Motives which at first induced the
Reverend Mr. <span class="smcap">Wheelock</span> to enter upon the
great Affair, and to risque his own private Interest
as he has done since in carrying it on;
so we esteem his Plan to be good, his Measures
prudently and well-concerted, his Endowments
peculiar, his Zeal fervent, his Endeavours
indefatigable for the accomplishing
this Design; and we know no Man like-minded
who will naturally care for their State.
May God prolong his Life, and make him
extensively useful in the Kingdom of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>We have also some of us at his Desire examined
his Accounts, and find that besides
giving in all his own Labour and Trouble in
the Affair, he has charged for the Support,
Schooling, &amp;c. of the Youth, at the lowest
Rate it could be done for, as the Price has
been and still is among us; and we apprehend
the generous Donations already made, has
been, and we are confident will be laid out
in the most prudent Manner, and with the best
Advice for the Furtherance of the important
Design. And we pray God abundantly to
reward the Liberality of any upon this Occasion;
and we hope the Generosity, especially
of Persons of Distinction and Note, will be a
happy Lead and Inducement to still greater
Liberalities, and that in Consequence thereof
the wide extended Wilderness of <i>America,
will blossom as the Rose, Habitations of Cruelty
become Dwelling-Places of Righteousness, and
the Blessing of Thousands ready to perish come upon
all those</i> whose Love to Christ, and Charity
to them, has been shown upon this Occasion,
which is the hearty Prayer of,</p>

alike precious Souls, form'd for God and Religion as much as
the Males; but also because the Care for the Souls of Children
in Families, and more especially in those of low Degree,
lies chiefly upon the Mothers for the first 7 or 8 Years:

promoting Christian Knowledge; which when he had communicated
to them they put into Print, and sent it to the
Directors of the 1764 Schools; (if I have not miscounted)
that so a greater Proportion of Girls might be taken into them
to receive a religious Education for the sake of their Posterity,
and therein for the more effectual answering the very End of
their Charity Schools."&mdash;&mdash;</p></div></div>

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
