Journal of Entomology and Zoology

EDITED BY POMONA COLLEGE, DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY


Subscription $1.00 to domestic, $1.25 to foreign countries.

This journal is especially offered in exchange for zoological
and entomological journals, proceedings, transactions, reports
of societies, museums, laboratories and expeditions.

The pages of the journal are especially open to western entomologists
and zoologists. Notes and papers relating to western
and Californian forms and conditions are particularly desired,
but short morphological, systematic or economic studies from
any locality will be considered for publication.

Manuscripts submitted should be typewritten on one side of
paper about 8 by 11 inches. Foot notes, tables, explanations of
figures, etc., should be written on separate sheets. Foot notes
and figures should be numbered consecutively throughout. The
desired position of foot notes and figures should be clearly
indicated in the manuscript.

Figures should be drawn so that they may be reproduced as
line cuts so far as possible. An unusually large number of half
tones must be paid for in part by the author. Other more
expensive illustrations will be furnished at cost. Figures for
cuts should be made to conform to the size of the page when
reduced, that is, 5 by 7&frac12; inches or less. The lettering should
be by means of printed numbers and letters pasted on the
drawings, in most cases.

Authors of articles longer than a thousand words will receive
fifty reprints of their publications free of cost. If more than
this are desired, the order should be given with the return of
the proof sheets. Extra copies and special covers or special
paper will be furnished at cost. Authors of short contributions

List of Bees from Claremont-Laguna Region

HENRY BRAY


Through the kindness of Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell and several
others I have been able to get large numbers of our local bees
determined. The basis of the work was the extensive Cook-Baker
collection of the college with additional material of my own and
others. Many of the species here listed have been collected by
me and others, but unless not represented in the original college
collection it is not noted in the list. So far as the relations of bees
to plants has been noted by me it is given in the list. Many other
species remain to be determined and only a beginning has been
made in respect to the relation of the bees to plants.

A Partial List of the Mammals of the Claremont Region

LEON L. GARDNER


Since little or nothing has been published on mammals of this
region it was deemed advisable to print a list even though very incomplete
and based on preliminary and limited collecting in order
to have some definite forward step in this much neglected line.
Some of the mammals listed below have not been collected by us
but are known to occur. Thanks are due Mr. H. S. Swaith for his
kind aid in identification of some of the skins collected.

Bears of course have long since disappeared but still have left
their reputation among old mountaineers. The story goes that a
bear, perhaps the last one, was killed at Bear Flats on the trail to
&ldquo;Old Baldy,&rdquo; hence the name.

Odocoileus hemionus californicus. (Caton.) California Mule
Deer. Fairly common through Upper Sonoran and Transition
zones. They have been taken as low as the mouth of San Dimas
canyon. The recently established game preserve assures an increase
in the future. Already they seem to have sensed the protection
for on May 19, 1916, we were surprised to find just 75 feet
before us a large doe on the auto road not far above the first power
house.

Ovis canadensis nelsoni? C. M. Merriam. Merriam Desert
Bighorn. Mountain sheep have lived for years in the higher peaks
above Claremont but being very shy and in inaccessible and little
frequented parts have escaped attention very successfully. Rumor
has it that Mountain Goats are found with the sheep but I believe
this to be unfounded, having been originated probably by the sight
of the smaller horned females and young. The area occupied by
the sheep is a very definite one and comprises the peaks Ontario,
Cucamonga, Telegraph, St. Antonio (&ldquo;Old Baldy&rdquo;), and Iron
Mountain with their high rocky intervening ridges. Of the points
mentioned the first three peaks are the favored ones. I found only
a few tracks on Iron Mountain and a rumor of a pair of horns
found there some five or eight years ago. &ldquo;Old Baldy&rdquo; being too
« 102 »
often visited is not a frequented spot for the sheep, serving only
as a connecting link to Iron Mountain. However signs around
Ontario, Cucamonga and Telegraph peaks are abundant and anyone
with a little patience and diligent endeavor can readily see the
sheep themselves. They travel often in bands, as many as fifty
and in summer keep to the highest places. Where they go in winter
is as yet a mystery to me, probably lower into canyon heads for I
have never found them on the top during this season. This of
course is natural for these peaks practically become great ice mountains
dangerous for anything to travel over. Besides grass the
food consists of twigs and leaves of Castonapsis sempewirens,
several species of Ceanothus, Rhammus croceus californicus, Rhus
trilobata and a parsnip Pastinaca sativa.

Citellus beecheyi. Richardson. California Ground Squirrel.
Abundant in all parts from brush land to 8,000 feet altitude in
suitable localities.

Sciurus griseus anthonyi. Mearns. Anthony Gray Squirrel.
Very common in the transition zone. In early spring they start
working on pine cones on the mountain tops, gradually coming
down to more abundant supplies of food until fall finds them down
in the oak belt feeding on acorns. They winter as low as Palmers
canyon in some cases.

Entamias Sp. Abundant in the pine belt and as high as the top
of &ldquo;Baldy.&rdquo; They are good climbers, exceedingly active and bursting
with curiosity.

Onychomys torridus ramona. Rhoads. San Bernardino Grasshopper
Mouse. But two specimens of this carnivorous mouse were
taken in a period of trapping extending over three months. Both
specimens were taken on bait consisting of rolled oats and in the
same place, east of Indian Hill in the brush. A good many of my
specimens were more or less devoured in the traps in this locality,
and I strongly suspect this mouse of the crime. Nowhere else were
my mice eaten or were any grasshopper mice taken.

Peromyscus maniculatus gambeli. Baird. Gambel White-footed
Mouse. This species was one of the most common forms taken,
being abundant in the brushy valley and foothills. There is a great
deal of color variation in the specimens taken.

« 103 »

Peromyscus boylei rowleyi. (Allen.) Rowley White-footed
Mouse. No specimens were trapped in the valley. However these
mice were found not uncommon at the mouth of Palmers canyon,
just four miles north of Claremont, in the dry brush land. Within
the canyon they were common and were taken as high as the top
of Ontario peak along fallen logs. At Camp Baldy they are very
common especially along watercourses and fallen logs. Indications
are that they ignore zonal limits being taken well down in
Lower Sonoran zone and in high transition and not necessarily
near water.

Peromyscus californicus insignis. Rhoads. Chemisal Mouse.
Not common. None were taken in the valley and few in the canyons.
They were not found along waterways but frequently brushy
hillsides. This is a large species of mouse and was almost too much
for the little &ldquo;gee whiz&rdquo; traps to hold.

Peromyscus eremicus fraterculus. Miller. Dulzura Mouse.
Common in the brush land of both valley and foothill, being found
in the canyons also.

Reithrodontomys megalotis longicauda. Baird. Long-tailed
Harvest Mouse. Common in valley and foothill. Although partial
to grassy areas (I took many in the grassy runways made by
meadow mice&mdash;Microtus californicus). I found them not uncommon
in the dry brush land east of Indian Hill.

Neotoma fuscipes macrotis. Thomas. Southern Brush Rat.
Common from valley to 5,000 feet in the mountains in suitable
localities. I took one in the property house at the Greek theatre
this June. The large nests are seen very commonly in the canyons
and hillsides.

Neotoma intermedia intermedia. Rhoads. Intermediate Brush
Rat. There seems to be a curious reversal of conditions between
this and the former species. Whereas this species is supposed to
be taken only up to 3,000 feet, I took none below 3,000, all being
taken at 5,000 feet or more along fallen logs near watercourses,
and the former species was limited more distinctly to the foothills
which is not a typical condition.

Microtus californicus californicus. (Peale.) California
Meadow Mouse. Common in runways through the grass in damp
« 104 »
canyons, at Palmers canyon and in other suitable localities. One
was taken as high as Kelly&rsquo;s cabin&mdash;on Ontario peak, among fallen
logs by a cold mountain stream. While setting trap in the runways
I more than once caught glimpses of them darting along the
aisles in the grass.

Thomomys bottæ pallescens. Rhoads. Southern Pocket Gopher.
Abundant in the valley, often doing much damage in lawns
and orchards.

Perodipus agilis agilis. (Gambel.) Gambel Kangaroo Rats.
Abundant from valley to Transition zone. I found them abundant
at Brown&rsquo;s Flats where the evidences of their digging and their
holes are on every side. I have trapped them in brush country,
rocky areas, open brushless places, and at the mouth of ground
squirrel holes.

Lepus californicus. (Gray.) Jack-Rabbit. Common in the
valley and to a certain extent in the foothills and higher.

Sylvilagus auduboni sanctidiegi. (Miller.) San Diego Cottontail.
Abundant in the Lower Sonoran zone. Increasing each year
due to the protection afforded by game laws. Considerable damage
to young trees is done by cottontails and they are a great pest to
the farmer.

Sylvilagus bachmani cinerascens. (Allen.) Ashy Brush Rabbit.
Fairly common in the brush. They are not swift runners and rely
on escaping by hiding behind clumps of brush. This is more typically
an Upper Sonoran form.

Felis oregonensis oregonensis. (Rafinesque.) Pacific Cougar.
Numberless reports are always coming in of Mountain Lions and
as usual most of them prove to be unfounded. However authentic
records of these beasts are not lacking. I have personally inspected
a specimen shot in Cold Water Canyon not more than five years
ago. Tradition has it that at one time a mountaineer was actually
besieged for two days in the little cabin at Browns Flats. Lions
have been seen at Browns Flats, Cattle Canyon and the north of
Telegraph peak. Mountaineers tell me that they are a great deal
more common in the San Gabriel drainage. The specimen which
I saw was from one of the tributary canyons to the San Gabriel
river.

« 105 »

Lynx eremicus californicus. (Mearns.) California Wild Cat.
Common in the mountains and ranging over the valley. About
once a year a specimen is brought in to be skinned or identified and
great stories are told about them. One of the commonest fallacies
is that there are two forms in the mountains, one a &ldquo;Bob cat&rdquo; with
short tail and ear tufts, and the other a true &ldquo;Link&rdquo; or Lynx with
longer tail and more prominent ear tufts. It is little wonder, however,
that such a notion exists in view of the fact of the great range
or variations found in these animals. As for actual records of
captures. In the summer of 1911 one was shot in the brushy hillsides
of Laguna Canyon (Orange Co.) and brought in to the Marine
Laboratory. In the spring of 1912 a &#9792; was shot at the mouth
of San Dimas canyon and brought to the college. In December
1914 a &#9792; in very worn pelage was shot while crossing the Santa
Ana river near Prado Beach and brought to me to be skinned. Finally
while trapping for foxes in Palmers canyon in March of 1916
I took a male.

Canis ochropus ochropus. (Eschscholtz.) California Coyote.
Common in the brush land above Claremont and in the foothills.
The yapping bark is a very familiar cry to any who live near the
outskirts of the town and may be heard nearly any evening. Although
having camped numerous times in the mountains I have
never heard Coyotes above the foothill region.

Urocyon cinereoargenteus californicus. (Mearns.) California
Gray Fox. Signs of foxes in the canyons and along mountain trails
are always quite common. F&oelig;ces containing seeds of manzanita
berries are familiar occurrences. They are fond of fruit and are
readily trapped with such bait. In March 1916 three were caught
one night at the same place in Live Oak canyon.

Procyon psora psora. (Gray.) California Coon. Coons are
fairly common in the larger canyons where there is an abundance
of water. I have seen their tracks in Palmers, Cucamonga and San
Antonio canyons. Three were trapped this winter (1916) just
above Camp Baldy at an altitude of about 5400 feet.

Mephitis occidentalis holzneri. (Mearns.) Southern California
Striped Skunk. Not very common in this region, found mostly in
the Upper Sonoran zone in wooded districts.

« 106 »

Spilogale phenax phenax. (C. H. Merriam.) California Spotted
Skunk. Very common in valley, foothills and up to 6,000 feet
in the mountains. They are fearless little creatures and will readily
enter cabins in the mountains and keep the occupant awake by rattling
pots and pans while scrambling around in search of food,
needless to say creating an awkward situation for the host. They
have been known to take up their abode underneath houses in
Claremont and take the liberty of scampering around the parlor
floor without regard to the presence of human beings. This was a
common occurrence in a certain family I have in mind and on such
occasions the unwelcome guest was gently ushered to the door
without hurting its feelings and peace of mind restored to the
household. They are the easiest of all animals to trap and made
considerable trouble and embarrassment for me by continually blundering
into traps of mine set for other game. I have found these
little creatures as high as 6,000 feet in the canyons.

Mustela xanthogenys xanthogenys. (Gray.) California Weasel.
I had always been interested in weasels as to their occurrence and
until this year had taken only one in town with a record of only two
or three seen along the railroad track. Then in one week four
weasels were given me and a record of seven others obtained, all
these are from nearby orange groves and from below town along
the railroad track where for a long time I have known they occurred.

Scapanus latimanus occultus. (Grinnell and Swartz.) Southern
California Mole. Moles are occasionally caught in orchards
and lawns and the characteristic workings are familiar sights in
the mountains up to 8,000 feet. Our specimens were all from the
valley.

Antrozous pallidus pacificus. (Merriam.) Pacific Pale Bat.
I have taken several of these bats from behind pictures and in the
attics of some of the college buildings. I do not know their relative
abundance or distribution but they are certainly common on the
campus in spring and summer.

Myotis evotis. (Allen.) Long-eared Bat. This form also
occurs in the college buildings and I believe to a certain extent in
the mountains.

A Preliminary List of Shells from Laguna Beach and Nearby


For a number of years past students have collected shells from
Laguna Beach, these and the Bradshaw collection form the basis
for this list, which includes shells not farther than ten or twelve
miles up and down the coast. The earlier collections were by
Mabel Guernsey and P. R. Daggs. Practically all the shells drawn
and photographed are from the Bradshaw collection because the
shells were in better condition. Some of the earlier specimens were
determined by the United States National Museum. Suggestions and
corrections were kindly made by Mrs. T. S. Oldroyd. The photographs
are by Robins and Cooper. Many of the drawings are by
Miss Margaret Cate. Doubtful specimens are largely omitted in this
list, but a few are included and marked by a question.

A Reconstruction of the Nervous System of a Nemertian Worm

WILLIAM A. HILTON


Small specimens of Carinella cingulata Cole were fixed in Mercuric
chloride and cut in series. A general hematoxylin stain was
very satisfactory for general anatomy. For a study of the finer
structure other preparations will be necessary.

No attempt will be made to give a complete review of the literature
relating to this group. Almost every systematic paper has
something, because of the importance of the nervous system in classification
and because in many cases the nervous system may be seen
through the body-wall without dissection.

One of the first extensive accounts of these animals which also
included quite a consideration of the nervous system was McIntosh
in 1874. Several of the genus Nemestes were studied and the general
form of the nervous system shown. Amphipheris is shown in a
similar manner with a single lobe of the brain and with the two
brain commissures. Tetrastemma is shown in a similar manner.
Hubrecht in 1887 has an extensive paper in which the details of
several nervous systems are shown as they show in reconstructions
from sections. Eupolia girardi is especially well shown with its
small dorsal and large ventral commissure and with three brain
lobes. It is in this paper that Hubrecht makes his interesting comparison
between the nemertians and cordates. In his paper of 1880
he has shown the structure and position of different parts of the
nervous system of nemertians, especially of Cerebratulus of which
he gives a very good figure. In this he shows a reconstruction of
the brain with its chief nerves, ventral and dorsal commissures,
general position of the cells, the two lobes of the brain on each
side and the chief nerves. He also treats of nemertian nervous
systems of many other forms, but not in so much detail.

Burger in 1890, '91, has extensive papers on the nervous
system of the group. He discusses not only the general form, but
also the minute structure of the nervous system of a number of different
types. In 1895 Burger has another important paper on this
« 120 »
group of animals. In it he shows in some forms a marked dorsal
ganglion and a ventral ganglion with the typical nerves. Burger
showed that all ganglion cells are unipolar, without membranes.
Montgomery, 1897, discusses the minute anatomy of the nerve
cells. Coe, 1895 and 1910, considers the general anatomy of the
nervous system, but nerve details are for the most part not shown.

In a young Carinella cingulata Cole which I have studied by
means of reconstructions, I find no unusual features. The nervous
system is typical of the group. The brain, however, is not very
clearly made up of two lobes on each side. This may be because
the specimen used was a young one. This may also be the reason
why the brain is not sharply marked off from the lateral nerve cords.

Figure 1 shows the brain and part of the lateral cords from the
ventral side. From the two halves of the brain come the nerves to
forward parts. The small dorsal commissure is shown with its
usual median extension. From the larger ventral commissure come
the two nerves to the proboscis, lateral to these are the nerves to
the intestine, while from the ridge of the lateral cords the lateral
nerves are shown.

Figure 2 in the larger drawing at the right shows the nervous
system as viewed from the side with the dorsal side to the left.
The central core of the ganglion and cord is to indicate the position
of the fiber area. The small drawings at the left show various
levels of the nervous system as seen in cross section. The ventral
side is up. The drawing at the top is through the brain before the
commissures are reached, the next lower is through the thickest
part of the brain and the lower two drawings are through one of
the lateral cords.

Pomona College


Located in one of the most healthful and beautiful parts of the
west coast. The mountains reach an elevation of ten thousand feet
within a few miles of the college and these with the nearby ocean
afford many special advantages for the study of things not in books.
Special advantages are afforded by the fact that the college limits
its attendance, the freshman class being restricted to two hundred
applicants. The success of the college is particularly indicated by
the large proportion of the graduates who proceed to advanced
work in the large universities. In addition, well-manned departments
of music and art afford exceptional advantages.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
