Feb. 10th, 1833.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have just 
received your communication, and notwithstanding it is Sunday morning, and 
the bells with their loud and clear voices are calling me to church, I have
sat down to answer it by return of post.       It is scarcely necessary for
me to say that I was rejoiced to see the Chrestomathie Mandchou, which will
be of no slight assistance in learning the Tartar dialect, on which ever 
since I left London I have been almost incessantly occupied.       It is, 
then, your opinion, that from the lack of anything in the form of Grammar I
have scarcely made any progress towards the attainment of Mandchou; perhaps
you will not be perfectly miserable at being informed that you were never 
more mistaken in your life.       I can already, with the assistance of 
Amyot, translate Mandchou with no great difficulty, and am perfectly
qualified to write a critique on the version of St. Matthew       s Gospel,
which I brought with me into the country.       Upon the whole, I consider 
the translation a good one, but I cannot help thinking that the author has 
been frequently too paraphrastical, and that in various places he must be 
utterly unintelligible to the Mandchous from having unnecessarily made use 
of words which are not Mandchou, and with which the Tartars cannot be 
acquainted.
What must they think, for example, on coming to the sentence . . . 
apkai etchin ni porofiyat, i.e. the prophet of the Lord of 
heaven?       For the last word in the Mandchou quotation being a 
modification of a Greek word, with no marginal explanation, renders the 
whole dark to a Tartar.                          
                                                
                                                                   
                                                             
                                                                         
                                                    ; apkai I know, 
and etchin I know, but what is porofiyat, he will say.       
Now in Tartar, there are words synonymous with our seer, diviner, or 
foreteller, and I feel disposed to be angry with the translator for not 
having used one of these words in preference to modifying 
                                              ; and it is certainly 
unpardonable of him to have Tartarized 
       yy                                   into . . . anguel, when 
in Tartar there is a word equal to our messenger, which is the literal 
translation of        yy                                  .       But I 
will have done with finding fault, and proceed to the more agreeable task 
of answering your letter.
My brother       s address is as follows:
Don Juan Borrow,
Compagnia Anglo Mexicana,
Guanajuato, Mexico.
When you write to him, the letter must be put in post before the third 
Wednesday of the month, on which day the Mexican letter-packet is made 
up.       I suppose it is unnecessary to inform you that the outward 
postage of all foreign letters must be paid at the office, but I wish you 
particularly to be aware that it will be absolutely necessary to let my 
brother know in what dialect of the Mexican this translation is made, in 
order that he may transmit it to the proper quarter, for within the short 
distance of twenty miles of the place where he resides there are no less 
than six dialects spoken, which differ more from each other than the German
does from the English.       I intend to write to him next Thursday, and if
you will favour me with an answer on this very important point, by return 
of post, I shall feel obliged.
Return my kind and respected friend Mr. Brandram my best thanks for his 
present of The Gypsies        Advocate, and assure him that, next to
the acquirement of Mandchou, the conversion and enlightening of those 
interesting people occupy the principal place in my mind.       Will he be 
willing to write to the Gypsy Committee concerning me?       I wish to 
translate the Gospel of St. John into their language, which I could easily 
do with the assistance of one or two of the old people, but then they must 
be paid, for the Gypsies are more mercenary than Jews.       I have already
written to my dear friend Mr. Cunningham on this subject, and have no doubt
that he will promote the plan to the utmost of his ability.       I must 
procure a letter of introduction from him to Joseph Gurney, and should be 
very happy to obtain one also from Mr. Brandram, for in all which regards 
the Gospel and the glory of Christ, Joseph Gurney is the principal person 
to look to in these parts.       I will now conclude by beseeching you to 
send me as soon as possible whatever can serve to enlighten me in 
respect to Mandchou Grammar, for had I a Grammar, I should in a 
month       s time be able to send a Mandchou translation of Jonah.       
In the meanwhile I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, your most humble and 
obedient servant,
G. Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
18th March, 1833,
Willow Lane, St. 
Giles, Norwich.
Dear Sir,       As yourself and Mr. Brandram 
expressed a desire to hear from me occasionally concerning my progress in 
Mandchou, I now write to inform you that I am advancing at full gallop, and
am able to translate with pleasure and facility the specimens of the best 
authors who have written in the language contained in the compilation of 
Klaproth.       But I must confess that the want of a Grammar has been, 
particularly in the beginning of my course, a great clog to my speed, and I
have little doubt that had I been furnished with one I should have attained
my present knowledge of Mandchou in half the time.       I was determined 
however not to be discouraged, and, not having a hatchet at hand to cut 
down the tree with, to attack it with my knife; and I would advise every 
one to make the most of the tools which happen to be in his possession, 
until he can procure better ones, and it is not improbable that by the time
the good tools arrive he will find he has not much need of them, having 
almost accomplished his work.       This is not exactly my case, for I 
shall be very glad to receive this same tripartite Grammar which Mr. 
Brandram is hunting for, my ideas respecting Mandchou construction being 
still very vague and wandering, and I should also be happy if you could and
would procure for me the original grammatical work of Amyot, printed in the
Memoires, etc.       Present my kind regards to Mr. Hattersley, and 
thank him in my name for his kind letter, but at the same time tell him 
that I was sorry to learn that he was putting himself to the trouble of 
transferring into Mandchou characters the specimens which Amyot has given 
in Roman, as there was no necessity for it in respect to myself, a mere 
transcript being quite sufficient to convey the information I was in need 
of.       Assure him likewise that I am much disposed to agree with him in 
his opinion of Amyot       s Dictionary, which he terms in his letter 
       something not very first-rate,        for the Frenchman       s 
translations of the Mandchou words are anything but clear and satisfactory,
and being far from literal, frequently leave the student in great doubt and
perplexity.
I have sent to my brother one copy of St. Luke       s Gospel with a 
letter; the postage was 15s. 5d.       My reason for sending only one was, 
that the rate of postage increases with the weight, and that the two 
Gospels can go out much cheaper singly than together.       The other I 
shall dispatch next month.
I subjoin a translation from the Mandchou, as I am one of those who do 
not wish people to believe words but works; and as I have had no Grammar, 
and been only seven weeks at a language which Amyot says one may acquire
in five or six years, I thought you might believe my account of my 
progress to be a piece of exaggeration and vain boasting.       The 
translation is from the Mongol History, which, not being translated by 
Klaproth, I have selected as most adapted to the present occasion; I must 
premise that I translate as I write, and if there be any inaccuracies, as I
daresay there will, some allowance must be made for haste, which prevents 
my devoting the attention necessary to a perfectly correct rendering of the
text.
I will conclude by observing that I believe myself at present competent 
to edit any book in Mandchou, if that be what is wanted, and beg 
leave to remain, dear Sir, your obedient humble servant,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
June 9th, 1833
Willow Lane, St. 
Giles, Norwich.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have mastered 
Mandchou, and I should feel obliged by your informing the Committee of the 
fact, and also my excellent friend Mr. Brandram.
I assure you that I have had no easy and pleasant task in acquiring this
language.       In the first place, it is in every respect different from 
all others which I have studied, with perhaps the exception of the Turkish,
to which it seems to bear some remote resemblance in syntax, though none in
words.       In the second place, it abounds with idiomatic phrases, which 
can only be learnt by habit, and to the understanding of which a Dictionary
is of little or no use, the words separately having either no meaning or a 
meaning quite distinct from that which they possess when thus 
conjoined.       And thirdly the helps afforded me in this undertaking have
been sadly inadequate.       However, with the assistance of God, I have 
performed my engagement.
I have translated several pieces from the Mandchou, amongst which is the
. . . or Spirit of the Hearth (          
                                                       
                                          ), which is a peculiarly 
difficult composition, and which had never previously been translated into 
a European language.       Should you desire a copy, I shall have great 
pleasure in sending one.
I shall now be happy to be regularly employed, for though I am not in 
want, my affairs are not in a very flourishing condition.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
Willow Lane,  span 
class="smcap">St. Giles, Norwich,
July 3rd, 1833.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Owing to the 
culpable tardiness of the post-office people, I have received your letter 
so late that I have little more than a quarter of an hour to answer it in, 
and be in time to despatch it by this day       s mail.       What you have
written has given me great pleasure, as it holds out hope that I may be 
employed usefully to the Deity, to man, and myself.       I shall be very 
happy to visit St. Petersburg and to become the coadjutor of Mr. 
Lipoftsoff, and to avail myself of his acquirements in what you very 
happily designate a most singular language, towards obtaining a still 
greater proficiency in it.       I flatter myself that I am for one or two 
reasons tolerably well adapted for the contemplated expedition, for besides
a competent knowledge of French and German, I possess some acquaintance 
with Russian, being able to read without much difficulty any printed 
Russian book, and I have little doubt that after a few months        
intercourse with the natives I should be able to speak it fluently.       
It would ill become me to bargain like a Jew or a Gypsy as to terms; all I 
wish to say on that point is, that I have nothing of my own, having been 
too long dependent on an excellent mother, who is not herself in very easy 
circumstances.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, truly yours,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett

Hamburg, August 4th, 1833.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I arrived at 
Hamburg yesterday after a disagreeable passage of three days, in which I 
suffered much from sea-sickness, as did all the other passengers, who were 
a medley of Germans, Swedes, and Danes, I being the only Englishman on 
board, with the exception of the captain and crew.       I landed about 
seven o       clock in the morning, and the sun, notwithstanding the 
earliness of the hour, shone so fiercely that it brought upon me a 
transient fit of delirium, which is scarcely to be wondered at, if my 
previous state of exhaustion be considered.       You will readily conceive
that my situation, under all its circumstances, was not a very enviable 
one; some people would perhaps call it a frightful one.       I did not 
come however to the slightest harm, for the Lord took care of me through 
two of His instruments, Messrs.       Weil and Valentin, highly respectable
Jews of Copenhagen, who had been my fellow-passengers, and with whom I had 
in some degree ingratiated myself on board, in our intervals of ease, by 
conversing with them about the Talmud and the book Sohar.       They 
conveyed me to the K      nig von Engeland, an excellent hotel in the 
street called the Neuenwall, and sent for a physician, who caused me to 
take forty drops of laudanum and my head to be swathed in wet towels, and 
afterwards caused me to be put to bed, where I soon fell asleep, and awoke 
in the evening perfectly recovered and in the best spirits possible.       
This morning, Sunday, I called on the British Consul, Mr. H. Canning, to 
whom I had a letter of recommendation.       He received me with great 
civility, and honoured me with an invitation to dine with him to-morrow, 
which I of course accepted.       He is a highly intelligent man, and 
resembles strikingly in person his illustrious relative, the late George 
Canning.       Since visiting him I have been to one of the five tall 
churches which tower up above the tall houses; I thought its interior very 
venerable and solemn, but the service seemed to be nothing more than a 
low-muttered chanting, from which it was impossible to derive much 
spiritual edification.       There was no sermon, and not more than twenty 
persons were present, though the edifice would contain thousands 
conveniently.       Hamburg is a huge place, and the eastern part of it is 
intersected by wide canals communicating with the Elbe, so that vessels 
find their way into most parts of the city; the bridges are consequently 
very numerous, and are mostly of wood.       Some of the streets are 
planted with trees, which have a pretty appearance, though upon the whole 
it has certainly no claim to the appellation of a handsome town.       But 
no observer can fail to be struck with the liveliness and bustle which 
reign in this emporium of continental Europe, worthy to be compared with 
Tyre of old or our own Liverpool.       Another city adjoins it called 
Altona, the park of which and the environs are the favourite Sunday lounge 
of the Hamburgers.       Altona is in Holstein, which belongs to the Danish
Government.       It is separated from the Hanseatic town merely by a small
gateway, so that it may truly be said here that there is but one step from 
a republic to a monarchy.       Little can be said in commendation of the 
moral state of this part of the world, for rope-dancers were displaying 
their agility in the park to-day, and the dancing-saloons, which I am 
informed are most infamous places, are open to the public this 
evening.       England with all her faults has still some regard to 
decency, and will not tolerate such a shameless display of vice on so 
sacred a season, when a decent cheerfulness is the freest form in which the
mind or countenance ought to invest themselves.       I shall depart for 
Lubeck on the sixth (Tuesday), and shall probably be on the Baltic on my 
way to St. Petersburg on the eighth, which is the day notified for the 
departure the steamboat.       My next letter, provided it pleases the 
Almighty to vouch-safe me a happy arrival, will be from the Russian 
capital; and with a fervent request that you will not forget me in your 
prayers, and that you will present my kind remembrances and best respects 
to Mr. Brandram, and also remember me to Mr. Hattersley and Mr. Tarn, I 
have the honour to remain, Revd. and dear Sir, your most obedient and most 
humble servant,
George Borrow.

[Undated.]
Revd. and dear Sir,       My last letter was 
from Hamburg, which I hope and trust you received.       I started from 
thence on the 24th, and embarking at Travemunde I arrived at the Russian 
capital on the 31st July (old style) after an exceedingly pleasant passage,
accomplished in the short space of 72 hours; for the wind was during the 
greatest part of our way favourable and gentle, the sea being quite as 
smooth as a mill pond, so that the paddles of our noble steamer, the 
Nikolai, were not at all impeded in their working by any rolling or 
pitching of the vessel.       Immediately on my arrival I sought out Mr. 
Swan, one of the most amiable and interesting characters I have ever met 
with, and delivered to him your letter, the contents of which were very 
agreeable to him; for from applying himself too un-interruptedly to 
transcribing the manuscript of the Mandchou Old Testament he had in some 
degree injured his health; and the arrival of a coadjutor in the task was 
exceedingly opportune.       In a day or two I went with him to pay a visit
to Mr. Schmidt, who resides a few miles out of town.       He assured us 
that he had no doubt of permission being granted for the printing of the 
Mandchou New Testament, and promised to make all the necessary inquiries, 
and to inform Mr. Swan and myself of the result.       He was at the time 
we saw him much occupied with his Mongolian Grammar and Dictionary, which 
are in the press.       We have not heard from him since this visit, and I 
shall probably call upon him again in a week or two to hear what steps he 
has taken.       I resided for nearly a fortnight in a hotel, as the 
difficulty of procuring lodgings in this place is very great, and when you 
have procured them, you have to furnish them yourself at a considerable 
expense.       During this time I collated with Mr. Swan the greatest part 
of what he had transcribed, and eventually I took up my abode with Mr. 
Egerton Hubbard, a friend of Mr. Venning       s, where I am for the 
present very comfortably situated, and I do assure you exerting myself to 
the utmost to fulfil the views of the Society.       I have transcribed 
from the Mandchou Old Testament the second book of Chronicles, which when I
had done, I put aside the Old Testament for a season, and by the advice of 
Mr. Swan began to copy St. Matthew       s Gospel from the version of the 
New, executed by the same hand as the Old, with the purpose of comparing it
with that of Mr. Lipoftsoff.       This task I have just completed, and am 
now about to commence a transcript of the Acts.       Respecting this 
manuscript translation of the Old and New Testaments I must here observe, 
that with scarcely one exception it is the most laborious and best executed
work of the kind which I have ever seen, and I cannot but admire the 
diligence and learning of him who, probably unasked and unrewarded, engaged
in and accomplished it.       The style, as far as I can judge, is to an 
eminent degree elegant and polished, and likely to captivate those whose 
taste is cultivated, and with this advantage, it exhibits none of that 
obscurity which too frequently attends refinement of language; and as for 
fidelity       it is upon the whole executed as literally, and with as much
adherence to the original, as the genius of the Tartar language and the 
understandings of the people, for whose edification it is intended, will 
permit.       But the notes and elucidations (which I copy not) which 
follow every chapter, both of the Old and New Testament, constitute the 
most surprising feature of this work.       They are so full and copious, 
that they occupy far more space than the text; indeed, I think I speak 
quite within bounds when I say that for every page of text there are two of
explanatory matter.       The author was a French Jesuit, and when did a 
Jesuit any thing which he undertook, whether laudable or the reverse, not 
far better than any other person?       Staunch Protestant though I be, I 
am not ashamed to say that all the skill and talent of our own 
missionaries, in acquiring languages and making versions of the Scriptures,
are, when compared with the capabilities displayed by the seminary priests,
faint and seemingly insignificant; and yet it is singular enough that the 
labours of the latter in this line have had almost invariably no other fate
than to be buried in continental public libraries or in the literary 
collections of the learned and curious; from which it is manifest that the 
Lord smiled not upon their undertakings.       They thought not of His 
glory but of the glory of their order, and the consequence has been that 
       He has put down the mighty from their seat and has exalted the 
humble and meek.       
A few days since I called upon Mr. Lipoftsoff, and to my surprise 
discovered that he was totally unaware of any plan being in agitation for 
the printing of his translation of the Scriptures.       He said that he 
had had no communication with Mr. Schmidt for several months; and far from 
being able to furnish me with any information respecting the probable 
destiny of his work, he asked questions of me concerning it.       He is a 
gentleman rather advanced in years, probably between sixty and seventy, but
is nevertheless surprisingly hale and robust.       He was very kind, and 
promised to give me any assistance in his power towards acquiring a 
thorough knowledge of the Mandchou; and, permit me to say, that Petersburg 
is the only place in Europe where such a knowledge can be obtained, for the
manuscripts and printed books in that tongue are very plentiful here, and 
there are moreover several individuals who speak and write it.       I of 
course most gladly accepted such an offer, and shall endeavour to turn it 
to the best account.       Mr. L. speaks no European language but Russ, 
which I am not sorry for, because frequent conversation and intercourse 
with him will improve my knowledge of that language.       It is a great 
error to suppose that a person resident in this country can dispense with 
Russ, provided he is acquainted with French and German.       The two 
latter languages, it is true, are spoken by the French and German 
shop-keepers settled here.       French is moreover spoken (to foreigners) 
by the nobility and a few of the officers in the army; but neither are so 
generally understood as in England       German far less so; and as for the
Russians being the best general linguists in Europe, I am totally unable to
guess how the idea could have originated, but am certain from personal 
experience that they are quite the contrary.
Petersburg is the finest city in the world; neither London nor Paris nor
any other European capital which I have visited has sufficient pretensions 
to enter into comparison with it in respect to beauty and grandeur.       
Many of the streets are miles in length, as straight as an arrow and 
adorned with the most superb edifices.       The so-called Nevsky Prospect,
a street which runs from the Admiralty to the Monastery of St. Alexander 
Nevsky, is nearly three miles in length and for the greatest part of the 
way floored with small blocks of wood shaped octagonally.       The broad 
and rapid Neva runs through the centre of this Queen of cities, and on 
either side is a noble quay, from which you have a full view of the river 
and of what is passing on its bosom.       But I will not be diffuse in the
description of objects which have been so often described, but devote the 
following lines which my paper will contain to more important matters.
The lower orders of the Russians are very willing to receive Scriptural 
information, and very willing to purchase it if offered to them at a price 
which comes within their means.       I will give an interesting example of
this.       A young man of the name of Nobbs, in the employ of Mr. Leake, 
an English farmer residing a few versts from Petersburg, is in the 
habit on his return from the latter place, whither he is frequently sent by
his master, to carry with him a satchel filled with Russian New Testaments 
and religious tracts, with which he is supplied by an excellent English 
lady who dwells there.       He says that before he has reached home, he 
has invariably disposed of his whole cargo to the surrounding peasantry; 
and such is the hunger and thirst which they display for the word of 
salvation that his stock has always been insufficient to answer all the 
demands made, after it was known what merchandise he brought with 
him.       There remain at present three hundred copies unsold of the 
modern Russian New Testament at the shop which has the disposal of the 
works of the late Russian Bible Society; these copies, all of which are 
damaged from having been immersed during the inundation of 1824, might all 
be disposed of in one day, provided proper individuals were employed to 
hawk them about in the environs of this capital.       There are twenty 
thousand copies on hand of the Sclavonian Bible, which being in a language 
and character differing materially from the modern Russ character and 
language, and only understood by the learned, is unfit for general 
circulation, and the copies will probably remain unsold, though the Synod 
is more favourable to the distribution of the Scriptures in the ancient 
than in the modern form.       I was informed by the attendant in the shop 
that the Synod had resolved upon not permitting the printing of any fresh 
edition of the Scriptures in the modern Russ until these twenty thousand 
copies in the ancient language had been disposed of.       But it is 
possible that this assertion is incorrect.
I must now conclude; and with an earnest request that you will write to 
me speedily, and deliver my kindest remembrances to Mr. Brandram and to my 
other good friends at the Society House, I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, your
most obedient servant,
G. Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
St. Petersburg, 
August 27, 1833.
Revd. and dear Sir,       The bearer of this 
letter is Mr. Glen, the son of the celebrated missionary of Astracan.      
He is desirous of forming your acquaintance, and I take the liberty of 
making him known to you.       He is a young man of considerable learning, 
and a devout Christian.       His object in visiting England is to qualify 
himself for the missionary calling, in the hope that at some future period 
he may tread in the steps of his father and proclaim a crucified Saviour to
the Oriental heathens.       I am at present, thanks be to the Lord, 
comfortable and happy, and am every day busily engaged in transcribing the 
Mandchou Old Testament and collating with Mr. Swan.
In the hope that these lines will find you in good health, I have the 
honour to remain, Revd. and dear Sir, your most obedient servant,
G. Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd.       Feb. 17th, 
1834)
St. Petersburg, 20th January (old 
style), 1834.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I received in due 
time your epistle of the 2nd January, which gave me considerable pleasure, 
as it is exceedingly cheering in a foreign land to hear from one       s 
friends and to know that one is not forgotten by them.       I now proceed 
to give an account of my stewardship up to the present time, which account 
I humbly trust will afford perfect satisfaction to the Society which has 
honoured a frail creature like myself with a charge, the importance and 
difficulty of which I at present see much more clearly than I originally 
did.
My dear Sir, even when transcribing the Mandchou Scripture, I was far 
from being forgetful of the ulterior object of my mission, and therefore, 
as in duty bound, applied to Dr. Schmidt for advice and information, who 
was the person upon whom I mainly depended.       But I found that 
gentleman so involved in a multiplicity of business that it was utterly 
impossible for him to afford me either; and though he was kind enough to 
promise to make inquiry, etc. etc., it is very probable that he forgot to 
fulfil his promise, for the result never came to my ears.
Thus circumstanced, and being very uneasy in my mind, I determined to 
take a bold step, and directly and without further feeling my way to 
petition the Government in my own name for permission to print the Mandchou
Scriptures.       Having communicated this determination to our beloved, 
sincere, and most truly Christian friend Mr. Swan (who has lately departed 
to his station in Siberia, shielded I trust by the arm of his Master), it 
met with his perfect approbation and cordial encouragement.       I 
therefore drew up a petition, and presented it with my own hand to his 
Excellence Mr. Bludoff, Minister of the Interior.       He having perused 
it, briefly answered, that he believed the matter did not lie with him, but
that he would consider.       I now began greatly to fear that the affair 
would not come to a favourable issue, but nevertheless prayed fervently to 
God, and confiding principally in Him, resolved to leave no human means 
untried which were within my reach.
Since residing here I have assiduously cultivated the friendship of the 
Honourable Mr. Bligh, His Britannic Majesty       s plenipotentiary at the 
Court of Russia, who has shown me many condescending marks of kindness, and
who is a person of superb talents, kind disposition, and of much 
piety.       I therefore, on the evening of the day of my presenting the 
petition, called upon him, and being informed that he was out of town, and 
was not expected till late at night, I left a letter for him, in which I 
entreated him to make use of whatever influence his high official situation
was calculated to give him with the Minister, towards procuring a 
favourable reply; assuring him that the Mandchou version was not intended 
for circulation nor calculated for circulation in any part of the Russian 
Empire, but in China and Chinese Tartary solely.       I stated that I 
would call for an answer the next morning.       I did so, and upon seeing 
Mr. Bligh, he was kind enough to say that if I desired it he would apply 
officially to the Minister, and exert all his influence in his official 
character in order to obtain the accomplishment of my views; but at the 
same time suggested that it would, perhaps, be as well at a private 
interview to beg it as a personal favour; and to this I instantly 
assented.       He spoke twice to Mr. Bludoff upon the subject; and I 
shortly afterwards received a summons to appear at the Asiatic Department, 
whither I went, and found that Mr. Bludoff had been enquiring whether any 
person was to be found capable of being employed as Censor over the work, 
and that it had been resolved that Mr. Lipoftsoff, who is one of the clerks
of the Asiatic Department, should be appointed Censor, and that I should be
the Editor of the work, provided permission were granted to print it.      
I went away, and having received no intelligence during the space of a 
fortnight, I waited upon Mr. Bligh and begged that, provided it were not 
disagreeable to him, he would make a fresh application to the 
Minister.       And, singularly enough, Mr. Bludoff was to dine at Mr. 
Bligh       s that evening, and the latter amiable gentleman assured me 
that he would not let so excellent an opportunity slip of saying what was 
calculated to bring the matter to a conclusion.       That same night I 
received a message, whereby I was requested to wait on Mr. Bludoff the next
day, at one.       I did so, and he received me in the most polite manner 
and said that the matter did not entirely depend upon him, but that it 
would be necessary to obtain the permission also of the Director of 
Worship, that however he would give me a letter to that Dignitary, which he
doubted not would have some effect.       I received the letter, and 
without losing any time repaired to the Director       s Office and having 
delivered my letter, after waiting some time, was told to call at the 
Asiatic Department on the first day of the next week (the very day your 
letter arrived).       On calling there I found that permission had been
granted to print the Mandchou Scripture.
I hope that the honourable Committee and yourself will feel no 
displeasure at my presuming here to make a slight suggestion.       We are 
under great obligations to Mr. Bligh; and I have certainly taken great 
liberties with the friendship with which he has thought proper to favour 
me, liberties which I should certainly not have felt myself authorised to 
have taken in any affair, the end of which was not the glorifying of God, 
as the aim of this certainly is.       I therefore should wish to hint the 
expediency of a letter in which the thanks of the Committee be presented to
Mr. Bligh for the interest which he has been pleased to take in this 
business, and for the trouble he has given himself.       You are well 
aware that a handsome acknowledgement of a kindness received is never taken
amiss; and as it is not impossible that Mr. Bligh, at another time and even
at another place, may have an opportunity of promoting the excellent views 
of the Society, I cannot help thinking that such an acknowledgement would 
be unwise neither in respect to what has occurred or may occur 
hereafter.
In reply to your inquiries respecting my progress in the Mandchou 
language, I have to observe that for some time past I have taken lessons 
from a person who was twelve years in Pekin, and who speaks Mandchou and 
Chinese with fluency.       I pay him about six shillings English for each 
lesson, which I grudge not, for the perfect acquirement of Mandchou is one 
of my most ardent wishes; as I am convinced that it is destined by 
providence to be the medium for the spiritual illumination of countless 
millions of Chinese and Tartars.       At present I can transcribe the 
Manchou character with much greater facility and speed than I can the 
English.       I can translate from it with tolerable facility, and have 
translated into it, for an exercise, the second homily of the Church of 
England        On the Misery of Man.              I have likewise 
occasionally composed a few hymns in this language, the difficulty of which
I am at present more fully aware of than when I left England.       It is 
one of those deceitful tongues, the seeming simplicity of whose structure 
induces you to suppose, after applying to them for a month or two, that 
little more remains to be learned, but which, should you continue to study 
a year, as I have studied this, show themselves to you in their veritable 
colours, amazing you with their copiousness, puzzling with their 
idioms.       In a word Mandchou is equally as difficult as Sanscrit or 
Persian, neither of which languages has ever been thoroughly acquired by 
any European, though at first acquaintance they flatter the student with 
their deceitful simplicity.       I take the liberty of sending you a short
original epigram in rhymed Mandchou, which if it answers no other purpose 
will afford you some idea of my running Mandchou hand, which, as I now 
write perpendicularly, is very different from that hand which I wrote 
previously to my coming hither.       The epigram is upon the exploits of 
the Tartars.
[Here follow four upright lines in Manchu characters.]
Milites qui e Manjurico deserto exierunt, bellando silvas, campos et 
oppida Sinensis imperii captarunt.
Want of room obliges me to defer making a report upon Mr. 
Lipoftsoff       s translation until my next letter, which will follow in a
week or two; for I am unwilling in a matter of such immense importance to 
deliver a brief and hurried opinion.       I have much to communicate also 
respecting the proper means to be pursued for the introduction and 
circulation of the volume, when printed, in China and Tartary.       This 
information I have derived from the most authentic sources, namely from 
individuals who have spent many years in these countries, and whose 
acquaintance I have eagerly sought.
From England I have lately received a letter in which is an extract from
an epistle of my brother in Mexico, amounting to this       that there is 
no native language in that country entitled to the appellation of 
the Mexican language; that it is as incorrect to make use of such an
expression, as it would be to say definitely the European language; 
that setting aside the Spanish there are upwards of twenty languages and 
dialects spoken in Mexico, none of which are read (except perhaps here and 
there by a few individuals) but communicated by the mouth and only acquired
by the ear; that my brother has shown the sheet of St. Luke       s Gospel,
which I transmitted to him, to various Spaniards and Indians, but it was 
unintelligible to them, the latter not recognising the words when read to 
them.       I should therefore advise that the copies of this version be 
sent, if possible, to the place where the version was purchased, as it was 
probably made in the language or dialect of that place or neighbourhood, 
and where there is a chance of its being of some utility.       Should my 
brother have survived the late dreadful commotions in Mexico, I have no 
doubt that he will be exceedingly happy to assist in flinging the rays of 
Scriptural light over that most benighted and miserable region; but having 
lately read in the Russian newspapers that the town of Guanajuato, where he
resided, has been taken and sacked by the murderous bands of the 
insurgents, I have great reason to fear that his earthly course is 
terminated, for the former, incited by their demoniacal priests, in 
comparison with whom the Shamans of Manjuria and the lamas of Mongolia and 
China are innocent and holy, lay hold of every opportunity of shedding the 
blood of Protestants and foreigners.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd. March 10th, 1834, with
Report on the Mandchou New Testament.)
St. Petersburg, Galernoy 
Ulitza,
4 February (old style) 1834.
Revd. and dear Sir,       In compliance with 
the request of the Committee, expressed in your epistle of the 2nd January,
I herewith send a report upon Mr. Lipoftsoff       s translation; and as 
there were many things which I wished to mention in my last letter, but was
unable from want of room, I take this opportunity of stating them, with the
hope that they will meet with your approbation.
In the first place, whatever communication you wish to make to Mr. 
Lipoftsoff I think you had best charge me with to him, for in that case you
will be certain that he will receive it, without loss of time.       But I 
must inform you that he is rather a singular man, and to all appearances 
perfectly indifferent to the fate of his excellent translation, caring 
nothing whether it be published as a powerful instrument to open the closed
eyes and soften the hard hearts of the idolators of China and Tartary, or 
whether it be committed to the flames, and for ever lost to the 
world.       You cannot conceive the cold, heartless apathy in respect to 
the affair, on which I have been despatched hither as an assistant, 
which I have found in people, to whom I looked, not unreasonably, for 
encouragement and advice.       But thanks be to the Lord, the great object
has been accomplished, permission has been obtained to print the New 
Testament, and have no doubt that permission for the whole Bible is within 
our reach.       And in regard to what we have yet to do, let it be borne 
in mind, that we are by no means dependent upon Mr. Lipoftsoff; though 
certainly to secure the services which he is capable of performing would be
highly desirable, and though he cannot act outwardly in the character of 
Editor, he having been appointed Censor, he may privately be of great 
utility to us.       Therefore let the attempt to engage his services be 
made without delay.
At the Sarepta House is a chest containing Mandchou characters, 
belonging to the Bible Society, which I shall cause to be examined for the 
purpose of ascertaining whether they have sustained any injury from rust 
during the long time they have been lying neglected; if any of them have, 
my learned friend Baron Schilling, who is in possession of a small fount of
Mandchou types for the convenience of printing trifles in that tongue, has 
kindly promised to assist us with the use of as many of his own as may be 
necessary.       There is one printing office here, where they are in the 
habit of printing with the Mongolian character, which differs but little 
from the Mandchou; consequently the Mongolian compositors will be competent
to the task of composing in Mandchou.       There are no Mandchou types in 
St. Petersburg, with the exception of our own and Baron 
Schilling       s.
I suppose that it will be thought requisite to print the town for a year
or so, it is my humble opinion, and the opinion of much wiser people, that 
if he were active, zealous and likewise courageous, the blessings resulting
from his labours would be incalculable.       It would be by no means a 
difficult thing to make excursions into Tartary and to form friendships 
amongst the Tartar hordes, and I am far from certain that with a little 
management and dexterity he would be unable to penetrate even to Pekin, and
to return in safety, after having examined the state of the land.       I 
can only say that if it were my fortune to have the opportunity, I would 
make the attempt, and should consider myself only to blame if I did not 
succeed.
In my last letter I informed you that I had procured myself an 
instructor in Mandchou, and that I was making tolerable progress in the 
language.       I should now wish to ask whether this person could not be 
turned to some further account; for example, to assist me in making a 
translation into Mandchou of the Psalms and Isaiah, which have not yet been
rendered.       A few shillings a week, besides what I give him for my own 
benefit, would secure his co-operation, for he is a person in very low 
circumstances.       He is not competent to undertake any thing of the kind
by himself, being in many respects very simple and ignorant; but as an 
assistant I think he might be of considerable utility, and that between us 
we could produce a version which, although it might not be particularly 
elegant, would be clear, grammatical and faithful to the original.       In
the mean time I shall pursue my studies, and be getting every thing in 
readiness for setting the printers at work; and with a humble request for 
speedy instructions, in order that as little time as possible may be
lost in the work of the Lord, I have the honour to remain, Revd. and dear 
Sir,
Your most obedient and humble servant,
George Borrow.
P.S.       My kindest regards to Mr. Brandram and my other dear friends 
at the Bible House.       I thank you heartily for your kind advice in the 
latter part of your last epistle.       Do me the favour to inform Dr. 
Richardson that I have followed his instructions in regard to clothing, 
etc., and have derived great benefit therefrom.
To the Rev. Joseph Jowett
(Endorsed: recd. March ---, 1834)
St. Petersburg, Febry. 15 (old style), 
1834.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Having forgotten in
my last letter to say something which I intended, I take the liberty of 
troubling you with these lines.       But first of all I must apologise for
certain slips of the pen in the Report which I transmitted; for it left me 
without having been corrected, Baron Schilling having called upon me just 
as I sat down to the task, and when he had departed, I had barely time to 
seal it and despatch it by that week       s post.       There was in it, I
believe, nothing of much importance which required alteration, but, if I 
mistake not, I had written, in the third side, vibebam, instead of 
viverem, and unaparelled, or some such word, instead of 
unparalleled, in the fourth.       Now to the point.
What is to be done with the transcript of Puerot       s translation of 
the Acts of the Apostles, which I made, and which is now in my 
possession?       The translation is in every respect an admirable one; 
clear, faithful, and elegant.       It would not do to print it in lieu of 
Mr. Lipoftsoff       s translation of that part of the New Testament; 
because the styles of the two individuals are so different, that to mix up 
the writings of the one with those of the other would only serve to 
disfigure the work, and Mr. Lipoftsoff       s translation is well worthy 
of being printed separately and entire; but I conceive that we possess a 
treasure in Puerot       s writings, and that it would be a great pity to 
hide any portion of them from the world.       Pray communicate this hint 
to the Committee, and pardon me for troubling you.
I remain, Rev. and dear Sir, most sincerely yours,
G. Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd, May 16th, 1834)
Galernoy Ulitza, St. 
Petersburg,
15th April (old style) 1834.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Upon the receipt of
your letter of the [21st] ult. [date omitted], I lost no time in 
endeavouring to obtain the necessary information upon the points to which 
you directed my attention; and I have some hope that what I am about to 
communicate will not be altogether unsatisfactory; but I must first of all 
state that it was not acquired in a day, and that I have been obliged to go
to many people and many places, which will account for my not having sooner
returned an answer.
First, respecting the most important point, the expense of printing the 
New Testament in Mandchou.       I was quite terrified at the enormous sums
which some of the printers to whom I made application required for the 
work.       At length our friend Dr. Schmidt recommended me to the 
University Press, and I having spoken to the directors of the 
establishment, they sent me in the course of a week an estimate which 
neither Dr. Schmidt nor myself considered to be unreasonable, and of this 
estimate I here subjoin a translation:

To Mr. Borrow.
       After much consultation with the compositor, I have come to the 
following result concerning the Mandchou business about which you consulted
me.       If the work be printed on as thin paper as that of the original, 
it can only be printed on one side.       Now supposing that the size is to
be folio like that of the original, two sides will make a sheet, and the 
price of composition will be 26 roubles, 20 copecks       that is to say; 
12R. to the compositor, wages 2R. 50c., percentage to the printing office 
11R. 60c., making 26R. 20c.       The printing of 1000 on one side 2R. 
50c., percentage 2R., making 4R. 50c.       Thus for composition and 
printing 30R. 60c. for 1000; for 2000, 35R. 10c.; for 3000, 39R. 
60c.       
Your very obedient servant,
K      rler.       

In the meantime I had become acquainted with two German printers, 
Schultz and Beneze, who being young men and just entered into business are 
very eager to obtain the printing of a work of such importance, which they 
hope will serve to bring them into notice, as well as being advantageous to
them in a pecuniary view.       The difference, as to the expense of 
printing, in the estimate made by these gentlemen and that of the 
University Press, will doubtless as much surprise you, as it did me.       
Here it follows:

       In respect to the printing of the New Testament in the Manchou 
language, the undersigned oblige themselves to undertake the printing of 
the said work.       In the first place, as the Bible Society, and in 
particular their agent Mr. Borrow, think fit to furnish the printers with 
the necessary types and paper, the undersigned offer to supply the sheet 
consisting of four pages with composition, clean and black printing, at the
rate of 25 roubles, paper currency, for a thousand copies; for two thousand
copies, five additional roubles assignats, so that the same sheet, only by 
a greater edition, amounts to 30 roubles assignats; thirdly, for 3000 
copies in the above proportion, 35 roubles.       Fourthly, we promise 
during the interval of a certain period to supply at the rate of three 
sheets per week.
Schultz       Beneze.       

You will perceive that the amount of this estimate is less, by more than
one-half, than the amount of the other.       Schultz and Beneze       s 
sheet consists of four sides, and they charge less for it than the printers
of the University charge for theirs which consists only of two.       I 
should therefore think that upon this ground they are entitled to the 
preference, were there nothing else to recommend them, which, in my humble 
opinion, there is; for being young beginners, and not having very much to 
do, they are more likely to push the work forward, than a firm overwhelmed 
with business, from whom, whatever might be promised, a sheet per week is 
the utmost to be expected, by which much valuable time must be lost.       
Dr. Schmidt is acquainted with Messrs. S.       B., and highly approves of 
their being employed.
Secondly, concerning paper, with which the printer has no concern.      
I can as yet say little for certain upon this matter, which has been the 
occasion of no little trouble and expense; for I have been obliged to take 
no less than three journeys to Peterhof, a town about 30 versts 
distant, where stands the paper manufactory, for there is no such paper as
we want in the Russian capital.       In this manufactory they have about 
50 stopes or reams (we should require ten times that quantity for 
only 1000 copies) of the very paper, I believe, on which the Mandchou 
Gospel of St. Matthew was printed, and some of the workmen said that they 
could make as much more as should be required.       Concerning the price 
of this paper, I could obtain no positive information, for the director and
first and second clerks were invariably absent, and the place abandoned to 
ignorant understrappers (according to the custom of Russia).       And 
notwithstanding I found out the director in Petersburg, he himself could 
not tell me the price, but informed me that he would inquire, and speedily 
send me word; but as I have as yet heard nothing from him, I write lest it 
should be supposed in England that I am sleeping on my station.       I 
shall write again in a few days on this point; in the mean time you 
would oblige me by causing the accounts of Dr. Pinkerton       s expenses 
to be referred to, for the purpose of ascertaining how much he paid per
ream for this kind of paper.       I believe it to be extravagantly dear, 
at least five times dearer than good common paper, which can be procured 
for fifteen roubles per ream; and if that be the case, common paper must be
used and the book printed in the common fashion, unless the Society be 
prepared to disburse thousands instead of hundreds; for if the work were 
printed on this Chinese paper, four times more paper would be required than
if it were printed on the other, as five multiplied by four make twenty, 
the expense of paper would be twenty times greater.
Thirdly, respecting Mr. Lipoftsoff, with whom I have of late had much 
conversation.       He has behaved very handsomely.       He has made an 
immense number of alterations in his translation, all of which are 
excellent improvements, and all these are to be at our disposal 
gratis.       He says that he cannot receive any remuneration for looking 
over the work, being bound to do so as Censor.       I shall therefore edit
it, and have the supervision of the proof sheets, which he will peruse last
of all.       He having examined me in Mandchou did me the honour to say I 
required no assistance at all; but should the Committee and yourself be of 
opinion that it would be advisable to procure a little, the 
       pundit        would be very happy for an extra six or seven 
shillings per week to collate with me when wanted.       I have derived 
great benefit from this man, who though in many respects a most singular 
and uncouth being speaks Mandchou gallantly, with the real pronunciation of
Pekin, which differs considerably from that of Pekhan (the 
desert), being far more soft and melodious.       During the interval which
will elapse between my writing to you and hearing from you, I shall borrow 
from Baron Schilling the Mandchou Old Testament and reperuse the notes in 
order to be able to give a suitable opinion as to their value.       My 
present opinion of them is no mean one.       In answer to your query 
respecting the transcript of the Old Testament, I beg leave to 
inform you that it is in the hands of a Mr. Merrilies, an English merchant,
to whom Mr. Swan entrusted it.       I believe he starts for England by the
first steam-boat.
I have the honour to remain, Revd. and dear Sir, sincerely yours,
George Borrow.
P.S.       Since my last letter I have been laid up for some time with a
nervous fever, but thank God I am quite recovered.       My best respects 
to Mr. Brandram.       Pray excuse the haste in which this letter is 
written, it will be barely in time for the post.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd. May 26th, 1834)
st. Petersburg, April 28 (old style) 1834.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Being at length 
able to communicate some positive information respecting the price of the 
paper, which we are in need of, I lose no time in doing so.       The day 
after I despatched my last epistle, which I hope you have received, I was 
favoured with a communication from the director of the Peterhof Fabrik or 
Manufactory, a gentleman who amongst other titles bears that of Councillor 
of State.       He was kind enough to say that I should have the 50 reams 
of paper which remained, and which I before alluded to, at 75 roubles per 
ream; but that if any more were necessary, one hundred roubles per ream 
would be required, and not any reduction would be made.       You may 
easily guess that I was somewhat startled at this piece of information, for
upon making a calculation I found that one ream of paper would be little 
more than sufficient for two copies of the entire Mandchou New 
Testament.       There are 480 sheets in a Russian ream, and I suppose that
our book will consist of seven parts, each containing about the same number
of sheets as the printed Mandchou Gospel of St. Matthew.       Now that 
Gospel contains 31 sheets, and 31 multiplied by 7 amounts to 211 
[sic], which multiplied by 2 makes 422 sheets, leaving only a 
surplus of 58.       Therefore the paper necessary for 1000 copies only 
would amount to about 450 reams, the price of which, after allowance had 
been made for the 50 reams at 75 roubles, would exceed 40,000 
roubles.       The next day I hired a calash, and spent the best part of a 
week in causing myself to be driven to all the places in the vicinity of 
Petersburg where paper is made.       Knowing but too well that it is the 
general opinion of the people of this country that Englishmen are made of 
gold, and that it is only necessary to ask the most extravagant price for 
any article in order to obtain it, I told no person, to whom I applied, who
I was, or of what country; and I believe I was supposed to be a 
German.       In some places I had now the pleasure of hearing that I could
have the paper at 60 roubles per ream.       At last I came to a person 
whom, after having informed him that I was in need of a very great 
quantity, perhaps a thousand reams or more, I beat down from 50 to 40 
roubles, from 40 to 35, and it is probable that I may be able to obtain a 
large quantity at 30.       I must inform you that I also employed two 
agents, and we three going various ways have ascertained that the necessary
paper may be procured for between 30 and 40 roubles per ream, paper of as 
good a quality       nay, better than that on which the Gospel of St. 
Matthew was printed, and that for which 100 roubles were demanded at 
Peterhof.       It is therefore now time for the Committee to come to a 
decision respecting the number of copies to be printed, and I wish it to be
borne in mind that the price of the paper per ream in some degree depends 
upon the quantity required.       I do not think it possible to obtain any 
where paper of a similar quality at a less price than 30 or 35 roubles; for
the specimens which I have obtained are very beautiful, and a work printed 
on such paper need not be ashamed to show its face amongst the most 
fastidious Tartars and Chinese.       To print the Testament on common 
paper would certainly not be advisable, as in that case the probability is 
that notwithstanding the reverence of those singular people for written or 
printed characters, the sacred volume, if put into their hands, would be 
destroyed.
I am in conformity with your expressed desire getting every thing into 
readiness for commencing printing, and therefore earnestly beg for a speedy
communication, informing me how much paper I am to bespeak, and in what 
manner I am to pay for it.       I must here observe that in all dealings 
within Russia the purchaser must have his money ready in his hand; 
consequently, if I am authorised to purchase any quantity of paper, I must 
have a letter of credit upon some firm here resident, that I may be able to
pay for the article immediately upon its delivery.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
George Borrow.
P.S.       With respect to the paper, if purchased; would you have me 
deliver the whole of it into the printer       s hands at once, or should a
small apartment be hired in which to keep part of it until wanted?       In
this country the wisdom of the serpent is quite as necessary as the 
innocence of the dove.

My dear Sir,       I am exceedingly sorry 
that you should have had the trouble of writing to me to no purpose; for in
respect to the letter, which it seems by your favour of the 29th ult. you 
committed to a private hand to be forwarded to me, I beg leave to state 
that I have never received it, or heard anything of it.       I must 
earnestly intreat that in future all letters relating to business be 
despatched by the regular post, otherwise great inconvenience and 
misunderstanding will be the result.       Private individuals seldom give 
themselves the slightest trouble to deliver letters.       If they chance 
to fall in with the persons for whom they are intended       well and good!
if not, the letters are flung aside and forgotten.       In respect to the 
monies furnished me by our friend Mr. Tarn for my journey I have sent an 
account of the disbursement on the other side, and also of what I have 
expended already upon the Mandchou New Testament, of which St. 
Matthew       s Gospel has been completed and St. Mark       s entered 
upon.
I remain, my dear Sir, most truly yours,
George Borrow.

My dear Sir,       At the expiration of this 
quarter I shall draw for the sum of        47, 11s. 6d. instead of the 
usual        50, whereby my account with you will be liquidated.       I 
have, according to your suggestion when we parted, deducted the salary of 
the days passed in journeying from the money which I received from you, 
Messrs. Simondsen having received advice to pay me from the day of my 
arrival at St. Petersburg, whereas by the words of my agreement (see books)
the salary commences from the time of embarcation.       I believe, 
previous to my departure, that I accounted to you for the sums advanced for
passports.       I have had the good fortune, as I suppose you are aware, 
to procure for 25 roubles per ream the paper for which I was originally 
asked 60, and of which previously the very lowest price has ever been 
35.       This paper is far superior to that for which the Society formerly
paid 40 (and which was not dear at 40), being far stronger and more 
glossy.       You will particularly oblige me by taking care that Messrs. 
Simondsen       s drafts are honored without the slightest delay.       If 
I were unable to pay for the paper at the stated time I should probably be 
arrested, and, what would be far more lamentable, the contract with the 
merchants would be broken; and upon a fresh contract I could not obtain the
paper in question for less than 60 roubles per ream, for the winter has 
already come upon us, during which most of the paper manufactories are at a
stand-still, and an order for paper would be consequently given under every
possible disadvantage.       I have forwarded, according to your desire, an
account of the sums of money hitherto drawn for, and of the manner in which
they have been disbursed.       I intended to have reserved my account for 
Christmas, by which season I hope, with the blessing of God, to have 
brought out the four Gospels.       Excuse these hasty lines, and believe 
me, dear Sir, ever yours,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd. Nov. 10th, 1834)
St. Petersburg, Oct. 8 [old style], 
1834.
I have just received your most kind epistle, the perusal of which has 
given me both pain and pleasure       pain that from unavoidable 
circumstances I have been unable to gratify eager expectation, and pleasure
that any individual should have been considerate enough to foresee my 
situation and to make allowance for it.       The nature of my occupations 
during the last two months and a half has been such as would have entirely 
unfitted me for correspondence, had I been aware that it was necessary, 
which, on my sacred word, I was not.       Now, and only now, when by the 
blessing of God I have surmounted all my troubles and difficulties, I will 
tell, and were I not a Christian I should be proud to tell, what I have 
been engaged upon and accomplished during the last ten weeks.       I have 
been working in the printing-office, as a common compositor, between ten 
and thirteen hours every day during that period; the result of this is that
St. Matthew       s Gospel, printed from such a copy as I believe nothing 
was ever printed from before, has been brought out in the Mandchou 
language; two rude Esthonian peasants, who previously could barely compose 
with decency in a plain language which they spoke and were accustomed to, 
have received such instruction that with ease they can each compose at the 
rate of a sheet a day in the Mandchou, perhaps the most difficult language 
for composition in the whole world; considerable progress has also been 
made in St. Mark       s Gospel, and I will venture to promise, provided 
always the Almighty smiles upon the undertaking, that the entire work of 
which I have the superintendence will be published within eight months from
the present time.       Now, therefore, with the premise that I most 
unwillingly speak of myself and what I have done and suffered for some time
past, all of which I wished to keep locked up in my own breast, I will give
a regular and circumstantial account of my proceedings from the day when I 
received your letter, by which I was authorised by the Committee to bespeak
paper, engage with a printer, and cause our type to be set in order.
My first care was to endeavour to make suitable arrangements for the 
obtaining of Chinese paper.       Now those who reside in England, the most
civilised and blessed of countries, where everything is to be obtained at a
fair price, have not the slightest idea of the anxiety and difficulty 
which, in a country like this, harass the foreigner who has to disburse 
money not his own, if he wish that his employers be not shamefully and 
outrageously imposed upon.       In my last epistle to you I stated that I 
had been asked 100 roubles per ream for such paper as we wanted.       I 
likewise informed you that I believed that it was possible to procure it 
for 35 roubles, notwithstanding our Society had formerly paid 40 roubles 
for worse paper than the samples I was in possession of.       Now I have 
always been of opinion than in the expending of money collected for sacred 
purposes, it behoves the agent to be extraordinarily circumspect and 
sparing.       I therefore was determined, whatever trouble it might cost 
me, to procure for the Society unexceptionable paper at a yet more 
reasonable rate than 35 roubles.       I was aware, that an acquaintance of
mine, a young Dane, was particularly intimate with one of the first 
printers of this city, who is accustomed to purchase vast quantities of 
paper every month for his various publications.       I gave this young 
gentleman a specimen of the paper I required, and desired him (he was under
obligations to me) to enquire of his friend, as if from curiosity, 
the least possible sum per ream at which the printer himself (who 
from his immense demand for paper should necessarily obtain it cheaper than
any one else) could expect to purchase the article in question.       The 
answer I received within a day or two was 25 roubles.       Upon hearing 
this I prevailed upon my acquaintance to endeavour to persuade his friend 
to bespeak the paper at 25 roubles, and to allow me, notwithstanding I was 
a perfect stranger, to have it at that price.       All this was brought 
about.       I was introduced to the printer, Mr. Pluchard, by the Dane, 
Mr. Hasfeldt, and between the former gentleman and myself a contract was 
made to the effect that by the end of October he should supply me with 450 
reams of Chinese paper at 25 roubles per ream, the first delivery to be 
made on the 1st of August; for as my order was given at an advanced period 
of the year, when all the paper manufactories were at full work towards the
executing of orders already received, it was but natural that I should 
verify the old apophthegm,        Last come, last served.              As 
no orders are attended to in Russia unless money be advanced upon them, I 
deposited in the hands of Mr. Pluchard the sum of 2000 roubles, receiving 
his receipt for that amount.
Having arranged this most important matter to my satisfaction, I turned 
my attention to the printing process.       I accepted the offer of Messrs.
Schultz and Beneze to compose and print the Mandchou Testament at the rate 
of 25 roubles per sheet, and caused our fount of type to be conveyed to 
their office.       I wish to say here a few words respecting the state in 
which these types came into my possession.       I found them in a kind of 
warehouse, or rather cellar.       They had been originally confined in two
cases; but these having burst, the type lay on the floor trampled amidst 
mud and filth.       They were, moreover, not improved by having been 
immersed within the waters of the inundation of        27 [1824].       I 
caused them all to be collected and sent to their destination, where they 
were purified and arranged       a work of no small time and difficulty, at
which I was obliged to assist.       Not finding with the type what is 
called        Durchschuss        by the printers here, consisting of leaden
wedges of about six ounces weight each, which form the spaces between the 
lines, I ordered 120 pounds weight of those at a rouble a pound, being 
barely enough for three sheets.       I had now to teach the compositors 
the Mandchou alphabet, and to distinguish one character from another.      
This occupied a few days, at the end of which I gave them the commencement 
of St. Matthew       s Gospel to copy.       They no sooner saw the work 
they were called upon to perform than there were loud murmurs of 
dissatisfaction, and . . . [four Russian words] which means        It is 
quite impossible to do the like,        was the cry       and no 
wonder.       The original printed Gospel had been so interlined and 
scribbled upon by the author in a hand so obscure and irregular, that, 
accustomed as I was to the perusal of the written Mandchou, it was not 
without the greatest difficulty that I could decipher the new matter 
myself.       Moreover, the corrections had been so carelessly made that 
they themselves required far more correction than the original 
matter.       I was therefore obliged to be continually in the 
printing-office, and to do three parts of the work myself.       For some 
time I found it necessary to select every character with my own fingers, 
and to deliver it to the compositor, and by so doing I learnt myself to 
compose.       We continued in this way till all our characters were 
exhausted, for no paper had arrived.       For two weeks and more we were 
obliged to pause, the want of paper being insurmountable.       At the end 
of this period came six reams; but partly from the manufacturers not being 
accustomed to make this species of paper, and partly from the excessive 
heat of the weather which caused it to dry too fast, only one ream and a 
half could be used, and this was not enough for one sheet; the rest I 
refused to take, and sent back.       The next week came fifteen 
reams.       This paper, from the same causes, was as bad as the 
last.       I selected four reams, and sent the rest back.       But this 
paper enabled us to make a beginning, which we did not fail to do, though 
we received no more for upwards of a fortnight, which caused another 
pause.       At the end of that time, owing to my pressing remonstrances 
and entreaties, a regular supply of about twelve reams per week of most 
excellent paper commenced.       This continued until we had composed the 
last five sheets of St. Matthew, when some paper arrived which in my 
absence was received by Mr. Beneze, who, without examining it, as was his 
duty, delivered it to the printers to use in the printing of the said 
sheets, who accordingly printed upon part of it.       But the next day, 
when my occupation permitted me to see what they were about, I observed 
that the last paper was of a quality very different from that which had 
been previously sent.       I accordingly instantly stopped the press, and,
notwithstanding eight reams had been printed upon, I sent all the strange 
paper back, and caused Mr. Beneze to recompose three sheets, which had been
broken up, at his own expense.       But this caused the delay of another 
week.
This last circumstance made me determine not to depend in future for 
paper on one manufactory alone.       I therefore stated to Mr. P[luchard] 
that, as his people were unable to furnish me with the article fast enough,
I should apply to others for 250 reams, and begged him to supply me with 
the rest as fast as possible.       He made no objection.       Thereupon I
prevailed upon my most excellent friend, Baron Schilling, to speak to his 
acquaintance, State-Councillor Alquin, who is possessed of a paper 
manufactory, on the subject.       M. Alquin, as a personal favour to Baron
Schilling (whom, I confess, I was ashamed to trouble upon such an affair, 
and should never have done so had not zeal for the cause induced 
me), consented to furnish me with the required paper on the same terms as 
Mr. P.       At present there is not the slightest risk of the progress of 
our work being retarded       at present, indeed, the path is quite easy; 
but the trouble, anxiety, and misery which have till lately harassed me, 
alone in a situation of great responsibility, have almost reduced me
to a skeleton.
My dearest Sir, do me the favour to ask our excellent Committee, Would 
it have answered any useful purpose if, instead of continuing to struggle 
with difficulties and using my utmost to overcome them, I had written in 
the following strain       and what else could I have written if I had 
written at all?              I was sent out to St. Petersburg to assist Mr.
Lipoftsoff in the editing of the Mandchou Testament.       That gentleman, 
who holds three important situations under the Russian Government, 
and who is far advanced in years, has neither time, inclination, or 
eyesight for the task, and I am apprehensive that my strength and powers 
unassisted are incompetent to it        (praised be the Lord, they were 
not!),        therefore I should be glad to return home.       Moreover the
compositors say that they are unaccustomed to compose in an unknown tongue 
from such scribbled and illegible copy, and they will scarcely assist me to
compose.       Moreover the working printers say (several went away in 
disgust) that the paper on which they have to print is too thin to be 
wetted, and that to print on dry requires a two-fold exertion of strength, 
and that they will not do such work for double wages, for it ruptures 
them.              Would that have been a welcome communication to the 
Committee?       Would that have been a communication suited to the 
public?       I was resolved        to do or die,        and, instead of 
distressing and perplexing the Committee with complaints, to write nothing 
until I could write something perfectly satisfactory, as I now can; and to 
bring about that result I have spared neither myself nor my own 
money.       I have toiled in a close printing-office the whole day, during
90 degrees of heat, for the purpose of setting an example, and have bribed 
people to work whom nothing but bribes would induce so to do.
I am obliged to say all this in self-justification.       No member of 
the Bible Society would ever have heard a syllable respecting what I have 
undergone but for the question,        What has Mr. Borrow been 
about?              I hope and trust that question is now answered to the 
satisfaction of those who do Mr. Borrow the honour to employ him.       In 
respect to the expense attending the editing of such a work as the New 
Testament in Mandchou, I beg leave to observe that I have obtained the 
paper, the principal source of expense, at fifteen roubles per ream less 
than the Society paid formerly for it       that is to say, at nearly half 
the price.
As St. Matthew       s Gospel has been ready for some weeks, it is high 
time that it should be bound; for if that process be delayed, the paper 
with be dirtied and the work injured.       I am sorry to inform you that 
book-binding in Russia is incredibly dear, and that the expenses attending 
the binding of the Testament would amount, were the usual course pursued, 
to two-thirds of the entire expenses of the work.       Various 
book-binders to whom I have applied have demanded one rouble and a half for
the binding of every section of the work, so that the sum required for the 
binding of one Testament alone would be twelve roubles.       Dr. Schmidt 
assured me that one rouble and forty copecks, or, according to the English 
currency, fourteenpence halfpenny, were formerly paid for the binding of 
every individual copy of St. Matthew       s Gospel.       I pray you, my 
dear Sir, to cause the books to be referred to, for I wish to know if that 
statement be correct.       In the meantime arrangements have been made, 
and the Society will have to pay for each volume of the Testament the 
comparatively small sum of forty-five copecks, or fourpence halfpenny, 
whereas the usual price here for the most paltry covering of the most 
paltry pamphlet is fivepence.       Should it be demanded how I have been 
able to effect this, my reply is that I have had little hand in the 
matter.       A nobleman, who honours me with particular friendship, and 
who is one of the most illustrious ornaments of Russia and of Europe, has, 
at my request, prevailed on his own book-binder, over whom he has much 
influence, to do the work on these terms.       That nobleman is Baron 
Schilling.
Commend me to our most respected Committee.       Assure them that in 
whatever I have done or left undone, I have been influenced by a desire to 
promote the glory of the Trinity and to give my employers ultimate and 
permanent satisfaction.       If I have erred, it has been from a defect of
judgment, and I ask pardon of God and them.
In the course of a week I shall write again, and give a further account 
of my proceedings, for I have not communicated one-tenth of what I have to 
impart; but I can write no more now.       It is two hours past 
midnight.       The post goes away to-morrow, and against that morrow I 
have to examine and correct three sheets of St. Mark       s Gospel, which 
lie beneath the paper on which I am writing.       With my best regards to 
Mr. Brandram, I remain, dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. Borrow.
P.S.       I wrote to Mr. Jackson and Mr. Tarn last week.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd. Nov. 14, 1834)
St. Petersburg, Oct. 13th (old 
style) 1834.
Reverend and dear Sir,       In pursuance of 
the promise given in my epistle of last week, which I trust in the Lord you
have received, I again address you.       In the first place I must intreat
you to peruse and to read to the Committee the enclosed Latin certificate 
penned by Mr. Lipoftsoff, a gentleman as little inclined to be prodigal of 
praise, as was of old the learned Scaliger himself, to whom in many points 
indeed, he bears no faint resemblance.       In the second place, I must 
inform you that a few hurried lines are all that I can afford to write at 
present; my proof sheets are rushing in so fast that time is exceedingly 
precious to me, and I grudge every moment that is not devoted to my Maker 
or to my great undertaking.
Before this letter reaches you St. Mark       s Gospel will have passed 
through the press.       The two remaining Gospels will be printed before 
the arrival of Christmas, and by the first of May the entire New Testament,
in the Mandchou language, will have been published.       I wish this 
intelligence to be communicated to the public, who are at liberty, provided
the Lord does not visit me with some heavy affliction, to hold me culpable,
if my assertion is belied by the event.
It is true that were I to pursue the common practice of editors, it 
would be impossible to complete the work in less than two years; the 
quantity of proofs, successively required for every sheet, fail not, in 
general, to retard the progress of all such undertakings.       My beloved 
friend Mr. Swan published in this city a small tract in Mongolian; he found
that it was absolutely necessary to demand six proofs of every sheet, for 
in the second, nay the third proof, there were frequently as many errors as
in the first, from the compositors not being able properly to read the 
corrections.       But I never entrust the task of making alterations in 
the press to other hands than my own.       Having corrected the first 
proof at home, I proceed to the printing office and rectify all errors 
myself.       I consequently never require more than two proofs; the 
second, which I generally show to Mr. Lipoftsoff, is frequently 
faultless.       I am so perfectly convinced of the excellence of this 
plan, that it is my firm intention to pursue it in whatever foreign, or 
even English works, it may be my destiny to edit.
I wish now to say a few words upon a subject, on which I have previously
said something.       At the present moment my principal inducement to such
a step is the observation every now and then made to me, both by Christians
and no Christians, namely:        You are printing Testaments for which you
will never find readers.       Do not tell us that you can distribute them 
at Canton and its environs, or on the coasts of China; there are not ten 
individuals amongst a million of the aboriginal Chinese, and such 
constitute the inhabitants of Canton, of the coasts and of the isles, who 
understand the language in which your Testaments are printed.       If you 
wish for readers you must seek them amongst the masters of Pekin and the 
fierce hordes of desert Tartary; but what means do you possess for 
introducing them to Tartary or Pekin?              I stated in a former 
letter that the town of Kiachta, upon the northern frontier of China, 
appeared to me to be in many respects a suitable head-quarters for any 
person on whom might devolve the task of endeavouring to supply the 
Mandchou Tartars with the word of life in their own language.       I am 
still of opinion, and so are many individuals much more experienced than 
myself, that if a passport could be obtained from the Russian Government, 
the Bible Society would do well in despatching an agent to Kiachta, to see 
what might be done at, or rather from, that place in the great cause.      
Kiachta is little more than 800 miles from Pekin, and not more than half 
that distance from Manjuria; he might therefore, trusting in the Lord, not 
unreasonably hope to be able to penetrate to the Tartar of the capital and 
the desert.       True it is that his undertaking would not        come 
within the limits of safe and prudent speculation.              But is it 
possible for a plan to come within the limits of safe speculation, which 
has in view the conversion of the Tartar?       Far be it from me to advise
that the entire stock of Testaments be hazarded in such an enterprise; 200 
is the extreme number which should be ventured, the others shipped for 
England, for a seizure upon the agent and his books would be no improbable 
event.       I am a person of few words, and will therefore state without 
circumlocution that I am willing to become that agent.       I speak Russ, 
Mandchou, and the Tartar or broken Turkish of the Russian steppes, and have
also some knowledge of Chinese, which I might easily improve at Kiachta, 
half of the inhabitants of which town are Chinamen.       I am therefore 
not altogether unqualified for such an adventure.       Were the attempt to
be made, the winter of the ensuing year would be the proper time for 
starting, because the book will not be ready before next spring, and the 
expenses of a summer journey would be enormous.
A few days since, upon taking leave of Prince Abbas Khoulgi, who has 
departed from this place to his patrimonial territories, near the Caucasus,
I presented him with a Testament in the Russian-Tartar language, which is 
his native tongue.       He is without one exception the most interesting 
man I have ever met.       Though by religion a Mahometan he is totally 
divested of the blind bigotry which so peculiarly characterises the 
followers of the Camel-driver-warrior-pseudo-prophet, but on the contrary 
is possessed of a mind ever restless in the pursuit of truth, and which 
will doubtless eventually lead him to the narrow path which leadeth unto 
salvation.       The Testament which he received from me was the very last,
in the Tartar language, which remained in the shop at which are sold the 
publications of what was once the Russian Bible Society.       It is a sad 
fact that though there are upwards of three thousand Tartars in St. 
Petersburg, most of whom can read and write the Turkish dialect which they 
speak, not one Testament is at hand suited to their understandings.       I
have formed many acquaintances among these most singular people, whose 
language I have acquired, during my residence in the Russian capital, 
chiefly from conversing with my servant Mahomet Djaffier, a native of 
Bucharia, son of the Iman or Mahometan priest of this place.       
Notwithstanding the superstition and fanaticism of these men I am much 
attached to them; for their conscientiousness, honesty, and fidelity are 
beyond all praise.       They stand in strong contrast with the lower 
orders of the Russians, a good-natured, lowly-vicious, wavering race, 
easily excited, easily soothed; whilst the former are sedate, sober, 
temperate beings, with minds like Egyptian granite, from which it is no 
easy matter to efface an impression, once made.       How lamentable that 
such people should in the all-important matter of religion have embraced 
error instead of truth; what ornaments they would prove at the present day 
to Christianity, if, instead of Mahometanism, Christianity had originally 
come in their way!       Of a surety they would reflect much more lustre on
the religion of Christ than millions whose deeds and behaviour are more 
worthy of the followers of the impostor than of Him        in whose mouth 
was found no craft or subtlety.       
I have much more to write and wish so to do, but I have really no 
time.       It is probable that you will not hear from me again before 
Christmas (old style), but I entreat you to inform me as soon as 
possible whether my proceedings give satisfaction or not; but I must here 
take the liberty of stating that if I were moved one inch from my own 
course, the consequences might prove disastrous to the work, as I should 
instantly lose all power of exertion.       I want no assistance but that 
of God, and will accept of none.       Pray, I beseech you, that 
That be granted.
You would, my dear Sir, be conferring a great favour upon me, if you 
would so far trouble yourself as to write a few lines to my venerated 
friend Mr. Cunningham of Lowestoft, informing him that I am tolerably well,
and that the work is going on most prosperously.
I remain, Reverend and dear Sir,
Your most humble and obliged servant,
George Borrow.
P.S.       Baron Schilling wishes to have a Chinese Testament of the 
large edition: pray, send one if possible, and direct it to me at the 
Sarepta House.       Be particular to remember that it must be of the large
edition, for he has one of the small already in his possession.       He 
wishes likewise to have Gutzlaff and Lindsay       s Voyages.
Enclosed in the letter is the following certificate.

On the other side I send an account of the money disbursed since the 
period of my last writing to you until the present moment.       In respect
to the 75 roubles charged for the reprinting of three sheets of St. 
Matthew, I beg leave to observe, that after several sheets of that Gospel 
had been printed, after the same manner as that adopted in the first 
edition, Mr. Lipoftsoff, the Censor, gave me notice that he had determined 
that the position of the vowel-points should be altered; and I did not 
think proper to make any opposition.       But as common-sense informed me 
that it was by no means expedient to exhibit two systems of pointing in the
same work, I subsequently caused the first sheets to be reprinted.       I 
think it necessary to offer this short explanation to prevent any 
misunderstanding; for this superfluous expense must be attributed to the 
Censor       s not knowing originally his own mind, and not to any 
negligence on my part.       I am so pressed for time that I have not been 
able to refer to my last account, which lies buried amongst the ocean of my
papers, and in stating that I retained in hand 123 roubles, I have merely 
trusted to memory and calculation; but I am sure the Committee and yourself
will excuse my little inaccuracy, when I state my situation.       My two 
compositors, whom I had instructed in all the mysteries of Mandchou 
composition, are in the hospital down with the brain fever, for every kind 
of sickness is at present raging in this place; and during the last three 
days I have been running about in all directions in quest of people to fill
their situation, until they recover.
Thanks be to the Lord, I have discovered and engaged the person who 
composed the first Mandchou Gospel of St. Matthew, ten years since; and as 
next week I shall again station myself in the printing office for the 
purpose of assisting and instructing, the great work will not be delayed, 
and in a fortnight or ten days I trust to be able, provided an opportunity 
occurs, to transmit to England copies of the four Gospels.       With my 
best rewards to Mr. Brandram and Mr. Jowett (whose last letter I have 
received), I remain, etc.,
George Borrow.
To J. Tarn, Esq.
St. Petersburg, 
Feb. 1, 1835.
The last account which I had the honour of transmitting to you detailed 
expenses in the editing of the Mandchou Testament as far as the first two 
sheets of St. John.       That Gospel having by the blessing of the 
Almighty passed through the press, and a copy of it bound, and also copies 
of the three other Gospels, having been forwarded to London, I snatch a 
moment from my occupation to give an account of my late outgoings, the sums
drawn for having been considerable on account of my having many and large 
bills to discharge.       When I last wrote, I retained in hand 75 roubles 
50 copecks, of the sum of 3500 drawn for; since which sum I have drawn for 
the separate sums of 5000 and 500 according to the books of the Sarepta 
House.       I had advanced to the printer in consequence of the illness of
his compositors the sum of 250, which being deducted from the 5000 I shall,
in order to prevent confusion, take no notice of, and proceed to give an 
account of the disbursement of

Should you discover at any time any inaccuracy in the accounts which I 
transmit, you will much oblige me by instantly making me acquainted with 
the same, in order that a satisfactory explanation may be given.       The 
sacrifice of time to the correction of the manuscript and proof-sheets 
scarcely allows me a moment       s leisure, and I am moreover compelled to
superintend the printers and book-binders, for everything goes wrong 
without a strict surveillance.
By the time these lines reach you the Acts of the Apostles (the Lord 
willing) will have passed through the press.       Next week I hope to 
write to the Revd. J. Jowett.
I remain, etc.,
G. Borrow.
P.S.       I believe that the seven shillings may be accounted for in 
this manner.       I charged seven pounds for my passage to Hamburg,
whereas I paid seven guineas.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd.       March 23, 
1835)
St. Petersburg, Febry. 20 [old style], 
1835.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I take advantage of
the period of the Russian Carnival, during which all business is at a 
stand-still, to transmit to you some account of the manner in which I have 
been engaged, since the time when I last addressed myself to you.       
True it is, that I have not much to communicate; for the history of one day
is that of a week, and a month; and when I state that the printing of the 
Mandchou New Testament is advancing rapidly to a conclusion, I shall have 
stated all I can of much importance; but as you and our excellent friends 
at home have a right to demand particulars, I will endeavour to be as 
particular as lies within my power.
About a month since I placed in the hands of Baron Schilling bound 
copies of the first four parts of the Testament, the Gospels; he having 
kindly promised to cause them to be conveyed to London by one of the 
couriers belonging to the Foreign Department, to which the Baron is 
attached.       I have reason to believe, however, that you have not 
received them yet, as I have been informed that they remained in Petersburg
some weeks after they had been deposited in the Foreign Office; but in this
respect I am not culpable; and having no direct means of sending packets to
London, I am glad to embrace any which may come in my way, especially those
not attended with expense to the Society.       In the mean time, I wish to
inform you that I am at present occupied on the last sheets of the fifth 
volume of the Testament, namely, the Acts of the Apostles, in getting which
through the press I have experienced much difficulty, partly from the 
illness of my compositors, and partly from the manner in which the 
translation was originally executed, which has rendered much modification 
highly necessary.
How I have been enabled to maintain terms of friendship and familiarity 
with Mr. Lipoftsoff, and yet fulfil the part which those who employ me 
expect me to fulfil, I am much at a loss to conjecture; and yet such is 
really the case.       It is at all times dangerous to find fault with the 
style and composition of authors and translators, even when they come to 
your door to ask for your advice and assistance.       You may easily 
conceive then, that my situation has been one of treble peril.       Mr. L.
is the Censor of his own work, and against the Censor       s fiat in 
Russia there is no appeal; he is moreover a gentleman whom the slightest 
contradiction never fails to incense to a most incredible degree; and being
a strict member of the Greek Sclavonian Church, imagines that the revealed 
word and will of the Supreme are only to be found in the Sclavonian 
Scriptures, from which he made his Mandchou version.       Yet whenever 
anything has displeased me in his translation, I have frankly told him my 
opinion; and in almost every instance (and the instances have been 
innumerable: for in translations of the sacred writings omissions and 
additions must ever be avoided) he has suffered himself to be persuaded to 
remodel what he originally concluded to be perfect, and which perhaps he 
still does.       So that in what has been hitherto printed of the 
Testament, there is little, if any thing, with which any one but a 
professed caviller can find fault.
I confess that in one instance I have not been able to carry my point; 
though I assure you that I did not yield until I found that it was 
absolutely of no avail to offer any further opposition.       For although 
I was convinced that Mr. L. was wrong, and I think when I state the 
particulars that you will be of my opinion, he had on his side the Chinese 
scholars of St. Petersburg, Baron Schilling amongst the rest, and moreover 
being Censor he could have prohibited the work from proceeding if I had 
been too obstinate.       I will tell you the ground of dispute; for why 
should I conceal it?       Mr. L., amongst what he called his improvements 
of the translation, thought proper, when the Father Almighty is addressed, 
to erase the personal and possessive pronouns thou or thine, 
as often as they occur, and in their stead to make use of the noun as the 
case may require.       For example,        O Father, thou art 
merciful,        he would render,        O Father! the Father is 
merciful       ;        Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy 
name,        by        Our . . . may the name of the Father be made holy, 
may the kingdom of the Father come, may the will of the Father be done on 
earth,        etc.       I of course objected to this, and enquired what 
reason he had for having recourse to so much tautology.       He replied 
that he had the best of reasons; for that amongst the Chinese and Tartars 
none but the dregs of society were ever addressed in the second person; and
that it would be most uncouth and indecent to speak to the Almighty as if 
He were a servant or a slave.       I told him that Christians, when they 
address their Creator, do not address Him as if He were a great gentleman 
or illustrious personage, but rather as children their father, with a 
mixture of reverence and love; and that this mixture of reverence and love 
was one of the most characteristic traits of Christianity.       But he 
said that in China children never address their parent in this manner; and 
that it was contrary to all received usage; and that in speaking to a 
parent the children observe the same respectful formula of phraseology as 
in addressing an Emperor or Viceroy.       I then observed that our object 
in sending the Bible into China was not to encourage the Chinese in any of 
their customs or observances, but rather to wean them from them; and that 
however startling any expression in the Bible might prove to them at first,
it was our hope and trust that it would eventually cease to be disagreeable
and extraordinary, and that the Chinese were at present in a state which 
required stirring and powerful medicine, medicine which must necessarily be
disagreeable to the palate to prove beneficial in another quarter.       
However, he said that I talked        pustota        (emptiness or 
nonsense), and as he was not to be moved, I was compelled to acquiesce with
his dictum.       This occurred some months since, and I rejoice to see in 
the last letter with which you favoured me a fortuitous corroboration of my
views on this subject.       I allude to that part of your letter where you
state that you do not desire the Chinese to consider the Bible the work of 
a Chinese, etc.       Nor do I; and throughout the progress of the work I 
have collated every sheet with the Greek Testament, and whenever I have 
found anything still adhering to the translation which struck me as not 
being faithful to the original, I have invariably modified it, so that, 
with the exception of the one instance above mentioned, I can safely assert
that the Word of God has been rendered into Mandchou as nearly and closely 
as the idiom of a very singular language would permit.
I have now received and paid for, as you will perceive by my accompts, 
495 reams of paper, which will be barely sufficient for the work, which 
will consist of eight parts, instead of seven, as we at first 
supposed.       I take the liberty of requesting that when the books arrive
you will examine the texture of the paper on which they are printed.       
Mr. L. is exceedingly pleased with it, and says that it is superior to the 
paper of the first edition of St. Matthew by at least ten roubles per ream;
and that it is calculated to endure for 200 years.       It certainly does 
possess uncommon strength and consistency, notwithstanding its tenuity, and
the difficulty of tearing it is remarkable.       By my direction it 
received a slight tinge of yellow, as no books are printed in China upon 
paper entirely colourless.       I must be permitted to say that the manner
in which the book-binder, Mr. Lauffert, is performing his task is above all
praise; but he has been accustomed for many years to this kind of work, the
greatest part of Baron Schilling       s immense collection of Chinese 
works having been bound by him.       We may esteem ourselves very 
fortunate in having met with a person so competent to the task, and whose 
terms are so remarkably reasonable.       Any other book-binder in St. 
Petersburg would have refused double the price at which he has executed 
this important part of the work, and had they undertaken the affair, would 
probably have executed it in a manner which would have exposed the book to 
the scorn and laughter of the people for whom it is intended.
A few months since I saw Mr. Glen, the missionary from Astracan, as he 
passed through St. Petersburg on his return to England.       He is a very 
learned man, but of very simple and unassuming manners.       The doom 
which had been pronounced upon his translation seems to have deeply 
affected him; but he appears to me to labour under a very great error 
respecting the motives which induced the Editorial Committee to reject his 
work, or at least to hesitate upon publishing it.       He assured me that 
all that was urged against it was the use, here and there, of Arabic words,
which in a language like the Persian, which on an original foundation 
exhibits a superstructure nearly one moiety of which is Arabic, is 
unavoidable.       As I was totally unacquainted with the facts of the 
case, I said nothing upon the subject; but I now suspect, from a few words 
dropped in your letter, that the objection is founded not on the use of 
Arabic words, but on attempts at improving or adorning the 
simplicity of the Bible.       However this may be, there can be no doubt 
that Mr. Glen is a Persian scholar of the first water.       Mirza Achmed, 
a Persian gentleman now living at St. Petersburg, who resided some time at 
Astracan, informed me that he had seen the translation, and that the 
language was highly elegant; but whether or not the translation was 
faithful, and such as a translation of the sacred volume ought to be, he of
course was entirely ignorant; he could merely speak as to the excellence of
the Persian.       Mirza Djaffar also, the Persian professor here, spoke 
much to the same effect.
Mr. Stallybrass, the Siberian missionary, is at present here on his way 
to England, whither he is conducting his two sons, for the purpose of 
placing them in some establishment, where they may receive a better 
education than it is possible for him to give them in Siberia.       I have
seen him several times, and have heard him preach once at the Sarepta 
House.       He is a clever, well-informed man, and in countenance and 
manner much like Mr. Swan       which similarity may perhaps be accounted 
for by their long residence under the same roof; for people who are in the 
habit of conversing together every day insensibly assume each other       s
habits, manner of speaking, and expression of countenance.       Mr. 
Stallybrass       s youngest son, a lad of fifteen, shows marks of talent 
which may make him useful in the missionary field for which he is 
intended.       The most surprising instance of precocious talent that I 
have ever seen, or ever heard of, is exhibited in a young nobleman, who 
visits me every day.       He is the eldest son of Count Fredro, Marshal of
the Imperial Court, and though only fourteen years of age, speaks eight 
languages perfectly well, is a good Grecian and Latinist, is one of the 
best draftsmen in Russia, is well acquainted with physics, botany, 
geography, and history, and to crown all, has probably the most beautiful 
voice that ever mortal was gifted with.       A admirable Chrishna 
again by metempsychosis; the religion of the family, with whom I am very 
intimate, is the Romish.       I now and then attend the service of the 
Armenian Church, for the purpose of perfecting myself in the language, and 
have formed many acquaintances amongst the congregation: there are several 
very clever and very learned Armenians in this place; one of them I will 
particularly mention, a little elderly gentleman of the name of 
Kudobashoff, who is the best Armenian scholar at present in 
existence.       He is on the eve of publishing a work, calculated to be 
very interesting to us: an Armenian and Russian Dictionary, on which he has
been occupied for the space of thirty-seven years, and which will be of the
highest assistance to any future editor of the Armenian Scriptures; and be 
it known, that no place in Europe, with perhaps the exception of Venice, 
offers more advantages to the editing of the A.S. than St. Petersburg.
I will now conclude, and repeat the assurance that I am ready to attempt
anything which the Society may wish me to execute; and, at a moment       s
warning, will direct my course towards Canton, Pekin, or the court of the 
Grand Lama.       With my best respects to Mr. Brandram, I have the honour 
to remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. Borrow.
To J. Tarn, Esq.
(Endorsed: recd. May, 1835)
St. Petersburg, April 28th [old style], 
1835.
I send you an account of monies spent in the editing of the Acts of the 
Apostles and the first volume of the Epistles.       I beg leave at the 
same time to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Jackson       s letter.       I
am sorry that any mistake should have occurred, but the cause of the one in
question was, that at the time I last wrote to you, I was unable to refer 
to my previous account; however, the mistake now stands rectified.
I take this opportunity of informing you that I shall be obliged to 
order sixty or seventy more reams of paper, as the quantity which I at 
present possess will not be sufficient to complete the work.       You will
see the reason of this in the account which I now send you.       In the 
first volume of the Epistles there are forty-three sheets, and in the 
second there will be nearly the same number; these two volumes in thickness
will be equal to three of the previous parts.       During the last month I
have experienced great difficulty in keeping the printers at work on 
account of the festivals of the season, but I am glad to say that I have 
never failed to obtain six sheets every week.
I have received the Revd. Mr. Jowett       s letter, and shall write to 
him in a few days.
George Borrow.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd. June 1, 1835)
May 3, 1835 [old style], St. 
Petersburg.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I write a few hasty
lines for the purpose of informing you that I shall not be able to obtain a
passport for Siberia, except on the condition that I carry not one single 
Mandchou Bible thither.       The Russian Government is too solicitous to 
maintain a good understanding with that of China to encourage any project 
at which the latter could take umbrage.       Therefore pray inform me to 
what place I am to despatch the Bibles.       I have had some thoughts of 
embarking the first five parts without delay to England, but I have 
forborne from an unwillingness to do anything which I was not commanded to 
do.       By the time I receive your answer everything will be in 
readiness, or nearly so, to be forwarded wherever the Committee shall judge
expedient.       I wish also to receive orders respecting what is to be 
done with the types.       I should be sorry if they were to be abandoned 
in the same manner as before, for it is possible that at some future time 
they may prove eminently useful.
As for myself, I suppose I must return to England, as my task will be 
speedily completed.       I hope the Society are convinced that I have 
served them faithfully, and that I have spared no labour to bring out the 
work, which they did me the honour of confiding to me, correctly and within
as short a time as possible.       At my return, if the Society think that 
I can still prove of utility to them, I shall be most happy to devote 
myself still to their service.       I am a person full of faults and 
weaknesses, as I am every day reminded by bitter experience, but I am 
certain that my zeal and fidelity towards those who put confidence in me 
are not to be shaken.       Should it now become a question what is to be 
done with these Mandchou Bibles which have been printed at a considerable 
expense, I should wish to suggest that Baron Schilling be consulted.       
In a few weeks he will be in London, which he intends visiting during a 
summer tour which he is on the point of commencing.       He will call at 
the Society       s House, and as he is a nobleman of great experience and 
knowledge in all that relates to China, it would not be amiss to 
interrogate him on such a subject.       I again repeat that I am at 
command.
In your last letter but one you stated that our noble President had been
kind enough to declare that I had but to send in an account of any 
extraordinary expenses which I had been put to in the course of the work to
have them defrayed.       I return my most grateful thanks for this most 
considerate intimation, which nevertheless I cannot avail myself of, as 
according to one of the articles of my agreement my salary of        200 
was to cover all extra expenses.       Petersburg is doubtless the dearest 
capital in Europe, and expenses meet an individual, especially one situated
as I have been, at every turn and corner; but an agreement is not to be 
broken on that account.
I have the honour to remain, Revd. and dear Sir, your obedient humble 
servant,
George Borrow.
To J. Thornton, Esq.
(Endorsed: recd. July 20, 1835)
St. Petersburg, June 15, 1835.
Sir,       Having drawn upon Messrs. Asmus, 
Simondsen       Compy. of St. Petersburg for the following sums, I have to 
request that you will honour this draft to a like amount,
1000 roubles (one thousand), received the 11th May.
2000 (two thousand), received at the present moment.
I take the liberty of stating that the printing of the Mandchou 
Testament is brought to a conclusion, and that six of the eight parts are 
bound.       As soon as the other two are completed I shall take my 
departure for England.
I have the honour to remain, Sir,
Your most obedient and most humble servant,
G. Borrow.
To J. Tarn, Esq.
(Endorsed: recd. 17 Aug. 1835)
St. Petersburg, July 16, 1835.
My dear Sir,       I herewith send you a bill
of lading for six of the eight parts of the New Testament which I have at 
last obtained permission to send away, after having paid sixteen visits 
to the House of Interior Affairs.       The seventh part is bound and 
packed up; the eighth is being bound and will be completed in about ten 
days.       It would have been ready a month since, having been nearly six 
weeks in the book-binder       s hands, but he was disappointed in 
obtaining the necessary paper; I hope to have shipped all off, and to have 
bidden adieu to Russia, at the expiration of a fortnight.       I take this
opportunity of informing you that I was obliged to purchase additional 85 
reams of paper, of every sheet of which I shall give an account. 1020 
copies of every sheet I ordered to be printed, that we might have a full 
1000 at the conclusion.       20 reams have at various times been sent to 
the binder for frontings and endings to the work, and there were 36 sheets 
in the seventh and 33 in the eighth part, consequently the demand for paper
is not surprising.       Since my last drafts upon the Treasurer I have 
received two thousand roubles from Asmus, Simondsen and Co., for which I 
shall give them a draft on my departure when I receive my salary.       My 
accompt since the period of my last writing to you, when I held in hand 518
roubles of the Society       s money, I shall deliver to you on my 
arrival.
I have the honour to remain, Dear Sir,
Truly yours,
G. Borrow.
Pray excuse this hasty letter, which I write from the Custom House.

St. Petersburg, Aug. 12, 1835.
As it is probable that yourself and my other excellent and Christian 
friends at the Bible House are hourly expecting me and wondering at my 
non-appearance, I cannot refrain from sending you a few lines in order to 
account for my prolonged stay abroad.       For the last fortnight I have 
been detained at St. Petersburg in the most vexatious and unheard-of 
manner.       The two last parts of our Testaments have been bound and 
ready for shipping a considerable time, and are at present in the warehouse
of a most pious and excellent person in this place, whom the Bible Society 
are well acquainted with; but I have hitherto not been able to obtain 
permission to send them away.       You will ask how I contrived to 
despatch the first six volumes, which you have doubtless by this time 
received.       But I must inform you that at that time I had only a verbal
permission, and that the Custom House permitted them to pass because they 
knew not what they were.       But now, notwithstanding I obtained a 
regular permission to print, and transacted everything in a legal and 
formal manner, I am told that I had no right at all to print the Scriptures
at St. Petersburg, and that my coming thither on that account (I use their 
own words) was a step in the highest degree suspicious and mysterious, and 
that there are even grounds for supposing that I am not connected with the 
Bible Society or employed by them.       To-day, however, I lost patience, 
and said that I would not be trifled with any longer; that next week I 
should send away the books by a vessel which would then sail, and that 
whosoever should attempt to stop them would do so at his peril       and I 
intend to act up to what I said.       I shall then demand my passport and 
advertise my departure, as every one before quitting Russia must be 
advertised in the newspapers two weeks successively.       Pray do me the 
justice to believe that for this unpleasant delay I am by no means 
accountable.       It is in the highest degree tormenting to myself.       
I am very unwell from vexation and disquietude of mind, and am exposed to 
every kind of inconvenience.       The term for which I took my chambers is
expired, and I am living in a dirty and expensive hotel.       But there is
One above who supports me in these troubles, and I have no doubt that 
everything will turn out for the best.
I take this opportunity of sending my accounts to Mr. Tarn; if there be 
any inaccuracy let him excuse it, for the post hurries me.
G. Borrow.
Report of Mr. George Borrow
To the Members of the Committee of the British and Foreign Bible 
Society.
Gentlemen,       It is now about two years 
since I quitted England for St. Petersburg in consequence of the duty which
you have been pleased to confide to my hands, namely, that of editing at 
the Russian capital the New Testament in the Mandchou language which has 
been translated by Mr. Lipoftsoff, at present Councillor of State and 
Chinese Translator at that place, but formerly one of the members of the 
Russian mission at Pekin.       On my arrival, before entering upon this 
highly important and difficult task, I, in obedience to your command, 
assisted Mr. Swan, the missionary from Selinginsk, to complete a transcript
which he had commenced some time previous of a manuscript translation of 
the principal part of the Old Testament into Mandchou executed by Puerot, 
who, originally a Jesuit emissary at Pekin, passed the latter years of his 
life in the service of the Russian mission in the capacity of 
physician.       The united labours of Mr. Swan and myself speedily brought
the task in question to a conclusion, so that the transcript has for a 
considerable time been in the possession of the Bible Society.       I will
here take the liberty of offering a few remarks upon this translation; but 
as the work is not at the present moment before me, it is impossible to 
enter upon a critical and minute examination of its merits.       
Nevertheless, having either transcribed or at various times perused it, I 
have formed a general opinion concerning it which, though very probably a 
faulty one, I shall lay before you in a few words, which at any future time
I hope you will permit me to recall, if fresh lights upon the subject 
compel me to believe that my original conclusion was an erroneous one; 
having no doubt that those who are embarked in so noble a cause as the 
propagation of The Great Truth, will be at all times willing to excuse 
error when confessed, as by the confession of error the truth becomes more 
glaringly manifest.
The merits of this translation are, upon the whole, of a very high 
order; but it would be an untruth and an absurdity to say that it does not 
exhibit defects and blemishes of a striking and peculiar 
kind       peculiar, from the singular fact that those portions of the 
original which, being narrative are exceedingly simple as to idea and 
style, have been invariably rendered in a manner the most liable to 
censure, exhibiting not only a slovenly carelessness in regard to diction, 
but not unfrequently a disregard of accuracy when the slightest particle of
attention was only necessary to render the meaning which the sacred writer 
endeavours to convey.       These are its greatest, and, it may perhaps be 
said, its only defects; for if a regard for truth compel me to state that 
the style of the translation frequently sinks far below the original when 
at its lowest grade, that same regard compels me to say that in yet more 
instances it rises with the same [to a degree] which I believe it is 
scarcely possible for any individual with the limited powers of uninspired 
man to surpass.       This soaring tendency is particularly observable in 
the version of the Book of Job, which is certainly the most beautiful, is 
believed by many to be the most ancient, and is confessedly one of the most
important portions of the Old Testament.       I consider myself in some 
degree entitled to speak particularly of this part of the Mandchou version 
in question, having frequently at the time I was engaged upon it translated
into English several of the chapters which particularly struck me, for the 
purpose of exhibiting them to Mr. Swan, who invariably sympathised with my 
admiration.       The translation of most of the writings of the prophets, 
as far as Puerot went, has been executed in the same masterly manner, and 
it is only to be lamented that, instead of wasting much of his time and 
talents upon the Apocryphal writings, as is unfortunately the case, the 
ex-Jesuit left behind him no Mandchou version of Isaiah and the Psalms, the
lack of which will be sensibly felt whenever his work shall be put in a 
printed state into the hands of those for whose benefit it is intended, an 
event most devoutly to be wished for by all those who would fain see Christ
reign triumphant in that most extraordinary country of which the Mandchou 
constitutes one of the principal languages, being used in diplomacy and at 
court, and being particularly remarkable for possessing within it 
translations of all the masterpieces of Chinese, Tibetian, and Brahmanic 
literature with which it has been enriched since the period of the 
accession of the present Tartar dynasty to the Chinese throne, the proper 
language of which dynasty it is well known to be.
To translate literally, or even closely, according to the common 
acceptation of the term, into the Mandchou language is of all 
impossibilities the greatest; partly from the grammatical structure of the 
language, and partly from the abundance of its idioms.       The Mandchou 
is the only one of any of the civilised languages of the world with which 
the writer of these lines has any acquaintance, whose grammar stands far 
aloof from the rest in wonderful singularity; the most remarkable feature 
of which is the want of some of those conjunctions generally considered as 
indispensable, and which are certainly of the first utility.       The 
result of this peculiarity is that such a combination of other parts of 
speech must be employed as will express the idea without the aid of the 
conjunction; but as these combinations are invariably and necessarily 
lengthy, much more space is required in the translation of a sentence into 
this language than the original occupies.       I am induced to make this 
remark, which I am afraid will be considered an excursory one, from the 
apprehensiveness that some, observing the translations of the Scriptures 
into this language to be bulkier than the originals, might conclude that 
extraneous and unnecessary matter had crept in, which a knowledge of the 
above fact will prevent.
The transcript of the Mandchou Old Testament having been brought to a 
conclusion and permission having been obtained to print the New at St. 
Petersburg       the accomplishment of which last point was, as you are 
well aware, attended with much difficulty       I set myself seriously to 
work upon the principal object of my mission.       With the recapitulation
of my labours I wish not to trouble you, the various particulars having 
been communicated to you in letters written at various times upon the 
subject.       I will content myself with observing that within ten months 
from the commencement of printing, the entire work, consisting of eight 
volumes, had with the blessing of the Almighty passed through the press, 
and, I believe, with as few typographical errors as would have been the 
case had a much more considerable portion of time been devoted to the 
enterprise, which, it is true, I was in haste to accomplish, but in a 
manner not calculated to render the undertaking futile nor cast discredit 
upon the Society and myself [being well aware that an edition of the 
Scriptures exhibiting marks of carelessness must at best be a futile work, 
and that the speed with which it was executed could be no apology; as few 
will be tempted to deny that no edition at all of the sacred volume in the 
languages of the heathen is far preferable to one whose incorrectness would
infallibly and with some reason awaken ridicule, which, though one of the 
most contemptible, is certainly one of the most efficacious weapons in the 
armoury of the Prince of Darkness and the Enemy of Light, as it is well 
known that his soldiers here on earth accomplish by its means what they 
would never be able to effect by the utmost force of eloquence and carnal 
reasoning, in the use and management of which they are, however, by no 
means unskilled, as many a follower of Jesus from his own individual 
experience can testify].
After the termination of my editorial task, having little to employ 
myself upon whilst the two last volumes were undergoing the process of 
binding, I determined upon a journey to Moscow, the ancient capital of the 
Russian Empire, which differs widely from St. Petersburg in appearance, 
structure, and in the manners, habits, and opinions of its 
inhabitants.       I arrived there after a journey of four days.       
Moscow is by far the most remarkable city it has ever been my fortune to 
see; but as it has been frequently described, and with tolerable 
correctness, there is no necessity for me to enter into a particular 
account of all that presented itself to my observation.       I ascended 
the celebrated tower of Ivan Velik        , situated within the walls of 
the Kremlin, from the top of which there is a glorious view of Moscow and 
of the surrounding country, and at the foot of which, in a deep hole in the
earth, is the gigantic bell which weighs 27,000 poods, or eight 
hundred and seventy thousand pounds.       I likewise visited the splendid 
church of the Kremlin, and had much conversation with the priest who is in 
the habit of showing its curiosities to strangers.       He is a most 
intelligent and seemingly truly pious person, and well acquainted with 
English spiritual literature, especially with the writings of Bishops 
Taylor and Tillotson, whom he professed to hold in great admiration; though
he asserted that both these divines, great men as they undoubtedly were, 
were far inferior writers to his own celebrated countryman Archbishop 
Teekon, and their productions less replete with spiritual 
manna       against which assertion I felt little inclined to urge any 
objection, having myself perused the works of the great Russian divine with
much comfort and satisfaction, and with which I can only regret [that] the 
devout part of the British public are up to the present moment utterly 
unacquainted.
As one of the principal motives of my visit to Moscow was to hold 
communication with a particular part of its population, which from the 
accounts I had received of it had inspired me with the most vivid interest,
I did not fail shortly after my arrival to seek an opportunity of 
accomplishing my work, and believe that what I have now to communicate will
be of some interest to the Christian and the philosopher.       I allude to
the people called Zigani or Gypsies, or, as they style themselves, Rommany,
of which there are several thousands in and about Moscow, and who obtain a 
livelihood by various means.       Those who have been accustomed to 
consider these people as wandering barbarians, incapable of civilisation 
and unable to appreciate the blessings of a quiet and settled life, will be
surprised at learning that many of those in Moscow inhabit large and 
handsome houses, appear abroad in elegant equipages, and if distinguishable
from the genteel class of the Russians [are] only so by superior personal 
advantages and mental accomplishments.       Of this singular phenomenon at
Moscow the female Gypsies are the principal cause, having from time 
immemorial cultivated their vocal powers to such an extent that, although 
in the heart of a country in which the vocal art has arrived at greater 
perfection than in any other part of the world, the principal Gypsy choirs 
in Moscow are allowed by the general voice of the public to be unrivalled 
and to bear away the palm from all competitors.       It is a fact 
notorious in Russia that the celebrated Catalani was so filled with 
admiration for the powers of voice displayed by one of the Gypsy songsters,
who, after the former had sung before a splendid audience at Moscow, 
stepped forward and with an astonishing burst of melody ravished every ear,
that she tore from her own shoulders a shawl of immense value which had 
been presented to her by the Pope, and embracing the Gypsy compelled her to
accept it, saying that it had been originally intended for the matchless 
singer which she now discovered was not herself.       The sums obtained by
these performers are very large, enabling them to live in luxury of every 
description and to maintain their husbands in a princely way.       Many of
them are married to Russian gentlemen; and every one who has resided for 
any length of time in Russia cannot but be aware that the lovely, talented,
and domesticated wife of Count Alexander Tolstoi is by birth a Gypsy, and 
was formerly one of the ornaments of a Rommany choir at Moscow as she is 
now one of the principal ornaments of the marriage state and of illustrious
life.       It is not, however, to be supposed that all the female Gypsies 
in Moscow are of this high, talented, and respectable order; amongst them 
there are a great number of low, vulgar, and profligate females who sing in
taverns, or at the various gardens in the neighbourhood, and whose husbands
and male connections subsist by horse-jobbing and such kinds of low 
traffic.       The principal place of resort of this class is Marina 
Rotche, lying about two verses from Moscow, and thither I drove, 
attended by a valet-de-place.       Upon my arriving there the 
Gypsies swarmed out from their tents and from the little tracteer or
tavern, and surrounded me.       Standing on the seat of the 
cal        che, I addressed them in a loud voice in the dialect of 
the English Gypsies, with which I have some slight acquaintance.       A 
scream of wonder instantly arose, and welcomes and greetings were poured 
forth in torrents of musical Rommany, amongst which, however, the most 
pronounced cry was: ah kak mi toute karmuma              Oh, how we 
love you,        for at first they supposed me to be one of their brothers,
who, they said, were wandering about in Turkey, China, and other parts, and
that I had come over the great pawnee, or water, to visit 
them.       Their countenances exactly resembled those of their race in 
England and Spain, brown, and for the most part beautiful, their eyes fiery
and wildly intelligent, their hair coal-black and somewhat coarse.       I 
asked them numerous questions, especially as to their religion and original
country.       They said that they believed in        Devil,        which, 
singularly enough, in their language signifies God, and that they were 
afraid of the evil spirit, or        Bengel       ; that their fathers came
from Rommany land, but where that land lay they knew not.       They sang 
many songs both in the Russian and Rommany languages; the former were 
modern popular pieces which are in vogue on the stage, but the latter were 
evidently very ancient, being composed in a metre or cadence to which there
is nothing analogous in Russian prosody, and exhibiting an internal 
character which was anything but European or modern.       I visited this 
place several times during my sojourn at Moscow, and spoke to them upon 
their sinful manner of living, upon the advent and suffering of Christ 
Jesus, and expressed, upon my taking a final leave of them, a hope that 
they would be in a short period furnished with the word of eternal life in 
their own language, which they seemed to value and esteem much higher than 
the Russian.       They invariably listened with much attention; and during
the whole time I was amongst them exhibited little in speech or conduct 
which was objectionable.
I returned to Petersburg, and shortly afterwards, the business which had
brought me to Russia being successfully terminated, I quitted that country,
and am compelled to acknowledge, with regret.       I went thither 
prejudiced against the country, the government, and the people; the first 
is much more agreeable than is generally supposed; the second is seemingly 
the best adapted for so vast an empire; and the third, even the lowest 
classes, are in general kind, hospitable, and benevolent.       True it is 
that they have many vices, and their minds are overshadowed by the gloomy 
clouds of Grecian superstition, but the efforts of many excellent and pious
persons amongst the English at St. Petersburg are directed to unveiling to 
them the cheering splendour of the lamp of the Gospel; and it is the 
sincere prayer of the humble individual who now addresses you that the 
difficulties which at present much obstruct their efforts may be speedily 
removed, and that from the boundless champains of Russia may soon resound 
the Jubilee hymn of millions, who having long groped their way in the 
darkness of the shadow of death, are at once blessed with light, and with 
joyful hearts acknowledge the immensity of the blessing.

Revd. and dear Sir,       Pray excuse the 
liberty I take in troubling you with these lines, which I write for the 
purpose of informing you that I am perfectly ready to undertake anything 
which yourself or Mr. Brandram may deem expedient.       I should be most 
happy to explore Portugal and Spain, and to report upon the possibility of 
introducing the Gospel into those countries, provided that plan has not 
been given up; or to commence the Armenian Testament forthwith, if the 
types are ready.       If you would so far condescend as to return an 
answer as soon as it suits your convenience, you would confer no slight 
obligation upon me, for I am weary of doing nothing, and am sighing for 
employment.
I have the honour to remain, Revd. and Dear Sir, your most obliged and 
most obedient servant,

Revd. and dear Sir,       I have received 
your letter of the 26th, as I suppose Mr. Jowett has received mine of the 
same date which I needlessly sent.       As you ask me to favour you with 
my thoughts, I certainly will; for I have thought much upon the matters in 
question, and the result I will communicate to you in a very few 
words.       I decidedly approve (and so do all the religious friends whom 
I have communicated it to) of the plan of a journey to Portugal, and am 
sorry that it has been suspended, though I am convinced that your own 
benevolent and excellent heart was the cause, unwilling to fling me into an
undertaking which you supposed might be attended with peril and 
difficulty.       Therefore I wish it to be clearly understood that I am 
perfectly willing to undertake the expedition, nay, to extend it into 
Spain, to visit the town and country, to discourse with the people, 
especially those connected with institutions for infantine education, and 
to learn what ways and opportunities present themselves for conveying the 
Gospel into those benighted countries.       I will moreover undertake, 
with the blessing of God, to draw up a small volume of what I shall have 
seen and heard there which cannot fail to be interesting, and if patronised
by the Society will probably help to cover the expenses of the 
expedition.
On my return I can commence the Armenian Testament, and whilst I am 
editing that, I may be acquiring much vulgar Chinese from some unemployed 
Lascar or stray Cantonman whom I may pick up upon the wharves; and 
then       to China.       I have no more to say, for were I to pen twenty 
pages, and I have time enough for so doing, I could communicate nothing 
which would make my views more clear.       Many thanks to you for 
enclosing the letter from St. Petersburg: it was written in Danish, and 
came from a very dear and excellent friend who rendered me in Russia 
services of no common nature.
I have the honour to be, Revd. and Dear Sir, your most obedient 
servant,
George Borrow.
P.S.       There has been a Bible meeting at Oulton in Suffolk, to which
I was invited.       The speaking produced such an effect that some of the 
most vicious characters in the neighbourhood have become weekly subscribers
to the Branch Society.       So says the Chronicle of Norfolk in its
report.
To the Rev. J. Jowett
(Endorsed: recd. Dec. 8, 1835)
Lisbon, 30 Nov. 1835.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I arrived safe at 
Lisbon on the twelfth of the present month after a passage which, 
considering the season in which it was made, may be termed a fair 
one.       On the morning of the tenth we found ourselves about two leagues
from the coast of Galicia, whose lofty mountains gilded by the rising sun 
presented a magnificent appearance.       We soon passed Cape Finisterre, 
and standing farther out to sea speedily lost sight of land.       On the 
morning of the eleventh the sea was very rough, and a most remarkable 
circumstance occurred.       I was on the forecastle, discoursing with two 
of the sailors, [and] one of them who had just left his hammock told me 
that he had had a most disagreeable dream, for, said he, pointing up to the
mast,        I dreamt that I fell into the sea from off the 
cross-trees.              He was heard to say this by several of the crew 
besides myself.       A moment after, the captain of the vessel, perceiving
that the squall was increasing, ordered the topsails to be taken in, 
whereupon this man with several others instantly ran up aloft.       The 
yard was presently loosened, and in the act of being hauled down, when a 
violent gust of wind whirled it round with violence, and a man was struck 
down from the cross-trees into the sea, which was raging and tumbling 
below.       In a few moments he emerged, and I saw his head distinctly on 
the crest of a wave, and I recognised in the unfortunate man the sailor who
shortly before had been relating his dream.       I shall never forget the 
look of agony he cast us whilst the ship hurried past him.       The alarm 
was given, and in a moment everything was in confusion.       It was at 
least two minutes before the vessel was stopped, and the man was left a 
considerable way behind, but I still kept my eye upon him, and could 
perceive that he was struggling gallantly with the waves.       A boat was 
at length lowered, but the rudder unfortunately was not at hand, and only 
two oars could be procured, with which the men who manned her could make 
but little progress in the tremendous sea; however, they did their best, 
and had arrived within ten yards of the man who had continued struggling 
for his life, when I lost sight of him, and the men on their return said 
that they saw him below the waters at glimpses, sinking deeper and deeper, 
his arms stretched out and his body to all appearance stiff, but they found
it impossible to save him.       Presently afterwards the sea, as if 
satisfied with the prey it had received, became comparatively calm, and the
squall subsided.       The poor fellow who was drowned in this singular 
manner was a fine young man, twenty-seven years of age, the only son of a 
widowed mother.       He was the best sailor on board, and beloved by every
one who was acquainted with him.       The event occurred on the 11th of 
November 1835, the vessel was the        London Merchant        Steamship, 
commanded by Captain Whittingham.       Wonderful indeed are the ways of 
Providence.
I experienced some difficulty in landing at Lisbon, the custom-house 
officers being exceedingly dilatory in examining the baggage.       I had 
yet more difficulty in obtaining a lodging, but at last found one, dark, 
dirty, and exceedingly expensive, without attendance.       I shall not 
trouble you with a description of Lisbon, for as I have much that is 
important to communicate I must not waste paper with uninteresting 
details.       I will merely observe that it is a noble town, situated on 
seven hills on the left bank of the Tagus, the houses are very lofty, like 
castles, the streets are in general precipitously steep, and no animals of 
burden but mules, asses, and oxen can traverse them with safety.       I 
found the streets by no means so dirty as they have been represented, and 
at night they are tolerably well lighted, but between the hours of nine and
twelve they swarm with robbers and assassins.
I should have written to you before, but I wished to transmit in my 
first letter a stock of information which would enable you at once to form 
some idea as to the state of this country; and in order to acquire such I 
have visited every part of Lisbon, entered into discourse with the people 
on all occasions, and have made a journey of nearly one hundred miles about
the country, during which I visited Cintra and Mafra, at the former of 
which places I remained four days, making excursions in the meanwhile on 
foot or on a mule amongst the mountains, and visiting whatever villages are
contained within its beautiful and picturesque neighbourhood.
In Lisbon carelessness for religion of any kind seems to prevail.       
The people appear in general to have shaken off the old superstition and to
feel no inclination to bend their necks to another yoke.       Many of them
have told me that the priests are the veriest knaves in the world, and that
they have for many years subsisted by imposing upon them, and that they 
wished the whole body was destroyed from the face of the earth.       I 
have enquired of many of the lower orders whether they ever confessed 
themselves, whereupon they laughed in my face and said that they had not 
done so for years, demanding what good would result to them for so doing, 
and whether I was fool enough to suppose that a priest could forgive sins 
for a sum of money.       One day whilst speaking to a muleteer I pointed 
to a cross over the gate of a chapel opposite to us, and asked him if he 
reverenced it; he instantly flew into a rage, stamped violently, and 
spitting on the ground said it was a piece of stone, and that he should 
have no more objection to spit upon it than the stones on which he trod: 
       I believe that there is a God,        he added,        but as for 
the nonsense which the priests tell us I believe no part of 
it.              It has not yet been my fortune during my researches in 
Lisbon to meet one individual of the populace amongst the many I have 
addressed who had read the Scripture or knew anything of its contents; 
though many of them have assured me that they could read, which in many 
instances I have found to be the fact, having repeatedly taken from my 
pocket the New Testament in Portuguese which I constantly carry with me, 
and requested them to read a few verses, which they were able to do.       
Some of these individuals had read much in their own language, which indeed
contains a store of amusing and instructive literature       for example, 
the chronicles of the various kings of Portugal and of the heroes who 
distinguished themselves in the various wars of India, after Vasco da Gama 
had opened the way into the vast regions of the East by doubling the 
Cape.
Amongst the many public places which I have visited at Lisbon is the 
Convent of San Geronymo, the church of which is the most beautiful specimen
of Gothic architecture in the Peninsula, and is furnished with the richest 
shrines.       Since the expulsion of the monks from the various religious 
houses in Portugal, this edifice has served as an asylum for orphans, and 
at present enjoys the particular patronage of the young [Queen].       In 
this establishment upwards of five hundred children, some of them female, 
are educated upon the Lancastrian system, and when they have obtained a 
sufficient age are put out to the various trades and professions for which 
they are deemed most suited, the tallest and finest of the lads being 
drafted into the army.       One of the boys of his own accord became my 
guide and introduced me to the various classes, where I found the children 
clean and neat and actively employed upon their tasks.       I asked him if
the Holy Scripture (Santa Escritura) was placed in the hands of the 
scholars.       He answered in the affirmative; but I much doubt the 
correctness of his answer, for upon my requesting him to show me a copy of 
the Holy Scripture, he did not appear to know what I meant by it.       
When he said that the scholars read the Holy Scripture he probably meant 
the vile papistical book called        Christian Doctrine,        in which 
the office of the mass is expounded, which indeed I saw in the hands of the
junior boys, and which, from what I have since seen, I believe to be a 
standard school-book in Portugal.       I spent nearly two hours in 
examining the various parts of this institution, and it is my intention to 
revisit it in a short time, when I hope to obtain far better information as
to the moral and religious education of its inmates.
On my arrival at Lisbon I was disappointed in my expectation of finding 
Mr. Wilby, who was in the country and was not expected for a week.       I 
therefore had at first no person to whom I could apply for counsel as to 
the best means of proceeding; but unwilling to remain idle till the period 
of his arrival, I at once commenced operations at Lisbon as I have 
narrated.       At the end of four or five days I started for Cintra, 
distant about four leagues from Lisbon, situate on a ledge of the northern 
declivity of a wild and picturesque mountain.       Cintra contains about 
eight hundred inhabitants, and in its environs are many magnificent 
quintas or country seats of some of the first families in Portugal; 
it is likewise a royal residence, for at its north-eastern side stands an 
ancient palace, which though unfurnished is preserved in [good repair], and
which was the favourite residence of the ancient kings.       On one of the
ridges of [this] mountain are seen the ruins of an immense castle, which 
for centuries was the stronghold of the Moors in this part of the 
Peninsula.       The morning after my arrival I was about to ascend the 
mountain to examine it, when I observed a person, advanced in years, whom, 
by his dress, I judged to be an ecclesiastic; upon enquiry I found in 
effect that he was one of the three priests of the place.       I instantly
accosted him, and had no reason to repent for so doing, for I found him 
affable and communicative.       After praising the beauty of the scenery, 
I made some enquiry as to the state of education amongst the people beneath
his care.       He told me that he was sorry to [say that] they were in a 
state of great ignorance, that very few of them could either write or 
[read], that there was no school in the place but one at which a few 
children were taught the alphabet, but which was not then open, that there 
was a school at Colhares, about a league [distant].       He said that 
nothing so surprised him as to see English, the most learned and 
intelligent people in the world, visiting a place like Cintra, where there 
was no literature and nothing of utility (aonde no ha nem leitura, 
nem sciencia, nem alguma cousa que presta).       You may 
easily guess that I was in no slight degree surprised to hear a priest of 
Portugal lament the ignorance of the populace, and began to entertain hopes
that I should not find the priests in general so indisposed to the mental 
improvement of the people as I at first imagined.
That same day I visited Colhares, a romantic village lower down the 
mountain to the west, near the sea.       Seeing some peasants collected 
round the smithy I enquired about the school, and one instantly offered to 
be my guide thither.       I went upstairs into a small apartment where I 
found the master with about a dozen pupils standing in a row, for there was
but one chair, or rather stool, to which, after having embraced me, he 
conducted me with great civility.       After some discourse he shewed me 
the books which he used for the instruction of his pupils; they were 
spelling-books like those used in our village schools and the 
before-mentioned        Christian Doctrine.              Upon my enquiring 
whether it was his custom to use the Scripture in his school, he told me 
that long before the children had acquired sufficient intelligence to 
understand the Scriptures their parents took them from school in order that
they might assist them in the labours of the field, and that in general 
they were by no means solicitous that their children should learn anything,
as they considered the time occupied in acquiring learning as squandered 
away.       He added that all the village schools in Portugal were 
supported by the Government, but that many of them had lately been 
discontinued, as the schoolmasters experienced the greatest difficulty in 
obtaining their salaries; but that he had heard that it was the intention 
of the Government to establish schools in all parts of the country on the 
Lancastrian system       which since my return to Lisbon I have discovered 
to be a fact.       He told me that he had a copy of the New Testament in 
his possession, which I desired to see; but on examining it I discovered 
that it was only the Epistles (from Pereira       s version) with long 
Popish notes.       I asked him whether he considered that there was any 
harm in reading the Scripture without notes; he said that there was 
certainly no harm in it, but that simple people without the assistance of 
notes could derive but little benefit therefrom, as the greatest part that 
they read would be unintelligible to them.       Whereupon I shook hands 
with him, and on departing said that there was no part of Scripture so 
difficult to understand as those very notes which were intended to 
elucidate it, and that the Almighty would never have inspired His saints 
with a desire to write what was unintelligible to the great mass of 
mankind.
For some days after this I traversed the country in all directions, 
riding into the fields where I saw the peasants at work, and entering into 
discourse with them; and notwithstanding many of my questions must have 
appeared to them very singular, I never experienced any incivility, though 
they frequently answered me with smiles and laughter.       (I have now 
communicated about half of what I have to say; the remainder next week.

Evora in the Alemtejo, 15th Dec., 
1835.
At length I departed for Mafra; the principal part of the way lay over 
steep and savage hills, very dangerous for horses, and I had reason to 
repent, before I got back to Cintra, that I had not mounted one of the 
sure-footed mules of the country.       I reached Mafra in safety; it is a 
large village, which has by degrees sprung up in the vicinity of an immense
building, originally intended to serve as a convent and palace, and which 
next to the Escurial is the most magnificent edifice in the 
Peninsula.       In this building is to be seen the finest library in 
Portugal, comprising books in all sciences and languages, and which, if not
suited to the place in which the building stands, which is almost a desert,
is yet well suited to the size and grandeur of the building which contains 
it.       But here are now no monks to take care of it; they have been 
driven forth, some of them to beg their bread, some of them to serve under 
the banners of Don Carlos in Spain, and many, as I have been informed, to 
prowl about as banditti.       The place is now abandoned to two or three 
menials, and exhibits an aspect of solitude and desolation which is truly 
appalling.       Whilst I was viewing the cloisters an exceedingly fine and
intelligent-looking lad came up to me, and asked (I suppose in the hope of 
obtaining a trifle) if I would permit him to show me the village church, 
which he told me was well worth seeing.       I said        No,        but 
that if he would show me the village school, I should be much obliged to 
him.       He looked at me with astonishment, and assured me that there was
nothing to be seen in the school, at which not more than half a dozen boys 
were instructed, and that he himself was one of the number; but I told him 
that he should show me no other place, and he at last unwillingly attended 
me.       On the way he said that the schoolmaster was one of the brothers 
of the convent who had lately been expelled, and that he was a very learned
man and spoke French and Greek.       We went past a stone cross, and the 
boy bent and crossed himself with much devotion: I mention this 
circumstance, as it was the first instance of devotion which I had observed
amongst the Portuguese since my arrival.       When near the house where 
the schoolmaster resided, he pointed it out to me and then hid himself 
behind a wall, where he waited till I returned.
On stepping over the threshold I was confronted by a short stout man, 
between sixty and seventy years of age, dressed in a blue jerkin and grey 
trousers, without shirt or waistcoat.       He looked at me sternly, and 
enquired in the French language what was my pleasure.       I apologised 
for intruding upon him, and stated that, being informed that he occupied 
the situation of schoolmaster to the place, I had come to pay my respects 
to him, and to beg to be informed respecting the manner of instruction 
which he adopted.       He said that whosoever told me that he was a 
schoolmaster lied, for that he was a brother of the convent.       I 
replied that I had heard that all the friaries had been broken up and the 
brothers dismissed; whereupon he sighed, and said it was too true.       He
was then silent for a minute, and his better nature overcoming his angry 
feelings he produced a snuff-box and offered it to me.       The snuff-box 
is the olive-branch of the Portuguese, and he who wishes to be on good 
terms with them, or to conciliate them, must never refuse to put his finger
and thumb into it when preferred; I took therefore a large pinch, though I 
detest the dust, and we were soon friendly enough.       He was eager to 
obtain news, especially from Lisbon and Spain.       I told him that the 
officers of the regiments at Lisbon had the day before I left that place 
gone in a body to the Queen, and insisted upon her either receiving their 
swords or dismissing her Ministers; whereupon he rubbed his hands and said,
       I am sure that things will not remain tranquil at 
Lisbon.              Upon my saying that the affairs of Don Carlos were on 
the decline, he frowned, and said that it could not possibly be, for that 
God was too just to suffer it.       I felt for the poor man, who had been 
driven from his home in the noble convent close by, and from a state of 
comfort and affluence reduced in his old age to indigence and misery, for 
his dwelling seemed to contain scarcely an article of furniture.       I 
tried twice or thrice to induce him to converse on the school, but he 
always avoided the subject or said shortly that he knew nothing about it; 
the idea of being a schoolmaster was evidently humiliating to him.
On my leaving him, the boy came from his hiding-place and rejoined me; 
he said his reason for hiding himself was fear that his master might know 
that it was he who brought me to him, for that the old man was ashamed of 
appearing in the character of a schoolmaster.       I asked the boy whether
he or his parents were acquainted with the Scripture and ever read it; but 
he did not understand me.       I must here observe that the boy was 
fifteen years of age, and that he was in many respects very intelligent and
had some knowledge of the Latin language; nevertheless he knew not the 
Scripture even by name, and I have no doubt that at least one half of his 
countrymen are, in that respect, no wiser than himself.       I have 
questioned the children of Portugal at the doors of village inns, at the 
hearths of their cottages, in the fields where they labour, at the stone 
Mountains by the way-sides where they water their cattle, about the 
Scripture, the Bible, the Old and New Testament, and in scarcely one 
instance have they known what I was alluding to or could return me a 
rational answer, though in all other instances I had no reason to complain 
of their want of apprehension.       Indeed nothing has surprised me more 
than the free and unembarrassed manner with which the Portuguese peasantry 
sustain a conversation, and the purity of the language in which they 
express their thoughts; and yet very few of them can write or read, whereas
the peasantry of our own country, whose education is in general much 
superior, are in their conversation coarse and dull almost to brutality, 
and absurdly ungrammatical in the language which they use, though the 
English tongue, upon the whole, is more simple in its grammar than the 
Portuguese.
On my way back from Mafra to Cintra I very nearly lost my life.       As
the night was closing in fast, we left the regular road by the advice of 
the guide, and descending the hill on which Mafra stands reached the bottom
of the valley, from which there is a narrow pathway winding round the next 
hill, exceedingly steep, with a precipice on the left side; the horse on 
which I was mounted, and which was by no means suited for such climbing, in
his violent struggles to accomplish the ascent burst the girth of the 
saddle, so that I was cast violently off, with the saddle beneath me.      
Fortunately, I fell on the right side, or I should have rolled down the 
hill and probably have been killed; as it was, I remained stunned and 
senseless for two or three minutes, when I revived, and with the assistance
of the guide and the man who waits on me, walked up the remaining part of 
the hill, when, the saddle being readjusted, I mounted again.       I was 
very drowsy and stupid for two or three days, from the influence of the 
fall, but I am happy to say at present, thanks to the Almighty, I have long
ceased to feel any inconvenience from it.
On my return to Lisbon I saw Mr. Wilby, who received me with great 
kindness; the next ten days were exceedingly rainy and prevented me from 
making any excursions into the country, and during this time I saw him 
frequently and had a good deal of conversation with him, concerning the 
best means of causing God       s glorious Gospel to be read in 
Portugal.       He informed me that four hundred copies of the Bible and 
New Testament were arrived, and he thought that we could do no better than 
put them into the hands of the booksellers; but I strongly advised that at 
least half of them should be entrusted to colporteurs, to hawk about, upon 
receiving a certain profit on every copy they sold.       He thought the 
idea a good one, as far as regards Lisbon, but said that no colporteur 
would venture to carry them about the country, as the fanatical priests 
would probably cause him to be assassinated.       He was kind enough to 
promise to look out for people suited to make the essay in the streets of 
Lisbon; and as the lower orders are very poor I wrote to Mr. Whiteley at 
Oporto, requesting to be informed whether he had any objection to our 
selling the books to the populace at Lisbon at a lower price than a 
cruzado novo, which he had determined to sell them at.       I 
thought it but right to consult him on the subject, as the Society are 
under great obligations to him; and I was unwilling to do anything at which
he could possibly take umbrage.       During one of my conversations with 
Mr. Wilby I enquired which was the province of Portugal, the population of 
which he considered to be the most ignorant and benighted: he replied, 
       The Alemtejo.              The Alemtejo means        the other side 
of the Tagus.              This province is not beautiful and picturesque 
like the other portions of Portugal, it has few hills or mountains; the 
greatest part of it consists of heaths, broken by knolls and gloomy 
dingles, swamps, and forests of stunted pine.       These places are 
infested with banditti, and not a week passes by without horrible murders 
and desperate robberies occurring.       The principal town is Evora, one 
of the most ancient cities in Portugal, and formerly the seat of an 
Inquisition far more cruel and baneful than the terrible one of 
Lisbon.       Evora lies about sixty miles from the farther bank of the 
Tagus, which is at Lisbon three leagues broad; and to Evora I determined on
going with a small cargo of Testaments and Bibles.       My reasons I need 
not state, as they must be manifest to every Christian; but I cannot help 
thinking that it was the Lord who inspired me with the idea of going 
thither, as by so doing I have introduced the Scriptures into the worst 
part of the Peninsula, and have acquired lights and formed connections 
(some of the latter most singular ones, I admit) which if turned to proper 
account will wonderfully assist us in our object of making the heathen of 
Portugal and Spain acquainted with God       s holy word.       My journey 
to Evora and my success there shall be detailed in my next letter.

JOURNEY TO EVORA
An Extract from My Journal
On the afternoon of the sixth of December I set out for this place, 
accompanied by my servant Anthonio.       I had been informed that the tide
would serve for the felouks, or passage-boats, employed in crossing 
the Tagus, at about four o       clock, but on reaching the river       s 
side opposite Aldea Gallega, between which place and Lisbon they ply, I 
found that the tide would not permit them to start before eight 
o       clock.       Had I waited for them I should probably have landed at
Aldea Gallega at midnight, and I felt little inclination to make my 
entr        e in the Alemtejo at that hour; therefore as I saw small
boats which can push off at any time lying near in abundance, I determined 
upon hiring one of them for the passage, though the expense would be thus 
considerably increased.       I soon agreed with a wild-looking lad to take
us over, who told me that he was in part owner of one of the boats.       I
was not aware of the danger in crossing the Tagus at any time in these 
small boats at its broadest part, which is between Lisbon and Aldea 
Gallega, but especially at close of day in the winter season, or I should 
certainly not have ventured.       The lad and his comrade, a miserable 
object, whose only clothing, notwithstanding the severity of the weather, 
was a battered jerkin and trousers, rowed until we had advanced about half 
a mile from the land; they then hoisted a large sail, and the lad, who 
seemed to be the principal and to direct everything, took the helm and 
steered.       The evening was now setting in; the sun was not far from its
bourne in the horizon, the air was very cold, the wind was rising, and the 
waves of the noble Tagus began to be crested with foam.       I told the 
boy that it was scarcely possible for the boat to carry so much sail 
without upsetting; upon which he laughed, and began to gabble in a most 
incoherent manner.       He had the most harsh and rapid articulation that 
has ever come under my observation; it was the scream of the hyena blended 
with the bark of the terrier; but it was by no means an index of his 
disposition, which I soon found to be light, merry, and anything but 
malevolent; for when I, in order to show him that I cared little about him,
began to hum:        Eu que sou contrabandista        (       I, who
am a smuggler       ), he laughed heartily, and clapping me on the shoulder
said that he would not drown us if he could help it.       The other poor 
fellow seemed by no means averse to go to the bottom; he sat at the 
forepart of the boat looking the image of famine, and only smiled when the 
waters broke over the side and drenched his scanty clothing.       In a 
little time I had made up my mind that our last hour was come; the wind was
becoming higher, the short dangerous waves were more foamy, the boat was 
frequently on its beam-ends, and the water came over the lee side in 
torrents; but still the wild lad at the helm held on, laughing and 
chattering, and occasionally yelling out parts of the Miguelite air 
       Quando el Rey chegou        [       When the King 
arrived       ], the singing of which in Lisbon is punished with 
imprisonment.       The stream was against us, but the wind was in our 
favour, and we sprang along at a wonderful rate.       I saw that our only 
chance of escape was in speedily getting under the shelter of that part of 
the farther bank of the Tagus, where the bight or bay commences at the 
extremity of which stands Aldea Gallega, as we should not then have to 
battle with the waves of the adverse stream, which the wind lashed into 
fury.       It was the will of the Almighty to permit us speedily to gain 
this shelter, but not before the boat was nearly filled with water, and we 
were all wet to the skin.       At about seven o       clock in the evening
we reached Aldea Gallega, shivering with cold and in a most deplorable 
plight.
Aldea Gallega, or the Galician Village, for the two words have that 
signification, is a place containing, I should think, about four thousand 
inhabitants.       It was pitchy dark when we landed, but rockets soon 
began to fly about in all directions, illumining the air far and 
wide.       As we passed along the dirty unpaved street which leads to the 
Largo or square in which the town is situated, a horrible uproar of 
drums and voices assailed our ears.       On enquiring the cause of all 
this bustle, I was informed that it was the Eve of the Conception of the 
Blessed Virgin.       As it was not the custom of the people of the inn to 
provide provisions for the guests, I wandered about in search of food, and 
at last seeing some soldiers eating and drinking in a sort of wine-house, I
went in and asked the people to let me have some supper.       In a short 
time they furnished me with a tolerable meal, for which, however, they 
charged two crowns.
Having engaged with a person for mules to carry us to Evora, which were 
to be ready at five next morning, I soon retired to bed, my servant 
sleeping in the same apartment, which was the only one in the house 
vacant.       I closed not an eye during the whole night; beneath us was a 
stable in which some almocreves, or carriers, slept with their 
mules, and at our back in the yard was a hog-stye.       How could I 
sleep?       The hogs grunted; the mules screamed; and the 
almocreves snored most horribly.       I heard the village clock 
strike the hours until midnight, and from midnight till four in the 
morning, when I sprang up and began to dress, and despatched my servant to 
hasten the man with his mules, for I was heartily tired of the place, and 
wished to leave it.
An old man, but remarkably bony and hale, accompanied by a bare-footed 
lad, brought the beasts.       He was the proprietor of them, and intended 
to accompany us to Evora with the lad, who was his nephew.       When we 
started the moon was shining brightly, and the morning was piercingly 
cold.       We soon entered a sandy, hollow way, emerging from which we 
passed by a large edifice, standing on a high, bleak sand-hill, on our 
left.       We were speedily overtaken by five or six men on horseback, 
riding at a rapid pace, each with a long gun slung at his saddle, the 
muzzle depending about two feet below the horses belly.       I questioned 
the old man as to the cause of their going thus armed; he answered that the
roads were very bad (meaning that they abounded with robbers), and that 
these people carried arms for their defence.       They soon turned off to 
the right towards Palmella.
We reached a sandy plain studded with stunted pine; the road was little 
more than a footpath, and as we proceeded the trees thickened and became a 
wood, which extended for two leagues with clear spaces at intervals, in 
which herds of cattle and sheep were feeding.       The sun was just 
beginning to show itself, but the morning was misty and dreary, which 
together with the aspect of desolation which the country exhibited had an 
unfavourable effect on my spirits.       I got down and walked, entering 
into conversation with the man.       He seemed to have but one theme of 
conversation,        the robbers        and the atrocities they were in the
habit of practising in the very spots we were passing.       The tales he 
related were truly horrible, and to avoid them I mounted again and rode on 
considerably in front.
In about an hour and a half we emerged from the forest and entered upon 
wild broken ground covered with mato or brushwood.       The mules 
stopped to drink at a shallow pool, and on looking to the right I saw a 
ruined wall.       This, the guide informed me, was the remains of the 
Vendal Velhas, or the old inn, formerly the haunt of the celebrated robber 
Sabocha.       This Sabocha, it seems, had, about sixteen years since, a 
band of forty ruffians at his command, who infested these wilds, and 
supported themselves by plunder.       For a considerable time Sabocha 
pursued his atrocious trade unsuspected, and many an unfortunate traveller 
was murdered, in the dead of night, at the solitary inn by the wood       s
side, which he kept; indeed a more fit situation for plunder and murder I 
never saw.       The gang were in the habit of watering their horses at the
pool, and perhaps of washing therein their hands stained with the blood of 
their victims.       The brother of Sabocha was the lieutenant of the 
troop, a fellow of great strength and ferocity, particularly famous for the
skill he possessed in darting a long knife and transfixing his 
opponents.       Sabocha       s connection with the gang at last became 
known, and he fled with the greatest part of his associates across the 
Tagus, to the northern provinces.       He and his brother eventually lost 
their lives on the road to Coimbra, in an engagement with the 
military.       His house was razed by order of the Government.
The ruins of this house are still frequently visited by banditti, who 
eat and drink amongst the stones and look out for prey, as the place 
commands a view of the road.       The old man assured me that about two 
months previous, on returning from Aldea Gallega with his mules from 
accompanying some travellers, he had been knocked down, stript naked, and 
had all his money taken from him, by a fellow who, he believed, came from 
this murderers        nest.       He said that he was an exceedingly 
powerful young man with immense moustaches and whiskers, and was armed with
an espingarda or musket.       About ten days subsequently he saw 
the robber at Vendas Novas, where we were to pass the night.       The 
fellow on recognising him took him aside and threatened, with horrid 
imprecations, that he should never be permitted to return home if he 
attempted to discover him; he therefore held his peace, as he said there 
was little to be gained and everything to be lost by apprehending him, as 
he would have been speedily set at liberty for want of evidence to 
criminate him, and then he would not have failed to have his revenge, or 
would have been anticipated therein by his comrades.
I dismounted and went up to the place, and saw the vestiges of a fire 
and a broken bottle.       The sons of plunder had been there very 
lately.       I left a New Testament and some tracts amongst the ruins, and
hastened away.
The sun had dispelled the mists and was beaming very hot; we rode on for
about an hour, when I heard the neighing of a horse in our rear, and our 
guide said that there was a party of horsemen behind.       Our mules were 
good, and they did not overtake us for at least twenty minutes.       The 
foremost rider was a gentleman in a fashionable travelling dress; a little 
way behind were an officer, two soldiers, and a servant in livery.       I 
heard the principal horseman, on overtaking Anthonio, enquiring who I was, 
and whether I was French or English.       He was told I was an English 
gentleman, travelling.       He then asked whether I understood Portuguese;
the man said I understood it, but that he believed I spoke French and 
Italian better.       The gentleman then spurred on his horse and accosted 
me, not in Portuguese, or in French, or Italian, but in the purest English 
that I have ever heard spoken by a foreigner.       It had indeed nothing 
of foreign accent or pronunciation in it, and had I not known by the 
countenance of the speaker that he was no Englishman (for there is a 
peculiarity in the English countenance which, though it cannot be 
described, is sure to betray the Englishman), I should have concluded that 
I was conversing with a countryman.       He continued in company and 
discourse until we arrived at Pegoens.
Pegoens consists of about two or three houses and an inn; there is 
likewise a species of barrack, where half a dozen soldiers are 
stationed.       In the whole of Portugal there is no place of worse 
reputation, and the inn is nicknamed Estalagem de Ladroens, or the 
hostelry of thieves; for it is there that the banditti of the wilderness, 
which extends around it on every side for leagues, are in the habit of 
coming and spending the fruits of their criminal daring; there they dance 
and sing, feast on fricasseed rabbits and olives, and drink the muddy but 
strong wine of the Alemtejo.       An enormous fire, fed by the trunk of a 
cork-tree, was blazing in a niche on the left hand on entering the spacious
kitchen; by it, seething, were several large jars, which emitted no 
disagreeable odour, and reminded me that I had not yet broken my fast, 
although it was now nearly one o       clock and I had ridden five 
leagues.       Some wild-looking men, who, if they were not banditti, might
easily be mistaken for such, were seated on logs about the fire; I asked 
them some unimportant question, to which they replied with readiness and 
civility, and one of them, who said he could read, accepted a tract which I
offered him.
My new friend, who had been bespeaking dinner, or rather breakfast, now 
with great civility invited me to partake of it, and at the same time 
introduced me to the officer who accompanied him, and who was his brother, 
and also spoke English, though not so well as himself.       I found I had 
become acquainted with Don Geronimo Joz         d       Azveto, Secretary 
to the Government at Evora.       His brother belonged to a regiment of 
hussars, whose headquarters were at Evora, but which had outlying parties 
along the road; for example, at the place where we were stopping.       
Rabbits at Pegoens seem to be a standard article of food, being produced in
abundance on the moors around.       We had one fricasseed, the gravy of 
which was delicious; and afterwards a roasted one, which was brought up on 
a dish entire.       The hostess having first washed her hands proceeded to
tear the animal to pieces, which having accomplished she poured over the 
fragments a sweet sauce.       I ate remarkably heartily of both dishes, 
particularly of the last, owing perhaps to the novel and curious manner in 
which it was served up.       Excellent figs from the Algarves and apples 
completed our repast, which we ate in a little side room with a mud-floor, 
which sent such a piercing chill into my system as prevented me from 
deriving that pleasure from my good fare and agreeable companions which I 
might otherwise have experienced.       Don Joz         d       Azveto had 
been educated in England, in which country he passed his boyhood, which to 
a certain degree accounted for his proficiency in the English language, the
idioms and pronunciation of which can only be acquired by a residence in 
the country at that period of one       s life.       He had also fled 
thither shortly after the usurpation of the throne of Portugal by Don 
Miguel, and from thence had passed over to the Brazils, where he had 
devoted himself to the service of Don Pedro, and had followed him in that 
expedition which terminated in the downfall of the Usurper and the 
establishment of the constitutional government in Portugal.       Our 
conversation rolled chiefly on literary and political subjects, and my 
acquaintance with the writings of the most celebrated authors of Portugal 
was hailed with surprise and delight; for nothing is more gratifying to a 
well-educated Portuguese than to observe a foreigner taking an interest in 
the literature of his nation, of which he is so justly proud.
About two o       clock we were once more in the saddle, and pursued our
way through a country exactly resembling that which we had previously been 
traversing, rugged and broken, with here and there a clump of pines.       
The afternoon was exceedingly fine, and the bright rays of the sun relieved
the desolation of the scene.       Having advanced about two leagues, I 
caught sight of a large edifice in the distance, which I learnt was a royal
palace, standing at the farther extremity of Vendas Novas, the village 
where we were to halt.       It was considerably more than a league from 
us, yet, seen through the clear transparent atmosphere of Portugal, it 
appeared much nearer.       Before reaching it, we passed by a stone cross,
on the pedestal of which was an inscription commemorating a horrible murder
of a native of Lisbon, which had been perpetrated on that spot.       It 
looked ancient, and was covered with moss, and the greatest part of the 
inscription was illegible, at least it was to me, who could not bestow much
time on the deciphering of it.
Having arrived at Vendas Novas and bespoke supper, my new friends and 
myself strolled forth to view the palace.       It was built by the late 
King of Portugal, and presents little that is remarkable in its 
exterior.       It is a long edifice with wings, and is only two stories 
high, though it can be seen afar, owing to its being situated on elevated 
ground.       It has fifteen windows in the upper and twelve in the lower 
story, with a paltry-looking door something like that of a barn, the ascent
to which is by a single step.       The interior corresponds with the 
exterior, offering nothing which can gratify curiosity, if we except the 
kitchens, which are indeed magnificent, and so large that food enough might
be prepared in them to serve as a repast to all the inhabitants of the 
Alemtejo.       I passed the night with great comfort in a clean bed, 
remote from all those noises in general so rife in a Portuguese inn, and 
the next morning at six we again set out on our journey, which we hoped to 
terminate before sunset, as Evora is but ten leagues from Vendas 
Novas.       The preceding morning had been cold, but the present one was 
far more, so much so that just before sunrise I could no longer support it 
whilst riding, and therefore dismounting ran and walked until we reached a 
few houses, at the termination of these desolate moors.       It was in one
of these houses that the commissioners of Don Pedro and Miguel met, and it 
was there agreed that the latter should resign the crown in favour of Donna
Maria; for Evora was the last stronghold of the Usurper, and the moors of 
the Alemtejo the last area of the combats which so long agitated unhappy 
Portugal.       I therefore gazed on the miserable huts with considerable 
interest, and did not fail to scatter in the neighbourhood several of the 
precious little tracts with which, together with a small quantity of 
Bibles, my carpet-bag was provided.
The country began to improve, the savage heaths were left behind, and we
saw hills and dales, cork-trees and azineirias, on the last of which
trees grows that kind of sweet acorn called bolota, which is 
pleasant as a chestnut, and forms in winter the principal food on which the
numerous swine of the Alemtejo subsist.       Gallant swine they are, with 
short legs and portly bodies, of a black or dark-red colour, and for the 
excellence of their flesh I can avouch, having frequently partaken of it in
the course of my wanderings in this province.       The lumbo, or 
loin, when broiled on the live embers, is delicious, especially when eaten 
with olives.
We were now in sight of Monte Moro, which as the name denotes was once a
fortress of the Moors; it is a high, steep hill, on the summit and sides of
which are ruined walls and towers.       At its western side is a deep 
ravine or valley, through which a small stream rushes, traversed by a stone
bridge; farther down there is a ford, through which we passed and ascended 
to the town, which commencing near the northern base, passes over the lower
ridge towards the north-east; the town is exceedingly picturesque, and many
of the houses are very ancient and built in the Moorish fashion.       I 
wished much to examine the relics of Moorish sway on the upper part of the 
mountain, but time pressed, and the shortness of our stay in this place did
not permit me to gratify my inclination.
Monte Moro is the head of a range of hills crossing this part of the 
Alemtejo, and from hence they fork towards the east and south-east, in the 
former of which directions lies the direct road to Elvas, Badajoz, and 
Madrid, and in the latter the road to Evora.       A beautiful mountain, 
covered to the top with cork trees, is the third in the chain which skirts 
the way in the direction of Evora.       It is called Monte Almo; a brook 
brawls at its base, and as I passed it the sun was shining gloriously on 
the green herbage, on which flocks of goats were feeding with their bells 
ringing merrily, so that the tout ensemble resembled a fairy scene; 
and that nothing might be wanted to complete the picture, I here met a man,
a goat-herd, beneath an azineiria whose appearance recalled to my 
mind the Brute-man mentioned in an ancient Danish poem:

       A wild swine on his shoulders he kept,
And upon his bosom a black bear slept,
And about his fingers with hair o       erhung
The squirrel sported and weasel clung.       

Upon the shoulders of the goat-herd was a beast, which he told me was a 
lontra or otter, which he had lately caught in the neighbouring 
brook, it had a string round its neck which was attached to his arm; at his
left side was a bag from the top of which peeped the heads of two or three 
singular-looking animals; and beside him was squatted the sullen cub of a 
wolf, which he was endeavouring to tame.       His whole appearance was to 
the last degree savage and wild.       After a little conversation, such as
those who meet on the road frequently hold, I asked him if he could read; 
but he made no answer.       I then enquired if he knew anything of God or 
Jesus Christ; he looked me fixedly in the face for a moment, and then 
turned his countenance towards the sun which was beginning to sink, nodded 
to it, and then again looked fixedly upon me.       I believed I understood
this mute reply, which probably was, that it was God who made that glorious
light which illumines and gladdens all creation; and gratified with this 
belief I left him, and hastened after my companions who were, by this time,
a considerable way in advance.
I have always found amongst the children of the fields a more determined
tendency to religion and piety than amongst the inhabitants of towns and 
cities, and the reason is obvious; they are less acquainted with the works 
of man       s hands than with those of God; their occupations are simple, 
and requiring less of ingenuity and skill than those which engage the 
intention of the other portion of their fellow-creatures, are less 
favourable to the engendering of self-conceit and sufficiency, so utterly 
at variance with that lowliness of spirit which constitutes the best test 
of piety.       The sneerers and scoffers at religion do not spring from 
amongst the simple children of nature, but are the excrescences of 
overwrought refinement, and though their baneful influence has indeed 
penetrated to the country and corrupted many there, the fountain-head was 
amongst crowded houses where nature is scarcely known.       I am not one 
of those who look for perfection amongst the rural population of any 
country; perfection is not to be found amongst the children of the fall, be
their abode where it may; but until the heart disbelieve the existence of a
God, there is still hope for the possessor, however stained with crime he 
may be, for even Simon the Magician was converted.       But when the heart
is once steeled with infidelity, infidelity confirmed by carnal reasoning, 
an exuberance of the grace of God is required to melt it, which is seldom 
or never manifested; for we read in the blessed book that the Pharisee and 
the Wizard became receptacles of grace, but where is mention made of the 
conversion of the sneering Sadducee? and is the modern infidel aught but a 
Sadducee of later date?
To be continued.

Journal continued
Badajoz, 10th 
January 1836.
The night had closed in before we reached Evora, and having taken leave 
of my friends, who kindly requested me to consider their house my home, 
myself and my little party proceeded to the Largo de San Francisco, where 
was a hostelry, which the muleteer informed me was the best in the 
town.       We rode into the kitchen, at the extreme end of which was the 
stable, as is customary in Portugal.       The house was kept by an aged 
gypsy-like female and her daughter, a fine blooming girl about eighteen 
years of age.       The house was large; in the upper story was a very long
room, like a granary, extending nearly the whole length of the house; the 
further end was partitioned off, and formed a tolerably comfortable 
chamber, but rather cold, the floor being of tiles, as was that of the 
large room in which the muleteers were accustomed to sleep on the furniture
of their mules.       Having supped I went to bed, and after having offered
up my devotions to Him who had protected me through a dangerous journey, I 
slept soundly till the morning.
Evora is a walled town, but not regularly fortified, and could not 
sustain a siege of a day.       It has five gates; before that to the 
south-west is the principal promenade of the inhabitants; the fair on St. 
John       s Day is likewise held there.       The houses are mostly very 
ancient; many of them are unoccupied.       It contains about five thousand
inhabitants, though twice that number would be by no means disproportionate
to its size.       The two principal edifices are the See or Bishop       s
Palace, and the Convent of San Francisco, opposite to which I had taken up 
my abode.       A large barrack for cavalry stands on the right-hand side 
on entering the south-west gate.       The adjacent country is 
uninteresting; but to the south-east, at the distance of six leagues, is to
be seen a range of blue hills, the highest of which is called Serra 
Dorso.       It is picturesquely beautiful, and contains within its 
recesses wolves and wild boars in numbers.       About a league and a half 
on the other side of this hill is Estremoz.
I passed the day succeeding my arrival principally in examining the town
and its environs, and as I strolled about I entered into conversation with 
various people that I met.       Several of these were of the middle 
classes, shopkeepers and professional men; they were all 
Constitutionalists, or pretended to be so, but had very little to say, 
except a few commonplace remarks on the way of living of the friars, their 
hypocrisy and laziness.       I endeavoured to obtain some information 
respecting the state of instruction at Evora, and from their replies was 
led to believe that it must be very low, for it seemed that there was 
neither book-shop nor school in the place.       When I spoke of religion, 
they exhibited the utmost apathy, and making their bows left me as soon as 
possible.       Having a letter of introduction to a person who kept a shop
in the market-place, I called upon him, found him behind his counter and 
delivered it to him.       I found that he had been persecuted much whilst 
the old system was in its vigour, and that he entertained a hearty aversion
to it.       I told him that the nurse of that system had been the 
ignorance of the people in religious matters, and that the surest means to 
prevent its return was to enlighten them in those points.       I added 
that I had brought with me to Evora a small stock of Testaments and Bibles,
which I wished to leave for sale in the hands of some respectable merchant,
and that if he were desirous to lay the axe to the root of superstition and
tyranny he could not do so more effectually than by undertaking the charge 
of these books.       He declared his willingness to do so, and that same 
evening I sent him ten Testaments and a Bible, being half my stock.
I returned to the hostelry, and sat down on a log of wood on the hearth 
within the immense chimney in the common apartment.       Two men were on 
their knees on the stones; before them was a large heap of pieces of iron, 
brass, and copper; they were assorting it and stowing it away in various 
large bags.       They were Spanish contrabandistas, or smugglers of
the lowest class, and earned a miserable livelihood by smuggling such 
rubbish from Portugal into Spain.       Not a word proceeded from their 
lips, and when I addressed them in their native language they returned no 
answer but a kind of growl.       They looked as dirty and rusty as the 
iron in which they trafficked.       The woman of the house and her 
daughter were exceedingly civil, and coming near to me crouched down, 
asking various questions about England.       A man dressed something like 
an English sailor, who sat on the other side of the hearth, confronting me,
said:        I hate the English, for they are not baptized, and have not 
the law        (meaning the law of God).       I laughed, and told him, 
that according to the law of England no one who was not baptized could be 
buried in consecrated ground; whereupon he said;        Then you are 
stricter than we.              He then asked:        What is meant by the 
lion and the unicorn which I saw the other day on the coat of arms over the
door of the English consul at St. Uves?              I said that they were 
the arms of England.              Yes,        he replied;        but what 
do they represent?              I said I did not know.       
       Then,        said he,        you do not know the story of your own 
house.              I answered:        Suppose I were to tell you that they
represented the lion of Belem (Bethlehem) and the horned monster of the 
flaming pit in combat as to which should obtain the mastery in England, 
what would you say?              He replied:        I should say that you 
gave a fair answer.              This man and myself became great friends; 
he came from Palmella, not far from St. Uves; he had several mules and 
horses with him, and dealt in corn and barley.
I again walked out in the environs of the town.       About half a mile 
from the southern wall is a stone fountain, where the muleteers and other 
people approaching the town are accustomed to water their cattle.       I 
sat down by it, and there I remained about two hours, entering into 
discourse with every one who halted at the fountain; and I will here 
observe that during the time of my sojourn at Evora I repeated my visit 
every day, and remained there about the same time, and by following this 
plan I believe that I spoke to near two hundred of the children of Portugal
upon matters connected with their eternal welfare.       Of those whom I 
addressed I found very few had received any species of literary education; 
none of them had seen the Bible, and not more than half a dozen had the 
slightest knowledge of what the Holy Book consisted.       I found that 
most of them were bigoted Romanists and Miguelites at heart.       When 
they told me they were Christians, I denied the possibility of their being 
so, as they were ignorant of Christ and His commandments, and rested their 
hope of salvation in outward forms and superstitious observances which were
the inventions of Satan, who wished to keep them in darkness in order that 
at last they might stumble into the pit which he had digged for them.      
I said repeatedly that the Pope whom they revered was a deceiver and the 
prime minister of Satan here on earth, and that the monks and friars, to 
whom they had been accustomed to confess themselves, and whose absence they
so deplored, were his subordinate agents.       When called upon for 
proofs, I invariably cited the ignorance of my hearers respecting the 
Scripture, and said that if their spiritual guides had been really 
ministers of Christ they would not have permitted their flocks to remain 
unacquainted with His word.       Since this occasion I have been 
frequently surprised that I received no insult or ill-treatment from the 
people whose superstitions I was thus attacking, but I really experienced 
none; and am inclined to believe that the utter fearlessness which I 
displayed, trusting in the protection of the Almighty, may have been the 
cause.       When threatened by danger the best policy is to fix your eye 
steadily upon it, and it will in general vanish like the morning mist 
before the sun; whereas if you quail before it, it becomes more 
imminent.       I have fervent hope that the words which I uttered sunk 
deep into the hearts of some of my hearers, as I observed many of them 
depart musing and pensive.       I occasionally distributed tracts among 
them, for although they themselves were unable to turn them to much 
account, I thought that by their means they might become of service at some
future time, and might fall into the hands of others to whom they might be 
instruments of regeneration; as many a book which is cast on the waters is 
wafted to some remote shore, and there proves a blessing and a comfort to 
millions who are ignorant from whence it came.
The next day, which was Friday, I called at the house of my friend 
Azveto; I did not find him there, but was directed to the Episcopal Palace,
in an apartment of which I found him writing with another gentleman, to 
whom he introduced me.       It was the Governor of Evora, who welcomed me 
with every mark of kindness and affability.       After some discourse we 
went out together to examine an ancient edifice, which was reported to have
served in ancient times as a temple to Diana.       Part of it was 
evidently of Roman architecture, for there was no mistaking the beautiful 
light pillars which supported a dome, under which the sacrifices to the 
most captivating and poetical divinity of the heathen Theocracy had 
probably been made; but the original space between the pillars had been 
filled up with rubbish of a modern date, and the rest of the building was 
apparently of the architecture of the latter end of the middle ages.       
It is situated at one end of the building which was once the seat of the 
Inquisition, and I was informed that before the erection of the present 
See, it served as the residence of the Bishop.
Within the See, where the Governor now resides, is a superb library, 
occupying an immense vaulted room, like the aisle of a cathedral, and in a 
side apartment is a collection of pictures by Portuguese artists, chiefly 
portraits, amongst which is that of Don Sebastian.       I hope it did not 
do him justice; for it represents him in the shape of an awkward lad, of 
about eighteen, with staring eyes and a bloated booby face, and wearing a 
ruff round a short apoplectic neck.
I was shown several beautifully illuminated missals and other 
manuscripts, but the one which most arrested my attention, I scarcely need 
say why, bore the following title:       
Forma sive ordinatio Capelli illustrissimi et xtianissimi principis 
Henrici sexti Regis Anglie et Francie am diu Hibernie descipta serenissio 
principi Alfonso Regi Portugalie illustri per humilem servitorem sm Willm 
Sav Decanum capelli supradicti.
It seemed a voice from the olden times of my dear native land.       
This library and picture-gallery had been formed by one of the latter 
Bishops, a person of commendable learning and piety.
In the evening I dined with Don Joz         d       Azveto and his 
brother; the latter soon left us, in order to attend to his military 
duties.       My friend and myself had then much conversation of 
considerable interest.       He lamented feelingly the deplorable state of 
ignorance in which his countrymen were at present buried, and said that his
friend the Governor and himself were endeavouring to establish a school in 
the vicinity, and that they had made application to the Government for the 
use of an empty convent called the Espinhero, or thorn-tree, at 
about a league       s distance, and that they had little doubt of their 
request being complied with.       I had before told him who I was; and 
now, after expressing my joy at the plan which he had in contemplation, I 
urged him in the most pressing manner to use all his influence to cause the
knowledge of the Scripture to be the basis of the education of the pupils 
in the intended school, and added that half of the Testaments and Bibles 
which I had brought with me to Evora were heartily at his service.       He
instantly gave me his hand, [and] said he accepted my offer with the 
greatest pleasure, and would do all in his power to further my views, which
were in many respects his own.       I now told him that I did not come to 
Portugal with the view of introducing the dogmas of any particular sect, 
but with the hope of introducing the Bible, which is the well-head of all 
that is useful and conducive to the happiness of society and individuals; 
that I cared not what people called themselves, provided they read the 
Scripture, for that where the Scripture was read neither priestcraft nor 
tyranny could long exist; and instanced my own country, the cause of whose 
freedom and happiness was the Bible, and that only, for that before the 
days of Tyndal it was the seat of ignorance, oppression, and cruelty, and 
that after the fall of ignorance, the oppression and cruelty soon ceased, 
for that the last persecutor of the Bible, the last upholder of 
ignorance       the bloody and infamous Mary       was the last 
tyrant who had sat on the throne of England.       We did not part till the
night was considerably advanced; and the next day I sent him the books, in 
the steadfast hope that a bright and glorious morning was about to rise 
upon the night which had so long cast its dreary shadow over the regions of
the Alemtejo.
The day after this interesting event, which was Saturday, I had more 
conversation with the man from Palmella.       I asked him if in his 
journeys he had never been attacked by robbers; he answered 
       No,        for that he generally travelled in company with others; 
       however,        said he,        were I alone I should have little 
fear, for I am well protected.              I said that I supposed he 
carried arms with him.              No other arms than this,        said 
he, and he pulled out a long, desperate-looking knife of English 
manufacture, like that with which every Portuguese peasant is provided, and
which I should consider a far more efficient weapon than a dagger.       
       But,        said he,        I do not place much confidence in the 
knife.              I then enquired in what were his hopes of 
protection.              In this,        he replied; and unbuttoning his 
waistcoat he showed me a small bag, attached to his neck by a silken 
string.              In this bag is an ora        am (or prayer), 
written by a person of power; and as long as I carry it about me no ill can
befall me.              Curiosity is one of the leading features of my 
character, and I instantly said that to be allowed to read the prayer would
give me great pleasure.              Well,        he replied,        you 
are my friend, and I would do for you what I would do for few others.      
I will show it you.              He then asked me for my penknife and 
proceeded to unrip the bag, and took out of it a large piece of paper 
closely folded up.       I hurried with it to my chamber, and commenced the
examination of it.       It was scrawled over in a very illegible hand, and
was moreover much stained with perspiration, so that I had considerable 
difficulty in making myself master of its contents; but at last I 
accomplished the following literal translation of the charm, which was 
written in bad Portuguese, but which struck me at the time as being the 
most remarkable composition I had ever seen.
The Charm

       Just Judge and divine Son of the Virgin Maria, who wast born at 
Bethlehem, a Nazarene, and who wast crucified in the midst of all 
Jewry!       I beseech Thee, O Lord, by virtue of Thy sixth day  a 
name="citation137">[137] 
that the body of me, Francisco, be not caught nor put to death by the hands
of Justice!       Pazes teco (pax tecum), pazes Cristo.       May you 
receive peace, said Christ to His disciples.       If the accursed Justice 
should distrust me, or have its eye on me, in order to take me, or to rob 
me, may it have an eye which shall not see me; may it have a mouth which 
shall not speak to me; may it have an ear which shall not hear me; may it 
have a hand which shall not seize me; may it have a foot which shall not 
overtake me; for may I be armed with the arms of Saint George; may I be 
covered with the cloak of Abraham; and embarked in the ark of Noah; so that
it can neither see me, nor hear me, nor draw the blood from my body!       
I also conjure Thee, O Lord, by those three blessed crosses       by those 
three blessed chalices       by those three blessed clergymen       by 
those three consecrated hosts, that Thou give me that sweet company which 
Thou gavest the Virgin Maria, from the gates of Bethlehem even unto the 
portals of Jerusalem, that I may go and come with peace and joy with Jesus 
Christ, Son of the Virgin Maria, the prolific, yet nevertheless the eternal
Virgin Maria our Lady.       

The woman of the house and her daughter had similar bags tied to their 
necks, containing charms, which they said prevented the witches having 
power to harm them.       The belief in witchcraft is very prevalent 
amongst the peasantry of the Alemtejo, and I believe of other provinces of 
Portugal.       This is one of the relics of the monkish system, the aim of
which in all countries where it has existed, or does exist, seems to be to 
besot the minds of the people that they may be the more easily plundered 
and misled.       The monks of the Greek and Syriac Churches likewise deal 
in this kind of ware, which they know to be poison, but which, as it brings
them a price and fosters delusion by which they are maintained in luxury 
and idleness, they would rather vend than the wholesome drug.
The Sunday morning was fine, and the plain before the church of the 
Convent of San Francisco was thronged with people going to mass or 
returning.       After having performed my morning devotions and 
breakfasted, I went down to the kitchen.       The fine girl Geronima was 
seated by the fire.       I asked if she had heard mass; she replied, 
       No,        and that she did not intend to hear it.       Upon my 
inquiring her motive for absenting herself, she replied that, since the 
friars had been expelled from their churches and convents, she had ceased 
to attend mass or to confess herself, for that the Government priests had 
no spiritual power, and consequently she never troubled them.       She 
said the friars were holy men and charitable; for that every morning those 
of the convent over the way had fed forty poor persons with the remains of 
their meals of the preceding day, but that now these people were allowed to
starve.       I replied that the friars who had lived upon the dainties of 
the land could well afford to bestow a few bones on the poor, and that 
their doing so was not the effect of charity, but merely a part of their 
artful policy, by which they hoped to secure to themselves friends in time 
of need.       The girl then said that as it was Sunday I should perhaps 
like to see some of her books, and without waiting for a reply she produced
them.       They consisted principally of popular stories and lives and 
miracles of saints, but amongst them was a translation of Volney       s 
Ruins of Empires.       I inquired how she became possessed of this 
book; she said that a young man, a great Constitutionalist, had given it 
her some months since and had pressed her much to read it, telling her that
it was the best book in the world.       Whereupon I told her that the 
author of the book in question was an emissary of Satan and an enemy of 
Jesus Christ and the souls of mankind; that he had written it with the sole
view of bringing all religion into contempt, and that he had inculcated 
therein the doctrine that there was no future state nor rewards for the 
righteous nor punishments for the wicked.       She made no reply, but 
going into another room, returned with her apron full of dry brushwood and 
faggot; all of this she piled upon the fire, and produced a bright 
blaze.       She then took the book from my hand, and placed it upon the 
flaming pile; then sitting down, took her rosary out of her pocket, and 
told her beads till the volume was consumed.       This was an 
Auto-da-f        , in the true sense of the word.
On the Monday and Tuesday I paid my usual visits to the fountain, and 
likewise rode about the neighbourhood for the purpose of circulating 
tracts.       I dropped a great many in the favourite walks of the people 
of Evora, as I felt rather dubious of their accepting them had I proffered 
them with my own hands; whereas if they found them on the ground, I thought
that curiosity might induce them to pick them up and examine them.       I 
likewise on the Tuesday evening paid a farewell visit to my friend Don 
Azveto, as it was my intention to leave Evora on the Thursday following; in
which view I had engaged a cabriolet of a man who informed me that he had 
served as a soldier in the Grande Arm        e of Napoleon, and had 
been present throughout the Russian campaign.       He looked the image of 
a drunkard; his face was covered with carbuncles, and his breath 
impregnated with the fumes of strong waters.       He wished much to 
converse with me in French, in the speaking of which language, it seems, he
prided himself much; but I refused, and told him to speak the language of 
the country, or I would hold no discourse with him.
Wednesday was stormy, with occasional rain.       On coming down I found
that my friend from Palmella had departed, but several 
contrabandistas had arrived from Spain.       They were mostly fine 
fellows, and, unlike the two I had seen the previous week, who were of much
lower degree, were chatty and communicative; they spoke their native 
language and no other, and seemed to hold Portuguese in great contempt; 
their magnificent Spanish tones were heard to great advantage amidst the 
shrill chirping dialect of Portugal.       I was soon in deep conversation 
with them, and was much pleased to find that all of them could read.       
I presented the eldest of them, a man of about fifty years of age, with a 
tract in Spanish.       He examined it for some time with great attention; 
he then rose from his seat, and going into the middle of the apartment, 
began reading it aloud, slowly and emphatically; his companions gathered 
round him, and every now and then expressed their satisfaction at what they
heard.       The reader occasionally called upon me to explain particular 
passages which, as they referred to Scripture, he did not exactly 
understand, for not one of the party had ever seen either the Old or New 
Testament.       He continued reading for nearly an hour until he had 
finished the tract, and at its conclusion the whole party were clamorous 
for similar ones, with which I was happy to be able to supply them.       
Most of them spoke of priestcraft and the monks with the utmost abhorrence,
and said that they should prefer death to again submitting to the yoke 
which had formerly galled their necks.       I questioned them very 
particularly respecting the opinion of their neighbours and acquaintances 
on this point, and they assured me that in their part of the Spanish 
frontier all were of the same mind, and that they cared as little for the 
Pope and his monks as they did for Don Carlos, for the latter was a dwarf 
(chicotito) and a tyrant, and the others were plunderers and 
robbers.       I told them that they must beware of confounding religion 
with priestcraft, and that in their abhorrence of the latter they must not 
forget that there is a God and a Christ, to whom they must look for 
salvation, and whose word it was incumbent upon them to study on every 
occasion; whereupon they all expressed a devout belief in Christ and the 
Virgin.
These men, though in many respects far more enlightened than the 
surrounding peasantry, were in others quite as much in the dark; they 
believed in witchcraft and in the efficacy of particular charms.       The 
night was very stormy, and about nine we heard a galloping towards the 
door, and then a loud knocking; it was opened, and in rushed a wild-looking
man mounted upon a donkey.       He wore a jerkin of sheepskin, called in 
Spanish zamarras, with breeches of the same as far down as his knee;
his legs were bare.       Around his sombrero, or shadowy hat, was 
tied a large quantity of the herb called in English rosemary, in Spanish 
romero, and in the rustic language of Portugal ellecrin, 
which last is a word of Scandinavian origin, and properly signifies the 
elfin plant.       [It was probably] carried into the south by the Vandals 
or the Alani.       The [man seemed] frantic with terror, and said that the
witches had been pursuing him, and hovering over his head, for the last two
leagues.       He came from the Spanish frontier with meal and other 
articles; he informed us that his wife was following him and would soon 
arrive, and within a quarter of an hour she made her appearance, dripping 
with rain, and also mounted upon a donkey.       I asked my friends the 
contrabandistas why he wore the rosemary in his hat, and they told 
me that it was good against witches and the mischances of the road.       I
had no time to argue against this superstition, for as the chaise was to be
ready at five o       clock next morning I wished to make the most of the 
few hours which I could devote to rest.

Madrid, Calle de la 
Zarza,
Feby. 13th, 1836.
The game is now in our own hands, and it is our fault if we do not win 
it, for a little patience and a little prudence is all that is 
required.       I came to Madrid without a single letter of introduction, 
and without knowing an individual there.       I have now some powerful 
friends, and through the kindness of Sir Geo. Villiers, the British 
Ambassador at the Spanish Court, I have had an interview with that most 
singular man, Mendizabal, whom it is as difficult to get nigh as it is to 
approach the North Pole.       I have obtained his promise that when 
matters are in some degree settled in this country, he will allow us to 
commence our operations; but the preposterous idea, which by some means or 
other he has embraced, that we have been endeavouring to foment 
disturbances amongst the slaves of Cuba, prevents his looking upon us with 
favourable eyes.
I now write for orders; if you have received my letters and journals 
(copious extracts from which you had better print), you will see how 
successful I have been in the Alemtejo, as our books are now for sale at 
Evora and Elvas, the two principal towns, and the Gospel of Christ has been
preached to many who were ignorant of it even by name; you will see what I 
have been doing at Badajoz, especially amongst the Spanish Gypsies, whose 
dialect of the Rommany I have so far mastered as to be able to translate 
into it with tolerable ease.       Now, until my friends here and myself 
can claim the fulfilment of Mr. Mendizabal       s promise, do you wish me 
to go to Granada, or back to Badajoz, and finish my translation of St. Luke
into Rommany, with the assistance of the Gypsies of those places, who are 
far more conversant with their native language than their brethren in other
parts of Spain; or shall I return to Lisbon and exert all my interest 
towards the execution of the plan which I communicated first to Mr. Wilby, 
and then to yourself, namely, attempting to induce the Government to adopt 
the Scriptures in the schools which they are about to establish?       
Since I have been at Madrid I have obtained letters to individuals of great
importance at Lisbon, and I know that Don Jos         d       Azveto will 
do anything to serve me within the limits of reason.       Therefore let 
the Committee be summoned, and a resolution forthwith adopted as to my next
course.       I think all our negotiations in the Peninsula may be brought 
to a successful termination in a few months; then you must send over an 
agent, a plain man of business, to engage colporteurs and to come to 
arrangements with booksellers, both in Spain and in the provincial towns of
Portugal, but let him not be a hesitater and starter of needless doubts and
difficulties; anything may be accomplished with a little shrewdness, a 
little boldness, and a great trust in God.       I hope that my exertions 
have afforded satisfaction at home, but if not, let me be allowed to state 
that it was not in my power to accomplish more than I have.       I have 
borne hunger and thirst, cold and fatigue, I have exposed myself to danger 
from robbers, and was near losing my life from the ruffian soldiery at 
Arrayolos, whose bullets so narrowly missed me.       I have been as 
economical as possible, though the charges in Portugal for everything are 
enormous, and a stranger there is like a ship on shore, a mark for 
plunder.       In Spain the people are far more honest, and the charges, 
though high, reasonable in comparison.       Before leaving Lisbon I drew 
on excellent Mr. Wilby for        75; of this sum        12 was remitted to
Malaja, through which place I shall probably pass on my return to 
Lisbon.       I have still remaining by me money sufficient for two months,
I therefore need not enter into a detail of my expenses.       I now wait 
for a letter from you; and when you write, please to remit to me a small 
letter of credit on some one at Madrid, or request Mr. Wilby to do so, as 
he has correspondents here, and in that case communicate my address to 
him.       I give you below an abridgment of my interview with Mr. 
Mendizabal.       I think it will make you laugh.       I have the honour 
to remain, Revd. and dear Sir, etc.,
G. Borrow.
Interview with Mr. Mendizabal
At about 8 o       clock in the morning of the 7th inst. I went to the 
palace, where Mr. Mendizabal resides.       I informed the usher that I 
came from the British Ambassador, whereupon I was shown into a room, and 
after waiting about three hours I was admitted to the presence of the Prime
Minister of Spain.       He was dressed in a morning gown and sat behind a 
table covered with papers.       He is a man of about five-and-forty, 
somewhat above the middle height, with very handsome features, aquiline 
nose and large sparkling eyes; his hair is partly grey.       I presented 
him the letter with which Sir Geo. Villiers had furnished me, and when he 
had read it, I said that before entering upon the matter which more 
immediately brought me to him, I begged leave to set him right upon a point
relating to which he was labouring under considerable error: Sir Geo. 
Villiers had informed me that Mr. M. entertained an opinion that the Bible 
Society had been endeavouring to exercise an undue influence over the minds
of the slave population of Cuba by means of their agents; but that I could 
assure him with truth, that neither directly nor indirectly had they 
exerted or attempted to exert any influence at all over any part of the 
inhabitants of that island, as they had neither sent agents there, nor held
any communication with the residents.       While I was saying this, he 
interrupted me several times, insisting that it was so, and that he had 
documents to prove it.       I told him that it was probable he confounded 
the Bible Society with some other institution for the propagation of 
religion, perhaps with one of the missionary societies, more especially one
of those belonging to the United States, which might have sent individuals 
to the island in question for the purpose of communicating religious 
instruction to the slaves       but all I could say was to no avail; he 
would have it that it was the British Bible Society who had despatched 
missionaries to Cuba to incite the blacks to rise up against their 
masters.       The absurdity of this idea struck me so forcibly that it was
with difficulty I restrained myself from laughing outright.       I at last
said that, whatever he might think to the contrary, the Committee of the 
Bible Society were by no means of that turbulent and outrageous 
disposition; that they were for the most part staid, quiet gentlemen, who 
attended to their own affairs, and a little, and but a little to the 
promulgation of Christ       s Gospel, which, however, they too much 
respected to endeavour to kindle a spirit of insurrection anywhere, as they
all know full well that it is the Word of God says that servants are to 
obey their masters at all times and occasions.       I then requested 
permission to print the New Testament in Spanish at Madrid.       He said 
he should not grant it, for that the New Testament was a very dangerous 
book, especially in disturbed times.       I replied that I was not aware 
that the holy book contained any passages sanctioning blood-shedding and 
violence, but I rather thought that it abounded with precepts of an 
entirely opposite tendency; but he still persisted that it was an improper 
book.       I must here observe that it was with the utmost difficulty I 
obtained an opportunity of explaining myself, on account of the propensity 
which he possesses of breaking in upon the discourse of the person who is 
addressing him; and at last, in self-defence, I was myself obliged to 
infringe the rules of conversation, and to hold on without paying any 
attention to his remarks       not that I gained much by so doing, for he 
plainly told me that he was an obstinate man, and that he never abandoned 
his opinions.       I certainly do not think him the most tractable of men,
but I am inclined to think that he is not ill-natured, as he preserved his 
temper very well during the interview, and laughed heartily at two or three
of my remarks.       At last he said:        I will not give you permission
now: but let the war be concluded, let the factious be beaten, and the case
will be altered; come to me six months hence.              I then requested
to be allowed to introduce into Spain a few copies of the New Testament in 
the Catalan dialect, as we had lately printed a most beautiful edition at 
London, but he still said        No, no,        and when I asked if he had 
any objection to my calling again on the morrow and showing him a copy, he 
made use of these remarkable words:        I do not wish you should come, 
lest you should convince me, and I do not wish to be convinced.

class="smcap">Madrid.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I received your 
letter of the 8th inst., which gave me much pleasure, as I understood from 
it that my humble efforts had afforded satisfaction.       I also received 
the two letters from St. Petersburg which were written by a dear friend of 
that place, to whom I shall trouble you to forward a letter as soon as I 
have an opportunity of writing, which at present I have not, as my time is 
much occupied.
I have to communicate to you what will not fail to be interesting.      
The Spanish press have taken up our affair, and I am at present engaged in 
attempting to lay the foundation of a Bible Society at Madrid, to 
accomplish which the editor of the influential newspaper, the 
Espa        ol, has promised me his assistance.       There has 
already appeared in that journal a most brilliant article which gives the 
history of our Society, and states the advantages which would result to 
Spain from the establishment within its bosom of a society whose aim should
be the propagation of the Scripture, in the Spanish language, amongst the 
population.       Of this article I send extracts below, and shall 
probably, when I have more time, send the whole.       The person whom we 
are looking forward to as a head of the projected institution is a certain 
Bishop, advanced in years, a person of great piety and learning, who has 
himself translated the New Testament in a manner, as I am informed, far 
superior to that of any of his predecessors; but I have not as yet seen it,
and therefore cannot speak positively as to its merits.       However, he 
is disposed to print and circulate it, and if the translation be really an 
excellent one it would not be unwise in us to patronise it, if by so doing 
we could induce him to co-operate with us in our plans for enlightening 
unhappy Spain.       But more of this anon.       I have little doubt that 
the time is almost at hand when the cause of God will triumph in this 
country, and I am exerting every means which I can devise in humbleness of 
heart to help to bring about an event so desirable.       I intend to 
remain a few weeks longer at Madrid at all events, for the present moment 
is too fraught with interest to allow me to quit it immediately.       As 
far as self is concerned I should rejoice to return instantly to Lisbon, 
for I am not partial to Madrid, its climate, or anything it can offer, if I
except its unequalled gallery of pictures; but I did not come hither to 
gratify self but as a messenger of the Word.
May I take the liberty of begging you to write a line to my dear and 
revered friend Mr. Cunningham, informing him that I am in tolerable health,
and that I hope to write myself speedily.       The three letters which you
say have not arrived were, I believe, destroyed by a servant for the sake 
of the postage, but I shall send you parts of my journal to supply the 
deficiency.
Extracts from the        Espa        ol       
       The first founders of the Bible Societies (for by this name they 
were known) immediately comprehended their philosophic and civilising 
mission, and fulfilled the thought of its inventor.       In a short period
the circle of their action expanded itself, and not content with making 
Great Britain alone a participator of this salutary institution, they 
wished to extend it to all countries, and therefore called to their 
assistance the majority of the known languages.       To all the quarters 
of the inhabited world they sent at their own expense agents to traverse 
the countries and discover the best means of disseminating the truths of 
the Bible, and to discover manuscripts of the ancient versions.       They 
did more: convinced of the necessity of placing themselves above the 
miserable considerations of sectarian spirit, they determined that the text
should not be accompanied by any species of note or commentary which might 
provoke the discord which unhappily reigns among the different fractions of
Christianity, which separates more and more their views instead of guiding 
them to the religious end which they propose.
       Thus the doctrine of the Nazarene might be studied with equal 
success by the Greek schismatic and the Catholic Spaniard, by the sectary 
of Calvin and the disciple of Luther: its seed might bless at one and the 
same time the fruitful plains of Asia and the sterile sands of desert 
Arabia, the burning soil of India and the icy land of the ferocious 
Esquimaux.       Antiquity knew no speedier means of conveying its ideas 
than the harangues which the orators pronounced from the summit of the 
tribune, amidst assemblies of thousands of citizens; but modern 
intelligence wished to discover other means infinitely more efficacious, 
more active, more rapid, more universal, and has invented the press.       
Thus it was that in the preceding ages the warm and animated words of the 
missionary were necessarily the only organ which Christianity had at 
command to proclaim its principles; but scarcely did this invention come to
second the progress of modern civilisation, than it foresaw the future ally
destined to complete the intelligent and social labour which it had taken 
upon itself.       
(After stating what has been accomplished by the B. F. B. Society, and 
how many others have sprung up under her auspices in different lands, the 
article continues:)
       Why should Spain which has explored the New World, which has 
generalised inoculation in order to oppose the devastations of a horrid 
pest, which has always distinguished herself by zeal in labouring in the 
cause of humanity       why should she alone be destitute of Bible 
Societies?       Why should a nation eminently Catholic continue isolated 
from the rest of Europe, without joining in the magnificent enterprise in 
which the latter is so busily engaged?

Madrid, No. 3, Calle de la 
Zarza,
20 April 1836
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have received 
your letter of the 6th inst., in which you request me to write to you a 
little more frequently, on the ground that my letters are not destitute of 
interest; your request, however, is not the principal reason which incites 
me to take up the pen at the present moment.       Though I hope that I 
shall be able to communicate matter which will afford yourself and our 
friends at home subject for some congratulation, my more immediate object 
is to inform you of my situation, of which I am sure you have not the 
slightest conception.
For the last three weeks I have been without money, literally without a 
farthing.       About a month ago I received fifteen pounds from Mr. Wilby,
and returned him an order for twenty, he having, when I left Lisbon, lent 
me five pounds, on account, above what I drew for, as he was apprehensive 
of my being short of money before I reached Madrid.              12, 5s. of
this I instantly expended for a suit of clothes,  a 
name="citation153">[153] my
own being so worn, that it was impossible to appear longer in public with 
them.       At the time of sending him the receipt I informed him that I 
was in need of money, and begged that he would send the remaining        30
by return of post.       I have never heard from him from that moment, 
though I have written twice.       Perhaps he never received my letters, or
I may not have received his, the post of Estremadura having been three 
times robbed; I can imagine no other reason.       The money may still 
come, but I have given up all hopes of it, and am compelled to write home, 
though what I am to do till I can receive your answer I am at a loss to 
conceive.       But God is above all, and I am far from complaining; but 
you would oblige me, upon receiving this, to procure me instantly a letter 
of credit on some house in Madrid.       I believe Messrs. Hammersley of 
London have correspondents here.       Whatever I undergo, I shall tell 
nobody my situation: it might hurt the Society and our projects here.      
I know enough of the world to be aware that it is considered as the worst 
of crimes to be without money.       Above all, let me intreat you never to
hint of this affair in any communication to Mr. Wilby; he is a most 
invaluable man, and he might take offence.
A week ago, after having spent much time in drawing up a petition, I 
presented it to the Ecclesiastical Committee of Censors.       It was 
strongly backed by the Civil Governor of Madrid, within whose department 
the Censorship is.       In this petition, after a preamble on the 
religious state of Spain, I requested permission to print the New Testament
without note or comment, according to the version of Father Scio, and in 
the same form and size as the small edition of Paris, in order that the 
book might be        al alcance asi de los pobres como de los 
ricos        (within the reach of the poor as well as of the wealthy). 
 a href="#footnote154" 
class="citation">[154]       The Ecclesiastical Board are at present 
consulting about it, as I was informed to-day, upon my repairing to their 
house for the purpose of knowing how matters were going on.       I have 
hopes of success, having done all in my power to prevent a failure by 
making important friends since the moment of my arrival.       I was 
introduced to the Governor by his most intimate acquaintance Synudi, the 
Deputy of Huelba, to whom I was introduced by the celebrated Alcala de 
Galiano, the Deputy of Cadiz, who will sooner or later be Prime Minister, 
and to him I was introduced by       but I will not continue, as I might 
run on for ever, much after the fashion as
       This is the house which Jack built.       
And now I have something to tell you which I think will surprise you, 
and which, strange as it may sound, is nevertheless true.       The 
authority of the Pope in this country is in so very feeble and precarious a
situation, that little more than a breath is required to destroy it, and I 
am almost confident that in less than a year it will be disowned.       I 
am doing whatever I can in Madrid to prepare the way for an event so 
desirable.       I mix with the people, and inform them who and what the 
Pope is, and how disastrous to Spain his influence has been.       I tell 
them that the indulgences, which they are in the habit of purchasing, are 
of no more intrinsic value than so many pieces of paper, and were merely 
invented with the view of plundering them.       I frequently ask: 
       Is it possible that God, who is good, would sanction the sale of 
sin?        and,        Supposing certain things are sinful, do you think 
that God, for the sake of your money, would permit you to perform 
them?              In many instances my hearers have been satisfied with 
this simple reasoning, and have said that they would buy no more 
indulgences.       Moreover, the newspapers have, in two or three 
instances, taken up the subject of Rome upon national and political 
grounds.       The Pope is an avowed friend of Carlos, and an enemy of the 
present Government, and in every instance has refused to acknowledge the 
Bishops who have been nominated to vacant sees by the Queen.       
Therefore the editors say, and very naturally, if the Pope does everything 
in his power to impede the progress of Spanish regeneration, it is high 
time to cut the ties which still link Spain to the papal chair.       It is
my sincere prayer, and the prayer of many of those who have the interest of
Spain at heart, that The Man of Rome will continue in the course which he 
is at present pursuing, for by so doing he loses Spain, and then he is 
nothing.       He is already laughed at throughout Italy       Ireland will
alone remain to him       much good it may do him!
In respect to the Apocrypha, let me be permitted to observe that an 
anticipation of that difficulty was one of my motives for forbearing to 
request permission to print the entire Bible; and here I will hint that in 
these countries, until the inhabitants become Christian, it would be 
expedient to drop the Old Testament altogether, for if the Old accompany 
the New the latter will be little read, as the former is so infinitely more
entertaining to the carnal man.       Mr. Wilby in his [last] letter 
informs me that 30 Bibles have been sold in Lisbon within a short time, but
that the demand for Testaments has not amounted to half that number.       
My best respects to Mr. Jowett.

Madrid, May 22, 1836.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I write in the 
greatest hurry.       I shall receive the permission, the Lord willing, in 
a few days; the Duke de Rivas has this moment told me so, and he is 
Minister of the Interior.
The Ecclesiastical Court declined deciding upon the matter, and left it 
entirely in the hands of the Ministers.       Just as the English 
Ambassador was about to remind Mr. Mendizabal of his promise to me, the 
latter gentleman and his colleagues retired from office; a new Ministry was
formed composed entirely of my friends, amongst them Alcala Galiano (turn 
to my last letter).
As soon as the Minister of Finance, with whom I am very intimate, 
returns from France, I shall request to be permitted to introduce the 
Catalan New Testament upon paying a reasonable duty.
I received Mr. Jackson       s letter containing the money, and yours, 
also with money, and a rap on the knuckles besides; it was scarcely 
merited, as I can prove in five words.
Not having the Scripture to offer to the people, I was obliged to 
content myself with mentioning it to them; the people here know not the 
Scripture even by name, but they know a certain personage well enough, and 
as soon as the subject of religion is brought up they are sure to bring him
forward, as they consider him the fountainhead of all religion.       Those
therefore in the situation of myself have three things at their option; to 
speak nothing       to speak lies       or to speak the truth.       In 
simpleness of heart I thought proper to adopt the last principle as my line
of conduct; I do not think I have erred, but I shall be more reserved in 
future.
In conclusion let me be permitted to observe that the last skirts of the
cloud of papal superstition are vanishing below the horizon of Spain; 
whoever says the contrary either knows nothing of the matter or wilfully 
hides the truth.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. Borrow.

My dear Sir,       There has been a partial 
disturbance at Madrid, and it is not impossible that the new Ministry will 
go out and Mr. M. be reinstated       which event, however, will make 
little difference to us, as the British Ambassador has promised to back the
application which I shall instantly make.       There are so many changes 
and revolutions here that nothing is certain even for a day.       I wish 
to let you know what is going forward, and am aware that you will excuse 
two letters arriving at one time.

[Madrid], Monday night, half p. 11, 
May 30.
The post will presently depart, therefore I have no time to lose.       
Every thing, thank God, is again tranquil, and it appears that the present 
Ministry will stand its ground.       I am just returned from the house of 
one of the Ministers; I can consequently speak pretty positively.       The
Queen will not accept their resignations, and the army is on their 
side.       The Cortes have been dissolved.       The whole Cabinet are of 
opinion that my petition is just and reasonable and ought to be 
granted.       I have been requested to appear next Thursday at the Office,
when I expect to receive the permission, or to hear that steps have been 
taken towards making it out.
The reason of Mr. Mendizabal       s resignation was his inability to 
accomplish the removal of General Cordova from the head of the army.       
It is not for me to offer an opinion on the General       s military 
talents, but he is much beloved by the soldiers, whose comforts and 
interests he has much attended to; to deprive him of command would 
therefore be attended with danger.       I have no complaint to make 
against Mr. M.; he is a kind, well-meaning man, and had he remained in 
office I have no doubt that he would have acceded to my petition.
I hope you will pray that God will grant me wisdom, humbleness of 
spirit, and success in all that is right.
G. Borrow.

June 30, 1836.
Revd. and dear Sir,       As I have little 
doubt that you are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some intelligence from
me, I write a few lines which I have no doubt will prove satisfactory to 
you, and in the course of a few days I hope to write again, when I shall 
probably be able to announce the happy termination of the affair which 
brought me to Spain.
The difficulties which I have had to encounter since I last wrote to you
have been so many and formidable that I have been frequently on the verge 
of despairing ever to obtain permission to print the Gospel in Spain, which
has become the most ardent wish of my heart.       Only those who have been
in the habit of dealing with Spaniards, by whom the most solemn promises 
are habitually broken, can form a correct idea of my reiterated 
disappointments and of the toil of body and agony of spirit which I have 
been subjected to.       One day I have been told, at the Ministry, that I 
had only to wait a few moments and all I wished would be acceded to; and 
then my hopes have been blasted with the information that various 
difficulties, which seemed insurmountable, had presented themselves, 
whereupon I have departed almost broken-hearted; but the next day I have 
been summoned in a great hurry and informed that        all was 
right,        and that on the morrow a regular authority to print the 
Scriptures would be delivered to me; but by that time fresh and yet more 
terrible difficulties had occurred       so that I became weary of my 
life.
During the greatest part of the last six weeks I have spent upon an 
average ten hours every day, dancing attendance on one or another of the 
Ministers, and when I have returned home I have been so fatigued that I 
have found it impossible to write, even to my nearest friends.       The 
heat has been suffocating, for the air seems to be filled with flaming 
vapours, and the very Spaniards are afraid to stay out, and lie gasping and
naked on their brick floors; therefore if you have felt disappointed in not
having heard from me for a considerable time, the above statement must be 
my excuse.
During the last fortnight the aspect of my affair has become more 
favourable, and, notwithstanding all the disappointments I have met, I now 
look forward with little apprehension to the result.       The English 
Ambassador, Mr. Villiers, has taken me by the hand in the most generous 
manner and has afforded me the most effectual assistance.       He has 
spoken to all the Ministers, collectively and individually, and has 
recommended the granting of my petition in the strongest manner, pointing 
out the terrible condition of the people at present who are without 
religious instruction of any kind, and the impossibility of exercising any 
species of government over a nation of atheists, which the Spaniards will 
very shortly become if left to themselves.       Whether moved by his 
arguments or by a wish to oblige a person of so much importance as the 
British Ambassador, the Cabinet of Madrid now exhibit a manifest 
willingness to do all in their power to satisfy me; and though by the law 
of Spain the publishing of the Scripture in the vulgar tongue without notes
is forbidden, measures have been taken by which the rigor of the law can be
eluded and the printer be protected, until such time as it shall be deemed 
prudent to repeal the law made, as is now generally confessed, in a time of
ignorance and superstitious darkness.
I herewith send you a letter which I received some days since from Mr. 
Villiers; I have several others on the same subject, but I prefer sending 
this particular one as it is the last.       Since I received it, the 
Ministers have met and discussed the petition, and the result was, as I 
have been informed, though not officially, in its favour.
You would oblige me by mentioning to his Lordship the President of the 
Bible Society the manner in which Mr. Villiers has befriended me, and to 
beg that he would express by letter an acknowledgment of the favour which I
have received; and at the same time, I think that a vote of thanks from the
Committee would not be amiss, as I may be again in need of Mr. V.       s 
assistance before I leave Spain.       The interest which he has taken in 
this affair is the more surprising, as Mr. Graydon informed me that upon 
his applying to him he declined to interfere.
I saw Mr. Graydon twice or thrice.       He left Madrid for Barcelona 
about a month since, because the heat of the former place in the summer 
months is more than he can bear, and as he found I was so far advanced, he 
thought he might be of more utility in Catalonia.
I have at present nothing more to say, and am so weak from heat and 
fatigue that I can hardly hold the pen.       I have removed from my old 
lodgings to those which Mr. Graydon occupied; therefore when you write, 
direct as above.       With my best remembrances to Mr. Jowett, I remain, 
my dear Sir, very truly yours,
G. B.

Revd. and dear Sir,       The affair is 
settled       thank God!!! and we may begin to print whenever we think 
proper.
Perhaps you have thought I have been tardy in accomplishing the business
which brought me to Spain; but to be able to form a correct judgment you 
ought to be aware of all the difficulties which I have had to encounter, 
and which I shall not enumerate; I shall content myself with observing that
for a thousand pounds I would not undergo again all the mortifications and 
disappointments of the last two months.
The present Ministry have been afraid to offend the clergy, and with 
great reason, as they are not of the movement or radical party, and many of
their friends are bigoted papists; nevertheless, influenced by the pressing
applications of the British Ambassador and being moreover well-disposed to 
myself, they have consented to the printing of the Testament; but it must 
be done in a private manner.       I have just had a long interview with 
Mr. Isturitz, who told me that if we were resolved upon the enterprise we 
had best employ the confidential printer of the Government, who would keep 
the matter secret; as in the present state of affairs he would not answer 
for the consequences if it were noised abroad.       I of course expressed 
my perfect readiness to comply with so reasonable a request.
I will now candidly confess to you that I do not think that the present 
Ministry, or, as it is generally called, the Court Ministry, will be able 
to stand its ground; nevertheless a change of Ministry would not alter the 
aspect of our affair in the least, for if the other or movement party come 
in, the liberty of the press (a great misfortune for Spain) would be 
probably granted; at all events, the influence of the English Ambassador 
would be greater than it is even at present, and upon his assistance I may 
rely at all times and occasions.
I am not aware that there is any great necessity for my continuance in 
Spain; nevertheless, should you think there is, you have only to 
command.       But I cannot help thinking that in a month or two when the 
heats are over Mr. Graydon might return, as nothing very difficult remains 
to be accomplished, and I am sure that Mr. Villiers at my entreaty would 
extend to him the patronage with which he has honoured me.       But, as I 
before observed, I am ready to do whatever the Bible Society may deem 
expedient.
Do not forget the two letters of thanks to the Ambassador, and it
would not be unwise to transmit a vote of thanks to        His 
Excellence Antonio Alcal         Galiano, President of Marine,        who 
has been of great assistance to me.
I have the honour to be, Revd. and dear Sir, your most obedient 
servant,
G. B.
P.S.       In about six weeks I shall want some more money.
My best remembrances to Mr. Jowett.

Madrid, July 19th, 1836.
Revd. and dear Sir,       As I believe you 
have no account of my proceedings at Badajoz, I send you the following 
which will perhaps serve for your        Monthly Extracts.              I 
have corrected and improved my translation of the Lord       s Prayer into 
Rommany, and should it be printed, let it be done so with care.       
Perhaps in a few days I shall send a general account of what I have been 
about since my arrival at Madrid, but I am at present very feeble and 
languid, and can scarcely hold a pen.       There is nothing new here, all 
is quiet, and I hope will continue so.       My time does not pass very 
agreeably, I am without books or conversation, for all my acquaintance have
left the place to escape from the intolerable heat.       I often sigh for 
Russia, and wish I was there, editing Mandchou or Armenian; pray remember 
me kindly to Mr. Jowett and to my other friends.       I remain, etc.
G. Borrow.
About one o       clock in the afternoon of the 6th of January, 1836, I 
crossed the bridge of the Guadiana, a boundary river between Portugal and 
Spain, and entered Badajoz, a strong Spanish town containing about 8000 
inhabitants, and founded by the Romans.       I instantly returned thanks 
to God who had protected me during a journey of five days through the wilds
of Alemtejo, the province of Portugal the most infested by robbers and 
desperate characters, and which I had traversed with no other human 
companion than a lad, nearly idiotic, who was to convey back the mules 
which carried myself and baggage.       It was not my intention to make 
much stay at Badajoz, and as a vehicle would set out for Madrid the day 
next but one after my arrival, I proposed to depart therein for the capital
of Spain.
The next morning I was standing at the door of the inn where I had taken
up my residence; the weather was gloomy, and rain seemed to be at 
hand.       I was thinking of the state of the country I had lately 
entered, which was involved in bloody anarchy and confusion, and where the 
ministers of a religion, falsely styled Catholic and Christian, were 
blowing the trump of war, instead of preaching the love-engendering words 
of the blessed Gospel.       Suddenly two men wrapped in long cloaks came 
down the narrow and almost deserted street.       They were about to pass 
me, and the face of the nearest was turned full towards me.       I knew to
whom the countenance which he displayed must belong, and I touched him on 
the shoulder.       The man stopped and his companion also; I said a 
certain word, to which after an exclamation of surprise he responded in the
manner which I expected.       The men were of that singular family, or 
race, which has diffused itself over every part of the civilized globe, and
the members of which are known as Gypsies, Bohemians, Gitanos, Zigani, and 
by many other names, but whose proper appellation seems to be 
       Rommany,        from the circumstance that in many and distant 
countries they so style themselves, and also the language which they speak 
amongst each other.       We began conversing in the Spanish dialect of 
this language, with which I was tolerably well acquainted.       Upon 
inquiring of my two newly-made acquaintances whether there were many of 
their people at Badajoz and in the vicinity, they informed me that there 
were nine or ten families residing in the town, and that there were others 
at Merida, a town about nine leagues distant.       I asked by what means 
they supported themselves, and they replied that they and their brethren 
gained a livelihood by jobbing in horses, mules, etc., but that all those 
in Badajoz were very poor, with the exception of one man, who was 
exceedingly mubalballo or rich, as he was in possession of many 
horses and other beasts.       They removed their cloaks for a moment, and 
I saw that their undergarments were rags.
They left me in haste, and went about the town informing the rest that a
stranger was arrived, who spoke Rommany as well as themselves, who had the 
eyes and face of a Gitano, and seemed to be of the eratti, or 
blood.       In less than half-an-hour the street before the inn was filled
with the men, women, and children of Egypt.       I went out amongst them, 
and my heart sank within me as I surveyed them; so much squalidness, dirt, 
and misery I had never before seen amongst a similar number of human 
beings.       But the worst of all was the evil expression of their 
countenances, plainly denoting that they were familiar with every species 
of crime; and it was not long before I found that their countenances did 
not belie them.       After they had asked me an infinity of questions, and
felt my hands, face, and clothes, they retired to their homes.       My 
meeting with these wretched people was the reason of my remaining at 
Badajoz a much longer time than I originally intended.       I wished to 
become better acquainted with their condition and manners, and above all to
speak to them about Christ and His Word, for I was convinced that should I 
travel to the end of the universe I should meet with none who were more in 
need of Christian exhortation, and I accordingly continued at Badajoz for 
nearly three weeks.
During this time I was almost constantly amongst them, and as I spoke 
their language and was considered by them as one of themselves, I had 
better opportunities of coming to a fair conclusion respecting their 
character than any other person, whether Spaniard or foreigner, could have 
hoped for, not possessed of a similar advantage.       The result of my 
observations was a firm belief that the Spanish Gitanos are the most vile, 
degraded, and wretched people upon the earth.
In no part of the world does the Gypsy race enjoy a fair fame and 
reputation, there being no part where they are not considered, and I 
believe with justice, as cheats and swindlers; but those of Spain are not 
only all this, but far more.       The Gypsies of England, Russia, etc., 
live by fraud of various descriptions, but they seldom commit acts of 
violence, and their vices are none or very few; the men are not drunkards, 
nor are the women harlots; but the Gypsy of Spain is a cheat in the 
market-place, a brigand and murderer on the high-road, and a drunkard in 
the wine-shop, and his wife is a harlot and thief on all times and 
occasions.       The excessive wickedness of these outcasts may perhaps be 
attributed to their having abandoned their wandering life and become 
inmates of the towns, where to the original bad traits of their character 
they have super-added the evil and vicious habits of the rabble.       
Their mouths teem with abomination, and in no part of the world have I 
heard such frequent, frightful, and extraordinary cursing as amongst 
them.
Religion they have none; they never attend mass, nor confess themselves,
and never employ the names of God, Christ and the Virgin, but in 
imprecation and blasphemy.       From what I learnt from them it appeared 
that their ancestors had some belief in metempsychosis, but they themselves
laughed at the idea, and were decidedly of opinion that the soul perished 
when the body ceased to breathe; and the argument which they used was 
rational enough, so far as it impugned metempsychosis:        We have been 
wicked and miserable enough in this life,        they said;        why 
should we live again?       
I translated certain portions of Scripture into their dialect, which I 
frequently read to them, especially the parables of Lazarus and the 
Prodigal Son, and told them that the latter had been as wicked as 
themselves, and both had suffered as much or more; but that the sufferings 
of the former, who always looked forward to a blessed resurrection, were 
recompensed in the world to come by admission to the society of Abraham and
the prophets, and that the latter, when he repented of his crimes, was 
forgiven and received into as much favour as the just son had always 
enjoyed.       They listened with admiration, but alas! not of the truths, 
the eternal truths I was telling them, but at finding that their broken 
jargon could be written and read.       The only words of assent to the 
heavenly doctrine which I ever obtained, and which were rather of the 
negative kind, were the following, from a woman:        Brother, you tell 
us strange things, though perhaps you do not lie; a month since I would 
sooner have believed these tales, than that I should this day have seen one
who could write Rommany.       
They possess a vast number of songs or couplets which they recite to the
music of the guitar.       For the purpose of improving myself in the 
language I collected and wrote down upwards of one hundred of these 
couplets, the subjects of which are horse-stealing, murder, and the various
incidents of gypsy-life in Spain.       Perhaps a collection of songs more 
characteristic of the people from whom they originated was never made, 
though amongst them are to be found some tender and beautiful thoughts, 
though few and far between, as a flower or shrub is here and there seen 
springing from the interstices of the rugged and frightful rocks of which 
are composed the mountains and sierras of Spain.
The following is their traditionary account of the expulsion of their 
fathers from Egypt.              And it came to pass that Pharaoh the King 
collected numerous armies for the purpose of war; and after he had 
conquered the whole world, he challenged God to descend from heaven and 
fight him; but the Lord replied,        There is no one who shall fight 
with Me       ; and thereupon the Lord opened a mountain, and He cast 
therein Pharaoh the King and all his numerous armies; so that the Egyptians
remained without defence, and their enemies arose and scattered them wide 
abroad.       
To the Rev. A. Brandram
No. 16 Calle de 
Santiago, Madrid,
July 25th, 1836.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I enclose you a 
letter from a Spanish gentleman who wishes to become a subscriber to the 
Society.       He is a person of great respectability, great learning, and 
is likewise one of the editors of the Espa        ol, the principal 
newspaper in Spain.       Should you accept his offer of becoming a 
correspondent, he may be of infinite service, as the newspaper which he 
superintends would be always open to the purposes of the Society.       He 
has connections all over Spain, and no one could assist more effectually in
diffusing the Scriptures when printed.       He wishes very much to have an
account of the proceedings of the Society, therefore any books you could 
send him relating thereto would be highly acceptable.       Great things 
might be done in Spain, and I am convinced that if there was a Protestant 
church in Madrid it would be crammed.
I have spoken to Mr. Wood, an Englishman, the printer of the 
Espa        ol, who has the best printing presses in Spain, and he 
is willing to begin the work whenever you think proper: he will engage to 
bring it out in three months, in the same shape as the Catalan 
Testaments.       In order that you may have as little trouble as possible,
I have translated Dr. Usoz       s letter.       I have not thought fit to 
transmit the printed paper which he alludes to, as it would make this 
letter very bulky.       It is an official account of his studies, and the 
honours he attained at the University.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir,
Most truly yours,
G. Borrow.
TRANSLATION OF DR. USOZ       S LETTER.
Gentlemen of the British and Foreign Bible Society,
Having by good fortune become acquainted with your Agent, Mr. G. Borrow,
at present residing in this city, and having learnt from him that I might 
take the liberty of addressing myself to you for the purpose of inquiring 
whether you would have any objection to insert my name in your list as a 
member, I avail myself of the present opportunity to do so, and hope that 
my wishes will be gratified.       I believe it is necessary for every 
member to pay        1 sterling, or 100 reals of our coin, annually;
perhaps you will inform me when, and in whose hands, I may deposit this 
sum.       As I have no other object in this than to endeavour, by all the 
means in my power, to cause the Scriptures to be read as much as possible 
in my unhappy country, I should wish to be considered in the light of a 
correspondent, as I flatter myself that if you would consent, after taking 
the necessary precautions, to entrust me with copies of the Scripture, I 
should find no difficulty in circulating them in every province of my 
country.
Being fully convinced that nothing but the reading of the Bible can form
the basis of solid liberty in Spain, I will employ every effort to promote 
it, if your philanthropic Society will assist me.       It would answer no 
purpose to occupy your attention by speaking prolixly of the purity of my 
intention and my zeal; time and experience will speak either for or against
me; I will merely enclose this printed paper, by which you will learn who 
he is who has taken the liberty of writing to you.       It is superfluous 
to add that, should you consent to my desire, I should want all the notices
and documents respecting your Society which you could supply me with.
As I possess some knowledge of English, you might avail yourselves of 
this language in your answer, provided the letters used be written 
clearly.
I have the honour, etc.
Luis De Usoz y 
Rio.
P.S.       Should you direct to me directly, or by other means than the 
post, my address is: A D. Luis de Usoz y Rio, Calle de Santa Catalina, No. 
12 nuevo, Madrid.
To J. Jackson, Esq.

Madrid, Aug. 10, 1836.
My dear Sir,       I have received your two 
letters containing the        50 and the resolution of the Society; I have 
likewise received Mr. Brandram       s.
I shall make the provisional engagement [to print] as desired, and shall
leave Madrid as soon as possible; but I must here inform you that I shall 
find much difficulty in returning to England, as all the provinces are 
disturbed in consequence of the Constitution of 1812 having been 
proclaimed, and the roads are swarming with robbers and banditti.       It 
is my intention to join some muleteers and attempt to reach Granada, from 
whence, if possible, I shall proceed to Malaga or Gibraltar, and thence to 
Lisbon, where I left the greatest part of my baggage.       Do not be 
surprised therefore, if I am tardy in making my appearance.       It is no 
easy thing at present to travel in Spain.       But all these troubles are 
for the benefit of the Cause, and must not be repined at.
I remain, my dear Sir, most truly yours,

Report of Mr. Geo. Borrow       s late Proceedings in Spain
London, 
October 17, 1836.
On the 16th of January I quitted Badajoz, a Spanish town on the frontier
of Portugal, for Madrid, whither I arrived in safety.       As my principal
motive for visiting the Spanish capital was the hope of obtaining 
permission from the Government to print the New Testament in the Castilian 
language in Spain, I lost no time upon my arrival in taking what I 
considered to be the necessary steps.       I must here premise that I was 
an entire stranger at Madrid, and that I bore no letters, of introduction 
to any person of influence whose credit might have assisted me in this 
undertaking; so that notwithstanding I entertained a hope of success, 
relying on the assistance of the Almighty, this hope was not at all times 
very vivid, but was frequently overcast with the clouds of 
despondency.       Mr. Mendizabal was at this time Prime Minister of Spain,
and was considered as a man of almost unbounded power, in whose hands were 
placed the destinies of the country.       I therefore considered that if I
could by any means induce him to favour my view I should have no reason to 
fear interruption from other quarters, and I determined upon applying to 
him; but though I essayed two or three times to obtain an interview with 
him, I failed, as he was far too much engrossed in important business to 
receive a humble and unknown stranger.       In this dilemma I bethought me
of waiting upon Mr. Villiers, the British Ambassador at Madrid, and craving
with the freedom permitted to a British subject his advice and assistance 
in this most interesting affair.       I was received by him with great 
kindness, and enjoyed a conversation with him on various subjects, before I
introduced the matter which I had most at heart.       He said that if I 
wished for an interview with Mr. M. he would endeavour to procure me one; 
but at the same time told me frankly that he could not hope that any good 
would arise from it, as Mr. M. was violently prejudiced against the British
and Foreign Bible Society, and was far more likely to discountenance than 
encourage any efforts which they might be disposed to make for introducing 
the Gospel into Spain.       I however remained resolute in my desire to 
make the trial, and before I left him obtained a letter of introduction to 
Mr. Mendizabal, with whom I had an interview a few days after.       The 
particulars of this interview have been detailed on a former 
occasion.       It will be sufficient to state here that I obtained from 
Mr. Mendizabal, if not immediate permission to print the Scriptures, a 
promise that at the expiration of a few months, when he hoped that the 
country would be in a more tranquil state, I should be at full liberty to 
do so, with which promise I departed well satisfied, and full of gratitude 
to the Lord, who seemed to have so wonderfully smoothed my way in an 
enterprise which at first sight seemed particularly arduous and 
difficult.
Before three months had elapsed Mr. Mendizabal had ceased to be Prime 
Minister; with his successor, Mr. Isturitz, I had become acquainted, and 
also with his colleagues, Galiano and the Duke de Rivas, and it was not 
long before I obtained       not however without much solicitation and 
difficulty       the permission which I so ardently desired.       Before, 
however, I could turn it to my account, the revolution broke out in Spain, 
and the press became free.
The present appears to be a moment peculiarly well adapted for 
commencing operations in Spain, the aim and view of which should be the 
introducing into that singularly unhappy portion of the world the knowledge
of the Saviour.       The clouds of bigotry and superstition which for so 
many centuries cast their dreary shadow upon Spain, are to a considerable 
degree dispelled, and there is little reason for supposing that they will 
ever again conglomerate.       The Papal See is no longer regarded with 
reverence, and its agents and ministers have incurred universal scorn and 
odium; therefore any fierce and determined resistance to the Gospel in 
Spain is not to be apprehended either from the people themselves, or from 
the clergy, who are well aware of their own weakness.       It is scarcely 
necessary to remark that every country which has been long subjected to the
sway of popery is in a state of great and deplorable ignorance.       
Spain, as might have been expected, has not escaped this common fate, and 
the greatest obstacle to the diffusion of the Gospel light amongst the 
Spaniards would proceed from the great want of education amongst 
them.       Perhaps there are no people in the world to whom nature has 
been, as far as regards mental endowments, more bounteously liberal than 
the Spaniards.       They are generally acute and intelligent to an 
extraordinary degree, and express themselves with clearness, fluency, and 
elegance upon all subjects which are within the scope of their 
knowledge.       It may indeed be said of the mind of a Spaniard, as of his
country, that it merely requires cultivation to be a garden of the first 
order; but, unhappily, both, up to the present time, have been turned to 
the least possible account.       Few amongst the lower class of the 
population of the towns are acquainted with letters, and fewer still 
amongst the peasantry; but though compelled to acknowledge the ignorance of
the Spaniards in general, I have great pleasure in being able to state that
during the latter years it has been becoming less and less, and that the 
rising generation is by no means so illiterate as the last, which was 
itself superior in acquirements to the preceding one.       It is to be 
hoped that the progress in improvement will still continue, and that within
a few years the blessings of education will be as generally diffused 
amongst the Spaniards as amongst the people of France and England.       
Government has already commenced the establishment of Normal Schools, and 
though the state of the country, convulsed with the horrors of civil war, 
precludes the possibility of devoting to them the care and attention which 
they deserve, I have no doubt that when it shall please the Lord to 
vouchsafe peace unto Spain they will receive all the requisite patronage 
and support, as their utility is already generally recognised.
Before quitting Madrid I entered into negotiation with Mr. Charles Wood,
a respectable Englishman established there, for the printing of 5000 copies
of the New Testament in Spanish, which number, if on good paper and in 
handsome type, I have little doubt might be easily disposed of within a 
short time in the capital and in the principal provincial towns of Spain, 
particularly Cadiz and Seville, where the people are more enlightened than 
in other parts in most respects, and where many would be happy to obtain 
the sacred volume in a handsome yet cheap form, and some in any shape 
whatever       as there the Word of God is at least known by reputation, 
and no small curiosity has of late years been manifested concerning it, 
though unfortunately that curiosity has not hitherto been gratified, for 
reasons too well known to require recapitulation.
In the rural districts the chances of the Scriptures are considerably 
less, for there, as far as I am aware, not only no curiosity has been 
excited respecting it, but it is not known by name, and when mentioned to 
the people, is considered to be nothing more or less than the mass-book of 
the Romish Church.       On various occasions I have conversed with the 
peasantry of Estremadura, La Mancha, and Andalusia respecting the holy 
Book, and without one exception they were not only ignorant of its 
contents, but ignorant of its nature; some who could read, and pretended to
be acquainted with it, said that it contained hymns to the Virgin, and was 
written by the Pope; yet the peasantry of these three provinces are by no 
means the least enlightened of Spain, but perhaps the reverse.       In a 
word, great as the ignorance of the generality of the Spaniards upon most 
essential points is, they are principally ignorant of the one most 
essential of all, the religion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
No time, however, ought to be lost in supplying those with the word who 
are capable of receiving it; though millions in Spain are undoubtedly 
beyond the reach of any efforts which the Bible Society can make to assist 
them, however much it may have at heart their eternal salvation, it is 
gratifying to have grounds for belief that thousands are able and willing 
to profit by the exertions which may be made to serve them.       Though 
the days of the general orange-gathering are not arrived, when the tree 
requires but a slight shaking to scatter its ripe and glorious treasures on
the head of the gardener, still goodly and golden fruit is to be gathered 
on the most favoured and sunny branches; the quantity is small in 
comparison with what remains green and acid, but there is enough to repay 
the labour of him who is willing to ascend to cull it; the time of the 
grand and general harvesting is approaching, perhaps it will please the 
Almighty to hasten it; and it may even now be nearer than the most sanguine
of us dares to hope.
G. Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Nov. 30th, 1836)
Lisbon, Novr. 15th, 1836.
Revd. and dear Sir,       On taking leave of 
you I promised to write from Cadiz, and I still hope to perform my promise;
but as I am apprehensive that several days will elapse before I shall reach
that place I avail myself of the present opportunity of informing you that 
I am alive and well, lest you should become uneasy at not hearing from me 
at the time you expected.       It is owing to the mercy of God that, 
instead of being able to pen these lines, I am not at the present moment 
floundering in the brine, a prey to the fishes and monsters of the 
ocean.
We had a most unpleasant passage to Falmouth.       The ship was crowded
with passengers, most of whom were poor consumptive individuals and other 
invalids, fleeing from the cold blasts of England       s winter to the 
sunny shores of Portugal and Madeira.       In a more uncomfortable vessel,
especially steam-ship, it has never been my fate to make a voyage; the 
berths were small and insupportably close, and of the wretched holes mine 
was amongst the worst, the rest having been for the most part bespoken 
before I arrived on board, so that to avoid the suffocation which seemed to
threaten me I lay upon the floor of one of the cabins, and continued to do 
so until my arrival here.       We remained at Falmouth twenty-four hours, 
taking in coals and repairing the engine, which had sustained considerable 
damage.
On Monday the 7th inst. we again started and made for the Bay of Biscay;
the sea was high and the wind strong and contrary, nevertheless on the 
morning of the fourth day we were in sight of the rocky coast to the north 
of Cape Finisterre.       I must here observe that this was the first 
voyage that the captain who commanded the vessel had ever made on board of 
her, and that he knew little or nothing about the coast towards which we 
were bearing; he was a person picked up in a hurry, the former captain 
having resigned his command on the ground that the ship was not sea-worthy,
and that the engines were frequently unserviceable.       I was not 
acquainted with these circumstances at the time, or perhaps I should have 
felt more alarmed than I did when I saw the vessel approaching nearer and 
nearer to the shore, till at last we were only a few hundred yards 
distant.       As it was, however, I felt very much surprised, for having 
passed it twice before, both times in steam-vessels, and having seen with 
what care the captains endeavoured to maintain a wide offing, I could not 
conceive the reason of our being now so near the dangerous region.       
The wind was blowing hard towards the shore, if that can be called a shore 
which consists of steep abrupt precipices, on which the surf was breaking 
with the noise of thunder, tossing up clouds of spray and foam to the 
height of a cathedral.       We coasted slowly along, rounding several tall
forelands, some of them piled up by the hand of nature in the most 
fantastic shapes, until about the fall of night.       Cape Finisterre was 
not far ahead, a bluff brown granite mountain, whose frowning head may be 
seen far away by those who travel the ocean.       The stream which poured 
round its breast was terrific, and though our engines plied with all their 
force, we made little or no way.
By about eight o       clock at night, the wind had increased to a 
hurricane, the thunder rolled frightfully, and the only light which we had 
to guide us on our way was the red forked lightning which burst at times 
from the bosom of the big black clouds which lowered over our heads.       
We were exerting ourselves to the utmost to weather the cape, which we 
could descry by the lightning on our lee, its brow being frequently 
brilliantly lighted up by the flashes which quivered around it, when 
suddenly, with a great crash, the engine broke, and the paddles on which 
depended our lives ceased to play.
I will not attempt to depict the scene of horror and confusion which 
ensued: it may be imagined, but never described.       The captain, to give
him his due, displayed the utmost coolness and intrepidity, and he and the 
whole crew made the greatest exertions to repair the engine, and when they 
found their labour in vain, endeavoured by hoisting the sails and by 
practising all possible manoeuvres to preserve the ship from impending 
destruction.       But all was of no use; we were hard on a lee shore, to 
which the howling tempest was impelling us.       About this time I was 
standing near the helm, and I asked the steersman if there was any hope of 
saving the vessel or our lives; he replied,        Sir, it is a bad affair;
no boat could for a minute live in this sea, and in less than an hour the 
ship will have her broadside on Finisterre, where the strongest man-of-war 
ever built must go to shivers instantly.       None of us will see the 
morning.              The captain likewise informed the other passengers in
the cabin to the same effect, telling them to prepare themselves, and 
having done so he ordered the door to be fastened, and none to be permitted
to come on deck.       I, however, kept my station, though almost drowned 
with water, immense waves continually breaking over our windward side and 
flooding the ship; the water-casks broke from their lashings, and one of 
them struck me down, and crushed the foot of the unfortunate man at the 
helm, whose place was instantly taken by the captain.       We were now 
close on the rocks, when a horrid convulsion of the elements took place; 
the lightning enveloped us as with a mantle, the thunders were louder than 
the roar of a million cannon, the dregs of the ocean seemed to be cast up, 
and in the midst of all this turmoil the wind, without the slightest 
intimation veered right about, and pushed us from the horrible coast
faster than it had previously drawn us towards it.
The oldest sailors on board acknowledged that they had never witnessed 
so providential an escape.       I said from the bottom of my heart, 
       Our Father: hallowed be Thy name.              The next day we were 
near foundering, for the sea was exceedingly high, and our vessel, which 
was not intended for sailing, laboured terribly, and leaked much.       The
pumps were continually working.       She likewise took fire, but the 
flames were extinguished.       In the evening the steam-engine was 
partially repaired, and we reached Lisbon on the 13th.       Most of my 
clothes and other things are spoiled, for the hold was overflowed with the 
water from the boiler and the leak.
The vessel will be ready for sea in about a week, when I shall depart 
for Cadiz; but most of the passengers who intended going farther than 
Lisbon have abandoned her, as they say she is doomed.       But I have more
trust in the Lord that governeth the winds, and in whose hands the seas are
as a drop.       He who preserved us at Finisterre can preserve elsewhere, 
and if it be His will that we perish, the firm ground is not more secure 
than the heaving sea.
I have seen our excellent friend Mr. Wilby, and delivered to him the 
parcel, with which I was entrusted.       He has been doing everything in 
his power to further the sale of the sacred volume in Portuguese; indeed 
his zeal and devotedness are quite admirable, and the Society can never 
appreciate his efforts too highly.       But since I was last at Lisbon the
distracted state of the country has been a great obstacle to him; 
people       s minds are so engrossed with politics that they find no time 
to think of their souls.       Before this reaches you, you will doubtless 
have heard of the late affair at Belem, where poor Freire (I knew him well)
one of the ex-Ministers lost his life, and which nearly ended in an affray 
between the English forces and the native.       The opinions of the 
Portuguese seem to be decidedly democratic, and I have little doubt that 
were the English squadron withdrawn the unfortunate young Queen would lose 
her crown within a month, and be compelled with her no less unfortunate 
young husband to seek a refuge in another country.       I repeat that I 
hope to write to you from Cadiz; I shall probably be soon in the allotted 
field of my labours, distracted, miserable Spain.       The news from 
thence is at present particularly dismal; the ferocious Gomez, after having
made an excursion into Estremadura, which he ravaged like a pestilence, has
returned to Andalusia, the whole of which immense province seems to be 
prone at his feet.       I shall probably find Seville occupied by his 
hordes, but I fear them not, and trust that the Lord will open the path for
me to Madrid.       One thing I am resolved upon: either to be the 
instrument of doing something for Spain, or never to appear again in my 
native land.

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Dec. 28th, 1836)
Seville, Dec. 5th, 1836.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I arrived safely at
Cadiz on the 21st ult.; the steam-engine had been partially repaired at 
Lisbon, and our passage was speedy and prosperous.       I was happy to 
have reached the shores of Spain, being eager to enter upon my allotted 
task.       Cadiz is a small but beautiful city, built upon a tongue of 
land and surrounded on all points but one by the sea, which dashes up 
against its walls: the houses are lofty, and of a dazzling whiteness; the 
streets are straight and narrow.       On my arrival I found great 
confusion reigning: numerous bands of the factious were reported to be 
hovering in the neighbourhood, an attack was not deemed improbable, and the
place had just been declared in a state of siege.       I took up my abode 
at the French Hotel, in the Calle de la Niveria, and was allotted a species
of cock-loft or garret to sleep in, for the house was filled with guests, 
being a place of much resort on account of the excellent table 
d       h       te which is kept there.       I dressed myself and 
walked about the town.       I entered several coffee houses: the din of 
tongues in all was deafening; in one no less than six orators were 
haranguing at the same time on the state of the country, and the 
probability of an intervention on the part of England and France.       As 
I was listening to one of them he suddenly called upon me for my opinion, 
as I was a foreigner, and seemingly just arrived.       I replied that I 
could not venture to guess what steps the two Governments would pursue 
under the present circumstances, but thought that it would be as well if 
the Spaniards would exert themselves more, and call less on Jupiter.       
As I did not wish to engage in any political conversation I instantly 
quitted the house, and sought those parts of the town where the lower 
classes principally reside.
I entered into discourse with several individuals, but found them very 
ignorant; none could write or read, and their ideas respecting religion 
were anything but satisfactory, most professing a perfect 
indifference.       I afterwards went into a bookseller       s shop, and 
made enquiries respecting the demand for literature, which he informed me 
was small.       I produced our 24mo edition of the New Testament in 
Spanish, and asked the bookseller whether he thought a book of that 
description would sell in Cadiz.       He said it was exceedingly 
beautiful, both in type and paper, but it was a work not sought after, and 
very little known.       I did not pursue my enquiries in other shops, for 
I reflected that I was not very likely to receive a very favourable opinion
from booksellers respecting a publication in which they had no 
interest.       I had, moreover, but two or three copies of the New 
Testament with me, and could not have supplied them had they given me an 
order.
That night I became very unwell, and was apprehending that I had been 
seized with the cholera, as the symptoms of my complaint were very similar 
to those which accompany that disorder.       I was for some time in most 
acute pain, and terribly sick; I drank oil mixed with brandy, and in some 
degree recovered, and for the two succeeding days was very feeble, and able
to undertake nothing.       This attack was the cause of my not writing to 
you from Cadiz as I had fully intended.
Early on the 24th I embarked for Seville in the small Spanish steamer 
the Betis.       The morning was wet, and the aspect of nature was 
enveloped in a dense mist, which prevented my observing surrounding 
objects.       After proceeding about six leagues, we reached the 
north-eastern extremity of the bay of Cadiz, and passed by Saint Lucar, an 
ancient town close by where the Guadalquivir disembogues itself.       The 
mist suddenly disappeared, and the sun of Spain burst forth in full 
brilliancy, enlivening all around, and particularly myself, who had till 
then been lying on the deck in a dull melancholy stupor.       We entered 
the mouth of the        Great River,        for that is the English 
translation of Qued al Kiber, as the Moors designated the ancient 
Betis.       We came to anchor for a few minutes at a little village called
Bonan        a, at the extremity of the first reach of the river, where we 
received several passengers, and again proceeded.       There is not much 
in the appearance of the Guadalquivir to interest the traveller: the banks 
are low and destitute of trees, the adjacent country is flat, and only in 
the distance is seen a range of tall blue sierras.       The water is 
turbid and muddy, and in colour closely resembling the contents of a 
duck-pool; the average width of the stream is from 150 to 200 yards.       
But it is impossible to move along this river without remembering that it 
has borne the Roman, the Vandal, and the Arab, and has been the witness of 
deeds which have resounded through the world, and been the themes of 
immortal song.       I repeated Latin verses and fragments of old Spanish 
ballads, till we reached Seville at about nine o       clock of a lovely 
moonlight night.
Before entering upon more important matter I will say a few words 
respecting Seville and its curiosities.       It contains 90,000 
inhabitants, and is situated on the left bank of the Guadalquivir, about 
eighteen leagues from its mouth.       It is surrounded with high Moorish 
walls, in a good state of preservation, and built of such durable materials
that it is probable they will for many centuries bid defiance to the 
encroachment of time.       The most remarkable edifices are the cathedral 
and Alcazar or palace of the Moorish kings.       The tower of the former, 
called La Giralda, belongs to the period of the Moors, and formed part of 
the Grand Mosque of Seville.       It is 220 ells in height, and is 
ascended not by stairs or ladders, but by a vaulted pathway, in the manner 
of an inclined plane; this path is by no means steep, so that a cavalier 
might ride up to the top, a feat which Ferdinand the Seventh is said to 
have accomplished.       The view from the summit is very extensive, and on
a fine clear day the ridge called the Sierra de Ronda may be discovered 
though the distance is upward of twenty-two leagues.       The cathedral 
itself is a noble Gothic structure, reputed the finest of the kind in 
Spain.       In the chapels allotted to the various saints are some of the 
most magnificent paintings which Spanish art has produced.       Here are 
to be seen the far-famed        Angel of the Guard,        by Murillo, his 
       Saint Anthony at Devotion,        the celestial spirits hovering 
around him, and Saint Thomas of Villa Nueva bestowing Charity       ; there
are also some pictures by Sob        ran [? Zurbaran] of almost inestimable
value.       Indeed, the cathedral at Seville is at the present time far 
more rich in splendid paintings than at any former period, possessing many 
very recently removed from some of the suppressed convents, particularly 
from the Capuchin and Franciscan.
No one should visit Seville without paying particular attention to the 
Alcazar.       It is perhaps the most perfect specimen of Moorish 
architecture which is at present to be found in Europe.       It contains 
many splendid halls, particularly that of the Ambassadors, so called, which
is in every respect more magnificent than the one of the same name within 
the Alhambra of Granada.       This palace was a favourite residence of 
Peter the Cruel, who carefully repaired it, without altering its Moorish 
character and appearance.       It probably remains in much the same state 
as at the time of his death.
On the right side of the river is a large suburb called Triana, 
communicating with Seville by means of a bridge of boats; for there is no 
permanent bridge across the Guadalquivir owing to the violent inundations 
to which it is subject.       This suburb is inhabited by the dregs of the 
populace, and abounds with Gitanos or Gypsies.       About a league and a 
half to the north-west stands the village of Santo Ponce; at the foot and 
on the side of some elevated ground higher up are to be seen vestiges of 
ruined walls and edifices which once formed part of Italica, the 
birth-place of Silius Italicus and Trajan, from which latter personage 
Triana derives its name.       One fine morning I walked thither, and 
having ascended the hill I directed my course northward.       I soon 
reached what had once been bagnios, and a little farther on, in a kind of 
valley between two gentle acclivities, the amphitheatre.       This latter 
object is by far the most considerable relic of ancient Italica; it is oval
in its form, with two gateways, fronting the east and west.       On all 
sides are to be seen the time-worn broken granite benches, from whence 
myriads of human beings once gazed down on the area below, where the 
gladiator shouted, and the lion and leopard yelled.       All around 
beneath these flights of benches are vaulted excavations, from whence the 
combatants, part human, part bestial, darted forth by their several 
doors.       I spent several hours in this singular place, forcing my way 
through the wild fennel and brushwood into the caverns, now the haunts of 
adders and other reptiles, whose hissings I heard.       Having sated my 
curiosity, I left the ruins, and returning by another way reached a place 
where lay the carcase of a horse half-devoured.       Upon it with lustrous
eyes stood an enormous vulture, who, as I approached, slowly soared aloft 
till he alighted on the eastern gate of the amphitheatre, from whence he 
uttered a hoarse cry, as if in anger that I had disturbed him from his 
feast of carrion.
And now for another subject.       You are doubtless anxious to know 
what are my projects, and why I am not by this time further advanced on my 
way to Madrid; know then that the way to Madrid is beset with more perils 
than harassed Christian in his route to the Eternal Kingdom.       Almost 
all communication is at an end between this place and the capital, the 
diligences and waggons have ceased running, even the bold arrieros 
or muleteers are at a stand-still; and the reason is that the rural portion
of Spain, especially this part, is in a state of complete disorganisation 
and of blackest horror.       The three fiends, famine, plunder, and 
murder, are playing their ghastly revels unchecked; bands of miscreants 
captained by such       what shall I call them?       as Orejita and 
Palillos, are prowling about in every direction, and woe to those whom they
meet.       A few days since they intercepted an unfortunate courier, and 
after scooping out his eyes put him to death with most painful tortures, 
and mangled his body in a way not to be mentioned.       Moreover, the 
peasantry, who have been repeatedly plundered by these fellows, and who 
have had their horses and cattle taken from them by the Carlists, being 
reduced with their families to nakedness and the extreme of hunger, seize 
in rage and desperation upon every booty which comes within their reach, a 
circumstance which can awaken but little surprise.
This terrible state of things, staring me in the face on my arrival at 
Seville, made me pause.       I thought that the tempest might in some 
degree subside, but hitherto I have been disappointed.       My mind is at 
present made up.       I shall depart for Madrid in two or three days, at 
all risks.       The distance is 300 miles.       I shall hire, in the 
first place, horses, and a guide, as far as Cordova (twenty-six 
leagues).       I shall have to pay a great price, it is true, but I have 
money, praised be God, who inspired me with the idea of putting fifty 
sovereigns in my pocket when I left London.       I should otherwise be 
helpless.       From Cordova I must endeavour to obtain horses to Val de 
Penas (twenty leagues), which is half way to Madrid.       Were I at Val de
Penas, I should feel comparatively at ease; for from thence I know the 
road, having traversed it in my ways from Madrid to Grenada; it moreover 
runs through La Mancha, which, though infested with banditti, is plain open
ground, and if I could obtain no guide or horses, or had been plundered of 
my money, I might hope to make my way on foot.       But I am ignorant of 
the country between Seville and Cordova, and from Cordova to Val de 
Penas.       The route is through the dismal and savage mountains of the 
Sierra Morena, where I should inevitably be bewildered, and perhaps, if not
murdered, fall a prey to the wolves.       Were the whole way known to me, 
I would leave my baggage here and dressed as a beggar or Gypsy set out on 
foot; strange as this plan may sound in English ears, it would be the 
safest course I could pursue.       Should I perish in this journey, keep 
the affair secret as long as possible from my dear mother, and when it 
should be necessary to reveal it to her, do me the favour to go to Norwich 
on purpose; should I reach Madrid, you will hear from me in about five 
weeks, from the time you receive this.       It would be of no utility to 
write to you from Cordova; the letter would never reach you, I hope this 
will.
Gomez had not hitherto paid a visit to Seville; when I arrived here, he 
was said to be in the neighbourhood of Ronda.       The city was under 
watch and ward, several gates had been blocked up with masonry, trenches 
dug, and redoubts erected, but I am convinced that the place would not have
held out six hours against a resolute assault.       Gomez has proved 
himself to be a most extraordinary man, and with his small army of 
Aragonese and Basques has within the last four months made the tour of 
Spain; he has very frequently been hemmed in with forces three times the 
number of his own, in places whence escape seemed impossible, but he has 
always baffled his enemies, whom he seems to laugh at.       The most 
absurd accounts of victories gained over him are continually issuing from 
the press at Seville; the other day it was stated that his army had been 
utterly defeated, himself killed, and that 1200 prisoners were on their way
to Seville.       I saw these prisoners; instead of 1200 desperadoes, they 
consisted of about twenty poor lame ragged wretches, many of them boys from
fourteen to sixteen years of age; they were evidently camp-followers, who, 
unable to keep up with the army, had been picked up straggling in the 
plains and amongst the hills.       It now appears that no battle had 
occurred, and that the death of Gomez was a fiction.       The grand defect
of Gomez is not knowing how to take advantage of circumstances; after his 
defeat of Lopez he might have marched to Madrid and proclaimed Don Carlos 
there, and after sacking Cordova, he might have captured Seville.
There are several booksellers        shops in Seville, in two of which I
found copies of the New Testament (our own 12mo edition of 1826); they had 
been obtained from Gibraltar about two years since, during which time six 
copies had been sold in one shop and four in the other.       I have become
acquainted with an elderly person, a Genoese by birth, who, should we 
succeed in bringing out an edition of the sacred volume at Madrid, may be 
of service to us, as a colporteur in this place and the neighbourhood, 
where he is well known.       He has assured me of his willingness to 
undertake the task, and, if required, to visit Cordova, Grenada, or any 
part of Andalusia, town or country; he has been accustomed to bookselling, 
and at one time he also brought some of our Testaments from Gibraltar, all 
of which were however taken from him by the Custom House officers with the 
exception of one copy, which he afterwards disposed of to a lady for 30 
reals (6s. 6d.).       Should the Bible Society be desirous to 
circulate the book in the rural districts of Spain, they must be prepared 
to make considerable sacrifices.       In some of the towns, especially the
sea-ports, it is probable that many copies may be disposed of, at a fair 
price; but can it be expected that amongst myriads, who are in want of the 
common necessaries of life, who are without food, fuel or clothing, and on 
whose wretched heads the horrors which civil war       and such a civil 
war       have principally fallen, [men] can have money for books?       I 
am willing to visit every part of Spain, and to risk my life a thousand 
times in laying God       s Word before the people, but I can promise no 
more.       I have no extraordinary powers, indeed scarcely those allotted 
to the average of humanity; God, it is true, can operate wonders by any 
instrument, but we must bide His will.
I have had the good fortune to form the acquaintance of Mr. Wetherell, 
an English gentleman, who has for many years been established in a very 
important branch of business at Seville.       He takes a warm interest in 
my mission, and has frequently informed me that nothing will afford him 
greater pleasure than to further the cause at this place and in the 
neighbourhood; as he employs a vast number of individuals, I have little 
doubt that he has the power, as he certainly has the will.       He is a 
virtuoso and possesses a singular collection of the ancient idols of 
Mexico, which bear a surprising resemblance to those used by the followers 
of the Buddhist superstition.       In return for a translation of an 
Arabic inscription which I made for him, he presented me with a copy of the
Cabalistic book Zohar, in the Rabbinical language and character, which on 
the destruction of the Inquisition at Seville (1820) he obtained from the 
library of that horrible tribunal.
Pray remember me to Mr. Jowett and Mr. Browne and my other 
friends.       May the Lord bless you, my dear Sir.

Revd. and dear Sir,       I am just arrived 
at Madrid in safety.       It has pleased the Lord to protect me through 
the perils of a most dismal journey.       I reached Cordova in three days,
attended by the old Italian whom I mentioned in my last letter, for I could
procure no other guide.       From Cordova I have ridden to Madrid in the 
company of a contrabandista, or smuggler, whose horses I insured, 
and to whom I am to give a gratuity of 42 dollars.       We passed through 
the horrible pass of Despena Perros in the Sierra Morena.       Providence 
here manifested itself; the day before, the banditti of the pass committed 
a dreadful robbery and murder by which they sacked 40,000 reals; 
they were probably content with their booty and did not interrupt me and my
guide.       We entered La Mancha, where I expected to fall into the hands 
of Palillos and Orejita.       Providence again showed itself.       It had
been delicious weather; suddenly the Lord breathed forth a frozen blast, 
the severity of which was almost intolerable; no human being but ourselves 
ventured forth; we traversed snow-covered plains and passed through 
villages and towns without seeing an individual; the robbers kept close in 
their caves and hovels, but the cold nearly killed me.       We reached 
Aranjuez late on Christmas day, and I got into the house of an Englishman, 
where I swallowed nearly two bottles of brandy; it affected me no more than
warm water.       I am now at my journey       s end, and shall presently 
fall to work, for I must lose no time, but profit by the present 
opportunity.       All is quiet in Madrid and in the neighbourhood; Gomez 
has returned to Biscay.       If my letter be somewhat incoherent, mind it 
not.       I have just alighted, and the cold has still the mastery of me; 
I shall send a journal in a few days which will be more 
circumstantial.       Write to my mother and say I am in safety.       I 
shall write myself to-morrow, I can no more now.

My dear Sir,       I forward the bill of my 
expenses from the moment of my quitting London up to the time of my arrival
at Madrid.       When it is considered that I have been nearly two months 
on this most perilous journey, it will probably not be deemed extravagant; 
should that however be the case, I shall be very willing to defray from my 
salary any deduction which may be made.       I beg leave to call your 
attention particularly to the expense of horse-hire.       I paid an ounce 
of gold for two miserable animals from Seville to Cordova, I had to 
maintain them by the way, to pay their expenses back, and to provide a 
guide.       Neither of the horses was worth what I paid for their hire; it
is true their master risked their being captured by the bands of robbers 
from whom I providentially escaped.       It will in future be much cheaper
to purchase horses.       You will oblige me by informing me how my account
with you stands, for it seems I was indebted to you on departing.       I 
have seen Mr. O       Shea and Mr. Wood; with the assistance of the former 
gentleman I hope to obtain the paper for the work at a considerable less 
price than that stated in Mr. W.       s estimate, as Mr. O       Shea is 
connected with the paper-mills of Catalonia.       I shall write to Mr. 
Brandram in a few days and in the meanwhile remain, etc.,

Jany. 14, 1837, Madrid.
Calle San Iago No. 16,  span 
class="smcap">piso 3ro.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Immediately on my 
arrival at Madrid, which occurred on the 26th of last month, I despatched 
letters to yourself and Mr. Tarn, in that to Mr. T. was enclosed an account
of my expenses, both of which letters I hope have arrived in safety.       
I now take up the pen to acquaint you with what I have done since my 
arrival, and what I, with the Lord       s assistance, purpose doing.
My first care was to wait on my excellent friend, Mr. Villiers, who 
received me with his usual kindness.       I asked him if it were his 
opinion that I might venture to commence printing the Scriptures without an
application to the present Government, as the law is doubtful on the 
point.       His reply was satisfactory:        You obtained the permission
of the Government of Isturitz,        said he,        which was a much less
liberal one than the present; I am a witness to the promise made to you by 
the former Ministers, which I consider sufficient; you had best commence 
and complete the work as soon as possible, without any fresh application, 
and should any one attempt to interrupt you, you have only to come to me, 
whom you may command at any time.              I went away with a light 
heart.
I next visited Mr. O       Shea, who was very glad to see me again, and 
assured me that he took the greatest interest in my undertaking, and should
be happy to further it to the utmost of his power.       I knew that he had
been connected with the paper-manufactories of the south, and a thought 
struck me.       You will remember that I brought over specimens of paper 
from thirty to eighty reals per ream, and that I was authorised to 
purchase 600  a href="#footnote197" 
class="citation">[197] reams of paper at 60 reals per 
ream.       I asked Mr. O       Shea if he did not think that, through his 
connections, he could procure me such paper as I wanted at a much cheaper 
rate than it was possible for me to obtain it; he said he would make 
enquiries.       I returned in a few days: he had performed more than I 
expected, and he showed me paper at 45 reals, better than what I 
could have purchased at 70, likewise some very good at 37.       I 
hesitated for some time between these two specimens; I at length, however, 
determined to purchase that at 45 reals.       I am therefore able 
to communicate that in paper alone 9000 reals will have been saved 
to the funds of the Society, and at the same time a superior article have 
been procured.
I found that during my absence from Madrid Mr. Wood had quitted Mr. 
Borrego, and had accepted a situation in another printing establishment; 
but as Mr. Borrego is in possession of the only English press at Madrid, is
moreover an intimate friend of Mr. O       Shea, and above all enjoys the 
good opinion of Mr. Villiers who interests himself in his welfare, I am 
determined to entrust the printing to him.       Mr. Borrego has agreed to 
make a reduction of 10 reals per sheet in his estimate, which I 
consider very liberal conduct, as the former charge, considering the rate 
of printing at Madrid, was by no means high.       We have resolved to 
print the work precisely the same in shape and size as the copy entrusted 
to my charge, except that we shall substitute single for double 
columns.
I shall look over each sheet of the work myself, but in order to bring 
out as correct an edition as possible I have engaged the literary 
assistance of Dr. Usoz, the gentleman who some time since addressed a 
letter to the Society, in which he expressed a wish to become a 
member.       He is one of the best Castilian scholars in Madrid, and, as 
he feels zeal in the cause, will, I have no doubt, prove eminently 
useful.       Any remuneration for his labour he will leave to the 
consideration of the Bible Society and myself.
We shall commence printing within a few days, and I expect to have the 
work ready within ten weeks.
Now permit me to propose a very important question to you.       What is
to be done with the volumes when the work shall have passed through the 
press?       As I am sure you will feel at a loss to give a satisfactory 
answer, allow me to propose the only plan which appears feasible.       
Believe me when I say that it is not the result of a few moments        
cogitation.       I have mused on it much and often.       I mused on it 
when off Cape Finisterre in the tempest, in the cut-throat passes of the 
Morena, and on the plains of La Mancha, as I jogged along a little way 
ahead of the smuggler.       It is this.
As soon as the work is printed and bound, I will ride forth from Madrid 
into the wildest parts of Spain, where the Word is most wanted, and where 
it seems next to an impossibility to introduce it.       I will go through 
the whole of the Asturias and Galicia, and along the entire line of the 
Pyrenees, not forgetting to visit every part of Biscay.       To accomplish
this I must have horses and a man to take care of them.       To purchase 
horses will be much more economical than to hire them, as the hire of an 
animal for a journey of only thirty leagues generally amounts to nearly its
full value; the purchase of three horses will not amount to more than 
       36, and a servant may be obtained for 9d. per day and his board.
I will take with me 1200 copies, which I will engage to dispose of, for 
little or much, to the wild people of the wild regions which I intend to 
visit.       As for the rest of the edition it must be disposed of, if 
possible, in a different way       I may say the usual way; part must be 
entrusted to booksellers, part to colporteurs, and a dep       t must be 
established at Madrid.       Such work is every person       s work, and to
any one may be confided the execution of it; it is a mere affair of 
trade.       What I wish to be employed in is what, I am well aware, no 
other individual will undertake to do: namely, to scatter the Word upon the
mountains, amongst the valleys and the inmost recesses of the worst and 
most dangerous parts of Spain, where the people are more fierce, fanatic 
and, in a word, Carlist,       parts where bookshops are unknown, and where
none of those means can be resorted to for the spread of the Bible which 
can be used in the more civilised portions of the kingdom.
This is the plan which I most humbly offer to the consideration of the 
Committee and yourself.       I shall not feel at all surprised should it 
be disapproved of altogether; but I wish it to be understood that in that 
event I could do nothing further than see the work through the press, as I 
am confident that whatever ardour and zeal I at present feel in the cause 
would desert me immediately, and that I should neither be able nor willing 
to execute anything which might be suggested.       I wish to engage in 
nothing which would not allow me to depend entirely on myself.       It 
would be heart-breaking to me to remain at Madrid, expending the 
Society       s money, with almost the certainty of being informed 
eventually by the booksellers and their correspondents that the work has no
sale.       In a word, to make sure that some copies find their way among 
the people I must be permitted to carry them to the people myself; and what
people have more need of Christian instruction than the inhabitants of the 
districts alluded to?
Ere the return of the contrabandista to Cordova, I purchased one 
of the horses which had brought us to Madrid.       It is an exceedingly 
strong, useful animal, and as I had seen what it is capable of performing, 
I gave him the price which he demanded (about        11, 17s.).       It 
will go twelve leagues a day with ease, and carry three hundred-weight on 
its back.       I am looking out for another, but shall of course make no 
further purchase until I hear from you.       I confess I would sooner 
provide myself with mules, but they are very expensive creatures.       In 
the first place, the original cost of a tolerable one amounts to        30;
and they, moreover, consume a vast quantity of fodder, at least two pecks 
of barley in the twenty-four hours with straw in proportion, and if they 
are stinted in their food they are of no manner of service; the attendance 
which they require is likewise very irksome, as they must be fed once every
four hours night and day; they are, however, noble animals, and are much in
vogue amongst the principal nobility.
Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly 
yours,
G. B.

(Endorsed: recd. Mar. 6, 1837)
Madrid, No. 16 Calle Sant. 
Iago,
Feby. 27, 1837.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have received 
your letter of the 27th ult. containing the resolution of the Committee, 
and also yours of the [17th] ult. with my account.       I was exceedingly 
grieved at learning that poor Mr. Tarn has been removed, for he was a most 
worthy person, and the Bible Society will experience a severe loss in his 
death; but I hope and trust that eventually some one will be found worthy 
to succeed him.       He is doubtless at present in the other world 
receiving the reward of his faith in this; let us pray that we may be 
counted worthy to join him there!
By the time these lines reach you the four Gospels will have passed 
through the press; for the work is going on well and prosperously, and I 
have little doubt that within five weeks it will be completed.       I have
already entered into arrangements respecting the binding with Mr. Borrego, 
who is about to unite bookbinding with printing; the terms are very 
reasonable, considering the current prices of the country, as I am to pay 
but three reals per volume for a calf binding similar to that of the
copy which was entrusted to me.       I have reckoned that the expense of 
each book, printing, paper, and binding included, will but barely amount to
15 reals; and cheaper than this it is utterly impossible to bring 
out a work of the size of the New Testament, handsomely and creditably in 
Spain.
Within a few days I shall despatch letters circular to all the principal
booksellers in Spain, specifying the nature, size and quality of the work, 
and inviting them to subscribe at 15 reals per copy, the prime cost;
for if anything will tempt them to a speculation of the kind, it will be 
the hope and prospect of making a very handsome profit.       Yet they are 
so short-sighted and, like all their countrymen, so utterly unacquainted 
with the rudiments of business, that it is by no means improbable that 
they, one and all, take no notice of this proposal, which is however the 
only plan which at present appears available for promoting the 
general circulation of the Scriptures.
Dr. Usoz, the gentleman who is at present assisting me in the editing of
the work in question, is very anxious to become a member and a 
correspondent of the Bible Society.       His letter on that subject I 
translated and transmitted previous to my last visit to England, but he has
never received an answer.       I beg leave to say that I am extremely 
desirous that his request be granted, and that he be written to without 
delay; and I must moreover beg to be furnished with a written or printed 
authority to establish a branch Bible Society in Madrid, and to nominate 
Dr. Usoz as secretary.
That part of my last letter, where I stated my wish of making a tour 
through the Asturias, Galicia, and the Biscays, as soon as the work should 
be completed, does not seem to have been clearly understood.       I did 
not intend to devote myself entirely to the wild people, but to 
visit the villages and towns as well as the remote and secluded 
glens.       I intended to take letters of introduction to some of the most
respectable people of Oviedo, of Corunna, of Lugo, of Vigo, Pontevedro, 
Barbastro, Bilboa, etc., and to establish dep       ts of Bibles in those 
towns; but in my way I intended to visit the secret and secluded spots 
amongst the rugged hills and mountains, and to talk to the people, after my
manner, of Christ and to explain to them the nature of His book, and to 
place that book in the hands of those whom I should deem capable of 
deriving benefit from it.       True it is that such a journey would be 
attended with considerable danger, and very possibly the fate of St. 
Stephen might befall the adventurer; but does the man deserve the name of a
follower of Christ who would shrink from danger of any kind in the cause of
Him whom he calls his Master?              He who loses his life for My 
sake, shall save it,        are words which the Lord Himself uttered, and 
words surely fraught with consolation to every one engaged in propagating 
His Gospel in savage and barbarian lands.
About a fortnight since I purchased another horse, for these animals are
at present exceedingly cheap.       A royal requisition is about to be 
issued for 5000, and the consequence is that an immense number are for 
sale; for by virtue of this requisition the horses of any person not a 
foreigner can be seized for the benefit of the service.       It is 
probable that when the number is made up the price of horses will be treble
what it is at present, which consideration induced me to purchase this 
animal before I exactly want him.       He is a black Andalusian stallion 
of great size and strength, and capable of performing a journey of 100 
leagues in a week       s time, but he is unbroke, savage and 
furious.       However, a cargo of Bibles which I hope shortly to put on 
his back will, I have no doubt, thoroughly tame him, especially when 
labouring up the flinty hills of the north of Spain.       I wished to 
purchase a mule, according to my instructions, but though I offered 
       30 for a sorry one, I could not obtain her; whereas the cost of both
the horses, tall, powerful, stately animals, scarcely amounted to that 
sum.
I will now say a few words respecting the state of Spain, though what I 
communicate will probably startle you, as in England you are quite in the 
dark respecting what is going on here.       At the moment I am writing, 
Cabrera, the tiger-friar, is within nine leagues of Madrid with an army 
nearly ten thousand strong; he has beaten the Queen       s troops in 
several engagements, and has ravaged La Mancha with fire and sword, burning
several towns; bands of affrighted fugitives are arriving every hour 
bringing tidings of woe and disaster, and I am but surprised that the enemy
does not appear, and by taking Madrid, which is at his mercy, put an end to
the war at once.       But the truth is, the Carlist generals do not wish 
the war to cease; for as long as the country is involved in bloodshed and 
anarchy, they can plunder and exercise that lawless authority so dear to 
men of fierce and brutal passions.       Cabrera is a wretch whose sole 
enjoyment consists in inflicting pain and torture and causing woe and 
misery to his fellow creatures; he is one of the instruments of the anger 
of the Almighty, a scourge in the hand of Providence to chastise a land 
whose wickedness had become intolerable.       For the elect       s sake, 
and there are a few even in Spain, may it please the Lord to shorten the 
affliction of these days, or all flesh must succumb.
I remain, dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. B.
P.S.       Pray let me hear from you shortly, and remember me 
particularly to Mr. Jowett and Mr. Browne.
P.S. 2.       I have already paid, in part, for the printing and 
paper, as you will have concluded by my draft.       The Gospel of Saint 
Luke, in the Rommany language, is nearly ready for the press.       It is 
my intention to subjoin a vocabulary of all the words used, with an 
explanation in the Spanish language.
Before I left England I was authorised to look out for a person 
competent to translate the Scriptures in Basque (Spanish).       I am 
acquainted with a gentleman who is well versed in that dialect, of which I 
myself have some knowledge.       Perhaps it would not be unwise to engage 
him to translate St. Luke as a trial of his powers.

Revd. Sir,       I write a few lines for the 
purpose of informing you that the New Testament in Castilian will be ready 
in a few days, probably before you receive this epistle, should it reach 
you, which I have some doubts of from the terrible and distracted state of 
Spain at the present time.
The work has been printed on the best paper, and no pains have been 
spared, at least on my part, to render it as correct as possible, having 
read every proof-sheet three times.       I must here take the liberty of 
observing that the work executed in London, and of which a copy was 
delivered to me to print from, abounds in errors of every kind and reflects
little credit on the person who edited it; no systematic order is observed 
either in the orthography or the use of accents or capitals, and whole 
sentences frequently appear in a mangled and mutilated state which renders 
them unintelligible.
On my final settlement with Mr. Borrego I shall send a regular account 
of my disbursements; he has already received two-thirds of his money, as 
you will have conjectured from the bills I have drawn.       I wish very 
much that the Committee would vote a letter of thanks to Mr. Henry 
O       Shea for the interest which he has taken in this affair and the 
assistance which he has rendered.       I shall write again in a few

[Madrid, 29 April, 1837].
Revd. and dear Sir,       Do me the favour 
after reading the enclosed letter, and making what use of it you please, to
seal it, pay the postage, and despatch it to Russia.       It contains all 
I have at present to say, and is as much intended for yourself, as for the 
person to whom it is directed.       I leave Madrid in about three days, 
and it is my intention to write frequently whilst upon my journey; but 
should few letters reach you, be not surprised, but attribute it to the 
state of the country, which is terrible indeed.       I am first going to 
Salamanca, by the pass of the Guadarama; from thence to Burgos; then to the
Asturias, Galicia, and Biscay, and along the whole chain of the 
Pyrenees.
Some hundreds of our books have been placed in the hands of a bookseller
at Madrid, and I have ordered them to be advertised, once a week, in the 
principal journals.       Dr. Usoz and another friend will do what they can
in my absence.
To-morrow I send the bill of my expenses; it would have been despatched 
sooner, but I could not obtain my account from Mr. O       Shea.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most faithfully yours,
G. Borrow.
P.S.       My best remembrances to Mr. Jowett, Mr. Browne, and 
all my friends.
To Mr. John Hasfeldt
Madrid, 29 
April, 1837.
I received your letter of last January a few weeks since, and I 
sincerely hope that mine of February may have reached your hands.       The
principal reason of my taking up the pen at present is the long and 
adventurous journey which I am about to engage in, and which I am afraid 
will preclude the possibility of my writing to you for some months.       
In a few days I quit Madrid, it being my intention to visit the mountainous
districts of Spain, particularly Galicia and the Basque Provinces, for the 
purpose of disposing of part of the edition of the New Testament in 
Spanish, lately completed at Madrid, under my superintendence.       It was
my intention to have set out sooner, but the state of the weather has been 
such that I thought it more prudent to defer my departure; during the last 
two months violent and bitter winds have blown without ceasing, before 
whose baneful influence animal and vegetable nature seems to have 
quailed.       I was myself, during a fortnight, prostrated, body and limb,
by a violent attack of la grippe, or, as it is styled in English, 
the        influenza.              I am, however, by the blessing of the 
Almighty, perfectly recovered and enjoying excellent spirits, but 
multitudes less favoured have perished, especially the poor.
I expect to be absent on my journey about five months, when, if I am 
spared, not having fallen a prey to sickness, Carlists, banditti, or wild 
beasts, I shall return to Madrid for the purpose of carrying through the 
press my own translation of the Gospel of St. Luke in the language of the 
Spanish Gypsies, and also the same Gospel in Cantabrian or Basque, executed
by the domestic physician of the Marquis of Salvatierra.       What I am 
destined to do subsequently I know not; but I should wish to visit China by
a land journey, either through Russia, or by Constantinople [and] Armenia 
as far as the Indian Gulf; as it is my opinion that, with God       s 
permission, I might sow some seed by the way which might in time yield a 
good harvest.
Speaking of these matters reminds me that in your next letter (written 
in your usual choice Danish) you might send me some useful information 
respecting what might be done in Russia.       Do you think permission 
might be obtained to print the New Testament in Russ, and that the Russian 
Hierarchy would be inclined to offer any serious opposition?       I wish 
you would speak to Gretsch on the subject, to whom you will, as usual, 
present my kindest remembrances.       I believe you are acquainted with 
Mrs. Biller, but if not, you would confer a great favour upon me by calling
on her, and requesting her opinion, as she is better acquainted than 
perhaps any person in Russia with the course to be pursued if the attempt 
were to be hazarded.       Perhaps at the same time you will enquire of her
as to what has become of my translation into Russ of the second and third 
Homilies which I left with her, and whether license to print has been 
obtained.       If not, I should wish that energetic steps be taken to that
effect, and as you are an energetic person, and she may possibly have too 
many important affairs upon her hands, I pray you to take the matter up, 
but at all events to follow her advice; pray remember me to her 
likewise.       The translation was corrected by that unfortunate man 
Nicanoff, who, though he lived and died a drunkard, was an excellent 
Russian scholar; therefore I think that no objection can reasonably be made
in respect to style, though indeed the original is very plain and homely, 
being adapted to the most common understanding.       I offer no apology 
for giving you all this trouble, as I am fully aware that you are at all 
times eagerly ready to perform anything which I may consider as a service 
rendered to myself.
Spain at present, I am sorry to say, is in a more distracted and 
convulsed situation than at any former period, and the prospect is gloomy 
in the extreme.       The Queen       s troops have sustained of late 
grievous defeats in the Basque provinces and Valencia, and a Carlist 
expedition of 18,000 men, whose object is to ravage Castile and to carry 
the war to the gates of Madrid, is shortly expected to pass the Ebro.      
From what I have seen and heard of the demoralised state of the Cristinos 
forces, I believe they will meet with no effectual resistance, and that 
Cristina and her daughter will be compelled to flee from the capital to 
Cadiz, or to some strong frontier town.       Nevertheless, such is the 
nature of the Spanish people, that it is impossible to say whether the 
liberal cause (as it is called) be desperate or not, as neither one party 
nor the other knows how to improve an advantage.       Twice might Don 
Carlos have marched to Madrid and seized the crown; and more than once his 
army has been at the mercy of the Cristinos; yet still is the affair 
undecided, and will perhaps continue so for years.       The country is, as
you may well conceive, in a most distracted state; robbery and murder are 
practised with impunity, and the roads are in such an insecure state that 
almost all communication has ceased between one town and another; yet I am 
going forth without the slightest fear, trusting in God; for if He is with 
me, who shall stand against me?
I have a servant, a person who has been a soldier for fifteen years, who
will go with me for the purpose of attending to the horses and otherwise 
assisting me in my labours.       His conduct on the journey is the only 
thing to which I look forward with uneasiness; for though he has some good 
points, yet in many respects a more atrocious fellow never existed.       
He is inordinately given to drink, and of so quarrelsome a disposition that
he is almost constantly involved in some broil.       Like most of his 
countrymen, he carries an exceedingly long knife, which he frequently 
unsheaths and brandishes in the faces of those who are unfortunate enough 
to awaken his choler.       It is only a few days since that I rescued the 
maid-servant of the house from his grasp, whom otherwise he would 
undoubtedly have killed, and all because she too much burnt a red herring 
which he had given her to cook.       You perhaps wonder that I retain a 
person of this description, but, bad as he is, he is the best servant I can
obtain; he is very honest, a virtue which is rarely to be found in a 
Spanish servant, and I have no fear of his running away with the horses 
during the journey, after having perhaps knocked me on the head in some 
lone posada.       He is moreover acquainted with every road, 
cross-road, river, and mountain in Spain, and is therefore a very suitable 
squire for an errant knight, like myself.       On my arrival in Biscay I 
shall perhaps engage one of the uncorrupted Basque peasants, who has never 
left his native mountains and is utterly ignorant of the Spanish language, 
for I am told that they are exceedingly faithful and laborious.       The 
best servant I ever had was the Tartar Mahmoud at St. Petersburg, and I 
have frequently repented that I did not bring him with me on my leaving 
Russia; but I was not then aware that I was about to visit this unfortunate
country, where goodness of every description is so difficult to find.

Madrid, May 10th, 1837.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I herewith send the
long promised account of my private expenses, which I hope will be found 
correct.       I start to-morrow for Salamanca, at which place I should now
be, but for the misconduct of my servant, whom I have been compelled to 
turn away.       I have experienced great difficulty in obtaining another; 
my present one is a Greek, who formerly waited on Mr. O       Shea; I hope 
he will turn out well.       Mr. O       Shea has given me a general letter
of credit to his correspondents in various parts of Spain.       You will 
receive my draft in a few days.       I shall write from Salamanca, and 
various other places, detailing all my proceedings and adventures.       I 
hope you received my last letter.
I remain, etc.,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. June 21, 1837)
Salamanca, June 7, 1837.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I arrived at 
Salamanca about a fortnight since, in safety and in tolerable good 
health.       I shall defer for a few days communicating the particulars of
my journey, though they are not destitute of interest, having at present 
information to afford which I consider of more importance, and which I hope
will afford the same satisfaction to yourself and our friends at home which
I myself experience in communicating them.
Some days previous to my departure from Madrid I was very much 
indisposed.       Owing to the state of the weather       for violent and 
biting winds had long prevailed       I had been attacked with a severe 
cold which terminated in a shrieking disagreeable cough, which the many 
remedies which I successively tried were unable to subdue.       I had made
preparation for departing on a particular day, but owing to the state of my
health I was apprehensive that I should be compelled to postpone my journey
for a time.       The last day of my stay in Madrid, finding myself 
scarcely able to stand, I was fain to submit to a somewhat desperate 
experiment, and by the advice of the barber-surgeon who visited me, I 
determined to be bled.       Late on the night of that same day he eased me
of sixteen ounces of blood, and having received his fee, left me, wishing 
me a pleasant journey, and assuring me upon his reputation that by noon the
next day I should be perfectly recovered.
A few minutes after his departure, whilst I was sitting alone, 
meditating on the journey which I was about to undertake, and on the 
rickety state of my health, I heard a loud knock at the street-door of the 
house, on the third floor of which I was lodged, not very 
comfortably.       In a minute or two Mr. Southern of the British Embassy 
entered my apartment.       After a little conversation he informed me that
Mr. Villiers had desired him to wait upon me, to communicate a resolution 
which he, Mr. Villiers, had come to.       Being apprehensive that alone 
and unassisted I should experience considerable difficulty in propagating 
the Gospel of God to any considerable extent in Spain, he was bent upon 
exerting to the utmost his own credit and influence to further my views, 
which he himself considered, if carried into proper effect, extremely well 
calculated to operate beneficially on the political and moral state of the 
country.       To this end it was his intention to purchase a very 
considerable number of copies of the New Testament, and to despatch them 
forthwith to the various British consuls established in different parts of 
Spain, with strict and positive orders to employ all the means, which their
official situation should afford them, to circulate the books in question 
and to assure their being noticed.       They were moreover to be charged 
to afford myself, whenever I should appear in their respective districts, 
all the protection, encouragement, and assistance I should stand in need 
of, as a friend of Mr. Villiers, and a person in the success of whose 
enterprise he himself took the warmest interest.
I could scarcely believe my ears on receiving this information; for 
though I had long been aware that Mr. Villiers was at all times willing to 
assist me, he having frequently given me sufficient proof, I could never 
expect that he would come forward in so noble, and to say the least of it, 
considering his high diplomatic situation, so bold and decided a 
manner.       I believe that this is the first instance of a British 
Ambassador having made the cause of the Bible Society a national one, or 
indeed to favour it directly or indirectly.       What renders the case of 
Mr. Villiers more remarkable is that on my first arrival at Madrid I found 
him by no means well disposed towards the Society.       The Holy Spirit 
has probably illumined his mind on this point.       Honour be to him: I 
hope that by his means our institution will shortly possess many agents in 
Spain with far more power and opportunity than I myself can ever expect to 
possess, who will scatter abroad the seed of the Gospel, and make of a 
barren and thirsty wilderness a green and smiling corn-field.
The next day verified the prediction of the barber.       I had to a 
considerable degree lost my cough and fever, though, owing to the great 
loss of blood, I was very feeble and weak.       Precisely at twelve 
o       clock myself and man rode forth from the gate of Saint Vincent, 
directing our course to the lofty mountains which separate Old from New 
Castile.       That night we rested at Guadarama, a large village at their 
foot, distant from Madrid about twenty-five miles.       The journey to 
Salamanca occupied four days, and I disposed of five Testaments by the 
way.
Since my arrival at Salamanca I have been taking measures that the Word 
of God may become generally known in this place, so celebrated in many 
respects.       The principal bookseller of the town, Blanco, a man of 
great wealth and respectability, has consented to become our agent here, 
and I have deposited in his shop a certain number of New Testaments.       
He is the proprietor of a small printing press, where the official bulletin
of the place is published.       For this bulletin I have prepared an 
advertisement of the work, in which amongst other things I have said that 
the New Testament is the only guide to salvation.       I have also spoken 
of the Bible Society, and the great pecuniary sacrifices which it is making
with the view of proclaiming Christ crucified, and of making His doctrine 
known.       This step will perhaps be considered by some as too bold, but 
I am not aware that I can take any more calculated to arouse the attention 
of the people       a considerable point.       I have also ordered numbers
of the same advertisement to be struck off in the shape of bills which I am
causing to be stuck up in various parts of the town.       I have great 
hope that by means of these a considerable number of New Testaments will be
sold.       I shall repeat this experiment in Valladolid, Leon, St. Jago, 
and all the principal towns which it is my intention to visit in my 
wanderings, and I shall likewise distribute them as I ride along.       The
children of Spain will thus be brought to know that such a work as the New 
Testament is in existence, a fact of which not five in one hundred are at 
present aware, notwithstanding their so frequently repeated boasts of their
Catholicity and Christianity.
I carry with me the Gospel of St. Luke in the Cantabrian or Basque 
language.       It is my intention to print this little book, either at San
Sebastian or Pamplona; as it would be unwise not to avail myself of so 
favourable an opportunity of circulating it as my visit to the provinces 
where the language is spoken will afford me.       I have examined it with 
much attention, and find it a very faithful version.       The only 
objection which can be brought against it is that Spanish words are 
frequently used to express ideas for which there are equivalents in Basque;
but this language, as spoken at present in Spain, is very corrupt, and a 
work written entirely in the Basque of Larramendi       s Dictionary would 
be intelligible to very few.       I have read passages from it to the men 
of Guipuscoa, who assured me that they had no difficulty in understanding 
it, and that it was written in the colloquial style of their province.

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. July 25, 1837)
Astorga, 5th July, 1837.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I avail myself of 
the present opportunity of giving an account of what has befallen me since 
I last wrote to you from Salamanca, which I shortly after quitted.       By
that time my advertisements had been affixed in all parts of the city, and 
several New Testaments had been sold; I myself had the pleasure of seeing 
three despatched in less than a quarter of an hour that I remained in the 
shop.       From Salamanca I proceeded to Valladolid, distant about 
twenty-five leagues, where I employed the same means which I had adopted at
Salamanca for the promulgation of God       s Word.       I must here 
observe that Valladolid is a place where literature of every description is
at the lowest ebb, and bookselling there is merely carried on in connexion 
with other business, it being in itself quite insufficient to afford a 
livelihood to those who pursue it.       Nevertheless during the five days 
that I continued there my labours were so far favoured that twenty copies 
were disposed of, and a fair prospect opened that many more would be 
demanded.       Before leaving I gave orders that the advertisements should
be renewed every week, as evil-disposed, persons probably of the Carlist or
Papist party, had defaced or torn down a great number of those which had 
been put up.       From pursuing this course I expect that much and 
manifold good will accrue, as the people of these parts will have continual
opportunities of acquainting themselves that a book which contains the 
living word is in existence and within their reach, which may induce
them to secure it and consult it even unto salvation.
Quitting Valladolid, I directed my route to Leon by the Palencia road; 
the greatest part of the way was barren and uninteresting to a high degree,
consisting of wide dusty plains scantily sown with barley, but unrelieved 
with trees or waters.       The people are ignorant and brutal, though they
boast themselves to be Old Castilians, which is however not the fact, as 
these desolate and benighted regions belong to what was once the kingdom of
Leon.       Their inhospitality is so great that I have been refused a 
glass of water in their villages, though I asked it in the name of God; 
though I have subsequently obtained it by paying for it, for their hearts 
can always be opened by the key of interest, though inaccessible to every 
noble and generous sentiment.       I suffered dreadfully during this 
journey, as did likewise my man and horses, for the heat was the fiercest 
which I have ever known, and resembled the breath of the simoom or the air 
from an oven       s mouth.       Leon is beautifully situated in a smiling
blooming country abounding in grass and trees, and watered by many streams 
which have their source in a mighty chain of mountains in the 
neighbourhood, which traverse a great part of Spain and are connected with 
the Pyrenees; but unfortunately it is exceedingly unhealthy, for the heats 
of the summer-time raise noxious exhalations from the waters, which 
generate all kinds of disorders, especially fevers and tertian agues.      
It is the Feversham of Spain.
Nomen cui infausta Fata dedere febris [sic].
I had scarcely been at Leon three days when I was seized with a fever, 
against which I thought the strength even of my constitution would have 
yielded; for it wore me almost to a skeleton, and when it departed, at the 
end of about a week, left me in such a deplorable state of weakness that I 
was scarcely able to make the slightest exertion.       I had however 
previously persuaded a bookseller to undertake the charge of vending the 
Testaments, and had published my advertisements as usual, though without 
very fervent hope of success, as Leon is a place where the inhabitants, 
with very few exceptions, are furious Carlists and ignorant and blinded 
followers of the old Papal Church.       It is, moreover, a Bishop       s 
see, which was once enjoyed by the prime councillor of Don Carlos, whose 
fierce and bigoted spirit still seems to pervade the place.       Scarcely 
had the advertisements appeared when the clergy were in motion; they went 
from house to house, banning and cursing and denouncing misery on 
whomsoever should either purchase or read        the accursed books        
which had been sent into the country by heretics for the purpose of 
perverting the innocent minds of the population.       They did more: they 
commenced a process against the bookseller in the ecclesiastical 
court.       Fortunately this court is not at present in the possession of 
much authority, and the bookseller, who is a bold and determined man, set 
them at defiance, and went so far as to affix an advertisement to the gate 
of the very cathedral.       Notwithstanding the cry raised against the 
work several copies were sold at Leon, two were purchased by ex-friars, and
the same number by parochial priests from neighbouring villages.       I 
believe the whole number disposed of during my stay amounted to fifteen, so
that my visit to this dark corner has not been altogether in vain, as the 
seed of the Gospel has been sown, though sparingly.       But the 
palpableness of the darkness which envelops Leon is truly lamentable, and 
the ignorance of the people is so great that printed charms and 
incantations against Satan and his host and against every kind of 
misfortune are publicly sold in the shops and are in great demand; such are
the results of Popery, a delusion which more than any other has tended to 
debase and brutalise the human mind.
I had scarcely risen from the bed where the fever had cast me, when I 
found that my servant had become alarmed; he informed me that he had seen 
several soldiers in the uniform of Don Carlos knocking at the door of the 
posada, and that they had been making enquiries concerning me.      
It was indeed a singular fact connected with Leon that upwards of fifty of 
these fellows, who had on various accounts left the ranks of the pretender,
were walking about the streets dressed in his livery, and with all the 
confidence which the certainty of the protection of the local authorities 
could afford them, should any one be disposed to interrupt them.       He 
moreover informed me that the person in whose house we were living was a 
notorious alcahuete, or spy to the robbers in the neighbourhood, and
that unless we took our departure speedily and unexpectedly, we should to a
certainty be plundered on the road.       I did not pay much attention to 
these hints, but my desire to quit Leon was great, as I was convinced that 
as long as I continued there I should be unable to regain my health and 
vigour.       Accordingly, at three o       clock in the morning of the 
fourth (yesterday) we departed, taking the route for Lugo, a principal town
in the province of Galicia.       We had scarcely proceeded half a league 
when we were overtaken by a thunderstorm of tremendous violence.       We 
were at that time in the midst of a kind of wood which extends to some 
distance in that direction.       The trees were bowed to the ground or 
torn up by their roots by the wind, whilst the ground was plowed up by the 
lightning which burst all around and nearly blinded us.       The horse 
which I rode upon, which was a spirited Andalusian stallion, became furious
and bounded into the air as if possessed; owing to my state of weakness I 
had the greatest difficulty in maintaining my seat and in avoiding a fall 
which might have been fatal.       A tremendous discharge of rain followed 
the storm, which swelled the brooks into streams and flooded the 
surrounding country, causing great damage amongst the corn.       After 
riding about five leagues we began to enter the mountainous district which 
surrounds Astorga; the road was flinty and very trying to the poor horses, 
who suffered much, whilst the heat was suffocating.       It was with the 
utmost difficulty that we reached Astorga, covered with mud and dust and 
our tongues cleaving to the roofs of our mouths from thirst.       We were 
compelled to take up our abode in a wretched hovel, full of pigs, vermin, 
and misery, and from this place I write, for this morning I felt myself 
unable to proceed on my journey, being exhausted with illness, fatigue and 
want of food, for scarcely anything is to be obtained.       But I return 
God thanks and glory for being permitted to undergo these crosses and 
troubles for His Word       s sake.       I would not exchange my present 
situation, unenviable as some may think it, for a throne.
Pray excuse the style and writing of this letter, both are inevitably 
bad.       I hope in a few days to have reached Lugo, where I shall be more
at my ease.

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. 12th August 1837) br

Corunna, 20th July [1837].
Revd. and dear Sir,       My last letter was 
dated from Astorga, and I stated that I was suffering from the relics of 
the fever which had assailed me at Leon; in a day or two, however, I was 
sufficiently recovered to mount my horse and proceed on my journey to 
Lugo.       I shall send a regular account of this journey next post, from 
which those at home, interested in Bible proceedings in Spain, may gather 
some idea of this very strange country and people.       I arrived safely 
at Lugo, but much fatigued, for the way thither lay through the wildest 
mountains and wildernesses.       The Lord deigned to favour my humble 
efforts at Lugo; I brought thither thirty Testaments, all of which were 
disposed of in one day, the Bishop of the place himself purchasing two 
copies, whilst several priests and friars, instead of following the example
of their brethren at Leon by persecuting the work, spoke well of it, and 
recommended its perusal.       I was much grieved that my stock of these 
holy books was exhausted, for there was a great demand for them; and had I 
been able to supply them, quadruple the quantity might have been sold 
[during] the four days that I remained at Lugo.
Midway between Lugo and Corunna I was near falling into the hands of 
robbers.       Two fellows suddenly confronted me with presented carbines, 
which they probably intended to discharge into my body, but they took 
fright at the noise of my servant       s horse, who was following a little
way behind.       This affair occurred at the bridge Castellanos, a spot 
notorious for robbery and murder, and well adapted for both, for it stands 
at the bottom of a deep dell surrounded by wild desolate hills.       Only 
a quarter of an hour previous, I had passed three ghastly heads, stuck on 
poles standing by the wayside; they were those of a captain of banditti 
[and two of his men], who had been seized and executed about two months 
before.       Their principal haunt was the vicinity of the bridge I have 
already spoken of, and it was their practice to cast the bodies of the 
murdered into the deep black water which runs rapidly beneath.       These 
three beads will always live in my remembrance, particularly that of the 
captain, which stood on a higher pole than the other two; the long hair was
waving in the wind, and the blackened distorted features were grinning in 
the sun.       The fellows whom I met were themselves of his band.
I have a dep       t of five hundred Testaments at Corunna, from which 
it is my intention to supply the principal towns of Galicia.       I have 
as usual published my advertisements, and the work enjoys a tolerable 
sale       seven or eight copies per day on the average.       Perhaps some
will say that these are small matters and not worthy of being mentioned; 
but let these bethink them that till within a few months the very existence
of the Gospel was almost unknown in Spain, and that it must necessarily be 
a difficult task to induce a people like the Spaniards, who read very 
little and who in general consider money expended in books of any kind as 
cast away, to purchase a work like the New Testament, offering them little 
prospect of amusement, and which, though the basis of all true religion, 
they have never been told is useful as a guide to salvation.
Let us hope that the present is the dawning of better and more 
enlightened times, and though little has been accomplished, still it is 
more than nothing that Testaments are being sold in unhappy benighted 
Spain, from Madrid to the northernmost part of Galicia, a distance of 
nearly four hundred miles.
In about a fortnight I shall depart for Santiago, where I intend to pass
several days; then retracing my steps to Corunna I shall visit Ferrol, 
whence I shall perhaps shape my course for Oviedo in the Asturias, either 
along the seashore or by the mountain route, in which latter case I should 
have to revisit Lugo.       Every part of Galicia abounds with robbers and 
factious, so that almost all travelling is at an end, and the road to 
Santiago is so bad that no one is permitted to travel it unless in company 
with the weekly post, which goes attended by a strong military 
escort.       This gives me some uneasiness, as the stallion I ride is so 
vicious and furious that it is dangerous to bring him in contact with other
horses whom, with the exception of his companion, he invariably attacks, 
getting me into all manner of scrapes.       An old Castilian peasant, 
whose pony he had maltreated, once said to me,        Sir Cavalier, if you 
have any love for yourself, get rid of that beast, who is capable of 
proving the ruin of a kingdom.              But he is a gallant creature 
who seldom tires, and he has borne me too far to permit me to think of 
parting with him.
Since my arrival at Corunna I have received advice from my agent at 
Valladolid that the forty copies which I deposited in his hands have been 
sold, and that he was anxious for a fresh supply.       I have accordingly 
ordered fifty more to be sent him from Madrid.       Since my departure 
from the capital I have myself disposed of sixty-five, without including 
those sold at Lugo and other places by means of the advertisements, on 
which I principally rely, as they speak at all times whether I am present 
or absent.
I wish it to be distinctly understood that throughout my journey I have 
given away none of the books, having invariably received money for them, 
viz., from 10 to 12 reals.       The enemies of the Bible Society 
have stated in several publications that it has no vent for the Bibles and 
Testaments which it publishes in many foreign languages but by sending them
to the various countries, and there distributing them gratis or selling 
them by auction, when they are bought for waste paper (see in particular 
Wiseman       s Letters).       My conduct in this point has been 
principally influenced by a desire to give, in the case of Spain at least, 
the direct lie to this assertion, and this conduct I shall pursue until I 
receive direct orders to abandon it.       I will now conclude by repeating
that in a few days you will receive my journal, which will prove more 
interesting than the above hasty scrawl.
I remain, etc.,
G. Borrow.

Journey from Astorga to Lugo
Before proceeding to narrate what befell me in this journey, it will 
perhaps not be amiss to say a few words concerning Astorga and its 
vicinity.       It is a walled town containing about five or six thousand 
inhabitants, with a cathedral and college, which last is, however, at 
present deserted.       It is situated on the confines, and may be called 
the capital, of a tract of land called the country of the Maragatos, which 
occupies about three square leagues, and has for its north-western boundary
a mountain called Telleno, the loftiest of a chain of hills which have 
their origin near the mouth of the river Minho, and are connected with the 
immense range which constitutes the frontier of the Asturias and 
Guipuscoa.       The land is ungrateful and barren, and niggardly repays 
the toil of the cultivator, being for the most part rocky, with a slight 
sprinkling of a red bricky earth.       The Maragatos are perhaps the most 
singular caste to be found amongst the chequered population of Spain.      
They have their own peculiar customs and dress, and never intermarry with 
the Spaniards.       Their name is a clue to their origin, as it signifies 
       Moorish Goths,        and at this present day their garb differs but
little from that of the Moors of Barbary, as it consists of a long tight 
jacket, secured at the waist by a broad girdle; loose short trowsers which 
terminate at the knee, and boots and gaiters.       Their heads are shaven,
a slight fringe of hair being only left at the lower part.       If they 
wore the turban, or barret, they could scarcely be distinguished from the 
Moors in dress, but in lieu thereof they wear the sombrero or broad 
slouching hat of Spain.       There can be little doubt that they are a 
remnant of those Goths who sided with the Moors on their invasion of Spain,
and who adopted their religion, customs, and manner of dress, which, with 
the exception of the first, are still to a considerable degree 
retained.       It is, however, evident that their blood has at no time 
mingled with that of the wild children of the desert, for scarcely amongst 
the hills of Norway would you find figures and faces more essentially 
Gothic than those of the Maragatos.       They are strong, athletic men, 
but loutish and heavy, and their features, though for the most part 
well-formed, are vacant and devoid of expression.       They are slow and 
plain in speech, and those eloquent and imaginative sallies so common in 
the conversation of other Spaniards seldom or never escape them; they have,
moreover, a coarse, thick pronunciation, and when you hear them speak, you 
almost imagine that it is some German or English peasant attempting to 
express himself in the language of the Peninsula.       They are 
constitutionally phlegmatic, and it is very difficult to arouse their 
anger; but they are dangerous and desperate when once incensed, and a 
person who knew them well told me that he would rather face ten Valencians,
people infamous for their ferocity and blood-thirstiness, than confront one
angry Maragato, sluggish and stupid though he be on other occasions.
The men scarcely ever occupy themselves in husbandry, which they abandon
to the females, who plough the flinty fields and gather in the scanty 
harvests.       Their husbands and sons are far differently employed, for 
they are a nation of arrieros or carriers, and almost esteem it a 
disgrace to follow any other profession.       On every road of Spain, 
particularly those north of the mountains which divide the two Castiles, 
may be seen gangs of fives and sixes of these people lolling or sleeping 
beneath the broiling sun on their gigantic and heavily laden mutes and 
mules, the boast of Spain, but dearly purchased by the debasement and 
degeneration of a once noble breed of horses.       In a word, almost the 
entire commerce of nearly one half of Spain passes through the hands of the
Maragatos, whose fidelity to their trust is such that no one accustomed to 
employ them would hesitate to entrust them with the transport of a ton of 
treasure from the sea of Biscay to Madrid, knowing well that it would not 
be their fault were it not delivered safe and undiminished even of a grain,
and that bold must be the thieves who would seek to wrest it from the 
far-feared Maragatos, who would cling to it whilst they could stand, and 
would cover it with their bodies when they fell in the act of loading or 
discharging their long carbines.
But they are far from being disinterested, and if they are the most 
trustworthy of all the arrieros of Spain, they in general demand for
the transport of articles a sum at least double of what others of the trade
would esteem a reasonable recompense.       By this means they accumulate 
large sums of money, notwithstanding that they indulge themselves in a far 
superior fare to that which contents in general the parsimonious 
Spaniard       another argument in favour of their pure Gothic descent; for
the Maragatos, like true men of the north, delight in swilling liquors and 
battening upon gross and luscious meats, which help to swell out their tall
and goodly figures.       Many of them have died possessed of considerable 
riches, part of which they have not unfrequently bequeathed to the erection
or embellishment of religious houses.       On the east end of the 
cathedral of Astorga, which towers over the lofty and precipitous wall, a 
colossal figure of lead may be seen on the roof.       It is the statue of 
a Maragato carrier, who endowed the cathedral with a large sum.       He is
in his national dress, but his head is averted from the land of his 
fathers, and whilst he waves in his hand a species of flag, he seems to be 
summoning his race from their unfruitful region to other climes where a 
richer field is open to their industry and enterprise.
I spoke to several of these men respecting the all-important subject of 
religion; but        I found their hearts blunted, and with their ears they
heard heavily, and their eyes were closed.              There was one in 
particular to whom I showed the New Testament and addressed for a 
considerable time.       He listened, or seemed to listen, patiently, 
taking occasional copious draughts from an immense jug of whitish wine 
which stood between his knees.       After I had concluded, he said: 
       To-morrow I set out for Lugo, whither I am told yourself are 
going.       If you wish to send your chest, I have no objection to take it
at so much (naming an extravagant price).       As for what you have told 
me, I understand little of it and believe not a word of it; but in respect 
to the books which you have shown me, I will take three or four.       I 
shall not read them, it is true, but I have no doubt that I can sell them 
at a higher price than you demand.       
So much for the Maragatos.
It was four o       clock of a beautiful morning that we sallied from 
Astorga, or rather from the suburbs in which we had been lodged; we 
directed our course to the north in the direction of Galicia.       Leaving
the mountain Telleno on our left, we passed along the eastern skirts of the
land of the Maragatos over broken uneven ground, enlivened here and there 
by small green valleys and runs of water.       Several of the Maragato 
women mounted on donkeys passed us on their way to Astorga whither they 
were carrying vegetables; we saw others in the fields handling their rude 
ploughs drawn by lean oxen; we likewise passed through a small village in 
which we however saw no living soul.       Near this village we entered the
high road which leads direct from Madrid to Corunna, and at last having 
travelled near four leagues we came to a species of pass formed on our left
by a huge lumpish hill (one of those which descend from the great mountain 
Telleno), and on our right by one of considerably less altitude.       In 
the middle of this pass which was of considerable breadth, a noble view 
opened itself to us.       Before us, at the distance of about a league and
a half, rose the mighty frontier chain of which I have spoken before; its 
blue sides and broken and picturesque peaks still wearing a thin veil of 
the morning mist, which the fierce rays of the sun were fast 
dispelling.       It seemed an enormous barrier threatening to oppose our 
further progress, and it reminded me of the fables respecting the children 
of Magog, who are said to reside in remotest Tartary behind a gigantic wall
of rocks which can only be passed by a gate of steel a thousand cubits in 
height.
We shortly after arrived at Manzanal, a village consisting of wretched 
huts, and exhibiting every sign of poverty and misery.       It was now 
time to refresh ourselves and horses, and we accordingly put up at a kind 
of venta, the last habitation in the village, where, though we found
barley for the animals, we had much difficulty in procuring anything for 
ourselves.       I was at last fortunate enough to obtain a large jug of 
milk, for there were plenty of cows in the neighbourhood feeding in a 
picturesque valley which we had passed by, in which there was abundance of 
grass and trees and a run of water broken by tiny cascades.       The jug 
might contain about half a gallon, but I emptied it in a few minutes, for 
the thirst of fever was still burning within me though I was destitute of 
appetite.       The venta had something the appearance of a German 
baiting house.       It consisted of an immense stable, from which was 
partitioned a kind of kitchen and a place where the family slept.       The
master, a robust young man, lolled on a large solid stone bench which stood
within the door.       He was very inquisitive respecting news, but I could
afford him none; whereupon he became communicative, and gave me the history
of his life, the sum of which was that he had been a courier in the Basque 
provinces, but about a year since had been despatched to this village where
he kept the post-house.       He was an enthusiastic liberal, and spoke in 
bitter terms of the surrounding population, who, he said, were all Carlists
and friends of the friars.       I paid little attention to his discourse, 
for I was looking at a Maragato lad of about fourteen who served in the 
house as a kind of ostler.       I asked the master if we were still in the
land of the Maragatos, but he told me that we had left it behind nearly a 
league, and that the lad was an orphan, and was serving until he could rake
up a sufficient capital to become an arriero.       I addressed 
several questions to the boy, but the urchin looked sullenly in my face, 
and either answered by monosyllables or was doggedly silent.       I asked 
him if he could read:        Yes,        said he,        as much as that 
black brute of yours who is tearing down the manger.       
Quitting Manzanal, we continued our course, the ground gradually 
descending; we soon arrived at a place where the road took a turn to the 
west, though previously it had tended due north.       We now found that we
had to descend the steep sides of a deep and narrow valley which wound 
amongst mountains, not those of the chain which we had seen before us and 
which we had left at our right, but those of the Telleno range, just before
they unite with that chain.       Arrived at the brink of the valley we 
turned into a foot-path, to avoid making a considerable circuit, for we saw
the road on the other side of the valley opposite to us about a furlong 
[distant], and the path appeared to lead direct towards it.       We had 
not gone far before we met two Galicians on their way to cut the harvests 
of Castile.       One of them shouted,        Cavalier, turn back: in a 
moment you will be amongst precipices where your horses will break their 
necks, for we ourselves could scarcely climb them on foot.              The
other cried,        Cavalier, proceed, but be careful, and your horses, if 
sure-footed, will run no great danger; my comrade is a fool.              A
violent dispute instantly ensued between the two mountaineers, each 
supporting his opinion with loud oaths and curses; but without stopping to 
see the result I passed on.       But the path was now filled with stones 
and huge slaty rocks, on which my horse slid, frequently on his 
haunches.       I likewise heard the sound of water in a deep gorge, which 
I had hitherto not perceived, and I soon saw that it would be worse than 
madness to proceed.       I turned my horse and was hastening to regain the
path which I had left, when Antonio, my faithful Greek, pointed out to me a
meadow, by which he said we might regain the high road much lower down than
if we returned on our steps.       The meadow was brilliant with short 
green grass, and in the middle there was a small rivulet of water.       I 
spurred my horse on, expecting to be in the high road in a moment; the 
horse, however, snorted and stared wildly, and was evidently unwilling to 
cross the seemingly inviting spot.       I thought that the scent of a wolf
or some other wild animal might have disturbed him, but was soon undeceived
by his sinking up to the knees in a bog.       The animal uttered a shrill 
sharp neigh, and exhibited every sign of the greatest terror, making at the
same time great efforts to extricate himself, and plunging forward, but 
every moment sinking deeper.       At last he arrived where a small vein of
rock showed itself, on this he placed his fore feet, and with one 
tremendous exertion freed himself from the deceitful soil, springing over 
the rivulet and alighting on comparatively firm ground, where he stood 
panting, his heaving sides covered with a foamy sweat.       Antonio, who 
had been a terrified observer of the whole scene, afraid to venture 
forward, returned by the path by which we came and shortly afterwards 
rejoined me.       This adventure brought to my recollection the meadow 
with its foot-path, which tempted Christian from the straight road to 
heaven, and finally conducted him to the dominions of the Giant 
Despair.

No hay atajo
Sin trabajo.
       There is no short cut
Without some deep rut.       

says the Spanish proverb.
We now began to descend the valley by a broad and excellent 
carretera, or carriage road, which was cut out of the steep side of 
the mountain on our right.       On our left was the gorge, down which 
tumbled the run of water which I have before mentioned.       The road was 
tortuous, and at every turn the scene became more picturesque.       The 
gorge gradually widened, and the brook at its bottom, fed by a multitude of
springs, [grew] more considerable; but it was soon far beneath us, pursuing
its headlong course till it reached level ground, where it flowed in the 
midst of a beautiful but confined prairie.       There was something silvan
and savage in the mountains on the further side, clad from foot to pinnacle
with trees, so closely growing that the eye was unable to obtain a glimpse 
of the hill-sides which were uneven with ravines and gulleys, the haunts of
the wolf, the wild boar and the corso or mountain-stag; the last of 
which, as I was informed by a peasant who was driving a car of oxen, 
frequently descended to feed in the prairie and were shot for the sake of 
their skins, for the flesh being strong and disagreeable is held at no 
account.       But notwithstanding the wildness of these regions, the 
handiworks of man were visible.       The sides of the gorge though 
precipitous were yellow with little fields of barley, and we saw a hamlet 
and church down in the prairie below, whilst merry songs ascended to our 
ears from where the mowers were toiling with their scythes, cutting the 
luxuriant and abundant grass.       I could scarcely believe that I was in 
Spain, in general so brown, so arid and cheerless, and I almost fancied 
myself in Greece, in that land of ancient glory, whose mountain and forest 
scenery Theocritus has so well described.
At the bottom of the valley we entered a small village washed by the 
brook, which had now swelled almost to a stream.       A more romantic 
situation I had never witnessed.       It was surrounded and almost 
overhung by huge mountains, and embowered in trees of various kinds; waters
sounded, nightingales sang, and the cuckoo       s full note boomed from 
the distant branches, but the village was miserable.       The huts were 
built of slate-stones, of which the neighbouring hills seemed to be 
principally composed, and roofed with the same, but not in the neat tidy 
manner of English houses, for the slates were of all sizes, and seemed to 
be flung on in confusion.       We were spent with heat and thirst, and 
sitting down on a stone bench I entreated a woman to give us a little 
water.       The woman said she would, but added that she expected to be 
paid for it.       My Greek on hearing this burst into horrid execrations, 
and speaking Greek, Turkish and Spanish invoked the vengeance of the 
Panhagia on the heartless woman, saying        If I were to offer a 
Mahometan gold for a draught of water, he would dash it in my face; and you
are a Catholic with the stream running at your door.              I told 
him to be silent, and giving the woman two cuartos repeated my 
request; whereupon she took a pitcher, and, going to the stream, filled it 
with water.       It tasted muddy and disagreeable, but it drowned the 
fever which was devouring me.
We again mounted and proceeded on our way, which for a considerable 
distance lay along the margin of the stream, which now fell in small 
cataracts, now brawled over stones, and at other times ran dark and silent 
through deep pools overhung with tall willows       pools which seemed to 
abound with the finny tribe, for huge trout frequently sprang from the 
water catching the brilliant fly which skimmed along its deceitful 
surface.       How delightful!       The sun was rolling high in the 
firmament, casting from its girdle of fire the most glorious rays, so that 
the atmosphere was flickering with their splendour; but their fierceness 
was either warded off by the shadow of the trees or rendered innocuous 
either by the refreshing coolness which rose from the waters or by the 
gentle breezes which murmured at intervals over the meadows        fanning 
the cheek or raising the hair        of the wanderer.       The hills 
gradually receded, till at last we entered a plain where tall grass was 
undulating, and mighty chestnut-trees in full blossom spread their giant 
and umbrageous boughs.       Beneath many stood cars, the tired oxen 
prostrate on the ground, the cross-bar of the pole which they support 
pressing heavily on their heads, whilst their drivers were either employed 
in cooking or were enjoying a delicious siesta in the grass and 
shade.       I went up to one of the largest of these groups and demanded 
of the individuals whether they were in need of the Testament of Jesus 
Christ.       They stared at one another and then at me, till at last a 
young man who was dandling a long gun in his hands as he reclined demanded 
of me what it was, at the same time enquiring whether I was a Catalan, 
       for you speak hoarse,        said he,        and are tall and fair 
like that family.              I sat down amongst them and said I was no 
Catalan, but I came from a spot in the western sea many leagues distant to 
sell that book at half the price it cost, and that their souls        
welfare depended upon their being acquainted with it.       I then 
explained to them the nature of the New Testament and read to them the 
Parable of the Sower.       They stared at each other again, but said that 
they were poor and could not buy books.       I rose, mounted, and was 
going away, saying to them:        Peace bide with you.              
Whereupon the young man with the gun rose, and saying; 
       Caspita! this is odd,        snatched the book from my hand, 
and gave me the price I had demanded.
Perhaps the whole world might be searched in vain for a spot whose 
natural charms could rival those of this plain or valley of Bembibre, with 
its wall of mighty mountains, its spreading chestnut-trees, and its groves 
of oaks and willows which clothe the banks of its stream, a tributary to 
the Minho.       True it is that when I passed through it the candle of 
heaven was blazing in full splendour, and everything lighted by its rays 
looked gay, glad and blessed.       Whether it would have filled me with 
the same feelings of admiration if viewed beneath another sky I will not 
pretend to determine, but it certainly possessed advantages which at no 
time could fail to delight; for it exhibited all the peaceful beauties of 
an English landscape blended with something wild and grand, and I thought 
within myself that he must be a restless dissatisfied man who born amongst 
those scenes would wish to quit them.       At the time I would have 
desired no better fate than that of a shepherd on the prairies or a hunter 
on the hills of Bembibre.
Three hours passed away, and we were in another situation.       We had 
halted and refreshed ourselves and horses at Bembibre, a village of mud and
slate, and which possessed little to attract attention.       We were now 
ascending, for the road was over one of the extreme ledges of those 
frontier hills which I have before so often mentioned; but the aspect of 
heaven had blackened, clouds were rolling rapidly from the west over the 
mountains, and a cold wind was moaning dismally.              There is a 
storm travelling through the air,        said a peasant, whom we overtook 
mounted on a wretched mule,        and the Asturians had better be on the 
look-out, for it is speeding in their direction.              He had scarce
spoken when a light so vivid and dazzling that it seemed the whole lustre 
of the fiery element was concentrated therein broke around us, filling the 
whole atmosphere, and covering rock, tree and mountain with a glare 
indescribable.       The mule of the peasant tumbled prostrate, while the 
horse I rode reared himself perpendicularly, and turning round dashed down 
the hill at headlong speed which for some time it was impossible to 
check.       The lightning was followed by a peal almost as terrible, but 
distant, for it sounded hollow and deep; the hills, however, caught up its 
voice, seemingly pitching it along their summits, till it was lost in 
interminable space.       Other flashes and peals succeeded, but slight in 
comparison, and a few drops of rain; the body of the tempest seemed to be 
over another region.              A hundred families are weeping where that
bolt fell,        said the peasant, when I rejoined him,        for its 
blaze has blinded my mule at six leagues        distance.              He 
was leading the animal by the bridle, as its sight was evidently 
affected.              Were the friars still in their nest above 
there,        he continued,        I should say that this was their doing, 
for they are the cause of all the miseries of the land.       
I raised my eyes in the direction in which he pointed.       Half-way up
the mountain over whose foot we were wending jutted forth a black, 
frightful crag, which at an immense altitude overhung the road and seemed 
to threaten destruction.       It resembled one of those ledges of the 
rocky mountains in the picture of the deluge, up to which the terrified 
fugitives have scrambled from the eager pursuit of the savage and 
tremendous billow, down on which they are gazing in horror, whilst above 
them rise still higher and giddier heights to which they seem unable to 
climb.       Built on the very rim of this crag stood an edifice, seemingly
devoted to the purposes of religion, as I could discern the spire of a 
church rearing itself high over wall and roof.              That is the 
house of        The Virgin of the Rocks,               said the peasant, 
       and it was lately full of friars, but they have been driven out, and
the only inmates now are owls and ravens.              I replied that their
life in such a bleak exposed abode could not have been very enviable, as in
winter they must have incurred great risk of perishing with cold.       
       By no means,        said he;        they had the best of wood for 
their braseros and chimneys, and the best of wine to warm them at 
their meals, which were not the most sparing; moreover they had another 
convent down in the vale yonder, to which they could retire at their 
pleasure.              I asked him the reason of his antipathy to the 
friars, to which he replied that he had been their vassal, and that they 
had deprived him every year of the flower of what he possessed.       
Discoursing in this manner we reached a village just below the convent, 
where he left me, having first pointed out to me a house of stone with an 
image over the door, which he said once also belonged to the canalla
(rabble) above.
The sun was setting fast, and, eager to reach Villafranca, where I had 
determined on resting and which was still distant three leagues and a half,
I made no halt at this place.       The road was now down a rapid and 
crooked descent which terminated in a valley, at the bottom of which was a 
long and narrow bridge.       Beneath it rolled a river descending from a 
wide pass between two mountains, for the chain was here cleft probably by 
some convulsion of nature.       I looked up the pass and on the hills on 
both sides.       Far above on my right, but standing out bold and clear, 
and catching the last rays of the sun, was        the Convent of the 
Precipices       ; whilst directly over against it, on the further side of 
the valley, rose the perpendicular side of the rival hill which, to a 
considerable extent intercepting the light, flung its black shadow over the
upper end of the pass, involving it in mysterious darkness.       Emerging 
from the centre of this gloom with thundering sound dashed a river, white 
with foam and bearing along with it huge stones and branches of trees, for 
it was the wild Sil, probably at that [time] swollen by the recent rains, 
which I now saw hurrying to the ocean from its cradle in the heart of the 
Asturian hills.       Its fury, its roar, and the savage grandeur of the 
surrounding scenery which was worthy of the pencil of Salvator recalled to 
my mind the powerful lines of Stolberg addressed to a mountain 
torrent       

       The pine-trees are shaken, they yield to thy shocks,
And, crashing, they tumble in wild disarray;
The rocks fly before thee       thou seizest the rocks
And whirlst them, like pebbles, contemptuous away.       

Hours again passed away.       It was now night, and we were in the 
midst of woodlands, feeling our way, for the darkness was so great that I 
could scarcely see the length of a yard before my horse       s head.      
The animal seemed uneasy, and would frequently stop short, prick up his 
ears, and utter a low mournful whine.       Flashes of sheet-lightning 
frequently illumed the black sky and flung a momentary glare over our 
path.       No sound interrupted the stillness of the night save the slow 
tramp of the horses        hoofs, and occasionally the croaking of frogs 
from some pool or morass.       I now bethought me that I was in Spain, the
chosen land of the two fiends, assassination and plunder, and how easily 
two tired unarmed wanderers might become their victims.       We at last 
cleared the woodlands, and after proceeding a short distance the horse gave
a joyous neigh and broke into a smart trot.       A barking of dogs 
speedily reached my ears, and we seemed to be approaching some town or 
village.       In effect we were close to Cacabelos, a town about five 
miles distant from Villafranca.
It was now near eleven at night, and I reflected that it would be far 
more expedient to tarry in this place till the morning than to attempt at 
present to reach Villafranca, exposing ourselves to all the horrors of 
darkness in a lonely and unknown road.       My mind was soon made up on 
this point       but I determined without my hosts, for at the first 
posada which I attempted to enter I was told that we could not be 
accommodated, and particularly our horses, as the stable was full of 
water.       At the second (there were but two), I was answered from the 
window by a gruff voice nearly in the words of Scripture:        Trouble me
not, the gate is already locked, and my servants are also with me in bed; I
cannot arise to let you in.              Indeed we had no particular desire
to enter, as it appeared a wretched hovel; though the poor horses pawed 
piteously against the door, and seemed to crave admittance.
We had now no choice but to resume our doleful way to Villafranca, which
we were told was a short league distant, though it proved a league and a 
half.       We however found it no easy matter to quit the town, for we 
were bewildered amongst its labyrinths and could not find the outlet.      
A lad about eighteen was, however, persuaded by the promise of a 
peseta to guide us, whereupon he led us by many turnings to a bridge
which he told us to cross and to follow the road, which was that of 
Villafranca; he then, having received his fee, hastened from us.
We followed his directions, not, however, without a suspicion that he 
might be deceiving us.       The night had settled darker down upon us, so 
that it was impossible to distinguish any object, however nigh.       The 
lightning had become more faint and rare.       We heard the rustling of 
trees and occasionally the barking of dogs, which last sound, however, soon
ceased, and we were in the midst of night and silence.       My horse, 
either from weariness or the badness of the road, frequently stumbled; 
whereupon I dismounted, and leading him by the bridle, soon left my 
companion far in the rear.       I had proceeded in this manner a 
considerable way when a circumstance occurred of a character well suited to
the time and place.
I was again amidst trees and bushes, when the horse, stopping short, 
nearly pulled me back.       I know not how it was, but fear suddenly came 
over me, which, though in darkness and in solitude, I had not felt 
before.       I was about to urge the animal forward, when I heard a noise 
at my right hand, and listened attentively.       It seemed to be that of a
person or persons forcing their way through branches and brushwood.       
It soon ceased, and I heard feet on the road.       It was the short, 
staggering kind of tread of people carrying a very heavy substance, nearly 
too much for their strength, and I thought I [heard] the hurried breathing 
of men over-fatigued.       There was a short pause in the middle of the 
road; then the stamping recommenced until it reached the other side, when I
again heard a similar rustling amidst branches; it continued for some time,
and died gradually away.
I continued my road, musing on what had just occurred and forming 
conjectures as to the cause.       The lightning resumed its flashing, and 
I saw that I was approaching tall black mountains       But I will omit 
further particulars of this midnight journey.
       Quien vive,        roared a voice about an hour from this 
time, for I had at last groped my way to Villafranca.       It proceeded 
from the sentry at the suburb, one of those singular half soldiers, half 
guerillas, called Miguelets, who are in general employed by the 
Spanish Government to clear the roads of robbers.       I gave the usual 
answer        Espa        a,        and went up to the place where 
he stood.       After a little conversation, I sat down on a stone, 
awaiting the arrival of Antonio, who was long in making his 
appearance.       On his arrival I asked him if any one had passed him on 
the road, but he replied that he had seen nothing.       The night, or 
rather morning, was still very dark, though a small corner of the moon was 
occasionally visible.       On our enquiring the way to the gate, the 
Miguelet directed us down a street to the left, which we followed.       
The street was steep, we could see no gate, and our progress was soon 
stopped by houses and wall.       We knocked at the gates of two or three 
of these houses (in the upper stories of which lights were burning) for the
purpose of being set right, but we were either disregarded or not 
heard.       A horrid squalling of cats from the tops of the houses and 
dark corners saluted our ears, and I thought of the night-arrival of Don 
Quixote and his squire at Tobosa, and their vain search amongst the 
deserted streets for the palace of Dulcinea.       At length we saw light 
and heard voices in a cottage at the further side of a kind of ditch.      
Leading the horses over, we called at the door, which was opened by an aged
man, who appeared by his dress to be a baker, as indeed he proved, which 
accounted for his being up at so late an hour.       On begging him to show
us the way into the town, he led us up a very narrow alley at the end of 
his cottage, saying that he would likewise conduct us to the 
posada.       The alley led directly to what appeared to be the 
market-place, at a corner house of which our guide stopped and 
knocked.       After a long pause an upper window was opened, and a female 
voice demanded who we were.       The old man replied that two travellers 
had arrived who were in need of lodging.              I cannot be disturbed
at this time of night,        said the woman,        they will be wanting 
supper, and there is nothing in the house; they must go 
elsewhere.              She was going to shut the window, but I cried that 
we wanted no supper, but merely a resting-place for ourselves and horses, 
that we had come that day from Astorga, and were dying with fatigue.       
       Who is that speaking?        cried the woman.              Surely 
that is the voice of Gil, the German clock-maker from Pontevedra.       
Welcome, old companion, you are come at the right time, for my own is out 
of order.       I am sorry I kept you waiting, but I will admit you in a 
moment.       
The window was slammed to; presently light shone through the crevices if
the door, a key turned in the lock, and we were admitted.

Saint James ( span 
class="smcap">Santiago) of 
Compostella,
19th Aug. [1837].
Revd. and dear Sir,       I left Corunna 
about ten days since for this town, travelling with the courier or weekly 
post, who was escorted by a strong party of soldiers in consequence of the 
distracted state of the country.       Nothing particular worth relating 
occurred during the journey, which occupied a day and a half, though the 
distance is barely ten leagues.       Santiago, or Saint James, is, as you 
are aware, the capital of Galicia, and the residence of the 
Metropolitan.       It is, or was, the most celebrated resort for pilgrims 
in the whole world, with the exception of Jerusalem, as it is said to 
contain the bones of Saint James the Elder, the Child of the Thunder, who 
according to the legend of the Roman Church first preached the Gospel in 
Spain.       The cathedral, though built at various periods and by no means
uniform, is a majestic, venerable edifice, in every respect calculated to 
excite awe and admiration; indeed it is almost impossible to walk its long 
dusky aisles and hear the solemn music and the noble chanting and inhale 
the incense of the mighty censers, which are at times swung so high by 
machinery that they smite the vaulted roof, whilst gigantic tapers glitter 
here and there amongst the gloom from the shrine of many a saint, before 
which the worshippers are kneeling, breathing forth their prayers and 
petitions for help, love, and mercy, and entertain a doubt that we are 
treading the floor of a house where God delighteth to dwell.       Yet the 
Lord is distant from that house.       He heareth not, He seeth not: or, if
He hear and see, it is with anger.       What availeth that solemn music, 
that noble chanting, that incense of sweet savour?       What availeth 
kneeling before that grand altar of silver, surmounted by that figure with 
its silver hat and breastplate, the emblem of one who, although an Apostle 
and Confessor, was at best an unprofitable servant?       What availeth 
hoping for remission of sin by trusting in the merits of him who possessed 
none, or by paying homage to others who were born and nurtured in sin, and 
who alone by the exercise of a lively faith granted from above could hope 
to preserve themselves from the wrath of the Almighty?       Yet such acts 
and formalities constitute what is termed religion at Compostella, where, 
perhaps, God and His will are less known and respected than at Pekin or 
amid the wildernesses where graze the coursers of the Mongol and the 
Mandchou.       Perhaps there is no part of Spain where the Romish religion
is so cherished as throughout Galicia.       In no part of Spain are the 
precepts and ordinances of that Church, especially fasting and confession, 
so strictly observed, and its ministers regarded with so much respect and 
deference.       The natural conclusion therefore would be that, if the 
religion of Rome be the same as that founded by Christ, the example of the 
Saviour is more closely followed, and the savage and furious passions more 
bridled, bloodshed and rapine less frequent, unchastity and intemperance 
less apparent, and the minds of the people more enlightened and free from 
the mists of superstition in Galicia than in other provinces.
What is the fact?       Almost every road is teeming with banditti, who 
under the name of Carlists plunder friend and foe, and to robbery join 
cruelty so atrociously horrible that indignation at the crime is frequently
lost in wonder; for the Galician robbers are seldom satisfied with booty, 
and unlike their brethren in other parts generally mutilate or assassinate 
those who are so unfortunate as to fall in their hands; prostitution is 
carried on to an enormous extent, and although loathsome concustant [sic] 
diseases stare the stranger in the face in the street, in the market-place,
in the church, and at the fountain;        Drunken as a Galician        is 
a proverb; and superstitions forgotten, abandoned in the rest of Spain, are
clung to here with surprising pertinacity, the clergy exerting themselves 
to uphold them by carrying on a very extensive sale in charms, verifying 
the old saying,        Witches are found where friars abound.       
An unhappy man, whilst collecting vipers amongst the hills, which he was
in the practice of selling to the apothecaries, was lately met near Orense 
by some of these monsters.       Having plundered and stripped him, they 
tied his hands behind him and thrust his head into the sack, which 
contained several of these horrible reptiles alive!       They then 
fastened the sack at the mouth round his neck, and having feasted their 
ears for a time with his cries, they abandoned him to his fate.       The 
poor wretch, stung by the vipers in the face and eyes, presently became mad
and ran through several villages, till he fell dead.
I am now in the heart of this strange country and people.       It has 
pleased the Lord to bless my humble endeavours more than I had reason to 
expect; since my arrival Santiago between thirty and forty copies of the 
New Testament have been despatched.       The bookseller of the place, Rey 
Romero, a venerable man of seventy, very wealthy and respected, has taken 
up the cause with an enthusiasm which doubtless emanates from on high, 
losing no opportunity of recommending the work to those who enter his shop,
which is very splendid and commodious.
In many instances, when the peasants of the neighbourhood have come with
the intention of purchasing some of the foolish popular story-books of 
Spain, he has persuaded them in lieu thereof to carry home Testaments, 
assuring them that it was not only a better and more instructive, but even 
a far more entertaining book than those they came in quest of.       He has
taken a great fancy to me, and comes to visit me every evening, when he 
accompanies me in my walks about the town and environs.       Every one who
is aware how rare it is to meet with friendship and cordiality in Spain 
will easily conceive my joy at finding such a coadjutor, and I have no 
doubt that when I am absent he will exert himself as much, and I hope as 
effectually, as now that I am present.
I leave Saint James to-morrow for Pontevedra and Vigo, carrying with me 
some Testaments which I hope to dispose of, notwithstanding there are no 
booksellers in those places.       I shall then return to Corunna, either 
by Compostella or by some other route.       I trust the Lord will preserve
me in this journey as He has done in others.       From Corunna I propose 
to travel through the mountains to Oviedo in the Asturias, provided that 
town be not speedily in the hands of the factious.       By the time these 
lines reach you, you will doubtless have heard of the irruption of a part 
of the Pretender       s hordes into Old Castile; they have carried 
everything before them, and have sacked and taken possession of the city of
Segovia, distant only one day       s march from Madrid.       From the 
aspect of things I should say that the miseries of this land, far from 
having reached their climax, are but commencing.       Yet let no one mourn
for Egypt: she is but paying the price of her sorceries and 
superstitions.
(Unsigned.)
P.S.       At San Sebastian I shall need Davison       s Turkish 
Grammar, which you have in the Library.       It will be of assistance to 
me in editing the Basque St. Luke; the two languages are surprisingly 
connected.

Corunna, Sep. 15, 1837.
Revd. and dear Sir,       About ten days have
elapsed since my return to Corunna.       I stated in my last letter, from 
Compostella, that it was my intention to visit Pontevedra and Vigo, which I
carried into effect.       In the first of these places I left, as I passed
through, eight copies of the New Testament in the hands of Se        or 
Garcia, the public notary; three days subsequent, on my return, I found 
that he had disposed of them, and I have since sent him a fresh 
supply.       He is a very zealous and exceeding intelligent person, and I 
have no doubt will prove a highly useful agent in Pontevedra and its 
beautiful neighbourhood, which is the garden of Galicia.       In Vigo I 
disposed of four Testaments, but was not so fortunate as to find any person
willing or calculated to undertake the charge accepted by my friend in the 
former town.
Having reached Padron, in my journey back, I sent my servant and horses 
forward to Saint James, and guided by a peasant, proceeded across the 
country to Cape Finisterre, on whose rocky sides I so narrowly escaped 
being shipwrecked last year.       The distance was fifteen leagues, and 
the route lay over wild mountains and valleys, where we suffered much from 
fatigue and the heat of the sun.       Arrived at Finisterre we were seized
as Carlist spies by the fishermen of the place, who determined at first on 
shooting us, but at last contented themselves with conducting us prisoners 
to Corcubion, where the Alcalde of the district, after having 
examined me and perused my passport, ordered me to be set at liberty, and 
treated me with all manner of civility.       By this journey I 
accomplished what has long been one of the ardent wishes of my heart.      
I have carried the Gospel to the extreme point of the old world, having 
left a Testament in the hands of Antonio de Trava, an ancient mariner of 
Finisterre, who took my part in a very friendly manner, and probably saved 
me from experiencing much violence at the hands of his companions.       
Finisterre is a place of wonders, which I hope at some future time to have 
the pleasure of narrating; but at present I must speak of other 
matters.       About one hundred Testaments have been disposed of at Saint 
James of Compostella, and there is at present a steady regular demand for 
them there which inspires my heart with gratitude to the Almighty.       
Shortly previous to my journey to Saint James, I despatched fifty copies to
Lugo, where the Lord vouchsafed me good success on a former occasion; this 
second supply being almost exhausted, I have sent more.       Only 
fifty-eight copies have hitherto been sold at Corunna, for its inhabitants 
are far too much engrossed by party politics to entertain much relish for 
heavenly manna.       I pray every night and morning that their eyes may be
opened to their eternal welfare.
Having now arranged matters in Galicia, as well as circumstances will 
permit, I am about to quit this province, directing my course to Oviedo in 
the Asturias.       The way is long, and is infested by robbers and 
factious; yet I go forth without much fear, hoping that the Lord will prove
my shield and guard as on other occasions.       From Oviedo I proceed to 
Santander, and from thence to the Basque provinces.       Santander, being 
a large and flourishing town, affords me a tolerable prospect of success, 
and I have accordingly directed my agent at Madrid to despatch thither 
forthwith 150 Testaments.       The intermediate country is, however, in a 
most distracted state, a great part of it being in the hands of the 
Carlists; it is therefore probable that the books may never reach me, in 
which event I shall have to apply to England.       To the Basque provinces
I hope to carry Saint Luke in a Biscayan version, which I shall print at 
Santander should an opportunity present itself.
No time must be lost in accomplishing all that is possible in Spain, 
which in the course of a few months may be entirely in the hands of the 
Pretender.       I received the lines which you directed to the care of the
British consul at Corunna, and was thankful for them.       Pray present my
kind remembrances to Mrs. Brandram and family, to Mr. Jowett, and Mr. and 
Mrs. Browne.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. Borrow.

Oviedo, Asturias, 29 
Septr. 1837.
Revd. and dear Sir,       A day or two after 
the date of my last letter I quitted Corunna and passed over the bay to 
Ferrol, where I left twenty Testaments in the hands of a person who has 
just established a small book-shop in that place.       My servant Antonio 
went round by land with my horse, the only one which I now possess, I 
having disposed  a href="#footnote251" 
class="citation">[251] of the largest of the two at Corunna, as I 
thought he was unable to support the fatigue of a journey to Oviedo.       
At Ferrol I hired a horse and guide as far as Ribadeo, a distance of twenty
leagues, and somewhat less than half the way to Oviedo.       This journey 
was a terrible one; during the greatest part of it we had to toil up and 
down mountain gorges and ravines, to force our way through bushes and 
thickets, and to wade rivulets and torrents swollen by the rain, which 
descended continually; our guide proved perfectly ignorant of the country, 
and we had to bribe various peasants to accompany us, though we incurred 
great risk by so doing of being conducted to some den of thieves, and 
stripped and murdered.       At Ribadeo we procured a fresh horse and 
guide, and continued our way to Oviedo, encountering still greater 
difficulties, the ground being still more rugged and broken than that which
we had previously passed over.       My own horse rolled down a precipice, 
and was much maimed, whilst that of the guide was so worn out by the time 
he reached Gijon, four leagues from Oviedo, that he foundered.       As for
Antonio and myself, we arrived barefooted and bleeding, for I need scarcely
say that during all this journey, which amounted at least to 130 miles, we 
went on foot, the poor horses being scarcely able to carry our books and 
baggage.
I am now by the blessing of the Almighty in the city of Oviedo, the 
capital of the Asturias, although at an unpropitious season, for the bray 
of war is at the gate, and there is the cry of the captains and the 
shouting.       Castile is at the present time in the hands of the 
Carlists, who have captured and plundered Valladolid, in much the same 
manner as they did Segovia.       They are every day expected to march on 
this place, in which case they will probably experience an obstinate 
resistance, very excellent redoubts having been erected, and several of the
convents strongly fortified, especially that of Santa Clara de la 
Vega.       All minds here are at present in a state of feverish anxiety 
and suspense, more especially as no intelligence at present arrives from 
Madrid, which by the last accounts was beleaguered by the bands of Cabrera,
Palillos, and Orejita.       But I am interrupted, and I lay down my 
pen.
A strange adventure has just occurred to me.       I am in the ancient 
town of Oviedo, in a very large, scantily furnished and remote room of an 
ancient posada, formerly a palace of the Counts of Santa Cruz.      
It is past ten at night and the rain is descending in torrents.       I 
ceased writing on hearing numerous footsteps ascending the creaking stairs 
which lead to my apartment       the door was flung open, and in walked 
nine men of tall stature, marshalled by a little hunch-backed 
personage.       They were all muffled in the long cloaks of Spain, but I 
instantly knew by their demeanour that they were caballeros, or 
gentlemen.       They placed themselves in a rank before the table where I 
was sitting; suddenly and simultaneously they all flung back their cloaks, 
and I perceived that every one bore a book in his hand, a book which I knew
full well.       After a pause, which I was unable to break, for I sat lost
in astonishment and almost conceived myself to be visited by apparitions, 
the hunch-back advancing somewhat before the rest said in soft silvery 
tones:        Se        or Cavalier, was it you who brought this 
book to the Asturias?              I now supposed that they were the civil 
authorities of the place come to take me into custody, and rising from my 
seat I exclaimed,        It certainly was I, and it is my glory to have 
done so.       The book is the New Testament of God; I wish it was in my 
power to bring a million.                     I heartily wish so 
too,        said the little personage with a sigh.              Be under no
apprehension, Sir Cavalier; these gentlemen are my friends.       We have 
just purchased these books in the shop where you have placed them for sale,
and have taken the liberty of calling upon you in order to return you our 
thanks for the treasure you have brought us.       I hope you can furnish 
us with the Old Testament also.              I replied that I was sorry to 
inform him that at present it was entirely out of my power to comply with 
his wish, as I had no Old Testaments in my possession, but did not despair 
of procuring some speedily, from England.       He then asked me a great 
many questions concerning my Biblical travels in Spain, and my success, and
the views entertained by the Society in respect to Spain, adding that he 
hoped I should pay particular attention to the Asturias, which he assured 
me was the best ground in the Peninsula for our labour.       After about 
half-an-hour       s conversation, he suddenly said in the English 
language,        Good night, sir,        wrapped his cloak around him, and 
walked out as he had come.       His companions, who had hitherto not 
uttered a word, all repeated,        Good night, sir,        and adjusting 
their cloaks followed him.
In order to explain this strange scene I must inform you that this 
morning I visited the petty bookseller of the place, Longoria, and having 
arranged preliminaries with him I sent him in the evening a package of 
forty Testaments, all I possess, with some advertisements.       At the 
time he assured me that, though he was willing to undertake the sale, there
was nevertheless not a prospect of success, as a whole month had elapsed 
since he had sold a book of any description, on account of the uncertainty 
of the times and the poverty which pervaded the land.       I therefore sat
down to write this letter much dispirited; this incident has, however, 
admonished me not to be cast down when things look gloomiest, as the hand 
of the Lord is generally then most busy: that men may learn to perceive 
that whatever good is accomplished is not theirs but His.
I shall quit Oviedo in a few days, but whither I shall now direct my 
course I have not determined.       It would be easy for me to reach 
Santander, which is but thirty leagues [distant] and the road tolerably 
free from accidents; but the state of affairs at Madrid gives me 
considerable uneasiness, for I remember that Madrid is the dep       t of 
our books, and I am apprehensive that in the revolutions and disturbances 
which at present seem to threaten it, our whole stock may perish.       
True it is that in order to reach Madrid I should have to pass through the 
midst of the Carlist hordes, who would perhaps slay or make me prisoner; 
but I am at present so much accustomed to perilous adventure, and have 
hitherto experienced so many fortunate escapes, that the dangers which 
infest the route would not deter me a moment from venturing.       But 
there is no certain intelligence, and Madrid may be in safety or on the 
brink of falling; perhaps a few hours will inform us, when I shall at once 
decide.       My next letter will therefore be either from Santander or the
capital of Spain.
Oviedo is picturesquely situated between two mountains, Morcin and 
Naranco; the former is very high and ragged, and during the greatest part 
of the year is covered with snow; the sides of the latter are cultivated 
and planted with vines.       The town itself possesses nothing very 
remarkable with the exception of the cathedral, the tower of which is very 
high, and is perhaps the purest specimen of Gothic architecture at present 
in existence.       The interior of the edifice is neat and appropriate but
simple and unadorned, for I observed but one picture, the Conversion of St.
Paul.       One of the chapels is a cemetery, in which rest the bones of 
eleven Gothic kings, whose souls I trust in Christ have been accepted.
I will now conclude in the words of Heber:

       From Greenland       s icy mountains,
From India       s coral strand       
Where Afric       s sunny fountains
Roll down the yellow sand       
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error       s chain.       

Most truly yours,
G. B.
P.S.       Morning [Sept.] 30th, twenty Testaments have been

Revd. and dear Sir,       In my last letter, 
from Oviedo in the Asturias, I stated that my next would be dated either 
from Santander or the capital of Spain.       I arrived yesterday at 
Madrid, but I previously visited Santander, which I reached with my usual 
good fortune, without accident, after a fatiguing journey of six 
days.       When there, I found to my great sorrow that the two hundred 
Testaments which I had ordered to be sent from Madrid were not come; and I 
supposed that they had either been seized on the way by the Carlists or 
that my letter had miscarried.  a 
href="#footnote256" class="citation">[256]       I then thought of 
applying to England for a supply, but I abandoned the idea for two reasons;
first, that I should have to remain idly loitering at Santander for at 
least a month before I could receive them       a place where every article
is so dear that my expenses with the strictest economy would have amounted 
to nearly two pounds per diem; secondly, that I was very unwell, and
unable to procure medical advice at Santander: for, to tell the truth, ever
since I left Corunna I have been afflicted with a terrible dysentery, and 
latterly with an ophthalmia, the result of the other malady.
I therefore determined on returning to Madrid.       To effect this, 
however, seemed almost impossible.       Parties of the army of Don Carlos,
which in a partial degree had been routed in Castile, were hovering about 
the country through which I should have to pass, more especially that part 
called        The Mountains,        so that all communication had ceased 
between Santander and the southern districts.       Nevertheless I 
determined to trust, as usual, in the Almighty and to venture.       I 
purchased, therefore, a small horse and sallied forth with Antonio, 
notwithstanding I was so unwell as to be scarcely able to support 
myself.       I wished to have written to you from Santander, but I was 
exceedingly dispirited and could not collect my thoughts.       Before 
departing, I of course entered into conference with the booksellers as to 
what they should do in the event of my finding an opportunity of sending 
them a stock of Testaments from Madrid, and having arranged things to my 
satisfaction I committed myself to Providence.       I will not dwell long 
on this journey of three hundred miles.       We were in the midst of the 
fire, yet, strange to say, escaped without a hair being singed; robberies, 
murders, and all kinds of atrocity were perpetrated before, behind, and on 
both sides of us, but not so much as a dog barked at us, though in 
one instance a plan had been laid to intercept us.       About four leagues
from Santander, whilst we were baiting our horses at a village hostelry, I 
saw a fellow run off after having held a whispering conversation with a boy
who was dealing out barley to us.       I instantly enquired of the latter 
what the man had said to him, but only obtained an evasive answer.       It
appeared afterwards that the conversation was about ourselves.       Two or
three leagues further on there was an inn and village, where we had 
proposed staying, and indeed had expressed our intention of doing so; but 
on arriving there, finding that the sun was still far from its bourn, I 
determined to proceed further, expecting to find a resting-place at the 
distance of a league; though I was mistaken, finding none until we reached 
Montaneda, nine leagues and a half from Santander, where was stationed a 
small detachment of soldiers.       At the dead of night we were aroused 
from our sleep by a cry that the        factious        were not far 
off.       A messenger had arrived from the Alcalde of the village 
where we had previously intended staying, who stated that a party of 
Carlists had just surprised that place, and were searching for an English 
spy whom they supposed to be at the inn.       The officer commanding the 
soldiers, upon hearing this, not deeming his own situation a safe one, 
instantly drew off his men, falling back on a stronger party stationed in a
fortified village near at hand; as for ourselves we saddled our horses and 
continued our way in the dark.       Had the Carlists succeeded in 
apprehending me, I should instantly have been shot, and my body cast on the
rocks to feed the vultures and wolves.       But        it was not so 
written              said my man, who is a Greek and a fatalist.       The 
next night we had another singular escape; we had arrived near the entrance
of a horrible pass, called El puerto de la puente de las tablas, or 
the pass of the bridge of planks, which wound through a black and frightful
mountain, on the further side of which was the town of O        as, where 
we meant to tarry for the night.       The sun had set about a quarter of 
an hour.       Suddenly a man with his face covered with blood rushed out 
of the pass.       Turn back, sir,        he said,        in the name of 
God; there are murderers in that pass; they have just robbed me of my mule 
and all I possess, and I have hardly escaped with life from their 
hands.              I scarcely can say why, but I made him no answer, and 
proceeded; indeed I was so weary and unwell that I cared not what became of
me.       We entered       the rocks rose perpendicularly right and left, 
entirely intercepting the scanty twilight, so that the darkness of the 
grave, or rather the blackness of the valley of the shadow of death, 
reigned around us, and we knew not where we went, but trusted solely to the
instinct of the horses, who moved on with their heads close to the 
ground.       The only sound which we heard was the splash of a stream 
which tumbled down the pass.       I expected every moment to feel a knife 
at my throat, but       it was not so written.       We threaded the
pass without meeting a human being, and within three quarters of an hour 
after the time we entered it, we found ourselves within the posada 
of the town of O        as, which was filled with troops and armed peasants
expecting an attack from the grand Carlist army, which was near at 
hand.
Well! we reached Burgos in safety, we reached Valladolid in safety, we 
passed the Guadarama in safety, and now we are safely housed in 
Madrid.       People say we have been very lucky; Antonio says,        It 
was so written       ; but I say,        Glory be to the Lord for His 
mercies vouchsafed.       
I did not find matters in a very prosperous state in Madrid.       Few 
copies of the New Testament have been sold; yet what else could be 
rationally expected in these latter times?       Don Carlos with a large 
army has been at the gates; plunder and massacre were expected, and people 
have been too much occupied in planning to secure their lives and property 
to have much time to devote to reading of any description.       I have had
an interview with Dr. Usoz, and have just received a most interesting 
letter from him, replete with patriotism and piety; amongst other things he
says,        only circumstances and the public poverty are the cause of the
works not having met with sale at Madrid.              Of this letter I 
shall send a translation.       It contains some remarks respecting Father 
Scio       s version, which I consider to be of high importance, and humbly
recommend to the attention of the Committee.
But I am at present in Madrid, and am thus enabled to superintend in 
person the measures calculated to secure the sale of the work.       I 
shall forthwith cause a thousand advertisements to be printed and affixed 
from time to time in every part of the city.       I shall likewise employ 
colporteurs to vend them in the streets, and shall perhaps establish a 
stall or small shop, where Testaments and Testaments alone will be 
sold.       No exertion of which I am capable will be spared, and if 
       the Word of the Lord        become not speedily better known at 
Madrid, it will be because the Lord in His inscrutable wisdom does not so 
will it.
Whilst in the northern provinces I ordered a hundred copies to be 
despatched from Madrid to each of the three great towns, Valencia, Seville,
and Cadiz, with advertisements; I am glad to be able to state that advice 
has been received that the books have reached their destination.       At 
the commencement of the coming year it is my intention to visit those 
parts; for no work seems to prosper in Spain which is not closely attended 
to by the master.       Whilst at Valladolid I ordered all the copies which
remained unsold of the second supply to be sent to Burgos, and I am now 
going to despatch a third fifty to the former town, and a still larger 
quantity to Oviedo, those which I carried thither having been all sold 
during my short stay.
In a few days it is my intention to commit to the press Luke in Basque 
and in Rommany, the latter of which versions I propose to carry with me to 
Andalusia and Valencia, the two provinces which most abound with the 
Rommany-Chai, of whom, by the way, I found no trace in Old Castile, 
Galicia, or the Asturias.       As for the Basque version, it is probable 
that even in Madrid it will not be without demand, as many Biscayans 
residing there will doubtless be eager to read the Gospel when placed 
within their reach in their native tongue.
I will now conclude by begging pardon for all errors of commission and 
omission.       I am a frail foolish vessel, and have accomplished but a 
slight portion of what I proposed in my vanity.       Yet something, though
but little, has been effected by this journey, which I have just brought to
a conclusion.       The New Testament of Christ is enjoying a quiet sale in
the principal towns of the north of Spain, and I have secured the 
friendly interest and co-operation of the booksellers of those 
parts, particularly him, the most considerable of them all, Rey Romero of 
Compostella.       I have, moreover, by private sale disposed of one 
hundred and sixteen Testaments to individuals entirely of the lower 
classes, namely, muleteers, carmen, contrabandistas, etc.
My accounts will follow in a few days.       Now may the Lord bless you,
and dispose you to pray for myself and all in this land of misery and 
sorrow.

Revd. and dear Sir,       On the other side 
you have an account of the money which I expended during my journey, and 
also of what I have laid out in the Society       s service since my 
return.       In respect to my expenses, I wish to state that most articles
are very dear in Spain, especially in the parts where I have travelled, and
that I have been subjected to many expenses which I have not specified in 
the account, for example the gate-dues for the books, in every town where I
have introduced them       the printing of advertisements       and 
particularly farriers        bills, as the poor horses were continually 
ailing from over-work, bad provender and falls received amongst the 
mountains.       In the account of Testaments sold you will observe that I 
make no mention of by far the greater number, namely those disposed of at 
Lugo, Saint James, etc., etc., as I have not yet received the money from 
the booksellers.       About a week since I received advice from Leon that 
the forty copies which I had left there had been all sold, and that the 
money was in readiness; I have despatched a fresh supply of fifty to that 
important town, where last summer I nearly lost my life in a burning 
fever.       I am expecting every day a fresh order from Salamanca, and 
hope that, as the circle widens in the lake into which a stripling has cast
a pebble, so will the circle of our usefulness continue widening until it 
has embraced the whole vast region of Spain.
I have delayed writing for nearly a fortnight, as during that period I 
have been looking out for a suitable shop in which to commence operations 
in Madrid.       I have just found one quite to my mind, situated in the 
Calle del Principe, one of the principal streets.       The rent, it
is true, is rather high (eight reals per diem); but a good 
situation, as you are well aware, must be paid for.       I came to the 
resolution of establishing a shop from finding that the Madrid booksellers 
entrusted with the Testaments gave themselves no manner of trouble to 
secure the sale, and even withheld advertisements from the public with 
which they were supplied.       But now everything will be on another 
footing, and I have sanguine hopes of selling all that remain of the 
edition within a short time.
A violent and furious letter against the Bible Society and its 
proceedings has lately appeared in a public print; it is prefixed to a 
Pastoral of the Spiritual Governor [i.e. Bishop] of Valencia, in 
which he forbids the sale of the London Bible in that see.       About a 
week since I inserted in the Espa        ol an answer to that 
letter, which answer has been read and praised.       I send you herewith 
an English translation of it.       You will doubtless deem it too warm and
fiery, but tameness and gentleness are of little avail when surrounded by 
the vassal slaves of bloody Rome.       It has answered one 
purpose       it has silenced our antagonist, who, it seems, is an 
unprincipled benefice-hunting curate.       As you read Spanish, I have 
copied his own words respecting the omission of the Apocrypha; 
nevertheless, lest you should find some difficulty in understanding it, I 
subjoin here the English.
       If the works of Luther were to be given to the world curtailed of
their principal chapters, and his maxims and precepts to a certain 
degree transformed, what would his followers and disciples do?       Would 
they not rise with one accord in numerous bands, and, in order to sustain 
the honour of their preceptor, would they not recur to the original 
writings and produce in his support his manuscripts?       Would they not 
resort to all kinds of argument to prove the spuriousness of that edition, 
and employ declamation and reasoning in order to blacken the illicit and 
fraudulent means which the Catholics were employing?        etc., etc., 
etc.
I deemed it my duty, as Agent of the Bible Society in Spain, not to 
permit so brutal an attack upon it to pass unanswered.       Indeed I was 
called upon by my friends to reply, and though I am adverse to all 
theological and political disputes, I feared to refuse, lest the motives of
my silence should be misconstrued.       But now I must be permitted to say
(between ourselves) that it was a very unadvised act to send such a Bible 
as the London one over to Spain, a Bible which does the editor no credit 
and the Society less; and it was a still more unadvised act to advertise in
the prints of Valencia that it would be given gratis to the 
poor.       Mr. Villiers, whom I consulted, made use of these words: 
       How is it possible for you (meaning myself) to sell books at Madrid 
and other places, when it becomes known that those very same books are 
being given away at Valencia?       Moreover, giving away Bibles to the 
multitude will seem to imply that there is some plot or conspiracy in the 
wind, and the Government, with some shadow of reason, may be called upon to
interfere, and the proceedings of the Society may be brought to a sudden 
stop in Spain.              I hope you will excuse these hints; they are 
well meant, and in uttering them I have, as you know, the prosperity of our
hallowed cause solely at heart.

(I am still very unwell.)
To the Editors of El Espa        ol
Gentlemen,       My attention has this moment
been directed by a friend to a letter which appeared in your journal of the
5th instant, signed Jose Francisco Garcia and prefixed to a circular of the
Governor of the See of Valencia, the object of which is to forbid the 
purchasing or reading of the Castilian version of the Bible by Father 
Felipe Scio, as edited in London by the British and Foreign Bible Society, 
and which the Agent of the Society at Valencia has announced for sale.
Did the principles of the Bible Society permit them to rejoice at the 
misfortunes of their fellow-creatures, even of their enemies, the style and
tone which the writer of this epistle has, unfortunately for himself and 
his cause, adopted, would afford them plenteous matter for 
congratulation.       He calls himself an ecclesiastic and talks about 
       the sacred duty of his august ministry,        and for the purpose, 
I suppose, of showing how strictly he fulfils the precepts of his mild 
Master and Redeemer, he styles the Society in question        an infernal 
Society,        and speaks of        its accursed fecundity.              
Goodly words!       Charitable words!       May I be permitted to enquire 
in what part of the sacred writings he found them recommended?       
Perhaps in the following text of the Vulgate:       

       V        vobis Scrib        et Pharis       i hypocrit       , 
qui decimatis mentham, et anethum, et cyminum, et reliquistis qu        
graviora sunt legis, judicium, et misericordiam, et 
fidem.       H       c oportuit facere, et illa non omittere.       
Matt. cap. xxiii. vers. 23.
Ay de vosotros, Escribas y Pharis        os hip        critas, que 
diezmais la yerba buena, y el eneldo, y el comino, y habeis dexado las 
cosas, que son mas importantes de la Ley, la justicia, y la 
misericordia, y la f        !       Esto era menester hacer, y no dexar
lo otro.

The British and Foreign Bible Society is an infernal society and 
consequently its members, one and all, are children of the devil.       
Now, what is required to constitute a child of the devil, according to the 
opinion of the Founder of Christianity       of Jesus       the Living 
Word       the Eternal God?       Let me quote His own words, 
according to the Vulgate, the book of the Church of Rome:

       Vos ex patre diabolo estis: et desideria patris vestri vultis 
facere.       Ille homicida erat ab initio, et in veritate non stetit, quia
non est veritas in eo: cum loquitur mendacium, ex propriis loquitur, quia 
mendax est et pater ejus.       
Joan. cap. viii. vers. 44.
       Vosotros sois hijos del diablo, y quereis cumplir los deseos de 
vuestro padre:         l fu         homicida desde el principio, y no 
permaneci         en la verdad; porque no hay verdad en         l: quando 
habla mentira, de suyo habla; porque es mentiroso, y padre de la 
mentira.       

By this it should appear that the infernal Bible Society by the 
propagation of the Scriptures merely fulfils the desire of its father the 
devil, and disseminates that which is his.       Being a child of the devil
it cannot propagate truth; it propagates the Gospel, and nothing 
else       ergo, the Gospel is a lie and the father of it the 
devil.
But the Bible Society is accused, not only in the circular, but in the 
epistle which introduces it to the Espa        ol, of vending a 
mutilated and curtailed version of the holy books.       It is accused of 
omitting six of the books which are generally bound up with what is 
denominated the Bible; viz., Tobias, Judith, Baruch, Sabiduria, 
Eclesiastico, y 1      y 2      de los Machabeos.       The Christian 
ecclesiastic, the author of the epistle, in indignation at this 
omission becomes suddenly argumentative, and puts a case to the heretics, 
which he deems in point;        Si vieran la luz p       blica las obras de
Lutero mutiladas en sus principales cap        tulos, y 
transformadas en cierto modo sus m        ximas y preceptos; que 
diligencias no practicarian sus secuaces y discipulos?       Se levantarian
         una en tropas numerosas para sostener el honor de su preceptor, y 
con el fin de dejar en su justo lugar          su amado maestre, 
recurririan          sus escritos originales, manifestarian en su apoyo los
manuscritos, apelarian          todo linage de argumentos para acreditar la
ilegitimidad de aquella edicion, y emplearian sus declamaciones y 
raciocinios para ascar los medios rateres          ilicitos de que se valia
el catolicismo.       
Hear it in Gath! hear it in Gilead! hear it on the hills of Israel! yea 
let the furthest corners of the earth hear it!       The principal 
chapters of the Bible are not those of the New Testament, which 
contains the will and words of the Saviour, by whom we are to be 
judged       not those of Isaiah, who foretold so beautifully and 
distinctly the coming of that Saviour to the world       not those of 
Moses, who wrote of things in their earliest date, and so nobly depicted 
the progress of the creation,       but those of the books of Tobit, 
Baruch, etc., books which the Roman Church itself has called apocryphal, 
and the greater part of which exhibit an internal character of spuriousness
which precludes the possibility of their being the offspring of inspired 
minds, though they contain some things useful and instructive, such as may 
be found in the writings of the early doctors, who however never claimed 
nor were deemed to possess the gift of inspiration from on high.
Let me here ask: what is to be discovered in the chapters of Tobit, 
etc., of first rate importance to the Christian in his worldly pilgrimage, 
or which serves to corroborate and illustrate other parts of 
Scripture?       Above all, is Christ crucified spoken of or hinted at, as 
in the authenticated writings of the Prophets?       If not, what is their 
value in comparison with that of other books of Scripture, even could their
authenticity be proved?
Now to that point.       This Christian ecclesiastic calls with a loud 
voice upon his brethren to prove by pamphlets and writing the divinity of 
the books of Tobit, Judith, etc.       Yea, let them accomplish 
that       let them bring sufficient evidence that these apocryphal 
writings were held in veneration by the Jews, that they enjoyed a place in 
the sanctuary along with the inspired writings, let them show that they 
were penned by Prophets, above all let them produce the 
originals       and the Bible Society will immediately admit them into 
its editions.       Why not?       I am not aware that one point of 
doctrine, either Protestant or Roman, depends upon their reception or 
rejection.
In conclusion.       What struck me most on the perusal of this singular
epistle, all the main points of which I believe I have tolerably well 
answered, and without much trouble, was the ignorance more than childish, 
the extraordinary, unaccountable ignorance, which the author displays on 
the subject on which he has written, and all which relates to it, 
notwithstanding that subject is a religious one, and he, an ecclesiastic as
he gives the world to know, standing forward as champion of the Church of 
Rome.       He is evidently as well acquainted with Scripture and the works
of the Fathers as with the Talmud and Zend-avesta, and with the ideas and 
dogmas of those whom he calls heretics, as with the religious opinions of 
the Mongols and the followers of the Lama of the Himalayan hills.       The
miserable attack which, in his rancorous feebleness, he has just committed 
on the Bible Society will redound merely to his own shame and ridicule, and
the disgrace of the sect to which he belongs.       What could persuade him
to speak of the Vulgate?       What could induce him to grasp that 
two-edged sword?       Does it not cut off his own hands?       Does the 
Vulgate allude to the Bible Society, or to him and his fellows, when it 
cries:       

Vae vobis legisperitis, quia tulistis clavem scienti       , ipsi non 
introistis: et eos, qui introibant, prohibuistis.       Luc       , cap. 
xi. vers. 52.
       Ay de vosotros, Doctores de la Ley que os alz        steis con la
llave de la ciencia! vosotros no entr        steis, y habeis prohibido 
         los que entraban.       

And again:       

Qui ex Deo est, verba Dei audit.       Propterea vos non auditis, quia 
ex Deo non estis.       Joan. cap. viii. vers. 47.
       El que es de Dios, oye las palabras de Dios.       Por eso 
vosotros no las ois, porque no sois de Dios.       

What could induce him to speak of Luther and his works?       What does 
he, what do his abettors, know of Luther and his writings, or of the ideas 
which the heretics entertain respecting either?       I will instruct 
them.       Luther was a bold inquiring man, with some learning; he read 
the Scriptures in the original tongues, and found that their contents were 
in entire variance with the doctrines of the Church of the Seven Hills; he 
told the world so, as other men had done, with feebler voices, before, and 
the best part of the world believed       not him       but the Scripture, 
for he gave it to them in a shape which they could understand.       The 
heretics look not for salvation by the merits either of Luther or Calvin, 
for merits they had none       being merely the instruments which 
Providence selected to commence a great work which He has hitherto not 
thought proper to perfect.       The heretics look for salvation to Christ 
and hope to be forgiven by lively faith in Him and by virtue of His 
blood-shedding.       They trust not in Peter nor in Paul       both men 
and sinners       in Luther nor in Calvin       greater sinners 
still       but in Christ alone.       They trust not in stick nor stone, 
in picture nor in image, in splinter of cross nor bone of saint, but in 
Christ alone       not in His mother or His brother       He Himself has 
said:        those that do the will of my Father that is in heaven, they 
are my mother, they are my brethren.       
Qu        est mater mea, et qui sunt fratres mei? . . .
Quicumque fecerit voluntatem Patris mei, qui in coelis est, ipse meus 
frater et soror et mater est.       Matt. cap. xii. vers. 48-50.
Christ alone is the foundation and cope-stone of the true Church.

28th Novr. 1837, Madrid,
No. 16 Calle St. Iago,  span 
class="smcap">piso 3ro.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have just 
received your letter [of Nov. 15th], for which I thank you heartily.       
I write these lines in a great hurry, as no time must be lost.       The 
shop opened yesterday, and several Testaments have been sold, but three 
parts of the customers departed on finding that only the New Testament was 
to be obtained; and I may here state that if the books which I carried to 
the provinces had been Bibles, I could have sold ten times the amount of 
what I did.       I must therefore be furnished with Bibles 
instanter.       Send me therefore the London edition, bad as it is, say 
500 copies.       I believe you have a friend at Cadiz, the consul, who 
would have sufficient influence to secure their admission into Spain.      
But the most advisable way would be to pack them in two chests, placing at 
the top Bibles in English and other languages, for there is a demand, viz.:
100 English, 100 French, 50 German, 50 Hebrew, 50 Greek, 10 Modern Greek, 
10 Persian, 20 Arabic.       Pray do not fail.
Direct the books thus:

I start to-morrow for Toledo with 100 Testaments, for I must spare no 
exertion in such a cause.       I go as usual on horseback.       I am in a
great hurry and can write no more.
Yours most truly,
(Send, with the books, a Modern Greek grammar and dictionary.       You 
must likewise renew my credit on Messrs. O       Shea       Compy.)
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Jany. 8, 1838)
Madrid, Calle 
Santiago No. 16,
Dec. 25, 1837.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have to 
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, and also my 
friend Mr. Jackson       s of the 8th.       I should have replied ere 
this, had not my time been entirely occupied since my return from 
Toledo.       The versions of St. Luke in Gitano and Basque have been 
committed to the press; and as the compositors are entirely ignorant of 
these languages a most strict surveillance is required, which I hope will 
be admitted as an excuse for having so long delayed to answer.       I 
expect that within a fortnight my task will be completed.
You are aware that I have established in Madrid a shop, or 
despacho, as it is here called, for the sale of Testaments, and you 
are doubtless anxious to receive information as to its success.       It 
succeeds well, nay, I may say very well, when all circumstances are taken 
into consideration; for it ought to be known that I have ventured upon this
step in the very place which of all in Spain, affords the least chance of a
successful issue, yet at the same time in the place where such a step was 
most needed, provided it be the imperative duty of Christians to make the 
Word of their Master known in the dark portions of the earth.       It was 
a step fraught with difficulties of every kind.       Madrid, it is true, 
is the capital of Spain; yet let no one for a moment suppose that being so 
it is consequently the largest, richest and most enlightened town in the 
Peninsula.       In the first place, it is inferior in population to 
Valencia and Barcelona; in the second, misery and distress reign here to an
extent unknown elsewhere; and so far from its being peculiarly enlightened,
I believe that of all places in the Peninsula it is the least so.       It 
is the centre of old, gloomy, bigoted Spain, and if there be one inveterate
disgusting prejudice more prevalent and more cherished in one spot than 
another, it is here, in this heart of old, popish, anti-christian Spain, 
always difficult of access, but now peculiarly so, as it is scarcely 
possible to travel a league from its gates without being stript naked and 
murdered.       Yet in this singular capital, in the midst of furious 
priests and Carlists, I have ventured upon establishing a shop which bears 
on its front in large letters:        Despatch of the British and Foreign 
Bible Society.              To call the attention of the people to this 
establishment, I printed three thousand advertisements on paper, yellow, 
blue, and crimson, with which I almost covered the sides of the streets, 
and besides this inserted notices in all the journals and periodicals, 
employing also a man after the London fashion to parade the streets with a 
placard, to the astonishment of the populace.
The consequence has been that at present every person in Madrid, man, 
woman, and child, is aware of the existence of the establishment.       You
must feel convinced that such exertions would in London or in Paris have 
insured the sale of the whole edition of the New Testament within a few 
days.       But hitherto I have had to contend with ignorance       and 
such ignorance, with bigotry       and such bigotry, and with great and 
terrible distress.       So that since the opening of the establishment, 
which I hope the Lord will deign to bless, I have contrived to sell, and I 
may say that every copy sold has cost me an exertion, and no slight one, 
between 70 and 80 New Testaments  a 
href="#footnote274" class="citation">[274] and 10 Bibles.       You 
will doubtless wonder where I obtained the latter: in the shop of a 
bookseller who dared not sell them himself, but who had brought them 
secretly from Gibraltar.       Of these Bibles there were two of the large 
edition, printed by William Clowes, 1828 (I would give my right hand for a 
thousand of them); these I sold (on the bookseller       s account) for 70 
reals or 17 shillings each, and the others, which were of the very 
common edition, for 7 shillings, which is, however, far too dear.       My 
own Testament I sell for 10 reals, which every person allows to be 
unaccountably cheap, but I deem it best to be moderate, on account of the 
distress of the times.       Permit me here to observe that this Testament 
has been allowed by people who have perused it, and with no friendly 
feeling, to be one of the most correct works that have ever issued from the
press in Spain, and to be an exceedingly favourable specimen of typography 
and paper: and lucky it is for me that it is impossible to say anything 
against the edition.  a href="#footnote275a" 
class="citation">[275a]       You will easily suppose that such an 
establishment in Madrid has caused a great sensation.       The priests and
bigots are teeming with malice and fury, which hitherto they have thought 
proper to exhibit only in words, as they know that all I do here is 
favoured by Mr. Villiers;  a 
href="#footnote275b" class="citation">[275b] but there is no attempt, 
however atrocious, which may not be expected from such people, and were it 
right and seemly for me, the most insignificant of worms, to make 
such a comparison, I would say that, like Paul at Ephesus, I am fighting 
with wild beasts.
I receive daily a great many applications for copies gratis, as it is 
here the generally received opinion that the Bible Society invariably gives
away its publications; and I must confess that this opinion, however it may
have originated, is very prejudicial to the sale of the Testament.
       Wait a while,        say many,        and these books may be had 
for nothing.       Friends of ours who have been in England have had them 
pressed upon them, and cart-loads have been given away in Cadiz and 
other places.              Such a conversation was related to me yesterday,
by my excellent friend and coadjutor Doctor Usoz, who had just heard it in 
a coffee-house.       Of this gentleman I cannot speak in too high terms of
admiration; he is one of the most learned men in Spain, and is become in 
every point a Christian, according to the standard of the New 
Testament.
My projects are these.       As soon as ever my Gospels are ready, I 
mount the saddle once more, entrusting the despacho and shopman to 
the care of Dr. Usoz.       My course will be directed to Andalusia, a rich
and tolerably enlightened province.       Hitherto I have only had to deal 
with poverty, ignorance, and bigotry; but I hope with God       s 
assistance to accomplish much at Seville and Cadiz.       It is true that 
to arrive there I shall have to pass through La Mancha and the Morena 
district, which are entirely in the hands of the swarms of banditti whose 
general is Palillos (he has upwards of 9000 under his command), or through 
Estremadura, occupied at present by the hordes of Jara and Orejita.       
But I fear nothing, and trust that One above will preserve me.       In the
meantime let me beg and pray that you will send Bibles, Bibles, Bibles of 
all sizes and prices, and in all languages to Madrid.       You cannot 
conceive how helpless and forlorn I feel, 400 miles from the sea-coast, on 
being begged to supply what I possess not.       I received an order the 
other day for 20 Hebrew Bibles.       I replied with tears in my eyes, 
       I have nothing but the New Testament in Spanish.       
You wish to know my reasons for censuring the London edition of the 
Spanish Bible.       I will state them in a few words: the utmost confusion
reigns throughout, both as to accentuation and punctuation; words are 
frequently omitted or misspelt, and occasionally a short sentence is left 
out.       All this is very annoying, but I was perhaps wrong in sending 
home        so unmitigated a censure.              It may possibly occur 
that a Spanish edition, unless superintended by very zealous and careful 
people, may turn out yet more incorrect.       Therefore I should not be 
sorry to see any number arrive at Madrid.
In reply to your observation that I am in a mistake in supposing that 
Bibles have been given away to any extent in the south of Spain, permit me 
to observe, and always with the greatest humility, that I never ventured to
form any supposition respecting the matter.       But the Vicar General of 
Valencia gave as a reason for publishing the circular in which he forbids 
the Bible, an advertisement inserted in the Commercial Diary of Valencia, 
to the effect, that a person was commissioned in that city to sell at cheap
prices, and even to give away gratis to those who might not have money at 
their disposal, copies of the Spanish Bible printed in London; and on this 
passage his commentator observes,        Fine generosity!       Charity 
worthy of applause and gratitude!              The friend who brought me 
the newspaper stated at the time that the advertisement was calculated to 
do harm.       It is certainly liable to much misconstruction.
And now, my dear Sir, having detailed my whereabouts, permit me to 
subscribe myself,
Yours most truly,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Jan. 26, 1838)
Madrid, January 15, 1838.
No. 16 Calle Santiago.
Revd. and dear Sir,       The priests have at
length        swooped upon me,        and I have received a peremptory 
order from the Political Governor of Madrid to sell no more New 
Testaments.       I have been apprehensive of something similar for some 
little time, on account of the late change of Ministry, the present head of
the Cabinet, Ofalia, being one of the most furious bigots in Spain.       I
have just paid a visit to Sir George Villiers, who has promised to do all 
in his power to cause the veto to be annulled.       But I must here state 
that he has not at present much influence, he having opposed with all his 
power the accession of Ofalia to the premiership, to which station the 
latter has been exalted for the mere purpose of serving as an instrument of
the priestly party.       I therefore do not place much reliance in Sir 
George Villiers        power of assisting me; but I have still great 
confidence in myself, through the Almighty in whose cause I am engaged.
Matters were going on very well before this check.       The demand, 
even for Testaments, was becoming considerable, so much so that the clergy 
were alarmed, and the consequence has been this step.       But they had 
previously recourse to another well worthy of them; they attempted to act 
upon my fears.       One of the ruffians of Madrid, called Manolos, 
came up to me one night in a dark street, and told me that unless I 
discontinued selling        my Jewish books        I should have a knife 
       nailed in my heart       ; but I told him to go home, say his
prayers, and tell his employers that I pitied them, whereupon he turned 
away with an oath.       A few days after, I received an order to send two 
copies of the Testament to the office of the Political Governor, with 
which, after consulting with Sir George Villiers, I complied, and in less 
than twenty-four hours, namely, on the evening of last Saturday, an 
alguacil arrived at the shop with the notice prohibiting the further
sale of the New Testament, permission to print which I had obtained from 
the Ministry of Isturitz after so much trouble and anxiety.
One circumstance rejoices me.       They have not shut up my little 
despacho, and as soon as ever the Bibles arrive (and I have advice 
from Barcelona of their being on the way) I shall advertise them, for I 
have received no prohibition respecting the sale of any work but the New 
Testament.       Moreover, within a few days the Gospel of Saint Luke in 
Rommany will be ready for delivery, so that I hope to carry on matters in a
small way till better times arrive.       I have been advised to erase from
the shop windows the words        Despatch of the British and Foreign Bible
Society,        but I intend to do no such thing; those words have tended 
very much to call attention, which was my grand object.       Had I 
attempted to conduct things in an underhand manner, I should at the present
moment scarcely have sold 30 copies instead of nearly 300, which in Madrid 
are more than equivalent to 3,000 sold on the littoral.       People who 
know me not, nor are acquainted with my situation, may be disposed to call 
me rash; but I am far from being so, as I never adopt a venturous course 
when any other is open to me.       But I am not a person to be terrified 
by any danger, when I see that braving it is the only way to achieve an 
object.       The booksellers refused to sell my work; I was compelled to 
establish a shop of my own.       Every shop in Madrid has a name.       
What name should I give mine but the true one?       I was not ashamed of 
my cause nor my colours.       I hoisted them, and have fought beneath them
not without success.
The Levitical party in Madrid have, in the meantime, spared no effort to
vilify me.       They have started a publication called        The friend 
of the Christian religion,        in which has appeared a furious attack 
upon me, which I have however treated with the contempt it deserves.       
But not satisfied with this, they have endeavoured to incite the ignorant 
populace against me, by telling them that I am a sorcerer and a companion 
of Gypsies and witches, and I have been called so in the streets.       
That I am an associate of Gypsies and fortune-tellers I do not deny, and 
why should I be ashamed of their company when my Master mingled with 
publicans and thieves?       Many of the poor Gypsy race come frequently to
visit me, receive instruction, and hear parts of the Gospel read to them in
their own language, and when they are hungry and faint I give them to eat 
and drink.       This may be deemed sorcery in Spain, but I am not without 
hope that it will be otherwise estimated in England; and were I to perish 
to-morrow I think there are some who would be disposed to say that I have 
lived not altogether in vain (always as an instrument of the        Most 
Highest       ), having been permitted to turn one of the most valuable 
books of God into the speech of the most oppressed and miserable of His 
creatures.
No more at present, but I hope to write again within a few days.
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Mar. 27, 1838)
Madrid, Calle 
Santiago, No. 16.
17 March, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       As I entertain 
little doubt that yourself and my other good friends are anxious to obtain 
information respecting the course of matters in Madrid, I write the present
letter, although I could have wished to tarry a little longer, in the hope 
of being able to afford more satisfactory intelligence.       In the first 
place, allow me to state that about six weeks since I despatched to England
a copy of Saint Luke in Rommany, by the courier of the Embassy, which I 
hope you received, and that it afforded you satisfaction.       I may also 
add that yesterday the printing of the Basque translation of the same 
Gospel was brought to a happy conclusion, to my very great satisfaction, as
it has caused me much trouble and anxiety, the press having been brought to
a stop three times from the necessity of casting fresh type, the usual 
Spanish founts being insufficient to print a sheet in this singular 
language, owing to all its words being contained within the compass of six 
or seven letters, the demand for which is in consequence tremendous.       
With the Rommany I had no difficulty whatever.       Within a week or two 
it is my intention to publish both Gospels simultaneously.       With this 
preamble, I will now proceed to other matters.
During the last two months I have been almost incessantly engaged in 
negotiations with the Ministry of Count Ofalia, for the purpose of 
obtaining permission to sell the New Testament in Madrid and the 
nullification of the prohibition.       I have experienced, as might be 
expected, great opposition, which I have not yet surmounted; but I am by no
means dispirited, as these obstacles are merely temporary.       I have had
to contend against six Bishops at present resident in Madrid, and amongst 
them him of Toledo, the Primate of Spain, who have denounced the Bible, the
Bible Society, and myself.       Nevertheless, notwithstanding their 
powerful and united efforts, they have been unable to effect their 
principal object, namely, my expulsion from Madrid and Spain.       The 
Count Ofalia is a very good and excellent man, though weak and 
superstitious to an exceeding degree; and notwithstanding he has permitted 
himself to be made the instrument, to a certain extent, of these people, he
will not consent to be pushed to such a length.       Throughout this 
business, as far as it has proceeded, I cannot find words sufficiently 
strong, to do justice to the zeal and interest which Sir George Villiers 
has displayed in the cause of the Testament.       He has had six 
interviews with Ofalia on the subject, and in these he has expressed to him
his sense of the injustice and tyranny which have been practised in this 
instance towards his countryman, as he does me the honour of calling 
me.       Ofalia has been much moved by these remonstrances, and on several
occasions has promised to do all in his power to oblige Sir George; but 
then the Bishops, and particularly his confessor, whom he consults every 
night, again beset him, and playing upon his religious fears, prevent him 
from acting a just, honest, and honourable part.
At the desire of Sir George Villiers, I drew up, a little time since, a 
brief account of the Bible Society and an exposition of its views, 
especially in respect to Spain, which he himself presented with his own 
hand to the Count.       Of this memorial I send you a translation, and I 
think that you will do me the justice to say that, if I have not flattered 
and cajoled, I have expressed myself honestly and frankly, as a Christian 
ought.       Ofalia on reading it, said,        What a pity that this is a 
mixed society, and that all its members are not Catholics.              A 
few days subsequently, to my great astonishment, he sent a message to me by
a friend, requesting that I would send him a copy of my Gypsy Gospel.      
I may as well here state that the fame of this work, although unpublished, 
has spread like wildfire through Madrid, and every person is passionately 
eager to possess a copy; indeed, several grandees of Spain have sent 
messages with similar requests, all of which I have, however, denied.      
I instantly resolved to take advantage of this overture on the part of 
Count Ofalia, and to call on him myself.       I therefore caused a copy of
the Gospel to be handsomely bound, and proceeding to the palace, was 
instantly admitted to him.       He is a dusky, diminutive person, between 
fifty and sixty years of age, with false hair and teeth, but exceedingly 
gentlemanly manners.       He received me with great affability, and 
thanked me for my present; but on my proceeding to speak of the New 
Testament, he told me that the subject was surrounded with difficulties, 
and that the whole body of the clergy had taken up the matter against me; 
but he conjured me to be patient and peaceable, and he would endeavour to 
devise some plan to satisfy me.       Amongst other things, he said that 
the Bishops hated a sectarian more than an atheist; whereupon I replied, 
that, like the Pharisees of old, they cared more for the gold of the Temple
than the Temple itself.       Throughout the whole of our interview he 
evidently laboured under great fear, and was continually looking behind and
around him, seemingly in dread of being overheard, which brought to my mind
an expression of Sir George Villiers, that if there be any truth in 
metempsychosis, the anima of Count Ofalia must have originally 
belonged to a mouse.       We parted in kindness, and I went away wondering
by what strange chance this poor man had become Prime Minister of a country
like Spain.
I have now given a plain narrative of what I have been about up to the 
present moment, by which you will see that I have accomplished all that lay
within the circumscribed sphere of my ability, and have brought every 
engine into play which it was in my power to command.       Let it always 
be borne in mind that it was no fault of mine that, immediately after my 
arrival in Madrid from my journey, a retrograde Ministry came into power, 
the head of which is a weak, timid, priest-ridden man.       Sir George has
several times told me, that had the Ministry of Calatrava and Mendizabal 
remained in place, he himself would have answered that I should have 
received no interruption in my labours, and that he will almost say the 
same in respect to any future Ministry; and it is impossible that the 
present can long maintain its ground, as it is disliked by the Court and 
despised by the people.
I therefore write at present for instructions.       Shall I wait a 
little time longer in Madrid; or shall I proceed at once on a journey to 
Andalusia and other places?       I am in strength, health and spirits, 
thanks be to the Lord! and am at all times ready to devote myself, body and
mind, to His cause.       Therefore I pray that my friends at home will 
point out the course which they think I ought to pursue under these 
circumstances.       In a few days I shall send my account to Mr. 
Hitchin.       I have hitherto delayed, not having yet settled for the 
printing of the Basque St. Luke.       I received your kind letter of the 
8th ultimo.
I remain, my dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. B.
P.S.       I have received the 500 Bibles in sheets from 
Barcelona.
Translation of a Memorial to his Excellence the Count 
D       Ofalia
(Endorsed: Memorial of Mr. G. Borrow to
Count Ofalia, Madrid, recd. March 28,1838.)
To His Excellence The Count D       Ofalia
Sir,       I have the honour to inform you 
that, being a member and Agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society, I 
some months since printed, with permission, at Madrid, an edition of the 
New Testament of Jesus Christ in the Castilian language according to the 
authorised version of Father Felipe Scio, Confessor of the late King 
Ferdinand of happy memory.
That to effect the sale of the said work, in which the Society had 
subjected itself to an expense of more than 100,000 reals, I 
subsequently established a Despatch at Madrid, where the work was publicly 
sold at a moderate price until the 12th of January last, when the person 
intrusted with the management of the said Despatch received a notice from 
Don Francisco Gamboa, Civil Governor of Madrid, forbidding the further sale
of the New Testament until fresh information.
As very erroneous ideas are generally entertained in Spain concerning 
the constitution of the Bible Society and the views in which its 
proceedings originate, I will endeavour in a few words to afford some 
correcting information respecting both.       I beg to state that the Bible
Society is composed of Christians attached to many and various sects and 
forms of worship       for example, members of the Roman, Greek, Anglican, 
Calvinistic, and Lutheran Churches, and of all ranks and grades in society,
who, though they may differ from each other in points of religious 
discipline, form and ceremony, agree in the one grand and principal point: 
that there is no salvation from the punishment due to original sin but 
through vivid faith in Christ, manifested and proved by good works, such 
being the amount of the doctrine found in those inspired writings known as 
the New Testament which contain the words of the Saviour whilst resident in
flesh on earth, together with the revelations of the Holy Spirit to His 
disciples after He had ascended to the throne of His heavenly glory.
Having said thus much respecting those who constitute the Bible Society 
and the religious feeling which unites them, I will now devote a few words 
to the explanation of their views, than which nothing can be more simple or
easily defined.       They have no other wish or intention in thus 
associating together than to assist, as humble instruments under Christ, in
causing His doctrine to be propagated and known in all the regions of the 
vast world, the greatest part of which is still involved in heathenism and 
ignorance; and looking upon their earthly goods as of little or no value in
comparison with such a glorious end, they expend them in printing editions 
of their Master       s Word in all languages, and in transporting them to 
the remotest corners of the earth, that their benighted fellow-creatures 
may see the lamp of salvation, and enjoy the same spiritual advantages as 
themselves.       Such is their wish, such their view, totally unallied 
with commerce or politics, hope of gain and lust of power.       The 
mightiest of earthly monarchs, the late Alexander of Russia, was so 
convinced of the single-mindedness and integrity of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, that he promoted their efforts within his own dominions to 
the utmost of his ability, and established at St. Petersburg a Bible 
Society of his own, whose publications have been a source of blessing not 
only to Russia, but to many other lands.
After the above statement it is unnecessary for me to dilate on the 
intentions of the Society with respect to Spain, a country which perhaps 
most of any in the world is in need of the assistance of the Christian 
philanthropist, as it is overspread with the thickest gloom of heathenish 
ignorance, beneath which the fiends and demons of the abyss seem to be 
holding their ghastly revels; a country in which all sense of right and 
wrong is forgotten, and where every man       s hand is turned against his 
fellow to destroy or injure him, where the name of Jesus is scarcely ever 
mentioned but in blasphemy, and His precepts [are] almost utterly 
unknown.       In this unhappy country the few who are enlightened are too 
much occupied in the pursuit of lucre, ambition, or ungodly revenge to 
entertain a desire or thought of bettering the moral state of their 
countrymen.       But it has pleased the Lord to raise up in foreign lands 
individuals differently situated and disposed, whose hearts bleed for their
brethren in Spain.       It is their belief that ignorance of God       s 
Word is the sole cause of these horrors, and to dispel that ignorance they 
have printed the Gospel in Spain, which they dispose of at a price within 
the power of the poorest to command.       Vain men would fain persuade 
themselves and others that the Society entertains other motives, by which 
uncharitableness they prove that they themselves are neither Christians, 
nor acquainted with the spirit of Christianity.       But let the most 
fearful and dubious reassure themselves with the thought, that should the 
Bible Society foster the very worst intentions, it would baffle their 
power, if even assisted by Satanic agency, to render Spain worse than it at
present is.
I beseech you, Sir, to co-operate in a good cause, and not seek to 
retard its progress; for be assured that sooner or later it will 
triumph.
I have the honour to remain,
Sir,
Your Excellence       s obedient servant,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Apr. 9th, 1838)
March 30, 1838.       Madrid,
16 Calle Santiago.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Without waiting for
an answer to my last, which I despatched some ten days since, I shall take 
the liberty of again troubling you with a short letter.       My principal 
motive for so doing is a visit which I have just been favoured with from 
our friend Mr. Rule of Gibraltar, a gentleman who has much interested me, 
and of whose zeal, piety, and discretion I have formed the highest 
opinion.       It seems that the little congregation at Cadiz has been 
broken up and dispersed by order of the Government, and in consequence he 
has travelled to Madrid to make intercession in its behalf.       I am 
happy to say that Sir George Villiers has promised to befriend him to the 
utmost of his ability.       Since his arrival here he has received 
intelligence which has filled him with much uneasiness, and he has 
entreated me to write home in conjunction with himself respecting the 
affair, with which indeed I am in some degree concerned.       I, however, 
beg leave to state, that it is with the utmost reluctance I say a word upon
the subject, being at all times unwilling to interfere in the slightest 
degree in the projects or movements of another party; but I feel that 
entire silence in this case would be wrong and unadvisable.
I come now to the point.       A friend of ours, who by your last favour
I was informed was about to leave Spain for the benefit of his health, has,
it appears, changed his mind, and is on his way to visit Andalusia and the 
principal towns, namely Cadiz, Malaga, and Seville.       Now Mr. Rule is 
far better acquainted with him than I can pretend to be, and he has told me
that knowing him perfectly well, he entertains great dread as to the effect
which our friend       s visit to those parts will have over the issue of 
the affair which has brought him, Mr. R., to Madrid.       I must here 
observe that I had myself made preparations to visit Andalusia, having 
indeed been advised to do so by Sir George Villiers, who will afford me all
the recommendations and assistance which I can possibly desire.       I may
add that some time since I despatched thither a considerable number of 
Testaments, which are now being sold at Seville, etc.       I therefore 
humbly conceive that the arrival of another edition is likely to produce a 
clash highly detrimental to the interests of the Society, and to perplex 
the minds of the people of the west of Spain respecting its views.       
But I confess I am chiefly apprehensive of the reacting at Seville of the 
Valencian drama, which I have such unfortunate cause to rue, as I am the 
victim on whom an aggravated party have wreaked their vengeance, and for 
the very cogent reason that I was within their reach.       I think, my 
dearest sir, you know sufficient of my disposition to be aware that I am 
one of the last people disposed to make complaint, whether with or without 
cause; but that passage in your affectionate and kind letter which implied,
though in the gentlest terms, that I had been rash in my proceedings in 
Madrid, gave me a pang, more especially as I knew from undoubted sources 
that nothing which I had done, said, or written was the original 
cause of the arbitrary step which had been adopted in respect to me.
There is another matter which gives me much uneasiness and which I wish 
to confide to your bosom and yours alone, though you will, of course, 
communicate it to such friends as you may deem proper.       I have 
received two letters from an ex-priest at Valencia of the name of Marin, to
the first of which I have replied, though very cautiously.       This very 
unfortunate individual, who it seems for some time past has felt the 
workings of the Spirit, was last year induced by certain promises, and 
hopes thrown out, to leave Valencia, where he enjoyed a benefice on which 
he supported himself and an aged mother, and to repair to Gibraltar for the
purpose of receiving Christian instruction under Mr. Rule.       After 
remaining some time at that place, where, Mr. R. informs me, his conduct 
was in most points exemplary, he returned to Valencia, where his apostasy, 
as the Papists termed it, having become known, his salary of six 
pesetas daily was sequestrated, and himself and his parent in 
consequence deprived of their only means of subsistence.       But this is 
not all.       The aid and assistance which he had been led to expect from 
England were withheld in his great pinch and need, and the very persons who
had taken advantage of the commotion within him to induce him to take what 
I must term a rash and hazardous expedition, were the first to forsake him,
and Mr. Rule states that there is cogent reason for fearing that this 
unfortunate man and his aged parent are at present perishing with hunger in
the barbarous streets of Valencia.       I wish it to be known that the man
himself in his letters told me nothing of the promises which had been held 
out to him, nor breathed a word of complaint, I being indebted to Mr. R. 
for my knowledge on this point, who has a very high opinion of his 
sincerity, although he has been termed an impostor, though the fact of his 
having lost his salary by the opinions which he has embraced ought to have 
precluded such an idea.       Now the Lord forbid that this man and his 
mother perish, so that his death be laid by the enemy at the threshold of 
the humble but unworthy servants of Christ.       I therefore this day have
sent him a small sum on my own account to relieve the pinch of utter need, 
till more can be known of him.
Pray excuse this letter written with a heart full of trouble and 
doubt.       Dispose of me as you think proper, my dear sir, who am truly 
yours,
G. B.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. May 1, 1838)
Madrid, April 19, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I enclose a letter 
from Mr. Rule, dated Valencia, 12th inst., which I have just received, and 
upon which I beg to make a few observations.
In this very extraordinary espistle I am requested to take charge of an 
ex-priest of the name of Pascual Marin, on his arrival at Madrid, where it 
appears he is hastening, to furnish him with cash, make an estimate of his 
probable expenses, and moreover to write home to the Society, without 
delay, for the purpose of advising the Committee to join with the gentlemen
of another religious institution in affording the said Marin the means for 
supporting himself in the Spanish capital, where it is the writer       s 
opinion that he may be usefully employed in distributing the 
Scriptures, and in preparing the way for a future mission.       Well and 
good!       But my friends at home, discreet as I know them to be, will 
doubtless be anxious to be informed by virtue of what correspondence or 
communication with me does Mr. Rule now write from Valencia, consigning to 
my hands this person, whom I have never seen, and whom I know not, 
although, as I have stated on a former occasion, I have received two 
letters from him, to one of which I returned a cautious and guarded 
answer.
Mr. Rule suddenly arrived at Madrid, upon some business connected with 
the Society to which he belongs; he called upon me, and I, upon learning 
from him that he was a perfect stranger in Madrid, without friends or 
acquaintances, received him with the hospitality which the Scripture 
enjoins, and which I continued during his stay in the capital, a period of 
about ten days.       In the course of our conversations he spoke to me of 
the peculiar hardships of the case of Pascual Marin of Valencia, who, as he
informed me, had been induced, partly by conviction, and partly by 
persuasion, to secede from his own Church, but who not having received from
England the assistance which he had been led to expect, was in danger of 
perishing, with his mother, in the streets of Valencia, he having lost the 
benefice which constituted their support.       Whereupon through the 
medium of Mr. Rule I sent him 500 reals on my own account, without, 
however, directly or indirectly pledging myself to do anything more in his 
behalf, or to attempt to engage the Bible Society to do so.
Mr. Rule left Madrid for Valencia, and on his departure informed me that
it was his firm intention to carry Marin with him to Gibraltar, to which 
resolution I, of course, made no objection, as I conceived that it was a 
matter with which I had little or no connection, and in which it would be 
advisable not to involve myself, more especially on account of the peculiar
state of the affairs at Madrid with which the Society had done me the 
honour to entrust me.
I was aware that in my situation peculiar caution in every step was 
necessary and indispensable, and after Mr. Rule       s departure I 
harboured not the slightest surmise that my attentions to himself, or the 
slight conversation which I had held with him respecting Marin, could 
possibly tend to compromise me in any point.       I was, however, 
mistaken.
In the name of all that is singular, what does Mr. Rule mean, without 
the courtesy of asking my permission, by sending this man to me at 
Madrid?       Assist in preparing the way for a mission!       Very 
probably; but that mission will be my own, over the frontiers, under an 
escort of lancers.       Assist in distributing the Scriptures!       
Probably again; but it will be to the wild winds of Madrid, when they are 
torn to pieces by the common hangman in the Plaza Mayor, and cast into the 
air.       I must confess that I am vexed and grieved that as fast as I 
build up, some intemperate friend rushes forward, and by his perhaps 
well-meant zeal casts down and destroys what has cost me much labour.
Things are beginning to assume a more favourable aspect.       I have 
opened my shop once more, though not at present for the sale of 
Testaments.       The priests are frantic, and through the medium of one or
other of the Ministers, are continually giving me trouble; but Sir George 
Villiers has vowed to protect me, and has stated so publicly, and he is 
every day acquiring more and more influence here.       He has gone so far 
as to state to Ofalia and Gamboa, that provided I be allowed to pursue my 
plans without interruption, he will be my bail (fiador) and 
answerable for everything I do, as he does me the honour to say that he 
knows me, and that he can confide in my discretion.       Therefore 
let me call upon my beloved and respected friends at home, as they love 
their Lord and the credit of His cause, to offer no encouragement to any 
disposed        to run the muck        (it is Sir George       s 
expression) against the religious or political institutions of 
Spain, to keep clear of the exaltado or republican party, and to 
eschew tracts, with political frontispieces, concerning any 
uncertain future dispensation; but to confine themselves strictly 
and severely to the great work of propagating the Word which sooner or 
later is doomed to christianise the entire world.
I hope I shall be excused the freedom of these observations, when it is 
reflected that I, being the Agent of the Bible Society, have to answer to 
those who protect me here for all that is done in any part of Spain under 
the sanction of the Society.
Concerning Marin and what is to be done in his respect, I feel myself 
after much reflection and private prayer totally incompetent to offer a 
suggestion.       He can be of no possible service to me in Madrid, but the
contrary.       One thing, however, is evident, that, thanks to particular 
individuals, we are to a certain extent compromised.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. B.
To the Rev. Andrew Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. May 3rd, 1838)
Madrid, April 23, 1838,
Calle Santiago.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have to 
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th inst. and also my friend
Mr. Jackson       s of the 5th, containing the resolution of the Committee 
in my respect, which I shall of course attend to.
My reason for troubling you with these lines is an apprehension that my 
late communication has not been understood by you; for there is something 
in the tone of your reply which has made me rather unhappy, though I can 
easily conjecture that at the time you wrote it you were labouring under a 
considerable pressure of business.       Had you paid a little more 
attention to my letter, you would have perceived that it was written 
unwillingly on my part, but Mr. Rule thought his province had been 
invaded.       As for myself I wish to say nothing, but it will be as well 
to remind you that all the difficulty and danger connected with what has 
been accomplished in Spain have fallen to my share, I having been labouring
on the flinty rock and sierra, and not in smiling meadows refreshed by sea 
breezes.       I hoped in Seville and other towns of Andalusia to have 
secured the sale of more Testaments than it is probable that I shall be 
able to do in Spain proper, where I was afraid that my efforts had not been
appreciated; but if my good friend Mr. Graydon has preceded me to those 
regions let him remain there and let no one interrupt him.       I hope in 
the Lord that he will be permitted to prosper.       When you write to him,
present my cordial regards, and assure him that at all times I shall be 
happy to hear from him.
I hope nothing in my last letter, in which I forwarded Mr. R       s 
communication, will be taken in bad part.       I repeat that I was grieved
to have Marin saddled upon me, in a place where I am surrounded by spies 
and persecuted by many and vindictive enemies.       The idea, however, of 
his having gone back to Rome is preposterous, the Bishop of Jaen having 
assured Mr. R. that he had turned a deaf ear to all the promises which had 
been made to him, with the view of inducing him to recant.       He has not
yet made his appearance.
I remain, my dear Sir, yours,
George Borrow.
P.S.       You have never had the urbanity to acknowledge the 
receipt of my Gypsy Gospel.       In the Spanish newspapers it has been 
called a great accession to the literature of Spain.
To Mr. William Hitchin
(Endorsed: recd. May 8, 1838)
Madrid, April 26, 1838.
I take the liberty of herewith sending you my accompt.       It is still
an imperfect one, the printing of the Basque Gospel not being charged for, 
which I have not defrayed, together with some other items, for which I am 
indebted to my printer, who, having lately fought a duel, is laid up with 
his wounds, and cannot for the present transact business.       I have 
charged here, as you will observe, for the translation of the Basque St. 
Luke, an item, which I sent in, in a former accompt, but which appears to 
have been overlooked in your favour of Decr. 28, 1837.       Independent of
the Despatch, I have charged for the hire of a room as a general 
dep       t for the Scriptures.       I am afraid to place my whole stock 
in the shop, owing to the continual persecution to which I am subjected, 
notwithstanding I enjoy powerful protection.       Only last week a band of
alguazils rushed into the premises and seized 25 copies of the 
Gospel of St. Luke in Rommany which I had advertised.       To the present 
accompt of the money which I have disbursed, you will please to add the 
previous one of Novr. 1837, which I sent in, which will enable you to see 
how I stand.
I hope the Financial Committee and yourself will excuse any 
inaccuracies, supposing I have fallen into any, respecting money drawn, as 
I am much busied in negociations, and have lately been so harassed by 
vexatious proceedings, that I believe my mind has somewhat suffered.       
However, glory to God, the Society       s shop is open at Madrid, 
though we are not allowed to advertise and though it be but a small taper 
burning amongst Egyptian darkness.       I hope it will serve as a 
watch-light and beacon to some.
I remain, etc.,
George Borrow.
P.S.       The reprint of 1.5 sheet was owing to want of care on 
my part, in the translation.       I therefore wish that the amount be 
struck out from my disbursements.

Prison of Madrid, May [11], 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I write, as you 
see, from the prison of Madrid, in which I have been confined for the last 
ten days; for it has pleased God to confer upon me the highest of mortal 
honours, the privilege of bearing chains for His sake.       I shall not at
present detail the circumstances which occasioned my arrest, as doubtless 
the English newspapers will afford you all the particulars, nor shall I 
dwell upon the situation in which I find myself, but be content with 
observing that the violence, the preconcerted violence and atrocity, which 
have been practised towards me, will prove the means of accomplishing not 
what my enemies hoped and wished, the destruction and disgrace of the 
Bible-cause in Spain, but its triumph, its pure and sublime triumph.
Satan has, as usual, foiled himself, and his poisoned shafts have 
recoiled, and pierced his own bosom.       You will have heard how 
gallantly Sir George Villiers has taken my part, and how he has made a 
national question of the persecution of which I have been the object, and 
which lately reached its climax.       It will be necessary to tell you 
here that I have always communicated to him the steps which I intended to 
take in order to promote the circulation of the Bible, and they have 
uniformly met with his approbation; therefore you will easily conceive that
in what I have done there has been no rashness nor anything which savoured 
of the arts of the charlatan: I have too much respect for the Gospel and my
own character to have recourse to them.
I will now state a fact which speaks volumes as to the state of affairs 
at Madrid.       My arch-enemy the Archbishop of Toledo, the Primate of 
Spain, wishes to give me the kiss of brotherly peace.       He has caused a
message to be conveyed to me in my dungeon, assuring me that he has had no 
share in causing my imprisonment, which he says was the work of the Civil 
Governor, who was incited to that step by the Jesuits.       He adds that 
he is determined to seek out my persecutors amongst the clergy and to have 
them punished, and that when I leave prison he shall be happy to co-operate
with me in the dissemination of the Gospel!!!
I cannot write much now, for I am not well, having been bled and 
blistered.       I must, however, devote a few lines to another subject, 
but not one of rejoicing or Christian exultation.       Marin arrived just 
after my arrest, and visited me in prison, and there favoured me with a 
scene of despair, abject despair, which nearly turned my brain.       I 
despised the creature, God forgive me, but I pitied him; for he was without
money and expected every moment to be seized like myself and incarcerated, 
and he is by no means anxious to be invested with the honours of 
martyrdom.       I have offered him some relief       what else could I 
do?       He seems partly insane.       I reap, as I expected, the full 
credit of his conversion.       The Bishop of Cordova got up the other day 
in council, and said that I was a dangerous pestilent person, who under the
pretence of selling the Scriptures went about making converts, and moreover
employed subordinates, for the purpose of deluding weak and silly people 
into separation from the Mother Church.
Of this man I have said in a letter to Mr. Rule, not yet sent:        I 
hope that Marin       s history will prove a warning to many of our 
friends, and tend to a certain extent to sober down the desire for doing 
what is called at home smart things, many of which terminate in a 
manner very different from the original expectations of the parties 
concerned.       To do a great and a good thing requires a heart replete 
with the love of Christ and a head cooled by experience and knowledge of 
the world; both of which desiderata I consider incompatible with a wish to 
shine.       
It is probable that I shall leave prison to-morrow.       Pray write to 
my mother and beg her not to be alarmed.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. May 23, 1838)
Madrid, May 13 [1838].
Revd. and dear Sir,       Post is just about 
to start, but I am compelled to write a few words.       The Bible cause 
has triumphed in Spain.       Whatever I do in future connected with the 
Gospel is to have the sanction of the Government, who have expressed a 
desire to co-operate with the Bible Society towards the civilization of the
country.
I left prison yesterday, and this morning was sent for to the British 
Embassy, where Sir George entered into an infinity of details which I 
cannot state at present.       Sir George has commanded me, however, to 
write to the following effect:       
Mr. Graydon must leave Spain, or the Bible Society must publicly disavow
that his proceedings receive their encouragement, unless they wish to see 
the Sacred Book, which it is their object to distribute, brought into 
universal odium and contempt.       He has lately been to Malaga, and has 
there played precisely the same part which he acted last year at Valencia, 
with the addition that in printed writings he has insulted the Spanish 
Government in the most inexcusable manner.       A formal complaint of his 
conduct has been sent up from Malaga, and a copy of one of his 
writings.       Sir George blushed when he saw it, and informed Count 
Ofalia that any steps which might be taken towards punishing the author 
would receive no impediment from him.
I shall not make any observation on this matter further than stating 
that I have never had any other opinion of Mr. Graydon than that he is 
insane       insane as the person who for the sake of warming his own hands
would set a street on fire.       Sir George said to-day that he, Graydon, 
was the cause of my harmless shop being closed at Madrid and also of my 
imprisonment.       The Society will of course communicate with Sir George 
on the subject: I wash my hands of it.
I remain, dear Sir, most truly yours,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. May 28, 1838)
Madrid, May 17, 1838.
Excuse the haste in which my last letter was written; it doubtless 
seemed somewhat incoherent, I will now endeavour to be more explicit.      
Moreover, since sending it, I have had an interview of nearly two hours 
with Count Ofalia, and have much that is new to communicate.       But 
previously to stating what is likely to afford pleasure and satisfaction, I
must proceed to disburden myself of what I heard with the greatest pain, 
and which I communicate with sorrow and reluctance.
Sir George Villiers and Mr. Southern, first Secretary of Legation, were 
the persons who first informed me of what has taken place at Malaga.       
It appears that Mr. Graydon arrived there a short time before my 
imprisonment at Madrid; and instead of endeavouring to circulate the 
Scriptures in a quiet and reasonable manner, such as becomes a gentleman 
and a Christian, and such as had been recommended to me previous to my late
long journey in the north of Spain and which I have always endeavoured to 
follow, he had recourse to means the most improper and disreputable, very 
similar to those which he is said to have followed in all the other towns 
which he has visited.       In order to excite curiosity and cause a 
sensation, he published advertisements and handbills replete with the 
lowest abuse of the Spanish clergy and Government, and containing his own 
private opinions concerning religion.       However, not contented with 
this, he had the cruelty       I will not call it baseness       to speak 
of myself, with, whom he asserted that he was co-operating in every 
point, and that all he was doing was under the sanction of the Bible 
Society.
Intelligence of these proceedings was of course sent to Madrid, with one
of the handbills, which I have not seen, but of which Mr. Southern, a 
literary and accomplished gentleman, has said that its abusive virulence is
only to be equalled by its stupidity and folly.       Sir George Villiers, 
though very unwell, was deeply engaged in my affair, and exchanging 
official notes with the Government.       He had just informed Count Ofalia
that unless full and summary satisfaction were afforded me, he should 
demand his passports, and write to the commanders of all the English ships 
of war engaged in furnishing assistance to Spain, commanding them to 
suspend operations forthwith.       Suddenly Count Ofalia arrived at the 
Embassy, and flinging down on the table one of Graydon       s handbills, 
exclaimed:        Peruse that, and then tell me, as a Cavalier and a 
gentleman, and the Envoy of a powerful and enlightened nation, whether you 
can any longer uphold the cause of your friend in prison, and persist in 
saying that he has been cruelly and unjustly treated.       You see that he
is in the closest connexion with an individual whose conduct every 
civilised man must reprobate, it being a most flagrant breach of common 
decency and order.       
This unexpected incident occurring at such a critical moment almost 
stunned Sir George; but, recovering himself, he denied in the most positive
manner that I had any connexion with Graydon, and asserted that he did not 
believe the latter was an Agent of the Bible Society, and that at all 
events he was quite sure that he had acted in this case without its 
knowledge and concurrence, and that it would be willing to declare so in 
the clearest and most satisfactory manner.
Count Ofalia, finding Sir George so positive, said that since I had such
a voucher he could not reasonably doubt my innocence; and that with respect
to the Society he supposed that it too well understood its own interest to 
trust its affairs to a person whose conduct was calculated to bring odium 
and misfortune on the fairest and most promising cause.       But Sir 
George has subsequently assured me that, but for this unfortunate 
occurrence, he could have made much better terms for me with the Spanish 
Government than from that period he thought it politic to demand.
I will now state one circumstance, and the Lord knows how true it 
is.       It was my prayer night and morning in my dungeon that I might 
hear of no fresh outbreak of this man, whose character I was but too well 
acquainted with, as I think you will concede when you call to mind my 
letter written immediately after I had received intelligence that he was on
the way to Andalusia.       He has up to the present moment been the 
       Evil Genius        of the Bible cause in Spain and of myself, and 
has so chosen his means and moments of operation that he has been almost 
invariably successful in shaking to the ground every feasible plan which my
friends and myself have devised for the propagation of the Gospel in a 
steady and permanent manner.       But I wish not to dwell upon this
subject, and shall only observe that his insane career (for in charity I 
believe him to be insane) must be instantly brought to a termination.      
Sir George has already written him a letter, in which I believe he advises 
him to quit the country.       Mr. Southern the other day made the 
following observation, which I shall ever remember:       
       Sir George Villiers up to the present moment has been disposed to
render you (meaning myself) every assistance, and especially the Bible 
Society, which he looks upon as the most philanthropic institution which 
the world has ever known.       Take care, however, that he be not wearied 
and disgusted.       He must not be involved in such affairs as this of 
Malaga, and it must not be expected that he is to put his lance in rest in 
defence of every person who visits Spain to insult the authorities, and 
who, after having received merited reproof and correction, writes home to 
his friends that he is a martyr in the holy cause of religion.       
I may perhaps give offence by what, I have written.       I shall be 
grieved if it prove so.       But I have had no other resource, and I have 
stated the truth and what my conscience commanded me; and permit me here to
observe, that if any one in the world has a right to be thus free it is 
myself, who have ventured and suffered much in Spain.
Excuse me now for speaking one moment of myself.       Notwithstanding I
have travelled very extensively in this strange country, and have 
established many dep       ts of Testaments most of which are flourishing 
(I have just received intelligence from my correspondent at Valladolid that
forty copies have been sold at Burgos, the heart of Old Castile), not one 
word of complaint has been transmitted to the Government; and though I have
suffered so much persecution in Madrid, I have been but paying (one of my 
sources of information is Count Ofalia himself) the account of others who 
seem to have been reckless as to how much woe and misery they might heap on
my head, provided they could play the part with impunity which their own 
distempered desires dictated.
Now to pleasanter subjects.       Count Ofalia has given me very 
excellent advice, which it will be well if the Society permit me to 
follow.       Amongst other things he said:              Be very cautious 
for some time, and even suspend the sale of the Gospel in Madrid, and 
devote all your energies to make friends amongst the clergy, very many of 
whom are disposed to favour your enterprise.       It would not be prudent 
at present for the Government to interfere with ecclesiastical matters, as 
the war is not yet terminated, but much can be done in a quiet way by 
yourself.       
I must here state that there is a board of ecclesiastics at present 
sitting, occupied in examining the Spanish Bible as printed by the 
Society.       It has been denounced by the Jesuits as not being a faithful
edition of Father Scio       s version, independent of the omission of the 
Apocrypha; but hitherto the opinion of the board has been decidedly in our 
favour, and the Bishop of Vich has, moreover, declared that it probably 
will be expedient to co-operate with the Society in printing cheap editions
of the Scripture for the use of the people, as daily experience shows that 
the old system cannot be carried on and that the sacred writings must be 
thrown open.
The chief difficulty to settle will be the Apocrypha; but I have 
authorised a friend to state that the Society is disposed to make every 
possible concession, and to go so far as to relinquish the Old Testament 
entirely and to content itself with circulating the New.       Perhaps I 
went too far in this advance; but I believe a similar concession has been 
made in the case of Ireland, and I feared to lose all by aiming at too 
much.       However flattering affairs may appear at present, I am well 
aware that a herculean labour is to be surmounted before matters can be 
placed on a safe footing in Spain.       Prudence, coolness and firmness 
are at this moment particularly necessary; and let it never for a moment be
supposed that religious instruction and the knowledge of genuine 
Christianity can be introduced into Spain by scurrilous handbills and the 
low arts of the mountebank.
A split with Rome will very shortly ensue, by which I mean that no 
attention will be paid to Bulls, against which several of the principal 
ecclesiastics have spoken; with these puissant auxiliaries we must act in 
concert.
Allow me in conclusion to state a beautiful piece of conduct of Sir 
George Villiers.       I have commissioned one of the Bishops to request 
for me an interview with the Archbishop of Toledo.       Sir George on 
hearing this said:              Tell the Archbishop that I also am anxious 
for the favour of an interview, in order that I may assist in clearing up 
any doubt, which he may still entertain, respecting the intentions of the 
Bible Society; he has only to state the day, and I will wait upon 
him.       
G. Borrow.

P.S.       I yesterday transmitted you a Spanish newspaper in 
which I have published an advertisement, disclaiming in the name of the 
Bible Society any writings which may have been circulated tending to lower 
the authorities, civil and ecclesiastic, in the eyes of the people, and 
denying that it is its intention or wish to make proselytes from the 
Catholic form of worship.       I took this step by advice, I had likewise 
a particular reason of my own.
Marin is still here looking out for some secular employ, but he is 
continually haunting me.       He tells me that he is preparing an accounts
of all his dealings with G [Graydon] and R [Rule], in which he details the 
promises made him to induce him to sign a document purporting to be a 
separation from the Roman Church.       He says that he was abandoned 
because he refused to preach publicly against the Chapter of Valencia, 
which step would have insured him a dungeon.       This may be true or 
false, but I have taken my precautions.
Translation of the Advertisement
(Endorsed: recd. May 28, 1838)
A rumour having been spread that some individuals, calling themselves 
agents of the British and Foreign Bible Society, under the pretext of 
circulating copies of the Holy Scriptures, have traversed several towns on 
the eastern and western coasts of Spain, and have published writings in 
which the respect due to the ecclesiastical and civil authorities of Spain 
has not been observed, but on the contrary an intention has evidently been 
manifested in them to disparage them in the eyes of the population of those
parts, I hasten to make the following public Declaration:
That such individuals       if it be certain that there are 
such       have in this respect acted upon their own responsibility, 
without permission and even in direct opposition to the intentions of the 
Bible Society, inasmuch as on the principles of the New Testament similar 
attempts are to be reprobated and regarded with horror, being in direct 
opposition to the express commands of the Saviour and His Apostles, who in 
their addresses and writings have on various occasions exhorted the 
faithful to shew respect and obedience to their masters and superiors, even
when they were heretics or idolaters.
And as it has been stated that certain persons, under pretext of being 
agents of the British and Foreign Bible Society, have shown zeal in 
persuading, and have actually in some cases persuaded, various individuals 
to sign documents purporting to be declarations of separation from the 
Catholic Faith       I herewith publicly declare that the British and 
Foreign Bible Society has no connection with such persons; and should there
be any such, it is not disposed either to confirm or to approve their 
proceedings, but on the contrary is desirous of stating in the most 
energetic and solemn manner that it disavows and rejects all connexion or 
intercourse with them.
The British and Foreign Bible Society is composed of individuals 
belonging to all sects, in which those are divided who follow the faith of 
Jesus Christ, amongst whom are seen co-operating for one grand and holy 
object, followers of the Apostles, Romans, and members of the Greek and [of
the] English Church, whose design is the propagation of the word of Christ 
in all countries, separating wholly from the forms of discipline of the 
Church, [which are] matters of secondary consideration, which for a long 
time have filled the world with bloodshed and calamity, and have tended to 
keep up in the hearts of Christians unhappy and malignant feuds.       Far 
from being desirous of making proselytes among those professing the 
Catholic worship, the Bible Society is at all times disposed to hold out 
the hand of Christian fraternity to the clergy of Spain and to co-operate 
with those who believe, as the Catholic clergy assuredly do,        that 
all shall be saved, who, believing in Jesus Christ, show it by their good 
works.

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. June 2, 1838)
Madrid, [May 23rd, 1838].
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have just had an 
interview with the Archbishop [of Toledo].       It was satisfactory to a 
degree I had not dared to hope for.
In the name of the Most Highest take steps for preventing that 
miserable creature Graydon from ruining us all.
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. June 4, 1838)
Madrid, May 25, 1838,
Calle Santiago.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Events follow each 
other so quickly in this singular country, and my situation is so peculiar,
and I am afraid so little understood at home, that I am obliged to take up 
the pen more frequently than I am inclined.       Do not think me intrusive
in again troubling you.       I do it in the hope of preventing any alarm 
which an incorrect report of the following circumstance might cause 
you.
Immediately on receiving intelligence of the scenes which had taken 
place at Malaga, the Spanish Government resolved to put an end to all Bible
transactions in Spain, and forthwith gave orders for the seizure of all the
Bibles and Testaments in the country wherever they might be deposited or 
exposed for sale.       They notified the same to Sir George Villiers, 
expressly stating that the resolution was taken in consequence of the, 
       Ocurrido en Malaga.              I have now learnt that 
several of my dep       ts have been seized in various parts of Spain, for 
example, at Salamanca, Seville, and of course at Malaga.       This, 
however, gives me little uneasiness, for, with the blessing of God, I shall
be able to repair all, always provided I am allowed to follow my own plans,
and to avail myself of the advantages which have lately been opened 
especially to cultivate the kind feeling lately manifested towards me by 
the principal Spanish clergy.
But now prompt measures must be taken on the part of the Bible 
Society.       Knowing as I do the character of the unfortunate man who has
lately caused so much havoc, I am apprehensive that he may be guilty of 
some fresh excess.       From Mr. Rule       s letter, which I forwarded to
you, it appears that for some time it has been his intention to quit Spain,
but not quietly, witness this last affair of Malaga.       Now my fear is 
that on his return to Barcelona, on finding that the books and Bibles 
intrusted to his discretion have been seized, he will publish as a parting 
legacy some tirade against the Government and clergy.       If he do, he 
will probably bring himself into trouble and at all events destruction on 
our cause; for the Government is quite despotic, as indeed is necessary at 
the present time, and the whole of Spain is under martial law.       
Therefore for his own sake, if not for the sake of the cause, let him 
instantly retire, abandoning the Bibles to their fate.       They shall not
be lost.
I have had, as you are aware, an interview with the Archbishop of 
Toledo.       I have not time to state particulars, but he said amongst 
other things,        Be prudent, the Government are disposed to arrange 
matters amicably, and I am disposed to co-operate with them.              
At parting he shook me most kindly by the hand, saying that he liked 
me.       Sir George intends to visit him in a few days.       He is an 
old, venerable-looking man, between seventy and eighty.       When I saw 
him, he was dressed with the utmost simplicity, with the exception of a 
most splendid amethyst ring, the lustre of which was truly dazzling.
My poor servant, a Basque from Hernani, is, I am afraid, dying of the 
jail-fever, which he caught in prison whilst attending me.       He has 
communicated this horrible disorder to two other persons.       Poor Marin 
is also very ill, but I believe with a broken heart; I administer to his 
needs as far as prudence will allow me, for I am grieved for him.       I 
have not yet despatched my letter to Mr. Rule, as I wish not to offend him;
but I cannot approve of his forcing Marin to come up to Madrid, contrary to
his wishes.       Zeal is a precious thing, when accompanied with one grain
of common sense.
In conclusion, I beg leave to say that Sir George Villiers has 
authorised me to state that provided the Bible Society entertain any doubts
respecting my zeal in the Christian cause, or the correctness of my conduct
during my sojourn in Spain, he hopes they will do him the satisfaction to 
communicate with him.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. June 23, 1838)
June 13, 1838, Madrid,
No. 16 Calle St. Iago,
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have received 
your letter of June 1st, but not that of the 30th May which you allude to 
in the same, therefore I am still in the dark upon many points.
Another bitter cup has been filled for my swallowing.       The Bible 
Society and myself have been accused of blasphemy, sedition, etc.       A 
collection of tracts has been seized in Murcia, in which the Catholic 
religion and its dogmas are handled with the most abusive severity; these 
books have been sworn to as having been left by the Committee of the 
Bible Society whilst in that town, and Count Ofalia has been called 
upon to sign an order for my arrest and banishment from Spain.       Sir 
George, however, advises me to remain quiet and not to be alarmed; as he 
will answer for my innocence.
I am now compelled to ask a blunt question.       Will the Bible Society
look calmly on and see itself compromised and my life and liberty exposed 
to danger by the lunatic vagaries of that unfortunate Graydon, who, like a 
swine in a field newly sown, has of late been solely occupied in rooting up
the precious seed and destroying every hope of a glorious harvest?       
The newspapers are teeming with articles against us, for we are no longer 
looked upon as a Society founded on the broad principles of Christianity, 
but as one instituted for the carrying into effect of sectarian 
purposes.
In justice to me, it behoves the Society to communicate with Sir George 
Villiers, who has abstracts of all the letters which I have written to the 
Society, and who will vouch for their correctness.
Do not be cast down; all will go well if the stumbling block be 
removed.       I write in haste.
G. Borrow.
P.S.       What do you mean, my dear Sir, by the        grano 
salis       ?
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. June 25, 1838)
Madrid, June 14, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Immediately after 
having despatched my letter of yesterday, I received through my friend, Mr.
Wood, a communication from the Bishop of ---, the president of the body of 
ecclesiastics at present engaged in examining our Bible.
He is of my opinion that the Committee of the Bible Society should in 
the present exigency draw up an exposition of their views respecting Spain,
stating what they are prepared to do, and what they are not prepared to 
do       above all, whether in seeking to circulate the Gospel in this 
country they harbour any projects hostile to the Government and the 
established religion; moreover, whether the late distribution of tracts was
done by their connivance or authority, and whether they are disposed to 
sanction in future the publication in Spain of such a class of 
writings.
It of course does not become me to advise the Committee and yourself 
upon this point.       I merely take the liberty of communicating the 
circumstance, and observing that the Prelate in question is a most learned 
and respectable man, and one of the warmest of our friends.
I have not seen any of the tracts seized at Murcia, nor do I wish.      
If examined by the Council, I shall declare on oath that I am innocent and 
ignorant of the matter, and that I believe the Bible Society to be the 
same.       Sir George assured me that one or two of them were outrages not
only to common sense but decency.
I forgot to tell you yesterday that my poor servant is dead.       He 
died of the pestilential typhus caught in the prison; his body at the 
period of his death was a frightful mass of putridity, and was in 
consequence obliged to be instantly shovelled into the Campo Santo or 
common field of the dead near Madrid.       May Christ be his stay at the 
Great Day; a more affectionate creature never breathed.
Hear now what the Madrid Gazette says of our Society, in an 
article in which it reproves in the strongest terms the conduct lately 
pursued by pseudo-agents, and gives me a rap on the knuckles for an 
anti-catholic expression or two in the advertisement in which I denounced 
them.       The Gazette is the official organ of the Government, and
all it says is under authority:       
       We will not conclude this article without bestowing the merited 
tribute of praise on the project truly magnificent of the Bible Society, 
considered not under the religious but the social aspect.       
Christianity has been, is, and will be the grand agent in the civilisation 
of the world; and the preaching of its doctrine, and the propagation of its
maxims among the nations who know it not, is the most costly present which 
can be offered them, and the pledge of belonging one day to the civilised 
world; or if they already belong to it, of ameliorating their actual 
condition in society.
       Excellent moral results must also be produced among the poorer 
classes of the people in Christian countries by the distribution of copies 
of the sacred writings; and the Bible Society acts with the highest 
prudence, by accommodating itself to the civil and ecclesiastic laws of 
each country, and by adopting the editions there current.       In Spain, 
where every translation of the Bible is forbidden, and in general every 
book of religion, without previous censure and license of the 
ecclesiastical authority, much good may arise from distributing either of 
the two translations, that of Father Scio or that of Amat; but precisely as
they are, and without the suppression of the notes, which explain some 
difficult passages.       If the great object be the propagation of the 
evangelic maxims, the notes are no obstacle, and by preserving them we 
fulfil our religious principle of not permitting to private reason the 
interpretation of the sacred Word.       
Excuse me this long extract.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
G. Borrow.
P.S.       I should wish to make another Biblical tour this 
summer, until the storm be blown over.       Should I undertake such an 
expedition, I should avoid the towns and devote myself entirely to the 
peasantry.       I have sometimes thought of visiting the villages of the 
Alpujarra mountains in Andalusia, where the people live quite secluded from
the world.       What do you think of my project?
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. 27th June, 1838)
Madrid, June 16, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have received 
your communication of the 30th ult., containing the resolutions of the 
Committee, to which I shall of course attend.
Of your letter in general, permit me to state that I reverence the 
spirit in which it is written, and am perfectly disposed to admit the 
correctness of the views which it exhibits.                              
                                           
                                                                       , 
                                                                
                                                         .       But it 
appears to me that in one or two instances I have been misunderstood in the
letters which I have addressed [to you] on the subject of Graydon.
I bear this unfortunate gentleman no ill will, God forbid, and it will 
give me pain if he were reprimanded publicly or privately; moreover I can 
see no utility likely to accrue from such a proceeding.       All that I 
have stated hitherto is the damage which he has done in Spain to the cause 
and myself, by the       what shall I call it?       imprudence of his 
conduct; and the idea which I have endeavoured to inculcate is the absolute
necessity of his leaving Spain instantly.
Take now in good part what I am about to say, and O! do not 
misunderstand me!       I owe a great deal to the Bible Society, and the 
Bible Society owes nothing to me.       I am well aware and am always 
disposed to admit that it can find thousands more zealous, more active, and
in every respect more adapted to transact its affairs and watch over its 
interests.       Yet with this consciousness of my own inutility I must be 
permitted to state that linked to a man like Graydon I can no longer 
consent to be, and that if the Society expect such a thing, I must take the
liberty of retiring, perhaps to the wilds of Tartary or the Zigani camps of
Siberia.
My name at present is become public property       no very enviable 
distinction in these unhappy times, and neither wished nor sought by 
myself.       I have of late been subjected to circumstances which have 
rendered me obnoxious to the hatred of those who never forgive, the bloody 
Church of Rome, which I have doubt will sooner or later find means to 
accomplish my ruin; for no one is better aware than myself of its fearful 
resources, whether in England or Spain, in Italy or in any other 
part.       I should not be now in this situation, had I been permitted to 
act alone.       How much more would have been accomplished, it does not 
become me to guess.
I had as many or more difficulties to surmount in Russia than I 
originally had here, yet all that the Society expected or desired was 
effected without stir or noise, and that in the teeth of an imperial 
Ukase which forbade the work which I was employed to 
superintend.
Concerning my late affair, I must here state that I was sent to prison 
on a charge which was subsequently acknowledged not only to be false but 
ridiculous.       I was accused of uttering words disrespectful towards the
Gefe Politico of Madrid; my accuser was an officer of the police who
entered my apartment one morning before I was dressed, and commenced 
searching my papers and flinging my books into disorder.       Happily, 
however, the people of the house who were listening at the door heard all 
that passed, and declared on oath that, so far from mentioning the Gefe 
Politico, I merely told the officer that he, the officer, was an 
insolent fellow and that I would cause him to be punished.       He 
subsequently confessed that he was an instrument of the Vicar General and 
that he merely came to my apartment in order to obtain a pretence for 
making a complaint.       He has been dismissed from his situation, and the
Queen has expressed her sorrow at my imprisonment.       If there be any 
doubt entertained on the matter, pray let Sir George Villiers be written 
to!
I should be happy to hear what success attends our efforts in 
China.       I hope a prudent conduct has been adopted; for think not that 
a strange and loud language will find favour in the eyes of the Chinese; 
and above all, I hope that we have not got into war with the Augustines and
their followers, who, if properly managed, may be of incalculable service 
in propagating the Scriptures.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, truly yours,
G. Borrow.
P.S.       The documents, or some of them, shall be sent as soon 
as possible.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. July 5, 1838)
Madrid, June 26, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I shall not be able
to send the documents in question, as they are lodged in the archives, and 
are now become state-papers.       Those that relate to the affair at 
Malaga I have not yet been able to obtain a perusal of; it will therefore 
perhaps suffice for the present to say that in one of them the Government 
was stigmatized as being        voraz de pesetas        (voracious 
of pesetas), and the Catholic religion termed        un sistema del mas 
grosero fanatismo        (a system of the grossest fanaticism).       
It was well for the writer of this trash that the Government were at the 
time alarmed at the step which they had taken in imprisoning myself, and 
did not wish to press the matter home: otherwise he could not have escaped 
so easily as he did.       Yet what must we think of an Englishman, who, 
relying for protection on the fear and respect which the mighty country to 
which he belongs everywhere inspires, visits a Spanish town in a state of 
revolution       as Malaga was       and, for the bringing about a 
particular object, adds to the ferment by appealing to already excited 
passions?       But I shall not dwell further on this subject.       The 
Society are already aware of the results of the visit of our friend to 
Malaga, all their Bibles and Testaments having been seized throughout 
Spain, with the exception of my stock in Madrid (upwards of 
3000)       Count Ofalia having in a communication to Sir George declared 
that he had full confidence in my honour and good faith, being well 
persuaded that I harboured no designs but those I professed.
I send you on the other side some extracts from one of the tracts which 
purports to be        A true history of the Virgin of Sorrows, to whom Don 
Carlos, the Rebel and Fanatic, has dedicated his cause, and the ignorance 
which he trumpets.              The one, however, which has given most 
offence is        A Catechism on the Principal Controversies between 
Protestants and Catholics,        translated from the English.
I now await your orders.       I wish to know whether I am at liberty to
pursue the course which may seem to me best under existing circumstances, 
and which at present appears to be to mount my horses which are neighing in
the stable, and once more to betake myself to the plains and mountains of 
dusty Spain, and to dispose of my Testaments to the muleteers and 
peasants.       By doing so I shall employ myself usefully, and at the same
time avoid giving offence.       Better days will soon arrive, which will 
enable me to return to Madrid and reopen my shop; till then, however, I 
should wish to pursue my labours in comparative obscurity.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
George Borrow.
P.S.       I am engaged in translating the Acts of the Apostles 
into Basque.

ensencialmente id        latra, ha sabido introducir la idolatria bajo las

cuando menos, se atesorase el espiritu de Cristo, que mejor empleara sus 
bulas barriendo la Iglesia Romana de todas sus iniquidades, que no 
promulgando tan injustas prohibiciones.       Pero ya que, afferrandose 
contra mejora, esta iglesia proteje y consagra por todas partes un 
sinnumero de supersticiones y cultos err        neos, claro est         que
con esto se alza y caracteriza como uno de los principales ajentes del 
Anticristo.

On the other side I beg leave to present my account.       One or two 
items require some explanation.
1st, Mr. Borrego       s bill of 3084 reals, of which 1760 are 
for the printing of the Basque Gospel, the remainder is for advertisements,
boxes, package and freight of books to various parts of Spain, namely, to 
Valencia, Malaga, Santander, Corunna, etc.       The original bill I shall 
forward as soon as it has been signed and vouched for by Messrs. 
O       Shea, who paid the money.
2nd, As to prison expenses, I must observe that the Government after 
placing me at liberty offered to indemnify me for all the expense I had 
incurred in prison, but I refused to accept their offer; should, however, 
the Committee think that I ought to have done so, they will deduct the 
amount.
3rd, 60 reals for porterage; on receiving intelligence that my 
depots had been seized in various parts of the country, I thought it 
advisable to place my stock in Madrid in safety, and in consequence under 
cover of night removed it from the shop, and concealed it in portions in 
the houses of various friends.
In conclusion, I must beg that you will collate my present account with 
my last, as I am apprehensive that I may have charged the same outlay 
twice; the copy of my last account was lost when my papers were seized.
I make an excursion to-morrow to the rural districts of New Castile, 
which will probably occupy a fortnight.       I have sent before me two 
hundred Testaments.
I remain, etc.,

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. July 28, 1838)
Villa Seca, District of 
Toledo,
July 14, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I write these lines
from Villa Seca, a village situated on the bank of the Tagus about nine 
leagues from Madrid.       A few minutes before my departure I received 
your letter of the 29th June, in which you mention letters being on the way
for me.       I, however, could not wait for them for many reasons, 
principally because in that event I should have lost a considerable number 
of Testaments, which I had sent before me.       I am moreover tolerably 
well acquainted with the contents [of] those communications from the one 
which I have already received.
For some time past I have been determined at whatever risk to make an 
effort to circulate the Scriptures in the rural districts of New Castile, 
where I am grieved to say the most profound ignorance of true religion 
prevails.       I have been induced to take up my quarters for the present 
in Villa Seca, from being well acquainted with a labourer of the place; 
moreover its situation is favourable to my views as there are many other 
villages in its vicinity.       Poverty it is true abounds, but I am 
perfectly sure that our friends at home are disposed to make every 
reasonable sacrifice, and not for a moment to balance the dust of Mammon 
against the eternal welfare of their fellow-creatures.
For the last two days I have been riding in various directions.       It
is a great blessing that heat agrees with me wonderfully, as we have no 
less than thirty-six degrees according to R        aumur; otherwise it 
would be impossible for me to accomplish anything, the atmosphere 
resembling the flickering glow about the mouth of an oven.       I have 
already disposed of about thirty Testaments, of course at exceedingly low 
prices.       To-day, however, I have commenced a new course, and have sent
abroad various peasants with some parcels of Testaments; my host, whom it 
has pleased the Lord to render favourable to the cause, has himself taken 
the field, and has proceeded to the neighbouring village of Vargas mounted 
on his donkey.       If success do not attend my efforts, the Lord knows 
that it will be no fault of mine.       It will be the working of His own 
holy will.
I had scarcely written the above lines when I heard the voice of the 
donkey in the court-yard, and going out I found my host returned.       He 
had disposed of his whole cargo of twenty Testaments at the old Moorish 
village of Vargas, distant from hence about two leagues, and all in the 
space of about half an hour.       Eight poor harvest-men, who were 
refreshing themselves at the door of the wine-house, purchased each a copy;
whilst the village schoolmaster took all the rest for the little ones 
beneath his care, lamenting at the same time the great difficulty he had 
long experienced in obtaining religious books, owing to their scarcity and 
extravagant price.       Many other persons were also anxious to procure 
Testaments, but my envoy (Juanito Lopez) was unable to supply them.       
At his departure they requested him to return within a few days.
I will not conceal from you that I am playing a daring game, and it is 
very possible that when I least expect it I may be seized, tied to the tail
of a mule, and dragged either to the prison of Toledo or Madrid.       Yet 
such a prospect does not discourage me in the least, but rather urges me on
to persevere; for I assure you       and in this assertion there lurks not 
the slightest desire to magnify myself and produce an effect       that I 
am eager to lay down my life in this cause, and whether a Carlist       s 
bullet or the jail-fever bring my career to an end, I am perfectly 
indifferent.       But I have other matters now to speak of.
You hint that a desire is entertained at home to have a personal 
conference with me.       In the name of the Highest I entreat you all to 
banish such a preposterous idea.       A journey home (provided you intend 
that I should return to Spain) could lead to no result but expense and the 
loss of precious time.       I have nothing to explain to you which you are
not already perfectly well acquainted with by my late letters.       I was 
fully aware at the time I was writing them that I should afford you little 
satisfaction, for the plain unvarnished truth is seldom agreeable.       
But I now repeat, and these are perhaps among the last words which I shall 
ever be permitted to pen, that I cannot approve, and I am sure no Christian
can, of the system which has lately been pursued in the large sea-port 
cities of Spain, and which the Bible Society has been supposed to sanction,
notwithstanding the most unreflecting person could easily foresee that such
a line of conduct could produce nothing in the end but obloquy and 
misfortune.
It was unkind and unjust to taunt me with having been unsuccessful in 
distributing the Scriptures.       Allow me to state that no other person 
under the same circumstances would have distributed the tenth part.       
Yet had I been utterly unsuccessful, it would have been wrong to check me 
with being so, after all I have undergone       and with how little of that
are you acquainted.       You are perfectly correct in concluding that 
certain persons are laughing in their sleeve.       But at what?       At 
the success of their own machinations?       Not at all!       They are 
laughing at the inconceivable fatuity which induces those whom they once
dreaded to destroy themselves and their own labours.       The stone 
with immense toil is rolled up to the brow of the mountain, when they see 
it recoil, not at the touch of Jupiter but at the impulse of the insane 
Sisyphus, who pulls it down on his own body.       With common sense and 
prudence very much might have been accomplished in Spain, and still 
may.       I am sorry to say that hitherto very little of [that] has been 
used.
You are surprised that I should presume to hint that I have been linked 
to G. [Graydon], but at the same time admit that my identification with him
by my enemies has been unavoidable.       Now in the name of all that is 
reasonable, to what does such an admission amount but that I have been 
linked to this man, and it matters very little whether or not I have been 
brought into personal contact with him.       But now farewell to him: and 
in taking leave of this subject, I will add that the unfortunate M. [Marin]
is dying of a galloping consumption, brought on by distress of mind.       
All the medicine in the world would not accomplish his cure.
With God       s permission I will write again in a few days and till 
then,
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, most truly yours,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. July 30, 1838)
Villa Seca, New 
Castille, 17 July 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I addressed a 
letter to you on the 14th instant, which I hope you will receive in course 
of time, together with the present; in that letter I informed you where I 
was, stating my proceedings and intentions.       It has pleased the Lord 
to permit me to be hitherto very successful in these regions, so much so 
that during less than a week I have disposed of the entire stock of 
Testaments which I brought with me, namely two hundred; only three or four 
remain, which are already bespoken.       Last night I sent off a messenger
to Madrid for a fresh supply, which I expect will arrive in a day or 
two.
I must here observe that up to the present moment I have endeavoured as 
much as possible to avoid noise, and notoriety.       Advertisements and 
handbills I have utterly eschewed.       I brought none with me, and in 
these rural places, the name of a printing press is unknown; nor have I 
much endeavoured to work upon the mind of the simple peasantry around me by
words.       I merely tell them that I bring them the words and life of the
Saviour and His saints at a price adapted to their humble means.       
Nevertheless the news of the arrival of the book of life is spreading like 
wild-fire through the villages of the Sagra of Toledo, and wherever my 
people and myself direct our course we find the inhabitants disposed to 
receive our merchandise; it is even called for where not exhibited.       
Last night as I was bathing myself and [my] horse in the Tagus, a knot of 
people gathered on the bank crying:        Come out of the water, 
Englishman, and give us books; we have got our money in our 
hands.              The poor creatures then held out their hands filled 
with cuartos, a copper coin of the value of a farthing, but I had 
unfortunately no Testament to afford them.       My servant, however, who 
was at a short distance, having exhibited one, it was instantly torn from 
his hands by the people, and a scuffle ensued to obtain possession of 
it.       It has very frequently occurred that the poor labourers in the 
neighbourhood, being eager to obtain Testaments and having no money to 
offer us in exchange, have brought various other articles to our cottage as
equivalents       for example, rabbits, fruit and barley; and I have made a
point never to disappoint them, as such articles are of utility either for 
our own consumption or that of the horses.
In Villa Seca there is a school in which fifty-seven children are taught
the first rudiments of education.       Yesterday morning the schoolmaster,
a tall slim figure of about sixty, bearing on his head one of the peaked 
hats of Andalusia and wrapped notwithstanding the excessive heat of the 
weather in a long cloak, made his appearance, and having seated himself 
requested to be shown one of our books.       Having delivered it to him, 
he remained examining it for nearly half an hour without uttering a 
word.       At last he laid it down with a sigh and said that he should be 
very happy to purchase some of these books for his school, but from their 
appearance, especially from the quality of the paper and binding, he was 
apprehensive that to pay for them would exceed the means of the parents of 
his pupils, as they were almost destitute of money, being poor 
labourers.       He then commenced blaming the Government, which, he said, 
established schools without affording the necessary books, adding that in 
his school there were but two books for the use of all his pupils, and 
these he confessed contained but little good.       I asked him what he 
considered the Testaments were worth.       He said,        Se        or
Cavalier, to speak frankly I have in other times paid twelve 
reals for books inferior to yours in every respect, but I assure you
that my poor pupils would be utterly unable to pay the half of that 
price.              I replied,        I will sell you as many as you please
for three reals each; I am acquainted with the poverty of the land, 
and my friends and myself in affording the people the means of spiritual 
instruction have no wish to curtail their scanty bread.              He 
replied:        Benedito seo Dios        (       blessed be 
God       ), and could scarcely believe his ears.       He instantly 
purchased a dozen, expending therein, as he said, all the money he 
possessed with the exception of a few cuartos.       The 
introduction of the reading of the Word of God into the country schools of 
Spain is therefore now begun, and I humbly hope that it will prove one of 
those events which the Bible Society after the lapse of years will have 
most reason to remember with joy and gratitude to the Almighty.
An old peasant is at present reading in the portico.       Eighty-four 
years have passed over his head, and he is almost entirely deaf; 
nevertheless he is reading aloud the second [chapter] of Matthew.       
Three days since he bespoke a Testament, but not being able to raise the 
money he has not redeemed it until the present moment; he has just brought 
thirty farthings.       As I survey the silvery hair which overshadows his 
sun-burnt countenance, the words of the song occur to me:        Lord, now 
lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to Thy word: for mine 
eyes have seen Thy salvation.       
I will now conclude these anecdotes with one not divested of 
singularity.       Over a branch of the Tagus by the bridge Azeca there is 
a large water-mill.       I have formed an acquaintance with the tenant of 
this mill, who is known in the neighbourhood by the name of Don 
Antero.       Two days ago, taking me into a retired place, he asked me to 
my great astonishment if I would sell him a thousand Testaments at the 
price at which I was disposing of them to the peasantry, saying that if I 
would consent he would pay me immediately; in fact he put his hand into his
pocket, and pulled it out filled with gold ounces.       I asked him what 
was the reason for his wish to make so considerable a purchase.       
Whereupon he informed me that he had a relation in Toledo whom he wished to
establish, and that he was of opinion that he could do no better than take 
a shop there and furnish it with Testaments.       I told him that he must 
think of nothing of the kind, as probably the books would be seized on the 
first attempt to introduce them into Toledo, as the priests and canons were
much averse to their distribution.       He was, however, not disconcerted,
and said his relation could travel, as I myself was doing, to dispose of 
them to the peasants with profit to himself.       I confess I was disposed
at first to accept his offer, but at length declined it, as I did not wish 
to expose a poor man to the risk of losing money, goods, and perhaps 
liberty and life.       I was likewise averse to the books being offered to
the peasantry at an advanced price, being aware that they could not afford 
it; and the books, by such an attempt would lose a considerable part of 
that prestijio (I know no English word to express my meaning) which 
they now enjoy.       Their cheapness strikes the minds of the people with 
wonder, and they consider it almost as much in the light of a miracle as 
the Jews [did the] manna which dropped from heaven at the time they were 
famishing, or the spring which suddenly gushed from the flinty rock to 
assuage their thirst in the wilderness.
The following is a list of the villages of the Sagra; or champaign 
country of Toledo, already supplied with Testaments.
It will perhaps be expedient to print this list in the 
       Extracts.       



Vargas


Mocejon


Villa Seca




Cobeja


Villaluenga


Yuncler.



In about a week I shall depart from hence and proceed to another 
district, as it would not be prudent to make a long sojourn in any 
particular district under existing circumstances.       It is my intention 
to cross the country to Aranjuez, and endeavour to supply with the Word the
villages on the frontier of La Mancha.       Write to me as soon as 
possible, always directing to my lodgings in Madrid.       I wish to know 
the lowest price at which I am at liberty to dispose of Testaments, and 
conclude with hoping that what I have narrated will meet the approbation of
you all.

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Aug. 2nd, 1838)
Madrid, No. 16 Calle 
Santiago,
July 23, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       As, I was about to 
leave Villa Seca for Aranjuez I received your letters of the 3rd and 7th 
inst., on the perusal of which I instantly returned to Madrid instead of 
pursuing my intended route.
My answer will be very brief, as I am afraid of giving way to my 
feelings; I hope, however, that it will be to the purpose.
It is broadly hinted in yours of the 7th that I have made false 
statements in asserting that the Government, in consequence of what has 
lately taken place, had come to a resolution of seizing the Bible depots in
various parts of this country.
In reply, I beg leave to inform you that by the first courier you will 
receive from the British Legation at Madrid the official notice from Count 
Ofalia to Sir George Villiers of the seizures already made, and the motives
which induced the Government to have recourse to such a measure.
The following seizures have already been made, though some have not as 
yet been officially announced:
The Society       s books at Oviedo, Pontevedra, Salamanca, Santiago, 
Seville, and Valladolid.
It appears from your letters that the dep       ts in the south of Spain
have escaped.       I am glad of it, although it be at my own 
expense.       I see the hand of the Lord throughout the late 
transactions.       He is chastening me.       It is His pleasure that the 
guilty escape and the innocent be punished.       The Government give 
orders to seize the Bible dep       ts throughout the country on account of
the late scenes at Malaga and Valencia.       I have never been there, yet 
only my dep       ts are meddled with, as it appears!       The 
Lord       s will be done, blessed be the name of the Lord!
I will write again to-morrow.       I shall have then arranged my 
thoughts, and determined on the conduct which it becomes a Christian to 
pursue under these circumstances.       Permit me in conclusion to ask 
you:
Have you not to a certain extent been partial in this matter?       Have
you not, in the apprehension of being compelled to blame the conduct of 
one, who has caused me unutterable anxiety, misery, and persecution, and 
who has been the bane of the Bible cause in Spain, refused to receive the 
information which it was in your power to command?       I called on the 
Committee and yourself, from the first, to apply to Sir George Villiers; no
one is so well versed in what has lately been going on as himself.       
But no.       It was God       s will that I, who have risked all and lost 
almost all in the cause, be taunted, suspected, and the sweat of agony and 
tears which I have poured out be estimated at the value of the water of the
ditch or the moisture which exudes from rotten dung.       But I murmur 
not, and hope I shall at all times be willing to bow to the dispensations 
of the Almighty.
Sir George Villiers has returned to England for a short period; you have
therefore the opportunity of consulting him.       I will not leave 
Spain until the whole affair has been thoroughly sifted.       I shall then
perhaps appear and bid you an eternal farewell.
Four hundred Testaments have been disposed of in the Sagra of 
Toledo.
(Unsigned.)
P.S.       I am just returned from the Embassy, where I have had 
a long interview with that admirable person, Lord Wm. Hervey.       He has 
requested me to write him a letter on the point in question, which with the
official documents he intends to send to the Secretary of State in order to
be laid before the Bible Society.       He has put into my hands the last 
communication from Ofalia.       It relates to the seizure of my 
dep       ts at Malaga, Pontevedra, etc.       I have not opened it, but 
send it for your perusal.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd.       Aug. 14th,

No. 16 Calle Santiago,  span 
class="smcap">Madrid,
August 3, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Since writing to 
you last I have been at some distance from Madrid.       Indeed my affairs 
at the time were in such a condition and so much depended upon my personal 
superintendence, that I was obliged to depart almost immediately after 
dispatching my answers to your two last.       I am now returned 
principally on account of a rather unfortunate accident which occurred on 
the frontier of La Mancha, the particulars of which I shall give you 
presently.       I shall, however, only tarry sufficient time to rest the 
horses and again go forth, for I am but too well aware that no time must 
now be lost, my enemies being numerous and watchful.
On leaving Madrid I proceeded in the direction of Aranjuez, selling from
twenty to forty copies in every village that lay in the way or near it; my 
intention was to penetrate deep into La Mancha, and in that view I had 
forwarded a large supply of books to Aranjuez.       Having arrived there I
made a sojourn of three days, during which time, myself, [my] servant and 
Juan Lopez, of whom I have previously spoken to you, visited every house in
the town.       We found a vast deal of poverty and ignorance amongst the 
inhabitants, and experienced some opposition; nevertheless it pleased the 
Almighty to permit us to dispose of about eighty Testaments, which were 
purchased entirely by the very poor people, those in easier circumstances 
paying no attention to the Word of God, but rather turning it to scoff and 
ridicule.       One circumstance was very gratifying and cheering to me, 
namely, the ocular proof which I possessed that the books which I disposed 
of were read, and with attention, by those to whom I disposed of them, and 
that many others participated in their benefit.       In the streets of 
Aranjuez and beneath the mighty cedars and gigantic elms and plantains 
which compose its noble woods, I have frequently seen groups assembled, 
listening to individuals who, with the New Testament in their hands, were 
reading aloud the comfortable words of salvation.
It is probable that had I remained a longer period in Aranjuez I might 
have sold many more of our divine books, but I was eager to gain La Mancha 
and its sandy plains, and to conceal myself for a season amongst its 
solitary villages; for I was apprehensive that a storm was gathering around
me.       But when once through Oca        a, the frontier town, I knew 
well that I should have nothing to fear from the Spanish authorities as 
their power ceased there, the rest of La Mancha being almost entirely in 
the hands of the Carlists, and overrun by small parties of banditti, from 
whom however I trusted that the Lord would preserve me.       I therefore 
departed for Oca        a, situate about three leagues from Aranjuez.
I started with my servant about six in the evening, having early in the 
morning sent forward Lopez with between two and three hundred 
Testaments.       We left the high road and proceeded by a shorter way, 
through wild hills and over very broken and precipitous ground.       Being
well-mounted we found ourselves just after sunset opposite Oca        a, 
which stands on a steep hill.       A deep valley lay between us and the 
town; we descended and came to a small bridge which traverses a rivulet at 
the bottom of the valley, at a very small distance from a kind of suburb; 
we crossed the bridge, and were passing by a deserted house on our left 
hand when a man appeared from under the porch.
What I am about to state will seem incomprehensible to you, but a 
singular history and a singular people are connected with it.       The man
placed himself before my horse so as to bar the way, and said 
Schophon, which in the Hebrew tongue signifies a rabbit.       I 
knew this word to be one of the Jewish countersigns, and asked the man if 
he had anything to communicate.       He said:        You must not enter 
the town, for a net is prepared for you.       The Corregidor of 
Toledo, on whom may all evil light, in order to give pleasure to the 
priests of Maria, in whose face I spit, has ordered all the Alcaldes
of these parts and the Escribanos and the Corchetes to lay 
hands on you wherever they may find you, and to send you and your books and
all that pertains to you to Toledo.       Your servant was seized this 
morning in the town above as he was selling the writings in the streets, 
and they are now awaiting your arrival in the posada; but I knew you
from the accounts of my brethren, and have been waiting here four hours to 
give you warning, in order that your horse may turn his tail to your 
enemies and neigh in derision of them.       Fear nothing for your servant,
for he is known to the Alcalde and will be set at liberty, but do 
you flee, and may God attend you.              Having said this, he hurried
towards the town.
I hesitated not a moment to take his advice, knowing full well that, as 
my books had been taken possession of, I could do no more in that 
direction.       We turned back, in the direction of Aranjuez, the horses 
notwithstanding the nature of the ground galloping at full speed, and like 
the true Moorish breed bearing their tails erect and stiff; but our 
adventures were not over.       About mid-way, and about half a league from
the small village of Antigola, we saw close to us on our left hand three 
men on a low bank.       As far as the darkness would permit us to 
distinguish they were naked, but each bore in his hand a long gun; these 
were rateros, or the common assassins and robbers of the 
roads.       We halted, and cried out        Who goes there?        They, 
replied,        What       s that to you?       Pass by.              Their
drift was to fire at us from a position from which it would be impossible 
to miss.       We shouted:        If you do not instantly pass to the right
side of the road, we will tread you down beneath the horses        
hoofs.              They hesitated, and then obeyed, for all Spanish 
assassins are dastards, and the least show of resolution daunts them.      
As we galloped past, one cried with an obscene oath, 
       Tiraremos        (       fire       ) but another said, 
       No! hay peligro        [       there       s 
danger       ].       We reached Aranjuez, where early next morning Lopez 
rejoined us, and we returned to Madrid.
I am sorry to state that two hundred Testaments were seized at 
Oca        a, where they were sealed and despatched to Toledo.       Lopez 
informed me that in two hours he could have sold them all, the demand was 
so great; as it was, twenty-seven were sold in less than ten minutes.      
He is just departed on another expedition, and I am about to follow, for 
with God       s leave I will fight it out to the last.
I enclose you a list of all the towns and villages hitherto 
visited.       I have nothing more to say for the present, but that you may
make what use you please of this letter.
Such is my life in Spain.

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Sept. 12, 1838)
[Labajos, Province of 
Segovia,
Aug. 23rd, 1838.]
Revd. and dear Sir,       Lord William Hervey
was perfectly satisfied with my conduct in the affair stated on the other 
side, and so was Count Ofalia, who expressed his regret that circumstances 
had compelled her Majesty       s Government to take those steps against 
the circulation of the Scriptures with which you are already 
acquainted.
G. B.
Copy of Letter to the Right Hon. Lord William Hervey
Labajos,  span 
class="smcap">Province of Segovia,
August 23rd, 1838.
My Lord,       I beg leave to call your 
attention to the following facts.       On the 21st instant I received 
information that a person in my employ of the name of Juan Lopez had been 
thrown into the prison of Villallos, in the province of Avila, by order of 
the Cura of that place.       The crime with which he was charged 
was selling the New Testament.       At the time I alluded to, I was at 
Labajos, in the province of Segovia, and the division of the factious 
chieftain Balmaseda was in the immediate neighbourhood.       On the 22nd, 
I mounted my horse and rode to Villallos, a distance of three 
leagues.       On my arrival there, I found that Lopez had been removed 
from the prison to a private house.       An order had arrived from the 
Corregidor of Avila, commanding that the person of Lopez should be 
placed in full and perfect liberty and that the books which had been found 
in his possession should be alone detained.       Nevertheless, in direct 
opposition to this order, a copy of which I herewith transmit, the 
Alcalde of Villallos, at the instigation of the Cura, refused
to permit the said Lopez to quit the place, either to proceed to Avila or 
in any other direction.       It had been hinted to Lopez that, as the 
factious were expected, it was intended on their arrival to denounce him to
them as a liberal, and to cause him to be sacrificed.       Taking these 
circumstances into consideration, I deemed it my duty, as a Christian and a
gentleman, to rescue my unfortunate servant from such lawless bands, and in
consequence defying opposition I bore him off, though perfectly unarmed, 
through a crowd of at least one hundred peasants.       On leaving the 
place I shouted        Viva Isabela Segunda.       
As it is my belief that the Cura of Villallos is a person capable
of any infamy, I beg leave humbly to entreat your Lordship to cause a copy 
of the above narration to be forwarded to the Spanish Government.
I have the honour to remain, my Lord, your Lordship       s most 
obedient and most humble servant,
George Borrow.

Revd. and dear Sir,       I am this moment 
arrived at Madrid from my expedition in Old Castile, and I have received 
your kind lines appended to my friend Mr. Brandram       s 
communication.
I will set out for England as soon as possible; but I must be allowed 
time.       I am almost dead with fatigue, suffering and anxiety; and it is
necessary that I should place the Society       s property in safe and sure
custody.
It has pleased the Lord to assist me visibly in my last journey.       
In the midst of a thousand perils I have disposed of nine hundred 
Testaments amongst the peasantry on the north side of the precipitous hills
of the Guadarama range, and all in the space of three weeks.       In a day
or two I shall write to Mr. Brandram with particulars.
Pray excuse these hasty lines; present my kindest remembrances to Mrs. 
Browne, and believe me, Revd. and dear Sir,
Gratefully and truly yours,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram

Madrid, Sept. 1, 1838.
Revd. and dear Sir,       From my letter to 
the Revd. Geo. Browne of the 28 ult. you are already doubtless aware of my 
arrival at Madrid from my expedition in Old Castile.       I now proceed to
detail to you a few occurrences, premising that my notices will necessarily
be brief, as I am considerably indisposed, and am moreover much occupied in
making preparations for my departure for England, and in arranging the 
affairs of the Society in Spain in as satisfactory a manner as 
circumstances will permit.
I set out for my journey on the 4th of last month on horseback and 
accompanied by my servant.       The first day brought us to La Granja, a 
distance of twelve leagues from Madrid, where I expected to find Lopez and 
another man whom I had sent before.       Nothing particular occurred 
during this day       s journey, except that notwithstanding my haste I 
sold some Testaments in the villages near the roadside and that it pleased 
God to permit us to traverse the pass of Pe        a Cerrada without coming
in contact with the banditti that haunt the gloomy pine forests which 
embower it and extend for leagues in every direction.       Arrived at La 
Granja, I could hear nothing of Lopez nor of the other individual, and in 
consequence after a stay of a day which was necessary to refresh the 
horses, I departed for Segovia.       I did not attempt to distribute the 
Word at La Granja, being well aware that orders had been transmitted to the
authorities of the place to seize all copies of the sacred writings which 
might be offered for sale.       I may say the same with respect to 
Segovia, where still none of my people made their appearance.       At 
Segovia I received from a friend a chest containing two hundred Testaments,
and almost immediately after, by the greatest chance in the world, I heard 
from a peasant that there were men in the neighbourhood of Abades selling 
books.       Abades is about three leagues distant from Segovia, and upon 
receiving this intelligence I instantly departed for the former place, with
three burricos [asses] laden with Testaments.
I reached Abades at nightfall, and found Lopez in the house of the 
surgeon of the place, where I also took up my residence.       He had 
already disposed of a considerable number of Testaments in the 
neighbourhood, and had that day commenced selling at Abades itself.       
He had, however, been interrupted by two of three Curas of the 
village, who with horrid curses denounced the work, threatening eternal 
condemnation to Lopez for selling it and to any person who should purchase 
it; whereupon Lopez, terrified, forebore until I should arrive.       The 
third Cura, however, exerted himself to the utmost to persuade the 
people to provide themselves with Testaments, telling them that his 
brethren were hypocrites and false guides, who by keeping them in ignorance
of the word and will of Christ were leading them to the abyss.       Upon 
receiving this information, I instantly sallied forth to the marketplace, 
and that same night succeeded in disposing of upwards of thirty 
Testaments.       The next morning the house was entered by the two 
factious Curas; but upon my rising to confront them they retreated, 
and I heard no more of them, except that they publicly cursed me in the 
church more than once, an event which as no ill resulted from it gave me 
little concern.
I will not detail the events of the next week; suffice it to say that 
arranging my forces in the most advantageous way I succeeded by God       s
assistance in disposing of in that period from five to six hundred 
Testaments amongst the villages from one to seven leagues distance from 
Abades.       At the expiration of that period I received information from 
Segovia, in which province Abades is situated, to the effect that my 
proceedings were known in Segovia, and that an order was about to be sent 
to the Alcalde of Abades to seize all books in my possession.       
Whereupon, notwithstanding that it was late in the evening, I decamped with
all my people and upwards of three hundred Testaments, having a few hours 
previously received a fresh supply from Madrid.       That night we passed 
in the fields and next morning proceeded to Labajos, a village on the high 
road from Madrid to Valladolid.       In this place we offered no books for
sale, but contented ourselves with supplying the neighbouring villages with
the Word of God; we likewise sold it in the highways.       We had not been
at Labajos a week, during which time we were remarkably successful, when 
the Carlist chieftain Balmaseda at the head of his wild cavalry made his 
desperate inroad into the southern part of Old Castile, dashing down like 
an avalanche from the pine woods of Soria.       I was present at all the 
horrors which ensued       the sack of Arrevalo       and the forcible 
entry into Martin Mu        oz and San Cyrian.       Amidst these terrible 
scenes, we continued our labours undaunted, with the exception of my 
servant, who seized with uncontrollable fear ran away to Madrid.       I 
now lost Lopez for three or four days, and suffered dreadful anxiety on his
account, apprehending that he had been shot by the Carlists.       At last 
I heard that he was in prison at Villallos, at the distance of three 
leagues.       The steps which I took to rescue him you will find detailed 
in the communication which I deemed it my duty to transmit to Lord Wm. 
Hervey at Madrid, a copy of which, together with the letter of Lopez which 
informed me of his situation, I transmit herewith.       After the rescue 
of Lopez, I thought it advisable to return to Madrid, more especially as my
stock of Testaments was exhausted, we having in the course of little more 
than a fortnight disposed of nearly nine hundred Testaments       not in 
populous and wealthy towns but in highways and villages, not to the 
spurious Spaniards of Madrid and the coasts, but to the sun-blackened 
peasantry of Old Castile, the genuine descendants of those terrible men who
subjugated Mexico and Peru.
My men returned by Pe        a Cerrada, whilst I, encumbered by two 
horses, crossed the Guadarama.       I nearly perished there, having lost 
my way in the darkness and tumbled down a precipice.       But I am now in 
Madrid and, if not well, trusting in the Lord and defying Satan.       I 
shall probably be in England within three weeks.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, truly yours,
G. B.

Revd. and dear Sir,       I write this to 
inform you that for the last ten days I have been confined to my bed by a 
fever.       I am now better, and hope in a few days to be able to proceed 
to Saragossa, which is the only road open.
I bore up against my illness as long as I could, but it became too 
powerful for me.       By good fortune I obtained a decent physician, a Dr.
Hacayo, who had studied medicine in England, and aided by him and the 
strength of my constitution I got the better of my attack, which however 
was a dreadfully severe one.
I hope my next letter will be from Bordeaux.       I cannot write more 
at present, for I am very feeble.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, truly yours,
G. Borrow.
Account of Proceedings in the Peninsula
Gentlemen of the Committee of the British and 
Foreign Bible Society       
I beg leave to call your attention to the following statements.       
They relate to my proceedings during the period which embraces my second 
sojourn in Spain       to my labours in a literary point of view       to 
my travels in a very remarkable country, the motive in which they 
originated and the result to which they led       to my success in the 
distribution of the Scripture, and to the opposition and encouragement 
which I have experienced.       As my chief objects are brevity and 
distinctness I shall at once enter upon my subject, abstaining from 
reflections of every kind, which in most cases only tend to embarrass, 
being anxious to communicate facts alone, with most of which, it is true, 
you are already tolerably well acquainted, but upon all and every of which 
I am eager to be carefully and categorically questioned.       It is 
neither my wish nor my interest to conceal one particular of what I have 
been doing.       And with these few prefatory observations I commence.
In the first place, my literary labours.       Having on my former visit
to Spain obtained from the then Prime Minister Isturitz and his Cabinet 
permission and encouragement for the undertaking, I published on my return 
an edition of the New Testament at Madrid, a copy of which I now present to
you for the first time.       This work, executed at the office of Borrego,
the most fashionable printer at Madrid, who had been recommended to me by 
Isturitz himself and most particularly by my excellent friend Mr. 
O       Shea, is a publication which I conceive no member of the Committee 
will consider as calculated to cast discredit on the Bible Society, it 
being printed on excellent English paper and well bound, but principally 
and above all from the fact of its exhibiting scarcely one typographical 
error, every proof having been read thrice by myself and once or more times
by the first scholar in Spain.
I subsequently published the Gospel of Saint Luke in the Rommany and 
Biscayan languages.       With respect to the first, I beg leave to observe
that no work printed in Spain ever caused so great and so general a 
sensation, not so much amongst the Gypsies, that peculiar people, for whom 
it was intended, as amongst the Spaniards themselves, who, though they look
upon the Roma with some degree of contempt as a low and thievish race of 
outcasts, nevertheless take a strange interest in all that concerns them, 
it having been from time immemorial their practice, more especially of the 
dissolute young nobility, to cultivate the acquaintance of the Gitanos as 
they are popularly called, probably attracted by the wild wit of the latter
and the lascivious dances of the females.       The apparition therefore of
the Gospel of Saint Luke at Madrid in the peculiar jargon of these people 
was hailed as a strange novelty and almost as a wonder, and I believe was 
particularly instrumental in bruiting the name of the Bible Society far and
wide through Spain, and in creating a feeling far from inimical towards it 
and its proceedings.       I will here take the liberty to relate an 
anecdote illustrative of the estimation in which this little work was held 
at Madrid.       The Committee are already aware that a seizure was made of
many copies of Saint Luke in the Rommany and Biscayan languages, in the 
establishment at which they were exposed for sale, which copies were 
deposited in the office of the Civil Governor.       Shortly before my 
departure a royal edict was published, authorising all the public libraries
to provide themselves with copies of the said works on account of their 
philological merit; whereupon, on application being made to the office, it 
was discovered that the copies of the Gospel in Basque were safe and 
forthcoming, whilst every one of the sequestered copies of the Gitano 
Gospel had been plundered by hands unknown.       The consequence was that 
I was myself applied to by then agents of the public libraries of Valencia 
and other places, who paid me the price of the copies which they received, 
assuring me at the same time that they were authorised to purchase them at 
whatever price which might be demanded.
Respecting the Gospel in Basque I have less to say.       It was 
originally translated into the dialect of Guipuscoa by Dr. Oteiza, and 
subsequently received corrections and alterations from myself.       It can
scarcely be said to have been published, it having been prohibited and 
copies of it seized on the second day of its appearance.       But it is in
my power to state that it is anxiously expected in the Basque provinces, 
where books in the aboriginal tongue are both scarce and dear, and that 
several applications have been made at San Sebastian and in other towns 
where Basque is the predominating language.
I now proceed to the subject of my travels in Spain.       Before 
undertaking them I was little acquainted with the genius of the Spanish 
people in general, having resided almost entirely in Madrid, and I was 
fully convinced that it was not from the inhabitants of one city that an 
accurate judgment could be formed of a population of nine millions, thinly 
scattered over a vast country so divided and intersected by mountain 
barriers as is the Peninsula.       With this population under all its 
various circumstances and under all its various phases, the result of 
descent from a variety of foreign nations, I was anxious to make myself 
acquainted; for I reflected that he who builds a city on ground which he 
has not fully examined will perhaps discover when too late that his 
foundation is in a swamp, and that the whole of his labour is momentarily 
in danger of being swallowed up.       I therefore went forth not so much 
for the purpose of distributing the Scriptures as to make myself acquainted
with the prefatory steps requisite to be taken in order to secure my grand 
object.       Before departing from Madrid I consulted with the many 
friends, some of them highly distinguished, which I had the honour to 
possess in that capital.       Their unanimous advice, whether Catholics or
Protestants, was that for the present I should proceed with the utmost 
caution, but without concealing the object of my mission which I considered
to be the simple propagation of the Scripture       that I should avoid 
with diligence the giving offence to the prejudices of the people, 
especially in the rural districts, and endeavour everywhere to keep on good
terms with the clergy, at least one-third of whom are known to be anxious 
for the dissemination of the Word of God though at the same time unwilling 
to separate themselves from the discipline and ceremonials of Rome.       I
bore this advice in mind, which indeed perfectly tallied with my own ideas,
and throughout the two thousand miles of my peregrination during the summer
of last year, I performed much if not all of what I proposed, and am not 
aware that in one single instance my proceedings were such as could 
possibly merit reproof.       I established dep       ts in all the 
principal towns of the north of Spain, and in all gave notice to the public
of the arrival of the New Testament in a mild yet expressive advertisement 
which I here exhibit, and which I beg leave to state is the only 
advertisement which I ever made use of.       The consequence was that the 
work enjoyed a reasonable sale, and I experienced no 
opposition       except in the case of Leon, a town remarkable for its 
ultra-Carlism       but on the contrary much encouragement especially on 
the part of the ecclesiastics.       I visited Salamanca and Valladolid the
chief seats of Castilian learning, I visited Saint James of Compostella, 
the temple of the great image of the Patron of Spain, and in none of these 
cities was a single voice raised against the Bible Society or its 
Agent.       But I did not confine myself to the towns, but visited the 
small and large villages, and by this means became acquainted with both 
citizens and rustics; amongst the former I found little desire for sober 
serious reading, but on the contrary a rage for stimulant narratives, and 
amongst too many a lust for the deistical writings of the French, 
especially for those of Talleyrand, which have been translated into Spanish
and published by the press of Barcelona, and for which I was frequently 
pestered.       I several times enquired of the book-sellers of the various
towns which I visited as to the means to be used towards introducing the 
Scripture amongst the villagers; but to this question they invariably 
replied that, unless the villagers came to the towns and purchased the 
work, they saw no means of making it known amongst them, unless I made 
friends in the villages in whose hands I could deposit copies for sale, 
though in such a case the difficulty of recovering the money would be 
immense.       I therefore at last resolved to make an experiment, the 
result of which fully corresponded with an opinion which I had for some 
time formed       namely, that in the villages, sequestered and apart 
amongst the mountains and in the sandy plains of Spain, I might at any time
be sure of a glorious harvest, far more rich than that which it was 
possible for me to expect in towns and cities, unless I had recourse to 
means unwarranted, nay forbidden, by the Book which I distributed, and 
which means had been proscribed by the Society itself on my departure for 
Spain.       But now to proceed at once to the experiment, which I made at 
different periods and in different provinces.
I twice sallied forth one morning alone and on horseback, and proceeded 
to a distant village, bearing behind me a satchel of books.       On my 
arrival, which took place just after the siesta or afternoon       s
sleep had concluded, I proceeded in both instances to the market-place, 
where I spread a horse-cloth on the ground, on which I deposited my 
books.       I then commenced crying with a loud voice:        Peasants, 
peasants, I bring you the Word of God at a cheap price.       I know you 
have but little money, but I bring it to you at whatever you can command, 
at four or three reals according to your means.              I thus 
went on till a crowd gathered round me, who examined the book with 
attention, many of them reading it aloud.       But I had not long to 
tarry; in both instances I disposed of my cargo almost instantaneously, and
then mounted my horse without a question having been asked me, and returned
to my temporary residence lighter than I left it.       This occurred in 
Castile and Galicia, near the towns of Santiago and Valladolid.
The above are incidents which I have hitherto kept within the privacy of
my own bosom and which I have confided to none; they were but experiments, 
which at that time I had no wish to repeat, nor to be requested so to 
do.       I was perfectly aware that such a line of conduct, if followed 
before the proper time, would give offence to the clergy, not only to the 
Carlist but the liberal clergy, and likewise to the Government; and it 
formed no part of my plan to be on ill terms with either.       For I 
remembered that I was a stranger and a labourer on sufferance in 
Christ       s cause in a half-barbaric land, on which the light of freedom
and true religion was just beginning to dawn, and I was unwilling by 
over-precipitance and for the sake of a mere temporary triumph to forego 
the solid and lasting advantages which I foresaw, and had been told that 
patience and prudence would assure.       I resolved to use the knowledge 
which I had obtained by these experiments only as a last resource, provided
any accident which it was impossible for me then to foresee should overturn
all the plans which my friends and myself had been forming for the quiet 
and peaceful introduction of the Scriptures amongst the Spaniards with the 
consent or at least with the connivance of the Government and clergy, 
knowing well that a great part of the latter were by no means disposed to 
offer any serious opposition to such a measure, they having sense and 
talent enough to perceive that the old system can no longer be upheld of 
which the essential part is, as is well known, to keep the people in 
ignorance of the great sterling truths of Christianity.       I now come to
the most distressing part of my narrative and likewise to the most 
miserable of my own life.
I returned to Madrid from my long, fatiguing and most perilous journey, 
in which I must be permitted to say that independent of a thousand 
miraculous escapes from the factious and the banditti I had been twice 
arrested as a spy, namely, once at Vigo and subsequently at Cape 
Finisterre, in which latter instance I narrowly escaped with life, the 
ignorant fishermen having determined upon shooting me and my guide.       
Upon finding the booksellers of Madrid, with the exception of Razola, a man
of no importance, averse to undertake the sale of the New Testament I 
determined upon establishing a shop of my own, a step to which I was 
advised by many sincere friends of the Cause and of myself.       Having 
accomplished this, I advertised the work incessantly, not only in the 
public prints but by placards posted in all the streets of the city; but I 
wish it to be distinctly understood that the advertisement which I used was
the same quiet innocent advertisement, a copy of which you possess, and of 
which I have availed myself in the provinces, an advertisement which had 
never given offence nor was calculated to give offence if squandered about 
the streets by millions.       I make this statement in self-justification,
I having, in consequence of a letter in which I made some observations 
respecting advertisements and handbills, received a paragraph in a 
communication from home, in which I was checked with having made a 
plentiful use of advertisements and handbills myself.       It would have 
been as well if my respected and revered friend the writer had made himself
acquainted with the character of my advertisements before he made that 
observation.       There is no harm in an advertisement, if truth, decency 
and the fear of God are observed; and I believe my own will be scarcely 
found deficient in any of these three requisites.       It is not the use 
of a serviceable instrument, but its abuse that merits reproof, and I 
cannot conceive that advertising was abused by me when I informed the 
people of Madrid, that the New Testament was to be purchased at a cheap 
price in the Calle del Principe.
I had scarcely opened my establishment at Madrid when I began to hear 
rumours of certain transactions at Valencia, said to be encouraged by the 
British and Foreign Bible Society.       As these transactions, as they 
were reported, were in the highest degree absurd and improper, and as I was
convinced that the Bible Society would sanction nothing of the kind, I 
placed little or no credit in them, and put them down to the account of 
Jesuitical malignity.       In less than a fortnight appeared in the 
newspapers what I conceived to be a gross and uncalled-for attack upon the 
Bible Society, appended to a pastoral of the Bishop of Valencia, in which 
he forbade the sale of the Bible throughout his diocese.       The 
Committee are acquainted with my answer to that epistle; they are well 
aware with what zeal and fervour I spoke against the spirit of Popery, and 
defended the Society and their cause as far as my feeble talents would 
permit.       Yet I here confess that the said answer was penned, if not in
perfect ignorance of what had been transacted in Valencia, at least in 
almost utter disbelief; for had it been my fortune at the time to have been
as well informed as I have subsequently been, so far from publishing the 
answer in question I would at once have publicly disclaimed, as I 
afterwards did, any participation or sympathy in transactions which were 
not only calculated to bring the Bible cause into odium, but the Bible 
Society into difficulties, into discredit, and worst of all, into 
contempt.       A helpless widow was insulted, her liberty of conscience 
invaded, and her only son incited to rebellion against her.       A lunatic
was employed as the repartidor or distributor of the blessed Bible, 
who having his head crammed with what he understood not, ran through the 
streets of Valencia crying aloud that Christ was nigh at hand and would 
appear in a short time; whilst advertisements to much the same effect were 
busily circulated in which the name, the noble name, of the Bible Society 
was prostituted; whilst the Bible exposed for sale in an apartment of a 
public house served for little more than a decoy to the idle and curious, 
who were there treated with incoherent railings against the Church of Rome 
and Babylon, in a dialect which it was well for the deliverer that only a 
few of the audience understood.       But I fly from these details, and 
will now repeat the consequences of the above proceedings to myself; for I,
I, and only I, as every respectable person in Madrid can vouch, have paid 
the penalty for them all, though as innocent as the babe who has not yet 
seen the light.
I had much difficulty at Madrid, principally on account of the state of 
political matters which absorbed the minds of all, in bringing the New 
Testament into notice.       However by dint of perseverance I contrived to
direct the public curiosity towards it, indeed I was beginning to average a
sale of twenty copies daily, when the shop was suddenly closed by order of 
the Government in consequence of the complaints from Valencia, myself being
supposed to be the instigator and director of the scenes in that place 
already narrated.       For the next four months I carried on negotiations 
with the Government through the medium of Sir George Villiers, who from my 
first arrival in the Peninsula, had most generously befriended me.       
But in his endeavours to forward my views he found exceeding 
difficulties.       The clergy were by this time, both Carlist and liberal,
thoroughly incensed against me, and indeed with much apparent reason; the 
former denounced me to the populace as a sorcerer and a heretic, and the 
latter spoke of me as an accomplished hypocrite.       I was at last flung 
into prison       into the pestilential Carcel de la Corte, where my
faithful servant Francisco caught the gaol-fever, of which he subsequently 
died.       But in this instance my enemies committed a very imprudent act,
an act which had very nearly produced the result for which I had been so 
long unsuccessfully negotiating.       My protector, Sir George Villiers, 
informed the Spanish Prime Minister, Ofalia, that unless full satisfaction 
was offered me, he should deem it his duty to cease any further 
transactions with the Spanish Government, and to order all the British land
and sea-forces, co-operating with those of the Queen to terminate the 
rebellion, to desist from further operations.
I was about to obtain all I wished, when at the critical moment the news
of the scenes at Malaga arrived at Madrid, and Sir George had little more 
to say than that Satan seemed to mingle in this game.       Nevertheless I 
left prison, with the understanding that the Government would connive at 
the circulation of the Scriptures in a quiet manner, not calculated to 
produce disturbances nor to give scandal to the clergy.
But speedily followed the affair of the sectarian tracts of Carthagena, 
which tracts were sworn to as having been left there by agents of the Bible
Society; and I instantly knew that I had nothing more to expect from the 
Government.       But some time previous I had formed an unalterable 
resolution that, come what might, I would no longer bear the odium of 
actions, which in whatever motive they originated had already subjected me 
to unheard-of persecution, loathsome imprisonment, loss of friends, and to 
the grief of seeing prudent and long-brooded plans baffled and brought to 
nought, and the Society to which I belonged subjected to opprobrium as I 
believed undeserved; and I therefore published in the journals of Madrid an
advertisement, in which I disowned, in my own name and that of the Society,
any sympathy with the actor or actors in those transactions, which had 
given so much cause of offence to the authorities, civil and ecclesiastic, 
of Spain.
My principal reason for taking this step originated from my having 
become personally acquainted with the ex-priest Pascual Marin, who arrived 
at Madrid the very day in which I was committed to prison.       His 
narrative served to confirm all the rumours which I had previously 
heard.       The Committee are fully aware with what unwillingness I formed
the acquaintance of that man, who was sent up to me in order that I might 
provide for him, without my consent being obtained or even demanded; but I 
now rejoice in the circumstance, without which I might still have been 
playing the odious, disgraceful, and heart-breaking part which I had 
supported so long.       But by the decided step which I now took, the 
burden of obloquy fell at once from my shoulders, as the bundle of sin from
the back of Christian, and rolling into a deep pit was seen no more.
That advertisement gave infinite satisfaction to the liberal 
clergy.       I was complimented for it by the Primate of Spain, who said I
had redeemed my credit and that of the Society; and it is with some feeling
of pride that I state that it choked and prevented the publication of a 
series of terrible essays against the Bible Society, which were intended 
for the official Gazette, and which were written by the Licentiate Albert 
Lister, the editor of that journal, the friend of Blanco White, and the 
most talented man in Spain.       These essays still exist in the editorial
drawer, and were communicated to me by the head manager of the royal 
printing office, my respected friend and countryman Mr. Charles Wood, whose
evidence in this matter and in many others I can command at pleasure.      
In lieu of which essays came out a mild and conciliatory article by the 
same writer, which, taking into consideration the country in which it was 
written and its peculiar circumstances, was an encouragement to the Bible 
Society to proceed, although with secrecy and caution.       Yet this 
article, sadly misunderstood in England, gave rise to communications from 
home highly mortifying to myself and ruinous to the Bible cause.
In the meantime my dep       ts had been seized in various parts of 
Spain, dep       ts the greatest part of which I had established with 
immense difficulty and peril, some of them being in the remote and almost 
inaccessible province of Galicia, at the distance of almost four hundred 
miles from Madrid.       I now deemed that the time was at hand to avail 
myself of my resource, and to sell at all risks the Testament amongst the 
peasantry of Spain, by whom I knew that it would be received with transport
and with gratitude.       I determined to commence with the Sagra of 
Toledo, where resided an honest labourer of my acquaintance; my foot was in
the stirrup when I received a letter from home, which I can only consider 
as having originated with the Enemy of mankind for the purpose of 
perplexing my already harassed and agitated mind.       In this letter I 
was told, amongst other matter which I need not repeat, to prepare to quit 
Spain.       But by the shaft I knew the quiver from which it came, and, 
merely exclaiming,        Satan, I defy thee,        I hurried to Sagra, 
and disposed of amongst the peasantry in one fortnight four hundred copies 
of the New Testament.       But it is hard to wrestle with the great Enemy;
another shaft arrived in the shape of a letter, which compelled me to 
return to Madrid, whilst the cause of God was beckoning me to Aranjuez and 
La Mancha, to which places I indeed hurried as soon as I had arranged 
matters at Madrid.
Without losing time or being dispirited by the events of the last 
journey, I repaired to Old Castile; here my success was almost miraculous, 
nine hundred copies of the Holy Book being sold in less than three weeks, 
but not in peace and tranquillity, as the province became suddenly a scene 
of horrors which I shall not attempt to describe.       It was not the war 
of men, or even of cannibals, which I witnessed; it seemed a contest of 
fiends from the infernal pit.       But God guided me safe and unharmed 
through this        valley of the shadow,        and permitted me to regain
Madrid; where, upon finding myself formally recalled, I deposited the 
Society       s property in as safe a place as I could find, and was about 
to return home when a fever which had been long lurking in my blood at last
prostrated me, confining me to my bed for many days, at the expiration of 
which, though very unfit for travel, I departed for England, where at last 
by God       s will I am arrived in safety.
Before concluding, I have a communication to make, the importance of 
which few, I believe, will be tempted to deny.
I have at various times stated that the Bible Cause had many and 
powerful friends in Spain, though my statements up to the present moment 
seem to have been hailed with little attention.       I remember in one 
particular letter recommending prudence, patience, and co-operation with 
the liberal clergy, who were sincerely disposed to help us on, provided 
that by intemperateness of conduct we gave them no reasonable ground for 
offence.       There is now a society formed at Madrid, determined upon 
making the Word of God, without note or comment, known amongst the children
of Spain.       The laws concerning the publishing the Scripture have been 
diligently and minutely examined, and it has been discovered that by none 
of the laws of Spain, ancient or modern, whether made by Cortes or by 
kings, is the publication of the Scripture, in the whole or in parts, with 
or without comment, forbidden       but merely and solely by particular 
Bulls of various Bishops of Rome, which Bulls though respected by many of 
the Spaniards form no part of the law of Spain.       Provided resistance 
be offered to the undertaking either by the Government or any portion of 
the ecclesiastics, it has been determined to bring the matter before the 
Cortes, from whom a favourable decision may be expected with 
certainty.       An individual has been selected as the ostensible manager 
of this great and glorious undertaking, this individual is Mr. C. Wood, 
whom I have already had occasion to mention, though it is in my power to 
state that but for the manner in which the name of the Bible Society has on
various occasions been brought before the public, and almost invariably to 
its disadvantage, myself its well-known Agent, would have been the person 
selected.       If it be here asked who are the respectable and influential
persons who are at the head of this undertaking and who patronise it, I 
reply the Archbishop of Toledo, the Primate of Spain, and the Bishops of 
Vich and Jaen.
Now merely one word in conclusion.       I have related facts, and to 
attempt to contravene them would be as futile as to endeavour to breast the
billows of the Atlantic.       For the fact that I have throughout my 
residence in Spain conducted myself as becomes a gentleman, a Christian and
an Agent of a Christian Society, I can at all times command the evidence of
Sir George Villiers.       For the fact that no act of mine has given 
offence to the Spanish Government, or was calculated to do so, I can, if 
required, produce a communication from Count Ofalia, who has in writing 
expressed to Sir George Villiers his full reliance in my prudence and good 
faith.       For the fact that the establishment at Madrid was closed, not 
in consequence of my own imprudence, but on account of certain proceedings 
at Valencia, I can receive, if I need it, a testimonial from Count 
Ofalia.       For the fact that proceedings of a highly objectionable 
nature were transacted in the south of Spain, I have the affidavit of the 
unhappy ex-priest Pascual Marin, who can likewise afford, when called upon,
information on various points.       For the fact that my dep       ts in 
various provinces of Spain were seized in consequence of doings with which 
I had no connexion, I can cite official correspondence.       For the fact 
that my advertisement, in which I disowned in the name of the Society and 
in my own any sympathy with the scenes alluded to, was productive of 
infinite benefit to the Cause, I can at any time produce incontestable 
evidence.       And lastly, for my zeal in the Bible Cause, whilst employed
in the Peninsula, I can have the evidence not only of some of the most 
illustrious characters resident in Madrid, but likewise that of the 
greatest part of Spain, throughout which I believe my name is better known 
than in my native village in East Anglia.
Mr. G. Borrow       s Report on Past and Future Operations in Spain br 
/>
(Endorsed: recd. Nov. 28, 1838)
London, 
Novr. 1838.
Having been requested to commit to paper my opinion respecting the mode 
most advisable to be adopted for the propagation of the Word of God in 
Spain, provided the Committee of the Bible Society should consider it their
duty to resume operations in that country, I shall as briefly as possible 
communicate the results of an experience which three years        residence
has enabled me to acquire.       The Committee are already aware that I 
have traversed the greatest part of Spain in all directions, and have lived
for a considerable time in Madrid and other large towns.       I have 
therefore had opportunities of forming a tolerably accurate idea as to the 
mode of thinking upon religious subjects of the Spaniards, whether of town 
or country, and of their character in general.       I need not enter into 
a repetition of my labours during my last sojourn in Spain.       It is 
well known that, after printing the New Testament at Madrid, I endeavoured 
to distribute it in the principal towns, and also in the rural 
districts.       Particular circumstances prevented my experiencing in the 
former the success which I had hoped for, and with some reason, at the 
commencement of my Biblical labours; and indeed I did not find the minds of
the inhabitants of the great cities which I visited so well disposed as I 
could have wished, for receiving and relishing the important but simple 
truths of the Bible.       I cannot say that a spirit of fanatic bigotry 
was observable amongst them, except in a very few instances, but rather of 
lamentable indifference; their minds being either too much engrossed by the
politics of the period to receive the doctrine of the Bible, or averse to 
it owing to the poison of infidelity imbibed from the deistical writings of
the French.       My success among the peasants was however very different,
nearly two thousand copies having been disposed of in an extraordinarily 
short space of time, and under much disadvantage owing to the peculiarly 
unhappy situation of those parts which it was my fortune to visit.       I 
will now, without further preamble, state the line of conduct which I 
should wish to see pursued in Spain under existing circumstances.
As the minds of the inhabitants of the cities, from the causes above 
stated, do not appear to be exactly prepared for the reception of the 
Scripture, it seems most expedient for some time to come to offer it 
principally to the peasantry, by the greater part of whom there is so much 
ground for believing that it will be received with gratitude and joy.      
True it is that the Spanish peasantry are in general not so well educated 
as their brethren of the cities, their opportunities of acquiring a 
knowledge of letters having always been inferior; nevertheless it would be 
difficult to enter a cottage of which at least one of the inmates could not
read, more or less.       They are moreover a serious people, and any book 
upon religious subjects is far more certain of captivating their attention 
than one of a lighter character, and, above all, their minds have hitherto 
never been tainted by those unhappy notions of infidelity too prevalent 
amongst the other class.       There is one feature which I wish to mention
here, which is indeed common to the Spanish people in general but more 
particularly to the peasantry, namely, that whenever a book is purchased, 
whether good or bad, the purchaser entertains a firm intention of reading 
it, which he almost invariably puts into execution.       I do not make 
this observation merely upon hearsay       though I have frequently heard 
it from quarters which I am bound to respect       many examples tending to
substantiate the fact having come under my own knowledge.       It is at 
least a great consolation to the distributor of the Word of God in Spain, 
that the seed which he casts around him is in general received by the earth
beneath the surface, from which he is induced to trust that it will some 
day spring up and produce good fruit.
I now beg leave to repeat from a previous communication the manner in 
which I made my first attempt to distribute the Scriptures amongst the 
peasantry.       I must here remind the Committee that until [I] myself 
solved the problem of the possibility, no idea had been entertained of 
introducing the Bible in the rural districts of countries exclusively 
Papist.       This remark, which I make with the utmost humility, merely 
springs from an idea that a similar attempt, if made with boldness and 
decision, might prove equally successful in Italy, Mexico, and many other 
countries, even pagan, which have not yet been penetrated, particularly 
China and Grand Tartary, on the shores of which the Bible labours under 
great disadvantage and odium from being put into the hands of the natives 
by people seemingly in connection with those for whom it is impossible they
can entertain much respect, as they are well known to contribute largely 
towards the corruption of the public morals.       But I now return to my 
subject, and proceed at once to the experiment which I made at different 
periods and in different provinces.
I twice sallied forth alone and on horseback, and bent my course to a 
distant village.       On my arrival, which took place just after the 
siesta or afternoon       s nap had concluded, I proceeded in both 
instances to the market-place, where I spread a horse-cloth on the ground, 
upon which I deposited my books.       I then commenced crying with a loud 
voice:        Peasants, peasants, I bring you the Word of God at a cheap 
price.       I know you have but little money, but I bring it you at 
whatever you can command, at four or three reals, according to your 
means.              I thus went on till a crowd gathered round me, who 
examined the books with attention, many of them reading aloud, but I had 
not long to wait.       In both instances my cargo was disposed of almost 
instantaneously, and I mounted my horse without a question being asked me, 
and returned to my temporary abode lighter than I came.       These 
instances occurred in Castile and Galicia, near the towns of Santiago and 
Valladolid.
It is the firm conviction of the writer from subsequent experience that 
every village in Spain will purchase Testaments, from twenty to sixty, 
according to its circumstances.       During the last two months of his 
sojourn in Spain he visited about forty villages, and in only two instances
was his sale less than thirty copies in each.       The two villages which 
he alludes to were Mocejon in the Sagra of Toledo, and Torre Lodones about 
four leagues from Madrid in the road which leads to the Guadarama 
hills.       The last village is indeed a mere wretched assemblage of huts,
the inhabitants of which labour under the most squalid poverty, owing to 
the extreme niggardness of the neighbouring soil, which consists almost 
entirely of rock from which scarcely anything can be gathered, so that the 
people are proverbially thieves.       Only three copies of the sacred 
volume were purchased in this unhappy place, and only nine in the 
comparatively rich village of Mocejon       which, it is true, was visited 
on the day of a festival, when the inhabitants were too much occupied with 
dancing and other amusements to entertain any serious thoughts.
There are at the present moment about two thousand copies of the New 
Testament in Madrid.       It appears to the writer that it would be most 
expedient to distribute one-half of these books in La Mancha, commencing 
from the town of Oca        a, and concluding with Argamasilla at the other
end of the province; the remaining thousand might be devoted to the many 
villages on the road towards Arragon, especially to those of Alcarria where
the people are honest, mild and serious.       The writer would by no means
advise for the present an attempt to distribute the entire Bible amongst 
the peasantry, as he is of opinion that the New Testament is much better 
adapted to their understandings and circumstances.       If it be objected 
to the plan which he has presumed to suggest that it is impossible to 
convey to the rural districts of Spain the book of life without much 
difficulty and danger, he begs leave to observe that it does not become a 
real Christian to be daunted by either when it pleases his Maker to select 
him as an instrument; and that moreover if it be not written that a man is 
to perish by wild beast or reptiles, he is as safe in the den even of the 
cockatrice as in the most retired chamber of the king       s palace; and 
that if on the contrary he be doomed to perish by them, his destiny will 
overtake him notwithstanding all the precautions which he, like a blind 
worm, may essay for his security.
In conclusion the writer begs leave to remind the Committee that a 
society of liberal Spanish ecclesiastics is being formed for printing and 
circulating the Scripture without note or comment.       He does not advise
the entering into an intimate alliance and co-operation with this society, 
but he ventures to hope that if it continue to progress, there will be 
found Christian hearts in England to wish it success and Christian hands to
afford it some occasional assistance.       If the work of the Lord be 
done, it matters little whether Apollos or Paul be the labourers.

Seville, Jany. 12, 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I reached Cadiz in 
safety, after crossing the Bay of Biscay in rather boisterous 
weather.       I have been in Seville about a week, part of which time I 
have been rather indisposed with an old complaint; this night at ten 
o       clock I leave, with the letter-courier, for Madrid, whither I hope 
to arrive in something less than four days.       I should have started 
before now, had an opportunity presented itself.       I have been much 
occupied since coming here in writing to my friends in Spain apprising them
of my arrival, amongst others to Sir George Villiers.       I have of 
course visited the Sevillian bookseller, my correspondent here.       He 
informed me that seventy-six copies of the hundred Testaments entrusted to 
his care were placed in embargo by the Government last summer.       They 
are at present in the possession of the Ecclesiastical Governor.       I 
visited him also the other day, to make enquiries concerning our 
property.       He lives in a large house in the Pajaria, or 
straw-market.       He is a very old man, between seventy and eighty, and 
like almost all those who wear the sacerdotal habit in this city is a 
fierce persecuting Papist.       I believe he scarcely believed his ears 
when his two grand-nephews, beautiful black-haired boys, who were playing 
in the courtyard, ran to inform him that an Englishman was waiting to speak
with him, as it is probable that I was the first heretic who ever ventured 
into his habitation.       I found him in a vaulted room seated on a lofty 
chair, with two sinister-looking secretaries, also in sacerdotal habits, 
employed in writing at a table before him.       He brought powerfully to 
my recollection the grim old inquisitor who persuaded Philip the Second to 
slay his own son as an enemy to the Church.       He arose as I entered, 
and gazed upon me with a countenance dark with suspicion and 
dissatisfaction.       He at last condescended to point me to a sofa, and I
proceeded to state to him my business.       He became much agitated when I
mentioned the Testaments to him; but I no sooner spoke of the Bible Society
and told him who I was, than he could contain himself no longer, and with a
stammering tongue and with eyes flashing fire like hot coals, he proceeded 
to rail against the Society and myself, saying that the aims of the first 
were atrocious and that as to myself, he was surprised that being once 
lodged in the prison of Madrid I had ever been permitted to quit it; adding
that it was disgraceful in the Government to allow a person of my character
to roam about an innocent and peaceful country, corrupting the minds of the
ignorant and unsuspicious.       Far from allowing myself to be 
disconcerted by his rude behaviour, I replied to him with all possible 
politeness, and assured him that in this instance he had no reason to alarm
himself, as that my sole motive in claiming the books in question was to 
avail myself of an opportunity, which at present presented itself of 
sending them out of the country, which indeed I had been commanded to do by
an official notice.       But nothing would soothe him, and he informed me 
that he should not deliver up the books on any condition, save by a 
positive order of the Government.       As the matter was by no means an 
affair of consequence I thought it wise not to persist, and also prudent to
take my leave before he requested me.       I was followed even down into 
the street by his niece and grand-nephews, who during the whole of the 
conversation had listened at the door of the apartment and heard every 
word.
I have at present little more to say, having detailed everything worth 
mentioning which has occurred since [my] landing in the Peninsula for the 
third time.       As soon as I reach Madrid I shall proceed to make 
preparations for a fresh expedition, but in what direction I have scarcely 
determined.       Please therefore to pray that I may be enlightened, and 
that the angel of the Lord may smooth my path before me.       Greet all my
friends in my name; I hope speedily to be able to write to each, and in the
meantime remain, Revd. and dear Sir, yours ever,
G. B.

(Endorsed: recd. Feb. 4, 1839)
Madrid, No. 16 Calle 
Santiago,
25 January, 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       My last letter was 
from Seville, in which I gave you an account of my proceedings in that 
place, at the same time stating that I was about to repair to Madrid with 
the courier.       After travelling four days and nights we arrived, 
without having experienced the slightest accident; though it is but just to
observe, and always with gratitude to the Almighty, that the next courier 
was stopped.
A singular accident befell me immediately after my arrival.       On 
entering the arch of the posada, called La Reyna, where I intended 
to put up, I found myself encircled in a person       s arms, and on 
turning round in amazement beheld my Greek servant Antonio; he was haggard 
and ill-dressed, and his eyes seemed starting from their sockets.       As 
soon as we were alone he informed me that since my departure he had 
undergone great misery and destitution, having during the whole period been
unable to obtain a master in need of his services, so that he was brought 
nearly to the verge of desperation; but that on the night immediately 
preceding my arrival he had a dream in which he saw me, mounted on a black 
horse, ride up to the gate of the posada, and that on that account 
he had been waiting there during the greatest part of the day.       I do 
not pretend to offer any opinion concerning this narrative, which is beyond
the reach of my philosophy, and shall content myself with observing that 
only two individuals in Madrid, one of them Lord Clarendon (late Sir George
Villiers), were aware of my arrival in Spain.       I was very glad to 
receive him again into my service, as notwithstanding his faults, and he 
has many, he has in many instances proved of no slight assistance to me in 
my wanderings and Biblical labours, as indeed I have informed you on 
previous occasions.
I was soon settled in my former lodgings, when one of my first cares was
to pay a visit to Lord Clarendon.       I need not dilate on the 
particulars of our interview; suffice it to say, that he received me with 
more than usual kindness, and assured me that I might invariably rely upon 
him, if I should ever chance to be in need of his assistance and 
protection.       I told him that it was not our intention to take any 
steps towards preventing the civil or ecclesiastical authorities of Toledo 
from destroying the Testaments seized at Oca        a; and he smiled when I
added that the only wish we ventured to express concerning the matter was 
that, in the event of these books, which contain the Word of God, being 
committed to the flames, the said authorities, civil or ecclesiastic, would
commit the act with all the publicity possible.
My preparations for taking the field are now nearly completed, and 
within forty hours I hope to commence operations.       My first attempt 
will be made in a large village [at] about a league       s distance; and 
if it please the Lord to permit me to succeed there, it is my intention to 
proceed to all those villages or hamlets in the vicinity of Madrid hitherto
not supplied.       I then wend towards the east, to a distance of about 
thirty leagues.       I have been very passionate in prayer during the last
two or three days; and I entertain some hope that the Lord has condescended
to answer me, as I appear to see my way with considerable clearness.       
It may, of course, prove a delusion, and the prospects which seem to 
present themselves may be mere palaces of clouds which a breath of wind is 
sufficient to tumble into ruin; therefore bearing this possibility in mind 
it behoves me to beg that I may be always enabled to bow meekly to the 
dispensations of the Almighty, whether they be of favour or severity.
Two days ago I received my largest and most useful horse from the Sagra 
of Toledo and likewise a note from Lopez; he is unable to come himself at 
present to assist me, but he sent a countryman who, he is of opinion, will 
be of equal utility, at least for a time.       I yesterday despatched him 
to the low parts of Madrid, or as they are styled, Los Barrios 
bajos; he succeeded in disposing of twelve Testaments, amongst the very
poor people, in a few hours.       My other horse is at Salamanca, in Old 
Castile; but he suffered so much during my late expeditions, that it will 
hardly answer my purpose to send for him.
In passing through La Mancha we stayed for four hours at Manzanares, a 
large village which I hope to visit again shortly.       I was standing in 
the market-place conversing with a curate, when a frightful ragged object 
presented itself; it was a girl about eighteen or nineteen, perfectly 
blind, a white film being spread over her huge staring eyes; her 
countenance was as yellow as that of a mulatto.       I thought at first 
that she was a Gypsy, and addressing myself to her, enquired in Gitano if 
she were of that race.       She understood me; but shaking her head 
replied, that she was something better than a Gitana, and could speak 
something better than that jargon of witches, whereupon she commenced 
asking me several questions in exceeding good Latin.       I was of course 
very much surprised, but summoning all my Latinity, I called her Manchegan 
prophetess, and expressing my admiration at her learning begged to be 
informed by what means she became possessed of it.       I must here 
observe that a crowd instantly gathered around us who, though they 
understood not one word of our discourse, at every sentence of the girl 
shouted applause, proud in possession of a prophetess who could answer the 
Englishman.       She informed me that she was born blind, and that a 
Jesuit priest had taken compassion on her when she was a child, and had 
taught her the        holy language,        in order that the attention and
hearts of Christians might be more easily turned towards her.       I soon 
discovered that he had taught her something more than Latin, for upon 
telling her that I was an Englishman, she said that she had always loved 
Britain which was once the nursery of saints and sages       for example, 
Bede and Alcuin, Colombus [sic] and Thomas of Canterbury; but she 
added, those times had gone by since the re-appearance of Semiramis 
(Elizabeth).       Her Latin was truly excellent; and when I, like a 
genuine Goth, spoke of Anglia and Terra Vandalica (Andalusia), she 
corrected me by saying that in her language those places were called 
Britannia, and Terra Betica.       When we had finished our discourse, a 
gathering was made for the prophetess, the very poorest contributing 
something.       What wonderful people are the Jesuits!       When shall we
hear of an English rector instructing a beggar girl in the language of 
Cicero?
Ever yours,

Madrid, 16 Calle 
Santiago,
15 Febry. 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       In my last 
communication I stated that I had got everything in readiness to commence 
operations in the neighbourhood of Madrid, and indeed since that period I 
have entered upon my labours in reality, though unforeseen circumstances 
produced an unavoidable delay of several days.       It is with feelings of
gratitude to the Almighty that I now state that considerable success has 
attended my feeble efforts in the good cause.       All the villages within
the distance of four leagues to the east of Madrid have been visited, and 
Testaments to the number of nearly two hundred have been disposed of.      
It will be here necessary for me to inform you that these villages, for the
most part, are very small; some of them consisting of not more than a dozen
houses, or I should rather say miserable cabins.       I left my servant 
Antonio to superintend matters in Madrid, and proceeded with Vitoriano, the
peasant from Villa Seca, in the direction which I have already 
mentioned.       We however soon parted company, and pursued different 
routes.       The first village at which I made an attempt was Cobenna, 
about three leagues from Madrid.       I was dressed in the fashion of the 
peasants of the neighbourhood of Segovia in Old Castile, namely, I had on 
my head a species of leather helmet, or montera, with a jacket and 
trowsers of the same material.       I had the appearance of a person 
between sixty and seventy years of age, and drove before me a 
burrico, with a sack of Testaments lying across its back.       On 
nearing the village I met a genteel-looking young woman leading a little 
boy by the hand.       As I was about to pass her with the customary 
salutation of        Vaya usted con Dios,        she stopped, and 
after looking at me for a moment she said;        Uncle (Tio), what 
is that you have on your burrico?       Is it soap?              I 
replied,        Yes; it is soap to wash souls clean.              She 
demanded what I meant; whereupon I told her that I carried cheap and godly 
books for sale.       On her requesting to see one, I produced a copy from 
my pocket, and handed it to her.       She instantly commenced reading it 
with a loud voice, and continued so for at least ten minutes, occasionally 
exclaiming,        Que lectura tan bonita, que lectura tan 
linda!              (       What beautiful, what charming 
reading!       )       At last, on my informing her that I was in a hurry 
and could not wait any longer, she said,        True, true,        and 
asked me the price of the book.       I told her        But three 
reals       ; whereupon she said that though what I asked was very 
little, it was more than she could afford to give, as there was little or 
no money in those parts.       I said I was sorry for it, but that I could 
not dispose of the book for less than I had demanded, and accordingly 
resuming it, wished her farewell and left her.       I had not, however, 
proceeded thirty yards, when the boy came running behind me, shouting out 
of breath:        Stop, uncle! the book, the book.              Upon 
overtaking me he delivered me the three reals in copper, and seizing
the Testament, ran back to her, who I suppose was his sister, flourishing 
the book over his head with great glee.
On arriving at the village I directed my steps to a house around the 
door of which I saw several persons gathered, chiefly women.       On my 
displaying my books their curiosity was instantly aroused, and every person
had speedily one in his hand, many reading aloud.       However, after 
waiting nearly an hour I had disposed of but one copy, all complaining 
bitterly of the distress of the times and the almost total want of money, 
though at the same time they acknowledged that the books were wonderfully 
cheap and appeared to be very good and Christian-like.       I was about to
gather up my merchandise and depart, when on a sudden the curate of the 
place made his appearance.       After having examined the books for some 
time with considerable attention, he asked me the price of a copy, and upon
my informing him that it was three reals, he replied that the 
binding was worth more, and that he was much afraid that I had stolen the 
books, and that it was perhaps his duty to send me to prison as a 
suspicious character.       He added however that the books were good 
books, however they might be obtained, and concluded by purchasing and 
paying for two copies.       The poor people no sooner heard their curate 
recommend the volumes, than all were eager to secure one, and hurried here 
and there for the purpose of procuring money, so that between twenty and 
thirty copies were sold almost in an instant.       This adventure not only
affords an instance of the power still possessed by the Spanish clergy over
the minds of the people, but likewise that such influence is not always 
exerted in a manner favourable to the maintenance of ignorance and 
superstition.
In another village on my showing a Testament to a woman, she said that 
she had a child at school for whom she should like to purchase one, but 
that she must first know whether the book was calculated to be of service 
to him.       She then went away, and presently returned with the 
schoolmaster, followed by all the children under his care.       She then, 
showing the schoolmaster a book, enquired if it would answer for her 
son.       The schoolmaster called her a simpleton for asking such a 
question, and said that he knew the book well, and there was not its equal 
in the world.       (No hay otro en el mundo.)       He instantly 
purchased five copies for his pupils, regretting that he had no more money,
       For in that case,        said he,        I would buy the whole 
cargo.              Upon hearing this, the woman purchased four copies: 
namely, one for her son, another for her husband who was dead, a third for 
herself, and a fourth for her brother, whom, she said, she was expecting 
home that night from Madrid.
In this manner we proceeded, not however with uniform success.       In 
some villages the people were so poor and needy that they had literally no 
money; even in these, however, we managed to dispose of a few copies in 
exchange for barley or refreshments.       (Is this right?)
On entering one very small hamlet, Vitoriano was stopped by the curate, 
who on learning what he carried told him that unless he instantly departed,
he would cause him to be imprisoned, and write to Madrid in order to give 
information of what was going on.       The excursion lasted about eight 
days.       Immediately after my return, I despatched Vitoriano to 
Caramanchel, a village at the distance of half a league from Madrid, the 
only one towards the west which had not been visited last year.       He 
stayed there about an hour and disposed of twelve copies, and then 
returned, as he is exceedingly timid and was afraid of being met by the 
thieves who swarm on that road in the evening.       In a few days I depart
for Guadalajara and the villages of Alcarria.

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Mar. 15, 1839)
Naval Carnero, New 
Castile,
March 4, 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have to 
acknowledge the receipt of your kind letter of the 6th ult., which I hope 
to be able to answer in all points on another occasion.       I am now in a
small town on the road to Talavera, to which place it is possible that I 
may proceed.       I take up the pen in order to give you a brief account 
of what has taken place since I last wrote.       I have that to 
communicate which I am confident will cause yourself and the remainder of 
my dear friends in Earl Street to smile; while at the same time it will not
fail to prove interesting, as affording an example of the feeling prevalent
in some of the lone and solitary villages of Spain with respect to 
innovation and all that savours thereof, and the strange acts which are 
sometimes committed by the rural authorities and the priests, without the 
slightest fear of being called to account; for as they live quite apart  a 
name="citation392">[392] 
from the rest of the world, they know no people greater than themselves, 
and scarcely dream of a higher power than their own.       In my latest 
communication I stated that I was about to make an excursion to Gaudalajara
and the villages of Alcarria; indeed I merely awaited the return of 
Vitoriano to sally forth: I having despatched him in that direction with a 
few Testaments as a kind of explorer, in order that from his report as to 
the disposition manifested by the people for purchasing, I might form a 
tolerably accurate opinion as to the number of copies which it might be 
necessary to carry with me.       However I heard nothing of him for a 
fortnight, at the end of which period a letter was brought to me by a 
peasant, dated from the prison of Fuente La Higuera, a village eight 
leagues from Madrid, in the campi        a, or champaign of 
Alcal        .       This letter, written by Vitoriano, gave me to 
understand, that he had been already eight days imprisoned, and that unless
I could find some means to extricate him there was every probability of his
remaining in durance until he should perish with hunger, which he had no 
doubt would occur as soon as his money was exhausted and he was unable to 
purchase the necessaries of life at a great price.       From what I 
afterwards learned it appeared that after passing the town of Alcal        
he had commenced distributing, and with considerable success.       His 
entire stock consisted of sixty-one Testaments, twenty-five of which he 
sold without the least difficulty or interruption in the single village of 
Arganza, the poor labourers showering blessings on his head for providing 
them with such good books at an easy price.       Not more than eighteen 
remained when he turned off the high road towards Fuente La Higuera.       
This place was already tolerably well known to him, he having visited it of
old when he travelled the country in the capacity of a vendor of 
cacharros or earthen pans.       He subsequently stated that he felt
some misgiving whilst on the way, as the village had invariably enjoyed a 
bad reputation.       On his arrival, after having put up his 
caball        jo, or little pony, at a posada, he proceeded 
to the Alcalde for the purpose of demanding permission to sell 
books, which that dignitary immediately granted.       He now entered a 
house and sold a copy, and likewise in a second.       Emboldened by 
success he entered a third, which it appeared belonged to the 
barber-surgeon of the village.       This personage, having just completed 
his dinner, was seated in an arm-chair within his doorway when Vitoriano 
made his appearance.       He was a man of about thirty-five, of a savage, 
truculent countenance.       On Vitoriano       s offering him a Testament 
he took it into his hand to examine it; but no sooner did his eyes glance 
over the title-page than he burst into a loud laugh, exclaiming:        Ha,
ha, Don Jorge Borrow, the English heretic, we have encountered you at 
last.       Glory to the Virgin and the Saints!       We have long been 
expecting you here, and at length you have arrived.              He then 
enquired the price of the book, and on being told three reals, he 
flung down two, and rushed out of the house with the Testament in his 
hand.       Vitoriano now became alarmed, and determined upon leaving the 
place as soon as possible.       He therefore hurried back to the 
posada, and having paid for the barley which his pony had consumed, 
went into the stable, and placing the pack-saddle on the animal       s 
back was about to lead it forth when the Alcalde of the village, the
surgeon, and twelve other men, some of whom were armed with muskets, 
suddenly presented themselves.       They instantly made Vitoriano 
prisoner, and, after seizing the books and laying an embargo on the pony, 
proceeded amidst much abuse to drag their captive to what they denominated 
their prison, a low damp apartment with a little grated window, where they 
locked him up and left him.       At the expiration of three quarters of an
hour they again appeared, and conducted him to the house of the curate, 
where they sat down in conclave, the curate who was a man stone-blind being
president, whilst the sacristan officiated as secretary.       The surgeon 
having stated his accusation against the prisoner, namely, that he had 
detected him in the fact of selling a version of the Scriptures in the 
vulgar tongue, the curate proceeded to examine Vitoriano, asking him his 
name and place of residence       to which he replied that his name was 
Vitoriano Lopez, and that he was a native of Villa Seca in the Sagra of 
Toledo.       The curate then demanded what religion he professed, and 
whether he was a Mahometan or freemason, and received for answer that he 
was a Roman Catholic.       I must here state that Vitoriano, though 
sufficiently shrewd in his way, is a poor old labourer of sixty-four, and 
until that moment had never heard of Mahometans or freemasons.       The 
curate becoming now incensed, called him a tunante or scoundrel, and
added,        You have sold your soul to a heretic; we have long been aware
of your proceedings, and those of your master.       You are the same 
Lopez, whom he last year rescued from the prison of Villallos, in the 
province of Avila.       I sincerely hope that he will attempt to do the 
same thing here.                     Yes, yes,        shouted the rest of 
the conclave,        let him but venture here, and we will shed his 
heart       s blood on our stones.              In this manner they went on
for nearly half-an-hour; at last they broke up the meeting and conducted 
Vitoriano once more to his prison.
During his confinement he lived tolerably well, being in possession of 
money; his meals were sent him twice a day from the posada, where 
his pony remained in embargo.       Once or twice he asked permission of 
the Alcalde, who visited him every night and morning with his armed 
guard, to purchase pen and paper, in order that he might write to Madrid; 
but this favour was peremptorily refused him, and all the inhabitants of 
the village were forbidden under terrible penalties to afford him the means
of writing, or to convey any message from him beyond the precincts of the 
place, and two boys were stationed before the window of his cell for the 
purpose of watching everything which might be conveyed to him.       It 
happened one day that Vitoriano, being in need of a pillow for his head, 
sent word to the people of the posada to send him his 
alforjas or saddle-bags, which they did.       In these bags there 
chanced to be a kind of rope or, as it is called in Spanish, soga, 
with which he was in the habit of fastening his satchel to the pony       s
back.       The urchins seeing an end of this rope hanging from the 
alforjas instantly ran to the Alcalde to give him 
information.       Late at evening the Alcalde again visited the 
prisoner, at the head of his twelve men as usual.              Buenas 
noches,        said the Alcalde.              Buenas noches 
tenga usted,        replied Vitoriano.              For what purpose 
did you send for the soga this afternoon?        demanded the 
functionary.              I sent for no soga,        said the 
prisoner,        I sent for my alforjas to serve as a pillow, and it
was sent in them by chance.                     Thou art a false malicious 
knave,        retorted the Alcalde,        you intend to hang 
yourself, and by so doing ruin us all, as your death would be laid to our 
door.       Give me the soga.              No greater insult can be 
offered to a Spaniard, than to tax him with an intention of committing 
suicide.       Poor Vitoriano flew into a violent rage, and after calling 
the Alcalde several uncivil names, he pulled the soga from 
his bags, and flinging it at his head, told him to take it home and use it 
for his own neck.
At length the people of the posada took pity on the prisoner, 
perceiving that he was very harshly treated for no crime at all.       They
therefore determined to afford him an opportunity of informing his friends 
of his situation, and accordingly sent him a pen and inkhorn, concealed in 
a loaf of bread, and a piece of writing-paper, pretending that the latter 
was intended for cigars.       So Vitoriano wrote the letter; but now 
ensued the difficulty of sending it to its destination, as no person in the
village dare have carried it for any reward.       The good people, 
however, persuaded a disbanded soldier from another village, who chanced to
be at Fuente La Higuera in quest of work, to charge himself with it, 
promising that I would pay him well for his trouble.       The man, 
watching his opportunity, received the letter from Vitoriano at the window;
and it was he who, after travelling on foot all night, delivered it to me 
in safety at Madrid.
I was now relieved from my anxiety, and had no fears for the 
result.       I instantly went to a friend who is in possession of large 
estates about Guadalajara, in which province Fuente La Higuera is situated,
who furnished me with letters to the Civil Governor of Guadalajara and all 
the principal authorities, and at Antonio       s request, I despatched him
upon the errand of the prisoner       s liberation.       He first directed
his course to Fuente La Higuera, where entering the Alcalde       s 
house he boldly told him what he had come about.       The Alcalde, 
expecting that I was at hand with an army of Englishmen for the purpose of 
rescuing the prisoner, became greatly alarmed, and instantly despatched his
wife to summon his twelve men.       However, on Antonio       s assuring 
him that there was no intention of having recourse to violence, he became 
more tranquil.       In a little time Antonio was summoned before the 
conclave and its blind sacerdotal president.       They at first attempted 
to frighten him, by assuming a loud bullying tone and talking of the 
necessity of killing all strangers, and especially the detested Don Jorge 
and his dependents.       Antonio, however, who is not a person apt to 
allow himself to be easily terrified, scoffed at their threats, and showing
them his letters to the authorities of Guadalajara said that he should 
proceed there on the morrow and denounce their lawless conduct; adding that
he was a Turkish subject, and that should they dare to offer him the 
slightest incivility he would write to the Sublime Porte, in comparison 
with whom the best kings in the world were but worms, and who would not 
fail to avenge the wrongs of any of his children, however distant, in a 
manner too terrible to be mentioned.       He then returned to his 
posada.       The conclave now proceeded to deliberate among 
themselves, and at last determined to despatch their prisoner on the morrow
to Guadalajara, and deliver him into the hands of the Civil Governor.
Nevertheless, in order to keep up a semblance of authority, they that 
night placed two men armed at the door of the posada where Antonio 
was lodged, as if he himself were a prisoner; these men as often as the 
clock struck the hours, shouted,        Ave Maria!       Death to 
the heretics!              Early in the morning the Alcalde 
presented himself at the posada, but before entering he made an 
oration at the door to the people in the street saying amongst other 
things:        Brethren, these are the fellows who have come to rob us of 
our religion.              He then went into Antonio       s apartment, and
after saluting him with great politeness said that as a royal or high mass 
was about to be celebrated that morning, he had come to invite him to go to
church with him; whereupon Antonio, though by no means a mass-goer, rose 
and accompanied him, and remained two hours, as he told me, on his knees on
the cold stones to his great discomfort, the eyes of the whole congregation
being fixed upon him during the time.
After mass and breakfast, he departed for Guadalajara, Vitoriano having 
been already despatched there under a guard.       On his arrival he 
presented his letters to the individuals for whom they were intended.      
The Civil Governor was convulsed with merriment on hearing Antonio       s 
account of the adventure.       Vitoriano was set at liberty and the books 
were placed in embargo at Guadalajara: the Governor stating, however, that 
though it was his duty to detain them at present, they should be sent to me
whenever I chose to claim them.       He moreover said that he would do his
best to cause the authorities of Fuente La Higuera to be severely punished,
as in the whole affair they had acted in a most cruel, tyrannical manner, 
for which they had no authority.       Thus terminated this affair, one of 
those little accidents which chequer missionary life in Spain.
Vitoriano is now with me at Naval Carnero, as he begged me almost on his
knees to be permitted to attend me and to be employed as before.       At 
his imprisonment he smiles.       Antonio and myself have lately been very 
successful at Madrid, having sold considerably upwards of a hundred 
Testaments and several Bibles.       It is with deep gratitude I state that
the poor of Madrid receive the Scripture with gladness: to the rich I offer
it not, their hearts are hard.       I am writing a journal of the present 
expedition.

(Endorsed: recd. March 21, 1839)
Madrid, March 9, 1839.
On the other side I send you my account, which I hope you will find 
correct.       In order to prevent confusion, I have charged my expenses 
from the period of my leaving London until my arrival at Cadiz in the 
Spanish, instead of the English currency.       Respecting the item of 
Vitoriano, it will be as well to observe that, when employed in journeying,
I allow him six reals per diem and his diet, and two when in 
Madrid.       I do not know that there is anything else to which I need 
direct your attention, except that I have not noted my quarter       s 
salary because ignorant of the rate of exchange.       If you please, you 
can credit me to the amount.
I did not go further than Naval Carnero on the way to Talavera, on 
account of an accident which occurred, the clergy having raised the country
against me.       Glory to God, they are becoming thoroughly alarmed, and 
with much reason.       I have disposed of all the Bibles bound already, 
and have been compelled on account of the demand to order the rest of the 
sheets to be got in readiness.       We shall be compelled to evacuate our 
storehouse and to seek another, as the rats are doing prodigious havoc to 
the stores.
Pray, remember me to all friends, and believe me, etc.,

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Apr. 8, 1839)
20 March 1839,
Madrid, Calle 
Santiago.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Having much to 
communicate, and of no slight importance, I shall offer no apology for now 
addressing you.       My last letter was from Naval Carnero, in which I 
informed you of various circumstances, connected with the distribution of 
the blessed Gospel, which had recently occurred.       I likewise stated 
that it was very probable that I should proceed to Talavera, for the 
purpose of seeing what might be done in that neighbourhood.       The day, 
however, subsequent to dispatching my letter ushered in events which 
compelled me to alter my resolution; twenty Testaments were seized in a 
village in the neighbourhood of Naval Carnero, and I learned that our 
proceedings, on the other side of Madrid, had caused alarm amongst the 
heads of the clergy, who made a formal complaint to the 
Government       who immediately sent orders to all the Alcaldes of 
the villages, great and small, in New Castile to seize the New Testament 
wherever it might be exposed for sale, but at the same time to be 
particularly careful not to detain or maltreat the person or persons who 
might be attempting to vend it.       An exact description of myself 
accompanied these orders, and the authorities, both civil and military, 
were exhorted to be on their guard against me, and my arts and 
machinations; for, as the document stated, I was to-day in one place and 
to-morrow at twenty leagues distance.       On receiving this intelligence,
I instantly resolved to change for a time my strategic system, and not to 
persist in a course which would expose the sacred volume to seizure at 
every step which I might take to circulate it.       I therefore galloped 
back to Madrid, leaving Vitoriano to follow.       It will be as well to 
observe here, that we sold twenty and odd Testaments in villages adjacent 
to Naval Carnero, before the orders had arrived.
Arrived at Madrid, I lost not a moment in putting into execution the 
plan which I had formed.       Having an extensive acquaintance amongst the
lower orders, I instantly selected eight of the most intelligent to 
co-operate with me, amongst whom were five women.       All these I 
supplied with Testaments, and then sent them forth to all the parishes in 
Madrid.       I will at once state the result which, I confess, has more 
than answered my expectations.       Since my return from Naval Carnero 
nearly six hundred copies of the life and words of Him of Nazareth have 
been sold in the streets and alleys of Madrid, a fact which I hope I may be
permitted to mention with gladness and with decent triumph in the 
Lord.       There is a place in Madrid called the Puerta del Sol, which is 
a central spot, surrounded with shops, into which the four principal 
streets disembogue, if I may be allowed the expression.       These streets
are the Calle Alcal        , the Calle Montera, the Calle May        r, and
that of Carr        ta.       The wealthiest of all these is the Calle 
Montera, where reside the principal merchants and shop-keepers of Madrid; 
it is in fact the street of commerce, and is in many respects similar to 
the Zacat        n of Granada.       Every house in this street is supplied
with its Testament, and the same may be said with respect to the Puerta del
Sol; nay, in some instances every individual in the house, man and child, 
man-servant and maid-servant, is furnished with a copy, which we have 
invariably sold, and never given.       My Greek Antonio has made wonderful
exertions in this quarter, and it is but justice to say that but for his 
instrumentality, on many occasions, I might be by no means able to give so 
favourable an account of the spread of the Bible in Spain, as I now 
conscientiously can.       There was a time when, as you are well aware, I 
was in the habit of saying,        Dark Madrid,        an expression which 
I thank God I may now drop; for can that city justly be called 
       dark        in which thirteen hundred Testaments, at least, are in 
circulation and in daily use?
It appears to me that a glorious reform is commencing in Spain; indeed 
matters have lately come to my knowledge, which had they been prophesied 
only a year ago by the Spirit of truth itself, I should have experienced 
much difficulty in believing.       You will be surprised when I tell you 
that in two churches of Madrid, the New Testament is regularly expounded 
every Sunday evening, by the respective curates, to about twenty children 
who attend, and who are provided with copies of the Society       s edition
of Madrid, 1837.       The churches which I allude to are those of San 
Gines and Santa Cruz.       Now I humbly conceive that this fact alone is 
more than equivalent to all the expense which the Society has incurred, in 
the efforts which it has hitherto made to introduce the Gospel into Spain; 
but be this as it may, I am certain, if I may judge by my own feelings, 
that it has amply recompensed me for all the anxiety and unhappiness which 
I underwent last year.       Whenever I am now called upon to discontinue 
my labours in the Peninsula, I shall comply without the slightest murmur or
remonstrance, my heart being filled with gratitude to the Lord for having 
been permitted, useless vessel as I am, to see at least some of the seed 
springing up which during two years I have been casting on the stony ground
of the interior of Spain.
There is at present a great demand for Bibles; since the time of writing
last we have sold upwards of one hundred copies.       Indeed the demand is
far greater than I can answer, as the books are disposed of faster than 
they can be bound by the man whom I employ for that purpose, and in whose 
secrecy and honour I have perfect confidence.       Eight-and-twenty copies
are at present bespoken and paid for.       Many of these Bibles have found
their way into the best houses in Madrid.       The Marquis of Santa Coloma
has a large family, but every individual of it, old or young, is now in 
possession of a Bible and likewise of a Testament, which, strange to say, 
were recommended by the chaplain of the house.       One of my most zealous
agents in the propagation of the Bible is an ecclesiastic.       He never 
walks out without carrying one beneath his gown, which he offers to the 
first person he meets whom he thinks likely to purchase.       Another 
excellent assistant is an elderly gentleman of Navarre, enormously rich, 
who is continually purchasing copies on his own account, which he, as I am 
told, sends into his native province, for distribution amongst his friends 
and the poor.
I have at present sold as many Testaments as I think Madrid will bear, 
for a time.       I have therefore called in the greatest part of my 
people, and content myself with the sale of twelve or fourteen a week, for 
I am afraid to over-stock the market, and to bring the book into contempt 
by making it too common.       The greatest part of those which still 
remain (about one thousand) I reserve for Seville, Granada, and some of the
other inland cities of Andalusia, specially Jaen, the bishop of which is 
very favourable to us and our cause.       I have likewise my eye on Ceuta,
its garrison, its convicts, and singular inhabitants, half Spaniards, half 
Moors.       To Andalusia I shall probably proceed in about three 
weeks.
I beg leave to call your attention to the work I sent you, and the 
ferocious attack which it contains against the Bible Society, and 
especially to the letter of the curate, which I sincerely wish you would 
insert in your Extracts.       This publication was established and is 
supported by money sent by the Cardinals of Rome, and is principally 
directed against us.       Its abuse, however, is our praise; and the world
may form some judgment of what we are accomplishing in Spain by attending 
to some of the remarks and observations which appear in this work, and 
which are in all points worthy of Rome and its clan.
My respects to Mr. Josiah Forster, who I hope will have received the 
biography of Rip        ll, the Quaker, executed at Valencia in 1826.

Revd. and dear Sir,       In a few days I 
shall leave Madrid for Seville; and being anxious to write a few lines 
before my departure in order that yourself and others friends may be 
acquainted with the exact state of affairs in Spain, I embrace the present 
opportunity.       In the first place however I beg leave to apologise for 
not having ere this performed my promise of writing.       Many causes 
unnecessary to recapitulate prevented me; but I steadfastly hope that 
already with your usual considerate goodness you have imputed my tardiness 
to anything but neglect.
A convoy starts for Andalusia on the 13th, and I intend to avail myself 
of it so far as to send therewith my servant Antonio with the horses and 
the Testaments which I destine for circulation in that province.       I 
shall myself follow with the courier.       True it is that I had 
determined to proceed by Estremadura, but circumstances have occurred which
have induced me to alter my resolution.       The roads in Spain are in a 
worse state than ever; and in Estremadura particularly, which for some time
past has enjoyed a tolerable state of tranquillity, a band of Carlist 
robbers have lately made their appearance, who murder, make prisoner, or 
put at ransom every person who has the misfortune to fall into their 
hands.       I therefore deem it wise to avoid, if possible, the 
alternative of being shot or having to pay one thousand pounds for being 
set at liberty, which has already befallen several individuals.       It is
moreover wicked to tempt Providence systematically.       I have already 
thrust myself into more danger than was perhaps strictly necessary, and as 
I have been permitted hitherto to escape, it is better to be content with 
what it has pleased the Lord to do for me up to the present moment, than to
run the risk of offending Him by a blind confidence in His forbearance, 
which may be over-taxed.       As it is, however, at all times best to be 
frank, I am willing to confess that I am what the world calls exceedingly 
superstitious; perhaps the real cause of my change of resolution was a 
dream, in which I imagined myself on a desolate road in the hands of 
several robbers, who were hacking me with their long ugly knives.

We have been very successful of late, having, since my last letter to 
Mr. Brandram, sold no less than two hundred Bibles, so that not more than 
one hundred and fifty remain of the five hundred which were sent to me from
Barcelona in sheets.       I have discontinued selling Testaments in 
Madrid, as it appears to me that we shall have barely sufficient, unless 
something unforeseen occurs, for Andalusia and one or two other points 
which I wish to visit.       When I recollect the difficulties which have 
encompassed our path, I can sometimes hardly credit all that the Almighty 
has permitted us to accomplish within the last year: a large edition of the
New Testament almost entirely disposed of in the very centre of old, 
gloomy, fanatic Spain, in spite of the opposition and the furious cry of 
the sanguinary priesthood and the edicts of a tyrannical, deceitful 
Government; moreover a spirit of religious enquiry excited, which I have 
fervent hope will sooner or later lead to blessed and most important 
results.       Till of late the name most abhorred and dreaded in these 
parts of Spain was that of Martin Luther, who was in general considered as 
a species of demon, a cousin-german to Belial and Beelzebub, who under the 
disguise of a man wrote and preached blasphemy against the Highest.       
Yet now, strange to say, this once abominated personage is spoken of with 
no slight degree of respect.       People, with Bibles in their hands, not 
unfrequently visit me, enquiring with much earnestness and with no slight 
degree of simplicity for the writings of the great Doctor Martin, whom 
indeed some suppose to be still alive.       It will be as well here to 
observe that of all the names connected with the Reformation, that of 
Luther is the only one known in Spain, and let me add that no controversial
writings but his are likely to be esteemed as possessing the slightest 
weight or authority, however great their intrinsic merit may be.       The 
printing, therefore, of tracts in the Spanish language, of the description 
hitherto adopted, appears to be pregnant with no good or benefit 
whatever.       Of what might be the result of well-executed translations 
of judicious selections from the works of Luther, it is not my business to 
offer an opinion.
Before commencing this journey to Andalusia I must take the liberty of 
making one humble request to my friends of the Bible Society, which is to 
be patient.       It may not be in my power to send them for a long time 
any flattering accounts of operations commenced there.       I shall be 
surrounded with enemies, bitter, malignant, and powerful, against whose 
efforts it is very possible that I may not be able to stand my ground; or 
the books which I carry with me may be seized and sequestrated, in spite of
all the plans which I have devised for their safety.       The great 
failing of Protestants, in general, is a tendency to spring suddenly to the
pinnacle of exultation, and as suddenly to fall to the lowest bathos of 
dejection, forgetting that the brightest day as well as the most gloomy 
night must necessarily have a termination.       How far more wise are the 
members of that object of my undying detestation, the Church of Rome; from 
mixing with whom I have acquired one principal point of wisdom, which may 
be termed, Ever to expect evil, and ever to hope for good; by
attending to which maxim we find that Church ever regaining the ground 
which it has lost.       Yesterday seeming a lifeless stick, as in the case
of England, to-day it is a magnificent tree, glorious with leaves and 
fruit.       Excuse these observations which, I assure you, are well 
meant.       No one acquainted with me will lay undue partiality to the 
Roman Church to my charge, yet there are some points about it which I 
highly admire; and you know well enough that it is lawful to receive 
instruction from an enemy.
I have been lately going through Morrison       s Chinese Matthew.      
I confess that I am the merest tyro in the language, nevertheless I am 
compelled to state that upon the whole I do not like the translation.      
It appears to me that in various instances the characters are not 
grammatically placed; I mean, not as they are placed in the writings if the
best Chinese authors to express the same ideas.       Moreover he has 
translated the sacred Name by the character which the Chinese are in the 
habit of bestowing on the spirits whose idols they worship, and which is by
no means applicable to the one great God, whom the missionaries of the 
Greek and Roman Churches for want of an equivalent in Chinese have always 
styled, and with justice [three Chinese characters] (tien tsz 
hwang), or King of Heaven.       The Holy Ghost, he renders by 
tching fung, or Holy Wind, which is a Hebraism, and which can 
scarcely be understood by the Chinese.       In Lipoftsoff       s Mandchou
version it is happily translated by the Holy Spirit.       You will 
recollect that on my second return to Spain you requested me to look into 
Morrison       s Testament, on which account I shall offer no excuse for 
these trifling remarks.
Do me the favour, my dear Sir, to inform Mr. Hitchin that within a day 
or two I shall send him another account of money received and 
disbursed.       I hope you forwarded the packet containing the life of 
Rip        ll to Mr. Forster.       Having now said my say for the present,
I have the honour to remain, Revd. and dear Sir,
Your most obedient humble servant,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram.
(Endorsed: recd. May 21, 1839)
Seville, Spain, 
May 2, 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have been in 
Seville one week.       Perhaps on learning this you will be disposed to 
demand the reason of my not having written previously to this, knowing, as 
I do, the anxiety of my friends to know the fate of their adventurer in his
wanderings in wild Spain; but believe me that I had several reasons for 
deferring, the principal being an unconquerable aversion to writing blank 
letters.       At present I have something to communicate besides my 
arrival, indeed one or two odd things.       The courier and myself came 
all the way without the slightest accident, my usual wonderful good fortune
accompanying us. I may well call it wonderful.       I was not aware when I
resolved to venture with the mail that I was running into the den of the 
lion, the whole of La Mancha with the exception of a few fortified places 
being once more in the hands of Pollillos and his banditti, who whenever it
pleases them, stop the courier, burn the vehicle and letters, murder the 
paltry escort which attends, and carry away any chance passenger to the 
mountains, where an enormous ransom is demanded, which if not paid, brings 
on the dilemma of four shots through the head, as the Spaniards say.       
The upper part of Andalusia is becoming rapidly nearly as bad as La 
Mancha.       The last time the courier had passed, he was attacked at the 
defile of La Rumblar by six mounted robbers; he was guarded by an escort of
as many soldiers; but the former suddenly galloped from behind a solitary 
venta and dashed the soldiers to the ground, who were taken quite by
surprise, the hoofs of the robbers        horses making no noise on account
of the great quantity of mud.       The soldiers were instantly disarmed 
and bound to olive-trees, with the exception of two who escaped amongst the
rocks; they were then mocked and tormented by the robbers, or rather 
fiends, for nearly half an hour, when they were shot, the head of the 
corporal who commanded being blown to fragments with a blunderbuss.       
The robbers then burnt the coach, which they accomplished by igniting the 
letters by means of the tow with which they light their cigars.       The 
life of the courier was saved by one of them who had formerly been his 
postillion; he was, however, robbed and stripped.       As we passed by the
scene of the butchery the poor fellow burst into tears, and, though a 
Spaniard, cursed Spain and the Spaniards, saying that he shortly intended 
to pass over to Morocco to confess Mahomet and to learn the Law of the 
Moors, for that any country and religion was better than his own.       He 
pointed to the tree where the corporal had been tied; though much rain had 
fallen since, the ground around was still saturated with blood, and a dog 
was gnawing a piece of the unfortunate wretch       s skull.       A friar 
travelled with us the whole way from Madrid to Seville; he was of the 
Missionaries, and was going to the Philippine Islands to conquer 
(para conquistar), for such was his word, by which I suppose he 
meant preaching to the Indians.       During the whole journey he exhibited
every symptom of the most abject fear, which operated upon him so that he 
became deadly sick, so that we were obliged to stop twice in the road and 
lay him amongst the green corn.       He said that if he fell into the 
hands of the factious he was a lost priest, for that they would first make 
him say mass and then blow him up with gunpowder.       He had been a 
professor of philosophy, as he told me, in one of the convents (I think it 
was San Tom        s) of Madrid, before their suppression, but appeared to 
be grossly ignorant of the Scripture, which he confounded with the works of
Virgil.
We stopped at Manzanares as usual; it was Sunday morning and the market 
was crowded with people.       I was recognised in a moment, and twenty 
pairs of legs instantly hurried away in quest of the prophetess, who 
presently made her appearance in the house to which we had retired to 
breakfast.       After many greetings on both sides, she proceeded in her 
admirable Latin to give me an account of all that had occurred in the 
village since I had last been there, and of the atrocities of the factious 
in the neighbourhood.       I asked her to breakfast and introduced her to 
the friar whom she addressed in this manner; Anne Domine Reverendissime 
facis adhuc sacrificium?       But the friar did not understand her, 
and waxing angry anathematized her for a witch and bade her begone.       
She was however not to be disconcerted, and commenced singing in 
extemporary Castilian verse the praises of friars and religious houses in 
general.       On departing I gave her a peseta, upon which she 
burst into tears and entreated that I would write to her if I reached 
Seville in safety.
We did arrive at Seville in safety, and I took leave of the friar 
telling him that I hoped to meet him again at Philippi.       I must now be
brief.       In a few days Antonio arrived with the horses.       
Difficulties now began to show themselves.       All the Testaments were 
stopped at the custom house, they were contained in two large chests: but I
now know Spain and the Spaniards.       For a few dollars I procured a 
fiador or person who engaged that the chests should be 
carried down the river and embarked at San Lucar for a foreign land.       
Yesterday I hired a boat and sent them down, but on the way I landed in a 
secure place all the Testaments which I intend for this part of the 
country.       The chests therefore, with the copies required for Tangiers 
and England, with the hundred Gospels in Gitano and Basque for the Library 
of the Bible Society, are at present at San Lucar in the custom house, from
which I expect to receive to-morrow the receipt which the authorities here 
demand, and which will be necessary for the security of my voucher.       
Indeed the whole affair, though attended with considerable trouble and 
expense to me, was a mere formality, as I was given to understand.       I 
was myself treated with the greatest politeness, and was told that my 
intentions were known and honoured.       Late last night Antonio and 
myself returned from an excursion on foot, bringing beneath our cloaks, as 
if they were smuggled goods, a considerable number of Testaments; our path 
lay along the banks of the Guadalquivir, the rain poured and the river 
roared, and by the time we reached Seville we were wet through and covered 
with mud from head to foot.       To-day I am laid up, being so 
stiff and sore that I can hardly move; but anything for the 
Gospel       s sake.
It is my opinion, and I am not one of those who hazard an opinion 
rashly, that much may be accomplished in this place, which, though by no 
means the most populous and wealthy, is the most interesting town in all 
Spain, and stands beneath the most glorious heaven, and amidst the most 
delightful environs; but to effect anything, patience must be exhibited and
prudence employed, and much of both.       Consider my situation 
here.       I am in a city by nature very Levitical, as it contains within 
it the most magnificent and splendidly endowed cathedral of any in 
Spain.       I am surrounded by priests and friars, who know and hate me, 
and who, if I commit the slightest act of indiscretion, will halloo their 
myrmidons against me.       The press is closed to me, the libraries are 
barred against me, I have no one to assist me but my hired servant, no 
pious English families to comfort or encourage me, the British subjects 
here being ranker papists and a hundred times more bigoted than the Spanish
themselves, the consul a renegade Quaker.       Yet notwithstanding,
with God       s assistance I will do much, though silently, burrowing like
the mole in darkness beneath the ground.       Those who have triumphed in 
Madrid, and in the two Castiles where the difficulties were seven times 
greater, are not to be dismayed by priestly frowns at Seville.       All I 
dread is the imprudence of very excellent people, whose aim is good, but 
who are doing exactly what is calculated to further the views of the 
enemy.       I wish they could be brought to see the absolute necessity of 
changing their system.       I suppose you heard of the affair of 
Cadiz.
I have of late written several letters home, which I wish may have been 
received as they contain information which I think will be considered of 
importance; nevertheless as the road to France has for some time past been 
in the hands of the Carlists, it is very possible that they may have 
miscarried.       I shall therefore take the liberty of telling you that 
about a thousand Testaments have been sold, and all the Bibles, to the 
amount of 463, since my return to the Peninsula.       I shall be happy to 
receive a letter from you as soon as possible: you can direct either to my 
lodgings at Madrid, or to Posada de la Reyna, Calle Gimios, Sevilla.
Pray excuse this letter, it is badly written, with a bad pen and with 
bad ink.       I am moreover sick and in pain.       Present my respects to
Mr. Jowett, Mr. Browne, and all friends, not forgetting Dr. Steinkopff, to 
whom I shortly hope to write.

To the Rev. G. Browne
(Endorsed: recd. July 1, 1839)
Seville, Plazuela de la Pila
Seca, No. 7,
June 12, 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I received in due 
course of time your exceedingly kind letter of the 16th April, and am very 
grateful for the various intelligence which you were pleased to 
communicate.       I should have replied ere this; but I am one of those, 
as I believe you are aware, who are averse to writing, especially from a 
considerable distance, unless they possess matter of sufficient consequence
to fill creditably the pages of an epistle.       I could wish that at the 
present moment I had more to write upon, and more interesting details to 
send you than these which follow.       For two or three weeks after my 
arrival at Seville I was unable to accomplish anything, on account of the 
seizure of the books, with which you are doubtless acquainted.       I 
however by the assistance of the Almighty, for which I prayed, was enabled,
though not without considerable trouble, to overcome that difficulty, and 
to obtain all the Testaments of which I was in need, to the number of two 
hundred and upwards.       But still I commenced not operations; indeed I 
was quite at a loss, being in a strange place and under very peculiar 
circumstances, to imagine the best course to pursue.       I therefore 
waited with perfect patience until it should please Providence to assist 
me, and true it is that help came in rather a remarkable manner.
I was standing in the courtyard of the Reyna posada, where for 
the time I had taken up my abode, when a man singularly dressed and 
gigantically tall entered.       My curiosity being excited, I enquired of 
the master of the house who he was, when he informed me that he was a 
foreigner who had resided a considerable time in Seville, and he believed a
Greek.       Upon hearing this I instantly went up to the stranger, and 
accosted him in the Greek language in which, though I speak it very ill, I 
can make myself understood.       He replied in the same idiom, and, 
flattered by the interest which I a foreigner expressed for his nation, was
not slow in communicating to me his history.       He told me, that his 
name was Dionysius; that he was a native of Cephalonia, and had been 
educated for the Church, which however not suiting his temper, he had 
abandoned in order to follow the profession of the sea, for which he had an
early inclination; that after many adventures and changes of fortune he 
found himself one morning on the coast of Spain       a shipwrecked 
mariner; and that, ashamed to return to his own country in poverty and 
distress, he had remained in the Peninsula, residing chiefly at Seville, 
where he now carried on a small trade in books.       He said that he was 
of the Greek religion, to which he professed strong attachment, and soon 
discovering that I was a Protestant, spoke with unbounded abhorrence of the
Papal system, nay of its followers in general, whom he called Latins, and 
whom he charged with the ruin of his own country, inasmuch as they sold it 
to the Turk.       It instantly struck me that this individual would be an 
excellent assistant in the work which had brought me to Seville, namely the
propagation of the eternal Gospel; and accordingly after some more 
conversation, in which he exhibited considerable learning, I explained 
myself to him.       He entered into my views with considerable eagerness; 
and hitherto I have had no reason to repent my confidence, he having 
disposed of a considerable number of New Testaments, and even contrived to 
send a certain number of copies to two small towns, at some distance from 
Seville.
On account of the extreme dearness of every article at the 
posada, where moreover I had a suspicion that I was watched, I 
removed with my servant and horses to an empty house in a solitary part of 
the town, where I still am, and where I purpose to remain during my stay in
Andalusia.       Here I live in the greatest privacy, admitting no person 
but two or three in whom I have the greatest confidence, who entertain the 
same views as myself and who assist me in the circulation of the 
Gospel.       One of these is a very remarkable person: an aged professor 
of music, by birth an old Castilian, and one of the very few who retain 
traces of the ancient Spanish character, which with all its faults, its 
stiffness, its formality, and its pride, I believe (always setting the 
character of the Christian aside) to be the most estimable and trustworthy 
in the world.       This venerable individual has just brought me the price
of six Testaments and a Gypsy Gospel, which he has this day sold under the 
heat of an Andalusian sun.       What was his motive?       A Christian 
one, truly.       He says that his unfortunate countrymen, who are at 
present robbing and murdering each other, may probably be rendered better 
by the reading of the Gospel, but cannot be injured: adding, that many a 
man has been reformed by the Scripture but that no one ever yet became a 
thief or assassin from its perusal.
I have not yet addressed myself much to the lower orders in these 
parts.       Indeed the quantity of books, at my disposal, at present 
remaining unsold in Spain is so small, that I am almost tempted to be 
niggard of them, lest in an unprovided hour an extraordinary call should be
made.       However, before leaving Seville, it will be well to pay some 
attention to the poor.       I have an agent awaiting my orders, another 
Greek, introduced to me by Dionysius; he is a labouring brick-layer, a 
native of the Morea, and has been upwards of thirty-five years in this 
country, so that he has almost entirely lost his native language; 
nevertheless his attachment to his own country is so strong, that he 
considers whatever is not Greek to be utterly barbarous and bad.       
Though entirely destitute of education he has, by his strength of character
and by a kind of rude eloquence which he possesses, obtained such a mastery
over the minds of the labouring classes of Seville that to everything he 
asserts they assent, however his assertions may shock their prejudices and 
Spanish pride; so that notwithstanding he is a foreigner he may at any time
become the Masaniello of Seville.       I am happy to be able to add
that he is an honest, industrious man notwithstanding his eccentricities, 
so that should I employ him, which I have not yet resolved upon, I may 
entertain perfect confidence that his actions will be no disparagement to 
the book he vends.
We are continually pressed for Bibles, which of course we cannot supply;
Testaments are held in comparatively little esteem.       Allow me to make 
here a remark which it is true I ought to have made three years ago; but we
live and learn.       It is unwise to print Testaments, and Testaments 
alone for Catholic countries.       The reason is plain.       The 
Catholic, unused to Scripture reading, finds a thousand things which he 
cannot possibly understand in the New Testament, the foundation of which is
the Old.              Search the Scriptures, for they bear witness to 
Me,        may well be applied to this point.       It may be replied that 
New Testaments separate are in great demand and of infinite utility in 
England.       But England, thanks be to the Lord, is not Spain; and though
an English labourer may read a Testament and derive from it the most 
blessed fruit, it does not follow that a Spanish peasant will enjoy similar
success, as he will find many dark things with which the other is well 
acquainted and competent to understand, being versed in the Bible history 
from his childhood.       I confess however that in the campaign of last 
summer we could not have accomplished with Bibles what Providence permitted
us to do with Testaments, the former being far too bulky for rural 
journeys.       In conclusion, I am glad to be able to say that one of my 
principal reasons for leaving Madrid was an inability to answer the 
pressing demands for Bibles which came pouring upon me every instant, and 
to which every person in the house where I lived can bear witness.       
Let the Revd. Doctor Wiseman get over this fact, who in his unchristian and
unfounded attack on the Bible Society has stated that it cannot dispose of 
its books at any price, nor indeed get rid of them gratis!
Dear Mrs. Browne shall have her letter.
G. B.
P.S.       I have just received Mr. Brandram       s 
epistle.       Present to him my best thanks for it, and above all for the 
remarks, which I will remember.       Pray let him send me the Pamphlet of 
the T. S.       I wish to see their observations on the Vulgate.       
Likewise the other papers.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. July 15, 1839)
Seville, Plazuela de la Pila
Seca, No. 7,
28 June 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I received your 
letter of the 22nd May, and likewise Mr. Jackson       s of the 5th June, 
containing the conclusion of the [Annual] Report, which you were so kind as
to send me.       I wish in the first place to say a few words, which some 
passages in your communication suggest.       Think not I pray you that any
observation of yours respecting style, or any peculiarities of expression 
which I am in the habit of exhibiting in my correspondence, can possibly 
awaken in me any feeling but that of gratitude, knowing so well as I do the
person who offers them, and the motives by which he is influenced.       I 
have reflected on those passages which you were pleased to point out as 
objectionable, and have nothing to reply further than that I have erred, 
that I am sorry, and will endeavour to mend, and that moreover I have 
already prayed for assistance so to do.       Allow me however to offer a 
word not in excuse but in explanation of the expression        wonderful 
good fortune        which appeared in a former letter of mine.       It is 
clearly objectionable, and, as you very properly observe, savours of pagan 
times.       But I am sorry to say that I am much in the habit of repeating
other people       s sayings without weighing their propriety.       The 
saying was not mine: but I heard it in conversation and thoughtlessly 
repeated it.       A few miles from Seville I was telling the courier of 
the many perilous journeys which I had accomplished in Spain in safety, and
for which I thanked the Lord.       His reply was:        La mucha 
suerte de Usted tambien nos ha acompa        ado en este 
viage.       
Your reply to the Trinitarian Society, for I suppose that it was written
by you, afforded me the highest satisfaction.       I admired its tone and 
spirit, and said at the time that a more convincing piece of reasoning had 
never been penned on any subject.       The case of Luther and the early 
Reformers, who were converted from the errors of Popery by the perusal of 
the Vulgate, the book of the Popish Church, is certainly exceedingly 
strong; as it at once does away with any argument which may be raised 
against the propriety of circulating versions made from it.       Perhaps 
it would have been as well to add that the Lollards        Bible, the book 
which converted England, was a literal translation from the Vulgate and not
from the original tongues, which, as is well knows, Wickliffe did not 
understand.       Those who decry the Vulgate should please to remember 
that, though adopted by the Popish Church, its foundation was laid before 
Popery existed, and that before criticising a book it is desirable to have 
read it.       There are faults in the Vulgate, indeed far too many; but I 
believe them to be more the result of infirmity than malice, all the heavy 
and strong texts most dangerous to the Papal system appearing in it 
uncurtailed and unmodified.       No people dread the Vulgate more than the
Papists themselves, which they know to be a terrible two-edged sword 
which will cut off their hands if they handle it.
I now beg leave to send you an extract of a letter which I received 
yesterday morning from Madrid.       It is from my landlady, who is my 
agent there, and I consider it to be my duty to communicate it to the 
Society, as I consider that it speaks volumes as to the state of affairs in
the capital and the spirit of enquiry abroad; at the same time I presume 
not to offer any comment upon it.       The rest of the letter treats of 
indifferent matters.
       The binder has brought me eight Bibles, which he has contrived to
make up out of the sheets gnawn by the rats, and which would have 
been necessary even had they amounted to eight thousand (y era necesario

href="#footnote422a" class="citation">[422a] because the people are 
innumerable who come to seek more.       Don Santiago has been here with 
some friends, who insisted upon having a part of them.       The Aragonese 
gentleman has likewise been, he who came before your departure and bespoke 
twenty-four.       He now wants twenty-five.       I begged them to take 
Testaments, but they would not.         a

We go on selling Testaments at Seville in a quiet satisfactory 
manner.       We have just commenced offering the book to the poor.       
That most remarkable individual, Johannes Chrysostom, the Greek bricklayer,
being the agent whom we employ.       I confess that we might sell more 
than we at present do, were we to press the matter; but we are cautious, 
and moreover our stock of Testaments is waning apace.       Two or three 
ladies of my acquaintance occasionally dispose of some amongst their 
friends, but they say that they experience some difficulty, the cry for 
Bibles being great.       Dionysius also tells me that for every Testament 
which he sells he could dispose of with ease fifty Bibles.       Within a 
few weeks I propose to cross the water to Ceuta and Tangiers with part of 
the books at present in embargo at San Lucar.       I shall take the 
liberty of giving you a full and minute description of the state of those 
places, the first of which has, I believe, never been visited by any one 
bearing the Gospel.       When I consider the immensity of what remains to 
be done, even in this inconsiderable portion of the globe, before wretched 
mortals can be brought to any sense of their lost and fallen state, I 
invariably lose all hope of anything efficient being accomplished by human 
means, unless it shall please the Almighty to make of straws and rushes 
weapons capable of cleaving the adamantine armour of superstition and 
unbelief.
It is eight o       clock at night, and Johannes Chrysostom has I just 
arrived from his labour.       I have not spoken to him; but I hear him 
below in the courtyard detailing to Antonio the progress he has made in the
last two days.       He speaks barbarous Greek, plentifully interlarded 
with Spanish words; but I gather from his discourse that he has already 
sold twelve Testaments among his fellow-labourers.       I hear copper coin
falling on the stones and Antonio, who is not of a very Christian temper, 
reproving him for not having brought the proceeds of the sale in 
silver.       He now asks for fifteen [Testaments] more, as he says the 
demand is becoming great, and that he shall have no difficulty in disposing
of them in the course of the morrow whilst pursuing his occupations.       
Antonio goes to fetch them, and he now stands alone by the little marble 
fountain, singing a wild song, which I believe to be a hymn of his beloved 
Greek Church.       Behold one of the helpers which the Lord has sent me in
my Gospel labours on the shores of the Guadalquivir.
Should you wish to transmit to me any part of the Report, I should 
conceive that you had best direct it to the care of Mr. Brackenbury at 
Cadiz, on whom I propose to call on my way to Ceuta, etc.       As for 
Cadiz itself, I have no intention of attempting to do any thing there, at 
least for the present.       After a great deal of gloomy and unsettled 
weather the genuine Andalusian summer has come upon us at last.       The 
brilliancy of the sun and the azure of the heavens are perfectly 
indescribable.       The people here complain sadly of the heat, but as for
myself, I luxuriate in it, like the butterflies which hover about the 
macetas, or flowerpots, in the court.       Hoping that you will 
present my remembrances to Mrs. Brandram, and likewise to all other dear 
friends, I remain Revd. and dear Sir, yours truly,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Aug. 5, 1839)
Seville, No. 7 Plazuela de 
la Pila Seca,
18th July 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       As I am about to 
leave Seville in a few days for San Lucar, Tangiers, and Ceuta, I wish 
before setting out to send a word or two in order that you may be 
acquainted with the state of matters up to the present moment.       Our 
work is concluded here for the season, and for the very efficient reason 
that I have no more Testaments to sell, somewhat more than two hundred 
having been circulated since my arrival.       A poor Genoese, the waiter 
at a Swiss ordinary, has just been with me requesting a dozen, which he 
says have been bespoken by people who frequent the house, but I have been 
obliged to send him away, it not being in my power to supply him.       
About ten days since I was visited by various alguacils, headed by 
the Alcalde del Barrio, or headborough, who made a small seizure of 
Testaments and Gypsy Gospels which happened to be lying about.       This 
visit was far from being disagreeable to me, as I considered it to be a 
very satisfactory proof of the effect of our exertions in Seville.       I 
cannot help here relating to you an anecdote.       A day or two 
subsequent, having occasion to call at the house of the headborough to 
complain of an act of dishonesty which had been committed by my porters, I 
found him lying on his bed, for it was the hour of the siesta, 
reading intently one of the very Testaments which he had taken 
away       all of which, if he had obeyed his orders, he would have 
deposited in the office of the Civil Governor.       So intently indeed was
he engaged in his reading that he did not at first observe my entrance; 
when he did, however, he sprang up in great confusion, and locked the book 
up in his cabinet; whereupon I smiled and told him to be under no alarm, as
I was glad to see him so usefully employed.       Recovering himself he 
said that he had read the book nearly through, and that he had found no 
harm in it, but on the contrary everything to praise, adding that he 
believed that the clergy must be possessed with devils 
(endemoniados) to persecute it in the manner which they did.
It was Sunday when the seizure was made, and I happened to be reading 
the Liturgy.       One of the alguacils when going away made an 
observation respecting the very different manner in which the Protestants 
and Catholics keep the Sabbath, the former being in their houses reading 
good books, and the latter abroad in the bull ring, seeing the wild bulls 
tearing out the gory bowels of the poor horses.       The bull amphitheatre
at Seville is, as you perhaps may have heard, the finest in all Spain, and 
is invariably on a Sunday, the only day in which it is open, filled with 
applauding multitudes.
I am happy to be able to say that the soil of Spain is now tolerably 
well broken up, and to a certain degree prepared for the labours of any 
future missionaries bearing the blessed Bible, who may visit this 
interesting part of the world.       We have had considerable difficulty 
hitherto in circulating Testaments, and we have merely been enabled to 
scatter about the thousands, which are now being read, by very 
extraordinary exertions.       Nevertheless when I take a large view of the
subject I feel inclined to believe that we were right in commencing our 
labours in the interior of Spain by printing an edition of the New 
Testament at Madrid.       I much doubt whether the astonishing demand for 
the Bible, which almost compelled me to leave the capital, and which now 
shows itself at Seville and other places, for example, Burgos, Valladolid, 
and Saint James of Galicia, to the great mortification of the Popish 
clergy, would have arisen but for the appearance of the New Testament which
awaked in people       s minds the desire of possessing the entire 
Scripture.       With great humility, however, I feel disposed to advise 
that provided at any future time the Society should think itself called 
upon to recommence its exertions here in the cause of a crucified Saviour, 
it employ, as its mighty instrument the Bible, the entire blessed Bible; 
having nevertheless always ready for distribution a certain quantity of 
Testaments, the wishes of weak human beings being influenced by such 
strange causes that it is probable that were it known at Madrid, or in 
other places, that there was a dearth of Testaments, the demand for the 
same would instantly become greater than for the entire Bible.
A few days since I received a communication from my correspondent at 
Saint James at Galicia, old Rey Romero, whom I have mentioned on a former 
occasion when residing there.       The good old man has sent me in his 
account, by which it appears that 115 copies of the New Testament were sold
at Saint James between the months of August 1837 and May 1838, at which 
time the further sale of the work was forbidden, and 35 copies, which 
remained unsold, placed in embargo.       The balance of the account in our
favour is 950 reals after deducting all expenses.       I shall 
preserve this letter with care, as I attach some importance to it.       
Who has not heard of Saint James of Compostella, the temple of the great 
image of the patron of Spain, and the most favourite resort in the world of
benighted Popish pilgrims?       Nevertheless 115 copies of the pure 
unadulterated Word of God were purchased there in a few months at the high 
price of ten reals each.       I humbly beg leave to refer you to my
account of that remarkable place, and to hope that in the statement of 
proceedings in Spain it will not be forgotten.       64 copies, it appears,
were also sold in the small town of Lugo, also in Galicia, and 56 at Leon, 
the capital of the ancient kingdom of the same name, and which perhaps may 
be considered as the least enlightened and most fanatic place in all 
Spain.
By advice from Madrid from Mrs. Maria Diaz, whom I charged with the care
of the property of the Bible Society in that place, it appears that there 
remain unsold:       
Of Testaments, 962
Of Gospels in the Gypsy tongue, 286
Of ditto in Basque, 394
The quantity of Testaments would not have been so large had I not 
recovered before leaving Madrid upwards of two hundred, which had been 
placed in embargo at Santander and subsequently removed to the 
capital.       On a rough account, therefore, I should say that about three
thousand have been sold during the last twelve months in the interior of 
Spain, for which I give praise to God with the humility and gratitude 
due.       Of those which remain I should wish to be permitted on my return
from my present expedition to circulate some in La Mancha, especially at 
Manzanares and Valdepe        as.       The state of that province is truly
horrible; it appears peopled partly with spectres and partly with 
demons.       There is famine, and such famine; there is assassination, and
such unnatural assassination.       There you see soldiers and robbers, 
ghastly lepers and horrible and uncouth maimed and blind, exhibiting their 
terrible nakedness in the sun.       I was prevented last year in carrying 
the Gospel amongst them.       May I be more successful this.
I now beg leave to conclude my tedious letter with requesting that you 
will be kind enough to send the enclosed communication to my friend in 
Russia.       I hope you will pardon the trouble I am giving you, but I 
have no other resource, as there is no direct mode of communication between
Russia and Spain.       Present my kind remembrances to dear Mr. Jowett and
other friends, and believe me to remain, Revd. and dear Sir,
Ever truly yours,
G. B.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Oct. 7, 1839)
Tangiers, September 4, 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I have now been 
nearly one month in this place, and should certainly have written to you 
before had I possessed any secure means of despatching a letter; but there 
is no mail from Tangiers to any part of the world, so that when writing one
is obliged to have recourse to the disagreeable necessity of confiding 
letters to individuals who chance to be going to Gibraltar to be put into 
the post there, who not unfrequently lose or forget them.       One which I
wrote for Spain has already miscarried, which circumstance makes me 
cautious.       I will now relate the leading events which have occurred to
me since my departure from Seville, observing however that I have kept a 
regular journal, which on the first opportunity I shall transmit for the 
satisfaction of my friends at home.       You are already aware that I had 
determined to carry the Scripture in Spanish to the Christian families 
established on the sea-coast of Barbary, and more especially Tangiers, the 
Spanish language being in general use among them, whether Spaniards by 
birth or Genoese, French or English.       To enable me to do this, having 
no copies of the sacred volume at Seville, I determined to avail myself of 
a certain number of Testaments in embargo at the custom-house of San Lucar 
a town at the mouth of the Guadalquivir, forming part of the stock seized 
by order of the Government and which I had been officially requested to 
remove from Spain.       I started from Seville on the night of the 31st of
July in one of the steamers which ply upon the Guadalquivir, arriving at 
San Lucar early in the morning.       I shall now make an extract from my 
journal, relative to the Testaments.
       It will be as well here to curtail what relates to these books, 
otherwise the narrative might be considerably embarrassed.       They 
consisted of a chest of Testaments in Spanish, and a small box of Saint 
Luke       s Gospel in the Gitano or language of the Spanish Gypsies.      
I obtained them from the custom-house of San Lucar with a pass for that of 
Cadiz.       At Cadiz I was occupied two days, and also a person whom I 
employed, in going through all the required formalities and in procuring 
the necessary papers.       The expense was great, as money was demanded at
every step I took, though I was simply complying with the orders of the 
Spanish Government in removing prohibited books from Spain.       The farce
did not end till after my arrival at Gibraltar, where I paid the Spanish 
consul a dollar for certifying on the back of the pass that the books had 
arrived, which pass I was obliged to send back to Cadiz.       It is true 
that he never saw the books nor enquired about them; but he received the 
money, for which alone he seemed to be anxious.
       Whilst at the custom-house of San Lucar, I was asked one or two 
questions respecting the books contained in the chests; this afforded me 
some opportunity of speaking of the New Testament and the Bible 
Society.       What I said excited attention, and presently all the 
officers and dependents of the house, great and small, were gathered around
me, from the governor to the porter.       As it was necessary to open the 
boxes to inspect their contents, we all proceeded to the courtyard where, 
holding a Testament in my hand, I recommenced my discourse.       I 
scarcely know what I said, for I was much agitated and hurried away by my 
feelings, when I bethought me of the manner in which the Word of God was 
persecuted in the unhappy kingdom of Spain.       My words however 
evidently made impression, and to my astonishment every person present 
pressed me for a copy.       I sold several within the walls of the 
custom-house.       The object, however, of most attention was the Gypsy 
Gospel, which was minutely examined amidst smiles and exclamations of 
surprise, some individual every now and then crying        Cosas de los 
Ingleses.              A bystander asked me whether I could speak the 
Gitano language.       I replied that I could not only speak it but write 
it, and instantly made a speech of about five minutes in the Gypsy tongue, 
which I had no sooner concluded than all clapped their hands, and 
simultaneously shouted,        Cosas de los Ingleses!       Cosas
de los Ingleses!              I disposed of several Gypsy Gospels 
likewise, and having now settled the business which brought me to the 
custom-house, I saluted my new friends and departed with my books.
       I strolled from the inn to view the town.       It was past noon,
and the heat was exceedingly fierce . . . I became tired of gazing, and was
retracing my steps, when I was accosted by two Gypsies, men who by some 
means had heard of my arrival.       We exchanged some words in Gitano, but
they appeared to be very ignorant of the language, and utterly unable to 
maintain a conversation in it.       They were clamorous for a 
gabicote, or book, in Gypsy.       I refused it them, saying that 
they could turn it to no profitable account; and learning that they could 
read, promised them each a Testament in Spanish.       This offer, however,
they refused with disdain, saying that they cared for nothing written in 
the language of the Busn         or Gentiles.       They then 
persisted in their demand, to which I at last yielded, being unable to 
resist their importunity; whereupon they accompanied me to the inn, and 
received what they so ardently desired.       
I arrived at Cadiz on the second day of August, when I waited upon Mr. 
Brackenbury, the British consul-general.       His house, which is the 
corner one at the entrance of the Alameda or public walk, enjoys a 
noble prospect of the bay, and is very large and magnificent.       I had 
of course long been acquainted with Mr. B. by reputation.       I knew that
for many years he had filled with advantage to his native country and with 
honour to himself the distinguished and highly responsible situation which 
he holds in Spain.       I knew likewise that he was a good and pious 
Christian, and moreover the firm and enlightened friend of the Bible 
Society.       Of all this I was aware; but I had never enjoyed the 
advantage of being personally acquainted with him.       I saw him now 
indeed for the first time.       I was much struck with his appearance; 
there is much dignity in his countenance, which is, however, softened by an
expression of good humour truly captivating and engaging.       His manner 
is frank and affable in the extreme.       I am not going to enter into 
minute details of our interview, which was a very interesting one to 
myself.       He knew already the leading parts of my history since my 
arrival in Spain, and made several comments thereon which displayed his 
intimate knowledge of the situation of Spain, as regards ecclesiastical 
matters, and the state of opinion respecting religious innovation.       I 
was flattered to find that his ideas in many points accorded with my own, 
and we were both decidedly of opinion that, notwithstanding the great 
persecution and outcry which had lately been raised against the Gospel, the
battle was by no means lost in Spain, and that we might yet hope to see the
holy cause triumph.
During my stay at Cadiz I experienced every kind of hospitality from Mr.
B. and his charming family.       Upon my departure he supplied me with a 
letter of introduction to Mr. Hay, the British consul at Tangiers, which I 
have since learned was most flattering to myself and worded in the most 
energetic manner.       I quitted Cadiz on the morning of Sunday, the 4th 
August, in the steamer Balear, arriving at Gibraltar on the evening 
of the same day.       Nothing particular occurred to me during my stay at 
Gibraltar, where I engaged my passage on board a small trading vessel for 
Tangiers.       We were detained by various causes until Thursday the 8th, 
when we sailed about noon, and assisted by a strong and favourable wind we 
reached the harbour of Tangiers before sunset.       I was not permitted to
go on shore that night, my passport and bill of health having first to be 
examined by the authorities.       Early however on the following morning, 
Mr. Hay, who had received Mr. Brackenbury       s letters of introduction, 
sent a Moorish soldier and his own servant to conduct me to his house, 
where he received me in the kindest manner.       He had already procured 
me a comfortable lodging in the house of a Christian woman where I have 
remained ever since my arrival at Tangiers, constantly receiving every 
species of attention and civility from Mr. Hay.
Tangiers stands on the side of a rather steep hill which rises above the
sea.       It is a walled town, and towards the water is defended with 
batteries mounted with heavy cannon.       The streets are very numerous 
and intersect each other in all directions; they are narrow and 
precipitous, and the houses low, small and mean.       The principal 
mosque, or jamma [djmah] is rather a handsome edifice, and 
its tower, or sumah, which is built of bricks of various colours, 
presents a picturesque appearance when viewed from the sea: of its interior
I can of course say little, as any Christian who should venture to intrude 
would be instantly cast forth and probably killed by the populace.       
About half way up the hill within the town there is a small market-place 
called in the language of the country soc.       It is surrounded 
with little shops or booths, in which all kinds of dry fruits, such as 
dates, raisins, almonds, and walnuts are exposed for sale, and also honey, 
soap, sugar, and such other articles of grocery.       These little shops 
are not in general kept by Moors, but by people from the country of Suz, 
who speak a different language from the Moors, and are of a different race,
being a branch of the Berber stem; they are the grocers of Barbary and are,
in comparison with the Moors, an honest, peaceable, and industrious 
people.       The castle of the Governor stands at the northern extremity 
of Tangiers, on the top of a high eminence which towers above the town; its
outer walls embrace a very large portion of ground, which is principally 
occupied by large edifices in the greatest dilapidation and decay.       
The castle itself when I visited it was undergoing repair, during the 
absence of the pasha who has since returned.       All its inlets and 
outlets and also the greatest part of the apartments were choked up with 
ruins, rubbish, and mortar.       The courtyard however is very fine, and 
is adorned with a fountain distilling limpid water, which is a rare 
spectacle in Tangiers where water is not in abundance.       At each end of
this court there is a hall of audience, highly magnificent in its way, with
a roof of rich fretted work in the old Moorish taste, such as I have seen 
in the Alhambra of Granada, and in that truly fairy palace the Alcazar of 
Seville.
Tangiers contains a population of about twenty thousand souls, of which 
at least one-third are Jews: the Christian portion does not amount to about
two hundred and fifty individuals, including the various consuls and their 
families.       These latter gentlemen enjoy considerable authority in the 
town, so much so that in all disputes between Moors and Christians they 
alone are the judges, and their decision is law; they are a very 
respectable body, being without one exception exceedingly well-bred 
gentlemanly individuals, and several of them, particularly Mr Hay, the 
British consul-general, possessed of high literary attainments.       They 
enjoy very large salaries from their respective governments, varying from 
ten to sixteen thousand dollars per annum, so that, as all the necessaries 
and indeed many of the luxuries of life may be obtained at a very cheap 
price at Tangiers, they live in a state of magnificence more akin to that 
of petty kings than consuls in general.       The most perfect harmony 
exists amongst them, and if, at any time, any little dispute occur between 
two or three of them, the rest instantly interfere and arrange matters; and
they are invariably united to a man against the slightest infringement of 
their privileges and immunities on the part of the Moorish Government, and 
a slight or injury to one is instantly resented by all.       The duties of
the greatest part of them are far from being onerous, more especially as 
each is provided with a vice-consul, who is also an exceedingly well-bred 
and very well-paid gentleman.       They pass the greatest part of their 
time in cultivating their delicious gardens, which, surrounded by hedges of
ksob, which is a species of gigantic reed, cover the hills in the 
vicinity of Tangiers.       Their houses, which are palace-looking 
buildings in the European taste and which contrast strangely with the mean 
huts of the Moors, are all surmounted by a flag-staff, which on gala days 
displays the banner of its respective nation.       It is curious then to 
gaze from the castle hill on the town below; twelve banners are streaming 
in the wind of the Levant, which blows here almost incessantly.       One 
is the bloody flag of the Moor, the natural master of the soil; but the 
eleven are of foreigners and Nazarenes, and are emblems of distant and 
different people.       There floats the meteor banner of England beside 
the dirty rags of Spain and Portugal.       There the pride of Naples, of 
Sardinia, and Sweden.       There the angry tricolor; and not far from it 
the most beautiful of all, the Dannebrog of Denmark, a white cross gleaming
consolingly amidst blood and fire, as when first seen by Waldemar; 
neighbour to it the Austrian; there the Orange; and yonder, far remote from
all, like the country, the stripes and stars of the United States.       
Tangiers, with a Moorish and Jewish population, is not the city either of 
the Moor or the Jew: it is that of the consuls.
Were it possible for any unprejudiced and rational being to doubt for a 
moment that the religion of Mahomet is a false one and uncalculated to 
promote the moral and political improvement of mankind, a slight glance at 
this Mahometan country would be sufficient to undeceive him.       The 
Moors are the most fanatic of all Mahometans, and consider the Turks, 
Persians, and other followers of the Desert-Prophet, as seceders from the 
severe precepts of their religion.       What is their state?       They 
are governed in their towns and provinces by arbitrary despots called 
Pashas, who are accountable to no person but the Emperor, whose authority 
they frequently set at nought, and who is himself a despot of the most 
terrible description.       Their lives, properties, and families are 
perfectly at the disposal of these men, who decapitate, imprison, plunder, 
and violate as their inclination tempts them.       In this country it is 
every person       s interest, however wealthy, to exhibit an appearance of
abject poverty; as the suspicion of wealth instantly produces from the 
Sultan or Pasha a demand for some large sum, which must be forthwith paid 
or decapitation or torture are the severe alternatives.       Here justice 
is indeed an empty name, the most atrocious criminals escaping unpunished 
if able to offer a bribe sufficient to tempt the cupidity of those whose 
duty it is to administer it.       Here money is sought after with 
insatiable avidity by great and small, for its own sake, and not for what 
it will produce.       It is piled up in the treasury or is buried 
underground, according to the situation in life of its possessors.       In
this land there is neither public peace or individual security; no one 
travels a league but at the extreme danger of his life, and war is 
continually raging not against foreign enemies but amongst the people 
themselves.       The Sultan collects armies and marches against this or 
that province, which is sure to be in a state of rebellion; if successful, 
a thousand heads are borne before him on his return in ghastly triumph on 
the lances of his warriors; and if vanquished, his own not unfrequently 
blackens in the sun above the gate of some town or village.       Here 
truth and good faith are utterly unknown, friendship exists not, nor kindly
social intercourse; here pleasure is sought in the practice of abominations
or in the chewing of noxious and intoxicating drugs; here men make a pomp 
and a parade of their infamy; and the cavalcade which escorts with jealous 
eye the wives and concubines of the potentate on a march or journey is also
charged with the care of his zammins, the unfortunate youths who 
administer to his fouler passions.       Such is the moral, and the 
political state of Morocco!       Such are the fruits of a religion which 
is not that of the Bible.
The state of the Jews in this country is in every respect 
pitiable.       It is one of great thraldom, yet is nevertheless far 
superior to what it was previous to the accession of the present monarch 
Muley Abd al Rahman to the throne; before that period they enjoyed scarcely
any of the rights of human beings, and were plundered, beaten, and maimed 
by the Moslems at pleasure.       As the Moors of Barbary are the most 
fanatic amongst the Mahometans, so are the Barbary Jews the most 
superstitious of their race, observing in the strictest manner the precepts
of the Talmud and the sages.       A great many singular ceremonies and 
usages are to be found amongst them which are not observed by the Hebrews 
in any other part of the world, more especially at their wedding festivals 
which are carried on during a period of eleven days, during which the house
which is open to all comers exhibits a continual scene of dancing, 
feasting, and revelry of every description.       There is much at these 
marriages which has served to remind me of those of the Gitanos of Spain at
which I have been frequently present, especially the riot and waste 
practised; for like the Gitano, the Barbary Jew frequently spends during 
the days of his wedding not only all that he is possessed of, but becomes 
an embarrassed man for the rest of his life by the sums which he is 
compelled to borrow in order not to incur the opprobrium of appearing mean 
on so solemn an occasion.       The books current among them are the Bible 
with the commentaries of the rabbins, parts of the Mischna, and the prayers
for all the year; likewise, but more rare, the Zohar, which all speak of 
with unbounded veneration, though few pretend to understand it.       I 
have not unfrequently seen at their synagogues the Bible Society       s 
edition of the Psalms, and they appeared to prize it highly.
A market is held on every Thursday and Sunday morning beyond the walls 
of Tangiers in a place called the Soc de Barra or outward 
market-place.       Thither repair the Moors from the country, bringing 
with them corn, fruit and other articles, the productions of their fields 
and gardens for the consumption of the town.       It is my delight to 
visit this spot which is on the side of a hill, and sitting down on a stone
to gaze.       What a singular scene presents itself to the view: a wild 
confusion of men and horses, of donkeys and camels, of countenances of all 
hues, swarthy and black, livid and pale, of turbans of all dyes, white, 
green and red, of Jewish skull-caps with here and there an Andalusian hat, 
of haiks and gaberdines, of arrogant Moors, indifferent Europeans and 
cringing Hebrews, the latter walking barefooted in the place where the corn
is sold, which the Moor says is sacred and unfit to be pressed by the 
sandals of the dog-Jew.       What a hubbub of sounds: the unearthly cry of
the enormous camels and the neighing, braying, and bleating of other 
quadrupeds, mingled with the discordant jabber of various and strange 
tongues.       I have been in many singular places in the course of my 
existence, but certainly in none more so than the Soc de Barra of 
Tangiers.
There is much Spanish spoken in this place, especially amongst the Jews;
it is also generally understood by the Europeans.       The prevalent 
language however is the Arabic, or rather a dialect of it called by some 
Mograbbin.       I was glad to find that I could make myself very well 
understood with the Arabic of the East, notwithstanding that it differs in 
many points from the Mograbbin, or language of the West.       One thing 
has particularly struck me; namely that the wild people, who arrive from 
the far interior and who perhaps have never before seen a European, 
invariably understand me best, and frequently in conversation designate 
objects with the same words as myself, which however are not intelligible 
to the Moors of the coast.       I am by this time exceedingly well known 
at Tangiers, indeed I take the best means of being so by entering into 
discourse with every person.       I believe I am liked by the Moors and am
certainly treated with much respect by the Jews amongst whom a report 
prevails that I am a Polish rabbi.       Shortly after my arrival I was 
visited by the most wealthy Jewish merchant of Tangiers, who pressed me in 
the strongest manner to take up my abode at his house, assuring me [that I 
should live] at free cost, and be provided with all the comforts and 
luxuries which could be procured.
I will now proceed to relate what has been accomplished in the cause of 
the Gospel since my arrival at Tangiers.       I will endeavour to be as 
concise as possible, reserving some particulars until a future 
occasion.       For the first fortnight I accomplished nothing, and indeed 
attempted nothing in the way of distribution, being occupied in making 
myself acquainted with the place and studying the character of its 
inhabitants.       I occasionally spoke to the Christians, who are 
principally Genoese and Spanish sailors and their families, on the subject 
of religion, but with the greatest caution, being unwilling to alarm the 
two or three friars who reside in what is called the Spanish convent, who 
are the only officiating Christian priests of the place, and who might have
warned their flock against the heretic intruder.       I found, as I had 
anticipated, great ignorance among these poor people respecting the most 
important points of the religion which they profess, and the Gospel of God 
they had never seen nor heard of.       At the end of the above-mentioned 
period I employed a Jewish youth to carry the Testament to their houses and
to offer it to them for sale.       It is with humble gratitude to the Lord
that I am able to state that considerable success crowned our 
efforts.       The blessed Book is now in the hands of most of the 
Christians of Tangiers, from the lowest to the highest, from the fisherman 
to the consul.       One dozen and a half were carried to Tetuan on 
speculation, a town about six leagues from hence; they will be offered to 
the Christians who reside there.       Other two dozen are on their way to 
distant Mogadore.       One individual, a tavern-keeper, has purchased 
Testaments to the number of thirty, which he says he has no doubt he can 
dispose of to the foreign sailors, who stop occasionally at his 
house.       You will be surprised to hear that several amongst the Jews 
have purchased copies of the New Testament, with the intention as they 
state of improving themselves in Spanish, but I believe from 
curiosity.       Whatever their motive be, let them but once read this holy
Book and I have no fear of their remaining enemies of the Lamb whom their 
fathers crucified.       I regret that only few can read the Spanish 
language, their law forbidding them to read or write any characters but the
Hebrew.       Had I the New Testament to offer them in the latter tongue, I
believe that I could dispose of thousands of copies in Barbary.       My 
work being completed here for the present, I now hasten back to Seville; 
pray write to me speedily directing to the usual place.
I remain, Revd and dear Sir,
Truly yours,
G. Borrow.
To the Rev. G. Browne
(Endorsed: recd. Oct. 7, 1839)
Cadiz, Sepr. 21 [1839].
Revd. and dear Sir and excellent 
Friend,       I arrived at Cadiz this morning by a small 
coasting-vessel, after undergoing a quarantine of four days at 
Tarifa.       On calling at Mr. Brackenbury       s I received your kind 
communication of the 29th July, acquainting me with the resolution of the 
Committee.
Had I been aware of that resolution before my departure for Tangiers, I 
certainly should not have gone.       My expedition, however, was the 
result of much reflection.       I wished to carry the Gospel to the 
Christians of the Barbary shore who were much in want of it; and I had one 
hundred and thirty Testaments at San Lucar which I could only make 
available by exportation.       The success which it has pleased the Lord 
to yield me in my humble efforts at distribution in Barbary will, I 
believe, prove the best criterion as to the fitness of the enterprise.
I stated in my last communication to Mr. Brandram the plan which I 
conceived to be the best for circulating that portion of the edition of the
New Testament which remains unsold at Madrid, and I scarcely needed a 
stimulant in the execution of my duty.       At present however I know not 
what to do; I am sorrowful, disappointed, and unstrung.
I wish to return to England as soon as possible; but I have books and 
papers at Madrid which are of much importance to me and which I cannot 
abandon.       This perhaps alone prevents me embarking in the next 
packet.       I have moreover brought with me from Tangiers the Jewish 
youth who so powerfully assisted me in that place in the work of 
distribution.       I had hoped to have made him of service in Spain; he is
virtuous and clever.       My servant Antonio I was compelled to send back 
to Madrid ere my departure from Seville on account of his many 
irregularities.
I am almost tempted to ask whether some strange, some unaccountable 
delusion does not exist.       What should induce me to stay in Spain, as 
you appear to suppose I intend?       I may, however, have misunderstood 
you.       I wish to receive a fresh communication as soon as possible 
either from yourself or Mr. Brandram; in the meantime I shall go to 
Seville, to which place and to the usual number pray direct.
I enclose the last letter which I received from the firm of 
O       Shea, from which it will appear that I received [word missing] 
thirty of the fifty pounds drawn for: the residue covers the expenses at 
Madrid, of which I defray one-half, the books being deposited at my 
lodgings.       I shall shortly send in my account for the last four 
months.       Pray present my kind remembrances to Mrs. B. and believe me 
to remain, Revd. and dear Sir,
Ever truly yours,
G. B.
P.S.       Best regards also to Messrs. Brandram and Jowett.
I have this moment received a letter from Seville, which was awaiting my
arrival at the post office.       The British consul states that the Bibles
in embargo there are at the disposal of the Society; this is the work of my
friend Mr. Southern at Madrid, for had he not exerted his powerful interest
in the matter they were lost, and could not even have been exported.       
To whom shall I send them?       To Gibraltar, or to England?
To the Rev. A. Brandram (Private)
(Endorsed: recd. Octr. 14, 1839)
Seville, Plazuela de la Pila
Seca No. 7,
29th Sepr. 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I beg leave to 
return you my best thanks for your kind communication of the 27th Aug. 
which I found awaiting me on my return from Tangiers, and for which I was 
already to a certain degree prepared by my dear friend Mr. Browne       s 
letter directed to the care of Mr. Brackenbury at Cadiz.       I shall act 
up as soon as possible to the Committee       s request, that I take 
immediate measures for selling the remainder of our Bible stock in Spain, 
or leaving it in safe custody.       I will now tell you in a few words the
steps which it appears to me most advisable to take in the present 
emergency.
I shall mount my horses and depart for La Mancha; where I shall take up 
my abode for a few weeks in a town with which you are already acquainted 
and where I believe I have friends, and to which place I shall order a 
chest of Testaments to be despatched from Madrid, on the receipt of which I
shall endeavour with the assistance of Hayim Ben Attar to put as many 
copies as possible into circulation.       I have always wished to do 
something in La Mancha, which is in every respect the worst part of 
Spain.       I distinctly see that it must be now or never.       God has 
granted me success in many difficult enterprises: perhaps it will please 
Him to favour me in this.
I shall then move upon Madrid, and arrange matters in that 
capital.       If I may be permitted here to offer my advice, I would 
strongly recommend that four hundred copies of the New Testament be left 
there in deposit, with those of Saint Luke in Gypsy and Basque which remain
unsold.       Of the former Gospel, indeed, there are not many, nearly one 
hundred copies having been circulated amongst the Rommanees of Andalusia 
during my present visit.       I then purpose to make for France, passing 
through Saragossa, in which place, which is large and populous, I hope to 
accomplish some good in the Lord       s cause.       This is the outline 
of my plan, which I shall attempt to put into execution without delay; 
though if any one could propose a wiser, and better adapted to the present 
circumstances, I shall at once relinquish it.
I have just received a communication from Mr. Brackenbury, in which he 
has done me the honour to furnish me with a copy of a letter which he has 
addressed to yourself and in which he has spoken of me.       The principal
consolation of a person in misfortune is the being able to say,        In 
whatever I have done, I have had the glory of God at heart       ; and 
certainly next to this consolation is the knowledge that his deeds and 
actions meet the approbation of the good, the wise, and the 
distinguished.       I wish not to recapitulate what I have done, but I beg
to be permitted to say that wherever I have been I have endeavoured to 
elicit the kindly feelings of my fellow-creatures, not for my own benefit 
but for the advancement of the true doctrine.       I found Mr. B. during 
my last visit in a state of considerable agitation.       He showed me a 
letter from Lord. P [Palmerston], a circular as it appeared, in which the 
British consuls and their assistants in Spain are strictly forbidden to 
afford the slightest countenance to religious agents.       What was the 
cause of this last blow?       Mr. B. says it was an ill-advised 
application made to his Lordship to interfere with the Spanish Government 
in behalf of a certain individual whose line of conduct needs no 
comment.       There are people in Spain who remember the time when those 
very consuls received from a British Ambassador at Madrid instructions of 
an exactly contrary character; but when dead flies fall into the ointment 
of the apothecary, they cause it to send forth an unpleasant savour.
I am very glad that I went to Tangiers, for many reasons.       In the 
first place, I was permitted to circulate many copies of God       s Word 
both amongst the Jews and the Christians, by the latter of whom it was 
particularly wanted, their ignorance of the most vital points of religion 
being truly horrible.       In the second place, I acquired a vast stock of
information concerning Africa and the state of its interior.       One of 
my principal associates was a black slave, whose country was only three 
days        journey from Timbuctoo, which place he had frequently 
visited.       The Soosi men also told me many of the secrets of the land 
of wonders from which they come, and the rabbis from Fez and Morocco were 
no less communicative.       Moreover I consider it a great advantage to 
have obtained the friendship of Mr. Hay, who is a true British 
gentleman.       I found him at first reserved and distant, and I thought 
averse to countenance the object of my mission.       In a few days, 
however, his manner changed surprisingly, and at my departure he begged me 
to communicate to the Bible Society that at all times and seasons he should
be happy to receive its commands, and to render all the assistance in Fez 
and Morocco which his official situation would permit him, should the views
of the Society at any future time be directed to those regions.
Permit me, my dear Sir, to correct in your letter something which 
savours of inaccuracy.       You hint at the issues of the Scriptures in 
Spain having been small.       Now during the last year I have issued three
thousand Testaments and five hundred Bibles, which is certainly no small 
circulation of the Word of God in such a country.       But pray inform me 
why the circulation has not been ten times greater?       Surely you are 
aware that among the many peculiarities of my situation was this 
distressing one, namely, that I was scarcely ever able to supply the people
with the books that they were in want of.       They clamoured for Bibles, 
and I had nothing but Testaments to offer them.       Had I been possessed 
of twenty thousand Bibles in the spring of the present year, I could have 
disposed of them all without leaving Madrid; and they would have found 
their way through all Spain.       I beseech you always to bear this fact 
in mind in your reports to the public, otherwise that public will remain 
strangely in the dark respecting the spirit of enquiry which is abroad in 
Spain.
You are quite right in supposing that I entertain a favourable opinion 
of Mr. Wood.       I know him to be a good husband and father, and a man 
who fears the Lord: he is likewise possessed of considerable ability; but I
am entirely unacquainted with any plan which he may have formed respecting 
printing the Scriptures in Spain, or any memorial which he may have sent in
to the Bible Society on the subject, so that of course I cannot be expected
to express an opinion.       It is my intention in a few days to depart 
from hence on my expedition, so that should you be desirous of writing to 
me, you had perhaps best address to Madrid.
When the Bible Society has no further occasion for my poor labours, I 
hope it will do me justice to the world.       I have been its faithful and
zealous servant.       I shall on a future occasion take the liberty of 
addressing you as a friend respecting my prospects.       I have the 
materials of a curious book of travels in Spain; I have enough metrical 
translations from all languages, especially the Celtic and Sclavonic, to 
fill a dozen volumes; and I have formed a vocabulary of the Spanish Gypsy 
tongue, and also a collection of the songs and poetry of the Gitanos with 
introductory essays.       Perhaps some of these literary labours might be 
turned to account.       I wish to obtain honourably and respectably the 
means of visiting China, or particular parts of Africa.       I call this 
letter private, but communicate such parts of it as you think proper.

To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Dec. 19, 1839)
Prison of Seville, Novr. 25, 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I write these lines
as you see from the common prison of Seville, to which I was led yesterday,
or rather dragged, neither for murder nor robbery nor debt but simply for 
having endeavoured to obtain a passport for Cordova, to which place I was 
going with my Jewish servant, Hayim Ben Attar.
It is necessary for me here to give you some information respecting my 
proceedings since I last wrote.       I wished to distribute some more 
Testaments in Seville before I left the country, and accordingly procured a
considerable number from Madrid.       Everything was accomplished with the
utmost secrecy, and the blessed books obtained considerable 
circulation.       I likewise sent agents into the country, and went myself
in my accustomed manner.       All went well, the entire stock which had 
reached me was circulated, and I rested from my labours for a little time; 
for indeed I had need of quiet, being indisposed.
Some English people now came to Seville and distributed tracts in a very
unguarded manner, knowing nothing of the country or the inhabitants.       
They were even so unwise as to give tracts instead of money on visiting 
public buildings, etc.       These persons came to me, and 
requested my co-operation and advice, and likewise introductions to people 
spiritually disposed amongst the Spaniards, to all which requests I 
returned a decided negative.       But I foresaw all.       In a day or two
I was summoned before the Gefe Politico or, as he was once called, 
Corregidor of Seville, who I must say treated me with the utmost 
politeness, and indeed respect; but at the same time he informed me that he
had (to use his own expression) terrible orders from Madrid concerning me, 
if I should be discovered in the act of distributing the Scriptures or any 
writings of a religious tendency.       He then taxed me with having 
circulated both lately, especially tracts: whereupon I told him that I had 
never distributed a tract since I had been in Spain, nor had any intention 
of doing so.       We had much conversation and parted in kindness.       I
went away for a few days, though without intending to do anything, and 
wrote to the firm of O       Shea for money, of which I stood in need and 
which I received.       I now determined to make for La Mancha and to put 
my plan into execution, which I should have done sooner had the roads been 
a little more secure.       Yesterday I sent my passport to be signed by 
the Alcalde del Barrio.       This fellow is the greatest ruffian in
Seville, and I have on various occasions been insulted by him; he pretends 
to be a liberal, but is of no principle at all, and as I reside within his 
district he has been employed by the Canons of the cathedral to vex and 
harass me on every possible occasion.       (By the way, the hatred which 
these last people nourish against me amounts almost to frenzy, and scarcely
a day passes by in which they do not send in false accusations against me 
to the Gefe Politico; they have even gone so far as to induce people
to perjure themselves by swearing that I have sold or given them books, 
people whom I have never seen nor heard of; and the same system was carried
on whilst I was in Africa, for they are so foolishly suspicious that they 
could not be persuaded that I was out of Seville.)       The 
above-mentioned Alcalde refused to sign the passport, though he was 
bound to do so, it being quite in form, and insulted the messenger: 
whereupon I sent the latter back with money to pay any fees lawful or 
unlawful which might be demanded, as I wished to avoid noise and the 
necessity of applying to the consul, Mr. Williams.       But the fellow 
became only more outrageous.       I then went myself to demand an 
explanation and was called all the vilest names contained in the Spanish 
German        a (Billingsgate), whereupon I told him that if he 
proceeded in this manner I would make a complaint to the authorities 
through the consul.       He then said that if I did not instantly depart 
he would drag me off to prison, and cause me to be knocked down if I made 
the slightest resistance.       I dared him repeatedly to do both, and said
that he was a disgrace to the Government which employed him and to human 
nature.       He called me a heretic.       We were now in the street and a
mob was collected, whereupon I cried        Viva Inglaterra, y 
viva La Constitucion.              The populace seemed disposed to side
with me, notwithstanding the exhortations of the monster to them that they 
would knock down the foreigner, for he himself quailed before me as 
I looked him in the eyes defying him.       He at last ran to a 
neighbouring guard-house, and requested the assistance of the Nationals in 
conducting me to prison.       I followed him and delivered myself up at 
the first summons, and walked to the prison without uttering a word: not so
the ruffian, who continued his abuse until we arrived at the gate.       I 
was asked my name by the authorities of the prison, which I refused to give
unless in the presence of the consul, and indeed to answer any 
questions.       I was then ordered to the patio or courtyard, where
are kept the lowest thieves and assassins of Seville, who having no money 
cannot pay for better accommodation, and by whom I should have been 
stripped naked in a moment as a matter of course, as they are all in a 
state of raging hunger and utter destitution.       I asked for a private 
cell, which I was told I might have if I could pay for it.       I stated 
my willingness to pay anything which might be demanded, and was conducted 
to an upper ward, consisting of several cells and a corridor.       Here I 
found six or seven prisoners who received me very civilly, and instantly 
procured me paper and ink for the purpose of writing to the consul.       
In less than an hour Mr. Williams arrived and I told him my story, at which
he wondered, as he well might, and presently departed in order to demand 
redress of the authorities.       The next morning I was informed that the 
ruffian the Alcalde had upon his own authority entered my house and 
searched for prohibited books, hoping, if he found any, to justify to a 
certain degree his conduct to me.       He found none, and is now quite in 
my power, without a shadow of excuse       he having entered by force the 
house of a foreigner, without authority, and not in the presence of the 
consul of the nation.       I have now been here four-and-twenty hours, and
am assured that my liberation will have been effectuated before another day
shall have passed over.       My fellow-prisoners have treated me with 
unbounded kindness and hospitality, and I have never found myself amongst 
more quiet and well-behaved men.       Yet       what is their 
history?       The handsome black-haired man who is now looking over my 
shoulder is the celebrated thief Palacio, the most expert housebreaker and 
dexterous swindler in Spain       in a word, the modern Guzman 
Dalfarache.       The brawny man who sits by the brasero of charcoal
is Salvador, the highwayman of Ronda, who has committed a hundred 
murders.       A fashionably dressed man, short and slight in person, is 
walking about the room: he wears immense whiskers and mustachios; he is one
of that most singular race the Jews of Spain; he is imprisoned for 
counterfeiting money.       He is an atheist, but like a true Jew the name 
which he most hates is that of Christ.       Yet he is so quiet and civil, 
and they are all so quiet and civil, and it is that which most horrifies 
me, for quietness and civility in them seem so unnatural.
Novr. 26th.       Since writing the above, I have been set at 
liberty.       I am going to Madrid in a few hours to demand redress, and 
to make preparations for leaving Spain as soon as possible.       There is 
nothing more to be done here for the present in the cause of the 
Gospel.       I received your letter, which I read with great 
pleasure.       You are quite right in most of your observations, and 
especially in one.       That circular was uncalled for.
Ever yours,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Jan. 3, 1840.)
Decr. 24, 1839,
Madrid, No. 16 Calle 
Santiago.
Rev. and dear Sir,       The last letter 
which I wrote to you was from Seville, and in that I gave you an account of
what I had been doing for some time previous and likewise of my 
imprisonment.       I have now been in Madrid nearly three weeks, and 
immediately after my arrival I demanded redress of the Spanish Government 
for the various outrages which I have recently been subjected to at 
Seville.       Mr. Aston, the British Minister, not having yet arrived at 
Madrid, I presented my complaint through Mr. Jerningham the first secretary
of Legation, who has superseded Mr. Southern, the latter gentleman having 
been appointed to Lisbon.       Mr. Southern introduced me to Mr. 
Jerningham, who received me with great kindness and took up my cause very 
warmly.       Whether I shall be able to obtain justice I know not, for I 
have against me the Canons of Seville; and all the arts of villainy which 
they are so accustomed to practise will of course be used against me for 
the purpose of screening the ruffian who is their instrument.       An 
instance which I am about to give will speak volumes as to this 
person       s character.       When I was in prison, he forced his way 
into my house and searched it for Testaments, but found none.       When he
was questioned by the vice-consul as to the authority by which he made this
search, he pulled out a paper purporting to be the deposition of an old 
woman to the effect that I had sold her a Testament some ten days 
before.       This document was a forgery.       I had never seen the 
female in question, and during the whole time that I have been in Andalusia
I have never sold a book of any description to any such person.
I have been, my dear Sir, fighting with wild beasts during the greatest 
part of the time which has elapsed since I had last the pleasure of seeing 
you.       None but myself can have an idea of what I have undergone and 
the difficulties which I have had to encounter; but I wish not to dilate on
that subject.       Thanks be to the Most High that my labours are now 
brought to a conclusion.       The Madrid edition of the New Testament has 
been distributed, with the exception of a few hundred copies, which I have 
no wish should be sold at present, for reasons stated on a prior occasion, 
and which I shall endeavour to leave in safe custody.       The fate of 
this edition has been a singular one, by far the greatest part having been 
dispersed among the peasantry of Spain and the remainder amongst the very 
poor of the towns, the artisans of Madrid and Seville, the water-carriers 
and porters.       You will rarely find a copy of this work in the houses 
of the wealthy and respectable, but you will frequently light upon it in 
the huts of the labourers, in the garrets or cellars of the penniless, and 
even in the hulks and convict-garrisons (presidios).       I myself 
saw it in the prison of Seville.       As for the few copies of the entire 
Bible which I had at my disposal, they have been distributed amongst the 
upper classes, chiefly amongst the mercantile body, the members of which 
upon the whole are by far the most intellectual and best educated of the 
subjects of the Spanish monarchy.
I have thus cast my books upon the waters.       It is for the Lord on 
high to determine the quantity of good which they are to operate.       I 
have a humble hope however that they will be permitted to do some.       If
the eyes of only a few of these unhappy people amongst whom I am still 
sojourning be through them opened to one of the damning errors of popery, I
shall esteem myself amply remunerated for all the pain, the anxiety, and I 
may almost say misery (for the flesh is weak) which I have experienced in 
the work, even for that       to me, the most heart-breaking of 
everything       the strange, the disadvantageous light in which, I am 
aware, I must frequently have appeared to those I most respect and 
love.       My situation throughout has been a most peculiar one, rocks and
quicksands have surrounded me on every side, and frequently I have been 
compelled to give offence to my friends in order not to afford a triumph to
the enemies of God and His cause.
In your last kind communication, I think, you said that neither our 
excellent friend Mr. B. [Brackenbury] nor myself appeared properly to 
appreciate the worth of two other of our friends who had been labouring in 
Spain.       Permit me here to observe that we both appreciate their 
sterling worth of character and piety; they are both very extraordinary 
individuals, one particularly so, and the zeal which both have displayed in
a holy cause is quite above praise.       But it is necessary in order to 
accomplish much good in a country situated as this is at present, that the 
greatest prudence and foresight go hand in hand with zeal and piety.       
A corrupt Government, influenced by an atrocious priesthood, has for the 
last three years been on the look-out to take advantage of every rash 
movement of the helpers in God       s cause in Spain.       It ought 
always to be borne in mind that though nominally a constitutional country, 
Spain is governed by despotism the more infamous and dangerous as it decks 
itself in the garb of liberty.       Whenever a native becomes obnoxious to
the Government, he is instantly seized and imprisoned, though perhaps 
guilty of no crime which can be punished by law; foreigners have by law 
particular privileges, but these privileges are every day violated, and 
redress is seldom or never obtained; which proves that the law is a dead 
letter.
I know perfectly well that it is no infraction of the law to 
print or sell the Holy Scriptures, either with or without comment, in 
Spain.       What then?       Is there not such a thing as A Royal 
Ordinance to the effect that the Scriptures be seized wherever they are
found?       True it is that ordinance is an unlawful one: but what matters
that, provided it be put into execution by the authorities civil and 
military?       Too many Englishmen who visit Spain imagine that they carry
their own highly favoured country at their back, a country in which the law
rules supreme; but let them once be brought into collision with the 
Government, and they will soon learn how little it avails them to have 
right on their side whilst brute force is always at the call of their 
adversaries.
I have informed Mr. Jerningham that for some time past I have 
relinquished distributing the Scriptures in Spain       which is the 
truth.       I therefore claim the privileges of a British subject and the 
protection of my Government.       I shall return to England as soon as I 
can obtain some redress for this affair.       It is then my intention to 
attempt to obtain an interview with some of the members of the House of 
Lords.       I have important disclosures to make respecting the system of 
persecution which still exists in this country with respect to Protestants,
who are not only debarred the exercise of their religion but to whom the 
common privilege of burial is denied: so much for the tolerance of 
Popery.       Yet there are journals of talent and learning in England who,
observing that British Protestants, alarmed at the progress which the Papal
doctrine is making in the British islands, are concerting measures for 
their own defence, accuse them of raising once more the senseless bray 
against Popery; as if every unprejudiced person was not aware that 
Popery is an unrelenting fiend which never spares when it has the power to 
crush       and that power I am afraid it will soon possess in Britain, 
unless the poor down-trodden Protestants stand back to back and combat the 
monster to the death.       This is no vain alarm, I assure you; therefore 
I beg that you will not smile.       Few people know more of the secrets of
Popery than myself, or the stand which she intends to take when time and 
place serve.       Therefore in conclusion let me entreat those of our 
friends who may hear these lines read to be on their guard, to drop all 
petty dissensions, and to comport themselves like brothers.       
Protestants must no longer be disunited.
I will write again in a day or two.
May the Lord be with you, Revd. and dear Sir.
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Jan. 7, 1840)
Madrid, No. 16 Calle,
Santiago,
28th Dec. 1839.
Revd. and dear Sir,       I lose not a moment
in writing to you in consequence of an article in one of the London papers 
(the Courier, I believe) which has just been shown me.       It 
relates to my late imprisonment at Seville, and contains part of a letter 
which I showed to a friend and which indeed was a copy of that which I sent
to yourself.       With respect to the letter I have little to observe, 
save that I showed it to various individuals (who took copies) in order 
that an incorrect account of the affair might not get abroad; but I beg 
leave solemnly to assure you that I disavow and give no countenance to any 
remarks or observations respecting it which may find their way into 
print.       I am not ashamed of the Methodists of Cadiz; their 
conduct in many respects does them honour, nor do I accuse any one of 
fanaticism amongst our dear and worthy friends; but I cannot answer for the
tittle-tattle of Madrid.       Far be it from me to reflect upon any one: I
am but too well aware of my own multitudinous imperfections and 
follies.       I am going instantly to write to Mr. Rule, and I would also 
to our other friend did I but know his address.       Should you have an 
opportunity of communicating with him, pray, pray say something on the 
subject, and present to him my kind love.       I hope sincerely no further
notice will be taken of this affair in the newspapers, but to attempt to 
correct their errors would merely make bad worse.       Pray excuse my 
agitation, but I write in haste.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, yours sincerely,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. Jan. 13, 1840)
Madrid, No. 16 Calle 
Santiago,
2 January 1840.
Revd. and dear Sir,       To-morrow I depart 
in order to return to Seville.       I have laid a full account of the late
outrageous assault before the British Embassy, and a strong representation 
has been made to the Spanish Government.       I have now nothing further 
to detain me in the Spanish capital, and I hope that within a very short 
time I shall be able to bid adieu to the shores of Spain, which I shall 
quit with as little regret as the tired labourer at nightfall quits the 
filthy ditch in which he has been toiling during the whole of a dreary 
day.
I should feel much obliged if you would write me a line or two, directed
to my usual address, No. 7 Plazuela de la Pila Seca, Sevilla, with any 
little information respecting matters of serious import, as I am almost 
entirely unacquainted with what has been going on during the last six 
months, the public journals containing little which has any interest for 
me.       Is it possible that the British Government is going to bombard 
the coast of China because the Emperor of that country is not disposed to 
countenance opium smuggling?       I have frequently difficulty in 
believing my eyes when I read of the proceedings of Christians and people 
high in authority, whom it is of course my wish and duty to respect.       
Is it wonderful that the Chinese cling to Buddh and refuse to confess the 
Son of the Eternal, when they see the professors of the Christian religion 
commit such acts of cruel violence and flagrant injustice?
I have drawn for twenty pounds, which will liquidate the expenses of the
journey from Seville and back again.       I shall require no more until my
departure for England.       In the meanwhile I am preparing my accounts 
and various other papers.       Pray present my best remembrances to all my
friends.       If there be anything which I can perform for any of them 
before I leave Spain, let them but inform me and it shall be done.
I remain, Revd. and dear Sir, ever yours,
George Borrow.
To the Rev. A. Brandram
(Endorsed: recd. March 31st, 1840) br 
/>
Seville, March 18, 1840.
Revd. and dear Sir,       Last night I 
received a letter from my worthy friend Mr. Brackenbury, in which he 
informed me that he had received a communication from Mr. Jackson stating 
that since my departure from Madrid the Society had heard nothing from me 
and that it was anxious on my account.       This intelligence astonished 
me; as towards the end of January and beginning of February I wrote two 
letters, one to yourself and the other to Mr. Hitchin.       From yourself 
I had expected an answer, and your silence made me very, very 
unhappy.       For upwards of five months I have not heard a word from 
England, though during that period I have written twelve letters, of which 
seven were to the Bible Society.
I did not return to England immediately after my departure from Madrid, 
for several reasons.       First, there was my affair with the 
Alcalde still pending; second, I wished to get my papers into some 
order; third, I wished to effect a little more in the cause, though not in 
the way of distribution as I had no books; moreover the house in which I 
resided was paid for, and I was unwilling altogether to lose the money; I 
likewise dreaded an English winter, for I have lately been subjected to 
attacks, whether of gout or rheumatism I know not, which I believe were 
brought on by sitting, standing and sleeping in damp places during my 
wanderings in Spain.       The Alcalde has lately been turned out of
his situation, but I believe more on account of his being a Carlist than 
for his behaviour to me; that however, is of little consequence, as I have 
long forgotten the affair.       I have again been in trouble; and the 
Government and clergy seem determined on persecuting me until I leave 
Spain.       I embark on the third of next month, and you will probably see
me by the sixteenth.       I wish very much to spend the remaining years of
my life in the northern parts of China, as I think I have a call to those 
regions, and shall endeavour by every honourable means to effect my 
purpose.       I have a work nearly in readiness for publication, and two 
others in a state of forwardness.       The title of the first I take the 
liberty of sending you on the other side.       I hope yet to die in the 
cause of my Redeemer.
I have at present nothing further to say of importance.
I therefore remain, as usual, Revd. and dear Sir, most sincerely 
yours,
G. B.
P.S.       What an admirable man and Christian is Mr. 
Brackenbury!

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
