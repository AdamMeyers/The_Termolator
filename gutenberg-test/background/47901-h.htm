<p class="chaptitle">CAPTURING AN AIR-SHIP.</p>


<p>"Py shiminy grickets! Vat do you t'ink oof dot! See
dere vonce, Matt. A palloon, or I vas a lopsder! Und
vat a funny palloon it iss."</p>

<p>Motor Matt and his Dutch chum, Carl Pretzel, were
sitting by a quiet country roadside, in the shade of some
trees. Drawn up near them was a light touring-car.</p>

<p>The boys were several miles out of the city of Chicago,
from which place they had started about the middle of
the forenoon, and they had halted in that shady spot between
Hammond and Hegewisch to eat the lunch they
had brought with them. Carl had just finished the last
piece of fried chicken when, happening to look skyward,
he saw something that brought him to his feet with a
jump. As he called to his chum, he pointed with the
"drum-stick," at which he had been nibbling.</p>

<p>Matt's surprise was nearly as great as Carl's, and he
likewise sprang up and gazed at the air-ship, which was
coming toward them from the north and east, making
smart headway against the wind.</p>

<p>"Great spark-plugs!" exclaimed Matt. "That's the
first air-ship I ever saw."</p>

<p>"Vat's der tifference bedween a palloon und a air-ship?"
asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Well, you can navigate an air-ship with the wind or
against it, while a balloon is at the mercy of every current
that blows. A round gas-bag and a basket is a
balloon, Carl, but when you add a gasolene-motor and
a propeller you have an air-ship."</p>

<p>"Dot's blain enough. Der air-ship iss sky-hootin' dis
vay to peat four oof a kindt. Say, it looks like a pig
cigar. Vat a funny pitzness! Und you nefer seen vone
pefore, Matt?"</p>

<p>"I never saw one that would travel successfully. This
one, though, seems to be going in good shape."</p>

<p>"You haf seen palloons meppy?"</p>

<p>"More than I can count," said he. "I've been up in
balloons a dozen times. When I was in the Berkshire
Hills they used to have races, and start from Pittsfield.
That's where I began making ascensions."</p>

<p>Carl dropped his wondering eyes to Matt for a moment.</p>

<p>"You vas der plamedest feller!" he exclaimed. "You
haf tone more t'ings as any feller I ever see, und you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
nefer say nodding ondil it shlips oudt, like vat it toes
now."</p>

<p>Motor Matt made no answer to this. Just then his
attention was completely absorbed by the air-craft.</p>

<p>As near as he could judge, the cigar-shaped gas-bag
was more than a hundred feet long. Beneath the bag
was suspended a light framework. Midway of the framework
was an open space, containing a chair in which sat
the man who was handling the motor. Out behind the
driver the framework tapered to a point, and at the end
of this rearmost point was the whirling propeller. The
glittering blades caught the sun in a continuous sparkling
reflection, which made the air-ship appear to be trailed
by a glow of fire.</p>

<p>Forward of the cockpit, or open space, was the motor.
A rail ran around the cockpit.</p>

<p>There were two men in the car&mdash;the one in the driver's
seat and another in front of him, leaning over the rail.
This second man seemed to be looking at the two boys,
and to be waving his hand and giving directions to the
driver.</p>

<p>Along the side of the gas-bag Matt was able to read
the name "Hawk," printed in large letters.</p>

<p>The Hawk was about a hundred feet above the surface
of the earth. A long rope depended from the car, and
twenty or thirty feet of it dragged along the ground as
the car moved.</p>

<p>"Vat's der rope for, Matt?" inquired Carl.</p>

<p>"If that was an ordinary balloon," replied Matt, "we'd
call the rope a guide-rope. Usually the guide-rope helps
to save gas and ballast. When you want a balloon to
go up, you know, you throw out sand; when you want
it to come down, you let out gas. That trailing rope
acts as ballast. When the gas expands, and the ship
wants to rise, part of the rope that trails is lifted from
the ground and throws more weight on the car; and
when the gas contracts, and the car shows a tendency
to descend, more of the rope falls on the ground and
takes just that much weight off the car."</p>

<p>"Dot's as clear as mud!"</p>

<p>"I can't understand why they've got a drag on the air-ship,"
muttered Matt. "I supposed the propeller and the
steering-blades were enough to send such a craft wherever
it was wanted to go."</p>

<p>As the Hawk came nearer, Matt's trained eyes and
ears convinced him that the driver of the air-ship was
a poor motorist. Evidently he did not understand the
engine he was handling. The air-ship zigzagged erratically
on its course, and the long bag ducked upward
and downward in a most hair-raising manner. On top
of that, Matt could hear one of the cylinders misfiring.</p>

<p>The Hawk's drag-rope was trailing along the roadway.
First it was on one side of the road, and then on the
other, following the irregular swaying and plunging of
the car.</p>

<p>"Come on, Carl!" called Matt, turning and running for
the automobile. "If that rope strikes our car it may
damage it. We've got to fend it off."</p>

<p>"Dose air-ship fellers vas mighdy careless!" answered
Carl, hurrying after his chum. "Dot rope mighdt knock
town fences, und preak vinders, und do plendy more
tamages."</p>

<p>"There isn't power enough at the other end of it to do
much damage," Matt answered, posting himself at the
rear of the automobile and watching the advancing rope
with sharp eyes.</p>

<p>By that time the Hawk was almost over the boys'
heads. The rope, of course, was dragging far out behind,
and the trailing part of it bid fair to pass the car
well on the right.</p>

<p>"Hello, there!" shouted the man at the rail of the
Hawk, leaning far over and making a trumpet out of his
hands.</p>

<p>He seemed to be excited, for some cause or other.</p>

<p>"Hello yourseluf, vonce!" called back the Dutch boy.
"Keep a leedle off mit your rope&mdash;ve don'd vand it to
make some drouples for us."</p>

<p>"The air-ship's out of control," the man shouted. "We
can't stop the motor and the ship's running away! Grab
the rope, hitch it to your automobile and tow us back
to South Chicago. We'll give you a hundred dollars for
your trouble. Be quick!"</p>

<p>"I like his nerf, I don't t'ink!" growled Carl. "He
vants to run off mit us und der pubble, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can tow the air-ship, all right," cried Matt, "providing
we can get the rope fast to the automobile. We'll
have to take a half hitch with the trailing end of the
rope around a tree, and bring the air-ship to a stop."</p>

<p>Matt started for the rope. As he bent down to lay
hold of it, the car gave a lurch sideways and the rope
was whisked out of his hands and was thrown directly
against Carl's feet.</p>

<p>Carl grabbed it. At the same moment the air-ship
took an upward leap, on account of the weight which
Carl had taken off the car. This leap flung Carl into
the air. He turned a frog-like somersault, hands and
feet sprawled out, and came down with a thump, flat
on his back.</p>

<p>"Whoosh!" he yelled, a good deal more startled than
hurt, sitting up on the grass and shaking his fist at the
bobbing craft overhead, "you dit dot on burpose! Vat's
der madder mit you, anyvay? Vat for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl forgot his fancied grievance watching Motor
Matt. The latter, making another leap at the rope as it
settled back again after overturning Carl, succeeded in
laying hold of it.</p>

<p>He had the rope by the end, so that when he picked
it up none of the weight was taken from the ship, and
Carl's disastrous exploit was not repeated.</p>

<p>"Wrap it around a tree!" yelled the man at the air-ship's
rail; "take a half-hitch around a tree!"</p>

<p>The man might just as well have saved his breath.
That had been Motor Matt's plan, all along, and even as
the aeronaut was shouting his instructions Matt was
jumping for the nearest tree.</p>

<p>The young motorist had little time to make the rope
fast. The whirling propeller was driving the Hawk onward
against the wind at a fair rate of speed. Had
there been no opposing wind, Matt would not have had
time enough for the work ahead of him.</p>

<p>"Come on, Carl!" he shouted.</p>

<p>The Dutch boy stopped watching and made haste to
lend a hand.</p>

<p>Matt was already at the trunk of the tree, but the
rope had traveled onward so rapidly that he had less
than a yard of it in his hands to work with.</p>

<p>Throwing himself on the opposite side of the tree,
Matt laid back on the end of the rope. At that moment
Carl reached his side, dropped near him and likewise
took a grip on the free end of the drag.</p>

<p>"It's der fairst time," panted Carl, "dot I efer heluped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
make some captures mit an air-ship. Shinks! Look at
dot, vonce!"</p>

<p>The driving propeller had forced the Hawk to the
end of its leash. The boys, with only a half wrap of
the rope around the trunk, felt the quick pull, but easily
controlled it. The pull was steady, but, inch by inch,
they worked more and more of the rope around the
trunk until there was enough to make a knot.</p>

<p>"Dot's der dicket!" exulted Carl, scrambling erect.
"Ve've got her tied like a pird mit vone foot. Now
how ve going to ged her hitched ondo der car?"</p>

<p>"We'll have to find out what's the matter with the
motor, up there," answered Matt, "and see if the power
can't be shut off."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he got to his feet and walked down the
road to a point directly under the air-ship.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A QUEER "FIND."</p>


<p>Both passengers in the air-ship were now leaning over
the rail of the suspended car.</p>

<p>"Hitch us on to your automobile," shouted the one
who had been doing the driving, "and tow us back to
South Chicago."</p>

<p>The offhand way in which the man spoke proved that
he was lacking on the practicable side of his nature.</p>

<p>"That's a whole lot easier said than done," Matt called
back. "It was only by a happenchance that we got your
drag-rope tied to the tree. If you've got an anchor-rope
up there, throw it down and we'll make it fast to the
car before we cast off the other."</p>

<p>"That's the only long rope we've got," answered the
man.</p>

<p>"Well," went on Matt, "you ought to be able to see
what sort of a job we're up against. Your motor is
pulling hard on the rope, and the moment we take the
rope from the tree it will be jerked out of our hands.
Don't you know how to run a gas-engine?"</p>

<p>"I know how to start a gas-engine," was the amazing
response, "but I don't know how to stop it."</p>

<p>"Py shiminy grickets!" whooped Carl, "you vas a nice
pair to shtart off mit a gasolene-air-ship. You vas in
luck nod to make some landings on Chupiter, Mars or
to hit a comic."</p>

<p>Matt likewise thought it was an odd situation, but believed
it would be well to get the two helpless aeronauts
down on terra firma before asking for an explanation of
their predicament.</p>

<p>"Do either of you know what the gasolene-tank is?"
he asked.</p>

<p>The heads disappeared within the car for a moment,
then one reappeared over the railing.</p>

<p>"Yes, we've found that, all right," said the man.</p>

<p>"And the carburettor&mdash;do you know where to look for
that?"</p>

<p>"Is that the thing that makes the spark?"</p>

<p>Carl let off a howl of derision.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber, vat a ignorance! Der carpuretter
makes der gas, dot makes der exblosions in der cylinter,
dot moofs der biston dot makes der bropellor go 'roundt.
I know dot meinseluf, efen dough I vasn't so pright like
Modor Matt."</p>

<p>"There's a pipe leading from the gasolene-tank to the
carburettor," continued Matt, "and there's a valve which
should be worked by a lever. Close that valve and you'll
shut off the supply of gasolene. When you do that, the
motor will stop, and we can work down here to better
advantage."</p>

<p>The head disappeared again and the car rocked and
swayed as the two men scrambled around in it. Their
ignorance, however, increased rather than lessened the
difficulty. The misfiring of the one cylinder ceased and
the motor took up its humming rhythm at an even faster
speed. The fresh impetus of the propeller put a harder
pull on the rope, and the strain bore sudden and unexpected
results.</p>

<p>With a yell of dismay the driver of the machine leaned
over the rail of the car. He had thrown off his hat and
his coat was unbuttoned.</p>

<p>"We're making it worse!" he cried. "I wish to thunder
you could come up here and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then the drag-rope, which could not have been
properly fastened to the car, let go and dropped earthward
in sinuous coils.</p>

<p>The man doubled farther over the rail in a futile and
foolish effort to lay hold of it. Something fell from the
pocket of his coat, fluttered through the air and landed
in the top of a tree.</p>

<p>Matt noted the flight of the fallen object only incidentally,
for the major part of his attention was taken up
with the actions of the car.</p>

<p>The steering rudder had become elevated, and the air-ship
started at a tremendous clip toward the clouds. The
two aeronauts could be seen rushing around the car like
mad. While the two boys watched, the rudder was
brought down to a level; but something else had gone
wrong, for the machine could not be maneuvered.</p>

<p>Swiftly the air-ship diminished to a mere speck in the
southern sky, and then vanished altogether.</p>

<p>Carl turned a blank look at Matt and gave a long
whistle.</p>

<p>"Dot proofs, Matt," said he, "dot id don'd vas goot
pitzness to monkey mit t'ings you don'd know nodding
aboudt. Oof dose fellers run into a shooding shdar
dere vill be some fine smash oops."</p>

<p>"Why they ever ventured up in the air-ship, knowing
so little about how to manage it, is a mystery."</p>

<p>Matt gave his head an ominous shake.</p>

<p>"Vat vill pecome oof dem?" queried Carl.</p>

<p>"If they can get the steering rudder to working, they
can drive the air-ship to the ground. Anyhow, the supply
of gasolene will have to give out, in time, and then
they may be able to come down."</p>

<p>"Dere iss somet'ing crooked aboudt dose fellers. Oddervise,
dey vouldn't be vere dey are."</p>

<p>"Did you see something drop from the driver's pocket,
Carl?"</p>

<p>"Nix. Iss dot vat habbened?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It landed in the top of that tree, over there."</p>

<p>"Meppy ve ged holt oof der t'ing und find oudt somet'ing
aboudt who dose fellers vas, und for vy dey vent
off for a fly mitoudt knowing how to manach der flyer?"</p>

<p>Matt proceeded to the foot of the tree in whose
branches the fallen object had alighted. Lifting his gaze
upward, he peered sharply into the foliage.</p>

<p>"I see it," he announced, pointing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Und me, too," said Carl. "It vas vite, und round,
like a punch oof bapers rolled oop. How ve ged him
down, hey? Meppy ve t'row some shticks ad him?"</p>

<p>Suiting his action to the word, Carl picked up clubs
and stones and hurled them upward in an endeavor to
dislodge the object. Finding that these efforts were unsuccessful,
Matt threw off his coat and hat and climbed
the tree.</p>

<p>The roll of papers was lodged far out in the fork of
a branch. Standing on the branch, he jumped up and
down on it and jarred the roll loose. Carl caught it
deftly as it fell.</p>

<p>"Hoop-a-la!" he yelled; "here she vas, Matt. Come
down a leedle vile ve look him ofer."</p>

<p>In a few moments Matt was again on the ground.
The roll, which Carl immediately handed to him, he
found to contain a number of sheets wrapped compactly
in a piece of white paper.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll open it and not stand on any ceremony,"
said Matt.</p>

<p>"Sure!" exclaimed Carl. "For vy nod?"</p>

<p>"It's not exactly the right thing to do. They're not our
papers and we haven't any business tampering with documents
that belong to some one else. Under the circumstances,
though, and considering that the whole affair of
the air-ship is a strange one, and that we may be able
to help the two men in some way through the information
the roll may contain, we'll have a look at it."</p>

<p>Going back to the place where they had eaten their
lunch, the boys sat down and Matt opened the little bundle.
A dozen blue prints of mechanical tracings were
revealed. In the center of the roll was a sealed envelope,
bearing no address or writing of any sort.</p>

<p>"Dere's nodding aboudt der plue prints to helup us
know somet'ing," said Carl. "Oben der enfellup, Matt."</p>

<p>"No," returned Matt, "we can't do that. That would
be going a little too far."</p>

<p>"Vell, ve got to do somet'ing oof ve findt oudt who
dose fellers vas."</p>

<p>"We'll wait, and give them a chance to claim their
property."</p>

<p>"How dey vas going to glaim it, hey? Dey didtn't
dell us who dey vas, und ve ditn't dell dem our names."</p>

<p>"We know the air-ship came from South Chicago. I
don't believe there are very many air-ships in that place,
and if we inquire around a little we ought to be able to
find out who owns the Hawk."</p>

<p>"Righdt you vas! Somevay, Matt, you always know
vat to do ven eferypody else iss guessing. Shall ve ged
indo der car und go pack to der pig city py vay oof
Sout' Chicago?"</p>

<p>"That's our cue. If we can discover who owns the
Hawk we'll leave these papers there for him."</p>

<p>Matt rolled up the envelope and the papers and stowed
them safely away in his pocket.</p>

<p>"I know dere vas some niggers in der vood-pile, all
righdt," averred Carl. "Two fellers vouldn't go off mit
an air-ship dey don'd know how to run oof eferyt'ing vas
like it ought to be."</p>

<p>"There may be a whole lot of sense in what you say,
Carl," replied Matt, "and then, again, the explanation of
the queer layout may be extremely simple. Don't get to
imagining things, old chap, but coil up that rope and
throw it into the car. We'll carry it back to South Chicago
and leave it at the same place we leave this roll of
blue prints."</p>

<p>While Carl was coiling up the rope, Matt gave his
attention to the automobile. When Carl arrived and
threw the rope into the tonneau, Matt was busy with
the crank.</p>

<p>Presently they were in the car and headed back along
the return course.</p>

<p>Hardly had they got under good headway, however,
when a flurry of dust showed in the road ahead of them.
As the wind blew the dust aside, a horse and buggy with
two men broke into view.</p>

<p>In accordance with the rules of the road, Matt slowed
down to make sure the horse did not take fright at the
automobile. The horse was going at a run, and the men
seemed to be excited.</p>

<p>The one who was driving drew rein as the rig came
alongside the car.</p>

<p>"Say," shouted the men, "did you boys see an air-ship
anywhere in this vicinity?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Matt. "It was going south."</p>

<p>"Then we're on the right track?"</p>

<p>"So far as we know; but the air-ship was unmanageable
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The men in the buggy did not wait to hear any more.
The driver began plying his whip and the horse again
leaped onward.</p>

<p>"Who were those two men?" yelled Matt, anxious for
a little information.</p>

<p>"Thieves!" came the answer, as rig and passengers
once more vanished in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BALLOON HOUSE.</p>


<p>"Yah!" shouted Carl. "Vat I dell you, Matt? I knew
dere vas somet'ing der madder! Dem two fellers vas
t'ieves, und dey haf shtole der air-ship. Py shinks, dey
haf got demselufs indo drouple, und it vas goot enough
for dem. Vat you going to do?"</p>

<p>Matt had begun turning the machine in the road.
When he had pointed it the other way, he started off at
a swift pace on the trail of the two men in the buggy.</p>

<p>"We'll try and overhaul those two fellows," answered
Matt, "and tell them what we know. The information
we've picked up may be valuable to them."</p>

<p>"Dey don't vas endidled to it," averred Carl. "Vy
ditn't dey shtop und ask us somet'ings? Anyvay, how
can dey ketch a flying machine mit a horse und puggy?
You mighdt as vell dry to ketch a sky rocket mit a papy
carriage."</p>

<p>"The Hawk will have to come down," said Matt,
"and if those men are anywhere near it when it hits the
earth they'll be able to recover the machine and catch the
thieves."</p>

<p>"Oof der machine hits der eart' so hardt as vat I t'ink,
it von't be vort' nodding, nor der t'ieves neider."</p>

<p>"There's a chance that the rascals will come down
safely. If those men in the buggy had had their wits
about them, they'd have hitched their rig to the fence
and have jumped into the automobile. We could have
hustled them over the ground four times as fast as they
were going."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>A few moments later the boys reached a place where
the road branched. The horse and buggy were not in
sight along either road.</p>

<p>"Vich vay now?" queried Carl.</p>

<p>"It's all guesswork," answered Matt, "but it's always
a pretty good plan to keep to the right," and, with that,
he drove the car along the right-hand branch.</p>

<p>After five minutes of fast running, they had not overtaken
the rig and it was still not to be seen anywhere
ahead. The boys knew they had been traveling three or
four times as fast as the two men were going, and that,
if they were on the right track, the men should have been
overtaken long before.</p>

<p>Disappointedly, Matt halted the car and turned it in
the other direction.</p>

<p>"No use, Carl," said he. "Those men must have taken
the left-hand fork instead of the right. They're too far
away, now, for us to think of finding them. We'll hike
for South Chicago."</p>

<p>"Dot's der pest t'ing dot ve can do," returned Carl.
"Ve'll find der owner oof der Hawk und gif him der
trag-rope und der bapers."</p>

<p>"We won't find him. He must have been one of those
two men in the buggy. Probably we can find where he
lives, though, and turn the rope and the papers over to
some one who will give them to him."</p>

<p>"Meppy ve pedder take der shtuff to der bolice, hey?
Oof der fellers vas t'ieves, dot enfellup mighdt gif der
bolice a line on dem."</p>

<p>"There's something in that, too," muttered Matt.
"We'll try to find the owner of the Hawk, though, before
we call on the police."</p>

<p>An hour later, the boys came into South Chicago along
a turnpike that passed the rolling mills. A man on a
motor-cycle was just coming out of a fenced enclosure
near one of the mills, and Matt halted him for the purpose
of making a few inquiries. From his looks, the
man was of some consequence in the steel rail plant, and
probably was well-informed as to affairs in South Chicago.</p>

<p>"Do you know of any one around here that has an
air-ship?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>The question was something of a novelty, and the man
laughed as he rested one foot on the ground and balanced
his motor-cycle upright.</p>

<p>"I suppose air-ships will be thicker'n hops, one of these
days," said he, "but just now they're about as seldom as
hen's teeth. I understand there are a couple of men here
who are working at air-ships&mdash;one of them came to the
mills to see if he couldn't get some aluminum castings.
He's got a balloon house about a quarter of a mile down
the road, on the left. Drop in there and maybe you'll
find the man&mdash;and the ship, too."</p>

<p>Matt thanked the man and followed him slowly as he
sputtered off into town.</p>

<p>The balloon house, which was plainly visible from the
road, was a long, high shed, and occupied a solitary position
in the midst of a marshy field. The doors in one end
of the shed, arranged in a series and reaching from
ground to roof peak, were open.</p>

<p>Leaving the automobile at the roadside, the boys
climbed a fence and made their way across the flat
ground to the big house. On reaching the opened doors,
one glance showed them that there was no air-ship in
the shed.</p>

<p>On the earth floor, along one side of the great room,
were two or three work benches and a litter of wood
and metal scraps. There was also, in the farther end of
the chamber, a number of small tanks, presumably used
for the manufacture of hydrogen gas. As the boys stood
in the doorway, two brawny men showed themselves
from behind these tanks. They wore greasy overclothes
and their sleeves were rolled up.</p>

<p>"Get out of here!" yelled one of the men. "We don't
allow any reporters around this shebang."</p>

<p>"We're not reporters," answered Matt, standing his
ground. "Do you keep an air-ship here?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's what this big shed is for."</p>

<p>The two men came closer to the boys, one of them
filling and lighting a cob pipe as he approached.</p>

<p>"Is the name of it the 'Hawk?'" went on Matt.</p>

<p>"Right again," said the man who had been doing the
talking.</p>

<p>His eyes were like gimlets, and bored their way into
Matt through narrow slits.</p>

<p>"Who's the owner of the Hawk?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I'm the owner, and my name's Hector Brady. If
Jerrold has sent you here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know any one by the name of Jerrold. Who
is he, and why should he send me here?"</p>

<p>The sharp little eyes continued to study Matt.</p>

<p>"Before I say anything more," answered Brady, "you'd
better tell me a little about yourself."</p>

<p>"I don't know as that's necessary, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd know how necessary it is if you were inventing
machines and trying to keep your appliances a secret.
I'm not the only man in South Chicago that's perfecting
an air-ship. A fellow named Jerrold has cut into the
same game, and he has some one nosing around here a
good share of the time, trying to get wise to something.
If Jerrold has sent you here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He hasn't," broke in Matt. "I don't know Jerrold
from Adam."</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"King, Matt King."</p>

<p>Brady gave a jump.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you're the young Western
phenomenon the Lestrange people have brought to Chicago
to run in that five-day automobile race that's
turned on at the Coliseum to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I'm one of their racers," answered Matt. "They have
four more in the race besides me."</p>

<p>"Well, by thunder!" Brady stood off and regarded
Matt as though he was a natural curiosity. "Why, you're
no more than a kid! They had your picture in the
paper, after that Kansas race, but you're a heap younger
than I thought. I guess you've forgotten more about
gasolene-motors than a whole lot of people ever knew."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't so bad as that. I came here to do you a
good turn, Mr. Brady, and I can't see the sense of raking
up my past history. Your air-ship has been stolen, hasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Stolen?" Brady gave another startled jump. "Not
that anybody knows of. Why? What put that in your
head?"</p>

<p>Matt was "stumped." He looked blankly at Carl and
found that Carl had turned an equally blank look at him.</p>

<p>"Where is the Hawk now?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"She went out on a trial spin with three men in the
car. Expect her back any moment."</p>

<p>There was a shifty look in Brady's face, and he spoke
in a fashion that aroused Matt's suspicions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then the Hawk wasn't stolen and you didn't send
two men with a horse and buggy to look for her?"
queried Matt. "We saw the air-ship, but there were
only a couple of men in the car and the machine was out
of control. We tried to stop the craft by means of the
drag-rope, but the rope broke loose and the Hawk got
away. One of the men on board dropped a roll of papers
out of his coat-pocket and we picked it up."</p>

<p>Brady looked at the other man. The glances they
exchanged were significant, and both swore softly.</p>

<p>"Here's a purty kettle o' fish!" growled the fellow
with the pipe. "What dy'ye s'pose has happened,
Brady?"</p>

<p>Brady muttered something unintelligible, and whirled
to Matt with a scowl.</p>

<p>"That roll of papers belongs to me," said he. "Just
pass 'em over, King."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I ought to give them to you,
Mr. Brady, or to the police," answered Matt, making no
move to take the roll from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Police!" exclaimed Brady. "What the blazes are you
talking about? The fellow on that car was working for
me, and the papers belong to me."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to be able to identify the roll," proceeded
Matt, coolly. "What did it contain, Mr. Brady?"</p>

<p>"Just papers."</p>

<p>"Typewritten-papers?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, some of them were typewritten."</p>

<p>"How were they tied up? In a piece of yellow paper?"</p>

<p>"That's it. Hand 'em over. It's queer they got lost
out of the car in that way, but mighty lucky you picked
'em up."</p>

<p>"I guess you're thinking of the wrong roll," said
Matt, coolly. "The one you've described isn't the one
we found."</p>

<p>"Whether the description is right or wrong, the papers
are mine, and I'll have 'em!"</p>

<p>Brady, in sudden temper, hurled himself at Matt. The
other man, taking his cue from Brady, jumped for Carl
and grabbed him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Hoop-e-la!" tuned up Carl. "Be jeerful, eferypody!
Here's somet-ing vat ve ditn't oxbect!" And, with that,
the Dutch boy began struggling and using his fists.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE KETTLE CONTINUES TO BOIL.</p>


<p>Both Matt and Carl were well skilled in the art of
self-defense. Matt, perhaps, was a shade more adept in
the use of his fists. Neither of the lads, however, had
been looking for violence, and the sudden attack of
Brady and the other man had taken them by surprise.</p>

<p>The two men had plenty of muscle, and Brady was
desperately determined to secure the roll of papers. The
very fact that he was using force to accomplish his designs
proved that he was not entitled to the papers. For
that reason, Matt was determined to keep them away
from him at all costs.</p>

<p>"Hold the Dutchman, Pete!" puffed Brady, hanging
to the collar of Matt's leather coat and trying to get one
hand into the inside pocket.</p>

<p>"Quiet, Dutchy," threatened Pete, as he and Carl
swung back and forth across the big shed. "I'll strangle
ye if ye ain't peaceable. Ye ain't got no sense, roughin'
things up like&mdash;wow!"</p>

<p>At that instant, Carl landed a telling blow on the point
of Pete's chin. A bushel of shooting-stars must have
danced in front of Pete's eyes, for the jolt hurled him
backward and caused him to claw the air in an attempt
to keep his balance. He was not more than an instant
getting the whip-hand of himself, and when he came out
of his brief daze he was as mad as a hornet.</p>

<p>"I'll kill ye for that!" he yelled, and picked up a heavy
hammer that lay on the floor.</p>

<p>Pete was between Carl and the open end of the shed;
he was likewise between Carl and Matt and Brady. The
struggle had carried Pete and the Dutch boy down
toward the middle of the balloon house.</p>

<p>Matt, out of the tails of his eyes, saw the dangerous
position in which Pete's temper was placing Carl. The
young motorist had been successfully fending off the attempt
of Brady to get into his coat pocket; now, thinking
Carl might need him, he undertook more aggressive
measures.</p>

<p>An empty box, which had evidently been used as a
seat, stood just within the big door. With a sudden
lurch, Matt heaved himself against Brady and knocked
him backward over the box.</p>

<p>As Brady felt himself falling, the instinct to save himself
caused him to let go of Matt. The instant the young
motorist found himself with the free use of his fists, he
let drive at Brady and still further helped him over the
box.</p>

<p>With a roar of anger, Brady doubled up on the floor.
Matt whirled and darted for Pete, reaching that scoundrel
just in time to catch the arm that was whirling the
heavy hammer.</p>

<p>The hammer was wrenched away, and Matt cast it
against the wall of the balloon house.</p>

<p>"Cut for it, Carl!" cried Matt. "Run for the road!"</p>

<p>"You bed my life!" wheezed Carl. "Dis blace don'd
vas gedding fery comfordable."</p>

<p>Brady was picking himself up from the floor as the
boys rushed past with Pete in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>"Get those papers!" yelled Brady.</p>

<p>"I'll git that Dutch kid if it costs me my life!"
whooped Pete.</p>

<p>Brady rushed after Pete, and there was a chase across
the marshy meadow toward the road.</p>

<p>Carl was chunky of build and not nearly so good in a
sprint as was Matt. Matt was in the lead on the rush
from the balloon house, but, anticipating that Carl might
have further trouble with Pete, he slackened his pace.</p>

<p>It was well that he did so. Pete was steadily gaining
on Carl and would undoubtedly have overtaken him had
Matt not executed a quick move with an empty salt barrel
that lay in the line of flight.</p>

<p>At the right moment, Matt rolled the salt barrel in
front of the enraged Pete. Pete's shins slammed against
it, then he dropped on it and plowed up the mucky soil
with the top of his head.</p>

<p>So far as the set-to was concerned, it was settled right
there, Brady being so far in the rear that the boys were
able to clear the fence and get into the automobile before
he could come anywhere near them. As a matter of fact,
Brady gave up the fight as soon as he had witnessed
Pete's mishap with the barrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>As the two chums glided away toward the more thickly
settled part of South Chicago, they could look back and
see Brady assisting the disgruntled Pete to an erect position.
The barrel had been smashed, and Brady was
scraping the mud off Pete with one of the staves.</p>

<p>"How you like dot, hey?" gloried Carl, standing up in
the automobile and shaking his fist. "You vill know pedder
der next time dan to make some foolishness mit
Modor Matt und his bard. Yah, yah, yah!"</p>

<p>Carl wanted to be as tantalizing as he could, but the
automobile was getting too far away. Sinking down in
the seat beside Matt, the Dutch boy chuckled blithely.</p>

<p>"Dis has peen a pooty fine leedle trip, Matt," he observed,
"und has peen full oop mit oxcidement oof a
nofel kindt, yah, so helup me. Dot's vat I like. I'll bed
my life dose fellers t'ink dey vas fell on mit a brick
house. Vat's der madder mit Prady, anyvays?"</p>

<p>"There's something queer about that air-ship affair,"
answered Matt, thoughtfully. "The two men who rode
past us in that buggy said the pair in the car were
thieves, but Brady didn't know anything about the
Hawk's being stolen. Brady said, too, that there ought
to have been three men in the car instead of two. The
one who was missing may have been the driver. That
would account for the poor work the other two were
making with the engine."</p>

<p>"Ve can make some guesses," said Carl, shaking his
head, "aber ve don'd know nodding. Dot roll oof bapers
don'd pelong to Prady. Vell, oof dot's der gase, whose
bapers vas dey?"</p>

<p>"That's a conundrum."</p>

<p>"Vill you dake dem py der bolice?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking of that, and I believe I'll talk with
Mr. Harkrider before I do anything more. He'll tell us
just what to do, and I'm sure his advice will be good.
You see, Carl, we're not entitled to the papers any more
than Brady is, when you come to figure the thing down
to a fine point. If the fellow who lost them out of the
car turned up and claimed them, we'd have to give them
to him."</p>

<p>Mr. Harkrider was superintendent for the Lestrange
Manufacturing Company, the Eastern representatives of
the Jarrot Automobile Company of St. Louis. Following
the Borden cup race, in Kansas, Matt had entered the
services of the Jarrot people, and they had sent him to
Chicago to take part in the five-day race at the Coliseum.
While waiting for the race to start, Matt and Carl had
had the use of any machine they wanted in the Lestrange
garage, so they had put in their time riding around the
city and out into the suburbs. That is how they happened
to be on the road beyond South Chicago at the
time the Hawk was running away with the two aeronauts.</p>

<p>Unusual experiences always seemed to gravitate toward
Matt, and this air-ship affair was one of the most novel
that had ever come his way. What it was leading up to,
he did not know, but it was evident there was a whole
lot more to the matter than appeared on the surface.</p>

<p>After a quick and uneventful run into Chicago, Matt
drove the automobile into the Lestrange garage and
asked for Mr. Harkrider. To his disappointment, Mr.
Harkrider had left for the day and would not return to
the garage until the following morning.</p>

<p>"Well," said Matt, as he and Carl left the garage and
proceeded toward their boarding house, "I guess the delay
won't make much difference. I'll be busy with the
race to-morrow, but you can take the papers, Carl, and
do with them whatever Mr. Harkrider advises."</p>

<p>It was nearly supper time, and after the boys had had
a wash, and a good meal, they went up to their room.</p>

<p>Close to eight o'clock, just as they were getting ready
for bed, a rap fell on the door. Matt answered the summons
and found a boy with a telegram.</p>

<p>The young motorist had been receiving a great many
telegrams, since his Kansas victory, and supposed the
message must be from some motor-car manufacturer
who wanted to secure his services.</p>

<p>But he was destined to a surprise.</p>

<p>The telegram had been sent to the Lestrange garage,
and by the foreman there forwarded to the boarding
place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Matt King</span>, Care Lestrange Company, Chicago:</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>"More aboudt dot air-ship pitzness," muttered Carl.
"Who vas dot Jerrold feller?"</p>

<p>"He must be the man that Brady told us about," said
Matt. "Jerrold seems to be a rival of Brady's, in this
air-ship matter, and the message looks like a good clue.
It won't do any harm to follow it up, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Dere iss somet'ing about dot vat I don'd like," demurred
Carl. "I got some hunches dere iss underhandt
vork afoot."</p>

<p>"I know there's underhand work going on," said Matt,
"but we've been rung in on the deal and have got to
see it through. I'm curious to learn more about the
affair."</p>

<p>"Meppy dot same curiosidy vill make you some
drouples," suggested Carl. "You can't haf dot, ven der
racing iss on do-morrow."</p>

<p>"The Jarrot people have several good men in the five-day
race, so it won't make much difference if I'm not one
of the drivers. Anyhow, I don't intend to be all day in
South Chicago."</p>

<p>"It don'd look righdt for you to go pack dere alone,"
grumbled Carl. "I vouldn't be easy a minid."</p>

<p>"I am not going alone," laughed Matt. "You're going
along, Carl."</p>

<p>The Dutch boy brightened at once and had no more
objections to offer.</p>

<p>"Ach, dot's tifferent! Ve vill shdart ad vonce. How
ve go? On a pubble?"</p>

<p>"No, we'll take a railroad train. I don't want to go
fooling with a car at this time of night."</p>

<p>"Is dere a train ve can ketch?"</p>

<p>"Lots of them. South Chicago is a suburb, and we
can leave here every half hour. We ought to be back
by midnight."</p>

<p>Without debating the matter further, the boys started
forthwith.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">2109 HOYNE STREET.</p>


<p>Hoyne Street was easily found. A number of blast
furnaces stood so near the house the two chums were
looking for that the flames from their tall chimneys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
lighted up the surroundings so brilliantly that they were
able to read the number over the door.</p>

<p>The house was a two-story frame structure. The gas
and smoke from the neighboring iron mills had shriveled
and scorched everything in that part of the town. Even
by night, and under the glow of the furnaces, Hoyne
Street had a dismal and dreary appearance.</p>

<p>No. 2109 was set well back from the sidewalk. Two
branching wings, in front, made the house look like a
deserted manufacturing plant. This impression was
heightened by several broken windows.</p>

<p>There were no lights in the windows other than the
reflected glare from the high chimneys.</p>

<p>"Whoosh!" muttered Carl, as he and Matt came close
to the front of the house and read the number. "Dot's
der blace, Matt, aber it don'd look pooty goot to me.
Der feller vat lifs dere don'd got enough money, I bed
you, to pay for sending dot delegram. Der hen oof
drouple iss aboudt to hatch somet'ing."</p>

<p>"It may be," answered Matt, who likewise had a queer
premonition of trouble, "but we've come this far and I'm
going to see the thing through. If anything goes wrong
in that house it will be on account of that roll of blue
prints. I'll leave the roll with you, Carl, and you can
stay outside. I won't be in the house more than fifteen
minutes at most."</p>

<p>"Vell, you look a leedle oudt, Matt, dot's all. Oof
somet'ing goes wrong mit you, led off a yell und I vill
come gallywhooping."</p>

<p>"I don't think anything will go wrong with me if I
haven't those papers in my pocket."</p>

<p>Carl shivered.</p>

<p>"Chee, but der leedle fires on der chimneys iss prighdt.
Somet'ing aboudt dis blace gifs me a creepiness oof der
skin. Be jeerful, be jeerful! Don'd shday in dere longer
as den minids, Matt, oder I vas likely to t'row fits."</p>

<p>"I'll come out as soon as I can, Carl," answered Matt.
"Don't fret. I'm able to take care of myself in a pinch."</p>

<p>"Oof you see der pinch fairst, yah, I bed you! Aber
oof der pinch come ven you don'd vas looking, den vat?"</p>

<p>Matt laughed as he turned away, climbed a short flight
of steps and drummed on the front door. He had to rap
three or four times before his summons was answered.</p>

<p>A light showed itself through a fan-shaped transom
over the door, and a hand could be heard fumbling with
a rusty bolt. In a minute or so the door was drawn open
and a girl stood revealed. She carried a lamp with a
smoked chimney, and one of her slender hands protected
the flame from the draft.</p>

<p>She was eighteen or nineteen years old, and, in spite
of her coarse calico gown, she was extremely pretty. Her
prettiness, however, was not what impressed Matt. The
first thing he noticed was that the hand shielding the
lamp was trembling. Lifting his eyes to the girl's face,
he observed that she wore a frightened look.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Jerrold live here?" Matt asked.</p>

<p>The girl stared at him; her lips moved, but no sound
came through them. Matt repeated the question.</p>

<p>"Y-y-yes," faltered the girl.</p>

<p>"My name's King," answered Matt. "Mr. Jerrold sent
me a telegram and asked me to come here to-night."</p>

<p>The girl leaned forward eagerly as though she would
say something. Before she could speak, if she had intended
to, a sound as of some one moving in the darkness
behind her, caused her to draw back.</p>

<p>"Please come in," she said breathlessly.</p>

<p>Matt entered the hall. The girl closed the door behind
him and then, with the lamp shaking in her hand,
led him into a room off the hall.</p>

<p>The room was evidently a parlor, although its furniture
was meager and shabby.</p>

<p>"Please sit down," said the girl, placing the lamp on a
table. "Mr. B&mdash;Mr. Jerrold will be here in a few moments.
Would you like to read while you're waiting?"</p>

<p>Matt started to decline, but the girl had already picked
up a book from the table, opened it and was handing it
to him.</p>

<p>He looked at her in astonishment. From her frightened
face his eyes fell to the book that was quivering
in her hand. There was an appeal in her manner which
caused him to take the book.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said he.</p>

<p>The book was opened at the fly leaf. On the leaf was
written the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You are trapped. I would have warned you, if I
could, but he would have killed me. Now you are in the
house, you can't get away. Do whatever you are told to
do and all will be well. Lay the book back on the table,
and don't let any one know what you have read here."</p></blockquote>

<p>Matt was astounded. Trapped! And he had walked
into the trap with his eyes wide open!</p>

<p>Who was the girl and why had she run the risk to
warn him? And what good was her warning to do if he
did not take advantage of it and make his escape?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Now you are in the house, you can't get away."</p></blockquote>

<p>He read those words again, and after he had read
them he looked about the room curiously. There were
two windows in the room and they were screened with
thick curtains. Matt, however, could see no one. If the
trap had been sprung where were the ones who had
sprung it?</p>

<p>He realized that if he made an attempt to get out of
the house now, those who had entrapped him would immediately
conclude that the girl had given him a warning.
Thus he would not only fail to get away, but would
bring punishment upon the girl for her attempt to help
him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Do whatever you are told to do and all will be well."</p></blockquote>

<p>He read that over again and made up his mind that
he would follow the advice. He laid the book back on
the table, and, just at that moment, the girl re-entered the
room.</p>

<p>"I have read that book," said he.</p>

<p>"Here's a newspaper," said she.</p>

<p>As she held the paper in front of him she pointed to an
article, evidently intending that he should read it.</p>

<p>The girl was a mystery to Matt. From her manner
there was no doubt about her being anxious to do whatever
she could to shield him.</p>

<p>Leaving the paper in his hands, she walked over to the
table, opened the book and deftly extracted the fly leaf.
Then she vanished from the room once more.</p>

<p>Matt drew his chair closer to the table so that he could
get the full benefit of the dim light.</p>

<p>The first thing he noticed was that the paper was a
week old. It was a Chicago daily. The column to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
which the girl had called his attention was headed,
"Burglaries Continue! Astonishing Series of Robberies
in South Chicago are Still Kept Up! Thieves Make Off
With Loot and Leave Not a Clue Behind! Police Authorities
Baffled! Latest Victims Hartz &amp; Greer, Jewelers!"</p>

<p>Here followed an account dealing with a number of
mysterious burglaries, but Matt, because of the danger in
which he found himself, did not give the article the
attention he would otherwise have done.</p>

<p>He did wonder, however, why it was that the girl had
pointed out the article to him. While he was wondering,
a step sounded in the hall and a form showed itself in the
hall door.</p>

<p>The man was Brady!</p>

<p>Matt sprang up. Brady came into the room with an
easy air and gave vent to a short laugh.</p>

<p>He was quite a different looking man when out of his
greasy overclothes, but there was no doubting his identity.
Matt's fist had left a bruise on the side of Brady's
face, and the spot was covered with a square of court-plaster.</p>

<p>"Surprised?" queried Brady, dropping into a chair.</p>

<p>Before seating himself he was careful to draw the chair
in front of the hall door.</p>

<p>"Were you the one who sent me that telegram?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"Guilty!" was the chuckling response. "You were expecting
to meet Jerrold, eh? I was a little in doubt as to
whether you'd bite at the bait, but took a chance. You're
a mighty accommodating young fellow, King. Why,
you came all the way out here, at this time of night, just
to give Jerrold those papers! Didn't it strike you as being
a little bit queer that Jerrold should have asked you
to come and see him when it was his business to go and
see you? And then, again, how did you think Jerrold
got hold of your name and address? Oh, well, you've a
lot to learn yet, my lad."</p>

<p>"I'm learning you pretty fast, Brady," said Matt. "You
have fooled me, but you've gained nothing by it."</p>

<p>"I think I have," was the other's cool reply.</p>

<p>"You'll not get that bundle of papers."</p>

<p>"No? Haven't you got them with you?"</p>

<p>"I left them where they'd be safe."</p>

<p>"Then you suspected there was something a little off-color
about that telegram?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Plucky boy! Nevertheless, you dropped into my trap,
and that's the main thing. Those papers cost me a good
deal of scheming, and if you were really thoughtful
enough to leave them in a safe place, I'm mighty sorry."</p>

<p>"You can search me," said Matt, "if you're not willing
to take my word."</p>

<p>"I'll search you quick enough."</p>

<p>"Then hurry up; I want to get away from here."</p>

<p>"Those papers are not the whole of it," went on Brady.
"I want to make you a proposition, King. I need a
motorist for the Hawk, and I think you'd about fill the
bill. How would five hundred a month strike you?"</p>

<p>"Five thousand a month wouldn't strike me. In the
first place, Mr. Brady, I don't like your methods and
wouldn't work for you at any price; and, in the next
place, I am already in the employ of the Lestrange people."</p>

<p>"You'll work for me all right whether you like my
methods or not." There was an ugly look in Brady's
eyes and an ugly note in his voice. "You're just the sort
of youngster I need, and now that I've got a grip on you
I don't intend to let you get away."</p>

<p>"It takes two to make that sort of a bargain!"</p>

<p>Matt had edged around toward one of the windows
with the intention of making a break through the door.</p>

<p>Brady got up.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for, Pete?" he called.</p>

<p>Matt turned a quick gaze about him, wondering from
which direction Pete was to appear. Then, quick as a
lightning flash, the curtain behind him gave way and fell
in smothering folds over his head and shoulders. Two
brawny arms encircled him like the jaws of a vise.</p>

<p>He fought with all his strength, and tried to yell to
Carl. But one effort was as ineffectual as the other.</p>

<p>Pete and Brady had him between them, and he was
utterly powerless.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">CARL INVESTIGATES.</p>


<p>Carl hated a "waiting" game. If there was anything
going on, he liked to be right in the midst of it. On top
of all this, he was vaguely suspicious of everything connected
with that telegram.</p>

<p>When Matt went up and knocked on the door of the
house, Carl was hoping the summons would not be answered;
but when the door opened, and Matt disappeared
inside the house, Carl's real worries began.</p>

<p>Pacing back and forth on the walk, the Dutch boy impatiently
counted the seconds and checked off the minutes.
No sound came from the building, and, after the
light had vanished from the hall, not a ray was to be
seen at any of the windows.</p>

<p>"I t'ink, py shiminy," muttered Carl to himself, "dot
der fifdeen minids vas oop. Vell, I count off fife more
schust for goot measure. After dot, oof Matt don'd
come, I vill make some infestigations."</p>

<p>Owing to the lateness of the hour, and the obscure section
of the town through which that part of Hoyne
Street ran, no one passed the front of the house. Carl's
solitary vigil was not relieved by the sight of any chance
traveler.</p>

<p>Mentally he checked off another five minutes. During
the counting he fancied he heard a noise in the house, but
it was so muffled and indistinct he could not be sure.
Matt did not show himself, and Carl started his investigations.</p>

<p>His first move was to run up the steps and pound on
the door. Although he made enough noise to wake the
entire neighborhood, he couldn't bring anybody to the
entrance. He tried the knob, but found the door fastened.
Then he hurled his weight against the door in the hope
of breaking it in. The door must have been in better
repair than the rest of the house, for it withstood his
attack with scarcely a shiver.</p>

<p>Carl's temper was always pretty close to the surface,
and his failure to get into the house caused him to forget
his forebodings on Matt's account and to get good
and mad on his own.</p>

<p>"I vill find Matt oof I haf to preak down a vinder!"
fumed Carl, jumping down from the steps and starting
to run around the side of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello, there!" shouted a voice most unexpectedly
from the sidewalk. "What're you up to, hey?"</p>

<p>Carl halted and looked around. In the glow of the
furnace fires he saw a man standing in front of the
house.</p>

<p>"Vat iss it your pitzness?" he snapped. "I'm going to
ged indo dot blace oof I haf to preak holes in it!"</p>

<p>"I'll make it my business, quick enough!" called the
other. "Come here, and be quick about it."</p>

<p>There was authority in the voice, and the command
was accompanied by a backward sweep of the hand under
a long coat. When the hand reappeared, there was a
glimmering object clutched in the fingers. The light also
glimmered on two rows of buttons on the speaker's coat.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber!" muttered Carl. "You vas an officer,
hey?"</p>

<p>"Come here, quick!" ordered the man. "Tell me
where that balloon came from. It seemed to rise from
around in this vicinity somewhere."</p>

<p>By that time, Carl had reached the walk. The officer
pointed upward, and Carl's eyes, following the finger,
saw an air-ship clearly outlined against the glow of the
blazing chimneys. The cigar-shaped gas-bag and the
pendent car stood out plainly. The front end of the air-ship
was pointed upward, and it was vanishing swiftly
into the night.</p>

<p>"Himmelblitzen!" gasped Carl. "Dot vas der Hawk!
It must be der Hawk!"</p>

<p>"Hawk, eh?" returned the officer. "What do you
know about it? The thing seemed to rise up in the air
from around here."</p>

<p>"Iss dot so?" cried Carl, excitedly. "Vell, I ditn't see
him, und dot's righdt. I vas drying so hardt as anyt'ing
to ged indo der house."</p>

<p>"I heard you tryin' to break in the door. Don't you
know it's against the law to do that?"</p>

<p>"I don'd care for der law! My bard vent indo dot
house und left me to vait. Ven I vait plendy long enough
for him und he don'd come, den I make some infestigations.
No vone answers my knock on der door, und for
vy iss dot?"</p>

<p>"You say a friend of yours is in the house?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Don'd I vas delling you?"</p>

<p>"When did he go in?"</p>

<p>"Haluf oof an hour ago&mdash;all oof dot."</p>

<p>The officer began questioning Carl and got from him
pretty near the whole of the affair&mdash;Matt's name and occupation,
the experience with the air-ship in the early
part of the afternoon, nearly everything concerning the
roll of papers, the receipt of the telegram, and the night
visit of the boys to South Chicago.</p>

<p>This policeman was an intelligent member of the force,
and he at once concluded that here was a matter which
called for official investigation.</p>

<p>"We'll get into the house and find out about your
friend," said he. "Your yarn is a queer one, but has the
true ring, and it's evident there's shady work of some
kind going on."</p>

<p>"Shaty vork? Vell, you bed you! Vere iss Matt?
Dot's vat I vand to know vorse as anyt'ing else. I ditn't
vant him to go in dere, anyvay, aber ven he makes oop
his mindt to do somet'ing, den it vas as goot as done
und vat I say don'd cut some ice."</p>

<p>"If he's in there we'll get him," said the officer, decidedly.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to more drastic operations, he went
up to the door and pounded on it with his night-stick.
The summons, although several times repeated, was not
answered. Thereupon the policeman and Carl, throwing
their united weight upon the door, burst the bolt from
its fastenings and tumbled into the hall.</p>

<p>The darkness of the interior was relieved only by the
glare of the furnaces coming in at the transom. Silence
reigned everywhere.</p>

<p>"I don'd like der looks oof t'ings," muttered Carl, forebodingly.
"Dere don'd vas anypody ad home now, aber
ven Matt come in dere vas plendy oof people here. Vat
toes it mean, officer?"</p>

<p>"We'll try and find out what it means."</p>

<p>There was an electric dark lantern at the policeman's
belt. Taking the lantern in his hand he switched on the
light and sent a bright gleam into every nook and corner
of the hall.</p>

<p>No sign of Matt, nor of any of the occupants of the
house, was revealed. There were only two or three
rooms furnished on the lower floor, and none at all on
the floor above. Every part of the house was searched,
and the last place of all to pass under the policeman's
and Carl's scrutiny was the shallow basement.</p>

<p>It was evident to both searchers that people had been
in the house up to a very recent moment, for in one of
the first-floor rooms there remained an odor of tobacco
smoke, but there was no living person anywhere in evidence.</p>

<p>"Don'd dot peat ter tickens?" murmured Carl. "Matt
come in der front door, und he ditn't come oudt oof it.
Oof he vas daken away it must haf peen py der pack oof
der house. Meppy ve pedder haf a look ad der pack
yardt?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," answered the officer.</p>

<p>Bending down he picked some object off the floor and
examined it under the rays of the lantern. An exclamation
of surprise and wonder fell from his lips.</p>

<p>"Vat it iss?" queried Carl.</p>

<p>"Here's the biggest kind of a find!" was the response.
"Thunder! this must be my lucky night."</p>

<p>"How you figger dot?"</p>

<p>"This is a canvas bag."</p>

<p>"Yah, I see dot, aber it ditn't pelong by Matt und it
don'd dell us nodding aboudt vere he vas."</p>

<p>"It's marked 'Hartz &amp; Greer, Jewelers,'" went on the
policeman, his voice shaking with excitement. "That's
a firm doing business right here in South Chicago, and
their store was burglarized mysteriously a little more
than a week ago. Some fifteen thousand dollars' worth
of jewelry and diamonds were taken, and this," the officer
shook the canvas bag, "<i>this</i> is the first clue any one
has found to the robbers!"</p>

<p>"Shiminy Grismus!" muttered Carl. "Dis must haf
peen der blace vere der t'ieves hat deir hang-oudt. Aber
dot don'd got some interest for me. Vat I vant to know
iss, vere iss Modor Matt? Dis pitzness iss gedding on
my nerfs aboudt like dot odder time ven he tissabeared
schust pefore der cup race. Shtick der pag in your
bocket, officer, und led's haf some looks at der pack
yardt."</p>

<p>The policeman, now wrapped heart and soul in the
hunt, put the bag away in the breast of his coat.</p>

<p>The door leading into the back yard, as they had already
discovered, was unlocked. The rear premises
were enclosed by a high board fence, and the beacons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that capped the neighboring chimneys lighted the enclosure
sufficiently so that the lantern was not needed.</p>

<p>There was a very perceptible odor of gasolene in the
back yard. The moment Carl sniffed it, he gave vent to
a stifled yell and grabbed the policeman's arm with both
hands.</p>

<p>"What's to pay now?" demanded the policeman.</p>

<p>"Der air-ship!" gasped Carl.</p>

<p>The officer threw a startled look at the sky.</p>

<p>"No, no, it ain'd oop dere," went on Carl. "It vas in
dis pack yardt&mdash;yah, so helup me! Der gasolene used in
der modor make der shmell. Don'd you ondershtand?
Dey filled der tank here, und shpilled some oof der gasolene!
Dose fellers haf run off from dis blace mit Matt,
und dey have dook him along. Ach, himmelblitzen, vat
a luck!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">JERROLD, BRADY'S RIVAL.</p>


<p>"Thunder!" cried the policeman, catching the Dutch
boy's drift, "you're right, as sure as my name is Sam
Harris! Your friend went off in that air-ship."</p>

<p>"He ditn't vent," protested Carl, in a temper, "he vas
dook."</p>

<p>"Well, he was carried off in the thing, no matter
whether he went of his own free will or was taken by
force. If we each of us had a pair of wings we might
follow the flyin' machine, but we ain't got 'em, so we'll
have to do what we can on the ground."</p>

<p>"Dere iss a palloon house oudt on der roadt py der
rolling mills," suggested Carl. "Meppy der Hawk vas
dere. Dot's vere Prady keeps him ven he ain'd sky-hootin'
t'roo der clouds. Meppy ve go und take a look
at der palloon house, eh?"</p>

<p>"I know the place, and it won't do any harm to go
there and look&mdash;but the fellow who ran off with your
friend would be foolish to drop down there."</p>

<p>"Vell, foolish or nod, ve look efery blace vat ve can."</p>

<p>The balloon house was not a great way from that part
of Hoyne Street, and Harris and Carl reached it after a
cross-lots walk of five minutes.</p>

<p>They found the great doors open, but there was no
air-ship in the place and no one on watch around it.
Furthermore, an examination of the interior showed that
an extensive clean-up had been made of the various tools
which Matt and Carl had seen in the place during the
afternoon. Everything of value had been removed.</p>

<p>Carl explained all this for the officer's benefit.</p>

<p>"It's a cinch the owner of the air-ship has changed his
headquarters," commented Harris. "Brady, you say, the
fellow's name is? Well, he's an inventor. One of his
inventions is a patent 'jimmy'&mdash;which, of course, he
wouldn't dare to patent. We've been watching his air-ship
operations, here in South Chicago, but they seemed
straight and legitimate enough."</p>

<p>"Do you know dot feller, Hamildon Jerrold?" asked
Carl.</p>

<p>"Sure, I know him. He's all right, Jerrold is, although
everybody looks on him as a harmless sort of crank."</p>

<p>"He don'd lif in dot blace vere der chimney fires iss?"</p>

<p>"No; he hangs out in a different part of town."</p>

<p>"Den, you see, it vas a put-oop chob all aroundt. It
vas Prady, I bed you, vat sendt dot delegram, got Matt
in a drap, und den flew off mit him in der Hawk. Meppy
ve make a call on Jerrold?"</p>

<p>"I'll call up the department and report," said Harris,
"so they can send another man on my beat while I'm
fooling around on this case."</p>

<p>They hurried back into town and the officer unlocked
one of the lamp-post boxes and reported to headquarters.</p>

<p>"All right," said he as he rejoined Carl. "Now we'll
put in the rest of the night, if we have to. If Brady has
had a hand in the robberies that have been going on here,
this is liable to be good and profitable work for me."</p>

<p>Jerrold lived almost a mile from the place where Harris
had done his telephoning. He had a large, rambling
old house set far back in a dense mass of trees and
shrubbery.</p>

<p>"He's a good deal of a hermit," explained Harris, as
he and Carl proceeded along the walk to the front door.
"A harmless old skate, but he's pretty broad between the
eyes, at that."</p>

<p>It was after midnight, and, as might be supposed, the
house was dark. A knock on the door brought a night-capped
head from an upper window.</p>

<p>"Who's down there?" demanded a voice. "Is it you,
Payne?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Jerrold," answered Harris, "it's a police officer.
I've come to see you on important business."</p>

<p>"Have you found the Hawk?" cried Jerrold; "did you
get back the plans those rascals stole from me?"</p>

<p>"Come down and let us in," said the officer. "We want
to talk with you."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute."</p>

<p>The head was withdrawn and the window dropped. A
little while later, the front door opened and Jerrold
showed himself, carrying a candle. Carl recognized him
as one of the two men who had been pursuing the Hawk
in the buggy.</p>

<p>"Don'd you know me, Misder Jerrold?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>The inventor stared at him and shook his head.
Thereupon Carl explained where and when they had met.
Jerrold's brows wrinkled in a frown.</p>

<p>Leading his callers into a small sitting room he asked
them to sit down.</p>

<p>"What do you know about this fellow Brady, Jerrold?"
asked Harris, by way of getting at the business in hand.</p>

<p>"I know he's a scoundrel!" declared Jerrold with emphasis.
"He's a good mechanic, though, and in spite of
his shady record I took him on here to help me build my
air-ship, the Eagle. After he had been with me for a
while, I found he was stealing my ideas and building an
air-ship of his own. Then I discharged him. Since then
he's been attending to his own operations and I have
been attending to mine. There are several important
points about my machine, though, which Brady has been
anxious to discover. He has tried to bribe Payne, the
man who works for me, to give up a set of my blue
prints, and he has tried to get them in other underhand
ways. At about eleven o'clock, yesterday, three of
Brady's men tried out-and-out robbery. That safe was
forced"&mdash;Jerrold pointed to a small steel safe in one corner
of the room&mdash;"and the roll of blue prints taken out.
Payne and I were in the workshop at the time. We
had just put the finishing touches to the Eagle and were
inflating the bag for a trial. I heard a suspicious sound
from the house and ran into this room. One of the
thieves had just cleared an open window, another was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
getting out and the third was making ready to go. I
had a wrench in my hand and I hurled it at the man in
the room. He dropped without a groan. Payne came,
just then, and we went after the other two. Brady's
air-ship was waiting for them in the rear of the house,
and the two robbers got into it and were away before we
could catch them. Payne and I got a horse and buggy,
as quick as we could, but by that time the air-ship was
no more than a speck in the sky, off to the south. We
followed, keeping the course the air-ship had taken. The
men aboard didn't seem to know how to handle the craft
very well, and I was hoping some accident would happen,
that the craft would come down and that I would be
able to get back my blue prints."</p>

<p>Jerrold halted for a little, his face flaming with anger
and indignation.</p>

<p>"I haven't my patents, yet," he went on, in a few moments,
"and haven't even been able to establish a caveat,
so, you see, if Brady should get ahead of me at the
patent office he would snatch a fortune out of my hands.
For," and here the inventor threw back his head with
laudable pride, "I claim to have invented an air-ship
that can be used for commercial purposes&mdash;the first machine
of the kind that will successfully navigate the air
against the strongest wind that blows. But if that scoundrel
Brady takes from me the fruits of my toil, I shall
be ruined!"</p>

<p>Jerrold's body slumped forward in his chair, and he
crouched there in an attitude of extreme dejection.</p>

<p>"Where's the fellow you knocked down with the
wrench?" asked Harris, his professional mind dealing
with the more practicable aspects of the case.</p>

<p>"When Payne and I got back to the room, after pursuing
the other two rascals to the Hawk," answered
Jerrold, "the man had vanished. I suppose he recovered
from the effects of the blow and took himself off."</p>

<p>"He vas der feller vat drove der modor in der Hawk,"
explained Carl, "und ven he vas pud down und oudt, der
odder fellers made poor vork oof triving der machine.
Aber dot ain'd vat I got on my mindt, schust now."
Carl pulled the roll of blue prints from his pocket. "Dere,
Misder Jerrold," said he, "iss vat you lost. Take it mit
der gombliments oof Modor Matt&mdash;my bard who iss
gone I don'd know vere. Oof you hat shtopped a leedle
in der puggy, und toldt us vat I haf heardt schust now,
den, by shinks, you vould haf got der bapers pack a long
dime ago."</p>

<p>A cry of delight broke from Jerrold's lips. For a moment
he stared at the roll, then swooped down on it with
both hands, caught it away from Carl and began removing
the wrapper with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>"Here they are, here they are," he crooned joyfully,
pawing the blue prints over and counting them, one by
one; "they're all here, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short and stared blankly at the envelope,
which had fallen out of the blue-prints and dropped on
the carpet.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Harris.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Jerrold; "it's nothing of mine
and wasn't in the safe, to my recollection, at the time
the blue prints were taken."</p>

<p>"Well, it may be yours, for all that. If it was in the
roll, it stands to reason it must have been in the safe.
Better open it. Probably you can tell from the contents
whether it is yours or not."</p>

<p>Harris picked up the envelope and handed it to Jerrold.
The latter took it from him with a puzzled expression
on his face.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure this isn't mine," said he, turning the
envelope over and over.</p>

<p>"Well, you've got to be absolutely sure," returned Harris.</p>

<p>Jerrold, thus urged, tore open the envelope, drew out
the sheet and cast his eyes over it.</p>

<p>"No," he declared, "it doesn't belong to me. The
thieves must have put it in with the blue prints."</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at it," said the officer.</p>

<p>Drawing closer to the candle, Harris proceeded to read
the letter. While he read, his face brightened and a look
of surprise and exultation rose in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Another clue, and a hot one!" he cried. He whirled
on Carl. "With this as a guide," he went on, "it's dollars
to doughnuts we can trace your friend and get him
away from that scoundrel, Brady!"</p>

<p>"Ach, vat a habbiness!" expanded Carl. "Readt it
oudt to me, Harris, und be kevick ad it."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">JERROLD'S GRATITUDE.</p>


<p>"The letter," explained Harris, "was written by Brady,
and was evidently entrusted to the men in the Hawk for
delivery to some one else. It's full of pointers, and a
slicker bit of evidence it would be hard to find. And to
think how it dropped into the hands of Motor Matt!
The whole affair sounds like a 'pipe.'"</p>

<p>"Tell me about that!" cried Jerrold, his shock of joy
having passed and left him leisure for other things.
"Who is this Motor Matt, and how did he happen to get
hold of the blue prints?"</p>

<p>"Ve vill go ofer dot lader, Misder Jerrold," said Carl,
impatiently. "Schust now, dough, I vant to hear vat der
ledder say. Readt him oudt, Harris! I vas so uneasy
ofer it I don'd vas aple to sit shdill."</p>

<p>"It's addressed to a man called Whipple," went on
Harris, "and here's the way it runs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Grove, Needham and Harper, with one of my improved
jimmies, are going to make another try for those
blue prints of Jerrold's. If they get them&mdash;and I think
they can, for our plans are well laid&mdash;they'll carry the
papers to Willoughby's swamp in the Hawk and leave
them with you. We will quit our operations in South
Chicago, clean out the balloon house (I have already sold
the building for old lumber) and make our future headquarters
in the swamp. It will be safer there. After
we improve the Hawk according to Jerrold's plans, we
will have a ship in which we can go anywhere, and with
which we can do anything. All we need is a competent
motorist&mdash;Harper's good enough for an amateur, but we
need a professional. I'll try and bring one with me, when
I come. Meanwhile, until I show up at the swamp, I
want you to take good care of the blue prints.</p>

<p class="sig">
"'H. B.'"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>A great light dawned on Carl during the reading of
the letter&mdash;a light so strong that it left him blinking.</p>

<p>"Py chimineddy," he gurgled, "I know now vy dot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Prady run off mit Matt! He say in der ledder dot he
vants some brofessional to run dot air-ship. Vell, Matt
knows more as anypody aboudt modors, und so Prady
dook him off. Vat a high-hantet pitzness! Und Prady
has captured a hornet oof he dit pud know it! He vill
t'ink he has a handtful ven he dries to make Matt vork
for him."</p>

<p>"From this," proceeded Harris, waving the letter, "it
seems that Brady had already laid his plans to quit
South Chicago. In the letter, over his own signature,
he admits sending three of his men to steal the blue
prints. By a chance, and owing to the course of events
in keeping the driver of the air-ship from getting away
with the other two thieves, this roll and the letter dropped
into the hands of Motor Matt. Undoubtedly, Motor
Matt has been taken to Willoughby's swamp."</p>

<p>"Und vere iss dot?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"I know about the swamp," went on Harris, "for I
helped some Chicago officers run down a couple of escaped
prisoners there, once. It's a bad hole, but there is
a sort of island in the middle of it that has been the resort
of criminals for a good many years. To get through
the water, and mud, and tangled bushes to the island is
a hard job for any one who has to go on foot. Still, it
can be done. Brady and his men, of course, can use the
Hawk, and all they have to do is to sail through the air
and drop down where they want to go. The difficulties
of the swamp won't bother them at all. The place is
about four miles from Lake Station, Indiana."</p>

<p>"Vell," said Carl, eagerly, "led's go dere. Der kevicker
vat ve go, der kevicker vat ve can helup Matt. He iss
my bard, und he needs me now."</p>

<p>The Dutch boy got up and started for the door.
Bounding from his chair, Jerrold overtook him and
grabbed his arm.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he commanded, "I've only got a faint grasp
of the situation, but from what I can figure out you're
going to need me. First, though, I want to hear all
about this Motor Matt. He has done a whole lot for
Hamilton Jerrold, and Jerrold is a man who always tries
to pay his debts. Tell me how the blue prints got into
the hands of Motor Matt."</p>

<p>"Aber ve vas in a hurry!" cried Carl. "Villoughpy's
svamp iss a goot vays off, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll save time in the end by losing a little here and
now," averred Jerrold, drawing Carl to a chair and pushing
him down into it. "Go on! Give me the whole of it,
between you, and be quick."</p>

<p>There was a compelling note in the inventor's words
and manner, that demanded attention. Carl yielded and
struck into an explanation of the events of the preceding
afternoon. Whenever his impatience led him to skip any
of the details, Harris, who recognized the advantage of
letting Jerrold know everything, picked up the ignored
detail and made Carl go over it.</p>

<p>Jerrold's interest and excitement increased as he listened.
When Carl described how he and Matt had
fought with Brady and Pete at the balloon house and
kept them from getting the blue prints, Jerrold clapped
his hands and shouted "Bravo!" And when Carl told
of the bogus telegram that had brought the boys to South
Chicago, Jerrold's face clouded with indignation and
anger.</p>

<p>"Motor Matt," declared Jerrold, when Carl had finally
finished, "has done a lot for me, and he's going to find
that Hamilton Jerrold knows how to be grateful. I
agree with Harris that there is hardly a doubt but that
Brady has taken young King to Willoughby's swamp.
Brady wants the young motorist for the Hawk, and intends
to have him, whether or no. According to Harris,
the swamp's a difficult place to get at for those not
equipped with an air-ship. That's where I come in.
This way, friends!"</p>

<p>With that, the inventor caught up his candle and led
the way through the house and out at a back door.</p>

<p>By then it was nearly three o'clock, and the very
darkest part of the night. A gust of wind blew out the
candle, which had been about as effective as a glow-worm,
and the three were left at the foot of the rear
steps staring at a fluttering expanse of canvas.</p>

<p>The canvas formed a sort of V-shaped tent, long and
high and secured with many guy-ropes. Because of the
darkness it was difficult to get any kind of an idea as to
the size of the tent, but that was a minor point.</p>

<p>"I'll have to get a lantern," said Jerrold. "Wait a
minute."</p>

<p>"I've got a dark lantern, Jerrold," interposed Harris,
"and I guess that will do."</p>

<p>"Fine!" exclaimed Jerrold, as Harris switched on the
current and swung the beam of light around him. "This
way," the inventor added, and ducked through the end
of the tent.</p>

<p>In the gloomy interior a weird sight was disclosed&mdash;something
so new and novel as to send an uncanny sensation
along the nerves of Carl and Harris.</p>

<p>Here was another cigar-shaped gas-bag, and another
suspended car. The car itself was stationary, but the
bag, because of the drafts that surged through the tent,
was bobbing and swaying like some monster, anxious to
be unleashed.</p>

<p>The flickering gleam from the dark lantern could only
disclose a part of the air-ship at a time.</p>

<p>"Ach," muttered Carl, "dot makes my nerfs shake
und shake like anyt'ing. Sooch a horrible t'ing vat it
iss!"</p>

<p>"That's because you're not familiar with such a craft,"
said Jerrold. "Payne and I have worked over it for
years, and only yesterday saw the completion of our
labors. It was six o'clock last night before the bag was
fully inflated. We had to use common illuminating-gas,
too, and the not more buoyant hydrogen. I have called
the air-ship the 'Eagle,' and if you sweep that light along
the side of the bag you will see the name."</p>

<p>This was a bit of byplay that took time and was utterly
needless, but a great pride throbbed in the inventor's
words, and even the smallest detail of the air-ship was
fraught with the utmost importance to him.</p>

<p>"Everything about the craft," Jerrold went on, "is of
the very best. The motor is the lightest, strongest and
most powerful ever constructed. The car will carry half
a dozen, easily. Sand-bags are suspended from each end
of the gas-bag. When I pull in the sand-bag at the
front end, the equilibrium is displaced, the bag points
upward, and the propeller forces the air-ship to rise. So,
when I wish to descend, I pull in the sand-bag at the rear
point of the bag. When both bags are hanging loose,
the Eagle swims in the air on an even keel. Now, the
steering rudder, which also helps in maneuvering the ship,
is a little idea of my own and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ach, hang der shdeering rutter!" broke in Carl, impatiently.
"Harris und I haf got to go afder Matt und<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
ve can't vait aroundt here any longer. Ve haf got to go
py dot svamp, und&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" broke in the inventor. "The Eagle, fully
inflated and with a tank full of gasoline, is waiting for
a trial spin in the morning. I have the honor to propose
that we use the craft now, proceed to Willoughby's
swamp and rescue Motor Matt. That will save time, and
a whole lot of hardships in forcing your way through
mud and water and tangled brush in order to reach the
island."</p>

<p>Harris had already gathered the inventor's idea, even
before he began putting it into words; Carl, however,
had not anticipated the suggestion, and he was dazed
by it.</p>

<p>"You mean to dake us py der svamp in der Eagle?" he
asked, in some trepidation.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ach, himmel! I nefer rode mit a air-ship. Vill I be
seasick py it?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. You see, I have never navigated
an air-ship myself, but I'll bank on the Eagle doing its
work. I can run the engine."</p>

<p>"Vat oof it shouldt durn oopside town mit us vile ve
vas a mile in der air?"</p>

<p>"I'll guarantee it won't do that."</p>

<p>"Vell, vedder or nod," said Carl, "I am going afder
my bard. Oof der tangers vas greadt, I take dem; und
oof dey vasn't so greadt, den I take dem, too. Matt
vouldt do more as dot for me, yah, I bed you!"</p>

<p>Harris was also afflicted with doubts.</p>

<p>"The ground has always been good enough for me,
Jerrold," said he, "and whenever I get my feet off it
and go up any distance I have a bad case of vertigo. If
I should get dizzy and fall off the car&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't," interrupted the inventor; "people never
get dizzy in balloons."</p>

<p>"You're sure it won't tip over and spill us out?"</p>

<p>"Positive."</p>

<p>"You don't know much about it yourself, you know,
having never been up in it."</p>

<p>"That scoundrel, Brady, has used the Hawk with fair
success, and the Hawk is modeled on the same lines as
the Eagle, only the Eagle has improvements which Brady
was not able to get hold of and put on his own machine.
Shall we go to the rescue of Motor Matt? Come, my
friends, time is flying."</p>

<p>"Und ve ought to be flying, too," said Carl, now eager
to make the ascension.</p>

<p>"I'll take a chance," observed Harris.</p>

<p>"Good!" applauded Jerrold.</p>

<p>The next moment he had vanished in the darkness and
could be heard pulling at some ropes. In less than a
minute the entire top of the tent fell away, revealing the
stars.</p>

<p>"Get into the car," said Jerrold, "there, just forward
of the driver's seat."</p>

<p>With the aid of his lantern Harris picked out the place
where he and Carl were to stow themselves, and they
climbed into the car as directed.</p>

<p>Immediately after that, Jerrold got over the rail and
took his seat at the levers. It was impossible to see just
what he was doing, but the clank of a lever came from
his vicinity and slowly the front of the gas-bag began
to point upward.</p>

<p>"Now we're ready," called the inventor.</p>

<p>The popping of a motor began and gradually gathered
into a swift murmur.</p>

<p>"And now we're off," added Jerrold. "Stay right
where you are and don't change your positions unless I
tell you."</p>

<p>The whir of the propeller started, and the house and
shrubbery began slipping away from under those in the
car.</p>

<p>"Ach, du lieber!" gasped Carl. "Der eart' vas falling
avay from us. I vill say my brayers forvarts, packvarts
und sidevays, oof it vill helup any."</p>

<p>"I've got a bad case of rattles, myself," admitted Harris.
"But it's for your pard, my boy."</p>

<p>"You bed my life!" returned Carl, "aber I never dit
anyt'ing pefore for dot bard oof mine dot dook so mooch
nerf as vat dis toes. I vill shud my eyes, und you dell
me, blease, ven ve reach der svamp!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ABOARD THE HAWK.</p>


<p>Taken at a disadvantage and with two brawny ruffians
ranged against him, Motor Matt was unable to make any
defense. As he lay on the floor, head and shoulders
still swathed in the window-curtain, one of his antagonists
held him while the other bound his hands and feet
with a rope. He was then lifted and carried for some
distance. Naturally he could have no idea where or in
what direction he was being carried.</p>

<p>A few steps were descended and he heard a door softly
closed. The cool air of outdoors laved his hands&mdash;he was
sensible of that, although the hot stuffiness of the curtain
prevented the night air from reaching his face.</p>

<p>He was lifted over something, he did not know what,
and laid down in cramped quarters. A conversation was
going on around him, but in tones so low he was not
able to distinguish the words. He fancied that he heard
the girl's voice, although his head was so muffled he
could not be sure.</p>

<p>Presently the unmistakable explosions of a motor came
to him.</p>

<p>"Brady is taking me away somewhere in an automobile,"
he thought, and wondered where Carl was that he
could not see the machine.</p>

<p>A moment later he felt a gentle, swaying motion as
though he was being gently swung in a hammock.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed, and then Brady's voice spoke,
in a tone so loud that Matt was able to hear what he
said.</p>

<p>"Take the curtain off his head, Pete, and untie him.
It's time he took hold here. Keep your revolver handy
for use in case he gets obstreperous. He's full of ginger
and will have to be tamed."</p>

<p>Matt felt some one working at his cords. They were
stripped away quickly, and the curtain whisked from his
head. He jumped up, the floor under him swinging with
the quick move and almost upsetting him.</p>

<p>"Careful, there!" warned Brady. "Where do you think
you are, anyhow?"</p>

<p>Matt was dumfounded. Overhead was the long gas-bag
of the Hawk. In front of him, at the mechanism of
the machine, sat a dusky form which he recognized as
belonging to Brady. Brady's hands were on the levers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>With a shout of anger Matt jumped toward Brady,
the car lurching and swaying with his frantic movements.</p>

<p>"Stand where ye are!" came the husky, threatening
voice of Pete, from behind. "Do as I tell ye, King, or
I'll shoot."</p>

<p>Matt turned around. Standing with his back braced
against an upright timber that held the car to the oval
ring under the gas-bag was Brady's burly assistant. He
held a dark object in his hand and Matt knew it must
be a revolver.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"Turn around this way," said Brady. "Now that you
know what'll happen to you if you get too hostile, maybe
we can have a bit of a talk together."</p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" implored a feminine voice; "I don't
want to have any shooting, dad!"</p>

<p>The voice came from a bundle on the floor, close to
where Pete was standing. By looking sharply, Matt was
able to see a white, ghost-like face hovering against the
rail.</p>

<p>The girl had been brought along with them! Matt
was glad, for her sake, that he had not got into a rough-and-tumble
with Brady.</p>

<p>Without seeming to pay the girl more than passing attention,
the young motorist turned toward the man in the
chair.</p>

<p>"Well?" said he, crisply. "What have you got to say
about this, Brady? I guess you could be arrested for
what you've done, all right."</p>

<p>Brady laughed.</p>

<p>"How's a policeman coming up here to get at me?"
he asked. "An air-ship is a great thing for a fellow
who wants to turn a few tricks in spite of the law."</p>

<p>"That's your game, is it? Well, what have you to gain
by running off with me? I told you I didn't have that
roll of papers."</p>

<p>"I'm out the blue prints, but I'm in a good motorist.
I'll not be able to improve the Hawk according to Jerrold's
plans, but I guess I've got hold of a driver that's
good enough to make up for most of the improvements."</p>

<p>"If you think I'm going to drive this car for you,"
said Matt, "you're away off in your calculations."</p>

<p>"That's what you think now, but you'll change your
tune before long," said Brady, easily. "I know this air-ship
pretty well, and I installed the motor. All it needed
for that was a good machinist and a good inventor. I'm
not a good driver, though, and I've picked you for the
job. The offer I made back at the house goes. Five
hundred a month. Pretty good pay, eh, for a boy of
your age?"</p>

<p>"I don't care how much you offer, Brady. As I have
already told you, no amount of money could hire me to
work for you. You're a scoundrel, clear through. What
you've done to-night proves it.</p>

<p>"Bear a little to the left, Brady!" called Pete, who was
evidently on the lookout. "You're getting too far to the
north."</p>

<p>Brady moved one of the levers, and the ease and certainty
with which the air-ship swung to the new direction
brought Matt's admiration uppermost. Never had he
been able to resist the lure of untried machinery, and
here was an experience so novel that it carried him out
of his troubled environment, so to speak. For a moment,
suspended in that starlit void and swimming noiselessly
through the night, he yielded himself to the fascinations
of the new experience.</p>

<p>"How powerful a motor have you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ten horse-power," answered Brady, "and it weighs
forty pounds."</p>

<p>"How do you steer the machine up and down, and
right and left?"</p>

<p>"That's where I've got the bulge on Jerrold. One
rudder with two cross-section planes does all of that.
This lever here&mdash;I don't know whether you can see it or
not from where you stand&mdash;gives the up and down 'dip'
to the rudder that makes the machine rise or fall. By
moving the lever right or left, the air-ship turns in the
corresponding direction."</p>

<p>"Take me back," ordered Matt, "and land me at the
place where you took me from."</p>

<p>"You've got a picture of me doing that!" scoffed
Brady. "Now that I've caught you, I'm going to keep
you, see? You're just the sort of a lad I need in my
business. Grove and Needham, when they finally got
back to South Chicago with the air-ship, told me all
about you. If I'd known what I do now at the time
you called at the balloon house, I'd have taken a different
tack."</p>

<p>A muttered imprecation came from Pete. He was
thinking of his fall over the barrel.</p>

<p>"Those fellows got back without breaking their necks,
did they?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Just about. When they told me what had happened,
I sent off that telegram."</p>

<p>"We might just as well look this thing square in the
face, Brady," said Matt. "You've acted the part of a
scoundrel in your dealings with me, and you haven't
gained anything by it. If you don't turn back and put
me down in South Chicago, I'll make more trouble for
you than you can well take care of."</p>

<p>"I'll take my chances on that, my bantam. I like your
spirit, and we're going to get along fine. Just cast in
your lot with mine, and I'll make a rich man out of you.
In the Hawk we can travel all over this continent, from
Hudson Bay to Patagonia. Where men never went before,
we can go. No mountain range is so high that we
can't cross it, and no desert is so barren that we can't
wing our way comfortably over it."</p>

<p>Matt stared at the dark figure in the chair. If any
honest man had talked to him in that way, the young
motorist would have been tempted to become an aeronaut,
for he could see plainly the possibilities of a serviceable
air-ship; but as for Brady, he was a criminal, and that
cut him off from any consideration on Matt's part.</p>

<p>The young motorist sank down on his knees and looked
over the side of the car. They were perhaps a thousand
feet in the air. Houses, villages, dark expanses of timber
and lighter stretches of meadow swept past them, moving
out from under the car like a dark panorama.</p>

<p>Driving an automobile at speed was like flying, but
here was flying itself. The new sensation gripped Matt
and thrilled him in every nerve.</p>

<p>"How are we heading, Pete?" called Brady.</p>

<p>Pete was leaning over the opposite side of the car,
looking forward.</p>

<p>"I'm jest tryin' to git my bearin's, Brady," he answered.
"It's so pesky dark it's hard to make out jest
where we are."</p>

<p>Matt stole a look at Pete's back. The hand gripping
the revolver lay on the rail. By one quick move Matt
could have snatched the weapon. As the idea swept
through his mind he cautiously changed his position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then a soft hand rested on his and he saw the
girl's face pressed close.</p>

<p>"Don't do anything desperate!" she whispered, imploringly.
"Do whatever dad says&mdash;it will be better for
you. When we get to where we're going, I'll help you
escape, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think, Brady," called Pete, "that ye're still too fur
to the north. Better shift a leetle more to the left. I
won't be sartin, though, that I'm right."</p>

<p>"I ought to be there on the lookout," answered Brady.
"Come here, King, and take the engine."</p>

<p>The girl's words had influenced Matt powerfully. On
top of that was the alluring prospect of handling a new
machine.</p>

<p>"I'll take the engine for a while, Brady," said he, getting
up, "but you're to remember I'll not hire out to
you."</p>

<p>"All I ask is for you to handle the motor," replied
Brady. "You'll come to your oats quick enough, I'll
gamble on that. You watch King, Pete," he added to
the other man, "and make sure he sends the Hawk where
I tell him to. If he tries to send her anywhere else,
you know what to do."</p>

<p>"That's no josh," answered Pete.</p>

<p>Brady left the chair and went forward. Matt dropped
into the vacant seat and began studying the various levers
with his groping hands.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">WILLOUGHBY'S SWAMP.</p>


<p>Pete kept his weapon prominently displayed, and
through the gloom Matt could see the ruffian's arm partly
lifted as though ready on the instant to bring the firearm
into use. This alert attitude on Pete's part, however,
was more for show than for anything else&mdash;at least,
Matt so regarded it. Brady was not anxious to go to
desperate extremes with Matt, especially since he wanted
him as driver for the air-ship.</p>

<p>Brady, taking up a position where he could peer ahead,
was scanning the dim landscape sharply.</p>

<p>"Swing her to the left!" he called.</p>

<p>Matt instantly applied the steering lever. Instead of
swinging to the left, however, the Hawk made a half-turn
to the right.</p>

<p>Up came the revolver. With a sharp cry, the girl
reached up and caught Pete's arm.</p>

<p>"To the <i>left</i>, I said!" roared Brady.</p>

<p>"You'll have to give me the chance to learn the machine,"
answered Matt, coolly, as he continued working
the lever and brought the Hawk around to the proper
course. "These levers are new to me. When we steer
an auto we do it with a wheel."</p>

<p>"I thought ye knowed all about motors," jeered Pete.</p>

<p>"I know something about motors," replied Matt, "but
not the first thing about air-ships."</p>

<p>As near as Matt could judge, they were proceeding at
a speed of something like thirty miles an hour. He
speeded up the engine a little and was surprised at the
smoothness with which it worked. The propeller hummed
in a low, husky drone that was quite different from the
song of the cylinders.</p>

<p>He moved the steering lever backward a couple of
notches. Immediately the rudder was tilted and the
Hawk began to climb upward.</p>

<p>"Stop that!" yelled Brady. "We're high enough.
What are you trying to do?"</p>

<p>"Learning the machine," answered Matt, and threw the
lever forward.</p>

<p>The front end of the gas-bag tipped downward, and
the air-ship slid toward the earth with a suddenness that
almost threw Brady over the rail.</p>

<p>"That'll do you!" he whooped. "Get her on a level
again, and be quick about it. You can handle the machine,
all right, and I don't want you to do anything but
what you're told."</p>

<p>"All right," said Matt quietly.</p>

<p>For five minutes longer they continued to swim onward
through the air. A long string of lights shot across
the gloomy landscape below them, and a whistle came
upward from the earth with startling distinctness.</p>

<p>"There goes a train, whistlin' fer Lake Station," remarked
Pete.</p>

<p>"We'll be over the town in a minute," said Brady, "and
then it won't be long until we get to the swamp."</p>

<p>"What swamp?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Never ye mind," was Pete's surly rejoinder. "Ye're
here to obey orders an' not ask any fool questions."</p>

<p>"I don't think it very foolish for a fellow to ask where
he's being taken."</p>

<p>"Mebby not, but ye ain't findin' anythin' out, see?"</p>

<p>Matt had been doing a good deal of guessing about
Carl. What would his chum do? What was he doing
then? He felt pretty sure that Carl would get into the
house and go through it from cellar to roof.</p>

<p>But Matt knew that Carl had a good sensible head in
cases of emergency. Now and again the Dutch boy's
temper was apt to make trouble with his reasoning, but
in the long run Carl could always be counted on to do
the right thing.</p>

<p>So Matt was not worrying very much about his chum.
Carl would take good care of the blue prints and ultimately
they would find their rightful owner.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Brady, suddenly, "there's the signal!
I'll go back and take charge of the motor while we make
the landing, Pete, and you take the lookout."</p>

<p>Matt gave place to Brady and then stood at the rail,
watching developments curiously.</p>

<p>Below the air-ship was a great splotch of black shadow,
stretching away on all sides as far as the eye could reach.
Evidently this was the swamp. The Hawk was sailing
across the swamp toward a big fire that glowed in the
distance.</p>

<p>With Brady steering and Pete directing, the Hawk approached
closer and closer to the fire.</p>

<p>"Drop 'er, Brady!" Pete presently called; "we're close
on the island."</p>

<p>The nose of the air-ship ducked downward and, for
perhaps twenty seconds, she raced earthward; then Brady
diminished the speed of their descent by slow degrees.</p>

<p>Matt, braced on the sloping floor of the car, watched
the fire apparently come up toward them. A little later
he was able to make out three human figures against the
firelit background below, and a bare little plateau took
vague form under his eyes.</p>

<p>He watched the landing keenly, and noted how Brady
suddenly shifted the steering rudder so as to bring the
Hawk on an even keel, the lower supports of the car just
grazing the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The three figures by the fire ran close.</p>

<p>"How's everything, Brady?" cried a voice.</p>

<p>"Finer than silk," called back Brady. "Stand by to
catch the ropes, you fellows."</p>

<p>The murmur of the motor ceased, the revolving propeller
came to a stop, and Pete flung out two ropes, one
on each side of the car.</p>

<p>The ropes were caught by the men on the ground, a
bight of each was thrown around a stout stake driven
into the earth at an angle, and the air-ship was drawn
down and safely moored.</p>

<p>Matt was now able to understand why Brady had taken
his place as driver for the landing. Not only was the
method of making a landing new to Matt, but there was
also danger, unless one was familiar with the place, of
scraping the trees that covered the swamp and hemmed
in the cleared space called the "island."</p>

<p>Matt started to spring over the rail of the car.</p>

<p>"Stop, King!" cried Brady. "You don't want to make
a bolt for the timber and get mired in the swamp, do
you? Just remember you're still under orders. Take
him to the roost, Needham, you and Whipple. Better tie
him up until he gets used to the place and to our society.
He's a bit strange, here, and none too willing
to stay."</p>

<p>"Did you bring the loot, Brady?" called one of the
men.</p>

<p>"Sure! This is moving-day with us and you didn't
think I was going to leave all that stuff on Hoyne Street,
did you? Get out of the car, King," he went on, to Matt.
"Whipple and Needham will take care of you."</p>

<p>Two of the three men had stepped to the side of the
car. In the light of the fire, which was blazing at a safe
distance from the air-ship, Matt discovered that Needham
and Grove had been the two aeronauts who had had
such hard luck with the Hawk during the preceding
day.</p>

<p>Needham, who, with Whipple, was facing Matt and
waiting for him to get over the air-ship's rail, gave a
husky laugh.</p>

<p>"We got out of that scrape, all right," said he, "even if
we did lose our drag-rope."</p>

<p>"And you got me into another scrape," said Matt.
"You fellows will pay for this!"</p>

<p>"Chirp low, young feller," warned Whipple, catching
him by the arm as he gained the ground; "your cue is to
make friends with us an' not bluster about what ye're
goin' ter do. There's five husky men here, an' we're all
surrounded by a swamp that would mire ye up ter the
eyes if ye tried ter git through it. Oh, I reckon ye won't
git away ter make any of us pay fer anythin'! This
way, an' step lively."</p>

<p>With Needham and Whipple on each side of him and
hanging to an arm, Matt was led across the open space,
past the fire, and to the door of a small, roughly built
shanty. A little way off there was another building, fully
as small but apparently somewhat better built.</p>

<p>"This here's the roost," announced Whipple, "an' it's
where ye're ter pass the rest o' the night. Come in, an'
come peaceable."</p>

<p>It was part of Matt's plan, hastily formed on the air-ship
just after the girl had spoken to him, to accept passively
whatever came his way&mdash;at least for a time. The
girl had said that she would help him escape, and there
was that about her which had awakened his confidence.
Not only that, but there was also something in the girl's
face that had aroused his sympathy. She had a history,
he was sure, and one that was far from pleasant.</p>

<p>There were five cots in the "roost," and Matt was told
to lie down on one of them.</p>

<p>"Harper used to sleep there," remarked Needham, as
Matt stretched himself out on the hard bed, "and the
deuce only knows where poor old Harper is now. You're
taking his place, King, and so it's only right you should
have his cot."</p>

<p>It was on Matt's tongue to say that Needham had another
guess coming, but he held his peace. He would
not show too much of the hostile side of his feelings until
he had had a chance to talk with the girl.</p>

<p>"What's the use of tying me," expostulated Matt, as
ropes were being put in place around his wrists and
ankles, "if it's impossible for me to get away?"</p>

<p>"Orders," answered Whipple, curtly.</p>

<p>After Matt was made secure, Whipple and Needham
went out of the hut. The young motorist had had a trying
day, and even his exciting situation was powerless to
keep the sleep from his eyes. He dozed off, while his
thoughts were trying to straighten out the queer tangle
in which events had bound him. He roused up for a
moment when Pete, Whipple, Needham and Grove came
into the hut and dropped down on their cots, but almost
immediately he went to sleep again.</p>

<p>It seemed as though he had hardly closed his eyes the
second time before he was awakened by a light hand
pressed upon his forehead. The other cots in the room
were empty, it was morning, and the girl was standing
beside him.</p>

<p>"I have brought your breakfast," said she, in a low
voice. "We can talk a little, but will have to be quick.
Dad, or some of the men, may come in here at any second!
There's a lot that you've got to know, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the sharp explosion of a firearm
outside. Stifling a cry, she whirled from the cot and
ran to the open door.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A FOE IN THE AIR.</p>


<p>"What is it?" asked Matt, struggling up on the cot.</p>

<p>No revolver had caused the report he had heard. From
the sound he knew that a rifle had been fired.</p>

<p>A babel of excited voices now came to him from without,
accompanied by sounds of running feet diminishing
rapidly in the distance. Then came another report, and
another, both from a more distant point than the first.</p>

<p>The girl stepped through the doorway and was looking
upward.</p>

<p>"Take off these ropes!" called Matt. "Let me get out
there and see what is going on!"</p>

<p>The girl turned and reentered the hut. Her face wore
an expression of the utmost concern.</p>

<p>"No," said she, "I can't release you just now. If dad
was to come and find that I'd set you free, he would suspect
me at once and that would spoil my plans."</p>

<p>"But what was the cause of that shooting?" persisted
Matt.</p>

<p>"There's another air-ship over the island&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Another air-ship?" echoed Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes. It must be Jerrold's, although how he ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
found out where dad was is more than I know. Dad
and the rest were shooting at the air-ship with rifles."</p>

<p>"I'll bet it's somebody who's come looking for me!"
exclaimed Matt. "If your father and his gang should
kill anybody&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They won't," interrupted the girl, confidently; "dad
knows better than to do anything of that kind. They'll
try to put a bullet or two into the gas-bag of the air-ship
and frighten Jerrold away."</p>

<p>"Go and take another look," said Matt, anxiously. "See
what they're doing."</p>

<p>The girl glided to the doorway again.</p>

<p>"The other air-ship is moving off," the girl reported,
with a measure of relief in her voice, as she came back.
"I think the bullets must have injured the propeller, or
some of the machinery, for the air-ship is moving very
slowly and seems to be in trouble."</p>

<p>"Did you see how many were aboard?"</p>

<p>"There were three in the car&mdash;one of them was Jerrold,
and he was managing the motor."</p>

<p>"The other two," asked Matt, eagerly, "do you know
who they were?"</p>

<p>"One of them was in uniform, and looked like a policeman.
The other was short and thick-set and looked like
a German."</p>

<p>"Carl!" exclaimed Matt, jubilantly. "Good old Carl!
How did he ever find out where I was, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet dad is trying to guess the same thing," said
the girl. "He'll be badly cut up over this. But it's no
more than he ought to expect," she added. "Whenever
a man breaks the law he'll have to pay for it, sooner
or later."</p>

<p>"What has your father been doing?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I came to talk with you about that. While I'm giving
you your breakfast, I'll tell you my plans. Dad, and all
the rest except Whipple, are off in the swamp, somewhere,
keeping track of Jerrold's air-ship, and that will
give us a chance."</p>

<p>Matt swung his bound feet over the edge of the cot,
and while he sat there the girl drew a chair close and
began giving him his breakfast.</p>

<p>"Dad has been doing a lot of criminal things," said the
girl, "and all he built that air-ship for was to make it
easy for him to rob people and get away without being
found out. Didn't you guess that when I showed you
that article in the paper? I thought you might."</p>

<p>"I've been mighty thick-headed," answered Matt, between
mouthfuls, "and I never thought the thing through
that far. Possibly it's because so much has been happening
to me since I went into that place on Hoyne
Street."</p>

<p>"It's nearly broken my heart having dad act like he's
been doing," said the girl, her lips quivering. "If mother
had lived she'd have kept dad straight, but when she died
dad just seemed to go to the dogs. He has tried to
make the people in South Chicago think he was just an
honest inventor, but, even at that, he stole all his ideas
from Jerrold. That balloon house, that he built out of
some of the proceeds of his first robbery, was put up
for what they call a 'blind.' With a big house like that,
out in plain sight, dad felt that everybody would think
his work was open and aboveboard. When he committed
any robberies, the Hawk was taken from the
shed in the dead of night, and Harper would steer it for
the place they were to rob. The blackest kind of a night
was always selected, and only flat-topped buildings were
robbed. You see, the air-ship would alight on the roof,
and dad and the rest would break into the building from
the top. When they left they always went in the same
way they came, and the police were puzzled because they
could not find any clues in the lower part of the buildings."</p>

<p>"It was a slick scheme," commented Matt.</p>

<p>"That's the way Hartz &amp; Greer's place was robbed,"
proceeded the girl. "Dad and the rest got fifteen thousand
dollars' worth of goods from Hartz &amp; Greer, and
for more than a week the stuff has been hidden in that
house on Hoyne Street. But now dad has left South
Chicago for good and all. He's afraid the police are
beginning to suspect him, and that Jerrold might try to
do something on account of those stolen blue prints."</p>

<p>It was perfectly plain to Matt that the girl's recital
of these crimes, in which her father had played the
leading part, was anything but easy for her. She was
talking from a sense of duty, and Matt honored and admired
her for the stand she was taking.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible," said he, gently, "that Brady
is your father."</p>

<p>"But he is," she answered brokenly, "and he has
brought shame and disgrace on me. But what could I
do? Dad knows how I feel about his actions, and he has
watched me and kept me away from other people ever
since he began his stealing. When you came to the
house, last night, it was the first chance I have had to
tell what I know. I overheard dad and Pete planning
what they were going to do if you came, and&mdash;and I
hoped you would come, although I knew you would
never leave the house until you were taken away as dad's
prisoner. I felt sure, though, that I could help you to
escape, and I feel even more sure of that now than I
did before."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Matt, his eyes full on
the girl's face.</p>

<p>"Helen," she answered.</p>

<p>"What are your plans, Helen?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My plan," she went on, "is for you to get away from
the swamp in the Hawk, and to take the stuff stolen from
Hartz &amp; Greer with you. That will stop everything, for
dad will be perfectly helpless without the air-ship. Then,
too, you can return the stolen diamonds and jewelry to
Hartz &amp; Greer, and that will go far toward righting one
wrong. When you are back in South Chicago, you can
send the police here and&mdash;and they can capture dad
and the rest."</p>

<p>Matt had finished eating and the girl had put aside the
dishes. Suddenly she broke down and hid her face in
her apron. For a few moments she sobbed convulsively.</p>

<p>Small wonder her feelings overcame her! In carrying
out her ideas of right and justice, she had planned to
give her own father into the hands of the law.</p>

<p>"You're a noble girl, Helen!" declared Matt. "But
how am I to get away in the air-ship and to take the
stolen property with me?"</p>

<p>"You already know how to run the machine," said
the girl, recovering herself a little and looking up, "and
when the right time arrives I will come here and take
off your ropes. As for the stolen property, I will see to
it that that is put in the car before you start. There will
be danger in what you do, but, from what I have heard,
you know how to win out in spite of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will run any risk to get away from here," returned
Matt, gravely, "but when I go you must go with me.
This is no place for you&mdash;with such a thieving gang!"</p>

<p>"I must stay here," the girl said resolutely. "Even
though I am sending my father to prison I want to be
with him to the last. If something isn't done," she continued
passionately, "he will go on and on, constantly
from bad to worse, and perhaps some time"&mdash;her face
blanched as she spoke&mdash;"he might receive worse than a
prison sentence. It is the only way to save him."</p>

<p>It was clear that Helen Brady had spent much time in
thinking out and planning her present course, and how
much mental anguish and bitterness of spirit her conclusion
had cost her, only she could know.</p>

<p>"I am ready to do whatever you want me to," said
Matt, "and if you think it best to stay here, all right. I
still believe, though, you ought to leave this place with
me."</p>

<p>"No, no," she replied firmly. "I have thought it all out
a dozen times, and I have made up my mind as to what it
is right for me to do. You must get away from here
in the air-ship. With the Hawk taken away from him,
dad will be helpless."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any friends or relatives to whom you
could go?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I have relatives on my mother's side, but they won't
have anything to do with dad or me&mdash;simply because dad
is what he is. They have asked me to leave dad and
come to them, but I know my place and what it is right
for me to do."</p>

<p>A brief silence fell between the two, during which Matt
turned the queer problem over in his mind.</p>

<p>"When do you think your plan can be carried out?" he
asked presently.</p>

<p>"It has got to be soon, if at all," she answered. "I
don't know what effect this appearance of Jerrold's air-ship
over the swamp will have on dad, but I hope it won't
interfere with my plans. We'll have to wait a little while
and see. Whipple is watching the Hawk now, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just at that moment a heavy step was heard outside.
A man appeared in the doorway, stared in at Matt and
the girl for an instant, and then strode into the hut.</p>

<p>The man was Brady, and his face was black as a
thundercloud.</p>

<p>"What're you doing here so long?" he cried angrily to
the girl. "Clear out! I've got something I want to talk
over with King."</p>

<p>With a supplicating look at her father, the girl got up
and passed out of the hut.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BRADY CHANGES HIS PLANS.</p>


<p>"You've played the devil with me, and no mistake!"
scowled Brady, whirling on Matt the moment the girl
was gone.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you make that out," said Matt.
"You're the one that's made all the trouble, Brady."</p>

<p>Brady's little eyes glittered as they rested on Matt.
For a few moments he paced angrily back and forth
across the hut.</p>

<p>"How in thunder," he cried suddenly, "did Jerrold ever
manage to get a line on me? He was over the swamp,
a short time ago, with his air-ship, and he'd have landed
here if we hadn't driven him off. Jerrold knows where
I am, and he has the means of getting to the island.
We've crippled his craft, though, and he's had to haul off
for repairs. While he's gone, I've got to change my
plans, somehow, and be ready for him when he comes
back. That Dutch kid who was with you at the balloon
house yesterday was in the car of the air-ship, and there
was also a policeman along. How did that come?"</p>

<p>"You know as much about it as I do, Brady," replied
Matt. "I disappeared from that Hoyne Street house,
last night, and I suppose my chum has been getting clues
about me and following them up. That's the kind of a
lad he is."</p>

<p>"Where did he get any clues that would bring him out
here?"</p>

<p>"Give it up."</p>

<p>Brady took a few more turns across the room, presently
halting in front of Matt.</p>

<p>"You didn't bring that roll of blue prints to Hoyne
Street, last night," said he. "Where did you leave it?"</p>

<p>"Left it out in front of the house," grinned Matt.</p>

<p>Brady started.</p>

<p>"In front of the house?" he echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Cached?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Under the sidewalk?"</p>

<p>"No; in the pocket of my Dutch pard."</p>

<p>Brady stared incredulously. Then he swore.</p>

<p>"That Dutchman was out in front all the while you
were in the house?"</p>

<p>Matt nodded.</p>

<p>"He came with me from Chicago. I got to thinking
there might be a trap in the house, and that some one
was there who wanted the blue prints, so I made up my
mind that it would be a wise move to leave Carl out in
front, and to let him keep the roll."</p>

<p>"That chum of yours must have seen the Hawk when
she climbed out of the back yard," growled Brady, "but
how in the fiend's name was he able to get Jerrold and
the Eagle and follow us? It was dark, and we had a
long start of them."</p>

<p>"One guess is as good as another," said Matt, calmly.
"I told you you'd get yourself into trouble if you tried
to make a prisoner of me. The best thing you can do
now is to send me back to South Chicago in the air-ship."</p>

<p>"Think I'm a fool?" snarled Brady. "It may be that
you're all that stands between me and my men and capture.
I'll hang onto you, King, and I'll let that Dutch
pard of yours know that if Jerrold don't keep away from
this swamp with his air-ship you're going to connect with
your finish. It's neck or nothing with me, now, and I'll
go any length to keep myself out of the 'pen.' I've laid
out a fine campaign for the Hawk, and I don't intend to
have all my plans nipped in the bud, right at the start-off."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Matt, scathingly, "that your campaign
is one of robbery, and that you're going to make a
pirate ship out of the Hawk?"</p>

<p>"That's where you put your finger on the right button!"
declared Brady. "I'm going to be a freebooter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
and take my toll wherever I can find it. It's easy to
swoop down on a lot of spoil, pick it up and make off
with it. And what can the law do?" He laughed
mockingly. "Policemen will have to have wings to get
anywhere near me."</p>

<p>"And that's what you wanted me for, is it?" cried Matt,
indignantly; "to drive the Hawk around through the air
and help out your villainous plans! I would let you kill
me first."</p>

<p>"Rot! I'm going to stick to my original intentions, but
there's got to be something of a change in my immediate
plans. We've all got to pull out of here and to
take what plunder we've got cached in the swamp. The
Hawk will have to make three or four trips, and they
must be made before Jerrold and his air-ship can interfere
with us. If Jerrold fixes up his air-ship and comes
back, we'll just tell him what will happen to you if he
lingers in the vicinity of the swamp. I'm banking on
that to send him packing again, and to keep him out of
sight until I can make a change of base. You'll go away
on the Hawk's first trip, and it will probably be only half
an hour before you can start."</p>

<p>Brady started for the door, but halted before he reached
it and faced around.</p>

<p>"Either one of two things happened to put that Dutchman
and Jerrold on my track," said he. "Either Harper
has been caught, and has told what he knows, or else a
letter I gave Needham to deliver to Whipple, here in
the swamp, has fallen into the hands of the police. It
don't make much difference, though, how Jerrold got
next to our hang-out. The main thing is that he knows
where we are, and that you will be put in a mighty tight
corner if he keeps on trying to make trouble for me.
That's about all, King. I want you to understand what
you're up against and be ready for whatever happens.
I'm not going to have my plans knocked galley-west just
as I'm on the point of launching them."</p>

<p>With another black scowl, expressive of his savage determination,
Hector Brady strode out of the hut.</p>

<p>Matt was beginning to understand why Helen preferred
to see her father in prison rather than free to
carry out his campaign of lawlessness. Possessing a
practical air-ship like the Hawk, Brady could commit
untold depredations and snap his fingers in open defiance
of the law.</p>

<p>The young motorist shuddered to think of the scoundrel's
comprehensive plans, and of the part he had intended
to make his prisoner play in them.</p>

<p>Helen's reasoning was logical, and the expedient she
had suggested was as simple as it was effective. By
taking the Hawk away from Brady she would make it
impossible for him to follow out his nefarious schemes.
The beautiful simplicity of the countercheck aroused
Matt's admiration.</p>

<p>But how was the countercheck to be brought about?
The appearance of Jerrold's air-ship over the swamp had
made doubly difficult the work the girl was counting
upon having done. Not only that, but the coming of the
Eagle had increased Matt's peril. There was no doubt
in the young motorist's mind but that Brady would go to
any extreme in order to keep himself and his companions
from being captured.</p>

<p>All these different aspects of the situation floated
through Motor Matt's mind swiftly. Two or three minutes
after Brady had left the hut, and while Matt was
still considering the problem that confronted the girl,
Helen herself stole in through the door.</p>

<p>Her face was haggard, but her eyes were bright and
full of resolution.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be here," protested Matt. "Your father
suspected something when he found you with me a little
while ago and ordered you away. What if he should
come back and see you here again?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll come back, but I've got to take the
risk, even if he does." The girl spoke quickly and steadily
and made her way swiftly to Matt's side. "Dad has
changed his plans&mdash;I was listening to all he said, out
there at the back of the hut. He's going to use the
Hawk to take us all away from the swamp, and <i>you're
going to go on the Hawk's first trip</i>! That means that
we must do what we can, at once. If we fail now, everything
is lost."</p>

<p>She was breathlessly eager, but her calmness at such a
moment surprised Matt. Lifting her hands she took a
small poniard from the bosom of her dress, bent down
and severed the cords that secured Matt's hands. Then,
with one downward stroke of the keen blade, she freed
his feet.</p>

<p>"Where are your father and the rest of the men?"
asked Matt.</p>

<p>Before she answered, Helen glided to the door and took
a cautious look outside.</p>

<p>"Some of the stolen goods have been hidden among
the bushes of the swamp," said she, returning to Matt.
"You are to be sent away with the loot, on the first
trip, and dad himself will have to take you. He, and
everybody except Whipple, have gone to the swamp.
Whipple has a rifle and is guarding the Hawk. Whatever
we do, Matt, we've got to do in a hurry. The bag
of goods taken from Hartz &amp; Greer is behind this hut,"
she pointed to an unglazed opening in the rear wall as
she spoke. "While the rest are in the swamp, I will
go to the Hawk and talk with Whipple, getting around
on the other side of him so that his back will be in this
direction. While I am holding his attention, you will
creep up on him from behind and, between us, we will
try and get the rifle. It's a desperate chance, but we
will do the best we can."</p>

<p>"You're a brave girl, Helen!" declared Matt.</p>

<p>"I'm doing what I think is right, and that always helps
a person's courage. I'm more worried about you than I
am about myself. If anything should go wrong&mdash;if anything
should happen to you because of the help you are
giving me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>For the first time her voice faltered. Matt reached out
and caught her hand reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Don't fret about me," said he. "There won't be any
trouble about my getting the best of Whipple, with you
to help. Is the Hawk all ready for a flight? I mean is
there plenty of gasoline in the tank, and plenty of oil?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dad has seen to that. So far as the air-ship is
concerned, it is ready to carry you quickly and safely out
of the swamp. Now I will steal out of the hut and talk
with Whipple."</p>

<p>Once more she started for the door. Hardly had she
reached it, however, when she drew back with a gasp of
consternation. Turning, she beckoned to Matt.</p>

<p>"Too late!" she whispered, her voice sharp with anguish
and disappointment. "Oh, why have they come
just at this time!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt glided quickly to her side and peered out through
the half-opened door.</p>

<p>What he saw was well calculated to discourage him
and the girl.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">INTO THE SWAMP.</p>


<p>Needham, Pete, Grove and Brady had not been long
carrying out their work of recovering the cached goods.
They were returning from the edge of the bushy timber,
ascending the slight elevation of the "island" on their
way to the Hawk, each bearing an armful of plunder.</p>

<p>In his stealings, Brady had not bothered with bulky
articles but had confined himself to "lifting" smaller and
richer loot. The stuff was all in small sacks.</p>

<p>As the men walked past the "roost" on their course to
the air-ship, Matt and the girl withdrew from the door
to avoid being seen. Through a crack in the wall, however,
they were able to keep close track of what went on.</p>

<p>On reaching the Hawk, the bundles were deposited on
the ground. Whipple, leaning on his rifle, stood watching
while the bags were heaped up at the side of the
air-ship.</p>

<p>For a few moments the villainous crew had their heads
together in close and earnest conversation. Now and
again their eyes were lifted aloft, evidently on the alert
for some sign of the Eagle. Brady, it could be seen,
did most of the talking. Suddenly, after a sharp scrutiny
overhead, Brady whirled around and started for the hut.</p>

<p>"He's coming after you!" half sobbed the girl.</p>

<p>"What's the reason I can't escape through that window
in the rear wall," asked Matt, hurriedly, "and take refuge
in the swamp?"</p>

<p>The idea seemed to electrify the girl.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that," she whispered, catching his
arm and starting for the window. "The back of the hut
is close to the trees and bushes on this side of the island,
and I know something about the reefs of dry ground
running through the swamp in the vicinity of this place.
Come!" she added; "we must hurry."</p>

<p>Her despair had vanished in a flash, and her steadiness
and resolution had all come back. She climbed through
the window and, as Matt followed, she was picking up a
small bag that had stood close to the rear wall.</p>

<p>Without speaking, and once more clasping his arm, she
hurried him into the tangled bushes that came up to
within a few feet of the hut. There, screened by a dense
thicket, they paused to note further developments.</p>

<p>Their position, of course, rendered it impossible for
them to see the front of the hut, but they were so close
they could hear Brady's oath of astonishment and alarm
when he discovered that Matt was missing.</p>

<p>The next moment Brady could be seen rushing around
the side of the hut and a little way in the direction of
the group standing beside the Hawk.</p>

<p>"He's gone!" roared Brady. "The cub's got loose and
skipped!"</p>

<p>The rest were roused into frantic activity.</p>

<p>"I'll sw'ar he didn't git out while I was watchin' the
Hawk," cried Whipple. "Anyways, he can't be fur off."</p>

<p>"Hustle around!" fumed Brady. "Get into the swamp,
every man-jack of you, and find that whelp wherever he
is. I wouldn't have him get clear for a thousand, cold!"
All the gang forthwith became exceedingly busy. They
darted off in various directions, and Brady himself, accompanied
by Grove, started for the side of the island
from which Matt and the girl were watching.</p>

<p>"We'll have to get away from here!" breathed the girl,
turning. "Follow me, Matt, and be careful where you
step. If you're not careful, you may find yourself mired
in the swamp."</p>

<p>"Trust me for that," answered Matt. "I'll carry this,"
he added, taking the bag from the girl's hands.</p>

<p>The swamp, into which they were now headed, presented
a matted tangle of undergrowth growing among
the trees. Through the bushes could be seen a glimmer
of stagnant water, and the whole place seemed as dank
and loathsome as a tropical jungle.</p>

<p>The girl picked her way carefully, parting the bushes
ahead of her and stepping from hummock to hummock.
Finally they reached a little bare uplift of dry earth, and
halted to listen. They could hear nothing of pursuit, and
the girl drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>"Dad don't know that I've explored this swamp," said
she. "I have lived on the island for nearly six months&mdash;dad
used to keep me here while he was doing his thieving
in South Chicago, so I wouldn't be able to tell what I
know and give him away, I guess."</p>

<p>She sank down on the flat piece of turf for a few moments'
rest. The ground, although dry, shivered under
them as they moved, and seemed every moment as though
about to give way beneath their weight and let them down
into the morass.</p>

<p>"This is a treacherous-looking place," remarked Matt,
peering off into the trees and bushes that hemmed them
in on every side.</p>

<p>"It's all of that," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"It would be easy for a person to get lost."</p>

<p>"Not easy for me, as I know it too well."</p>

<p>"If I can get away in the Hawk," went on Matt, after
a brief silence, "this will make it necessary for you to
go with me."</p>

<p>"Why?" she queried, lifting her wide, dark eyes to
his.</p>

<p>"Can't you understand? Your father and his men will
discover that you are not on the island, and they will
suspect that you helped me out of the hut. What will
your father do when he finds that out?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>A shiver swept through the girl's slight form.</p>

<p>"I suppose he will half kill me," she answered. "But
I shall stay with him. I am his daughter, and it's my
duty to be with him to the end."</p>

<p>"You mustn't be foolish," said Matt, inclined to get
out of patience. "You're carrying your idea of duty to
your father altogether too far."</p>

<p>"I've thought it all out," she answered firmly, "and
my mind is made up. Please don't try to argue with
me. It may not be possible for you to get away in the
air-ship now," she added, with a sigh of regret. "If you
can't, I will try and get you through the swamp. I don't
know anything about it, though, after we get a little
away from the island."</p>

<p>"Then," proceeded Matt, not giving up his argument
that Helen Brady should go away with him, "your father
will be madder than ever when he finds out you have
taken the goods stolen from Hartz &amp; Greer."</p>

<p>"That's what I expect, but it's right that the stuff
should be returned. A person ought to have principles,
Matt, and I don't think a person amounts to much if he
or she can't stand a little suffering on account of their
principles."</p>

<p>"That's right, too," muttered Matt.</p>

<p>"There's fifteen thousand dollars' worth of diamonds
and jewelry in that bag," Helen went on, "and Hartz &amp;
Greer have offered a reward of twenty-five hundred to
any one who will return the property."</p>

<p>"That money will go to you," said Matt, promptly.
"It's right that it should. Look at the risks you're taking
to have it put into the hands of its rightful owners
again! Some time, Helen, you will be rid of your father,
and then the money will come handy."</p>

<p>She was gazing at him steadily, and there was something
of rebuke in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that, Matt," said she, quietly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Would it be right for me to take a reward for returning
property my own father had stolen?"</p>

<p>Matt was amazed by the simple directness of the girl's
reasoning. And she was right, entirely right. Nevertheless
it took one of fine character to reason and to
act as the girl was doing.</p>

<p>"If you succeed in getting away with the bag," Helen
continued, "I want you to give it back to the rightful
owners. Tell them it comes from Hector Brady's daughter,
and that she hopes they will not be too hard on her
father."</p>

<p>"You bet I'll tell them," said Matt. "What's more, I'll
get through this swamp on foot, if I have to, and I'll
consider it a mighty fine thing to lug the bag along and
turn it over to Hartz &amp; Greer."</p>

<p>"I felt sure you'd help me," murmured the girl. "There
was something in your face that told me you could be
depended on the moment I looked at you at the door of
that Hoyne Street house."</p>

<p>"Then the impression was mutual," said Matt. "If I
hadn't read honesty in your face, along with a desire to
help me, I'd have made a rush out of that room in the
Hoyne Street place the moment I read your warning on
the fly leaf of the book."</p>

<p>"It was well you didn't do that. You'd have been
caught. Pete was behind the window curtain all the
time. That was why I had to write what I wanted you
to know, and call your attention to it indirectly. If you
had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl was interrupted by a distant rustle of bushes.
Stifling the words on her lips, she sprang erect.</p>

<p>"Dad's coming this way," she whispered. "I don't
think he has the least idea where we've gone, but he
seems to be blundering in the right direction. We'll have
to hurry on."</p>

<p>Once more they resumed their flight, Matt carrying
the bag and carefully following in his companion's footsteps.</p>

<p>The way became increasingly difficult, and the bushes
even denser than they had been at the point where they
had entered the swamp. Then, too, the hummocks which
offered them foothold became farther apart so that it was
necessary to leap almost blindly through the brush in
getting from one to another.</p>

<p>Occasionally they halted and listened, but were unable
to hear any sound behind them to indicate that Brady and
Grove were still on the right track.</p>

<p>Just as Matt was congratulating himself that they had
again eluded their pursuers, a cry from the girl, muffled
but full of distress, reached him.</p>

<p>Between him and her a screen of bushes intervened,
and the cry had come a moment after she had taken a
headlong plunge through the leafy tangle.</p>

<p>Not knowing what could have happened, and fearing
the worst, Matt shifted the bag to his other arm, drew
his leather cap well down over his forehead so that the
visor would protect his eyes, and leaped boldly after the
girl.</p>

<p>By good luck, rather than by any calculation on his
part, he landed on a shaking hummock, and found that
Helen had plunged into the watery morass.</p>

<p>Dropping the bag, he reached down, grasped her about
the waist and dragged her from the clutching grip of
the swamp.</p>

<p>"We'll have to go back," were the girl's first words, as
he held her on the narrow foothold.</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

<p>She waved her hand in the direction toward which they
were going.</p>

<p>An open space, clear of trees and bushes, lay before
them&mdash;a veritable quagmire with not a place in all its
extent where they could set their feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>They would have to go back! With Brady and Grove
on one side of them, and this impassable bog on the
other, it looked as though they had been caught between
two fires.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DESPERATE CHANCE.</p>


<p>Once more the girl was plunged into despair.</p>

<p>"We'll have to give up," she whispered, tearfully. "We
have tried hard, but luck is against us. For several
minutes we have been traveling over ground I know
nothing about. When I saw that open stretch of swamp,
my heart failed me and I fell off the firm ground. You
see what a horrible place this is, Matt!"</p>

<p>"Isn't there any way to get around to the other side of
the island?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, we could have done that, but I was trying to
take you as far as I could toward the other edge of the
swamp."</p>

<p>"We'll have to give that up, now, and work our way
around the island."</p>

<p>"In going back," faltered the girl, "we may meet dad
and Grove!"</p>

<p>"We must take the chance," he answered; "there's
nothing else for it."</p>

<p>"And in going around the island," proceeded the girl,
dejectedly, "we may meet some of the others who are
looking for us."</p>

<p>"That's another risk we will have to run. Come on,"
he continued, picking up the bag. "I'll lead the way
back."</p>

<p>"You've got a way about you," said Helen, "that gives
a person courage."</p>

<p>"A fellow would be a pretty poor stick," returned Matt,
"who couldn't keep his nerve with a girl like you to help
him."</p>

<p>Helen's dress was torn by the bushes, and her hands
and face were scratched and bleeding; but she seemed
to mind her physical discomforts very little, so eager was
she to have Matt's escape prove successful.</p>

<p>Listening intently for any sounds made by Brady and
Grove, Matt and the girl started back over the course
they had recently covered.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when the sounds they feared
came to them. As they stood together and listened, they
could hear Brady and Grove talking back and forth.
Their voices, and the crashing of the bushes, were growing
rapidly in volume, and proved that they were coming
closer.</p>

<p>The girl began to tremble. Matt pressed her hand reassuringly.
Off to the right of the course they had been
following his quick eye detected a foothold among the
matted bushes. He pointed it out to his companion.</p>

<p>"Get there, quick!" he whispered.</p>

<p>She leaped for the spot at once, and he was not slow
in following her. Then, crouching down, they peered
through the thicket.</p>

<p>Brady came jumping into sight, clutching a revolver in
his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm positive I heard something ahead, Grove!" he
cried.</p>

<p>"It must be King, then," answered Grove, floundering
along in the rear. "He's been makin' a better hike of it
through this blasted swamp than I ever thought he
could."</p>

<p>"There's an open stretch farther along," went on
Brady, grimly. "That'll stop him, and we'll have him
in a few minutes."</p>

<p>Brady leaped out of sight, and Grove likewise jumped
past and vanished.</p>

<p>The girl had scarcely breathed while the two men were
so close to them.</p>

<p>"Now we've got a chance," whispered Matt. "While
they're going on toward that open part of the swamp,
we'll get back toward the island and double around it."</p>

<p>"We won't have to go far, now," rejoined the girl,
her hopes rising, "before we can turn to the right and
start around the island."</p>

<p>Matt continued to lead the way back, making the best
time he possibly could. When the girl called softly to
him, he stopped.</p>

<p>"Here's where we turn," said she. "I'd better go
ahead from now on."</p>

<p>He waited for her to gain his side, then followed as
she continued to make her way onward through the bewildering
tangle. Time and again Matt, if alone, would
have lost his bearings, but Helen, being on familiar
ground, was never for one moment at a loss.</p>

<p>Their one fear now was that they should encounter
some of the others who were searching, but they heard
nothing to cause them the slightest uneasiness.</p>

<p>At last, after half an hour of tiring work, Helen drew
to a halt.</p>

<p>"We're about opposite the place where the air-ship is
moored," said she.</p>

<p>"That's where we want to be," answered Matt. "Make
for the edge of the island, Helen, as close to the air-ship
as you can get."</p>

<p>Once more the girl started off. The bushes thinned
perceptibly as they came closer and closer to the solid
ground. This rendered the going easier, and it also enabled
Matt and the girl to make less noise in getting
through the undergrowth. In nearing the island they
redoubled their caution, and when they finally reached
a spot from which they could look out and take in the
situation in the vicinity of the "roost" and the air-ship,
they congratulated themselves on the care they had exercised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>They were not more than a dozen feet from the place
where the Hawk was secured.</p>

<p>Two rifles were leaning against the car, and two of the
men&mdash;Grove and Needham&mdash;were sitting on the ground,
occasionally looking aloft.</p>

<p>Brady, Whipple and Pete were no where in sight.</p>

<p>"We must have crippled that air-ship of Jerrold's pretty
badly," Needham was saying. "If King hadn't made
this delay for us, the Hawk would have been well away
on her first trip."</p>

<p>"That kid is a slippery customer," growled Grove.
"The old man is riled for fair over the way he's cuttin'
up."</p>

<p>"What's the use o' botherin' with him? The thing to
do is to cut out o' this an' leave King in the swamp."</p>

<p>"I reckon Brady'd do that, if it wasn't for the bag of
loot King seems to have taken along with him."</p>

<p>Both men had thrown off their hats, and Grove was
nursing a number of scratches on his face and hands.</p>

<p>"We had a rough time of it," said he, "an' the old
man sent me back to find out if any of the rest had had
any success. If King had been found, I was to fire a
signal-shot with one of the rifles."</p>

<p>"Hang the luck, anyhow!" snorted Needham. "It was
the worst thing Brady ever done when he tangled up
with King. The lad has a will of his own, an' I knew
well enough he'd never take hold an' help us out runnin'
the motor."</p>

<p>"King has got more backbone than any fellow of his
age I ever saw, and that's a fact. The girl must have
helped him. And that's another place where Brady has
been lame, all along. He ought to have sent the girl
away, somewhere. She hasn't got any business hanging
out with a gang like this."</p>

<p>While Matt had been watching and listening, he had
been turning over several plans in his mind. Here was a
chance, albeit a desperate one, for getting hold of the
air-ship.</p>

<p>He turned to the girl.</p>

<p>"Helen," he whispered, "I'm going to see if I can't
capture the Hawk."</p>

<p>"You can't," she returned, fearfully. "Grove and
Needham are armed and&mdash;and they'll shoot."</p>

<p>"They can't shoot if I get hold of those rifles first,"
went on Matt, still speaking in guarded tones.</p>

<p>"How will you do that?"</p>

<p>"Their backs are toward us. I'll creep as close to the
Hawk as I can, then, if they hear me, as they probably
will, I'll make a rush for the guns."</p>

<p>The girl was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"There's nothing else to be done," she whispered, at
last. "Count on me, Matt, to do whatever I can to help."</p>

<p>"You keep back, Helen," he counseled. "If I succeed
in getting the guns, I won't need your help; if I don't,
your help would do little good. Here I go."</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously Matt crept out of the bushes.
The car of the air-ship was between him and the men,
and this served to screen him, up to a certain point;
but the two rifles were leaning against the opposite side
of the car, and in order to lay hold of them he would
either have to go around the long framework, or else
cross the car. He made up his mind to take the latter
course.</p>

<p>Without being discovered, he managed to reach the side
of the car; then, just as he was rising to step over the
rail, Needham caught sight of him.</p>

<p>With a wild yell Needham gained his feet. The yell
brought Grove up like a shot. For an instant, the two
rascals were paralyzed by the unexpected appearance of
Matt. Their moment of inaction afforded the young
motorist just the opportunity he needed.</p>

<p>Flinging himself into the car, and across it, he snatched
the rifles away from the rail, just as the hands of Grove
and Needham were outstretched to take them.</p>

<p>One of the weapons he flung behind him.</p>

<p>"Nail him!" cried Grove; "down him, before he gets
a chance to shoot!"</p>

<p>Needham, no less than Grove, realized the necessity of
capturing Matt. Matt, however, had no intention of
using the remaining rifle on either of the two men;
neither did he have it in mind to let them get away, or
rough-handle him.</p>

<p>As the two rushed forward, Matt flung the rifle to his
shoulder, and his gray eye sparkled menacingly along the
barrel.</p>

<p>"Keep off!" he warned, swaying the muzzle of the gun
back and forth so as to keep both men under it; "keep
away from me and stand right where you are! I mean
business, right from the drop of the hat, and you fellows
might as well understand it."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A DARING ESCAPE.</p>


<p>The menace of the steady gray eye and the swaying
gun muzzle were enough for Grove and Needham.</p>

<p>"Here's a go!" growled Needham, casting a yearning
look around him toward the timber.</p>

<p>"I'm going to make a 'go' of it, all right," averred
Matt, grimly, "no two ways about that. What are you
doing with your right hand, Needham?"</p>

<p>Needham's hand had wandered toward his hip. Matt
was watching both scoundrels so sharply that not a
move they made escaped him.</p>

<p>Needham brought his hand around in front of him.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do, King?" queried Grove,
evidently seeking to gain time and give Brady, Pete or
Whipple a chance to come on the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm trying to get away from this place," replied Matt,
"and I've not much time to waste in talk. I guess you
know that fully as well as I do."</p>

<p>Still keeping the rifle trained on the two men, he
climbed out of the car to the ground.</p>

<p>"Now," he went on, "I'll tell you fellows what you're
to do, and then we'll be able to work quicker. You will
both get into the car, and get in together so that I can
cover you more easily with this one gun. Needham will
then place his back against the upright timber that helps
suspend the car from the hoop&mdash;and mind you take the
timber farthest from the driver's seat. On the bottom
of the car there's a coil of small rope. With that, Grove
will tie Needham to the upright. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Why, what the blazes&mdash;&mdash;" began Grove, but Matt
cut him short.</p>

<p>"There's no time for talk, I tell you!" he called,
sharply. "Brady and the other two may show up here,
and I'm going to have this work done before that happens."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get into the car!"</p>

<p>Matt's finger flexed ever so slightly upon the trigger
of the gun. The watchful eyes of Grove and Needham
detected the movement and both made haste to tumble
into the car.</p>

<p>"I'd give a farm to know what you've got up your
sleeve," growled Needham, as he backed slowly against
the upright timber.</p>

<p>"Move more quickly," warned Matt, "or you'll find
what I've got in this gun. I used to be in Arizona, and
I know how they deal with matters of this sort down
there. They're not in the habit of wasting so many
words as I'm doing. Pick up that rope, Grove," he
added, "and get busy with it. Mind you tie hard knots!
No fast-and-loose plays at this stage of the game."</p>

<p>Grove was a bit languid in his operations, and as he
worked he gave more attention to the quarters from
which Brady, Pete and Whipple might be expected than
he did to the tying of Needham.</p>

<p>"Grove," called Matt, sternly, "I'm not going to bother
much more with you! Move faster, and pass some of
that rope around Needham's arms. I don't want his
hands left free. Pull the coils tighter."</p>

<p>After a fashion, Grove got his comrade tied.</p>

<p>"Will that do you?" he demanded, gruffly, turning to
glare at Matt.</p>

<p>"That will answer. Now turn your back to Needham's."</p>

<p>"Say, by thunder I'm not going to stand for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Turn your back!</i>"</p>

<p>Matt shoved the muzzle of the rifle toward Grove's
breast, and the man made haste to place himself against
the upright piece of the car's framework.</p>

<p>It was Matt's intention, then, to drop the rifle and
proceed with the tying of Grove himself, but the girl
suddenly appeared and climbed into the car.</p>

<p>"I'll do the rest, Matt," said she, picking up the loose
end of the rope.</p>

<p>Matt had planned to have the girl remain in the thicket,
taking no part in his operations; but she had different
ideas.</p>

<p>Grove and Needham both glared at the girl.</p>

<p>"The old man will make you sorry for this!" fumed
Grove.</p>

<p>"I expect he will," replied the girl. "He has made
me sorry for a lot of things lately."</p>

<p>Around and around the bodies of the two men Helen
coiled the rope. Then, when she had come to the end
of it, she made it fast with a knot.</p>

<p>Pausing a moment after she had finished, she drew a
revolver out of Needham's hip-pocket and dropped it on
the driver's seat.</p>

<p>"You had better have that in your own hands, Matt,"
said she, quietly. "It will be easier to handle than the
rifle."</p>

<p>"Don't get out of the car, Helen," called Matt, as the
girl was about to climb over the rail. "You can't stay
here after this."</p>

<p>"I can and I must."</p>

<p>Her resolve to remain with her father was unshaken;
but there was a bright light in her eyes which Matt had
not seen there before. Evidently the success that was
attending Matt's plans to get away with the air-ship had
lifted a grievous load from her spirits.</p>

<p>Walking around the car, Helen picked up the bag
which they had taken with them into the swamp.</p>

<p>"This must go with you, Matt," she continued, pushing
the bag under the driver's seat, "along with the rest of
the stuff piled up on the ground there."</p>

<p>While she was on that side of the car she cast off the
mooring-rope and flung it into the air-ship.</p>

<p>Matt dropped the rifle and released the rope on the
other side.</p>

<p>The Hawk was now in readiness to take to flight. With
nothing to hold it, the gas-bag began to feel the effects
of the wind that was blowing and to move about in answer
to the faint gusts. But it rode on an even keel, for
its buoyancy had to be accelerated by the propeller before
it would rise, or could be maneuvered.</p>

<p>The girl had started toward the bags, heaped up on the
ground. Before she could reach them, however, a loud
yell from the opposite side of the island caused her to
halt in consternation.</p>

<p>"Dad!" she cried, wildly; "he's coming!"</p>

<p>"Brady! This way, quick!"</p>

<p>The clamoring whoops went up from Needham and
Grove as they struggled fiercely to free themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt, seeing that there was not an instant to be lost,
leaped into the car and tilted the steering-rudder at an
angle which would carry the air-ship upward.</p>

<p>"Come along!" he shouted to the girl as he started the
engine. "Get into the car, Helen!"</p>

<p>"Hurry, hurry!" screamed the girl, running directly
away from the car and in the direction of Brady and
Pete, who were making for the Hawk at a run.</p>

<p>A pang of regret ran through Matt at the thought of
leaving Helen Brady behind to bear the brunt of her
father's anger; but there was no time for argument. He
started the propeller, and the Hawk began to move up
the airy incline toward the tops of the trees that walled
in the edge of the "island."</p>

<p>The struggles of Matt's two prisoners became desperately
frantic. So violently did they wrestle with their
bonds that the car tipped and swayed dangerously. Matt
had no time to give to them, just then, being wholly
wrapped up in the maneuvering of the Hawk.</p>

<p>He gave the rudder a further tilt, throwing the air-ship
to an angle that caused Grove's feet to slip from
under him, so that only the support of the rope and the
upright held him to his place.</p>

<p>"Shoot!" he bellowed. "Why don't you blaze away at
him, Brady?"</p>

<p>Brady had evidently held his fire, hoping to get the
air-ship back without injury; and, even now, as his rifle
and Pete's began to crack murderously, the target of
their bullets was Matt.</p>

<p>Two or three of the leaden spheres zipped past Matt's
head, missing him by the narrowest of margins.
Strangely enough, however, Matt was more worried
about the harm the bullets might do the gas-bag, or the
machinery, than he was about any damage they might
do him.</p>

<p>Faster and faster he speeded up the engine, and the
Hawk raced toward the clouds. She cleared the tops of
the trees, gained the clear sky, and, at a height of five
hundred feet, was brought to an even keel.</p>

<p>Then, and not till then, did Matt venture a look below.
He was just in time to catch one fleeting glimpse of those
he had left behind on the "island." What he saw aroused
his anger and indignation.</p>

<p>Helen, still true to her resolve to help Matt, had seized
hold of her father's rifle and was struggling to keep him
from using it. The minute figures were strangely clear,
and Matt saw Brady lift his fist and strike the girl down.
Then the tops of the trees interposed and cut off the unpleasant
sight. Matt faced about, a steely glint in his
gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Here's a fine lay out!" Grove was clamoring, far gone
with chagrin and baffled rage. "One kid, single-handed,
captures two of us and runs off with the air-ship, right
under the noses of Brady and the rest! Oh, well, we're
entitled to all we get out of this. We don't deserve anything
better."</p>

<p>"You'll get something more than you expect," said
Matt, picking up the revolver and pushing it into his
pocket, "if you don't stop squirming around like that.
It's hard to steer when you're rocking the car in such a
fashion. You fellows are my prisoners, so make the best
of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," growled Grove, "and us two aeronauts will have
a fine tale to tell when you take us where you're going
to. You've stolen this car. That'll cook your goose for
you."</p>

<p>"Brady," answered Matt, "can have his air-ship back
whenever he wants to show up and claim it."</p>

<p>There followed a brief silence, during which Matt
noted that the wind was brisk, and from the north, and
exulted over the speed the Hawk developed in the teeth
of it.</p>

<p>Needham was first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"If I had my hat, and was able," said he, craning his
head around to get a look at Matt, "I'd take it off to you."</p>

<p>The lad in the driver's seat made no response. He
was hurrying toward South Chicago.</p>

<p>Where was the Eagle? The skies in every direction
were clear and the other air-ship was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Motor Matt, as he drove the air-ship steadily against
the wind, kept close watch of the captured aeronauts.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE END OF THE MID-AIR TRAIL.</p>


<p>The failure of Carl, Harris and Jerrold to make a
landing on the "island" has already been recorded.</p>

<p>They had seen the Hawk, moored at one edge of the
cleared space, and they had seen Brady and the others;
but, of course, it had been impossible for them to see
anything of Matt. The young motorist, at that time, was
bound hand and foot and lying on the cot in the hut.</p>

<p>With bullets flying around them and threatening injury
to the Eagle, it was not policy to remain hovering
over such a nest of desperate scoundrels very long.</p>

<p>"We'll get out of here," cried Harris, angrily, "and
come back with men and guns enough to give those fellows
a taste of their own medicine. Don't let any harm
come to the air-ship, Jerrold. We're going to need her,
later."</p>

<p>Just as Harris finished speaking, a bullet slapped into
the motor and the machinery at once began to go wrong.</p>

<p>"Too late," responded Jerrold grimly; "they've already
nipped us."</p>

<p>"Py chimineddy," roared Carl, "I vish I hat somet'ing
vat I could shoot mit ad dem fillains!"</p>

<p>Limping and staggering, Jerrold managed to urge the
Eagle out of harm's way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"She won't drop on us, will she?" asked Harris, looking
anxiously downward at the tree-tops.</p>

<p>"No," replied Jerrold, "the gas-bag is uninjured, so we
can't fall; and the motor is working, too, after a fashion,
and that enables us to make a slow rate of speed. But
there will have to be some repairs before we can do anything
more with the air-ship."</p>

<p>"Where'll we go to make them? Back to South Chicago?"</p>

<p>"Lake Station is nearer. We'll come down there and
ascertain the extent of the damage. It may be that we
shall have to go back to South Chicago if the injury is at
all serious."</p>

<p>"All right," acquiesced Harris. "I'll be able to do
some telephoning and get a few more men out here from
headquarters. I'll have them bring rifles, and then we'll
give Brady a set-to that he'll remember."</p>

<p>"I ditn't see Matt in der blace," mourned Carl.</p>

<p>"He may have been there," said Harris. "There were
two sheds, and they may be keeping your chum a prisoner
in one of them."</p>

<p>"Vell, vile ve're avay fixing oop der Eagle, meppy dose
fellers pack dere vill fly off mit demselufs in der Hawk.
Oof dey do dot, den ve vill have some drouple for our
pains."</p>

<p>"We shall have to keep watch of the sky in the direction
of the swamp," said Jerrold. "By doing that we
can tell whether or not the Hawk gets away."</p>

<p>Carl made that his work.</p>

<p>"I don'd know how I can see mit der naked eye ven
ve ged py Lake Sdation," he remarked.</p>

<p>"We'll have to hunt up a spyglass, or a pair of binoculars,"
suggested Harris.</p>

<p>"Vat oof der Hawk moofs pefore we ged dem?"</p>

<p>"Then we'll be up against it, and no mistake."</p>

<p>There was a lot of excitement in the little town of
Lake Station when a real, sure enough air-ship descended
close to the blacksmith shop. The whole population
gathered and stared.</p>

<p>While Jerrold was busy tinkering with his crippled
motor, Carl succeeded in finding an old-fashioned spyglass
and climbed with it to the top of the highest building
in town. There he perched himself on the edge of
the roof and watched continually in the direction of Willoughby's
swamp.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harris had been talking with police headquarters
in South Chicago. As a result, three officers
were detailed to catch the first train for Lake Station.</p>

<p>The repairs to be made to the Eagle were somewhat
extensive, and taxed the capacity of the blacksmith shop.
Had Jerrold been in his own workroom he could have
fixed up the motor more easily and quickly, but to take
the Eagle back to South Chicago would have resulted in
a loss of time.</p>

<p>Hour after hour the inventor labored, helped by the
blacksmith and eyed with wonder by the townspeople.
The detail of officers arrived, and they could do nothing
but wait until the Eagle was ready to carry them to the
"island" in the swamp. Any attempt to reach the
"island" on foot was hardly to be considered.</p>

<p>While Jerrold's labors were nearing completion, a yell
from Carl called the attention of Harris.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" he shouted.</p>

<p>Carl was dancing around on the roof top, waving the
spyglass frantically.</p>

<p>"Come oop!" he cried, wildly. "Der Hawk is gedding
avay mit itseluf! Ach, plazes, vat a luck!"</p>

<p>Harris made haste to reach the top of the building
where Carl had been patiently waiting and watching.</p>

<p>"Pud der spyglass to your eye, Harris," said Carl,
"und look off to der nort'. Ach, dose fellers haf made
some ged-avays, und I bed you dey have dook Matt
along!"</p>

<p>With the glass at his eye, Harris swept the horizon in
the direction indicated by Carl. Finally he found what
he was looking for&mdash;an oblong blot gliding through the
heavens and proceeding in a northerly direction.</p>

<p>"That's the Hawk, all right," said he, in a tone of
intense disappointment, "but why is it heading in that
direction?"</p>

<p>"Prady vouldn't dare go pack by Sout' Chicago," said
Carl. "I bed you somet'ing for nodding he has got
anodder hang-oudt in dot tirections. Ach, vat vill I do
for dot bard oof mine?"</p>

<p>Gloomily the two descended from the roof, and Carl
returned the spyglass to its owner.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the Eagle was ready for flight, and
the officers and Carl got aboard. It was decided to proceed
to the swamp and look over the "island" and then,
if nothing of importance developed, to return to South
Chicago.</p>

<p>The Eagle's motor, apparently, worked as well as ever,
and the four miles separating Willoughby's swamp from
Lake Station were covered in record time.</p>

<p>As they neared the "island" the officers made ready to
use their guns. There was no hostile demonstration,
however, and not a soul was anywhere in sight. The
Eagle descended, and the officers, accompanied by the
anxious Carl, proceeded to make a search.</p>

<p>They found nothing but two meagerly furnished houses,
apparently recently deserted. Silence reigned everywhere,
ominous of events that had happened.</p>

<p>"Vell," said Carl, gloomily, "dis means dot I haf got
to do some more looking for Modor Matt. Der gang
haf made off mit him some more, und I vas so tisappointed
as I can't dell."</p>

<p>For that matter, they were all disappointed&mdash;Jerrold
in particular. Motor Matt had served Jerrold well, and
the inventor had been anxious to make him some repayment
in kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was nothing left for the air-ship party to
do but to point the Eagle toward home. As the air-ship
passed the rolling mills and came close to the balloon
house where Brady had formerly housed the Hawk, it
was observed by those in the car that the doors of the
big building were closed, and that two officers had mounted
guard in front of them.</p>

<p>"That means something," muttered Harris. "Drop
lower, Jerrold, so I can talk with those two cops."</p>

<p>Jerrold descended until the top of the car was nearly
on a level with the balloon house, and Harris leaned over
the guard rail.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he called. "What are you fellows doing
there?"</p>

<p>"Watching the air-ship," was the astounding answer.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that Brady's air-ship is in that
balloon house?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Has Brady been captured?"</p>

<p>"Why, no. You went after him, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"We went after him, but he and his men fired on us
and damaged our motor. We went to Lake Station to
fix the machinery, and while we were there we caught
sight of the Hawk, through a spyglass, making north.
As soon as we could, we started for the swamp, but there
was no one there. Naturally, we supposed that Brady
and his gang had made their escape, and it's mighty
surprising to hear that the Hawk is back in its old cage
and didn't bring Brady along."</p>

<p>"The Hawk brought Motor Matt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carl gave a yell and nearly fell out of the car.</p>

<p>"Modor Matt?" he shouted. "Vas you shdringing me,
oder iss it shdraight goots?"</p>

<p>"I'm giving it to you straight," answered the officer on
the ground. "Motor Matt got away from the swamp
and brought two prisoners with him, in the Hawk. They
were two of the men who robbed Jerrold of his plans."</p>

<p>"Zum lauderbach haben, mich shtets&mdash;&mdash;" began Carl,
singing loudly and then interrupting himself to gloat.
"Dot's my bard vat dit dot! Yah, so! Leedle Modor
Matt who iss alvays doing t'ings vat you don'd oxbect.
He has shtarred himseluf some more, you bed you! Vere
iss Modor Matt now, officer?" Carl called down.</p>

<p>"He took a train into Chicago&mdash;said he was behind his
schedule for that five-day race. The two prisoners are
at police headquarters."</p>

<p>"Well, by thunder!" muttered Harris, mopping his face
with a red handkerchief, "that Motor Matt must be a
regular young phenomenon!"</p>

<p>"I never heard of anything to beat him!" averred Jerrold.</p>

<p>"Und you nefer vill!" declared Carl. "He iss vone oof
dose fellers vat can't be peat."</p>

<p>"You might take us to police headquarters, Jerrold,"
suggested Harris.</p>

<p>"Und you mighdt shtop on der vay py der railroadt
sdation," piped Carl. "I vant to ged py Chicago so
kevick as der nation vill led me."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Carl next saw Matt, the young motorist was
spinning around the great oval in a Jarrot machine, which
he knew so well and had driven to victory in Kansas.
The five-day race was not for one driver alone, but several
drivers were to be at the steering wheel of each car.
Matt had reached the Coliseum just in time to take his
place in the racing schedule.</p>

<p>Every time Matt whirled around the oval, Carl had
something to say to him, but it was not until evening
that the boys were able to get together for a talk.</p>

<p>They decided between them that Brady, and those
whom Matt had left on the "island," must have made
their escape from the swamp by a secret route known
only to themselves.</p>

<p>Where Harper, the driver of the Hawk was, was likewise
a mystery to the police.</p>

<p>Matt had turned the bag of loot stolen from Hartz &amp;
Greer over to the police with instructions to say that it
was recovered by Miss Brady, and that no reward would
be accepted for its return.</p>

I could have more of it!"</p>

<p>His wish was destined to fulfillment, for, as events
proved, his thrilling work in South Chicago and at Willoughby's
swamp was but the beginning of a series of
air-ship experiences. Matt may have congratulated himself

Brady, but Brady was by no means done with Matt&mdash;as
will be made clear in the story to follow.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BIG_CYPRESS" id="THE_BIG_CYPRESS">THE BIG CYPRESS.</a></h2>


<p>The rifle cracked and the piece of boiler plate, which had
been erected as target against the bank fifty yards away, fell
shattered like a pane of glass.</p>

<p>"How's that, Colonel Fearon?" coolly inquired the young
fellow, who had fired the shot, as he turned to the tall, sallow-faced
man who stood beside him.</p>

<p>A curious expression crossed the latter's face, but he answered
quickly, "Amazing, Rutherford! Simply astonishing.
I could never have believed such a thing possible. A pom-pom
shell could hardly have smashed the plate more effectually."</p>

<p>The boy&mdash;he was hardly more&mdash;laughed. "I thought it
would startle you, colonel. Will you feel justified in sending
me up to Washington?"</p>

<p>"I reckon that's the place for you to go to, Rutherford.
The war department'll need that new bullet of yours in their
business. You mean to tell me you invented that bullet all
by yourself?"</p>

<p>"I did, colonel. You see, I was always fond of dabbling in
chemistry and the idea for this came to me one day when I
was at work in my father's store. I didn't worry about it
much, until the poor old man went broke, and then it struck
me there was money in it. It was the mayor of our town,
Orangeville, told me to come to you. He said that you
could give me the proper introductions."</p>

<p>"He was right," said Colonel Fearon. "I can fix you up
with the proper people. Let me have a shot."</p>

<p>Lionel Rutherford handed the colonel a cartridge, which
outwardly looked precisely similar to an ordinary rifle cartridge.
He then walked across the lawn of fine Bermuda
grass, put a fresh piece of steel plate in position, and came
back.</p>

<p>The colonel fired, and, as before, the tough steel simply
sprang to pieces and lay in scattered fragments on the grass.</p>

<p>"I reckon there's more money in this than in keeping
store," said the colonel thoughtfully. "Rutherford, I'll be
pleased if you'll stay here at my house for a day or two till
I can write to the proper people."</p>

<p>Young Rutherford thanked him warmly and the two
walked back toward the long, low, wide verandaed house.</p>

<p>Late that night the colonel and his son, Randal Fearon,
sat together in the well-appointed smoking room and talked
earnestly in low tones.</p>

<p>"There's thousands in it, father," said the younger man
sharply. "Thousands!"</p>

<p>"I know that as well as yourself," returned the other irritably.
"But the invention's not yours or mine."</p>

<p>"What's Rutherford?" sneered Randal. "Here he is, a
fellow who's never known anything of life, who's lived all
his days in a little one-horse backwoods town, and now he's
going to roll in riches while we are on the edge of bankruptcy."</p>

<p>He paused, and glanced at his father, who sat fidgeting
uneasily. The colonel, fine-looking man that he was, was as
weak-willed as his tall, thin, sharp-faced son was strong.</p>

<p>"A real nice scandal there'll be when we go smash," went
on Randal Fearon. "Think of the headlines. 'Fraudulent
Bankruptcy. Prominent Floridian lives beyond his means.'
How the yellow press'll revel in it!"</p>

<p>Again the colonel moved uneasily. "I don't see how you're
going to get the specifications from him, anyhow," he said
at last.</p>

<p>"You leave that to me," replied Randal with sneering emphasis.</p>

<p>"Look you here, Randal, I won't have any violence." For
once Colonel Fearon spoke decidedly.</p>

<p>"I guess you needn't worry your head about that," answered
Randal. "I've got the whole plan cut and dried.
You've asked him to stay?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the colonel. "He will stay."</p>

<p>Randal laughed as if pleased. "That's all right. To-morrow
we'll settle it, Pete Dally and I."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you in the morning. Don't worry yourself. As
you are so anxious to avoid it, I promise you there shall be
no violence."</p>

<p>Randal chuckled in ugly fashion as he got up, flung the
stump of his cigar into the fireplace, and, lighting a small
hand lamp, left the room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"How much farther have we got to go before we run into
any of this game you talked about, Mr. Fearon?" asked
Rutherford as he stopped and wiped the perspiration from his
streaming face.</p>

<p>"I thought we'd have seen a buck before now," replied
Randal Fearon. "We don't often have to come this far into
the Big Cypress to find game, do we, Pete?"</p>

<p>"No, sah; we gen'rally finds it quite clos' to the aidge of
de swamp," said Pete, who was a burly, square-shouldered
negro with a face as black as ebony.</p>

<p>Rutherford was rather puzzled. That morning Randal
Fearon had suggested that it would be very good fun to go
shooting in the Big Cypress, a huge tract of wild, swampy
forest, the edge of which was about five miles from Colonel
Fearon's place.</p>

<p>"You might try the effect of some of your explosive bullets,"
Randal had suggested; and Rutherford had laughed
and said that there wouldn't be much left of any game
smaller than a buffalo or an elephant if struck by one of his
projectiles.</p>

<p>All the same, being a keen sportsman, he had willingly
agreed to the shoot. What puzzled him was that they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
have tramped for hours through this steaming bush, which
reeked with signs of game, and yet not seen a single thing to
shoot at.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry. We shall find deer soon," said Randal
when Rutherford expressed his astonishment. "We're getting
near a good place now. I reckon we'd better stop and
eat our dinner first. Pete, make a fire."</p>

<p>Pete Dally dropped the big haversack he was carrying over
his broad shoulders, and obeyed. In a very few minutes a
fire was blazing, and the fragrant fumes of frying bacon and
strong coffee filled the close, steamy air. Lionel Rutherford,
tired by the long tramp and the hot-house atmosphere of the
jungle, enjoyed the meal greatly.</p>

<p>After they had finished they marched on again. They had
left the pine trees behind, and were pushing along a narrow
track through a forest of great ilex, bastard oak, and magnolia.
The undergrowth was of saw palmetto, growing in
huge, impenetrable clumps, among which the muddy track
wound in and out.</p>

<p>The scent of yellow jasmine was almost stifling, but the
only life visible was an occasional cardinal bird with its
vivid crimson plumage, or a stub-tailed water moccasin which
raised its triangular, copper-hued head with an ugly hiss and
dragged itself sluggishly out of sight among the tangled
herbage.</p>

<p>The path was so narrow that they were compelled to walk
in single file. Randal made Pete lead the way. More than
once the negro had tried to drop behind, but each time Randal
roughly ordered him to push ahead.</p>

<p>The silence of the swamp grew as oppressive as the intense
heat. It began to get upon young Rutherford's nerves.</p>

<p>"A tough place to get lost in," he said at last.</p>

<p>Randal turned quickly. There was a queer expression on
his sharp face as he replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, pretty bad, I reckon."</p>

<p>Somehow, Rutherford fancied there was something sinister
in his tone.</p>

<p>"I don't like the chap," he thought to himself. "I wish I
hadn't come." Then common sense got the better of his
fears. "It's the place, not the people, that's worrying me.
These big hamaks are worse than a desert. There you can
see the sky; here it's like one great, green prison."</p>

<p>"Look out, sah. Dah's a wild cat in dat tree," suddenly
hissed Pete Dally, and slipped out of the path into the thicket.
"Quiet or youse done frighten him."</p>

<p>Rutherford, all excitement, slipped his rifle from his shoulder.</p>

<p>But Randal barred his way. He was standing still, peering
up into the tree indicated.</p>

<p>"Where? I don't see it," he exclaimed harshly.</p>

<p>"Dere it am, sah. On dat big fork," declared Pete, pointing.
And then as Randal stepped forward, the negro slipped
back round a clump of palmetto, and Rutherford felt a hand
fall sharply on his arm, while these words were whispered
in his ear:</p>

<p>"Dat man mean you no good, sah. Watch me, an' doan'
do what he say."</p>

<p>He turned in amazement, but Peter was already gone. He
had glided back, and was standing at Randal's elbow, pointing
out the exact spot where he alleged he had seen the cat.</p>

<p>But there was no cat there now, and Rutherford wondered
if there ever had been. Randal cursed Pete angrily, and once
more they moved forward.</p>

<p>Rutherford, more worried than he cared to own even to
himself, followed, as before, the last of the little procession.</p>

<p>It was getting late and the bullfrogs had begun to bellow
harshly in unseen pools in the forest. But there was no decrease
in the sullen heat. Not a breath stirred the moist,
stagnant air, and the farther they went the thicker grew the
tangled vegetation till there was no longer any sign of a
path. In unbroken silence the three forced their way through
primeval forest.</p>

<p>Presently trees broke away, and they stood upon the muddy
marge of a reedy lagoon, across the stagnant waters of which
the low sun cast a lurid light.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said Randal Fearon sharply. "This is
where the deer come down to drink. You wait, Rutherford,
in the bushes here, and you'll soon get a shot. Pete and I
will take up our places on the far side. Then whatever comes
some of us will get a buck."</p>

<p>"Watch me, and don't do what he says." Pete's words
were ringing in Rutherford's ears. He cast a glance at the
negro. Pete made a quick sign, which the English boy took
to mean that he was to follow instead of remaining.</p>

<p>Next moment Randal had plunged off through the palmetto
with Pete at his heels.</p>

<p>"What's it all mean?" muttered Rutherford angrily. "Is
Fearon fooling me, or is it Pete? Of the two, I infinitely
prefer the nigger. I'll do what he says."</p>

<p>He left his shelter, and moved as quietly as possible on
the track of the other two.</p>

<p>Sure enough, they did go round the pool! Rutherford
began to wonder if he was wrong; whether Pete for some
unknown reason was fooling him.</p>

<p>The going was dreadful. The ground below the almost
impenetrable palmetto was deep mud. Swarms of mosquitoes
rose and stung viciously. Lionel was afraid that the crashing
of the parted bushes would betray him.</p>

<p>He knew he was falling a long way behind, and panic
seized him that he might lose the others. Though young
Rutherford had lived all his life in America, yet he had never
been in a big swamp like this. The store had kept him busy.</p>

<p>At last he reached the spot which Randal had pointed out
as his own shooting station. To his horror, there was no one
there. Randal and Pete had both disappeared. He was alone
in the tangled heart of this monstrous swamp, and knew that
without help he could never hope to find his way out.</p>

<p>After the first moment of panic Lionel Rutherford pulled
himself together. He had plenty of pluck. He rapidly considered
the situation. For some reason best known to himself
Randal Fearon wished to abandon him, to lose him in the
swamp. But he himself had no idea of dying of hunger,
fever, or snakebite in this impenetrable wilderness. He had
two courses open&mdash;go back and try to find his way out along
the trail they had come by, or follow after Randal and Pete.</p>

<p>There were no objections to the first. It was a very long
way, and it was doubtful if he could find it even in broad
daylight. As it was, it would be dark in an hour. Besides,
Pete had certainly meant him to follow.</p>

<p>Randal must mean to spend the night in the swamp. That
was clear. Therefore he must have some camping place.</p>

<p>"I'll follow," muttered the boy between set teeth, and
started off.</p>

<p>Though the sun was not yet down, it was already dusk
beneath the thick shade of the towering timber, and in the
half light the trail was most difficult to follow. The others
had long ago passed out of hearing.</p>

<p>The night life of the swamp was waking. Enormous owls
hooted weirdly, then came the thundering bellow of a bull
alligator, and presently above all these the ghastly, half-human
shriek of a panther calling to its mate.</p>

<p>Stumbling and struggling, Lionel hurried on. In a little
he came to a thick belt of tall saw grass. The two pairs of
footmarks entered it, but the trails beyond were so confused
with the passage of deer and other animals that the boy recognized
with a shock that he could not follow the human
footsteps.</p>

<p>Very near despair, he turned back. No, he could not find
Randal's trail. He stopped. "I'm done!" he muttered hopelessly,
and stood straining his ears for any sound of his
former companions.</p>

<p>Just then, as he was almost giving up, he caught sight of
a morsel of something white stuck on a broken stem beside
the trail. It was a tiny piece of paper, and on it, marked
with a muddy finger tip, an arrow pointing in a certain direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pete!" exclaimed Lionel joyfully. A load rolled off his
mind. Marking the direction carefully, he pushed on fast.
Now he was on the lookout, he found other signs; a broken
twig, a stick, laid in the path.</p>

<p>Darkness fell rapidly. There is little twilight in Florida.</p>

<p>"They can't go much farther," he said. He was right.
In a very short time the dull glow of a fire showed where the
others had camped.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" he asked himself. "Go right up and
tackle Randal Fearon? No; he'd have some excuse ready,
and I'd only get Pete into trouble. I must wait till Randal
goes to sleep."</p>

<p>The mosquitoes were savage. Young Rutherford, tired and
hungry, found it maddening to wait in the damp gloom, and
watch Randal gorge on the supper which Pete cooked.
Nearly two hours passed before Randal, having finished a
cigar, rolled himself, head and all, in a blanket and lay down.</p>

<p>A few minutes more, and a snore told Rutherford it was
safe to venture closer.</p>

<p>Pete heard him, and glided out. The black man chuckled
silently when he saw the boy. "Reckoned you'd be along,
sah. You foun' de sign Pete lef' for you. Now de firs' thing
is you eat. Den we talk."</p>

<p>He put corn, bread, and bacon into Rutherford's hands, and
the boy made a hearty meal.</p>

<p>"Now, sah," said Pete. "You see what dat man want to
do. He lose you in de swamp, den go home, say you fell in
de water and was drowned. Den he an' his dad, dey take
dat blow-up bullet ob yours an' sell him."</p>

<p>Lionel Rutherford was aghast. He had never dreamed of
such wickedness.</p>

<p>"But we beat dem," went on Pete, with a chuckle. "I like
you, an' I hate dat Randal."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" asked Lionel eagerly.</p>

<p>"Why, we play de same trick on him he try play on you.
We take all de stuff, go off, an' leab him. He no more find
his way out of de Big Cypress dan you. Only Pete know de
trails."</p>

<p>"That won't do, Pete," returned Lionel sharply. "I won't
be any party to murder."</p>

<p>Pete was amazed. He expostulated strongly.</p>

<p>"No, I'll tell you what we will do, Pete. We'll go off and
hide, and let him think he's lost. We'll follow and watch,
and when he's got the soul nearly scared out of him we'll
find him again. See?"</p>

<p>Pete saw. He chuckled again in high good humor. "Dat's
a very fine game, sah. We play dat to-morrow morning.
Now I take de things away, an' when Randal wake he find no
breakfast, no Pete, no nothing."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"He done lost hisself, sure pop!" declared Pete.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock next morning, and Lionel Rutherford
and the negro had been following Randal for more than an
hour.</p>

<p>His language when he woke up and found Pete gone had
been something appalling.</p>

<p>Having found that this did no good, he had started off back
along the track they had come by on the previous day, but in
less than ten minutes he was off it; and the two, who followed
at a discreet distance, had watched his growing fury
and fright when he found himself quite lost in the pathless
depths of the wilderness.</p>

<p>"He can't go dat way much furder," observed Pete. "He
gettin' down in de deal bad swamp. He go in up to his fool
neck if he don't be keerful."</p>

<p>Sure enough the quaking muck-land broke beneath the
young scoundrel's weight, and in he went. With a yell of
fright he caught at a branch, pulled himself out, and staggered
back.</p>

<p>"What's he going to do now?" whispered Lionel.</p>

<p>"Reckon he going climb dat tree an' see whar he am."</p>

<p>Pete was right. Randal began shinning up the stem of a
tall, slender tree by the water's edge, the only one which
seemed to give a possible view of any of the surrounding
country. No doubt he thought he might spot the trail from
the summit.</p>

<p>Rutherford, who had been staring hard at the tree, suddenly
clutched Pete's arm. "What's that thing up in the branches
just above him?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>Pete took a long stare. "By golly, sah, it am a snake!
An' a mighty big one, sure!"</p>

<p>Rutherford started forward, slipping a cartridge into his
rifle.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, sah," whispered Pete. "Dat ain't no poison
snake. It am only a old white oak snake."</p>

<p>"Looks like an ugly customer," muttered Lionel.</p>

<p>At this moment Randal reached the first boughs and stood
up. The movement alarmed the snake, which raised its ugly
head and hissed sharply.</p>

<p>Randal heard the hiss, and, turning, saw the reptile. He
gave a scream of terror, and almost lost his hold. Then he
backed rapidly on to a branch which actually overhung the
creek.</p>

<p>"Time to end this now," said Rutherford, raising his rifle.
"I shall shoot the snake."</p>

<p>Pete seized his arm. "De snake won't hurt him, sah. But
dey will."</p>

<p>He pointed to the water. The big alligator had seen Randal,
and silently moved up till it was just beneath him. Another
of almost equal size had also risen to the surface.
Yellow eyes agleam, the hideous brutes were watching for
this rash intruder upon their domain.</p>

<p>At the very instant there was a snapping crackle. The
bough on which Randal cowered was breaking. And the
wretched man, clinging vainly for a hold, had caught sight
of the huge reptiles below. He screamed till the forest resounded
with his agonizing cries.</p>

<p>He snatched at the branches above, but could reach only
twigs, which broke in his grasp. He was falling clean into
the open jaws of the alligators.</p>

<p>If Rutherford's rifle had been loaded only with an ordinary
cartridge nothing could have saved Randal. It was just pure
luck that he had flung one of his explosives into the breech.</p>

<p>Simultaneous with Randal's fall the rifle spoke. The bullet
caught the nearest alligator on the side of the head, and
the air was full of mangled fragments of flesh and bone.</p>

<p>Into this horrible geyser Randal dropped heavily and vanished.</p>

<p>Next moment he rose again, and struck out madly for the
bank.</p>

<p>"I can't shoot again," cried Lionel. "I should kill him if
I did."</p>

<p>"Dere ain't no need to," said the negro. "You done scared
de stuffin' out ob dat oder gator."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness he's safe," exclaimed Lionel as Randal
scrambled ashore and fell in a heap on the bank. "Now
we'd better get him home."</p>

<p>Pete laughed. "Yes, sah. I reckon he done had enough
ob de Big Cypress."</p>

<p>When Randal came round Rutherford soon realized he
had no more to fear. The fellow's nerve was broken. He
shivered and trembled like a frightened child.</p>

<p>They took him home, and then Lionel went boldly to Colonel
Fearon, and told him the whole story plump and plain.
When he had finished the colonel sat speechless. His face
was gray and pinched.</p>

<p>Lionel looked at him. "I shan't make any trouble for you,"
he said coolly. "All I want is those introductions. Write
them now, and I'll take them myself to Washington."</p>

<p>Without a word the colonel obeyed.</p>

<p>Lionel Rutherford is now a rich and rising man. Pete
is his faithful major-domo. Whenever Lionel gets a holiday
the two go off down south for a week or two of shooting.
But they never again penetrated the desolate depths of the
Great Cypress.</p>

<p>Most five-cent weeklies are founded upon the adventures of boy wonders who perform all sorts of
impossible feats and who never act or talk as a boy really does. This is displeasing to the intelligent boy of
the present day, who is better educated, and who, consequently, demands more logical reading than the
old-time boy did.</p>

<p>The boys who want to learn something from what they read, as well as to be interested by it, will
never find another publication that will satisfy them so well as MOTOR STORIES. "Motor Matt" is not
an impossible boy character. He is simply a youth who has had considerable training in a machine shop
where motors of all kinds were repaired, and who is possessed of a genius for mechanics. His sense of
right and wrong is strongly developed, and his endeavors to insure certain people a square deal lead him
into a series of the most astonishing, but at the same time the most natural, adventures that ever befell a boy.</p>

<p>Buy the current number from your newsdealer. We feel sure that you will be just as enthusiastic
about it as the fifty thousand other boys throughout the United States have become.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
