5YOUNG SWAIGDER
or
THE FORCE OF RUNES
It was the young Swaigder,
             With the little ball he played;
The ball flew into the Damsel       s lap,
             And pale her cheeks it made.
The ball flew into the Damsel       s bower.
             He went of it in quest;
Before he out of the bower came,
             Much care had filled his breast!
       The ball, the ball thou shouldst not fling,
             Shouldst cast it not at me;
There sits a maid in a foreign land,
             She sighs and weeps for thee.
p.
6       Thou never more shalt peace obtain,
             Or close in sleep thine eyes,
Till thou has freed the lovely maid,
             In thrall for thee that lies.       
It was the young Swaigder,
             Placed his cap upon his head,
And into the high chamber
             Unto his knights he sped.
       Here, quaffing mead from out the shell
             Sit ye, my Courtmen bold,
Whilst I go to the mountain drear,
             Speech with the Dead to hold!
       Here, quaffing mead and ruddy wine,
             Sit ye my men so brave,
Whilst I go to the mountain drear,
             With my mother speech to have!       
It was the young Swaigder,
             And he began to call       
Riven were wall and marble stone,
             And the hill began to fall.
p.
7       Who is it breaks my sleep,
             And works me such annoy?
Deep, deep below the earth so swart
             Can I not peace enjoy?       
       O, it is the young Swaigder,
             The son thou lovest dear;
He fain would good advice from thee,
             His darling mother, hear.
       For I have now a step-mother,
             So harsh she is of mood,
And she upon me Runes has cast
             For a maid I ne       er have
view       d.       
       I will give thee a noble horse,
             Shall bear thee at thy need,
And he will run upon the sea
             As on the verdant mead.
       And I will to thee a napkin give,
                    Tis of Ager wool entire,
Before thee on the board shall stand,
             What meat thou shalt desire.
p.
8       I will to thee a deer       s horn give,
             Mark well its golden gleam;
All the drink thou wishest for,
             From the golden horn shall stream.
       And I will give to thee a sword,
             Hardened in Dragon       s blood;
It will glitter like a beam
             When thou ridest through the wood.
       I will give to thee a barque,
             Its white sails silk shall be;
Shall move as well on the verdant earth
             As on the foaming sea.       
Their silken sails on the gilded yard
             So wide, so wide they spread;
Away they sailed to the distant land,
             Where dwelt the lovely maid.
And they have cast their anchors
             Upon the yellow sand;
It was the young Swaigder
             Who stepped the first to land.
p.
9It was the young Swaigder,
             His ship to the shore he steers;
And the first man there that met him,
             Was a man of many years.
It was then the ancient man
             Was the first to make enquire:
       O, what is the name of the young swain
             With the sword, and the look of fire?       
       O, he is hight young Swaigder,
             So wide his fame doth fly;
And he for a maid is pining sore
             On whom he ne       er set eye.       
       There is within this land a maid,
             Who pining long hath been
For a swain that hight is Swaigder,
             And him she ne       er has seen.       
       If longs she after a young swain
             On whom she ne       er set eye,
And he is hight young Swaigder,
             He is here in verity.
p.
10       Now do thou hear, thou ancient man,
             If it as thou sayest be,
Become I King upon this land,
             I       ll make a Count of thee.       
              Midst of yonder verdant wood
             Stands the castle of the maid;
The house is of gray marble stone,
             The court with steel belaid.
       The house is of grey marble stone
             The court with steel is floored,
The portal is of ruddy gold,
             Twelve bears before it guard.
       In middle of the maiden       s court
             A linden spreads its shade,
If truly thou art Swaigder,
             Hie forward unafraid.       
Away then rode young Swaigder,
             Cast towards the gate his eye;
And all the locks that before it hung,
             Down fell they instantly.
p.
11Then withered the leaf, then withered the linden,
             And the grass at the linden       s root;
And the twelve bears who the portal guard
             They fell at the hero       s foot.
When he came into the castle-court,
             He smooth        d his array,
Then proudly up to the high, high hall
             To the King he took his way.
       Hail to thee, hail to thee, heathen King,
             Who dost at the wide board sit,
Wilt thou give me thy daughter fair?
             Return me an answer fit.       
       I have no daughter, I have no daughter,
             No daughter but one have I;
And she so sorely longing
             For a young swain doth lie.
       For a young swain whom she has never seen
             My daughter longing lies;
The swain he hight is Swaigder,
             So far his fame it hies.       
p.
12In went the little serving boy,
             Wore a kirtle white to see:
       If thou dost long for Swaigder,
             Know that hither come is he.       
In then came the lovely maid,
             In white silk clad was she:
       Now welcome, welcome my dearest heart,
             Young Swaigder, welcome be!       
       Wilt thou consent baptized to be,
             And the Christian faith receive,
And follow me to Denmark
             With young Swaigder to live?       
       Willingly I baptized will be,
             Will the Christian faith receive;
And will follow thee to Denmark,
             Young Swaigder, with thee to live.       
On a Thursday she baptiz        d was,
             She the Christian faith received;
On a Sunday they their bridal held,
             And ever in peace they lived.
p.
13They kept their bridal feast for a day,
             They kept the same for nine;
And there sat waiting the ancient man,
             And through all of them did pine.
Be thanks to brave young Swaigder,
             He kept so well his word;
A Knight he made of that ancient man,
             Set him highest at the board.
Now joyful is young Swaigder,
             His trouble all has fled;
He King became upon that land,
             She Queen, when her sire was dead.
p.
14THE HAIL STORM <a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]
As in Horunga haven
We fed the crow and raven,
I heard the tempest breaking
Of demon Thorgerd       s waking;
Sent by the fiend in anger,
With din and stunning clangor;
To crush our might intended,
Gigantic hail descended.
A pound the smallest pebble
Did weigh, and others treble;
It drifted, dealing slaughter,
And blood ran out like water,
p.
15Ran recking, red and horrid,
From battered cheek and forehead;
But, though so rudely greeted,
No Jornsberg man retreated.
With anger ever sharper,
Thorgerda fierce, and Yrpr,
Shot lightning from each finger,
Which sped and did not linger.
Then sank our brave in numbers
To cold, eternal slumbers;
There lay the good and gallant,
Renowned for warlike talent.
To bide the storm unable
Our chieftain hewed his cable,
And with his ship departed       
We follow, broken-hearted;
For in Horunga haven
Our bravest feed the raven;
We did our best, but no men
Can stand        gainst hail and foemen.

16ROSMER MEREMAN <a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]
In Denmark once a lady dwelt,
             Hellelil the name she bore;
A castle new that lady built,
             It shone all Denmark o       er.
Her daughter dear was stolen away,
             She sought for her far and near;
The more she sought the less she found,
             To her great distress and care.
She bid a noble ship be built,
             Therein gilt masts did stand;
With valiant knights and courtmen bold
             She caused it to be manned.
p.
17Her sons she followed to the strand,
             With many a fond caress;
For eight long years they sailed away,
             Enduring much distress.
For eight years had they sailed away,
             So long they thought the tide,
When they sailed before a lofty hill,
             And straight to land they hied.
Then peeped the Damsel Swanelil
             Forth from the mountain brow:
       O whence can be these stranger swains,
             As guests that seek us now?       
The youngest brother then replied,
             So ready of speech was he:
       A widow       s three poor sons we are,
             So long we       ve sailed the sea.
       Dame Hellelil our mother is,
             We were born on Denmark       s ground;
From us our sister stolen was,
             And her we have yet not found.       
p.
18       If thou wert born on Danish ground,
             And Dame Hellelil be thy mother
Then I thy beloved sister am
             And thou art my youngest brother.
       Now do thou hear, my youngest brother,
             Why didst not at home remain?
If thou hadst a thousand thousand lives
             Thou none of them couldst retain.       
She placed him in the smallest nook
             She could in the house espy:
She bade him for sake of the highest God,
             Neither to laugh nor cry.
Rosmer came from the ocean home,
             And straight he fell to bann:
       O I can smell by my right hand
             That here is a Christian man.       
       A Bird with a dead man       s shank in its mouth,<br
/>
             Chanced over our house to fly;
He cast it in, I cast it out,
             And that full speedily.       
p.
19A noble meal she then prepared,
             And she gave him many a kiss:
       O here is come my sister       s son,
             It would grieve me him to miss.
       My sister       s son is here arrived
             From the land where I first drew breath;
Now give him, my lord, thy firm, firm oath,
             Thou       lt do unto him no scathe.       
       If here has come thy sister       s son
             From the native land of both,
To do him ne       er any kind of hurt,
             I swear by my highest oath.       
It was the lofty Rosmer King
             To two serving swains did call:
       Bid ye proud Swanelil       s sister       s son
             Attend me in the hall.       
It was Swanelil       s sister       s son,
             Before Rosmer should appear;
His heart it fluttered, his body it shivered,
             He stood in such mighty fear.
p.
20Then took Rosmer her sister       s son,
             Placed him upon his knee;
He stroked him so tenderly on the face
             That        twas yellow and blue to see.
Then answered proud Dame Swanelil:
                    Thou forget       st, Sir Rosmer, mayhap,<br
/>
Thou hast not fingers small enough
             To stroke so little a chap.       
And he was there till the years were five,
             Then he longed for his native land:
       Now cause, O sister Swanelil,
             That I       m set on the yellow strand.       
It was proud Dame Swanelil
                    Fore Rosmer goes to stand;
       The swain so long has been by the sea,
             That he sighs for his native land.       
       If the swain has been so long by the sea
             That he sighs for his native land,
I will give him a chest of gold,
             To be subject to his hand.       
p.
21       Wilt thou give him a chest of gold,
             To be subject to his hand?
Hear thou now, my noble heart       s dear,
             Take him to his native land.       
It was proud Dame Swanelil,
             So cunning a trick she played;
She took thereout the ruddy gold all,
             And herself in the chest she laid.
He took the man upon his back,
             And the chest in his mouth he       s
ta       en;
And so he went the long, long way
             Across the land and the main.
       Now have I borne thee to thy land,
             Thou seest both sun and moon;
I conjure thee by the highest God
             Name Swanelil to none.       
Rosmer sprang into the sea amain,
             The water splashed to the sky;
And when he came to the mountain home
             No Swanelil could he spy,
p.
22When he came to the mountain home
             Gone was the belov       d of his heart;
He sprang so wild about the hill,
             And changed to a flint rock swart.
There was rejoicing in Hellelil       s court,
             They rejoiced in many a way;
Back to their friends her children are come,
             Who had been so long away.

23THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER
No. II. <a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]
Sir Peter o       er to the island strayed       
             All underneath a linden wide.
He weds Mettelil, so fair a maid       
             In such peril with her through the forest
ride.
Bracelets of gold he given her hath,
That fills his mother       s breast with wrath.
       If thou wed a maid against my desire,
With her first babe she shall expire!       
He weds her and home he her has ta       en,
To meet her his mother will not deign.
p.
24When they together a year had dwelt,
Herself with child proud Mettelil felt.
Out and in they Mettelil bear,
Death has to her approached so near.
       Since neither live nor die I may,
Take me whence a maid ye brought me away.       
Thereto the Stepmother made reply,
She was tow       rds her disposed maliciously:
       The horses graze upon the mead,
And the coach swains heavy they sleep in bed.       
Sir Peter he stood a little apart,
Mettelil has so grieved his heart.
The coach to her country was turned in haste,
And the horses before it were quickly placed.
And when they came to the verdant moor,
Her chariot broke into pieces four.
       What mighty crime can I have done,
That my own coach        neath me will not run?       
p.
25Sir Peter at no great distance hied,
He was so near he all espied.
       We forthwith will find a remedy,
Thou shalt ride and walk will I.       
       Each noble Dame will know how fit,
I am in this plight in the saddle to sit.       
Proud Mettelil came to her father       s abode,
Her father abroad to receive her strode.
       Welcome, Mettelil, daughter mine,
How speedest thou with that burden of thine?       
       So speeding am I, such plight I am in,
That upon this earth no rest can I win.       
Little Kirsten a may was of goodness rife,
Dearly she loved her brother       s wife.
She to her brother was true of heart,
Of wax two babes she formed with art.
p.
26She wrapt them up in the linen fair,
And took them beneath her cloak with care.
She took them beneath her cloak with care,
And them to her mother she straightway bare.
       My dearest mother, no longer grieve,
The babes of your son in your arms receive.       
       Has Mettelil forth these little sons brought?
Then my dark Runes have availed nought.
       Air and earth I have spelled, save the spot alone,<br
/>
The little spot, my chest stood upon.
       Oh I enchanted have as wide
As she could either walk or ride.
       I have enchanted both earth and wood,
Save the spot whereon my chest it stood.       
No sooner she the words had said,
Than proud Mettelil on the place was laid.
p.
27And when she had come where stood the chest,
Straight of two sons was she released.
That Sir Peter       s mother so mortified,
Full quickly of rage and spite she died.

paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
